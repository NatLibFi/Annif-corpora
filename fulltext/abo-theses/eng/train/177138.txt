Title: Animated Stereotypes – An Analysis of Disney’s Contemporary Portrayals of
Race and Ethnicity
Supervisor: Jason Finch
Abstract:
Walt Disney Animation Studios is currently one of the world’s largest producers of
animated content aimed at children. However, while Disney often has been associated
with themes such as childhood, magic, and innocence, many of the company’s
animated films have simultaneously been criticized for their offensive and quite
problematic take on race and ethnicity, as well their heavy reliance on cultural
stereotypes.
This study aims to evaluate Disney’s portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities, as well
as determine whether or not the nature of the company’s portrayals have become more
culturally sensitive with time. To accomplish this, seven animated feature films
produced by Disney were analyzed. These analyses are of a qualitative nature, with a
focus on imagology and postcolonial literary theory, and the results have
simultaneously been compared to corresponding criticism and analyses by other
authors and scholars.
Based on the overall results of the analyses, it does seem as if Disney is becoming more
progressive and culturally sensitive with time. However, while most of the recent films
are free from the clearly racist elements found in the company’s earlier productions, it
is quite evident that Disney still tends to rely heavily on certain cultural stereotypes.
Furthermore, it seems as if the Disney films that could be regarded as musicals, as well
as films based on other culturally specific material (e.g. legends or folk stories),
frequently include more problematic portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities.
This study provides an overview of Disney’s contemporary portrayals of race and
ethnicity, and the findings presented here could consequently be used to further explore
Disney’s approach towards this issue.

1. Introduction

In our modern society, it might be quite difficult, if not even impossible, to find someone
completely unfamiliar with names like Snow White, Cinderella, Mickey Mouse or Walt
Disney. Ever since the release of Steamboat Willie in 1928, the Walt Disney Company
has been largely dominant in the animated market, and almost a century worth of
animation has seen both children and adults, from all over the world, falling in love with
Disney’s characters and films. Today, this American corporation operates in more than
40 countries, employs nearly 200,000 people, and describes itself as “a leading diversified
international family entertainment and media enterprise” (Disney, 2018). In addition to
being the producer of the animated motion pictures we all know and love, the Walt Disney
Company also owns theme parks, various product lines and a number of broadcasting
networks; such as the American Broadcasting Company and the ESPN sports cable
network. The enterprise has expanded even more since the turn of the century, and is now
the proprietor of studios like 20th Century Fox, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and Pixar
Animation Studios. The Walt Disney Company is, in other words, more than right to
regard itself as diversified – in terms of business.
Ironically, for a company associated with childhood, happiness and innocence,
Disney’s films have frequently been criticized for their gender-portrayals, their offensive
and racist content, and their lack of ethnic diversity in terms of positive characters and
protagonists. While the jive-talking crows in Dumbo (1941), as well as the dramatic love
story of Pocahontas and John Smith (Pocahontas, 1995), surely have entertained and
amused millions of viewers, they have, simultaneously and clearly, offended and agitated
others. Walt Disney himself has had a reputation as an anti-Semite (see e.g. Eliot, 1994),
and many academics have taken interest in the man, the company, and the ideologies that
the two really represent. Some do claim that the modern Walt Disney Company has taken
a step towards the more culturally sensitive film industry, but many argue that Disney
still has a long way to go in terms of positive representations of diversity and
multiculturalism.
In this study, I will delve into the world of Disney animation, with a specific focus
on race and ethnicity. By analyzing a number of animated Disney films, I hope to be able
1

to examine and discuss how Disney portrays race and ethnicity in their modern animated
feature films, and see how – and if – the nature of these portrayals have changed over
time. While issues like gender or sexual orientation might overlap with a topic like this, I
have still chosen to commit solely to one area. This will narrow my scope and make this
topic more suitable to a master’s thesis. Before defining the aims and scope for this study
in more detail, I will first, however briefly, consider the historical perspective regarding
Disney’s relationship with race and ethnicity. While the focus of this thesis will be on
contemporary change in Disney’s racial and ethnic portrayals, it might still be important
to acknowledge the criticism of Disney’s earlier productions. This will set the scene for
this study, as the issues presented here surely will reemerge throughout the thesis. The
following subchapter will consequently provide a historical overview of the Walt Disney
Company and the relevant criticism surrounding some of its films.

1.1 Historical perspective

Walter Elias Disney was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 5, 1901. In 1923, Walter
“Walt” Disney and his brother Roy founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio (which
eventually turned into the Walt Disney Studio). Four years later, the iconic Mickey Mouse
was born (Wasko, 2001). While the Walt Disney Company clearly is one of the most
influential companies of our time, it could also be regarded as one of the most
controversial, since instances of the company’s racial and ethnic stereotyping arguably
can be found in all different eras of Disney filmmaking.
In 1937, the world of animation was forever changed with Disney’s release of
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs – one of the first animated feature-length features ever
made. This marks the beginning of the five-year-period generally known as Disney’s
Golden Age (1937-1942) – an era marked by features such as the successful adaptation
Pinocchio (1940), the already mentioned Dumbo, and the sugar-and-tar (sweet and
innocent, yet tragic and dark) feature Bambi (1942). Another film from the Golden Age,
still criticized for its racist content, is Fantasia (1940). This particular motion picture
featured the controversial character Sunflower; a centaur with a torso of a black girl and
the lower body of a donkey. This character has been extremely criticized for its
caricatured features, as well as for its position as a servant to the other “white” centaurs,
and was eventually removed by Disney (Byrne & McQuillan, 1999). Nevertheless,
2

despite some controversial content, most films released during the Golden Age were still
quite successful.
In 1941, however, Disney came close to bankruptcy and consequently started
producing propagandistic short films for the US government to survive. These short films
usually featured familiar Disney characters; such as the seven dwarves who head into
town to trade their freshly mined gemstones for war bonds (7 Wise Dwarfs, 1941), as well
as Donald Duck who struggles with his nightmares about living in Nazi Germany (Der
Fuehrer’s Face, 1940). This period in Disney animation has, not surprisingly, often been
referred to as the Wartime Era (1943-1949). Disney’s economic weakness during this
time also resulted in feature films based on both animation and live action (Encyclopædia
Britannica, 2018). One of these films was the box-office success Song of the South (1946)
– another Disney product widely criticized for its portrayal of African Americans, as well
as African-American history. Song of the South is set in a post-slavery America, where
no racism seems to exist, and where everyone, irrespective of race and status, is happy; a
phenomenon that Richard M. Breaux has described as “a sanitizing of African-American
history and denial of its and our nation’s racist past” (2010: 399). According to Breaux,
this underlying racism is still present in many of Disney’s films, while the more
straightforward issues, such as what can be seen in Fantasia, might have faded away with
time, as also Western society has become more multicultural and culturally sensitive.
While many of the motion pictures produced during Disney’s Silver Age (19501967) – the third era of Disney filmmaking –– have been regarded as improvements over
Disney’s productions released during the Second World War, some of these films still
remain problematic. Issues such as the extremely caricatured Native Americans in Peter
Pan (1953), as well as its featured song “What Made the Red Man Red”, still top many
lists of Disney controversies today. Other controversies from the Silver Age can
interestingly enough be found in Disney’s animated animal characters; the antagonistic
Siamese cats in Lady and the Tramp (1955) are clearly built on negative stereotypes about
East Asians, while the monkeys in The Jungle Book (1967) happen to be the only animals
in the film portrayed with African-American accents. Furthermore, the song “I Wan’na
Be Like You”, performed by the orangutan King Louie (voiced by Caucasian American
singer Louis Prima), depicts the monkeys’ wish to become more human – something
many critics have found problematic due to the targeted stereotypical traits the monkeys
possess (see e.g. Giroux, 2010). The Jungle Book was, interestingly enough, the last

3

animated feature film overseen by Walt Disney himself, and his death in 1966 is generally
what marks the beginning of the end of the Silver Age.
However, many of the earlier criticized issues still made it into Disney’s Bronze
Age. Some examples of this are the (again) slanted-eyed Siamese cat in Aristocats (1970)
that plays various instruments with his chopsticks, as well as the clearly Latinostereotyped Chihuahua in Oliver & Company (1988), Ignacio Alonzo Julio Federico de
Tito, who, among other foolish things, steals a car. These stereotyped characters are
arguably added to provide comic relief, and despite the critique, stereotyping through
animals seems to remain a quite popular formula for comedy during the more
contemporary Disney eras as well.
The release of The Little Mermaid in 1989 marks the beginning of the period
generally known as the Disney Renaissance (1989-1999) – one of Disney’s most
financially successful eras of filmmaking. Many of the films released during this era
usually featured non-Western characters or settings, and some have consequently
(although remaining immensely popular) gained a somewhat controversial status. This
period in Disney animation, together with the company’s Post-Renaissance (2000-2008)
and Revival Era (2009-present day), will be the main focus of this thesis. The reception
and criticism of the films released after 1989 will thus be discussed and analyzed in more
detail further on. With this brief historical overview as a foundation, I will now be able
to present the specific scope, aim, and justification for this particular master’s thesis.

1.2 Aims, scope and justification

This study will be a development of my bachelor’s thesis from 2015, which also treated
the portrayal of race and ethnicity in Disney’s films. By analyzing two feature films,
Aladdin (1992) and The Princess and the Frog (2009), I tried to provide a general
overview of Disney’s approach towards race and ethnicity, and discuss whether two
decades worth of animated feature films had brought any change to Disney’s portrayals.
Due to the extent of that particular study, many relevant films released between 1992 and
2009 remained unexamined, and much more could probably have been said about
Disney’s creative choices, especially in terms of authorship and creative or artistic
responsibility. Due to the extent of this master’s thesis, I will now be able to focus on
questions similar to those discussed in my previous study more thoroughly, now with a
4

wider set of materials and resources. Disney has also released new theatrical animated
features since 2015, which will result in a more updated analysis. By examining and
comparing a greater number of films, I hope to provide a more extensive presentation and
discussion regarding the changes in the portrayals of race and ethnicity in Disney’s films,
than was possible in my bachelor’s thesis.
It is fair to say that this topic is quite controversial, and there are many existing
arguments both for and against Disney. Douglas Brode is one of the few scholars who
actually defend Disney, as he, in Multiculturalism and the Mouse: race and sex in Disney
entertainment (2005), in fact, argues that Walt Disney was something of an early advocate
of multicultural values in America. While some might remain somewhat critical of
Brode’s work (see e.g. Giroux, 2010), various scholars have still recognized and praised
Multiculturalism and the Mouse. For instance, Deborah C. Mitchell of Westminster
College comments:
Finally someone has written a defense of Disney – and in an era when it’s
become politically correct to criticize ‘the Mouse’. What a brave thing to
do, and what a beautifully structured defense it is.
(Brode, 2005: back cover blurb)
This comment portrays an opinion sometimes expressed in situations where the theme of
Disney and race is being discussed; the accusations regarding Disney’s racism has gotten
out of hand. According to Brode, contemporary Disney critics tend to over-analyze and
search for issues where none exist, and there generally seems to be a current opinion that
we actually live in a society where it is trendy to criticize huge corporations and find
everything racially offensive. However, one could still easily argue that the critical
analyses of these films are essential in many ways; mainly due to the immense impact the
Walt Disney Company and its films actually might have on our society and our lives. An
example of the degree of influence the Walt Disney Company arguably possess can be
found in Gerard C. Raiti’s article “The Disappearance of Disney Animated Propaganda:
A Globalization Perspective” (2007), in which the earlier mentioned propagandistic
material that Disney produced during the Second World War is discussed. A particular
feature film from this era, Victory Through Air Power, based on the non-fiction book with
the same name, was also released by Disney in 1943. The book, written by Alexander P.
De Seversky, was published six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and focused on
aerial strategies and long-range bombing. Both the book and the film had a huge impact
5

on American society at the time, and Raiti does, in fact, argue that “[i]f it wasn’t for the
US Military, the Walt Disney Company may not exist today; and…if it wasn’t for the
Disney Studios, there may never have been an air strike on Japan” (Raiti, 2007: 157).
This statement shows how influential this enterprise already was more than seventy years
ago. Today the Disney Company is one of the largest producers of media and
entertainment in the world, and it is almost impossible to avoid Disney’s productions
entirely. The impact cinema, media and text have on our realities of the world has been
immensely studied, and the way racial or ethnic minorities are portrayed in popular
animated films will certainly affect children, as well as adults, to some extent, no matter
if they are a part of the minority or the majority (Hurley, 2005). Since Disney is an
“international family entertainment and media enterprise”, and Disney’s films (both its
contemporary productions as well as the old classics) still remain essential parts of many
a childhood, it is fairly easy to argue that the company has played, and will continue to
play, an important role in the shaping of our realities of the world. As a result, The Walt
Disney Company clearly has a significant responsibility; and that is why I personally
believe it is important to discuss what these products really represent.
I would still like to clarify that this particular thesis will solely focus on
representations of race and ethnicity in animated Disney films, and not pay any more
attention to Walt Disney himself or any other non-cinematic branches of the company.
However, due to the massive size of the Walt Disney Company, it is almost impossible
to consider all of its animated products in a study such as this. I will, therefore, only focus
on feature-length films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios – a subdivision of
Walt Disney Studios owned by the Walt Disney Company. A sole focus on Walt Disney
Animation Studios still results in a vast amount of source material, wherefore the films
have had to meet additional criteria before being considered as primary sources. These
criteria, which will be presented and discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.3, leaves us
with the following films; Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Mulan (1998), Lilo &
Stitch (2002), The Princess and the Frog (2009), Big Hero 6 (2014), and Moana (2016).
Through a qualitative analysis and comparison of the chosen films, I hope to clarify the
situation regarding racism and stereotypes in something as culturally central and
seemingly innocent as Disney.

2. Theoretical framework

This chapter will define the scope, methodology, and theory of my thesis in more detail.
The existing material examining Disney’s relation to race and ethnicity will be reviewed,
and my research questions will be presented. By doing this I hope to demonstrate what
we already might know about this topic, and where my research fits into it all. A
significant part of this chapter has also been reserved for reviewing my source material,
in which I will highlight the importance of the films chosen for this study. In addition to
explaining how these seven films were chosen, the way in which this material will be
treated and analyzed will also be established here. A review of relevant concepts and
theory relating to this topic will consequently be provided, and by the end of this chapter,
we will hopefully have all the necessary tools needed for moving on towards the essence
of the thesis.

2.1 Previous research

The most frequent criticisms [of Disney] include sexism, racism,
conservatism, heterosexism, andro-centricism, imperialism (cultural),
imperialism (economic), literary vandalism, jingoism, aberrant sexuality,
censorship, propaganda, paranoia, homophobia, exploitation, ecological
devastation, anti-union repression, FBI collaboration, corporate raiding, and
stereotyping. It would seem only a matter of time before conclusive proof
is discovered linking Walt Disney to the assassination of J. F. Kennedy and
the production of antipersonnel landmines.
(Byrne & McQuillan, 1999: 1)
During the 1970s, criticizing Disney was already, if you will, considered “mainstream”
(Dorfman & Mattelart, 1971). However, Disney; indicating the man, the company and
the films, have not only been a subject of general criticism, but a point of interest in a
great deal of scholarly work as well, and from the 1990s onward, many volumes treating
Disney’s take on diversity have been published – both in favor of and against Disney.
Three of these publications might be quite central in this study; Deconstructing Disney
(Byrne & McQuillan, 1999), Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney
Entertainment (Brode, 2005) and The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of
7

Innocence (Giroux, 2010). These quite prominent volumes, published at least five years
apart from each other, all discuss Disney’s portrayals of race and ethnicity. However,
unlike Brode’s already mentioned work, the two remaining volumes take a more critical
approach towards Disney’s various productions.
Together with volumes such as From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film,
Gender, and Culture (Bell et al., 1995), Deconstructing Disney still remains one of the
frequently quoted critical editions regarding Disney and diversity. While issues such as
gender, sexuality and religion are present throughout the work, the authors have also
dedicated an entire chapter to race and ethnicity. Much of what is said here will most
likely correlate to what is discussed in this thesis, as Byrne and McQuillan mainly
examine Disney films released after 1989. However, with Deconstructing Disney being
published back in 1999, Mulan remains the most recent film discussed in this particular
volume. This is where other articles, as well as Giroux’s work, published over ten years
after Deconstructing Disney, might provide more insight.
While Giroux arguably is most known for his work on critical theory, as well as
critical pedagogy – with the latter focus earning him a chapter in Routledge’s Fifty
Modern Thinkers on Education: From Piaget to the Present (Palmer, 2001) – he is
arguably also one of the most well-known Disney critics of our time. As a result of
Giroux’s general area of focus, The Mouse that Roared mainly focuses on the social
impact of Disney’s productions, rather than providing separate literal analyses of
Disney’s films. Unlike Byrne and McQuillan’s work, Giroux arguments might therefore
be more central in relation to the discussion of the results from the upcoming film
analyses, rather than the analyses themselves.
One could argue that Douglas Brode’s take on Disney is a combination of the two
volumes mentioned above, however based on a counterargument. In Multiculturalism and
the Mouse, Brode argues that Disney actually was one of the first producers of Western
films with fair portrayals of racial minorities. To strengthen his arguments, Brode
analyzes both Disney’s products, as well as the socio-political climate at the time.
However, while Brode’s arguments are interesting, they simultaneously remain
somewhat dubious. Giroux actually criticizes Brode for supporting many of his claims
with quite selective readings of Disney films, and argues the following:
[Brode] claims that the very fact of Disney’s representation of racial
minorities, implied homosexuals, or women (regardless of whether the
characters are construed as positive or negative or the politics of
8

representation is actually suppressed) makes Disney’s politics laudatory for
promoting multicultural diversity.
(Giroux, 2010: 241)
Furthermore, Brode barely discusses Disney films produced after 1989 – even though
Multiculturalism and the Mouse was published as late as in 2005. While all this might
result in Brode’s work being irrelevant for this particular study, it is simultaneously what
makes Multiculturalism and the Mouse somewhat central to my thesis. The decision to
focus on films released after 1989 is, in fact, partially based on the absence of these films
in Brode’s analysis, and it could be argued that this thesis, in a way, “picks up where
Brode left off”. To take some of Brode’s arguments regarding the films released prior to
1989, and apply them to the more contemporary films analyzed in this study, might also
bring some interesting perspectives to the discussion.
Nevertheless, due to the time of publishing, none of these works treat any of the
films from Disney’s Revival Era (2009-present day) – and it is here I really hope to
provide something new to the field. Similar arguments and criticism as provided by the
earlier mentioned scholars can be applied to the more recent films, and change or
progression might, as a result, be determined. Additionally, none of the volumes above
review the overall change of Disney’s portrayal of race and ethnicity in a similar manner.
A final volume quite central to this study is Janet Wasko’s Understanding Disney
(2001). Unlike the previous three volumes, Wasko’s work does not include specific
analyses of Disney’s films, but rather tries to generally explain “everything Disney”.
Everything from the history and the structure of the company, to the typical formula for
an animated Disney feature film is described here, and Wasko’s work will thus be a useful
point of reference as I try to explain how and why the portrayals of race and ethnicity in
Disney’s films have changed over time.

2.2 Research questions and hypothesis

While the topic for this thesis already might have been defined, the research questions for
the study have still not been presented. These questions have been designed to narrow my
scope, and will establish the aims and limitations for this thesis even further. The main
research question for this study simply reads as follows:
9

1) Based on the analyses of seven films released between 1992 and 2016, how has
Walt Disney Animation Studios’ portrayal of race and ethnicity changed over
time?
As already mentioned, due to the extent and variation of Disney’s productions, I will only
focus on animated feature films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. For reasons
already stated, I have decided to focus on films released after the beginning of the period
generally known as the Disney Renaissance (beginning with the release of The Little
Mermaid in 1989) – which gives me about 30 years’ worth of Disney productions to
analyze. Be that as it may, seven feature films is still a more suitable amount of material
for this particular study, and the discussion regarding change in Disney’s ethnic and racial
portrayals will therefore be based on the analyses of the seven earlier listed feature films.
However, to specify what the analyses of these films will focus on, an additional question
have to be asked.
2) How does Walt Disney Animation Studios portray racial and ethnic minorities in
Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, The Princess and the Frog, Big
Hero 6 and Moana?
As this thesis clearly is written from a Western perspective, “racial and ethnic minorities”
refers to racial and ethnic groups regarded as minorities in Western contemporary society.
This is, however, still a somewhat complex concept that will be discussed further in
chapter 2.4.2. Furthermore, the focus will not only be on the minority characters
themselves, but also their distinct cultures represented by Disney – since this combination
really might give the film audiences an image of the minority in general. To call this
research question secondary would not be quite fair, since it clearly will cover an
important part of this study. By applying this question to the analysis of the seven films,
the relevant issues will hopefully be highlighted, and the results from the analyses can
consequently be used to discuss the primary research question. These analyses will be
based on existing literary theory, as well as supported by earlier research and criticism,
such as the material discussed earlier in this chapter.
A general hypothesis for this study could be based on the results found in my
bachelor’s thesis from 2015. Based on the results found there, it appears as if Disney
generally is becoming less offensive and more culturally sensitive with time. As of late,
Disney has clearly taken certain measures to provide positive representations of foreign
cultures and minorities (Anjirbag, 2018); focus groups representing the people portrayed
10

through animation have been consulted for several productions, and the creative minds
behind the films usually spend some time in the country or the culture where the film will
take place. Still, these measures have sometimes not been enough. While the straightforward racism, (present in some of the earliest Disney films) might have disappeared,
many supposedly subconscious choices made by Disney could still be regarded as
problematic. However, the two Disney films examined in my bachelor’s thesis were
partially chosen based on the vast amount of criticism they had been exposed to. With a
focus on a greater number of Disney films, with varying amounts of relevant criticism, it
will hopefully become clear whether this hypothesis holds up.

2.3 Source material

Before moving on to the introduction and general overview of the films analyzed in this
study, I will first discuss the process of choosing these particular films. Excluding
material in a study such as this might be quite dangerous, as some choices might lead to
somewhat selective results – which possibly has been the case with Brode’s earlier
mentioned work. The animated feature films included in this analysis have therefore been
carefully chosen based on the following pre-established criteria.
1) The feature film has been released by Walt Disney Animation Studios sometime
between 1989 and 2016.
To be able analyze Walt Disney Animation Studios’ more contemporary approach
towards race and ethnicity, I will clearly have to focus on films that have been released
more recently. This criterion leaves us with 29 feature films, and to be able to narrow the
scope even further, the films included in this study still have to meet a few additional
requirements.
Based on the justification for my thesis, I want to focus on films that people from
all over the world actually have seen. Disney could produce the most diverse and
culturally sensitive film ever made – but would it matter if no one saw it? The second
requirement consequently relates to popularity – a quite difficult concept, to which a
subjective view really cannot be applied. However, a film with a great worldwide revenue
could possibly be seen as a popular production; people have paid to see the film,
merchandise has been sold, and people have generally been exposed to the feature and
11

what it might represent. Unfortunately, statistics like this are quite difficult to find, and
the only numbers generally found are those of box-office revenue. This is a somewhat
unreliable trait in this case, since there are many Hollywood blockbusters with a high
box-office revenue that still have been poorly received. These “bad” films are usually not
being watched over and over again, and they might just become “forgotten”. This is why
another element regarding popularity has to be considered – the ratings. There are many
mediums and platforms for rating films – however, one of the most popular platforms
today is the Internet Movie Database, IMDB, and it is here we turn for additional data.
Unlike platforms such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB’s ratings come solely from its users,
which makes it more relevant for this particular criterion. A film with a high rating from
general audiences, combined with an initial high worldwide-revenue, will arguably be
remembered, as well as revisited many times. To determine popularity, we therefore apply
these criteria to the remaining Disney films:
2) The film’s worldwide box-office revenue exceeds 314 million (inflation adjusted)
US dollars.
3) The film has a current (2018) rating of 7.1 or higher on IMDB.
The particular sum of 314 million US dollars, as well as the IMDB rating of 7.1, is based
on the popularity of The Princess and the Frog. With mixed reviews and a somewhat
mediocre worldwide revenue of 314 million dollars, the release of this film still marks
the beginning of the period known as Disney’s Revival Era. The introduction of Tiana as
Disney’s first African-American princess resulted in the film gaining presence in media
already prior to its release, and the impact of this film can still be seen in popular culture
and Disney’s general branding. Based on the popularity of The Princess and the Frog in
relation to its average worldwide revenue and rating, this film could arguably set the limit
for what a popular Disney production is.
14 films passed the three requirements described above, and can now be
considered in terms of the fourth, and most important, criterion:
4) The film features either a foreign or alien setting (that is based on a real culture or
demographic), or central characters that belong to a racial or ethnic minority.
This criterion really relates to the essence of this thesis – as it, clearly, is the representation
of these characters and their cultures that will be analyzed. While the minority, the
foreign, and “the other” will be the focus of this study, a certain comparison between
Western and non-Western settings and characters will surely find its way into the analysis.
12

It is, however, important to clarify that films set in the West, with Western non-minority
characters, such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) or Frozen (2013), generally will remain
unexamined, even though they did pass the three first requirements. As a result, we are
now left with ten relevant, arguably popular, contemporary animated feature films; all
presented in the table below.

As one might notice, some films may appear more relevant than others, and a few
additional films will therefore be excluded. These final exclusions are based on the film’s
relevance, as well as its year of release. To be able to discuss and determine change in
Disney’s portrayals of race and ethnicity as efficiently as possible, the films included in
the analysis should be released over the widest possible period. The final criterion
therefore reads as follows:
5) The films have been released at least two years apart from each other.
This final requirement leaves us with the seven animated films already listed earlier in
this thesis. A few decisions still had to be made when applying this final criterion. For
instance, the decision to exclude both Hercules and Tarzan, rather than just Mulan, was
made on the amount of relevant data present in the films. While the African Americanportrayed muses in Hercules generally were received positively by audiences, their minor
presence in the feature does still not necessarily justify a qualitative analysis of the entire
film – at least not when the data is compared to what possibly can be found in Mulan.
Nevertheless, this does not mean that the minority representations found in the excluded
feature films will be ignored entirely. If relevant issue appears in one of the chosen films,
it might be useful to draw examples from other relevant films as well. Some of the
excluded material could thus still be regarded as secondary sources for this study.

13

There is much to be said about the films chosen for this study, and to briefly
introduce their characters, settings, and plots is no easy task. A general synopsis is,
however, still quite necessary, and the films are consequently, however briefly, presented
in the following subchapters. Relevant characters, scenes, and plot points will, of course,
be discussed further in the analysis itself.
2.3.1 The Disney Renaissance
The Disney Renaissance is, as already mentioned, one of the most successful eras of
Disney animation; even though the animation process generally got more expensive, the
films themselves generated more profits than ever. The love for the films released during
this period eventually turned some of these productions into Broadway musicals, and
many of these Renaissance animations have already been (or are currently being)
developed into live-action feature films by Walt Disney Studios. These films do, in other
words, still remain quite relevant – even though they were released in the past millennium.
The majority of Disney’s Renaissance-films also feature non-Western settings and
characters, and three of the films included in this study are, not surprisingly, found here.
The list of relevant films begins with Aladdin – an Academy Award-winning boxoffice success, with its plot and characters loosely based on one of the most well-known
stories included in The Thousand and One Nights. This film, directed by Ron Clements
and John Musker, is set in the fictional and mystical city of Agrabah at an unspecified
time in history, and follows the story of the orphan Aladdin who comes across a magical
lamp that contains a genie. The genie grants Aladdin three wishes and the orphan boy
consequently begins his pursuit to change his life to win the heart of princess Jasmine.
Although being an instant success, Aladdin also received a lot of criticism from its
audiences, including the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (Breaux, 2010).
Many issues regarding Disney’s portrayal of the Middle East were regarded as inaccurate
and misrepresenting, and with the combination of the film’s post-Gulf War and orientalist
clichés, Aladdin eventually came to be regarded as one of the most controversial films of
all time (King, 2010).
Walt Disney Animation Studios’ following feature film, The Lion King, was
released two years after Aladdin, and could arguably be seen as Disney’s most popular
film to date. This feature animation, directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, focuses
on the life and journey of the lion Simba – the heir to the throne of the Pride Lands (based
14

on the African savannah). The events of The Lion King are arguably loosely based on
Shakespeare’s Hamlet, with the evil uncle Scar murdering Simba’s father and usurping
the throne. As a result, Simba has to flee, before eventually returning as a fully-grown
lion, to take his rightful place as king. While a film featuring only animals might have
felt like a safer choice than a film portraying a “real culture” and its people, The Lion
King still received its fair share of criticism. Some critics and scholars have, for instance,
criticized the lazy, freeloading, antagonistic hyenas for having “jive accents of decidedly
urban black or Hispanic youth” (Giroux, 2010: 110). Nevertheless, this particular film is
still fondly remembered, with, for instance, its Broadway adaptation being the thirdlongest-running Broadway musical of all time (The Broadway League, 2018).
Four years pass before the following film included in this study, Mulan, was
released. In 1998, after films set in Pre-Colonial America, Medieval France, and Ancient
Greece, Disney decided to release its first animated film set in China. This film (directed
by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft) features Disney’s second non-white female
protagonist (after Pocahontas) – a warrior woman with the same name as the film title.
The story of Mulan takes place sometime during the Northern and Southern dynasties of
China (420-589 A.D.), and is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan. In the film
adaptation, Mulan steals her father’s armor and enlists in the Imperial army, disguised as
a man. After immense training, as well as moral and tactical support from her dragoncompanion Mushu, Mulan becomes a soldier, is sent into battle, and eventually (almost
single-handedly) leads China to victory in the war against the Huns. While Mulan is one
of the less criticized films included in this study, with many actually praising the film for
being both feminist and progressive, the film was, interestingly enough, still not very
popular in China (Ward, 2002). This particular reception and criticism will clearly be
further discussed in relation to the main analysis of the film.
2.3.2 The Disney Post-Renaissance
Another four years pass, the Disney Renaissance ends, and a number of less successful
feature films are released before Disney’s 2002-feature Lilo & Stitch makes it to the silver
screen. Disney’s Post-Renaissance was clearly not as successful as its previous era, which
can be seen based on the fact that Lilo & Stitch is the only film from this period to pass
the earlier described popularity criteria. The film’s popularity is, nonetheless, further
established by the fact that it is the only Post-Renaissance film (yet) planned to get its
15

own live-action/CG adaptation in the near future (McNary, 2018). In this particular story,
Lilo – a somewhat misunderstood and lonely orphan – befriends the creature Stitch – an
alien experiment mistaken for a dog who eventually gets adopted by Lilo and her sister.
With most of its events taking place on the island of Kauai, Lilo & Stitch is one of the
few films from the Post-Renaissance to actually be set in a non-Western environment. It
is unclear if Disney’s choice to revisit exotic cultures was the reason for the film’s
success, but this fact does, nevertheless, make this feature quite relevant for this study.
Interestingly enough, Lilo & Stitch is directed by Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois – two
of the people most involved in the story-writing on Mulan – and similarly to Mulan, this
particular feature have not been as criticized as Aladdin or The Lion King. Even in
comparison with Moana (also set in Polynesia, but released over a decade later), Lilo &
Stitch could possibly be regarded as the more progressive and culturally sensitive film, as
it generally seems to have received more praise for its portrayal of Polynesian culture and
people than Moana. All this might lead to a quite interesting comparison between Lilo &
Stitch and the other films included in the analysis, as one could ask oneself if this film
actually is more progressive and culturally sensitive than the other entries on the list. Are
certain creative minds simply more considerate in terms of ethnic and racial
representation, or is the positive criticism of Lilo & Stitch a result of other factors?
2.3.3 The Disney Revival Era
As the generally given name of this particular period might demonstrate, the Revival Era
brought back much of Disney’s former glory – beginning with the release of The Princess
and the Frog. This is the fifth Disney film directed by Musker and Clements, and while
the popularity surrounding this production and its role in the revival of Disney animation
might already have been discussed, the plot of the film has still not been introduced. The
Princess and the Frog centers on Tiana, the African-American protagonist of the story,
who, after kissing a frog, accidentally turns into a frog herself. The transformation of
Tiana takes her and the frog-prince Naveen on a journey through the Louisiana bayou,
where they encounter new companions as they are searching for a way to break the frogcurse, put on by the evil voodoo witch Dr. Facilier (who turned Prince Naveen into a frog
in the first place). To make Disney’s first African-American princess narrative as
progressive and free from racial bias as possible, Disney actually worked with various

16

African-American focus groups (McCoy Gregory, 2010). However, despite their efforts,
the film still received a great deal of criticism, further explored in chapter 3.5.
After a number of successful titles following The Princess and the Frog, Big Hero
6 was released. This film, directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, was even more
successful than some of its Disney Revival predecessors, and does, in fact, differ a great
deal from the typical Disney films. Based on the Marvel comic book with the same name,
Big Hero 6 is actually Disney’s first take on the superhero-narrative. The story focuses
on the 14-year-old mixed-race protagonist Hiro Hamada and his healthcare robot
Baymax. After the death of Hiro’s brother Tadashi (the creator of Baymax), the
protagonist eventually forms a team of superheroes, consisting of himself, Baymax and
Tadashi’s former friends from the university – all in order to solve the mystery of his
brother’s death. The film is also, interestingly enough, set in the fictional city of San
Fransokyo – a fictional hybrid city combining characteristics from both San Francisco
and Tokyo. Big Hero 6 actually received a great deal of praise for its multicultural setting,
and the film was generally received well by its audiences. The multiculturalism of this
film will be an interesting area of focus, especially when compared to Disney’s portrayal
of Asian culture in Mulan, or Disney’s other, already mentioned, fictional city Agrabah.
Moana is Disney’s most recent film included in this study – and can actually be
linked to many of the other entries. This is one of the three films of focus that have been
directed by Disney veterans Musker and Clements. Furthermore, it was co-directed by
Hall and Williams, the directors of Big Hero 6. It can even be linked to the only PostRenaissance film in this study, as it shares some of its setting with Lilo & Stitch. Both
films take place in what could be considered as Polynesia, but while Lilo & Stitch clearly
is set in contemporary Hawaii, the fictional events of Moana takes place about 2000 years
ago. The story centers on Moana – an islander (and the daughter of the village chief) eager
to explore the seas and see more of the world. When her village begins to struggle to
survive on their dying island, Moana ventures out to see to seek the help of the demi-god
Maui, and together they embark on a journey similar to the one found in The Princess
and the Frog. Similarly to that film, Disney’s production of Moana was influenced by
relevant focus groups. Nevertheless, while receiving less criticism than The Princess and
the Frog, Moana has still been the center of some controversy – for instance regarding
the representation of Maui as an overweight, lazy man, rather than a slim, heroic demigod.

2.4 Concepts and theory

We now know what material this study is going to focus on. We have familiarized
ourselves with the earlier research, and we know where this study fits into it all. The
research questions have been established, and we are almost ready to begin the analysis.
However, we still have to discuss the theory and concepts relevant for this study. The
frequently mentioned terms Disney, race, ethnicity, and minority have to be defined in
more detail, and while it has been established that a qualitative analysis of the seven
chosen films is required in order to answer the main research question of this thesis, the
specific theory essential for the analysis has still not been established. As we are dealing
with portrayals of race and ethnicity in Western film, significant theories such as
imagology, postcolonialism, and disneyfication consequently require revision and
discussion in the following subchapters.
2.4.1 Disney
The term Disney has, as mentioned, been frequently used in this study, usually as an
umbrella term for the company, the studio, the producers, the directors, and everyone else
involved with the material of focus in this study. Disney has, thus, so far, been more or
less regarded as the author of this particular source material. However, when focusing on
how the portrayals of race and ethnicity in these films have changed over time, it would
be somewhat unreliable to simply regard Disney (as a whole) as the creative force behind
the film, since it is possible that certain stereotyping (or progressive cultural sensitivity)
could be more frequent with, for example, a certain director. Had this study focused on a
novel, a poem, or any literary work by a specific author, it would have been fairly easy to
link the creative choices found in the literary work to the aforementioned author. It is
quite clear that this issue becomes more complicated with (Disney) films, due to the vast
amount of people it takes to actually make an animated feature film.
While the director sometimes can be seen as the author of the film (see e.g. Auteur
theory), it is still quite difficult to argue that an animated Disney feature film is the result
of a single creative mind. As many of the films chosen for this study also have different
directors, an analysis completely reliant on the premises of Auteur theory would not work,
as we are trying to determine whether (all) the films produced by Walt Disney Animation
18

Studios (irrespective to the films’ directors) are becoming more progressive and culturally
sensitive. The term Disney will therefore, generally and continuously be used as an
umbrella term for everything closely associated with the authorship of the films chosen
for this study. When referring to Disney’s approach towards race and ethnicity in this
thesis, we consequently refer to the approach of all these creative minds behind the
specific Disney films. Nevertheless, a specific chapter will be reserved for analyzing and
discussing the directors’ impacts on the films, as well as the division of the artistic and
creative responsibility between the filmmakers and the studio.
2.4.2 Race, ethnicity, and minority
While terms such as race, ethnicity, diversity, multiculturalism, and minority generally
might be familiar to many, a few of these specific concepts will still need to be clarified
before moving on with the study, as to avoid confusion and ambiguity.
Race is probably one of the more complicated words present in this study, mainly
due to its somewhat controversial, complex and ever-changing meanings. Starting out as
a denominator for people from distinct families and heritage, race went on to refer to
people from different cultures and nations, before it eventually became a categorical term
for the division of people based on their physical traits. In the beginning of the nineteenth
Century, Georges Cuvier hierarchically divided humanity into three separate varieties;
Caucasian, Ethiopian and Mongolian (basically white, black and yellow). With their
physical differences as foundation, Cuvier argued Caucasians to be superior to the other
races – an argument that has been used to justify many injustices ever since (Derksen,
2007). Thankfully, this is clearly not the general or scientific consensus today, and race
is no longer treated as a biological concept – at least not in that sense. Today, the word
race has gained a more social and subjective meaning , with the word now referring to
“[a]n ethnic group, regarded as showing a common origin and descent; a tribe, nation, or
people, regarded as of common stock” (The Oxford English Dictionary, 2008).
This brings us to the term ethnicity. The OED describes ethnicity as “[s]tatus in
respect of membership of a group regarded as ultimately of common descent, or having
a common national or cultural tradition; ethnic character” (The Oxford English
Dictionary, 2014). This might resemble the earlier mentioned definition of race, and the
words could, in this sense, be regarded as synonyms. Nevertheless, race generally refers
to what can be determined based on physical traits, while ethnicity is determined based
19

on cultural factors, such as religion, nationality or language. Based on this definition, a
person could arguably belong to several ethnic groups, while one usually is regarded as
belonging to one race (or being mixed-race).
However, the meanings and definitions of these words might still overlap,
especially since the definition of race to this day generally remains somewhat ambiguous.
An example of this ambiguity can be found in the United States Decennial Census, in
which the US population has been divided into different races for statistical purposes.

This quite simplistic division has been present, although updated, since 1790, and the
approach has received some criticism (see e.g. Snipp, 2003). The US Census Bureau’s
decision to exclude Hispanic and Latino as alternatives for race (and rather presents the
additional question “Are you of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin?”) have, for example,
raised some questions (López, 2018). Simultaneously, other informative sources, such as
Encyclopædia Britannica, lists, for instance, African Americans as an “ethnic group”
(Lynch, 2019), rather than a racial group. Due to this ambiguity, I have chosen to treat
the concept of race in a similar manner as described in The National Research Council’s
Measuring Racial Discrimination (2004), in which they state the following:
There is no single concept of race. Rather, race is a complex concept, best
viewed for social science purposes as a subjective social construct based on
observed or ascribed characteristics that have acquired socially significant
meaning.
(The National Research Council, 2004: 38)
Nevertheless, to ignore or favor either the term race or ethnicity in this study might not
lead to a meaningful analysis. Whether Aladdin is Middle Eastern in terms of race or
ethnicity does not necessarily matter for this particular study, and as there clearly are
20

various interpretations of the words, I have decided to treat them (more or less) as a unity
– keeping in mind the earlier mentioned general lines of race being a question of physical
traits, and ethnicity being a question of culture. This study does, in other words, not focus
on solely racial nor solely ethnic minorities, but both terms are included as to not leave
out any specific minority of importance.
When determining what a racial or ethnic minority in the Western world is, one
could use the statistics by the United States Census Bureau here listed in Table 2 as a
reference. With “White” constituting about to thirds of the US population, one could
clearly regard the other races as minorities. While it might be a bit dubious to refer to
these minorities as minorities in the Western World, as the statistics only refer to the
United States, these demographics could arguably still be regarded as minorities in
Europe and Australia as well. The same is true for all the characters analyzed in this study.
While, for example, the character Belle from Beauty and the Beast (set in France) could
be regarded as belonging to an ethnic minority if she had lived in the United States, she
does still not belong to a minority when looking at the entire Western world – and this
particular type of character is therefore, as earlier established, not included in this study.
2.4.3 Imagology
“The tendency to attribute specific characteristics or even characters to different societies,
races or ‘nations’ is very old and very widespread” (Leersen, 2007). The study of the
constructed representations of national characters in literature – here defined as
imagology – has, however, not been around for that long. While the early studies of
national characters and characteristics generally focused on proving that certain behavior
and ideologies were linked to a certain race or nationality, the modern imagology is
arguably doing the opposite. After the Second World War, a new interest was put on the
perception of national characters and characteristics, the concept of stereotypes gained
more attention, and imagology eventually emerged. While imagology found its ground in
comparative literature, it has since then become something of an interdisciplinary study,
with strong links to social sciences (Chew, 2006). Imagology will, likewise be applied to
the analyses found in this study.
Manfred Beller and Joep Leerssen’s Imagology: The cultural construction and
literary representation of national characters: A critical survey was published in 2007,
and contains various articles and on the subject of imagology. This volume will hopefully
21

prove itself quite useful in the upcoming analysis, as it also contains surveys on
stereotypes and characteristics usually ascribed to specific ethnicities and nationalities.
To alone determine whether or not something is a stereotype might be a quite subjective
task, and Beller and Leerssen’s work might provide the objectivity required for this part
of the study. By referring to these surveys and articles, written by various scholars with
varying national and ethnic backgrounds, it will hopefully be possible to demonstrate
whether the issues present in the analyzed films feed into certain common stereotypical
views.
2.4.4 Postcolonialism and orientalism
Ever since there have been Western colonizers and colonies, there have also been Western
texts about these colonies and their inhabitants. Most of these texts have been written by
the colonizers – about the colonized. As the name suggests, postcolonialism deals with
what comes after the colonization. By highlighting the separate meanings of “postcolonialism” and “postcolonialism”, Camelia Elias (The Way of the Sign, 2011) critically
defines this concept even further. While the aftermath, the effects and the products of
imperialism and colonization have been the focus for post-colonial criticism, it is the
representations of people and cultures before colonization, during colonization, and after
colonization that is important in postcolonial criticism (Elias, 2011). Postcolonial literary
criticism regards the Western texts about the colonies as unreliable narratives, and brings
attention to the value of colonized peoples’ own representations of themselves and their
cultures. As all films included in this study could arguably be seen as set in areas affected
by the British Empire, and with Disney being the huge Western company it is today,
postcolonialism will clearly remain central in this study.
A reoccurring term in discourse relating to postcolonial criticism and theory is
orientalism. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term “orientalism”
generally referred to the study of Asian or Eastern cultures. By the end of the twentieth
century, however, “Asian studies” had almost entirely replaced the earlier term – probably
as a direct result of the Palestinian American scholar Edward Said, and the publishing of
his work Orientalism in 1978 (Thomas, 2014). Here, Said uses the term orientalism to
refer to the Western interpretation of “the orient”, rather than the studies about it.

22

“Orientalism can be discussed and analyzed as the corporate institution for
dealing with the Orient – dealing with it by making statements about it,
authorizing views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling over
it: in short, Orientalism as a Western style for dominating, restructuring and
having authority over the Orient.”
(Said, 1978: 3)
The biased representation of the East, described in Orientalism, is usually based on
stereotypes and prejudice; it is patronizing, fictional, and supports the notion of cultural
imperialism, as well as the Western colonial policy. According to Said, this form of
orientalism has been present ever since the eighteenth century and the colonialization of
the Middle East. Besides bringing more focus to “the orient” and the Islamic world,
Edward Said also emphasized and defined the notion of the other – i.e. the binary
relationship between us and them, (here) created by the colonizers and the West – which
has remained quite central in much of the post-colonial literature. This type of orientalism,
with a special focus on the concept of “othering”, will be examined further in relation to
the films chosen for this study.
2.4.5 Disneyfication
Disneyfication is, as mentioned, another concept central to this thesis. With the large
number of studies made on Disney in various fields, disneyfication has become something
of a loose term. A quick online search usually gives us the sociology-related definition of
disneyfication; a transformation of a society into something that could resemble a Disney
theme park, all relating to Western-globalization, consumerism and merchandizing. The
Merriam-Webster dictionary defines disneyfication as “the transformation (as of
something real or unsettling) into carefully controlled and safe entertainment or an
environment with similar qualities” (Merriam-Webster Inc., 2019). This definition does
not only fit in the field of sociology, but in literary criticism as well.
In Understanding Disney (2001), Janet Wasko discusses how Disney, since the
very beginning, have disneyfied the folk- and fairytales and used them as source material
for their films. Wasko argues that the disneyfication-process includes “sanitization and
Americanization” (2001: 113), or westernization; the source material is, in other words,
rewritten so it is better suited for young American (or Western) audiences. While this
might seem like a logical and profitable decision on Disney’s part (with young Americans
23

as their main audience), this has many times also resulted in a backlash from the real
population that these stories originally belong to, as the process of disneyfication often
change, simplify or westernize quite important aspects of the source material. The source
material is often turned into what Wasko presents as the classic Disney film, which she
describes with the following formula:

As all films but one (Lilo & Stitch) are based on source material not written by the
filmmakers, it will be interesting to see whether these characteristics appear in the
different films, and how they have affected the reception of the feature itself.

3. Results

As the theoretical framework has been established, it is now time for the main part of this
thesis. This chapter is reserved for the analyses of the films chosen for this study. The
seven films will, as mentioned, be analyzed with a focus on imagology, postcolonialism,
and disneyfication, as well as the reviews and the criticism these films have received in
general. The results will be presented separately, in a chronological order based on the
feature films’ year of release. While some comparison between the films naturally will
occur here, the real question of change will, however, be the focus of Chapter 4.

3.1 Aladdin

“Unconscious racism is still alive and well in Hollywood”; so argues Jack Shaheen in the
1993 article “Aladdin: Animated Racism” (1993: 49). Although the degree of Disney’s
unconsciousness could be questioned, racism, irrespective to its nature, clearly remains
relevant in relation to the animated feature film Aladdin.
3.1.1 The Disney Orient
One does not have to wait long before the problematic issues start to arise in Walt Disney
Animation Studios’ 31st feature film, as its opening song “Arabian Nights”, sung by a
merchant riding a camel through the desert, quickly became a topic of controversy. In the
original version of the film, the song started with the following lines:
Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home
(Aladdin, 1992)
It is not difficult to understand that “Arabian Nights” offended and agitated many, as it,
as Shaheen puts it, “slandered the heritage of 300 million Arabs” (1993: 49). The
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee asked for the removal of the song, and
25

the line “Where they cut off your ear / if they don't like your face” was consequently
changed to “Where it’s flat and immense/ and the heat is intense” for the home-video
versions of the film (Giroux, 2010). Nevertheless, even with this change of lyrics,
“Arabian Nights” still introduces Aladdin’s audience to a strange, mystical and somewhat
barbaric setting.
This particular introduction is arguably a text-book example of Said’s (1978)
notion of orientalism. The earlier mentioned merchant sings about the desert and flying
carpets, and greets the viewers with the lines “Ah, Salaam and good evening to you
worthy friend. […] Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest
merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today” (Aladdin, 1992). This,
apparently, is Disney’s orient; a combination of elements found in old Arabian folktales,
and Western stereotypes of the Arabs as greedy merchants with “the finest merchandise”,
which here breaks as soon as the merchant touches it. These merchants really have a
presence throughout the film, and can usually be seen or heard somewhere in the
background, selling, for example, dates and figs – but the instances of Western
orientalism do not stop here. The film feature many exotic animals (usually pets, like the
monkey Abu, the tiger Rajah, and the parrot Iago), and the streets of Agrabah are filled
with sword swallowers, fire breathers, and belly dancers. Furthermore, even some of the
more orientalist elements central to the story, such as the flying carpet, are, in fact
introduced solely by Disney, and do not exist in the original version found in The
Thousand and One Nights. Traces of orientalism can also be seen through the character
designs, especially if one focuses on the “exotic” clothing of the Princess Jasmine. While
most of the female characters in the film do not speak, and often only appear in the
background, one can still see that they all usually dress according to Islamic fashion, for
example by wearing a headdress. Jasmine, on the other hand, does not wear a headdress
and her clothes are, in fact, quite revealing. Lacroix (2004) believes this to be an example
of the orientalization of Middle Eastern women (discussed by Said), and argues that
Jasmine’s costume “plays into Western cultural notions of the Orient through the
referencing of the imagery of the harem and the associated exotic, sexual stereotypes”
(2004: 221). One might argue that Jasmine looks nothing like a Middle Eastern Islamic
princess, and more like one of the harem girls that also resides in the city of Agrabah.
While Disney’s orientalist representation of the Middle East can be questioned, it
is also important to point out that Agrabah is a fictional city. One could therefore argue
that Disney represents a fairytale orient, rather than the real Middle East. This argument
26

still becomes somewhat dubious, due to the narrative structure of Aladdin. The story of
Aladdin is presented by the narrator – the merchant – as something that happened long
ago. However, he simultaneously enters Agrabah on camelback before he begins his
story. In other words, while the story of Aladdin alone might be a legend, the city of
Agrabah is, in this film, a real place. More links to the “real world”, which simultaneously
makes Agrabah more “real”, can also be seen during Aladdin and Jasmine’s magic carpet
ride, as they pass historic landmarks, such as the sphinx and the Forbidden City. The
orientalist Agrabah might, consequently, be considered by some as a truthful
representation of the Middle East. This argument is further strengthened by the fact that
Aladdin originally was supposed to be set in Baghdad. The setting was, however, changed
due to the ongoing conflicts in the Gulf War between the United States and Iraq
(Waxman, 2019).
3.1.2 The Disney Arab
While the barbaric setting of Aladdin raised some questions, many also reacted strongly
to the unsympathetic and harsh nature of many of the Arab characters in the film (see e.g.
Shaheen, 1993), such as the various merchants and the sultan’s guards. While the
audiences might feel sorry for Aladdin and the other homeless and hungry children that
live on the streets of Agrabah, the merchants and the guards show no sympathy towards
these poor characters at all. The guards draw their swords and chase Aladdin all over the
city – all because he stole a loaf of bread. Further on in the film, they even laugh and
seem to enjoy themselves as they try to kill Aladdin on the orders of the main antagonist,
Jafar. In one particular scene, a merchant even goes as far as to try to cut off Jasmine’s
hand when she takes an apple and gives it to a hungry boy; another scene that many critics
have objected to (James, 2009). As Shaheen, who criticizes Disney for ignoring the
Islamic values relating to compassion, again puts it: “What will children reason about
Islam, a religion embraced by more than 1 billion people, on hearing a street vendor insist
that the standard penalty for stealing is chopping off one's hand?” (1993: 49). Most of the
additional characters featured in Aladdin (with the exception of the protagonist and his
friends) possess these unsympathetic attributes, and seem like the kind of people one does
not want to meet in reality. Additionally, the remaining characters with speaking parts are
mostly thieves or harem girls. This truly makes the community of Agrabah, and perhaps
metonymically the whole Middle East, look like a barbaric wasteland.
27

Nevertheless, Aladdin and his friends are clearly, as mentioned, portrayed in a
more sympathetic manner. This is quite interesting due to the fact that Aladdin, Jasmine,
and the Sultan all belong to the same demographic as the one described above. However,
while one could argue that the protagonist is portrayed as a “good Arab”, it is still
somewhat misleading as Aladdin, in fact, appears more American than Arab. While the
“bad” characters in Aladdin are portrayed with caricaturized features, such as dark beards,
big noses, thick accents and slightly darker skin, Aladdin is a clean-shaven adolescent
with Caucasian physical attributes and a distinct American accent. The other “good” main
characters share many of Aladdin’s features as well, and these “black-and-white”
portrayals have, not surprisingly, received a great deal of criticism.
The Middle Eastern characters’ approach towards religion is another matter of
interest. As Di Giovanni (2014) points out, Disney usually uses different linguistic aids
to reinforce the feeling of the distant culture represented in their films, and familiar
western expressions included in Aladdin have consequently been transformed to support
the setting of this narrative; for instance the expression “God forbid” has been
transformed into “Allah forbid”. Yet, expressions such as “by Allah” and “praise Allah”
are never used by Aladdin or Jasmine. Aladdin’s protagonists are, in other words, never
associated with Islam, and “Muslim” is probably not the first word that comes to mind if
a viewer is asked to describe the hero or the heroine of the story. Disney has clearly
westernized (or disneyfied) its protagonists to make them more appealing to Western
audiences, but by portraying the remaining characters as thieves and barbarians, Disney
has created a clear polarization that reinforces the negative stereotypes of Arabs – and
simultaneously makes the Arab “the other”.
Nevertheless, while the antagonist Jafar, per definition, is considered to be one of
the “bad Arabs”, there is still a few interesting differences between him and the rest of
the barbaric population of Agrabah. Even though Jafar is bearded, wears a turban and,
like the other minor antagonists, have a slightly darker skin-color, this evil sorcerer does
not possess a Middle Eastern accent, but speaks with a distinct British accent. While
keeping the earlier arguments of making someone (or something) “the other” in mind,
one might wonder why Disney decided not to give this antagonist a Middle Eastern
accent. Interestingly enough, many have argued (see e.g. Mitchell-Smith, 2012: 218) that
Disney often uses the standard British accent to indicate intelligence or authority. Jafar is
clearly intelligent; he is a skilled sorcerer and knows a great deal about the occult and the
magical lamp. He is also able to brainwash and control the Sultan through magic, which
28

again gives him some kind of authority. It could, in other words, be possible that Disney
saw it unsuitable to give Jafar a Middle Eastern accent, due to his intelligence and
authority; these attributes had to be associated with something more familiar, such as a
British accent. The notion of the British villain is, however, quite common in American
film, and Disney might simply be following the standard Hollywood practice by making
Jafar British. Whatever the case may be, the Middle Eastern accent in Aladdin still
remains associated with poverty, stupidity, and barbaric behavior.

3.2 The Lion King

The Lion King was, as mentioned, the following film released by Walt Disney Animation
Studios after Aladdin. With directors Allers and Minkoff, Disney created the arguably
most successful hand-drawn animated feature film of all time – but The Lion King is, as
mentioned, not without its criticism. However, the fact that the criticism mostly focuses
on race and ethnicity is quite interesting due to the fact that the film only portrays animal
characters.
3.2.1 Disney’s Africa
The Lion King begins with a dark screen and faint nature sounds – a red sun rises, and the
film’s opening song “Circle of Life” begins with Zulu chanting. The audience is
immediately provided with images of various animals associated with the African
savannah, as well as shots of real landmarks such as the Victoria Falls and Mount
Kilimanjaro, before the camera finally centers on Pride Rock – the fictional home of the
lions. This colorful setting is quite different from many of the colonial representations of
“the dark continent”, and some (e.g. Towbin et al.) have considered this to be a quite
positive and fair representation of Africa. While this might be somewhat true, one could
also argue that African culture barely has a presence in the film. It is true that Disney use
both Zulu and Swahili for some of the film’s songs, as well as for some of its character
names – but only one character in The Lion King is portrayed with an African accent. The
fact that this character happens to be the eccentric baboon Rafiki is yet another somewhat
problematic issue. Similarly to what happens in Aladdin, the main demographic of the
portrayed setting is, thus, again subjected to othering, and while Rafiki remains one of
29

the “good guys”, he is still described as a “creepy little monkey” and possesses a
somewhat different mindset than the lions. Furthermore, no humans (and therefore no real
Africans) are present in the film, and no links to African history are ever provided. In
other words, the events of The Lion King could actually take place in a world where no
Africans, or any humans exist (be that in the past, in the future, or in an alternate universe).
There are varying opinions regarding this representation of Africa; Gooding-Williams
(1995), for example, argues that Disney’s Africa partially might be built on the Western
presumption that Africa is without its own real history and culture – and that Disney
therefore had no interest in portraying Africans and their culture. Others have even hinted
at a certain reluctance by Disney to portray Africans as humans (see e.g. Byrne &
McQuillan, 1999). However, one can clearly only assume what Disney’s reasons for
excluding Africans and African history in The Lion King really were.
3.2.2 Stereotypical animals
Some examples of how Disney has played on cultural stereotypes through animals was
already presented in the beginning of this thesis. The characters in The Lion King are all,
as mentioned, talking animals, and the stereotypes that many of the earlier Disney animals
represent can be found here as well, which partially could be seen with the earlier
mentioned Rafiki. Giroux classifies this stereotyping as being done mostly through
“[r]acially coded representations and language” (2010: 110). Similarly to what is
happening in Aladdin, the “good” animals in The Lion King have been given brightercolored features, while the “bad” animals all have dark skin. Even the antagonist Scar –
another lion and a close relative to the protagonist – has a black mane and brown skin.
Like many of the Disney villains, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) is portrayed with a
British accent – arguably for the same reasons as Jafar. However, it is not the main
antagonist Scar, nor the eccentric Rafiki, that has been the main source of the criticism
regarding The Lion King.
In his Social Identities article from 1995, Gooding-Williams argues that Disney’s
Africa, in fact, is nothing more than an allegory for Disney’s America. In the film, the
civilized animals inhabit the prosperous pride lands (all taking part in the circle of life),
while the uncivilized antagonistic hyenas live in the “Elephant Graveyard” (the dangerous
“shadowy place”, to which Simba is forbidden to go) outside the lion kingdom. It is fairly
easy to argue that the land of the hyenas could be seen as a metaphor for the American
30

inner cities, or “ghettos” – especially when one takes a closer look at the racial
characteristics of the hyenas themselves. The two hyenas with actual lines in the film
(Shenzi and Banzai) are voiced by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin; and, similarly
to what happens in Aladdin, these characters do not use a “mainstream US English” like
the film’s “good characters”. While Goldberg’s Shenzi uses an African-American accent,
Marin’s Banzai (as Lippi-Green puts it) “shifts in and out of Latino-accented English,
throwing in Spanish at one point […] to make sure there is no mistake about his ethnicity”
(2012: 122). Towbin et al. also describes the hyenas in The Lion King as mimicking
“stereotypes of inner-city minorities; they are portrayed as sinister and thieving, and they
often complain that the lions maintain the power in their society” (2004: 36). The
antagonistic characteristics of the hyenas, combined with the way they talk and where
they live, really creates a stereotypical (and even racist) metaphor of ethnic minorities in
American inner cities. It is quite interesting how the African Americans, in a way, are
portrayed as “the other”, even in a story set in Africa.
However, as Byrne and McQuillan point out, this issue does still become
somewhat “complicated by the fact that both hyena and lion are figured as black” (1999:
103). Unlike Aladdin (where “Arabic” accents were provided by Caucasian voice actors),
many of the voice actors in The Lion King are African American, providing voices to both
“good” and “bad” characters. For instance, Simba’s parents are voiced by AfricanJamaican actress Madge Sinclair and African-American actor James Earl Jones. Even the
main protagonist could be regarded as partially African American, due to the fact that the
singing voice of young Simba is provided by Jason Weaver – known (among other things)
for playing a young Michael Jackson in “Young Jacksons: An American Dream”. This
consequently makes this issue less “black and white” than it is in Aladdin. Nevertheless,
one could still argue that the accents and dialects of the “bad” characters in The Lion King
are more distinguished than those of the “good” characters.

3.3 Mulan

Tsiek tsiek and again tsiek tsiek,
Mu-lan weaves, facing the door.
You don’t hear the shuttle’s sound,
You only hear Daughter’s sighs.
They ask Daughter who’s in her heart,
31

They ask Daughter who’s on her mind.
“No one is on Daughter’s heart,
No one is on Daughter’s mind.
Last night I saw the draft posters,
The Khan is calling many troops,
The army list is in twelve scrolls,
On every scroll there’s Father’s name.
Father has no grown-up son,
Mu-lan has no elder brother.
I want to buy a saddle and horse,
And serve in the army in Father’s place.”
(Frankel, 1976: 68)
So beings The Ballad of Mulan, the Chinese poem (here translated by Hans Frankel),
written sometime around the fifth or sixth century. While the main plot of the poem and
Disney’s Mulan are somewhat similar, there are still, however, certain differences
between the original and Disney’s version. Some of these differences, described in the
following subchapters, did not necessarily work in Disney’s favor.
3.3.1 When West meets East
In a similar manner as with Aladdin and The Lion King, the audience is exposed to the
foreign culture of Mulan as soon as the film begins. Exotic music plays as the screen
follows what looks like calligraphic lines, before the title Mulan appears above a red
dragon. The screen then fades in on the Great Wall, where the plot of the film immediately
begins. Here, the audience is quickly introduced to the antagonists of the film – the Huns,
who have begun their invasion of China. Chinese warning beacons are lit, and the screen
cuts to the Forbidden City – another iconic piece of Chinese setting – where the Emperor
declares that one man from every family shall enlist and protect their homeland against
the invaders. This type of representation of Chinese culture retains a presence throughout
the film, and Disney has, in fact, received some praise for its portrayal of China (see e.g.
Dong, 2010: 164). China in itself is, unlike Aladdin’s Agrabah, not portrayed as a barbaric
wasteland, but as an impressive kingdom, filled with cherry trees, high mountains and
beautiful architecture. Simultaneously, unlike The Lion King, Mulan’s China is actually
inhabited by people that lived during a (more or less) specific time in history.
However, while Mulan clearly did well domestically (as it is included as one of
the most popular films in this study), it was still, as mentioned earlier, somewhat
32

unsuccessful in China. While the disappointing box office results in China might be
related to timing and other more bureaucratic issues, Chinese audiences also criticized
the film for being too Western (BBC News, 1999). This time it was not the general
representation of China that was the problem, but rather the representation of its cultural
values. Ward discusses this criticism in Mouse Morality, and argues that Disney here
favors the (generalized) “Western” individualistic values, over the “Eastern” collectivistic
values (2002: 97-99). While the Mulan of the original poem goes to war for honor,
Disney’s Mulan does it (as she later admits) to find out who she really is – a common
theme in Disney’s films. Nevertheless, unlike earlier examples in this analysis, this is not
really a case of stereotyping, but rather westernization and disneyfication. While this
makes this issue more complicated in terms of racial and ethnic portrayals, the choice to
include Western values in a Western movie aimed for children is also somewhat more
understandable and even defensible. Nevertheless, this does become a question of cultural
appropriation, and this particular disneyfication does, in fact, become problematic, as it
leads to a certain “othering”, described in the following sub-chapter.
3.3.2 The American, the Chinese, and the African American
In the already mentioned documentary Mickey Mouse Monopoly, its writer and producer,
Chyng Feng Sun, states the following:
If we compared the Siamese cats [Aristocats, 1970] with Mulan, I must say
that Disney has made very significant improvement in the visual portrayal
of Chinese. However, in order to create this model feminist figure, China is
portrayed as probably the most sexist and oppressive society in all Disney's
children's films.
(Chyng, 2001)
As already stated, and as many have noticed and criticized (see e.g. Dong, 2010), Mulan,
as a character, is portrayed with many Western values. She has been regarded as one of
the most feminist and progressive “Disney Princesses”, and she repeatedly has to work
hard to prove herself in a China dominated by men. Throughout the film, she is being told
to be quiet in a man’s presence, and many of the musical numbers feature lines such as:
Men want girls with good taste
Calm
Obedient
33

Who work fast-paced
With good breeding
And a tiny waist
You’ll bring honor to us all
(Mulan, 1998)
Furthermore, the song “Honor to us all”, to which these lines belong, is later countered
by Mulan’s solo performance “Reflection”; in which the protagonist sings about her role
in the world, about fitting in, and about being true to whom she actually is. According to
Ward, this is “a conflicted version of Chinese culture, one that attempts to acknowledge
the collectivist mind-set but in reality sets in within a Western idea of individualism”
(2002: 112). Mulan both questions and breaks the norms of Chinese society – and
simultaneously becomes “American”, all while making China “the other”.
Nevertheless, the visual or linguistic othering, which clearly was present in
Aladdin and The Lion King, is not as clear in Mulan. Even though the leader of the Huns,
Shan Yu, is portrayed almost animal-like (big and skulking, with yellow eyes and fangs),
the Chinese soldiers retain more sympathetic and non-stereotypical features. The film
sticks to this formula in relation to other aspects as well; with the Huns being the bad
“others”, while the Chinese remain the good (and civilized) characters. This is, of course,
still a case of othering, but not a polarization of Western and non-Western, or Caucasian
and non-Caucasian, which has been the case in earlier films. Mulan has, as mentioned,
really received some praise for its representation of China, and old stereotypes of
“Chinese cunning, deviousness, duplicity […], treachery, greed and malice” (Schweiger,
2007: 128) are barely present in the film. However, it is still worth repeating that the
general Chinese population remains “the other” in relation to the Western-valued
protagonist. They are not “the worst other”, but “the other” nonetheless.
It would also not be a Disney film without some comic relief from an ethnic
minority character. In Mulan, this part is filled by the little red dragon Mushu, voiced by
Eddie Murphy. While one might find a well-established comedian such as Murphy perfect
for this part, and while the character Mushu is likeable, he is still portrayed as “a fasttalking, self-absorbed Chinese dragon and the self-appointed guardian of Fa Mulan”.
This description, found and the top of the character’s entry in the Disney Wiki (2019), is
not necessarily positive, and does, ironically enough, resemble Giroux’s quite critic
description of Mushu as “a servile and boastful clown who seems unsuited to a mythic
fable about China” (Giroux, 2010: 110). Linguistically, Mushu is clearly African
34

American, and while he remains one of the “good guys”, it is still difficult to ignore some
of his more negative characteristics and the way these specific character traits tend to link
themselves to certain ethnicities in Disney’s films. This particular issue does, however,
raise a question partially found in Brode’s work (2005: 264): is this type of comic
character (self-centered, fast-talking, and obnoxious) then “off-limits” for actors that
belong to a specific ethnic minority? Would it have been better if a Caucasian or Asian
voice actor had portrayed the character Mushu? This would have meant that no AfricanAmerican actors would have been included in Mulan. This issue will be discussed further
in Chapter 4.

3.4 Lilo & Stitch

Lilo & Stitch does, as mentioned, appear to be one of the least criticized films examined
in this study. However, while it also is the only film from Disney’s Post-Renaissance Era
to pass this study’s popularity criteria, it simultaneously remains one of the less popular
films analyzed in this thesis. Although dealing with alien creatures, the majority of the
film’s main characters are Hawaiian, and almost the entire film is set on the island of
Kauai. Lilo & Stitch was originally supposed to be set in Kansas, but the location was
later changed by directors Sanders and DeBlois. Consequently, the tools Disney use to
portray Hawaii, its people, and its culture will now be examined in more detail.
3.4.1 Welcome to paradise
Unlike all of the earlier examined films, Lilo & Stitch does not begin in the foreign culture
that is portrayed throughout the narrative, but in space. In this prologue, the experiment
626 (a.k.a. Stitch) and his creator Jumba are facing a trial at the “Space Federation”, and
Stitch is eventually imprisoned as he is rendered too dangerous to be free. Stitch does,
however, escape and an intense spaceship chase follows. Stitch still manages to get away,
but the Space Federation are not too worried; his ship is heading towards a small island
on the planet “E-arth”, which consists mostly of water, and Experiment 626 cannot swim.
This is where we cut to the main title, as Hawaiian music (performed and partially
composed by Hawaiian musician Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu) is playing in the background.
In a similar fashion as in the already analyzed films, the audience is introduced to the
35

film’s main setting via exotic colors and visuals. Colorful exotic fish fill the screen,
dolphins are swimming in the ocean, the water is clear blue (almost turquoise), and a little
girl (Lilo) is swimming through the ocean. She rushes to her hula dance class, and
manages to sneak in and join the performance even though she is late. This is Hawaii – a
tropical and exotic, yet relatively modern, paradise, portrayed in a very positive light.
After introducing Lilo as the other main character, and establishing the relationship
between her and her “friends”, as well as her sister Nani, Stitch enters the picture. He is
adopted by Lilo, who believes him to be a dog, and they eventually become close friends.
As the alien initially tries to find a way off the island, riding Lilo’s bicycle from coast to
coast, we are introduced to many typical (and real) landmarks of Kauai; beaches filled
with tourists, large cliffs and mountains, and even the Kilauea Lighthouse. The audience
is constantly reminded that they are in Hawaii, and the corresponding exoticism would
probably have been more difficult to achieve if the film had been set in Kansas.
But does this exoticism become problematic, in a similar fashion as it, for instance,
did in Aladdin? The truth is that it almost does not. A quick google search on stereotypes
about modern Hawaii and Hawaiians gives us examples like, “Hawaiians live in grass
huts on the beach”, “They ride dolphins to school or work”, and “Girls walk around in
coconut bikinis” (Keoni, 2017) – but none of these stereotypes are reinforced in Lilo &
Stitch. Dolphins do swim close to Lilo as she makes her way to hula practice, but she does
not ride them; the hula practice takes place in a wooden house, not a hut; and the hula
dancers are wearing traditional hula clothing, not coconut bikinis. The film does, in other
words, address the cultural and geographical characteristics of its setting without building
on stereotypes. Lilo & Stitch actually received a lot of praise for its fair and accurate
portrayal of Hawaii, and has been considered, among other things, as “the film that best
captures the true spirit of Hawaii” (Fischer, 2019).
Another interesting aspect about Disney’s Hawaii in Lilo & Stitch is the fact that
the setting mostly is seen through the eyes of a local – Lilo. The following statement
about imagology and Polynesia can be found in Beller and Leerssen (2007):
The vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean […] has long been the ultimate locus
of exoticism in the European imagination. In the European literary
imagination, the Pacific islands take shape as a tropical otherworld where
strayed travelers are marooned: from Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe to
Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver.
(Leersen, 2007: 219)
36

These narratives are, in other words, often told through the perspective of a Western
character. While it is true that Stitch is a stranger to Hawaii and its customs, as well as
someone who technically has been shipwrecked and stranded on a tropical island, Lilo
(arguably) still remains the main protagonist. This is supported by the fact that Stitch is
an alien of few words. One can suspect that the chance for offensive or stereotypical
representation might have been higher, if a similar story where the alien would have been
replaced by a Western character had been made.
3.4.2 Natives, locals, tourists, and aliens
On her way to hula practice, Lilo stops to take a picture of a tourist having an ice cream.
This is one of her hobbies, she collects photos of tourists and put them up on her wall. In
this film, it is, in fact, the white tourists that seems to be the anomalies – not the locals.
This brings us to the question regarding the characters themselves. Is there a certain
westernization of the protagonists or more positive characters, similarly as in Mulan, or
an “othering” of the remaining local population?
Besides being a local, the protagonist Lilo is also portrayed as native Hawaiian.
Lilo is voiced by American voice actor Daveigh Chase, while Lilo’s sister Nani is voiced
by Hawaiian voice actor Tia Carrere. Naturally, the sisters speak somewhat differently,
but no certain non-lingual characteristics are associated with either accent. Nani’s love
interest David, portrayed by Hawaiian voice actor Jason Scott Lee, might have an even
stronger Hawaiian accent, and uses pidgin words and phrases, such as “howzit”, several
times. Although he might provide some comical relief and come across as the
stereotypical “surfer dude”, he is, nonetheless, generally portrayed in a good light.
Furthermore, since the antagonists of this film all are aliens, it is difficult to argue
that they would feed into stereotypes about Hawaiians or Polynesians. It is worth pointing
out that the antagonist Jumba (who later sides with the protagonists) is portrayed with
what could be regarded as a Russian accent, while Captain Gantu (who ruthlessly chases
Stitch throughout the film) is voiced by African-American voice actor Kevin Michael
Richardson. While a mad scientist with a Russian accent might be something of a classic
stereotype, the African-American voice for Captain Gantu was arguably only a
combination of a big and intimidating character and its need for a deep and powerful
voice. Whatever the case may be, it is still quite safe to acknowledge the lack of a clear37

cut distinction between Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian characters in terms of positive or
negative attributes.
Another aspect Disney seems to have gotten right in this film is the portrayal of
the general population of Hawaii. The people on the island are not divided into “native
Hawaiians” and “white tourists” (which could have been the case with a simple film
affected by disneyfication), but the film actually shows locals of very different ethnic
backgrounds. According to the United States Census Bureau statistics, only 10.2 percent
of the Hawaiian population regard themselves as native Hawaiian alone (U.S. Department
of Commerce, 2019), and Lilo & Stitch seems to stay quite true to these statistics. In her
article “Family, Race and Citizenship in Disney’s Lilo and Stitch”, Emily Cheng
describes Disney’s Hawaii as a “multiracial paradise” (2007: 125), and it truly seems as
if Disney avoids the mistake of simplifying the population of Hawaii in a similar manner
as they might have done in earlier films.
It is, however, still worth mentioning that the home-release of the film includes a
deleted scene, in which comic relief and even othering is received at the expense of the
white American tourists. In this particular scene, stereotypical white tourists drive up to
Lilo, asking for directions to the beach while mispronouncing Hawaiian words such as
“mahalo”. While Disney avoided all forms of othering by excluding this from the
theatrical version, it would still have been interesting to see how this specific scene would
have been received by Western audiences, had it stayed in the film. This would have
strengthened Brode’s argument (2005: 2) regarding Disney’s representations being
caricatures of all kinds of people, rather than stereotypes of specific demographics.

3.5 The Princess and the Frog

Long ago and far away, she was an unnamed little princess in a little story
called the ‘The Frog Prince’. […] One day, through the magical powers of
Disney animation and commercial marketing, the forgotten little princess
was transformed into Tiana, a beautiful black princess from New Orleans.
She became the star of ‘The Princess and the Frog’, a movie set to premiere
in November. Her doll and toy set were unveiled last month, and the Disney
promotional machine is already humming, for Tiana is the first Disney
princess in more than a decade, and the first ever to be black.
(Tucker, 2009)

Disney’s return to the traditional hand-drawn princess-musical was big news for many.
That Disney was going to produce a movie with a female African-American protagonist
was, still, even bigger. However, with The Princess and the Frog being the arguably least
popular of the films included in this study, one could yet wonder how well the world
remembers Tiana as the first black Disney princess, especially since this particular
animated feature is one of the more controversial films included in this study. This is also
the only analyzed film that is set in a city in the continental United States. The criticism
is therefore, simultaneously, “closer to home” for its American audiences.
3.5.1 The African-American frog and a Maldonian prince
One of the most criticized aspects in relation to The Princess and the Frog (see e.g.
Gehlawat, 2010) is the fact that Disney’s first African-American princess spends more
time on the screen as a frog rather than a human. After 28 minutes of runtime, Tiana
agrees to kiss Naveen and is, as a result, turned into a frog. During the film’s 88th minute,
Tiana and Naveen break the spell and become human again, after which Tiana gets to
spend about two more minutes on screen as a real princess, before the credits start to roll.
The longed-for first African-American Disney princess is, in other words, portrayed as a
frog for about 66 percent of the actual film. Critics have also questioned Disney’s choice
to feature the protagonist as a waitress, rather than as royalty (Lester, 2010) – and the
status of Tiana as “the first, African-American Disney Princess” could consequently be
questioned. However, while it is true that many of the characters regarded as “Disney
princesses” have been of royal heritage, it is also essential to point out that some have
not. For instance, Cinderella (Cinderella, 1950), an incredibly archetypal character in
relation to this category and franchise, does not become a princess until the very end of
her film – just like Tiana.
The criticism regarding royalty in The Princess and the Frog does, however, not
end with the princess, but is directed towards her prince as well. Prior to the film’s release,
the ethnicity of Prince Naveen of Maldonia had already been questioned by many (see
e.g. Barnes 2009) – mainly due to the fact that the brighter-skinned Naveen, voiced by
Brazilian voice actor Bruno Campos, clearly is not African American. While Disney has
argued that Naveen remains non-Caucasian (Barnes, 2009), some have yet pointed out
how unfortunate it was that Disney passed on the opportunity to present the first Disney
animated fairytale ending for a black couple, by not portraying Naveen as African
39

American (Lester, 2010). It has even been argued that Disney’s choice to feature a nonblack prince derives from Disney’s supposed unwillingness to give a black man the title
of prince (Barnes, 2009).
3.5.2 Colorblindness, blackness, and whiteness
The setting of The Princess and the Frog is another questionable issue, which relates a
great deal to the earlier discussed criticism regarding Disney’s 1942-feature Song of the
South. Disney chose to place its first story featuring an African-American protagonist in
1920s New Orleans – a city and period immensely affected by the segregation and the
Jim Crow Laws. However, while the setting and story partially is affected by its racist
time period and its injustices, Disney fails to address these issues almost entirely. This is
where the earlier mentioned issue of colorblindness (discussed by, e.g. Breaux, 2010)
becomes relevant. In The Princess and the Frog, Disney has tried to create a New Orleans
without any existing racism; where an African-American girl can own a restaurant, where
her mother possesses the title as “the finest seamstress in New Orleans”, and where Tiana
and her white, rich friend, as well as employer; Charlotte, can enjoy a close friendship,
without complications due to issues concerning race and class. This is a colorful, yet
colorblind, fairytale New Orleans. Disney claims that The Princess and the Frog was
created to entertain – not educate (McCoy Gregory, 2010: 443), and the decision to avoid
issues like segregation and the Jim Crow laws could therefore, arguably, be justified.
Nevertheless, if Disney wanted to take a step away from the question of race, and still do
justice to their African-American audience, one could wonder why they chose to set the
story in this city, with its history of segregation and racism, instead of in an unbiased
fairytale land. When Disney decides not to present the problems and limitations which
racism brought upon the African-American community during the 1920s, the issue of
segregation and the social status of the African Americans is never explained, and an
audience without knowledge of history might just get the assumption that it is natural that,
for instance, Tiana’s family and the whole black community live in simple bungalows
outside the city. In other words, Disney stays somewhat true to history regarding the
African Americans’ low social status in 1920s New Orleans, while the film studio
simultaneously rewrites history by never addressing the circumstances and by (partially)
providing these black characters with the same possibilities as the film’s white characters.

40

While Disney remains somewhat colorblind regarding the issues presented above,
there is still a certain portrayal of blackness present throughout The Princess and the
Frog. Due to the film’s status as “a first”, Disney’s representation of blackness, i.e. the
portrayal of African Americans and African-American culture in this particular film, has
generally received a great deal of attention, and is consequently brought up in many of
the articles chosen as secondary sources for this analysis (see e.g. Gehlawat, Lester, and
McCoy Gregory). Hence, it is not only the portrayal of the films main characters and
setting that has been a target for a substantial amount of criticism; but the portrayal of
supporting characters and issues regarding blackness as well. For instance, the approach
towards magic in The Princess and the Frog arguably differs a great deal from the
traditional Disney fairy-tale magic. Instead of sparkles and fairy godmothers, we now
have voodoo and dark magic, practiced on by both “good” and “bad” characters alike.
Furthermore, the traditional Disney magic represented through songs such as “When You
Wish upon a Star” has been exchanged for lines such as “But you remember […], that old
star can only take you part of a way. You got to help him with some hard work of your
own. And then […] you can do anything you set your mind to”. This also ties into the
general themes of the film, that likewise differ from the ones found in earlier Disneyprincess narratives. Tiana is a hardworking independent woman with the goal of starting
her own restaurant – she is not, as already established, a princess in search of a prince.
While some of these themes could be regarded as bringing variation and modern values
to a Disney-princess narrative, they have simultaneously raised questions among many
viewers (Lester, 2010). Whether these themes and elements really are Disney’s way of
representing blackness can, however, still be discussed.
In contrast to the representation of blackness, it is still worth mentioning that some
stereotyping, or caricaturizing (as Brode would call it), of whiteness does exist in The
Princess and the Frog. Unlike Lilo & Stitch, both theatrical- and home-releases of the
film does include scenes where comic relief is achieved at some of the white characters’
expense. One of the more prominent characters in relation to this issue is arguably Tiana’s
friend Charlotte LaBouff; a rich white Southern girl, who originally is the one who is
supposed to marry Prince Naveen. In her 2010 article, McCoy Gregory discusses the
representation of blackness and whiteness in The Princess and the Frog, and argues that
“the film suggests that the audience is to embrace Tiana as a black princess” (2010: 438).
This is a quite simple task due to Charlotte’s spoiled, hysterical and satirical character. In
fact, almost all of the white characters in The Princess and the Frog are quite
41

caricaturized, as can be seen by looking at, for instance, the overweight and rich Eli “Big
Daddy” LaBouff, the dorky Fenner Brothers, or the stupid and unpleasant frog hunters.
However, most of the white characters in The Princess and the Frog are white
Southerners, based on typical stereotypes about the American South. Due to the role of
the film as Disney’s first African-American narrative, one might understand Disney’s
choice to give the positive attributes to the African-American characters, rather than the
Caucasian characters. Nevertheless, the validity of the title as “Disney’s first AfricanAmerican narrative” loses stature, due to the fact that African Americans, a minority with
a history of being exposed to stereotyping, now only has been put up against another
stereotyped group – white Southerners. Instead of letting the African-American
characters coexist with non-stereotypical white characters, Disney has turned all white
characters in this particular film into satirical representatives of Southern whiteness.
Instead of giving Tiana a challenging competition in the form of a, more or less,
sympathetic character, they put her up against Charlotte, whom many hardly regard as a
desirable princess. This results in a more unserious narrative, compared to the earlier films
that feature Disney Princesses. One could wonder if it would have been as easy for Disney
to give Tiana her fairytale ending if a white character with the attributes of a previous
Disney princess had replaced Charlotte LaBouff.

3.6 Big Hero 6

After Disney’s acquisition of Marvel in 2009, and the company’s rising success after the
release of Frozen in 2013, Walt Disney Animation Studios decided to make their own
animated superhero-feature. Similarly to Lilo & Stitch, Big Hero 6 did not receive a lot
of negative criticism in relation to their portrayal of race and ethnicity. This is quite
interesting due to the fact that the majority of the film’s characters are part of an ethnic
minority. Another fascinating aspect regarding this film is its fictional JapaneseAmerican hybrid setting, which surely will be an interesting aspect of this analysis.
3.6.1 San Fransokyo
While the story of Marvel’s original comic book is set in Tokyo, Disney decided to create
their own fictional setting for Big Hero 6 – the hybrid futuristic combination of San
42

Francisco and Tokyo, San Fransokyo. The film begins with an overview of Disney’s
creation; the camera pans over the Golden Gate Bridge, which now has Japanese
archways added to it; we see the Port of San Fransokyo; trams decorated with Japanese
lanterns are making their way through the city; all while neon signs and more advanced
means of transportation seen in the background gives the fictional city a more futuristic
look. This hybrid mash-up has actually been praised for not building on stereotypes. In
his review in The New Yorker, Roland Kelts states the following:
I pictured a crudely expanded version of San Francisco’s existing
Chinatown, with maybe a few additional sushi counters and one or two
Pikachu or Totoro dolls cluttering the background. Instead, the movie’s
metropolitan portmanteau is a marvel of architectural alchemy. Shibuya
skyscrapers with pulsing video screens hug San Francisco’s iconic
Transamerica Pyramid. Victorian Mission duplexes line hilly San
Fransokyo neighborhoods, aglow from the pink-white light of Japanese
cherry blossoms in full bloom below. Trains from the Yamanote and Chuo
lines, two of Tokyo’s central and most popular railways, stream by on
elevated tracks. […] In “Big Hero 6,” such authentic details add up to a
portrait of two onscreen cultures sharing the same world, undiluted by their
affinities, tethered by mutual respect.
(Kelts, 2014)
While many might agree with this, one could still ask oneself why Disney decided to
change the original setting of Big Hero 6 in the first place. The answer is yet probably
quite simple, especially when taking into account the earlier examined films in this study.
Disney has clearly received a great deal of criticism for their westernization of foreign
cultures, and the change of setting from Tokyo to San Fransokyo could be seen as another
example of this form of disneyfication. However, instead of portraying a real place and
incorporating it with western elements (such as the individualistic values in Mulan), or
creating a fictional setting based on a foreign culture (like Aladdin’s Agrabah), Disney
combines two cultures in this film, picking out “the best of both worlds”.
Nevertheless, some problematic issues regarding this utopian setting still remain.
In a research paper by Jamie Uy (2016), San Fransokyo is analyzed as a “Third Space”.
In postcolonial theory “Third Space” or “hybridity” (defined by Homi Bhabha in The
Location of Culture, 2004), could be described as the phenomenon where different
cultures come together or are combined, rather than being compared as polar opposites.
This seems to be the case with San Fransokyo. However, the main parts of San Fransokyo
are still arguably based on San Francisco. In the earlier described intro scene, the audience
43

is actually introduced to San Franciscan landmarks, with a Japanese twist. Furthermore,
the data model that was used in the animation process of Big Hero 6 is (according to the
film’s producers) an exact replica of San Francisco. Uy consequently argues the
following:
The unquestioned use of San Francisco as the base for hybrid worldconstruction is problematic since it embodies an assumption of American
culture as the norm for or foundation of global culture, suggesting an
ethnocentrism at odds with the hybrid agenda of the film. San Fransokyo is
San Francisco, but Japanified, and not as easily read as Tokyo, but
Americanized; a distinction that weakens the idea that both cultures equally
influence and merge with one another.
(Uy, 2016: 9)
One could, however, still ask oneself how Big Hero 6 would have been received, if Disney
had explicitly taken Tokyo (the original setting of the comic book) as a base and
Americanized it with various elements, since this is what Disney generally tends to do
and already has done in films such as Mulan. By giving the film a multicultural setting,
one could also argue that Disney has eliminated the chance of getting accused for
westernizing its characters.
3.6.2 Ethnic minorities in a multiracial setting
Hiro Hamada, around whom the film revolves, has come to be known as Disney’s first
mixed-race protagonist. However, unlike with Tiana in The Princess and the Frog, not as
much focus was put on Hiro’s race by audiences or critics –nor by the film itself. In San
Fransokyo, Hiro is just a normal Japanese-American 14-year-old boy who lives with his
Japanese-American brother and his Caucasian aunt. The racial composition of Hiro’s
family is never addressed in the film, and it never becomes a problem in a similar way as
it did with the somewhat unrealistic and colorblind relationships portrayed in The
Princess and the Frog. Hiro is never limited or affected by his race or ethnicity in any
way, and the plot and the setting would probably have worked as well if Hiro were African
American, Hispanic, or Caucasian. While the protagonist’s intelligence might build on
the stereotype of the “smart Asian”, Hiro Hamada is, in fact, Japanese in the original Big
Hero 6 comic, which thus would render Disney “innocent” in this case – as they rather
westernize him more (by making him mixed-race) than build on that specific stereotype.
44

The questionable names of the other superheroes of Big Hero 6 (many resembling
sushi ingredients) are in a similar fashion a product of the source material. Disney have,
however, changed the ethnicity of all team members, as they all originally were Japanese.
While Hiro, as mentioned, is Japanese-American, Go Go Tamago is Korean-American,
Wasabi is African American, Fred is Caucasian, and Honey Lemon is (arguably)
Hispanic. In a multicultural setting such as San Fransokyo, one could argue that the
ethnically diverse team (and voice cast) is quite appropriate. Unlike the minority
portrayals in earlier Disney features, cultural stereotypes are also avoided when it comes
to these characters. Uy (2016) does, however, criticize the supporting characters and
argue that Disney, in fact, only has reverted the stereotypes.
Korean-American Go Go Tamago is squarely “an adrenaline junkie” and
“speed demon” and not a polite, shy student; African-American Wasabi NoGinger is a “risk-averse neatnik” instead of a tough, brazen muscleman;
Latina Honey Lemon is a sweet, clever chemist as opposed to an oversexualized service worker; Caucasian Fred, who appears to be “the dirtiest,
grungiest, slacker-est member of the team” is actually phenomenally
wealthy […].
(Uy, 2016: 12)
This might be true, but one must also take into account the type of film Big Hero 6 actually
is. In a 108-minute animated feature film it might be difficult to give all supportive
characters deeper and more nuanced personalities and back stories. Disney has, as we can
see by looking at older feature films, always relied on some forms of stereotypes or
simplifications to achieve comedy. That Disney subverts expectations here could
therefore still be seen as some form of progression towards a more culturally sensitive
and non-stereotypical film era.

3.7 Moana

The final film included in this study is clearly a part of the more modern Disney era, as it
(similarly to Big Hero 6) is somewhat free from criticism regarding ethnicity and culture.
The most controversial issue found in critical reviews and articles on this film seems, in
fact, to be related to merchandising. Before the film was even released, Disney started
promoting a Maui costume for children; a brown-skinned full-body suit with tribal
45

tattoos, accompanied by Maui’s grass skirt and his necklace made of bone and teeth. The
reaction to this particular piece of merchandising was strong, and after being accused of
depicting brownface, Disney quickly withdrew the costume from all its stores (Rika,
2016). While this, as well as the actual film version of Maui have been the main sources
of Moana’s criticism, the culture and the characters portrayed in the film (although less
criticized) will still be examined further in the following analysis.
3.7.1 History vs. mystery
The story of Moana begins on a fictional Polynesian island, in the village of Motonui.
Moana and her tribe has lived on this island for a long time and they are running out of
food sources, but no one is allowed to leave the island due to the dangers of the ocean.
The inspiration for this story came, according to directors Clements and Musker, from
the Polynesian wayfinder-civilizations that navigated the oceans about 3,000 years ago,
but then suddenly stopped. After a 1,000-year break, which historians still do not know
the reason for (Herman 2016), wayfinding did once more become a popular practice, and
it is here Moana’s fictional story comes in.
Musker and Clements took some liberties with the explanation of the 1,000-year
gap in the Polynesian wayfinding, also known as “the long pause” (Herman, 2016), but,
as already mentioned, no one seems to know the exact reason for this particular pause.
This, consequently, makes this case very different from, for example, The Princess and
the Frog, where the same directors could be accused of re-writing the history of the
portrayed demographic. The time-period in which the film is set does also make Moana
different from the other films in this study, as the only other film with the most definable
“ancient” setting besides Moana, seems to be Mulan. A thousand years is a long period
of time, and one would think that it would be difficult to agitate or offend people when
portraying fictional people of a real demographic that existed such a long time ago.
Nevertheless, to still give a fair and correct portrayal of Polynesian culture, Musker and
Clements, together with their team, travelled to Fiji, Samoa and Tahiti. Similarly to how
it had been done in relation to earlier Disney projects, the filmmakers familiarized
themselves with the culture, its history and the people in general. During the planning
stage of the film, the film makers even created the Oceanic Story Trust, a focus group
consisting of indigenous people from various fields and different Polynesian islands. This
group of people was, according to the Musker and Clements, an essential part of the film
46

making progress, and it seems as if their input actually changed some of the more
problematic scenes that otherwise would have been in the film. As a result, many
historical aspects of Polynesian culture (however a mixture of Samoan, Hawaiian, Maori,
etc.) are arguably portrayed correctly and respectfully in Moana, for example through the
songs “There You Are” and “We Know the Way”.
In a typical Disney musical such as Moana, there does, however, have to be some
magic and mystery, and it is here some issues become a bit more complicated. In the
fictional story of Moana, the earlier resourceful and flourishing world is dying, all
because the demigod Maui stole the heart of the deity Te Fiti. To restore her island (and
the whole world) to its former flourishing state, Moana has to find Maui, and return the
heart to its original place. While many elements found in Polynesian legends and myths
(life, death, water, fire, etc.) are present throughout the film, Te Fiti, as well as the lava
monster Te Kā (Te Fiti’s antagonistic counterpart), remains fictional. The filmmakers
have, in this case, taken different elements from different aspects of Polynesian culture
and produced their own disneyfied version of it all. However, while audiences seem to
accept these aspects of the film, it is really the aforementioned demigod Maui (a character
that actually exist in many Polynesian legends) that has received some criticism.
Critics have argued that Disney’s Maui is quite different from the original
Polynesian stories. While the heroic Polynesian Maui often has been depicted as “a
teenager nearing manhood, a sort of trickster ﬁgure, well-dressed, charming, and
intelligent” (Anjirbag, 2018), Maui in Moana is very muscular and big, and although
charming and a bit of a trickster, this version of the demigod is arguably not very
intelligent or even heroic. While some have criticized Maui’s appearance and argued that
his size plays on the stereotype of Polynesians as obese (see e.g. Downes, 2016), Disney
has again claimed that Maui’s size is supposed to display power. Whatever the case may
be, it is clear that Maui (voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) is not the main hero of
the story, but rather a source of comic relief in Disney’s Moana. Due to this “dumbeddown” representation, one could argue that it is quite problematic that Disney’s Maui now
is the more known version of the demigod, at least in the Western world. In her BBC
article from 2016, Arieta Rika argues that: “After the release of Moana, Maui may be a
Disney character to some, but to many Pacific people, he is very real - a hero, ancestor,
demi-God and a spiritual guide”. It would be interesting to see what kind of reaction this
kind of cultural misappropriation would prompt among Christian Western audiences, had
a non-Western film studio turned Jesus of Nazareth into a comical sidekick.
47

3.7.2 Polynesian representation
Nevertheless, when it comes to the other Polynesian characters in the film, it is again
quite difficult to point out any clear “othering” or stereotyping. Most voice actors in
Moana were also of Polynesian origins, and only one Caucasian voice actor, Alan Tudyk,
was part of the main cast. Tudyk voices HeiHei, a non-talking, non-intelligent chicken,
and similarly to earlier films, this animal side-kick is another source of comical relief.
However, this time the animal does not talk, which simultaneously might make Tudyk’s
performance irrelevant in a discussion regarding ethnic portrayals. If HeiHei really had
been portrayed as (a talking) Caucasian, Moana would also have been subject to the same
“othering”, or “[caricaturizing] for entertainment purposes” (Brode, 2005: 264), that we
see in other films – only with the roles reversed and the Caucasian being “the other”. In
conclusion, there is really no clearly Othered, negative or stereotypical individuals among
the talking main characters. While Moana’s grandmother might be portrayed as “the
village crazy lady”, she is still likeable and her portrayal does not differ linguistically or
visually from the other characters. Similarly, the only speaking antagonist, the giant
monster turtle Tamatoa (voiced by Jermaine Clement), does have his quirks, but none of
them play on ethnic stereotypes. Furthermore, an antagonistic Polynesian in a film where
the majority of characters are Polynesians, does not stand out, and the division or
westernization present in earlier Disney films is, in other words, not as central here.
There is, however, a rather questionable scene that resembles the issues found in
the more problematic films included in this study. In this particular scene, Moana, Maui,
and HeiHei are attacked by a pirate-gang consisting of anthropomorphic coconuts, known
as the Kakamora. Besides the fact that the Kakamora already exist in Polynesian legends,
however as slightly shorter humanlike creatures and not coconuts (Herman, 2016), this
example becomes even more problematic due to the importance of the coconut in
Polynesian culture (partly described in the song “Where You Are”), and the way this
cultural element has been portrayed in this specific scene. This is arguably a combination
of both disneyfication and a certain orientalism; with Disney taking an “exotic” element
and “dumbing it down”. It is, in fact, quite seldom one sees this kind of satire in Disney
films that portray Western culture, and it would be quite unimaginable for many to see,
for example, the characters Belle and the Beast, who exist within the narrative set in
France in Beauty and the Beast, fighting monsters made out of baguettes and wine in the
forest, rather than the wolves which originally exist in that film.
48

4. Discussion

With the film analyses found in the previous chapter as a base, we should now know the
answer to one of the research questions for this thesis; we know how Disney has portrayed
race and ethnicity in these seven specific feature films, but the main question still remains
partially unanswered. To determine how Disney’s approach towards race and ethnicity
has changed over time, we now need to further discuss and examine the results, found in
the film analyses. A clear overview, as well as a systematic comparison between the
results and issues found in the different films, will hopefully clear up the issue regarding
change in Disney’s aforementioned portrayals.

4.1 Overview

The portrayals of racial and ethnic minority characters and cultures, analyzed in the
previous chapter, will here be presented in a general overview. This subchapter will be
quite central to the earlier hypothesis (mentioned in chapter 2.2), as we here should be
able to see whether Disney’s portrayals of race and ethnicity have become more
progressive and culturally sensitive with time. Which film could be regarded as having
the most problematic representation, and which film could be considered as having the
fairest representation of ethnic and racial minority characters? Have the most problematic
films been released during Disney’s Renaissance Era, while the more culturally sensitive
features all belong to the Revival Era? The answers to these questions will arguably lead
to a better understanding of Disney’s general approach towards race and ethnicity.
Based on the results found in the previous chapter, Aladdin is clearly the most
problematic feature included in this study. Apart from being a textbook example of
orientalism, as well as a subject of a great deal of othering, parts of the original film even
had to be changed due to its extensive criticism. A post-cinematic release edit such as the
change of lyrics in “Arabian Nights” has, in fact, not occurred with any other Disney film
since Aladdin. As it also is the oldest film included in this study, its status as the most
problematic film works well with the aforementioned hypothesis, and provides us with a
valid starting point for analyzing and determining change. For the original hypothesis to
49

hold, we should now see constant positive progress in Disney’s racial and ethnic
portrayals, which is somewhat true for the following film; The Lion King. While being
far from perfect in relation to its portrayal of African Americans and Hispanics, The Lion
King was still not accused of having “slandered the heritage” of an entire culture (see the
earlier criticism on Aladdin by Shaheen, 1993). While the racial profiling that the
aforementioned hyenas represent, combined with their antagonistic roles, clearly is
problematic, they are still only a minor part of the film as a whole, and not necessarily as
clearly racist as the representation and othering of the ever present human Arab characters
in Aladdin. Mulan also continues the predicted progression towards a more culturally
sensitive Disney. Although the disneyfication of the Chinese ballad and its protagonist
might be controversial, it is still a somewhat small issue compared to the racist and
offensive nature of the issues found in the earlier films. Nevertheless, the othering of
Chinese people that emerges with the westernization of its main protagonist, still renders
this feature somewhat problematic.
Lilo & Stitch is, however, not only step towards an even more progressive
representation of ethnic and racial minorities, but arguably the film with the fairest and
most positive representation of a culture, included in this study. This film’s (here given)
status as the most progressive film will be discussed further in the following sub-chapters,
as it clearly is interesting that a relatively popular film from a relatively unpopular era of
Disney filmmaking seems to get so much right, especially since even some of its
successors seem to have failed where Lilo & Stitch succeeded.
One of the most interesting films in this overview is yet probably The Princess
and the Frog, as many of the issues found in its analysis, as well as the generally negative
criticism that have surrounded it, would place the film somewhere between Mulan and
The Lion King in terms of the fairness of its ethnic and racial portrayals. When
considering the ever-changing political climate, it is quite fascinating that the problematic
racial representations found in this 2009-feature, could be compared to the films released
during the 1990s. Similarly to Lilo & Stitch, much will therefore be said about this
particular feature that clearly strays from the general progression (associated with the
earlier films), and consequently questions the aforementioned hypothesis. The two
following films do, however, seem to agree with the hypothesis, as Big Hero 6 and Moana
might be regarded as two of the most progressive films included in this study.
The complexity of the films, as well as the varying issues found within them,
makes it difficult to simply rank them based on how progressive they are in terms of racial
50

and ethnic portrayals. While Aladdin clearly is more problematic than Lilo & Stitch, it is
still not entirely fair to argue that The Princess and the Frog is less problematic than The
Lion King, due to the varying extent and gravity of the problems and criticism associated
with these films (i.e. while the former has been widely criticized, the issues found in the
latter are clearly more offensive). However, for the sake of a more general overview, the
analyzed films have still been given a certain label, based on what so far has been said
about their portrayal of ethnic and racial minorities. These labels range from “a very
problematic portrayal” to “a very fair portrayal”, and the general progression of Disney’s
ethnic and racial portrayals can consequently be found in the table below. While this is a
somewhat subjective, as well as a very much simplified summary of what has been treated
in this thesis so far, it might still provide a general visual overview that might be useful
when evaluating and discussing how Disney’s portrayal of race and ethnicity has changed
over time. It is, however, important to point out that this particular graph is far from the
answer to the question regarding Disney’s changing portrayals of race and ethnicity, and
merely an instrument for analysis and discussion.

While a general progress can be seen here, there are some feature films (Lilo & Stitch,
The Princess and the Frog, and Moana) that stray from the generally rising line of
progression. The following subchapters will treat the question of this particular
progression, as well as its anomalies, in more detail. By utilizing this table and the resuls
from the analyses, we should now be able to compare the films, and discuss what really
has happened in relation to race, ethnicity and Disney animation over the past three
decades.
51

4.2 Different ethnicities – different portrayals?

Based on what is stated in the previous subchapter and what we see in Table 4, it might
be important to examine the specific demographics and cultures depicted in the different
films more closely. Are some cultures portrayed as more positive than others, and has
there been more backlash in relation to films that portray a specific culture? Many of the
films included in this study portray the same culture or demographic, and a comparison
between these portrayals will be quite interesting here. We begin with the cultures or
demographics that seems to have received the more positive portrayals by Disney, and
move on towards the most problematic representations found in these Disney features.
4.2.1 Polynesians
Based on the earlier analyses and what we see on the general progressiveness scale, the
two films portraying Polynesian people and culture are clearly some of the most
progressive films in this study. That the portrayals of ethnic minorities in Lilo & Stitch
and Moana can be considered as fair might be a result of several factors. The negative
stereotypes found in some of the other films are not as present here, and the filmmakers
seem to have avoided the most common problems found in other Western representations
of Polynesia, such as the notion of the “noble savage”, the representation of the area and
culture through the eyes of a Western protagonist (such as Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe), or
the depiction of the indigenous population as nothing more than a “part of the local
colour” (Leerssen, 2007: 220). One could still wonder how much the specific portrayed
demographic and culture had to do with the reception of these films, when compared to
the cultures and demographics found in the other films. Is the fact that Lilo & Stitch and
Moana have been better received and less criticized for their portrayal ethnic minorities
a result of a generally less stereotyped vision of Polynesia? As seen in Beller and Leerssen
(2007), Polynesia has frequently been portrayed in a European imagological sense, but,
unlike Africa, China or the Middle East, Polynesia has, as mentioned, often been
portrayed as a tropical paradise – not a dark continent or a barbaric wasteland.
Simultaneously, while a clear (positive) exoticism is present in both Lilo & Stitch
and Moana, the films still avoid the othering present in many of the other Disney
productions. Here, there is not as clear a distinction between the good, bad, or comic
52

characters and the way they speak or look, which again could be linked to racial or cultural
profiling. Furthermore, some elements used to enforce the feeling of “the other” in some
of the other films (such as language, musical elements or physical attributes), are here
used in a more positive light. In Lilo & Stitch, both Lilo and Nani, as well as other main
characters, use Hawaiian words and phrases throughout the film, and many of the songs
in Moana are partially sung in both Samoan and Tokelauan. Both heroines of the films
have also been given a slightly different look than the typical Disney princes and
princesses, and do not stand out when compared with the rest of the portrayed population
in the film (such as, for example, the protagonists in Aladdin do).
Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that Moana, the more recent film,
interestingly enough, ended up lower on the earlier progressiveness scale, compared to
its predecessor Lilo & Stitch. It is possible that this mainly is a result of the disneyfication
of Polynesian culture found in Moana, as well as the problematic portrayal of the
character Maui. In Lilo & Stitch, no elements from local legends or religion is used in
Disney’s favor, and that is probably why this particular film works better than its
successor. This issue will be discussed further in the following subchapters.
4.2.2 East Asians
Similarly to the films depicting Polynesian people and culture, no seriously problematic
stereotypes emerge in neither Mulan nor Big Hero 6. In fact, the main problem and the
main source of criticism regarding these films seems to have been Disney’s
westernization, which in the case of Mulan resulted in a certain type of othering.
However, while it might be true that these films made it to the big screen without any
extreme stereotypical characters with caricaturized features or thick accents, the
culturally appropriate linguistic features, such as the ones found in the Polynesian
narratives, are completely left out. No elements of Japanese or Chinese are present in the
songs in Mulan, and the audiences have no idea whether the multicultural Hiro in Big
Hero 6 also is multilingual.
There is still a somewhat large gap between these films, not only in time (with
Mulan’s year of release being 1998 and Big Hero 6’s 2014) but in progressiveness as
well, as the portrayal in Mulan here has been ranked as somewhat problematic, while the
portrayal in Big Hero 6 has been ranked as fair. What does Big Hero 6 then get right, that
Mulan does not? Firstly, we have to acknowledge that Mulan is set in historical China,
53

while Big Hero 6 is set in the fictional Third Space city of San Fransokyo (partially based
on Tokyo). By merging Japanese and American culture, Disney avoided the serious
accusations of westernization that can be found within the main criticism of Mulan. The
status of Big Hero 6 as the more progressive film might actually also be related to the
general Western view of China and Japan – with Japan being more associated with the
West ever since the end of World War Two. In a poll conducted by the BBC World
Service, a generally more positive perception of Japan, in comparison to China, has, not
surprisingly, been given by Western countries.

When looking at the percentages of how people from different Western countries
answered when asked if their perception of China and Japan were mostly positive or
mostly negative (or neutral), it becomes quite clear that many Western countries tend to
have a more positive view of Japan, while a more negative view of China simultaneously
exists. It is consequently not too far-fetched to assume that a generally negative opinion
of a culture or country might result in some biased, unconscious choices with unfortunate
consequences, such as the othering in Mulan. In relation to the representation of China in
the imagological sense, Schweiger argues the following:
Alternating between Sinophilia and Sinophobia, to the present day the
European image of China has reflected not actual facts, but historically
varying perceptions and shifting cultural self-conceptions among
Europeans.
(Schweiger, 2007: 126)
A slight mixture of Sinophobia and Western self-conceptions might arguably be the
reason for Mulan’s shortcomings. While China might have been portrayed in a more
negative light by Disney, Japan has, on the other hand, been treated a bit differently. Japan
54

has generally, according to Littlewood (2007), been seen as “a natural antithesis to the
West” (2007: 200) from the very start. This antithesis was, however, somewhat
problematic, due to the fact that the strong established Japanese culture “undermined the
most reassuring antithesis of all: civilized European versus primitive savage” (2007: 200).
Japan has, in other words, since the very beginning, been perceived more respectfully
than China in the West. This seems to be the case with Mulan and Big Hero 6 as well. No
Japanese values are contrasted or dismissed in favor of Western values in Big Hero 6, and
the Japanese elements in the film never affects the characters in a negative way.
In conclusion, one could argue that while the Japanese culture and demographic
generally seems to have been portrayed in a more positive light than the Chinese
counterparts, East Asian population and culture in general are still not as positively
depicted in Disney’s films as Polynesians. Nonetheless, they still receive a more fair
portrayal than the remaining main ethnicities found in these films; African Americans
and Arabs.
4.2.3 African Americans
As seen in the historical overview earlier in this thesis, the representation of African
Americans in Disney’s films has always been somewhat problematic. That this issue still
remains partially unchanged can mainly be seen through the analyses of both The Lion
King and The Princess and the Frog, as well as their low position on the progressiveness
scale in the earlier graph. While there clearly was more to be said about The Princess and
the Frog in the previous chapter, it could still be regarded as the more progressive of the
two films, in terms of the portrayal of African Americans. Issues such as the clear racial
stereotyping in the case of the hyenas in The Lion King is actually not present in The
Princess and the Frog, and the latter does arguably portray the racial minority in a
somewhat fair way. The protagonist Tiana is not a lazy, free-loading outcast like the
hyenas, but an ambitious, kind, and hard-working woman. However, while Disney did
manage to portray some positive African-American characters, other issues found in the
film still remain problematic. This is somewhat strange as Disney really tried to make this
particular portrayal as progressive and culturally sensitive as possible, due to their
controversial history regarding their portrayal of African Americans.
The criticism regarding both of these films is, in a way, “closer to home” as
Disney, an American corporation, here portrays an American demographic. African55

American history and the inequalities associated with this demographic might also make
these portrayals more controversial and emotionally charged. The earlier mentioned,
complex criticism regarding Eddie Murphy’s portrayal of Mushu the dragon in Mulan
could be seen as an example of this. While some might claim that this was a case of racial
stereotyping, others might simply see this as a casting choice. Would it have been better
to cast and portray Mushu as Caucasian, to avoid criticism? In Multiculturalism and the
Mouse, Brode discusses the aforementioned crows in Dumbo (criticized for feeding into
stereotypes about African Americans), and argues the following:
The only way in which the issue of ethnic caricaturing could have been
averted would have been for Disney to not include blacks. That would have
opened the film – and Walt – to the criticism of ignoring the African
American subculture. A nonblack artist finds himself in a no-win situation,
damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t.
(Brode, 2005: 52-53)
While this argument in itself is quite problematic when put into the context of what really
could be considered as racism in Dumbo, it does become somewhat central in the case
with Mushu, but also when discussing The Princess and the Frog. Very few AfricanAmerican characters existed in the Disney universe before this film, and many looked
forward to seeing Disney’s first African-American princess on the big screen. This was a
big step for Disney, but the film was still wildly criticized. Again, would it have been
better if Disney had not tried to make an African-American fairytale in the first place?
On the other hand, Giroux does question the reasons for Disney making this film
in the first place:
[I]t is difficult not to be cynical about what appears to be less a tribute to
African American culture than a barely disguised attempt to round out the
Disney Princess market base by targeting young black girls who may find
Tiana dolls and products less alienating than the current Princess options
(five white princesses and an Arab one).
(Giroux, 2010: 123)
While it is difficult to know whether Disney’s first African-American fairytale was made
in the name of progress or merchandising, it is, in any case, quite clear that the filmmakers
would not deliberately include these problematic issues in a film such as this. It is
therefore also difficult to find an explanation to the backlash of The Princess and the Frog
other than a certain underlying (or unconscious) racism still present in Disney
56

filmmaking. It would be naïve to ignore the fact that the people mainly in charge of these
particular Disney films have been white Caucasian males, and many of the later criticized
issues found in The Princess and the Frog is most likely unintentional (or ignorant)
mistakes made or overlooked by these filmmakers. The impact the directors have had on
these films will, as mentioned, be discussed in more detail further on.
4.2.4 Arabs
Arabs probably represent the ethnicity that has received the most problematic portrayal
in the Disney films included in this study. Aladdin is therefore, as mentioned, the product
that we turn to as a starting point, when we analyze change in Disney’s portrayals of racial
and ethnic minorities. The problematic nature of this film has already been discussed in
the earlier analysis, and the issues found within the film agree well with the traditional
stereotypical view of the Middle East (or “the Orient”), described by Leerssen as “premodern, suave, dignified, sensuous and ruthless” (Leerssen, 2007: 95). Unlike some of
the issues found in the other films included in this study, many of the problems in Aladdin
are inexcusably racist, and would probably not appear in a Disney film today. While a
comparison with a more modern Disney film that depicts Arabs would have been
interesting, Aladdin is unfortunately the only film included in this study that portrays this
particular demographic. To find out what a Disney film set in the Middle East would look
like today, one could technically turn to the 2019 live-action version of Aladdin.
However, as this film is a live-action remake with the same story and characters, as well
as a product of Walt Disney Studios (which consequently makes it irrelevant for this
study), this comparison would still not be quite fair.
4.2.5 Concluding remarks on the different ethnicities in Disney films
As can be seen in this subchapter, a certain difference between the treatment of different
ethnicities and cultures does exist. The way Lilo & Stitch and The Princess and the Frog
deviated from the generally rising line of progression in the earlier graph could partially
be explained based on the racial and ethnic minorities these films respectively represent.
Lilo & Stitch, a film focusing on the demographic that seems to have received a more fair
portrayal in media and literature in general, placed itself on the top of the graph, and could
be considered as more progressive than its predecessors. The Princess and the Frog, on
57

the other hand, portrays a demographic generally portrayed quite negatively, and
consequently placed itself quite far below the other films of its time, in terms of
progressiveness and cultural sensitivity. One could, in other words, conclude that while
Disney’s film making generally is becoming more culturally sensitive with time, there
are still certain ethnicities that Disney might find more difficult to handle.
The ranking of the third anomaly found in the graph, Moana, as one of the most
progressive films in this study can also be explained based on what has been said in this
subchapter. However, the fact that the most recent film analyzed in this thesis still only is
the third most progressive film according to the graph in Table 4 does raise some
questions. There are consequently other factors that might have contributed to Moana’s
status as less progressive than Big Hero 6 (which was released two years earlier). These
factors, which might be applied to the other films as well, will be discussed in the
following subchapter.

4.3 The effect of style and popularity

Interestingly enough, when examining the graph in Table 4 closer, a certain correlation
between the films’ position on the scale, and the specific style or genre of these films can,
in fact, be seen. This subchapter is thus reserved for discussing the different types of films
we have been dealing with, to be able to determine whether there are any significant
correlations between genre and style, and the way race and ethnicity have been portrayed
in the films. Finally, we also have to consider the popularity of these films. Are the more
popular films more likely to be criticized, as more people see and discuss them?
When referring to films such as Disney’s animated feature films (i.e. commercial
or popular feature films), Barry Keith Grant (2007) uses the term genre movies. These are
films that, “through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters
in familiar situations” (2007: 17) – a definition that agrees well with Wasko’s (2001)
earlier demonstrated formula for the classic Disney film. With Disney’s influential status
in today’s society, and the many films that have been released in the last ninety years, one
could almost regard the Disney film as a sub-genre of the genre movie. However, in a
similar fashion as other popular films, Disney’s animated features can also be regarded
as belonging to certain sub-genres, which in turn might have a significant effect on how
a demographic or culture is portrayed in a Disney film.
58

4.3.1 Problematic musicals
Many of the films included in this study have often been defined as musical films, and
some of the animated features, such as Aladdin and The Lion King, have even become
immensely popular Broadway musicals. A musical could simply be described as a
production “characteristically sentimental and amusing in nature, with a simple but
distinctive plot, and offering music, dancing, and dialogue” (Encyclopædia Britannica,
2019). Based on this description, the analyzed films that clearly can be considered as
musicals are thus Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, The Princess and the Frog, and Moana.
The characters in these films might unquestionably burst into song and dance, and many
of the musical pieces are used to move the story forward. Interestingly enough, these films
have been regarded as the least progressive films included in this study, with Aladdin
being the film placed at the bottom of the graph in Table 4, and Moana, the most
progressive of the musical films in this study, having only a somewhat fair portrayal of
racial and ethnic minorities. According to Warren Hoffman, the author of The Great
White Way: Race and the Broadway Musical (2014), it seems as if theatrical musicals
have had similar problems relating to portrayals of race and ethnicity as Disney’s films.
Issues such as an overreliance on stereotypes for comedic purposes and a simplification
of certain matters are present in both mediums, and many aspects of the Disney films
analyzed in this study make sense in the light of Hoffman’s arguments. Hoffman does,
for example, comment on a certain rewriting of history that has sometimes occurred in
theatrical musicals.
The Broadway musical, after all, is about America, but it’s an imaginary
America, one in which the country’s real problems—poverty, social
inequality, racism, and misogyny—often disappear.
(Hoffman, 2014: 7)
This argument closely resembles what has been said about The Princess and the Frog, as
well as the earlier discussed Song of the South. One could therefore argue that the style
of this particular genre partially might contribute to the negative way in which race and
ethnicity has been portrayed in certain Disney’s films. The main goal of the musical is
also arguably to entertain, which the directors, producers or filmmakers seemingly try to
achieve at the cost of fair portrayals of ethnic and racial minorities (Hoffmann, 2014).

59

Furthermore, it does, in fact, seem as if the Disney musical generally has been the
most popular type of Disney film. The films released during the successful Disney
Renaissance all belong to the musical genre, while the films from the less successful PostRenaissance era all deter from the musical formula. The popularity of the Disney musical
can also be seen based on the fact that only two non-musical feature films passed the
popularity requirement for being included in this study. The fact that these two films, Lilo
& Stitch and Big Hero 6, a sci-fi and a superhero narrative, simultaneously placed
themselves at the top of the graph in Table 4, also strengthens the argument of Disney
musicals being more problematic in terms of the depiction of race and ethnicity. One
could therefore argue that Disney’s preference of musical films, and the negative racial
and ethnic portrayals they tend to include, might be one of the reasons why Disney has
been more criticized than, for example, DreamWorks Animation – an American
animation studio with a majority of non-musical films.
While arguments for Lilo & Stitch and Big Hero 6 being more progressive already
have been made, one could assume that the non-musical style of these films also made it
“easier” for the filmmakers to avoid the common stereotypes and the problematic style
that we tend to see in musicals. In a Disney musical that focuses on a minority
demographic or a different culture, everything in the film usually revolves around the
portrayed demographic or culture. There are elements from this culture everywhere: the
music is local, the people are eating local food, the villain has a local backstory, and
Disney makes sure that you really know where this film is set. In the non-musicals, the
setting is necessarily nothing more than a setting. In summary, a Disney musical might
generally be more likely to have a more problematic portrayal of race and ethnicity, than
a Disney film belonging to a different genre.
4.3.2 Cultural stories disneyfied
While the specific cultures and demographics depicted in the films already have been
discussed, it might still be important to put some focus on the cultural heritage of the
original stories that these films are based on. Disneyfication of traditional fairytales has
been present ever since the 1930s, with the production of Snow White and the Seven
Dwarves – Disney’s first animated feature film, based on the Brothers Grimm fairytale.
That Disney has taken these traditional stories and turned them into blockbuster films is
no news, and Disney’s versions might actually, as Wasko (2001: 113) points out, be better
60

known than the originals. While disneyfication already has been discussed in relation to
some of the analyzed Disney films, it might still be interesting to focus on the amount of
disneyfication these original stories have been subjected to, and how it in turn has affected
the representations of race and ethnicity in the Disney version.
As seen in earlier chapters, the interpretation, alteration, and disneyfication of the
source material have been widely criticized in relation to films such as Mulan and Moana.
Among the entries in this study, these films, together with Aladdin, are the productions
that have taken a traditional story or legend as a base for its narrative, and also chosen its
setting based on this story or legend. These films are, interestingly enough, (here) ranked
as having somewhat problematic, or worse, portrayals of ethnic and racial minorities. The
Lion King and The Princess and the Frog are, again, films based on traditional stories
(Hamlet and The Frog Prince), that do not share settings with the original narratives.
While it is quite interesting that the films with issues relating to the representation of
African Americans have been based on non-African-American stories, it is also worth
pointing out that these films have been ranked as problematic in the earlier graph.
Among all the films included in this study, only one film draws its story from the
filmmakers themselves. This particular film, Lilo & Stitch, is based on an unpublished
story by Chris Sanders, one of the film’s directors. The film is not based on Hawaiian or
Polynesian legends or stories, and Lilo & Stitch is, as mentioned, simultaneously the film
with the fairest portrayal of race and ethnicity included in this study. No demi-gods have
been caricaturized for comic relief, no heroines have been more westernized to better fit
in with Disney’s version of the story, and no questions have been raised regarding
deviations from the original story. One could, consequently, argue that a Disney story
without a strong history or relation to a specific culture, while simultaneously dealing
with the same culture, is less prone to criticism. This could also be true for Big Hero 6, a
film that in fact is based on another story, but not necessarily a story as culturally loaded
as folk stories or cultural legends. Big Hero 6 might, in other words, be ranked higher in
the earlier graph due to its somewhat neutral source material.
Regarding popularity, it is again important to point out that it, in fact, is the films
based on traditional stories or legends that arguably tend to be more popular. Many of the
films from Disney’s Post-Renaissance Era that did not pass the popularity criteria (e.g.
Dinosaur [2000], The Emperor’s New Groove [2000], Brother Bear [2003], Home on the
Range [2004], and Bolt [2008]) are, in fact, screenplays with original stories.

61

4.3.3 Concluding remarks on style and popularity
Based on what has been stated in this subchapter, it is quite clear that the style and genre
of a Disney film seems to have an effect on its racial and ethnic portrayals. In addition to
the varying amount of cultural sensitivity associated with specific cultures, the anomalies
seen in the progressiveness graph in Table 4 can consequently be explained by this. The
specific style and genre of Moana – a musical film based on a Polynesian legend – could,
for example, explain this film’s status as less progressive than Big Hero 6 – a non-musical
superhero narrative based on a comic book. It seems as if the grand Disney musicals or
fairytales, such as Moana, have been the most criticized, but at the same time the most
popular Disney features. All films included in this study are clearly popular, but based on
their ratings and their initial box-office revenue, Aladdin, The Lion King, Big Hero 6 and
Moana could arguably be seen as the most popular of all the films included in this study.
It is, therefore, still quite difficult to argue that the most popular Disney films tend to be
the productions most prone to criticism, since, for example, Big Hero 6 is one of the least
criticized films included in this study, while The Princess and the Frog – the least popular
film according to the popularity criteria – again is one of the most criticized of the
aforementioned productions.
It is, in other words, quite evident that it is the genre, the style, and the source
material for the film (and necessarily not its popularity) that might affect how well ethnic
and racial minorities are portrayed (or perceived) in a Disney feature.

4.4 Making a culturally sensitive Disney feature

We now know how the portrayals of race and ethnicity in Disney have changed over time,
and what the reasons behind the progressiveness of their racial and ethnic portrayals might
be. It is, however, still important to briefly discuss how these films have been made, and
where the creative and artistic responsibility lies, especially when we look at films such
as The Princess and the Frog, where Disney actually tried to do something right, but
much still went wrong. Who are the directors of the films and what have they had to say
about the criticism regarding the racial and ethnic portrayals? Which films are associated
with focus groups and research trips, and how well were they received in relation to films
without this kind of preparatory work?
62

4.4.1 The directors’ impact
As mentioned earlier in this thesis, a director could, in fact, be seen as the author of a
certain film. An animated feature film does, however, involve many people and we have
already acknowledged the problem with holding a certain director solely responsible for
an animated Disney film. There is, nevertheless, a quite clear and established view of
what the duties and the responsibilities of a film director are. The directors are involved
in most parts of the filmmaking progress; they read and edit scripts, they make general
creative and technical choices, and they work with both actors and editors to produce the
film as they envisioned it. While the executives and board members of the Disney studios
might have the final say when it comes to its films, as there are cases where Disney has
fired directors due to creative differences (see e.g. Cavna, 2017), the directors are still
arguably the biggest creative force behind the film. As a result, it is important to (at least
briefly) acknowledge their involvement, and discuss whether some stereotypical or
progressive portrayals of race and ethnicity can be linked to the directors themselves.
Among all the directors of the analyzed films in this study, two particular directors
are involved with more projects than the others. Ron Clements and John Musker have
already been described as Disney veterans in this thesis, and rightfully so. Besides
Aladdin, The Princess and the Frog, and Moana, Musker and Clements also directed The
Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Hercules (1997), and
Treasure Planet (2002). These are some of the most popular Walt Disney Animation
Studios films, and the features by Clements and Musker that made it into this study are,
interestingly enough, also some of the most criticized films in terms of racial and ethnic
portrayals. It is, however, again worth pointing out the unfairness of blaming the
problematic ethnic and racial portrayals solely on the directors themselves. A certain
preferred style by Musker and Clements is, in fact, quite easily distinguished, as many of
their films have been Disney musicals based on a non-American source material. These
are two factors earlier established in this thesis as generally resulting in less progressive
and more simplistic portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities. It is also worth mentioning
that no criticism towards Clements and Musker’s personal take on race and ethnicity
(similar to that of Walt Disney’s) seems to exist, and (as seen in bonus features included
in the home-releases of their films) the directors generally seem interested in creating
films that positively deal with different people and cultures. While it would be interesting
to see how other directors’ general progressiveness changes on the graph in Table 4,
63

compared to that of Clements and Musker, the latter two are, unfortunately, the only
directors that have directed several features included in this study. Nevertheless, the
earlier argument regarding a move towards a generally more culturally sensitive film
industry can still be seen when focusing solely on the films by Clements and Musker.
It is also quite difficult to find any specific opinions on diversity or
multiculturalism (either for or against) that the other directors associated with the films
in this study have expressed. However, based on the fact that these directors genuinely
seem passionate about these films that deal with foreign cultures and minorities (as can
be seen when examining interviews and bonus material included DVD and Blu-Ray
releases of the films), it would be quite farfetched to assume that these people
discriminates or show prejudice against minorities in their spare time. Nevertheless, it is
definitely worth repeating the fact that all the directors of the films included in this study
have been exclusively American Caucasian males. Disney has generally been criticized
for this particular issue, and one could only wonder what the films that feature minority
characters would have looked like with a director that share the same culture or ethnicity.
4.4.2 Preparatory research and focus groups
To get a better understanding of the people, the cultures, and the traditions presented in
these films, the Disney filmmakers have often still tried to familiarize themselves with
the portrayed culture before making the feature films. Directors and crew have conducted
research trips to the areas in which the films will be set, and various focus groups have
been created and consulted throughout the filmmaking processes. Some of these instances
have already been mentioned briefly, and a more thorough discussion of Disney’s efforts,
and its relation to the outcome of the film, will consequently be discussed here.
There is clearly a correlation between the preparatory research and familiarization
with the portrayed cultures or demographics, and the progressiveness of the final portrayal
of the same culture or demographic in Disney’s films. It is, for example, almost
impossible to find any information about Disney’s preparatory work in relation to Aladdin
and The Lion King – probably because none existed – and the portrayal of Arabs and
Africa (as well as African Americans) in the films consequently turned out to be quite
problematic. Disney could probably have avoided a great deal of criticism with both
Aladdin and The Lion King if audiences that belong to the portrayed demographics had
been consulted prior to the film releases.
64

When examining interviews featured in the bonus material on the home-releases
of the Disney films, it is not before we get to Mulan that we start hearing words such as
“research trip”. The filmmakers behind this particular feature spent three weeks in China,
to familiarize themselves with the culture and get inspired. While one could argue that
three weeks is a very short time to familiarize oneself with a culture to then be able to
fairly portray it to a Western audience, this research trips was arguably still a bigger effort
than what was made in relation to the cultural portrayal in Aladdin or The Lion King. Lilo
& Stitch did arguably receive a similar treatment in terms of preparatory research.
Directors Sanders and DeBlois also took a three-week research trip to Hawaii, but unlike
the trip done in relation to the production of Mulan, the story of Lilo & Stitch actually
seems to have been affected by Hawaiian values, as the entire theme of ‘ohana (family)
present throughout the film was a direct result of what the directors saw and heard during
this research trip (Harada, 2002). Some of the music in this film is also, as already
mentioned, composed and performed by Hawaiian artist Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu, and the
film makers actually consulted local voice actors Tia Carrere and Jason Scot Lee, who
rewrote some of their lines to make them more local and culturally appropriate.
The Princess and the Frog was, as mentioned, criticized already prior to its
release, and Disney took various efforts not to disappoint its audiences. Consequently,
early versions of the film was shown to African-American audiences, after which many
problematic elements of the film had to be changed. Nevertheless, focus groups consisting
of these appropriate audiences were actually consulted, which is something that had not
really happened in the earlier released films included in this study. However, rather than
including these focus groups throughout the filmmaking process, it seems as if they rather
were presented with a somewhat finished product, which then was edited according to
some of the criticism. More pressing issues, such as the change of the protagonist’s name
Maddy (which sounded too much like “mammy”) to Tiana, as well as her profession from
a chambermaid to a waitress (McCoy Gregory, 2010), appear to have gotten the main
focus during these sessions, and issues such as the questionable location and time period
might not have been on the top of agenda. In the defense of Clements and Musker, it
seems as if Louisiana and New Orleans actually was chosen based on the location’s
magical qualities and former chief creative officer John Lasseter’s love for the city.
Unfortunate (supposed) mistakes such as this problematic combination of the film’s
spatial and temporal setting might still have been avoided by giving the test screenings
more time and including the focus groups more thoroughly in the creative process.
65

Interestingly enough, not much information can be found on the preliminary
research regarding Japanese culture in relation to Big Hero 6. In all fairness, this is a film
that mixes two cultures, and one could ask oneself if there is a correct way to portray a
San Fransokyo (i.e. partly American) family with both Caucasian and mixed-race
members. With or without extensive preliminary research, Big Hero 6 still ranks as one
of the most progressive films included in this study.
Clements and Musker’s most recent film, Moana, does, however seem to be the
Disney film associated with the most extensive preliminary research. The filmmaking
progress began back in 2011, when the directors wrote a pitch for chief creative officer
Lasseter, who, in turn, asked them to conduct a research trip to Polynesia before moving
on with the project. During their research trip, Musker and Clements familiarized
themselves with the cultures and traditions of Polynesia; this is how the element of
wayfinding found its way into the film, and as the directors eventually understood
importance of the ocean in Polynesian culture, the ocean actually became its own
character in the film. While preparing for and making the film, Disney also founded the
Oceanic Story Trust, which consisted of Polynesian linguists, historians, artists and other
indigenous people from the region. The Oceanic Story Trust seems to have been involved
throughout the filmmaking progress and the story eventually evolved through nine
versions (Ito, 2016). Some culturally inappropriate or problematic issues, such as Maui
being portrayed as bald and Moana venting her anger by throwing coconuts, were taken
out of the film as a result of the comments made by the members of the Oceanic Story
Trust (Robinson, 2016), but some issues introduced by the filmmakers, such as the earlier
criticized coconut pirates (the Kakamora) and the representation of Maui as “very flawed,
but very likeable” (Giardina, 2016), remained. Similarly to what we see in the more recent
films included in this study, most of the cast was also of Polynesian decent.
4.4.3 Concluding remarks on the making of a Disney feature
Due to the commercialism that surrounds Disney, it is quite clear that some of the more
problematic issues found in some of the analyzed films might have been unintentional or
ignorant mistakes made by the filmmakers. While the aforementioned focus groups
certainly have had a positive impact on the final products, it is still the filmmakers that
make the final decisions, and some issues found by test audiences and focus groups might
therefore still remain in the film to achieve a certain desired effect (such as Western
66

relatability or comic relief). It is, in other words, clear that certain stereotypes therefore
still prevail in these films, and it is possible that a larger amount of creative responsibility
to the focus groups or (even better) a director that actually belongs to the minority
depicted in the film would result in less stereotyped and westernized portrayals.
In summary, with all parts of this entire chapter in mind, it is ultimately the
filmmakers responsibility to give an appropriate and un-biased portrayal of the different
cultures in their films, but this can simultaneously be a somewhat difficult task due to the
material they are working with (e.g. folklore from foreign cultures), as well as the desired
format (e.g. an easily understood musical) of the final product. It is, however, clear that
Disney generally is trying (and succeeds) to move towards a more progressive and
culturally sensitive film era, all while factors such as style, genre, source material and the
general attitude towards the culture surely still might result in some of the Disney feature
films placing themselves below the generally rising progression line in the graph
presented earlier in this chapter.

67

5. Conclusion

With all that has been stated in this thesis in mind, how has the portrayal of racial and
ethnic minorities I films released by Walt Disney Animation Studios changed over time?
We begin with Aladdin, a film filled with stereotypes, othering, and other clearly racist
elements – a very problematic entrance on this list. We continue with The Lion King, a
film that generally could be considered as non-racist, save for a few quite offensive
instances, although only present in parts of the animated feature. This still renders The
Lion King as a problematic film, in terms of the portrayal of ethnic and racial minorities.
This entrance is again followed by an only somewhat problematic portrayal in Mulan.
This is a film without any clear racism, and a feature that many even would consider as
quite progressive. Nevertheless, the westernization of the traditional Chinese ballad does
lead to some othering, and the disneyfication consequently receives some criticism. As
we move on to Lilo & Stitch, we get to what could be considered as the most progressive
film included in this study, only to move on to the again problematic 2009-feature The
Princess and the Frog. While the latter is free from any clear-cut racism, similar to that
present in some of the earlier Disney films, many of the questionable creative choices
made by the filmmakers still put Disney’s first and only African-American princess in a
different category than the company’s earlier royal characters. The Disney Revival brings
us two more films on the more culturally-sensitive side, but a clear rise in progressiveness
can still not be seen between Big Hero 6 and Moana, as the latter could be seen as more
problematic than the former.
To sum up, the representations of race and ethnicity in Disney’s films are
becoming more progressive and culturally sensitive, but the altogether rising line of
progressiveness does have its deviations, both in the more positive and negative direction.
The reasons for these deviations have also been discussed in this thesis, and it has been
argued that the source material and the general style of the film, in fact, might be the some
of the forces behind the progressiveness or cultural insensitivity of an animated Disney
feature film. For instance, based on what is discussed in Chapter 4.3, an animated Disney
musical based on a culturally-specific folktale or legend tends to include more offensive
or problematic portrayals of the culture, race, or ethnicity of focus. Nevertheless, due to
their status as a global producer of animated content, it is somewhat obvious that the Walt
68

Disney Animation Studios make efforts to improve their racial and ethnic portrayals, as
can be seen with the aforementioned research trips made by the filmmakers in preparation
for making the film, as well as the focus groups consulted during the filmmaking progress.
However, it still remains unclear whether these newly taken measures by Disney
demonstrate a genuine attempt at becoming more diverse and culturally sensitive in their
filmmaking, or if this simply are attempts to avoid possible criticism and accusations of
othering, stereotyping and westernization.
Furthermore, while a certain rise in progressiveness here has been established by
analyzing the relevant films for this study, it is still unclear whether contemporary Disney
has been more or less progressive than other Western film studios, as this was not
explored in this study (save for a brief comparison with DreamWorks in Chapter 4.3.1).
This thesis could serve as material for a study focusing on just that. Disney has, as
mentioned, received its fair share of criticism for stereotypical portrayals, but is Disney
the only company that receives this sort of criticism? Or are we, the audience and the
consumers, more likely to forgive other studios for similar problems as Disney have
made, due to the fact that this particular studio and company is associated with childhood
and innocence? This study could also be extended further by comparing the here analyzed
animated feature films with some of their recently released live-action counterparts. At
the time of writing this thesis, Walt Disney Studios have already released and begun
production on live-action adaptations of various Disney classics. Among the animated
features analyzed in this study, Aladdin and The Lion King already received live-action
counterparts in 2019, while a corresponding version of Mulan is set to be released in 2020.
As even a live-action adaptation of Lilo & Stitch, as mentioned, currently is on its way, it
would not be surprising if the other films analyzed in this study will get similar
adaptations in the future. While the Walt Disney Animation Studios and the Walt Disney
Studios are two different branches of the company, it would still be interesting to see
whether Disney (here again used as an umbrella term for “everything Disney”) is trying
to correct the problematic issues found in the original animated films by recasting roles
and changing certain elements that were criticized in the original versions. As an example,
the already altered but yet offensive lyrics of Aladdin’s “Arabian Nights” was changed a
second time for the live-action version for the film.
Still, no matter how many remakes of the animated Disney classics the company
decide to make, the original versions will still remain relevant for a long time. It is, as
mentioned in the very beginning of this thesis, almost impossible to avoid Disney’s
69

productions entirely, and it is quite safe to assume that most people (at least in the Western
World) have seen at least one animated feature film by Disney. Due to their relevance,
global reach, and, chiefly, young audience, these films have an immense impact on our
lives and the way we view the world. I would therefore, once more, argue that analyses,
such as this one, have significant value. Keeping in mind the socio-political climate
during the releases of some of these films, one does not necessarily have to boycott all of
Disney’s productions due to their sometimes problematic or even offensive nature, but it
is important to acknowledge that a great deal of stereotypes, in fact, can be found in these
animated classics. I personally grew up with many of Disney’s animated feature films,
and while I probably would not recommend Aladdin to anyone today without providing
some context regarding its racist nature, I would still be lying if I said that I did not enjoy
watching some of the films (even as an adult) as I analyzed them. However, my
admiration, or even love, for these animated classics should still not prevent me from
criticizing them for some of their problematic, stereotypical or even racist elements.
Disney has improved in terms of fair ethnic and racial representation, but the company
and the studios still have a long way to go. Disney – a company associated with childhood,
magic, and innocence – is, after all, not that innocent.

6. Summary in Swedish – svensk sammanfattning

Animerade stereotyper – en analys av Disneys framställning av ras och etnicitet

6.1 Introduktion

The Walt Disney Company har skapat animerade filmer ända sedan 1920-talet, och
företaget är i dagsläget en av de största filmproducenterna i världen. Det är dock ironiskt
att ett så till synes oskyldigt och familjekärt företag som Disney i så stor utsträckning har
kritiserats för sina filmers rasistiska och sexistiska innehåll. Många kritiker och
akademiker har ansett att Disney och företagets filmskapare inte alltid lyckats vara
speciellt kulturellt medvetna eller känsliga, och företaget liksom dess produktioner har
utgjort en utgångspunkt för många kritiska analyser och studier. Disneys äldre filmer
kritiseras än idag för både tydligt och underliggande rasistiskt innehåll, och även flera av
företagets modernare filmer har väckt starkt negativa känslor hos många tittare. Medan
somliga påstår att Disney nog blivit progressiverare med tiden, hävdar andra att de
problematiska framställningarna kvarstår och att speciellt den underliggande rasismen
fortfarande framkommer tydligt (se t.ex. Breaux, 2010).
Denna studie kommer att fokusera på representationen av ras och etnicitet i Walt
Disney Animation Studios modernare tecknade långfilmer. Utgående från en kvalitativ
samt komparativ analys av sju, för min avhandling lämpliga filmer hoppas jag kunna
skapa en bild av Disneys samtida representation av ras, etnicitet och kultur, samt definiera
hur Disneys representationer har förändrats med tiden. Somliga kanske anser att
diskussionen kring kultur- och rasfrågor inom media har gått för långt och att kritiker
nuförtiden söker efter problem som egentligen inte existerar – speciellt med tanke på den
negativa klang som begreppet ”politisk korrekthet” har fått under de senaste åren. Jag
hävdar däremot att kritik och analys av denna typ är otroligt viktig, speciellt när
målgruppen för det kritiserade materialet består av barn och ungdomar, som till en stor
del påverkas av film och media (Hurley, 2005). Disneys filmer påverkar oss mer än vi
anar, och med denna forskning hoppas jag kunna bidra med medvetenhet och kännedom
inom detta område.
71

6.2 Material, metod och teori

Med tanke på den otroligt stora mängden filmer som Walt Disney Animation Studios har
producerat kan det dock vara svårt att begränsa en studie som denna. Jag har därför valt
att endast fokusera på populära samt för temat relevanta filmer som kommit ut efter 1989.
Filmerna som uppfyllde dessa krav var Aladdin (1992), Lejonkungen (The Lion King,
1994), Mulan (1998), Lilo & Stitch (2002), Prinsessan och grodan (The Princess and the
Frog, 2009), Big Hero 6 (2014) samt Vaiana (Moana, 2016). Med dessa sju filmer som
utgångspunkt försöker jag alltså besvara frågan:
1) Hur framställer Walt Disney Animation Studios ras och etnicitet i sina animerade
långfilmer?
Utgående från analysen av de sju valda filmerna hoppas jag även kunna hitta svar på
följande fråga:
2) Hur har Walt Disney Animation Studios framställning av ras och etnicitet ändrat
med tiden?
Med ras och etnicitet syftar jag här främst på ras- och befolkningsminoriteter i
västvärlden. Framställningarna av dessa minoriteter i de valda filmerna kommer med
andra ord först att analyseras skilt och sedan jämföras med varandra. På detta sätt hoppas
jag kunna förklara hur (och om) dessa framställningar har ändrat med tiden.
Denna studie är en fortsättning på min kandidatavhandling från 2015, i vilken jag
försökte besvara liknande frågor som dessa, dock med en betydligt mindre mängd
material och resurser. Utgående från min analys av Aladdin och Prinsessan och grodan
hävdade jag att Disney i allmänhet gjort positiva framsteg angående sina framställningar
av ras- och befolkningsminoriteter, men att företaget trots detta fortfarande kunde göra
mycket för att trovärdigt och respektfullt framställa dessa grupper och deras kulturer. Den
tydliga rasismen i filmerna har försvunnit, men stereotyper och problematiska
representationer kvarstår. De här resultaten fungerar som en preliminär hypotes för denna
pro gradu-avhandling. Emellertid, med tanke på att denna studie fokuserar på sju filmer
istället för två, kan dock de kommande resultaten vara mer varierande i förhållande till de
som dök upp i min kandidatavhandling.
Som sagt existerar redan en hel del forskning med fokus på just detta ämne. Några
exempel på detta är Byrne och McQuillans Deconstructing Disney (1999), Brodes
72

Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment (2005), samt
Giroux The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence (2010). Till skillnad
från Giroux samt Byrne och McQuillan som förhåller sig relativt kritiskt till Disney,
försvarar Brode företaget och hävdar att Walt Disney var en av Hollywoods första
filmskapare som rättvist och positivt framställde minoriteter i sina filmer. Dessa olika
ställningstaganden, i kombination med kritiska artiklar med fokus på de sju valda
filmerna, kommer att tas i beaktande under kommande analys och diskussion.
De valda filmerna kommer att analyseras utgående från bland annat imagologi och
postkolonial teori. Beller och Leerssen (2007) definierar imagologi som studien om den
allmänna uppfattningen om folkgrupper och nationaliteter – eller, med andra ord, studien
om stereotyper. Deras verk Imagology: The cultural construction and literary
representation of national characters: A critical survey innehåller flera kritiska artiklar
med fokus på de vanligaste stereotyperna om olika folkslag, vilka kommer vara väldigt
användbara under analysen av Disneys ras- och befolkningsframställningar. Postkolonial
teori fokuserar däremot specifikt på västvärldens representation av östvärlden. Inom detta
område dyker bland annat koncept som Den Andre (the Other) upp. Detta fenomen,
myntat av bland annat Edward Said i hans verk Orientalism (1978), beskriver en process
där något eller någon som skiljer sig från en själv beskrivs som avvikande, konstigt, eller
negativt. På detta sätt skapas ett starkt vi-och-dem-tänkande, och flera forskare har
kritiserat Disney för just denna form av representation. Förutom dessa två teorier kommer
även begreppet ”disnifikation” (egen översättning av ”disneyfication”) att dyka upp i
samband med analyserna. Janet Wasko (2001) beskriver disnifikation som processen där
något disnifieras. Disney baserar ofta sina filmer på redan existerande folksagor eller
kulturella legender och myter, men framställer en egen tolkning av dessa berättelser som
bättre lämpar sig för en ung amerikansk publik. Majoriteten av filmerna inkluderade i
denna studie är baserade på just denna typ av material, och Disney har följaktligen
kritiserats för att ha feltolkat samt västerniserat (egen översättning av ”westernize”; införa
västerländska ideal eller göra mer västerländskt) flera av dessa ursprungsberättleser.

6.3 Filmanalys

Filmerna analyseras till följande i kronologisk ordning, baserat på åren de kom ut.
Analysen börjar alltså med Aladdin, filmen som utspelar sig i den fiktiva (men tydligt
73

Mellanöstern-inspirerade) staden Agrabah. Denna film har kritiserats hårt på grund av
dess negativa representation av araber och Mellanöstern (se t.ex. Shaheen, 1993).
Araberna framställs som barbarer med mörk hud, stora svarta skägg och en engelska med
tydlig arabisk brytning, samtidigt som Disneys representation av Mellanöstern är fylld av
orientalistiska klichéer och stereotyper, som till exempel flygande mattor och exotiska
magdansare. Denna framställning blir ännu mer problematisk med tanke på att
huvudkaraktärerna (som publiken ska sympatisera med) samtidigt har framställts med
ljusare hudtoner och tydligt amerikanska dialekter. Aladdin och de övriga ”goda”
karaktärerna i Agrabah har med andra ord versterniserats medan Disney här tydligt
framställer araben som Den Andre.
Den följande filmen på listan är Lejonkungen, en av Disneys populäraste filmer
genom tiderna. Intressant nog har även denna Disneyklassiker kritiserats en hel del för
sin framställning av ras- och befolkningsminoriteter, trots att alla karaktärer i filmen är
djur. Enligt bland annat Giroux (2010: 110) framkommer denna problematiska
framställning främst fram i samband med de antagonistiska hyenorna i filmen. Dessa
karaktärer är lata, osympatiska samt från samhället utstötta individer som samtidigt har
framställts med afroamerikanska och latino-dialekter. Även denna gång är ”vi och dem”förhållandet väldigt tydligt, speciellt med tanke på att filmens huvudkaraktärer talar
”standard” engelska. Till skillnad från Aladdin, framställs dock en del av de ”goda”
huvudkaraktärerna

i

Lejonkungen

av

skådespelare

som

hör

till

ras-

och

befolkningsminoriteter, vilket i sin tur kunde ses som ett framsteg i Disneys framställning
av ras och etnicitet (Byrne & McQuillan, 1999: 103).
Fyra år efter Lejonkungen släpptes filmen Mulan. Denna film har kritiserats
betydligt mindre än de två hittills analyserade Disneyklassikerna, och många anser än
idag att Mulan är både progressiv och feministisk (se t.ex. Ward, 2002). Medan detta
verkar vara den allmänna åsikten i västvärlden, kritiserades dock Mulan samtidigt i Kina
för att ha både förvrängt och västerniserat den ursprungliga folkberättelsen om Hua
Mulan (BBC News, 1999). Disneys Mulan bestämmer sig, till exempel, för att ta sin fars
plats i kriget mot hunnerna för att hon (som hon senare i filmen erkänner) vill hitta sig
själv, medan den ursprungliga balladen framhäver de mer kinesiska värderingarna, så som
kollektivism och ära (Ward, 2002: 97-99). Mulan är alltså helt tydligt ett till exempel på
disnifikation samt västernisering, och framställer dessutom Kina som Den Andre, med
tanke på det kontrast som uppstår i samband med Mulans västerländska normbrytningar
i det bakåtsträvande kinesiska samhället.
74

Lilo & Stitch är dock antagligen den mest kulturellt medvetna och känsliga filmen
inkluderad i denna analys. Medan exotiska element som vanligtvis förknippas med
Hawaii (där berättelsen i filmen tar plats) tydligt framhävs i filmen, så görs detta på ett
realistiskt och respektfullt sätt. Ja, huvudkaraktären Lilo dansar hula på sin fritid, men
hon går inte omkring klädd i en hula-kjol hela filmen. Lilo råkar även simma förbi några
delfiner i början av filmen, men delfinen är varken hennes trogne vän eller
transportmedel. Filmskaparna har med andra ord undvikit de typiska (ofta simplifierade)
inslagen som vanligtvis dyker upp i Disneys filmer. Skådespelare från Hawaii framställer
även många av huvudkaraktärerna i denna film, vilket i allmänhet gör Disneys
helhetsrepresentation av kulturen och befolkningen mer trovärdig.
Den följande filmen i tur, Prinsessan och grodan, diskuterades och kritiserades
en hel del redan före den kom ut år 2009, vilket främst var ett resultat av filmens status
som Disneys första prinsessfilm med en afroamerikansk huvudkaraktär. Filmen
kritiserades även efter att den kom ut, delvis för att Disneys första afroamerikanska
prinsessa spenderar cirka två tredjedelar av filmen som en groda. Många kritiker (se t.ex.
Breaux, 2010) ifrågasatte också valet att placera filmens handling i New Orleans på 1920talet, en period starkt associerad med Jim Crow-lagarna och segregationen i USA. Detta
kunde ha varit ett bra tillfälle för Disney att hantera frågor relaterade till ras och
afroamerikansk historia, men filmen går aldrig in på problemen som segregationen
medförde för den afroamerikanska befolkningen, och huvudkaraktären Tiana lever ett
väldigt simpelt och för tiden och platsen orealistiskt liv som inte påverkas av hennes ras
och sociala status. Detta förskönar USA:s historia och förhållande till ras, vilket relaterar
till den underliggande rasismen som diskuterades i början av avhandlingen. Många
liknande problem dök upp i samband med analysen, och flera av Disneys kreativa val kan
verkligen ifrågasättas.
Big Hero 6 skiljer sig dock en hel del från de andra filmerna inkluderade i denna
analys, delvis för att detta är en film som för ovanlighetens skull tydligt hör till den typsika
superhjälte-genren, men även på grund av filmens mer progressiva samt sensitiva
framställning av ras- och befolkningsminoriteter. Huvudkaraktären Hiro och hans bror är
båda blandras japanskamerikaner, men ras eller etnicitet får aldrig desto större
uppmärksamhet i filmen. Till skillnad från Prinsessan och grodan som tog en äkta stad
och tidsperiod som grund för sin iscensättning, utspelar sig Big Hero 6 i den fiktiva staden
San Fransokyo, en modern kombination av San Fransisco och Tokyo. På grund av San
Fransokyos fiktiva natur förblir ras och etnicitet osynligt på ett positivt sätt (vilket inte
75

var fallet i Prinsessan och grodan), och trots att många i denna fiktiva stad tillhör någon
befolkningsminoritet, undviker Disney de typiska stereotyperna som dessa minoriteter
ibland associeras med i andra filmer.
Den sista och modernaste filmen som inkluderades i denna analys är Vaiana, och
liksom Big Hero 6 samt Lilo & Stitch kunde även denna film klassas som en av de mer
progressiva Disneyfilmerna. Vaiana utspelar sig också i Polynesien, och vissa jämförelser
kan därför göras med Lilo & Stitch. I stora drag upprätthåller filmen samma kulturellt
sensitiva och respektfulla framställningar av lokalbefolkningen och kulturen som Lilo &
Stitch, men några problematiska karaktärer och delar dyker dock upp i samband med
analysen. Det mest problematiska inslaget i Vaiana är antagligen framställningen av
karaktären Maui, en halvgud som även existerar i Polynesiska legender och religioner. I
filmen Vaiana är Maui en komisk och bristfällig karaktär, vilket skiljer sig en hel del från
hjälten Maui i polynesiska berättelser, och Disney kritiserades följaktligen för grov
feltolkning av denna halvgud (se t.ex. Rika, 2016).

6.4 Diskussion

Om man enkelt skulle ranka dessa filmer baserat på hur väl och respektfullt de framställer
ras- och befolkningsminoriteter, på ett spektrum från ”en väldigt problematisk
framställning” till ”en väldigt progressiv framställning”, kunde man plavera filmerna i
följande ordning: Aladdin (1992), Lejonkungen (1994), Prinsessan och grodan (2009),
Mulan (1998), Vaiana (2016), Big Hero 6 (2014) och Lilo & Stitch (2002). Utgående från
denna rangordning och åren filmerna kom ut, verkar det som att framställningarna av rasoch befolkningsminoriteter i Disneys filmer nog blir mer kulturellt sensitiva och
progressiva med tiden. Lilo & Stitch, Prinsessan och grodan samt Big Hero 6 avviker
dock från denna med tiden jämnt stigande grad av progressivitet. Det är intressant att Lilo
& Stitch här rankas som den mest progressiva filmen, med tanke på att den kom ut så
tidigt som år 2002. Att Prinsessan och grodan (som kom ut sju år senare) samtidigt rankas
som mer problematisk än flera av dess föregångare är också fascinerande. Medan
kontrasten mellan Big Hero 6 och Vaiana dock inte är lika stor, är det fortfarande värt att
påpeka att Big Hero 6 lyckas bättre i sin minoritetsframställning än sin efterträdare. Dessa
avvikelser, i förhållande till den allmänt stigande progressiviteten bland de övriga
filmerna, kan baseras på olika orsaker som till följande diskuteras i korthet.
76

Först och främst måste den specifika ras- eller befolkningsminoriteten som
representeras i de olika filmerna tas i beaktande. Att hitta en film som framställer araber
i den lägre ändan på progressivitetsskalan är kanske inte så förvånande med tanke på hur
araber och mellanöstern överlag har framställts och fortfarande framställs i västvärlden.
Medan det samma kunde sägas om framställningen av Afrika och Kina, skiljer sig dock
framställningen av Polynesien en aning från dessa tidigare nationaliteter och kulturer.
Polynesien var ett populärt tema i den kolonialistiska litteraturen, och trots att
framställningen av den noble vilden fortfarande dyker upp i modernare verk, verkar
Polynesien ändå allmänt associeras med positivare attribut än de övriga områdena och
kulturerna som dyker upp i denna analys. För västvärlden är Polynesien framför allt ett
tropiskt paradis, och det är antagligen delvis också därför som Lilo & Stitch och Vaiana
här

rankats

som

filmer

med

positivare

representationer

av

ras-

och

befolkningsminoriteter. Framställningen av afroamerikaner i film, media och litteratur
har dock länge varit problematisk, och många negativa skildringar existerar fortfarande,
vilket vi delvis ser i samband med Prinsessan och grodan.
En annan aspekt i frågan om vilka filmer som lyckats eller misslyckats med sina
framställningar av ras och etnicitet har att göra med genre och stil. Majoriteten av Walt
Disney Animation Studios senaste filmer är musikalfilmer (fem av sju filmer i denna
analys kunde klassas som animerade musikaler), men det är intressant nog filmerna som
inte bygger på musikalformatet (Lilo & Stitch och Big Hiro 6) som här har klassats som
de progressivaste filmerna. Amerikanska musikaler har i allmänhet kritiserats för
rasistiskt innehåll, ofta i form av stereotyper som utnyttjas för att uppnå komik (Hoffman,
2014), och detta är tydligt vad som också ofta händer i Disneys musikalfilmer. Rankingen
av Lilo & Stitch och Big Hero 6 som de två progressivaste filmerna i denna analys, samt
deras avvikelse från den jämnt stigande progressiviteten bland Disneys övriga filmer,
kunde därför delvis bero på detta. Något man också kunde se som en orsak till dessa
avvikelser är det specifika materialet som dessa två filmer är baserade på. Till skillnad
från de övriga filmerna är Lilo & Stitch och Big Hero 6 inte baserade på folksagor eller
traditionella berättelser. Samtidigt har filmer som Aladdin och Mulan, vars källmaterial
tydligt kan kopplas ihop med en specifik kultur, kritiserats för disnifikation,
västernisation och orientalism, och därför också rankats som mer problematiska filmer i
denna analys.
Slutligen måste även Disneys försök till att skapa kulturellt medvetna och
progressiva filmer diskuteras. Utgående från intervjuer som inkluderats i bonusmaterialet
77

på de fysiska versionerna av filmerna verkar det som att Disneys filmskapare under den
senaste tiden åkt på forskningsresor till landet eller platsen där den framtida filmen
kommer att utspelas för att bekanta sig med kulturen och befolkningen. Ingen information
om att detta gjordes under produktionen av Aladdin och Lejonkungen hittades dock,
antagligen för att inga resor av denna typ genomfördes, vilket också kunde förklara de
mer problematiska framställningarna i dessa filmer. I samband med produktionen av
Prinsessan och grodan och Vaiana rådfrågade Disney även fokusgrupper som främst
bestod av personer som hörde till de befolkningsminoriteter som framställdes i filmerna.
Medan detta förarbete tydligt har haft en positiv effekt på Disneys
minoritetsframställningar, är det samtidigt svårt att hitta någon koppling mellan de
tidigare nämnda avvikande filmerna och mängden förarbete från Disneys sida. Något man
dock delvis kunde koppla ihop med Prinsessan och grodan samt Vaianas lägre status i
mån om progressivitet är filmernas regissörer. Bland filmerna inkluderade i denna studie
har John Musker och Ron Clements förutom dessa två filmer även regisserat Aladdin.
Dessa tre filmer kunde anses vara några av de mer problematiska filmerna inkluderade i
denna analys, speciellt med tanke på att de två modernare filmerna här anses vara mer
problematiska än deras företrädare. Trots detta är det problematiskt att påstå att dessa två
regissörer skulle vara mer rasistiska eller mindre kulturellt sensitiva än andra, eftersom
det är väldigt svårt att avgöra hos vem det kreativa ansvaret egentligen ligger i samband
med en Disneyfilm. Animerare, regissörer, producenter och företaget Disney ligger alla
bakom den slutliga filmen, och det är väldigt svårt att tydligt avgöra vem som ligger
bakom ett visst problematiskt beslut i filmen i fråga. Det är dock värt att poängtera att alla
regissörer för filmerna som inkluderades i denna studie är vita amerikanska män. Man
kan fråga sig själv om dessa Disneyfilmer skulle lyckas framställa ras, etnicitet och kultur
på ett positivare sätt om regissörerna för filmerna själva hörde till den ras, folkgrupp eller
kultur som filmen fokuserar på.

6.5 Sammanfattning

Framställningen av ras- och befolkningsminoriteter i Disneys animerade filmer verkar
sammanfattningsvis bli allmänt progressivare med tiden. I denna studie har det dock
framkommit att risken för feltolkning och kränkande material är större när det är frågan
om en musikal, eller när Disney baserar sin film på en redan existerande folksaga eller
78

annat material med kulturspecifikt värde. Också i Disneys filmer verkar vissa folkgrupper
vara mer utsatta för stereotyper än andra, och detta har med stor sannolikhet också
påverkat resultatet av denna analys. Dessa orsaker fungerar dock inte som
bortförklaringar från Disneys sida, och företaget kunde tydligt fortfarande göra mycket
för att förbättra sina minoritetsframställningar. Disneyförsvararen Douglas Brode
argumenterar i sitt tidigare nämnda verk att Disney varit bland de första i västvärlden som
producerat multikulturella filmer, och medan detta delvis kanske stämmer så räcker det
helt tydligt inte med att endast inkludera kulturella minoriteter om detta inte kan göras på
ett jämställt och rättvist sätt.
Många stereotypier och allmänt problematiska inslag finns fortfarande kvar i flera
av de modernare filmerna som Walt Disney Animation Studios har producerat, och
företaget Disney som vanligtvis associeras med sagor, magi, barndom, och oskyldighet
är sist och slutligen inte så oskyldigt.
