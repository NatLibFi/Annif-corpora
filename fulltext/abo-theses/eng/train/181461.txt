ABSTRACT
Detection of chemicals that induce damage to the DNA is an important aspect in drug
development. The recognition of these chemicals is based on in vitro studies followed by in
vivo studies, the latter being both expensive and ethically questionable. An early, accurate
prediction of the genotoxic properties of these chemicals is therefore highly desired.
The phosphorylated histones yH2AX and pH3 are well established genotoxicity markers,
yH2AX expressed upon double-stranded DNA damage caused by clastogens, and pH3
accumulating as a cause of aneuploidy in mitosis caused by aneugens. The detection of these,
in combination with a translocation of p53 to the nucleus in response to DNA damage, is one
example of markers used for high content genotoxicity analyses. In this study, these three
markers were used to evaluate the genotoxic predictivity of 16 reference compounds with
known properties in TK6 and HepG2 cells by two different high content methods for
genotoxicity screening. The cells were exposed to the compounds over a range of
concentrations for 4 and 24 hours. The first method used was a validated flow cytometry-based
DNA damage assay MultiFlow® which was used with both TK6 and HepG2 cells. The other
method was an imaging-based high content analysis method that was set up in this study and
tested on HepG2 cells only. The aim was to compare these two methods and see which method
could predict the genotoxic potential more accurately.
Using the MultiFlow® method with TK6 cells and previously determined cut-off values for
genotoxicity, 14 out of 16 compounds were predicted correctly. With the imaging-based
method with HepG2 cells the corresponding predictivity was 15 out of 16. By adapting the
imaging-based method to include a 48-hour incubation with the reference compounds all
compounds could be predicted correctly. This prediction did, however, not include p53 as a
criterion and it was therefore not considered as a significant marker in HepG2 cells in this study.
Based on these results the imaging-based genotoxicity assay with HepG2 cells was considered
a promising alternative for genotoxicity testing.

I INTRODUCTION
Toxicological analysis is an important aspect in safety for all chemical substances
(Corvi & Madia, 2017). In all industries, including the pharma, all chemicals intended
for animal or human use are required to be tested for their toxicological properties
(Custer & Sweder, 2008). The toxicological testing is regulated by the authorities and
all drugs under development are screened for a variety of toxicological properties
(Whitebread, Hamon, Bojanic, & Urban, 2005). A drug candidate that induces toxicity
in a cell or organism is highly undesirable and a common reason for rejection from the
drug development process (Whitebread et al., 2005). Therefore, it is desirable to be
able to detect the toxicological effects of the compounds as early as possible in the
development. To avoid extensive in vivo testing, which may lead to unnecessary costs
and animal suffering, improvement in precision and accuracy of in vitro tests is an
important aspect in drug development (Custer & Sweder, 2008).
The toxicological effects of chemicals can be classified into different categories. A
compound at a certain concentration is considered cytotoxic if it causes cell death
(Ramakrishna, Tian, Wang, Liao, & Teo, 2015). All chemicals are cytotoxic at a high
concentration and cytotoxicity can, in some cases, be observed as an outcome of other
types of toxicity. For example, mitochondrial toxins can cause depletion in the energy
of the cell which ultimately leads to apoptosis (Ramakrishna et al., 2015).
Genotoxicity, in contrast, is the mechanism where a compound induces damage to the
DNA (Custer & Sweder, 2008). Severe damage to the DNA may also lead to cell cycle
arrest and cause apoptosis (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006). As a consequence, the range of
concentrations in genotoxicity testing lies around and below the concentrations where
the compound shows cytotoxic properties.
Determination of genotoxic properties of chemicals is used to predict carcinogenic and
mutagenic effects in humans and animals. Damage to the DNA may lead to mutations
which give rise to cancer or otherwise damage the inheritance (Corvi & Madia, 2017).
Currently there are several approved in vitro methods for genotoxicity testing, but new
methods are of high interest for more accurate, efficient, cost effective and precise
determinations. Genotoxic testing is highly regulated to ensure the safety and
protection of human and animal health. Legislation covers several areas such as
pharmaceuticals, veterinary products, industrial chemistry, cosmetics, food additives,
pesticides and many more. (Corvi & Madia, 2017). Testing of compounds is primarily
8

Emmi Kuokkanen
based on in vitro testing, followed by in vivo testing. Guidelines for testing is both
dependant on the purpose of use of the product and the country where marketing
authorisations is sought. For pharmaceuticals the guidelines for genotoxicity testing
are regulated by the European community EEC in Europe, the Japanese ministry of
health and welfare in Japan and FDA in the USA (European Medicines Agency, 2012).
The guidelines for testing are based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) guidelines (OECD home.). One of the current challenges is to
develop methods that have a high sensitivity and specificity in vitro, which would
reduce the burden of expensive and ethically questionable in vivo testing. (Corvi &
Madia, 2017)

II LITERATURE REVIEW
1. DNA Damage
1.1 DNA damage pathway
The DNA is located in the nucleus of the cell and serves as the storage of genetic
information. It is continuously interacting with several different molecules and
substances, which are e.g., involved in transcription and replication. The DNA
molecule is highly dynamic and therefore also prone to errors and damages.
(Chatterjee & Walker, 2017) To be able to preserve and carry on the genetic
information the cell is continuously repairing damages that occur on the DNA. This
mechanism is collectively called the DNA damage response (DDR), which consists of
sensors that recognise the damage, and mediators and transducers which signal the
damage to effectors. There are several different types of DNA damage, commonly
classified as endogenous and exogenous damage (Chatterjee & Walker, 2017). The
endogenous damage is caused by biochemical reactions where the DNA molecule
reacts with factors naturally present in the cell, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)
or oxidative reactions with water (Chatterjee & Walker, 2017). The exogenous
damage is caused by external factors, such as radiation and chemical agents
(Chatterjee & Walker, 2017). The type of damage caused steers the DDR. Different
types of sensors recognise specific types of damage and mediate the signal through
various signalling cascades.
The DDR response reacts to the DNA damage and leads to a cascade of signalling
events that may cause cell cycle delay or arrest in an attempt to repair the damage to
the DNA. The final outcome is dependent on DNA damage checkpoint molecules that
consist of sensors, mediators, transducers and effectors, which will determine the
actions of the cell and guide it through cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis
(figure 1). (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006)
The DNA damage sensors consists of a group of proteins that are involved in
identifying different types of damage of DNA and mediate the signal of a damage via
transducer and mediator proteins. The sensor proteins accumulate at the sites of the
DNA damage, promoting the phosphorylation of the mediator proteins. The kinases
that mediate the phosphorylation of proteins in the DDR and cell cycle progression
10

Emmi Kuokkanen
are collectively called checkpoint kinases. (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006) The mediators
and transducers amplify the signal from the damage and mediate it to different types
of effector proteins, which regulate intracellular processes (Wan, Liu, Han, Zhang, &
Lu, 2014). The effectors are in many cases proteins that control the cell cycle which
allows the cells to repair the damage. Only when damage is repaired cell cycle
progression is continued. Otherwise, signals will mediate the cell to commit the
apoptotic pathway. (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006)

Figure 1, DNA damage response. Damage to the DNA or stalled replication leads to a
signalling cascade. The DNA damage sensors (green spheres on the DNA) identify the damage
and recruit mediator proteins (yellow and orange in close proximity to the DNA) to the site of
the damage. The mediators amplify the signal and mediate the signal to various transducer and
effector proteins. The effectors induce the cellular responses which may include changes in
transcription, RNA processing, chromatin remodelling and cell cycle arrest or progression.
These changes contribute to either DNA repair or apoptosis. (Jackson & Bartek, 2009)

1.2 Cell cycle progression and DNA damage
The most important function of the cell cycle is to replicate and to transfer the genetic
material of a cell intactly to both daughter cells. The cell cycle progress and DNA
damage response are, therefore, tightly coupled processes to avoid damages being
inherited to daughter cells. The cell cycle is divided into four stages: G1, S, G2 and M
phase (figure 2). The S phase stands for synthesis and represents the phase where the
DNA is replicated. The M phase stands for mitosis and is the stage where the
chromosomes condense and the cell divides. In between these phases the G1 and G2
“gap” phases take place, in which regulation of several cell cycle proteins and cell
cycle progression checkpoints is activated. One of the most important type of cell
cycle progression proteins are the cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinases (CDKs)
which interact with cyclins and control the cell cycle by periodic activation and
deactivation. In general, the activity of different CDKs vary from the G1 phase
throughout to the M phase, with different CDKs being active at different stages of the
cell cycle. In addition, for the cells to be able to progress from one phase to another,
certain checkpoint proteins need to be activated or deactivated. In the case of DNA
damage, the signalling molecules interact with these checkpoints and inhibit the cell
cycle progression until the damage has been corrected. The phase of the cell cycle can
also affect which type of result the DNA damage response has on the repair process.
(Hustedt & Durocher, 2016)

Figure 2, Cell cycle progression. In the G1 phase the cell prepares for division. At the
transition from the G1 to the S phase, certain regulatory CDKs need to become activated to
allow the cells to enter the S phase. In the S phase, the DNA is replicated to transition to the
G2 phase, where another set of checkpoint molecules are activated, which certify that the DNA
is fully replicated and the cell is ready to progress to the next phase. Likewise, at the G2 to M
transition checkpoint molecules allow transition when the cell is ready to divide. The M phase
when the cell divides is the shortest of the phases. As the division is successfully established,
the CDKs become inactivated resulting in that the daughter cells are shifted back to the G1
phase.

1.3 Histones in DNA damage
DNA architecture is highly dependent on all DNA-associated proteins. The histones
are one of these. The histone proteins form nucleosomes which have the DNA
wrapped around them. Nucleosomes are highly dynamic structures that, in addition to
chromosome condensation, allow the replication, transcription and repair of DNA.
(Bartova, Krejci, Harnicarova, Galiova, & Kozubek, 2008)

1.3.1 Structure of the nucleosomes
The nucleosomes consist of four main categories of histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.
The histones assemble as illustrated in figure 3. H2A and H2B form two dimers which
associate with a H3-H4 tetramer, consisting of two H3-H4 dimers. (Chen, Kang, Fan,
& Tang, 2014) The core histones share similar structures which consist of the core and
a tail-like structure that extends out of the nucleosome and is a site for several
posttranslational modifications (Chen et al., 2014). Histones can be modified by
acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and sumoylation, altering the structure and
activity of histones and the nucleosome formation. In addition, histones serve as
docking sites for other regulatory proteins (Chen et al., 2014).

Figure 3, Histone structure and histone assembly. The nucleosome consists of eight core
histones. The histones H3 and H4 form two dimers which form a tetramer. The H3-H4
tetramer then serves as a binding site for two H2A-H2B dimers.

1.3.2 H2AX in DNA damage response
The H2AX protein is one variant of the H2A family with an abundancy of about 10%
in human fibroblasts (Kopp, Khoury, & Audebert, 2019a). Since each nucleosome
consists of two H2A proteins, the H2AX is found approximately in every fifth
nucleosome. H2AX differs from other H2A subtypes with a unique C terminal tail
containing a highly conserved Serine139, located four residues from the end of the C
terminal tail (Dickey et al., 2009). This serine is rapidly phosphorylated in response to
DNA damage. The phosphorylated form of the histone is called γH2AX (Podhorecka,
Skladanowski, & Bozko, 2010).
The phosphorylation of H2AX is triggered at an early stage of DNA damage by
proteins of the PI3-kinase family which include ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM),
ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (figure
4) (Dickey et al., 2009). The type of DNA damage controls the expression and
phosphorylation of DNA damage response proteins. The signalling pathway that
follows is determined by the proteins that bind to the site of the break and which
molecules they interact with.
In case of a double-stranded break (DSB) ATM is autophosphorylated which is
followed by increased kinase activity and γH2AX phosphorylation. The
autophosphorylation of ATM is mediated by the DSB recognising MRE11-RAD50NBS1 (MRN)-complex which recruits both the kinase and its other targets to the site
of the damage. (Podhorecka et al., 2010) In addition, the γH2AX serves as a docking
site for several other proteins included in the DNA damage and signalling process.
Upon DSB, the complex mediates a positive feedback loop where the mediator of
DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) binds to γH2AX and interacts with parts
of the MDR complex. Since the complex promotes the ATM autophosphorylation, it
leads to the spreading of the H2AX phosphorylation on the length of the DNA.
(Podhorecka et al., 2010) The ATR and DNA-PK mediated responses are coupled to
other types of DNA damage and also lead to H2AX phosphorylation. ATR becomes
activated upon damage or failure of DNA replication, such as lagging replication forks
or single-stranded DNA breaks (Menolfi & Zha, 2020). Activation of DNA-PK is
mediated by the presence of double-stranded DNA ends (Menolfi & Zha, 2020). These
mechanisms result in H2AX phosphorylation upon DNA damage and the positive
feedback loop causes a significant expression of γH2AX in cells which have been
16

Emmi Kuokkanen
exposed to DNA damage. The dephosphorylation of γH2AX is also critical for DNA
damage response and cell cycle progression. One main protein involved in the
dephosphorylation of γH2AX is the Wip1 which is a chromatin-associated
phosphatase (Banerjee & Chakravarti, 2011). Several other phosphatases have been
identified to dephosphorylate γH2AX, some of them mediated by the same ATM
kinase involved in H2AX phosphorylation (Tu et al., 2013)

Figure 4, H2AX phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation of H2AX
is mediated by one or several of PI-3 family kinases. DNA-PK is activated upon recognition
of DS-DNA ends, ATR is activated upon replication stress and ATM as a consequence of
DSB. Upon DNA damage the MRN complex (see text for further details) is assembled on the
site of the break and recruits ATM to the site, promoting its autophosphorylation. ATM
phosphorylates H2AX on Ser139 and the phosphorylated γH2AX mediates the binding of
MDC1, which further interacts with the MRN complex. This interaction between the proteins
creates a feedback loop where γH2AX interacts with MDC1 which interacts with MRN
resulting in recruitment of ATM which spreads the phosphorylation of γH2AX.

1.3.3 Phosphorylation of H3 mediates chromosome condensation
Like the other histones, histone H3 has a tail that is highly prone to posttranslational
modifications. Upon progression through the cell cycle, the chromatin is remodelled
where one important aspect is the condensation and decondensation of the chromatin.
One well-established modification is the phosphorylation of H3 at Serine10, which is
mediated by the Aurora family of kinases, mainly Aurora B (Khoury, Zalko, &
Audebert, 2016a). The phosphorylated form of H3 is called pH3 which is present in
cells during metaphase when the chromatin is condensed (Hans & Dimitrov, 2001).
When the cell exits metaphase and the cell cycle progresses, the pH3 is
dephosphorylated and the chromatin returns to a less condensed form. The
phosphorylated form of H3 is, therefore, present only during mitosis. In a situation
where chromosome separation is damaged or interrupted the cell cycle arrests and pH3
stays in a phosphorylated state until the cell continues the cell division, or apoptosis is
mediated. (Kopp et al., 2019)

1.4 p53 in DNA damage
The tumor suppressor p53 is recognised as “the guardian of the genome”. It is present
in several processes concerning cell cycle progression and DNA damage (Williams &
Schumacher, 2016). p53 plays a central role in the signalling pathways of DNA
damage, controlling both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The concentration and
localisation of p53 in the cell is regulated by posttranslational modifications. In the
normal state ubiquitination leads to degradation of p53 but upon DNA damage p53
becomes phosphorylated by ATR and ATM kinases which are also involved in H2AX
phosphorylation (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006). The phosphorylation of p53 promotes its
nuclear localisation by inhibiting nuclear export, as well as by inhibiting ubiquitination
and degradation (Niida & Nakanishi, 2006). Therefore, upon DNA damage p53 may
localise and accumulate in the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for
proteins involved in the DDR (Reaves et al., 2000).

1.5 Chemicals induce genotoxicity by several mechanisms
1.5.1 The mechanism of action classifies the type of damage
Different chemicals can cause genotoxic effects in several ways. A straightforward
DNA damage is when the compound itself interacts with the DNA causing DNA
damage or cell division errors. In other cases, the compound is metabolised by the cell
and the metabolites of the compound cause the damage. A chemical can also disturb
other processes within the cell which ultimately leads to a toxic effect. In addition, the
chemical or its metabolites can interact with other chemicals and in a combination
become toxic. The mechanism of action (MoA) of a chemical is used to classify
chemicals into different toxicological groups to understand the mechanism behind
their toxicity. The genotoxic effects are commonly classified into two groups,
aneugenic and clastogenic compounds.

1.5.2 Aneugens
Compounds that are classified as aneugens are chemicals that do not interact with the
DNA itself but rather cause defects in the mechanisms related to cell division and
chromosome separation (Khoury et al., 2016). The separation of chromosomes in
mitosis is a complex process involving several proteins. Inhibition or damage to any
of these compounds might cause defects in segregation. Aneugenic compounds
interact with processes such as mitotic spindle formation or degradation or inhibit
mitotic kinases, resulting in improper chromosome segregation or cell cycle arrest.
Vinblastine is one well-recognised aneugen, which specifically binds to microtubules
in the mitotic spindle and interferes with their function (Chun, Garrett, & Vail, 2007).
Likewise, colchicine and paclitaxel are chemicals that interfere with microtubules,
colchicine inhibiting their assembly and paclitaxel inhibiting the disassembly
(Ganguly, Yang, & Cabral, 2010) (Bharadwaj & Yu, 2004). Both mechanisms inhibit
the cells from proceeding with the cell cycle. These compounds, therefore, cause the
cells to pause in the M phase, which can be seen by expression of phosphorylated pH3
in the cells (Khoury et al., 2016). In a population, an increase in number of pH3
positive cells, therefore, indicate a mechanism that cause the cells to remain prolonged
in the M phase. The improper segregation of chromosomes and errors in division can
lead to both chromosome breakage, whole chromosomes being left behind or
19

Emmi Kuokkanen
transferred to the wrong daughter cell. Aneugenic compounds can also lead to
formation of micronuclei, which are fragments of DNA that fail to end up in the main
nucleus of the daughter cells. These pieces of DNA form tiny extranuclear bodies
which are up to 10-100 times smaller than the main nuclei. (Westerink, Schirris,
Horbach, & Schoonen, 2011)

1.5.3 Clastogens
Clastogenic compounds are agents that interact directly with the DNA, thus inducing
damage to it (Khoury et al., 2016). There are several ways that a chemical can cause
DNA damage and the type of damage caused usually determines the path of DDR.
One type of damage is damage to only one strand of the DNA, i.e., modifications to
the bases or sugars of the DNA backbone. A more severe type of damage is the DSB
which lead to the breakage of both DNA strands. The repair of DSB is usually either
via non homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-based repair (HRR). As
discussed previously, the DSB trigger a pathway that leads to H2AX phosphorylation
and is therefore a well-established validated marker for genotoxicity caused by
clastogenic compounds. Upon the DDR p53 is in many cases upregulated as a response
to the damage (Williams & Schumacher, 2016). Clastogenic damage can arise via
several mechanisms. One well-established clastogen is Methyl methanesulfonate
(MMS), which is a DNA methylating agent which forms DNA adducts (Takeiri et al.,
2019). Other types of clastogens are for example cross-linkers, topoisomerase
inhibitors and compounds that form reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Takeiri et al.,
2019). Damage caused by clastogens can lead to the formation of micronuclei as
unrepaired or incorrectly repaired DSB can cause fragments of DNA to be left behind
during mitosis (Westerink et al., 2011).

1.6 Mechanisms for detecting DNA damage
As several mechanisms of DNA damage exist, different methods for genotoxicity
testing are required for prediction of these properties. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organisation that provides
guidelines for identification and characterisation of potentially hazardous chemicals
(OECD home.). There are several well-established tests for DNA damage, including
the bacterial mutagenesis test, the micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration test
and the comet assay test.
The bacterial mutation test, also known as the Ames test, is a method used to detect
point mutations in the genome. It is based on a method using a large number of mutated
bacteria from different strains, which are exposed to the test chemical. The bacteria
are unable to synthesise an essential amino acid as a cause of the mutation, unless the
chemical is causing mutations which are able to revert the original mutation. (OECD,
2020)
Whereas the Ames test is only able to detect point mutations, the micronucleus test,
the chromosome aberration test and the comet assay test can detect larger damages on
the DNA. These are all based on detection of larger DNA fragments that are produced
upon DNA damage. The comet assay test is based on detection of DNA fragments on
an agarose gel. Cells exposed to test chemicals are lysed and exposed to
electrophoresis at a high pH. The stained DNA can then be visualised on the gel as a
comet-like structure, where the different-sized DNA fragments have migrated
different distances. The intensity and size of the tail represent the amount of DNA
damage. (OECD, 2016c) The chromosome aberration test is based on microscopy of
cells in metaphase and analyses the structure of the chromatin. The cells are treated
with a metaphase arresting substance and stained, after which the chromatin from cells
in metaphase are analysed microscopically. (OECD, 2016a) The micronucleus test is
similar to the comet assay by means of detecting DNA fragments from the cells. In
contrast to the comet assay, the micronucleus test can be performed in several ways
where the fragments of nuclei can be visualised by different methods. One approach
is to use flow cytometry which involves two-step staining for detection of micronuclei.
Cells are stained with one dye prior to lysis, followed by another dye after lysis. This
allows for elimination of dying cells which have an exposed plasma membrane, as the
first dye penetrates only into dying cells. Upon analysis, when cells are lysed and
21

Emmi Kuokkanen
stained, only cells that have an intact membrane are stained only with the second dye.
The micronucleus test can, therefore, more accurately detect damage which is not a
cause of cytotoxicity. (OECD, 2016b) (Westerink et al., 2011) Even though these tests
are able to predict potential genotoxic properties of compounds, one drawback is their
inability to determine the mechanism of action the genotoxicity. To be able to
characterise and assess the true risk of the compound the understanding of its
mechanism of action is an important aspect. (Smart, Daniel J. et al., 2020)
In addition to the novel genotoxicity analyses, new methods using different types of
biomarkers involved in DNA damage are rapidly evolving. As discussed previously,
the DDR involves many types of molecules which become activated upon different
types of damage. The Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein family is
involved in the recognition and repair of single-stranded DNA breaks. Upon a break,
PARP binds to the DNA and generates a Poly ADP-ribose chain which serves as a
docking site for DNA repair proteins. (Luo & Kraus, 2012) This accumulation of
proteins on damaged DNA is used as a source to determine DNA damage. Another
biomarker for other types of stress is, for example, the 8-hydroxu-2’-deoxyguanosine
which is a major product of DNA oxidation. The presence of this marker, thus,
indicates damage through oxidation. (Valavanidis, Vlachogianni, & Fiotakis, 2009)
The use of different biomarkers for the determination of the mechanism of action has
been of growing interest in the past few years (Corvi & Madia, 2017). This has resulted
in commercial availability of a growing number of antibodies and small molecules for
detection of several different pathway proteins. Therefore, a combination of novel
genotoxicity tests with different biomarkers could provide insight into not only the
genotoxicity but, in addition, to the biological mechanisms behind the damage.

1.7 Technologies for genotoxicity screening
For detection of markers indicating genotoxicity several methods have been implied.
One of the most used methods in high throughput screening is based on labelling of
markers of interest with fluorescent dyes and measurement with flow cytometry.
Another method is based on high content imaging where cells are labelled with
antibodies or probes and imaged by automated imaging.

22

Emmi Kuokkanen

1.7.1 Fluorescent labelling allows for detection of several markers
Fluorescent labelling is a method that uses different types of fluorescent dyes,
molecules, proteins, or antibodies to detect a specific marker. Several different types
of fluorophores that are able to be excited and emit light at known wavelengths are
commercially available. These fluorophores can be attached to a variety of motifs that
can bind to a specific part of the marker of interest. Immunofluorescence is a technique
which allows for detection of a target of interest by the use of fluorescently labelled
antibodies. The method can be used either by direct or indirect labelling (figure 5). In
the direct labelling the detectable fluorophore is attached directly to the primary
antibody. In indirect labelling the primary antibody binds to its target and a secondary
antibody carrying the fluorophore is used to detect the primary antibody. The heavy
chains of the antibodies are species-specific which allows for secondary antibodies to
be targeted against the species of animal where the primary antibody was produced. A
wide range of antibodies are commercially available. The combination of primary
antibodies from several species allows for the use of several secondary antibodies with
different fluorophores at the same time and detecting these by flow cytometry or
microscopy.

Figure 5, Direct and indirect immunolabelling. Direct labelling uses fluorescent primary
antibodies which bind to their target. Indirect labelling uses a primary antibody from a host
animal which binds to its target followed by staining with a fluorescent secondary antibody
that targets the primary antibody. The indirect labelling allows for amplification of the signal
since several secondary fluorescent antibodies can bind to the same primary antibody (Odell

& Cook, 2013).

1.7.2 Flow cytometry can be used for detection of fluorophores
To be able to identify the fluorescently labelled markers of interest a machine capable
of exciting and detecting the fluorophore is required. To understand how these markers
are identified and how data is acquired a short introduction to the basics of flow
cytometry is described in this section.

1.7.2.1 Basics of flow cytometry
Flow cytometry is a technology that allows for analysis of single particles using light. The
method is dependent on a flow cytometer. The principle of the technology is based on a system
that acquires a liquid sample through a thin needle and allows particles, commonly the size of
a cell, to pass one by one through a laser beam in the flow cytometer. The light that hits the
particle is scattered and detected by different detectors of the flow cytometer. Some detect the
scatter of the light which hits the particles while others detect fluorescence from dyes that are
used to stain the samples. The signals that the instrument captures are transferred to a computer
which interprets them to visible data (figure 6). (Wiederschain, 2011)

Figure 6, The principles of flow cytometry. Simplified view of flow cytometry. The sample
is pumped through the fluidics system of the flow cytometer and passes through a laser beam.
The light scatters from the particle and is detected by detectors located in different angles of
the light source. The optics of the machine consists of filters that allow different wavelengths
of light to pass while reflecting others. The data collected by the detectors is transferred to a
computer for further analysis. (Wiederschain, 2011) Image from Molecular Probes (Thermo
Fisher Scientific)

1.7.2.2 Detection of light
When a particle passes through the laser beam of the flow cytometer it refracts and
scatters light in many directions. The light that hits the particle is detected in form of
voltage pulses by the detectors. This scatter can be measured by forward scatter (FSC)
and side scatter (SSC). The FSC is detected in front of the laser and consists of light
that is scattered in the forward direction which is proportional to the size of the
particle. The SSC is detected usually 90° from the particle and indicates the light that
is reflected in larger angles from the particle. This light is proportional to the
complexity of the particle.
The emitted light of excited fluorescent probes is captured by other detectors in the
instrument. Different commercially available probes have a wide range of excitation
and emission spectra which allows for simultaneous detection of probes with different
emission spectra using specific filters. The filters either reflect or bypass the light of a
specific wavelength allowing for the wavelengths emitted by a single particle to be
detected.
The signals that arise from the scattered light are detected in forms of voltage pulses,
which can be defined by height (H), width (W) and area (A). The width of the pulse is
the time that it takes for the particle to pass through the laser beam and is, thus,
proportional to the particle size. The height of the pulse is defined as the intensity of
the signal and is proportional to the amount of light scattered. The height of the signal
can be variable depending on the voltage properties of the instrument. The area is
defined as height*width and is, thus, less impacted by the voltage settings than height
alone.

1.7.2.3 Data from flow cytometric analyses need to be processed
The data gathered from the flow cytometer is analysed using software suitable for flow
cytometry data, generally provided together with the hardware. The software
commonly allows for analysis of the gathered data in forms of visual plots and
histograms, gates and logical analyses. The amount of data produced by flow
cytometry can be extensive, and therefore these types of methods are also known as
high content screening (HCS).

25

Emmi Kuokkanen
The plots allow for visualisation of data using different parameters, including FSC,
SSC and channels with different emission filters. For example, in figure 7 a, a gate is
created around the population that represents the cells. The plot itself is derived from
a logical population of all events excluding counting beads (gated in another plot). The
parameters used are the intensity of Propidium Iodide (PI) a fluorescent agent used to
stain the DNA, versus FSC which detects particle size. From the population of cells,
a histogram can be created (figure 7 b) using the intensity of PI versus number of
events. Gates can be created from the histogram which represent the normal nuclei,
polyploidy, and 2n-polyploidy.

Figure 7, Gating strategies for Flow cytometry data. a) In this dot plot, the parameters
fluorescent channel 3 (FL3-H), which represents the intensity of Propidium Iodide (PI), versus
forward scatter (FSC-H), which represents the particle size, are used to visualise the cell
population in a sample. Each dot in the plot represents one particle. A gate can be created
around the population of interest. b) A histogram of the data from the “Cells” gate. The
parameters used are FL3-A, representing the intensity of PI, versus number of events to
visualise the nuclei. Gates representing the normal nuclei, polyploidy and 2n-polyploidy are
created.

1.7.2.4 Commercially available DNA damage screening method - MultiFlow®
The MultiFlow® kit is developed by Litron Laboratories and is validated for the
purpose of genotoxic screenings (Kopp, Khoury, & Audebert, 2019b). The kit
combines markers for well-established genotoxicity markers. One of the kits uses the
markers for γH2AX, pH3 and p53 with a DNA stain and counting beads which allows
for an efficient identification of DNA damage in one-step. For the use of MultiFlow®
the cell line used needs to have a functional p53 expression to allow for correct
26

Emmi Kuokkanen
identification of p53. The validation of this MultiFlow®-kit using TK6 cells has been
done as an interlaboratory study. The study tested 84 reference compounds with
known genotoxic potential. Based on the data from all seven laboratories, cut-off
values were used to determine the thresholds for genotoxicity, known as the global
evaluation factors (GEFs) for aneugenicity and clastogenicity for TK6 cells. (Bryce et
al., 2017) The values are presented as percentage fold increases compared with
negative controls on the same plates. The compounds are considered genotoxic if two
continuous concentrations exceed two of the GEF criteria. The GEFs for aneugens are,
1.71-fold pH3 at 4h, 1.52-fold 24h pH3, 1.45-fold nuclear p53 at 24h and 5.86-fold
24h polyploidy. The GEFs for clastogens are, 1.51-fold 4h ɣH2AX, 1.40-fold 4h
nuclear p53, 2.11-fold 24h ɣH2AX and 1.45-fold 24h nuclear p53. (Bryce et al., 2017)
These criteria can be used as a guideline for further genotoxic analysis.

1.7.3 High content analysis provides an imaging-based method for
detection of fluorophores
High content imaging (HCI) is a microscopy-based imaging system, based on high
throughput automated cellular image acquisition. The method is based on the principle
of immunofluorescence and detection of fluorescent probes by different types of light
sources in the microscope. The light sources are used to excite the fluorophores and
the emitted light is detected by the microscope. In combination with image analysis
software, the HCI can produce sensitive, high resolution images on a large scale. The
combination of these features enables a High Content Analysis (HCA) (sometimes
also known as HCS). (Li & Xia, 2019) Recent studies have suggested that HCA could
be preferred over flow cytometry in genotoxic analysis since HCA is considered more
sensitive and for instance allows identification of spots within single nuclei or cells
and intercellular events (Garcia-Canton, Anadon, & Meredith, 2013). In addition, it
does not require cells to be in suspension which allows for samples to be re-analysed
if necessary (Garcia-Canton et al., 2013).

III AIMS OF THE STUDY
The aim of this study is to compare in vitro genotoxicity screening methods and their
predictivity. The comparison is mainly focused on screening by flow cytometry, a
method that is validated and currently in use at Orion Pharma, and high content
imaging, a method that is set up in this study. To achieve this, 16 reference compounds
with known genotoxic properties are screened. First comparison is performed with
MultiFlow® method by flow cytometry using two different cell lines, TK6 cells that
are validated for this method, and HepG2 cells which are to be used in imaging, to
ensure that the same markers can be used in both cell lines. Next, the imaging-based
method is set up and tested. For this purpose, suitable antibodies for screening are
chosen and tested for concentration and functionality together. The same reference
compounds are then screened with the imaging-based method. The results between the
methods and cell lines are analysed and improvements to the imaging platform are
made if necessary. The goal is to set up an imaging assay that would be able to predict
genotoxicity in terms of specificity and sensitivity, more accurately or as accurately
as in the flow cytometry-based method currently in use. If a successful imaging system
is established, additional compounds and additional markers can be tested to test if
false positive results can be reduced with the imaging platform, with the use of for
example cytotoxicity markers.

An overview of the workflow of this project is shown in figure 8. First two cell lines,
TK6 and HepG2, are exposed to 16 reference compounds and analysed for DNA
damage by MultiFlow®-DNA damage kit in flow cytometry (figure 8 a). Following,

2.1 Cell lines
One of the two cell lines used in this study was adherent HepG2 cells (C3A
[HepG2/C3A, derivate of Hep G2 (ATCC HB-8065)] (ATCC® CRL-10741™) lot
60208249), derived from human liver hepatocellular carcinoma. The other cell line
used was the suspension cell line TK6 (ATCC® CRL-8015), human lymphoblasts
derived from hereditary spherocytosis from the spleen. TK6 cells were acquired from
Gentronix laboratory and HepG2 cells from Lundbeck, Denmark.

2.1.1 Subculturing
Adherent HepG2 cells were grown in TC-Treated 75cm² flasks (Corning®, 430641U)
in a growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), high
Glucose (1x) (41965, Gibco Life Technologies) with 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (11360039, Gibco Life Technologies), 1x Minimum Essential Medium Non-essential Amino
Acids Solution (MEM NEAA) (11140-035, Gibco Life Technologies), 5 mM Hepes
(H0887, Sigma), 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Heat Inactivated) (10500-064,
Gibco Life Technologies) and 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin (P0781, Sigma). The cells
were grown in humified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were grown to a
60% confluency and subcultured twice a week. For subculturing, the old medium was
aspirated from the cells and the cells were washed twice with 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate
buffered saline (DPBS/PBS) (Gibco™, 14190144). Cells were detached with 0.05%
Trypsin-EDTA (25300-062, Gibco Life Technologies) for 5 minutes and resuspended
in 5 ml growth medium. To minimise the number of aggregated cells the cellsuspension was resuspended five times with a 5 ml pipette tip with a 300 µl tip on its
tip. The cells were transferred to 15 ml fresh medium at a concentration of 0.1x106
cells/ml (4-day interval) or 0.2x106 cells/ml (3-day interval).
TK6 cells were grown in uncoated T75-flasks (NUNC™ 156800) in RPMI 1640
Medium (Gibco™ A1049101) with 10% inactivated HI Horse Serum (Gibco™
26050-088), 97 µg/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco™ 15140-122) and 2 mM
GlutaMAX™-I Supplement (Gibco™ 35050-061). The cells were grown in a
humified incubator at 37 ºC and 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured twice weekly, by
transferring cell suspension from the culture to 50 ml fresh medium at a concentration
of 0.004/0.005x106 cells/ml (subculture interval of four days) or 0.015/0.010x106
cells/ml (subculture interval of three days). In order to maintain exponential growth,
cells were maintained at a density lower than 1 million cells/ml.

2.1.2 Plating of cells
HepG2 cells were prepared for assay by trypsinization, as described previously,
followed by mixing of the cell suspension with a 21g needle and a 5 ml syringe three
times. Plating of HepG2 cells was done on Poly-D-lysine coated 96- or 384-well
plates. For HCA, Cell Carrier Ultra 384- and 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer) were used
and for flow cytometry BioCoat™ 96-well plates (Corning®). On the 96-well plates
cells will be plated with the density of 8000 cells/well in 100 µl (0.08x106 cells/ml)
and on the 384-well plates 2800 cells/well in 25 µl (0.056x106 cells/ml). Cells were
counted using a Mammalian Cell Counter (NucleoCounter® NC-100™ from
Chemometec) and diluted in growth medium in a concentration depending on the plate
type. The cells were plated using a stepper. In HCA, the plates were allowed to warm
to room temperature for 1 hour prior to plating and following plating the plates were
left for 1 hour in the laminar flow hood before transferring them to the incubator.
Plating was performed approximately 24 hours prior to compound administration.
For TK6 cells, the cells were plated on 96-well U-Bottom non-treated microplates
(Falcon®) at a concentration of 0.3x106 cells/ml, with 100 µl/well. The culture flask
was mixed, and the cells were counted using the NucleoCounter®. The right amount
of cell suspension was transferred and diluted to obtain the concentration of 0.3x106
cells/ml. The suspension was plated using a stepper.

2.2 Chemicals
The reference compounds, solvents and their mode of action are listed in Table 1. All
chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The concentration indicated in the
table was the highest concentration studied. All chemicals were diluted to a 100-fold
stock solution to obtain a 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration on the cells,
except for those compounds which were diluted in other solvents. The inconsistency
for these compounds was acknowledged but due to the automation of the method could
not be adapted. All compounds were tested to a prior known toxic concentration or
1000 µM unless the compounds were insoluble to that extent. In that case, the highest
concentration was a 1:100 dilution from the highest soluble concentration. Due to
differences in the two cell lines used, the concentrations of some of the compounds
were adjusted during the experiment.

2.3 Compounds to cells
The reference compounds were diluted in DMSO by automated liquid handling
equipment (Hamilton Microlab STAR) to obtain a concentration series of the
compounds. The compounds were first diluted on a separate dilution plate prior to
pipetting on the cells. Addition of compounds to cells was done by the same liquid
handling equipment. For flow cytometry a 20-point concentration series was used,
starting from the top concentration (TC) and TC*0.75 indicated in table 1. These two
concentrations were diluted 1:2 in parallel in 10 steps to obtain the 20-point
concentration series. An example using the top concentration 1000 µM is provided in
table 2. For HCA the concentration series used was a 10-step dilution with 2
replicates. The compounds were diluted from the same top concentrations in 1:2 for 8
steps and the final 2 steps 1:10. An example using the top concentration 1000 µM is
provided in table 3.

In addition, 3 controls were used on each plate, CCCP (non genotoxicant), vinblastine
(aneugen) and MMS (clastogen) to ensure each experiment was reliable. For flow
cytometry the concentrations for the controls (in µM) were as follows: CCCP; 12.5,
6.25, 3.125 and 1,562, vinblastine; 0.012, 0.006, 0.003 and 0.0015 and for MMS; 100,
50, 25 and 12.5. For every 96-well plate there was one series of controls. Due to
differences in automation for the different protocols, for HCA no dilution of controls
was made, the highest concentration of the compounds mentioned above were used in
10 replicates for every 384-well plate. In addition, for every 96-well plate there were
4 DMSO controls with only 1% DMSO. After compound administration cell plates
were transferred to a humified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until staining or
fixation.

2.4 Measurement of precipitation
From the compound dilution of the reference compounds a separate precipitation plate
was made containing only the growth media of the cells and the same concentrations
of compounds as on the incubation plates. These plates were measured for
precipitation using a Nephelometer (NEPHELOstar® BMG Labtech) which detects
insoluble particles in the medium. In addition, the plates were inspected using a light
microscope for visible precipitation. The plates were measured at timepoint 0 hours
and 24 hours, as well as 4 hours in the flow cytometry assay. The precipitation values
acquired by the nephelometer were analysed as fold changes compared to all negative
controls for each plate separately. For the compounds where a precipitation fold over

10 was calculated, or visible precipitation was observed, the values above the lowest
precipitating concentration were excluded.

2.5 Measurement by flow cytometry
For both cell lines genotoxicity was analysed by the MultiFlow method with the
detection of markers for γH2AX, pH3 and p53. These were measured by Flow
cytometry using the MultiFlow®-kit developed by Litron laboratories and the protocol
used was based on instructions of the manufacturer. The assay was performed
similarly on TK6 cells and HepG2 cells with the expectation of detachment of HepG2
cells prior to analysis. The samples were measured with flow cytometer iQue screener
(IntelliCyt®). Both cell lines were stained at 4 hours and 24 hours with MultiFlow®
complete labelling solution.

2.5.1 Staining of cells
Staining of cells was done using MultiFlow® complete labelling solution, containing
Nuclei Release solution with counting beads, DNA stain (Propidium Iodide), RNAse
solution, γH2AX-, pH3- and p53 markers. The staining solution was prepared
according to table 4. With HepG2 cells FBS was also added to the solution.
Table 4, MultiFlow® kit compounds and volumes. (MultiFlow(R).)

With TK6 cells 15 µl of labelling solution was transferred to a 384-well PerkinElmer
ProxiPlate and 5 µl cell suspension was added. The solution was thoroughly mixed by
resuspension. The ProxiPlate was then transferred onto a shaker for 15 minutes before
proceeding with analysis.
With HepG2 cells the medium from the plate was aspirated away and the plate was
washed one time with 100 µl PBS. Following, 25 µl cold Accutase® was added to the
plate and the plate was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature prior to adding
50 µl of complete labelling solution on the cells. The suspension was mixed
thoroughly by resuspension 15 times and then transferred to Falcon® 96-well UBottom non-treated microplates. The plates were then transferred onto a shaker for 15
minutes before proceeding with analysis.

2.5.2 Plate analysis
Intellicyt iQue Screener from IntelliCyt® Corporation was used as hardware for flow
cytometry analysis. The software used, Forecyt® was provided by the same company.
GLP was followed with the instrument and washes and QC were performed as
suggested by the manufacturer. The emission filters of iQue hardware are listed in
table 5. For TK6 cells a 6 second sip time/well was used and for HepG2 cells 10
seconds. All plates were shaken 1800 RPM every 6th well.

2.6 Measurement by high content analysis
For the imaging analysis the same principals as in flow cytometry was adapted. The
markers detected were γH2AX, pH3 and p53 at 4-, 24- and 48-hour timepoints. The
plates were fixed at these timepoints, stained by fluorescent labelled antibodies and
analysed with Operetta High-Content Imaging System from PerkinElmer. Prior to this,
the antibodies for the markers were tested with the method. Concentrations for the
antibodies and their functionality together were tested with reference compounds and
negative controls.

2.6.1 Setting up the HCA assay
For the HCA assay the HepG2 cells were plated as previously described in the first
stage on 96-well and later on 384-well plates. In the first stage the staining protocol
was set up and the primary and secondary antibodies were tested, both to determine
optimal concentrations and functionality in co-incubations. The 96-well plates were
divided into sections, one section treated with the aneugen vinblastine, 12 nM with
1% DMSO, one with the clastogen MMS 20 mM, one with Nutlin-3 10 µM with 1%
DMSO and the last serving as the control with only 1% DMSO. Plates were fixed at
36

Emmi Kuokkanen
24-hour timepoint. The antibodies used were selected based on previous in house-tests
and literature reviews. The highest concentration of the primary antibodies tested was
the concentration recommended by the manufacturer. The primary antibodies used
were Phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) Rabbit mAb (#9718 from Cell Signalling
technology), Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) Mouse mAb (#9706 from Cell Signalling
technology), which had both been tested in-house previously. For p53 two alternatives
were used, one from Biorbyt (orb153342) and one from Novus (AF 1355), both Goat
polyclonal antibodies. The secondary antibodies used were Goat anti-Mouse IgG
(H+L) Alexa Fluor® 488, Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) DyLight 550 and Rabbit antiGoat IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor® 647.

2.6.1.1 Staining protocol for HCA
After incubation with compounds the medium was aspirated away, and the plates were
washed once with 37ºC PBS. For 96-well plates a 100 µl/well volume was used and
for 384-well plates a 50 µl/well volume, unless otherwise stated. The cells were fixed
with a 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for 15 minutes. The fixation was
aspirated away and 37ºC PBS was added for 5 minutes. Washing procedures were
repeated three times with PBS left on the plate. The plates were either stained
immediately or stored at +4ºC.
Prior to staining the plates were washed with a permeabilization buffer, containing
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 5 minutes. The permeabilization buffer was
aspirated away and cells were blocked with a 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in
PBS (BSA-PBST) solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. BSA-PBST was
aspirated away and the primary antibodies in 5% BSA-PBST solution were added.
The plates were then incubated either for 2 hours in RT or overnight at +4ºC at a mild
shake. The primary antibodies were washed away with 3x PBS for 5 minutes as
described previously and the secondary antibody in 5% BSA-PBS was added to the
plates. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed 3x
with PBS for 5 minutes with the last wash containing 0.001 mg/ml Hoechst and
incubated for 10 minutes. The plates were washed one last time for 5 minutes with
PBS and finally PBS was left on the plates prior to imaging.

2.6.1.2 Antibody concentration determination for HCA
Appropriate antibody concentration determination was performed on 96-well plates
with three reference compounds: Vinblastine, MMS, nutlin-3 and a DMSO control.
Each concentration was tested as duplicates for all four well types in order to ensure
correct binding to target. The concentration ranges tested are stated in table 6. The
values provided are stated as dilutions, 1:100 means 1 µl antibody to 99 µl solvent.
All the secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500. Following the same protocol, the
antibodies were multiplexed to ensure that they were able to both bind to their correct
targets and not interfere with each other. For this purpose, a scheme combining all
possible combinations with both primary and secondary antibodies were created and
tested.

tested was the concentration provided by the manufacturer. B = Biorbyt, N=Novus.

2.6.1.3 Plate imaging
The software used in combination with Operetta was Harmony High-Content Imaging
and Analysis Software from PerkinElmer. The plates were imaged using a 20x water
immersion objective. The channels used were determined by the secondary antibodies
and Hoechst. The channels used were configured from a database provided with the
software. The channels were Hoechst33342 (excitation 355-385, emission 430-500),
Alexa Fluor® 488 (excitation 460-490, emission 500-550), DyLight 550 (excitation
530-560, emission 570-650) and Alexa Fluor 647 (excitation 615-645, emission 655760).

by Intellicyt. Data processing was done based on MultiFlow® instruction manual with
some adaptions dependent on the flow cytometer in use. The fluorescent channels and
their corresponding fluorophore are listed in table 7.

For each concentration of each compound the median from the replicated experiments
was used for analysis. In addition to this, the median absolute deviation (MAD) was
counted. It is defined as the median of the median of all data points minus each data
value. The MAD was counted using the formula:
𝑀𝐴𝐷 = 𝑀((𝑀(𝑣1 … 𝑛) − 𝑣1), 𝑀((𝑀(𝑣1 … 𝑛) − 𝑣2) … (𝑀((𝑣1 … 𝑛) − 𝑣𝑛)
Where M = Median, v= value of each data point, n = number of values (Leys, Ley,
Klein, Bernard, & Licata, 2013)
For simplicity, for 6 values the MAD is counted as follows:
MEDIAN (ABS(value1-(MEDIAN(all values))), ABS(value3-(MEDIAN(all values))),
ABS(value5-(MEDIAN(all values))), ABS(value2-(MEDIAN(all values))),
ABS(value4-(MEDIAN(all values))), ABS(value6-(MEDIAN(all values))))

3. Results
3.1. Results from measurements by flow cytometry
The evaluation of genotoxicity of the 16 reference compounds with TK6 cells and
HepG2 cells were measured by the MultiFlow® DNA damage kit by flow cytometry.
The results for the two cell lines with this method is presented in this section.

3.1.1 Handling of raw data from flow cytometric analyses
All data from the flow cytometric analyses with both TK6 and HepG2 were handled
separately for each plate. Each plate corresponded to one experiment with all
concentrations for all 16 references, 16 negative controls and 3 x 16 positive controls.
From all data gathered the counting beads were gated in a dot plot using the intensity
of FITC versus size of the particles (figure 9 a). The beads were used as quality control
to ensure even sample uptake from each well (figure 9 b). A logical population
consisting of all events excluding beads was created, and from this population the cells
were gated using intensity of DNA stain PI versus particle size (figure 9 c). From the
population of cells, a histogram was created with number of events versus PI intensity.
In this histogram three populations were gated, one representing normal nuclei (or
cycling nuclei as stated in figure 10, the other polyploidy, and the third a gate
representing both, 2n-polyploidy (figure 9 d). From the 2n-polyploidy population a
new dot plot was created with the intensity of PE on the y-axis and PI on the x- axis.
From this plot the pH3-positive mitotic cells were visualised and gated (figure 9 e).
Due to some spectral overlap between the DNA-associated fluorescence and PE
fluorescence, compensation between the channels were adjusted if necessary, in a way
that the pH3-positive cells were distinguished from the main population, as indicated
by the MultiFlow® instructions. For the two final populations, γH2AX and nuclear
p53, the logical population used was normal nuclei (from figure 9 d) excluding pH3positive events (from figure 9 e). From this population, the intensity of
AlexaFluor®647 and PI was used for visualisation and gating of γH2AX (figure 9 f).
Likewise, for p53 the intensities of FITC and PI were used for gating nuclear p53
(figure 9 g). The summarised gating logic is presented in figure 10. The data inside
the gates represent the data that was exported in each specific category.
The data collected was exported to Excel, with each well represented as one sample in
one row. The data exported for each well was Count of Beads, Count of Cells, Count
41

Emmi Kuokkanen
of 2n-polyploidy, Count of Normal Nuclei, Count of pH3-positive, Median FL1-A of
Nuclear p53 and Median FL4-A of γH2AX. The “Count” represents all particles that
localise inside the gated area of the specific parameter. The “Median” was the median
intensity of the signal from the area of the specified channel from all particles that
were localised inside the gate of the specific parameter.
From the exported data, the metrics for the parameters Count of Cells, Count of pH3positive, Median FL1-A of Nuclear p53 and Median FL4-A of γH2AX were presented
as folds over negative controls for each plate. The formulas used are presented in
section 2.7.3. To ensure that the experiments were successful the positive controls
were checked to meet the GEFs for aneugen (vinblastine) and clastogen (MMS), as
well as that the negative controls did not show any marked increases in genotoxicity
markers.

gated in a dot plot representing all captured events with FL1-H on the y-axis and FSC-A on
the x-axis. The size and fluorescence of the beads are provided by the manufacturer which
allows for identification based on these parameters. This population was named “Beads” b) A
heat map was created based on the “Beads” gate, which represents the number of beads for
each well. This ensured even uptake of samples from each well in the experiment. c) A logical
population with all events excluding the beads from a) was created, and with FL3-H on the yaxis and FSC-H on the x-axis the cells were identified. A gate was created around this
population and named “Cells”. d) Based on the “Cells”-gate a histogram with the number of
events on the y-axis and FL3 on the x-axis the nuclei were visualised. The gates for “Normal

43

Emmi Kuokkanen
Nuclei” and 2n-polyploidy were created to exclude all events but the nuclei. e) From the 2npolyploidy population the pH3-positive cells were identified with FL2-A on the y-axis and
FL3-A on the x-axis. The gate for pH3 positive cells was named “pH3_POS” f) A logical gate
of “Normal Nuclei” excluding the “pH3_POS” cells were used to identify the nuclei that
express γH2AX. These events were gated using FL4-A on the y-axis and FL3-A on the x-axis.
g) Similarly, from the same logical population the nuclei expressing p53 were identified with
FL1-A on the y-axis and FL3-A on the x-axis.

3.1.2 Analysing genotoxicity in TK6 cells using flow cytometry
Results for genotoxic prediction of flow cytometric analyses with TK6 cells are
presented in table 8. The lowest effective concentration (LEC) and lowest precipitating
concentration (LPC) are presented. For each concentration of each compound, the
relative nuclei count (RNC, fold of pH3, γH2AX and p53 were counted as a fold
increase compared to the average of negative controls. For a compound to be classified
as genotoxic, the GEF introduced by Bryce et al. (2017), described in chapter 1.7.2.4,
was used (Bryce et al., 2017). In addition, if RNC dropped below 0.2, the
concentration was considered cytotoxic, and these values were excluded. Precipitating
concentrations were taken into consideration as described in chapter 2.4. In addition
to the results presented in the table, for mitomycin C and amiodarone the highest
concentration tested was dependent of solubility properties, for cytosine arabinoside
the lowest tested concentration gave a genotoxic result and CCCP and imipramine
were cytotoxic at 75 µM and 250 µM correspondingly. Rotenone gave a false positive
result.

3.1.3 Analysing genotoxicity in HepG2 cells using flow cytometry
Flow cytometric data with HepG2 cells were analysed using the same criteria as for
TK6 cells except for that RNC having a value less than 0.5 being excluded (discussed
in detail in section 4.3). Issues with sample acquisition by flow cytometry occurred
with HepG2 cells which resulted in largely variable cell numbers and, therefore,
exclusion of several concentrations. Inconsistent wells where cell or bead counts
differed from the normal distribution were excluded. The LECs where not calculated
due to several concentration ranges being excluded from analysis. The classification
of compounds using GEFs with HepG2 cells are stated in table 9. Carryover between
samples was also considered and the results are, therefore, not considered accurate.
Further comparison between TK6 cells and HepG2 cells with flow cytometry was not
made.

3.2 Using high content analysis to measure genotoxicity
Before the high content analysis method was used to measure genotoxicity in HepG2
cells the steps of the method were determined. The results for antibody concentrations
and co-incubations (multiplex) for the markers γH2AX, pH3 and p53 are presented.
Following, the image analysis for the markers and the raw data is presented before
proceeding to the genotoxicity results for the 16 reference compounds in HepG2 cells.

3.2.1 HCA assay setup
To analyse the markers γH2AX, pH3 and p53 by imaging, antibody concentrations for
each marker were determined by analysing the fluorescence intensities from images
stained with different concentrations of antibodies. The control treatments used for
antibody determinations were 200 µM MMS, 12 nM vinblastine and 10 µM nutlin-3.
The antibodies were diluted in a way that the detection intensity of Operetta was not
exceeded and could be clearly distinguished from the background. The dilution of
Hoechst 33342 was not tested separately, since the 1 µg/ml was found to be a suitable
concentration based on another in-house assay. The concentrations chosen and the
intensity histograms are shown for all channels in figure 11 a-h. The final
concentrations chosen for each primary antibody was 1:1000 for γH2AX and pH3, and
1:300 for p53 (Novus). All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500.
First multiplexes were done with primary antibodies γH2AX and pH3 and the
secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, respectively. All wells showed
results as expected, wells stained with γH2AX and anti-mouse secondary antibody,
pH3 and anti-rabbit secondary antibody or only secondary antibodies showed no
signal. Wells stained with all of the antibodies at the same time showed increases in
total signals as predicted, vinblastine treated wells showed an increase in pH3 and
MMS treated wells an increase in γH2AX (figure 12). The staining patterns for both
markers were also identical to the examples shown in figure 11 c and e. Based on these
results the multiplex of these four antibodies was considered successful.

pictures in the left panel were acquired with Operetta 20x water immersion objective. In the
right panel histograms for each channel are presented with the number of pixels on the y-axis
and the intensity of the fluorescence on the x-axis. For better visualisation of the markers the

DNA. d) Intensity of DyLight550 represented by the orange curve. e) Image from a well
treated with 12 nM vinblastine, stained with pH3 primary antibody diluted to 1:1000 and antimouse secondary antibody diluted 1:500, imaged with Alexa488 channel. Each stained
nucleus represents a cell in mitosis. f) Intensity of Alexa488 represented by the green curve.
g) Image from a well treated with 10 µM Nutlin-3, stained with Novus p53 primary antibody
diluted to 1:300 and anti-Goat secondary antibody diluted 1:500, imaged with Alexa647
channel. Nutlin-3 promotes the localisation of p53 to the nucleus where the highest intensities
can be visualised. Presence of p53 in the cytoplasm can be detected with a weaker intensity.
h) Intensity of Alexa 647 represented by the red curve.

from the treatment. b) Wells treated with 20 µM MMS show an increased number of cells

Emmi Kuokkanen
Adding the primary p53 antibody and anti-goat secondary antibody to the multiplexing
scheme resulted in that unspecific binding was observed. It was noticed that the
secondary antibodies anti-rabbit and anti-mouse were produced in goat, which resulted
in binding of the anti-Goat secondary antibody to both of the other secondary
antibodies. This resulted in the decision to stain p53 on another plate. The plates where
therefore done in duplicates, with one plate stained with Hoechst, γH2AX and pH3
and the other one with Hoechst and p53.

3.2.2 Image analysis for HCA
In order to obtain the raw data from the images an image analysis template was created
in Columbus image analysis software from Perkin Elmer. The analysis was made
based on the same criteria as used for flow cytometry. First, using Hoechst 33342
channel the nuclei were identified by the algorithm “Find Nuclei”. The parameters
used were “Diameter” 30 µm2, “Splitting sensitivity” and “Threshold 0.3” (figure 13
a). From the “Nuclei” population a new population with removed border objects were
created, excluding all items that were located partly outside the frames. This “Nuclei
Selected” population was used for all further analyses (figure 13 b). To identify pH3positive nuclei, the intensity properties of Alexa 488 were calculated from the nuclei.
Based on these intensities in positive and negative controls, all nuclei with a mean
Alexa 488 intensity >1000 were marked pH3 positive nuclei. Similarly, a population
with mean Alexa 488 <1000 was created and marked “pH3 negative” (Figure 14).
From the “pH3 negative” population of nuclei the mean intensity of DyLight550 was
calculated and named γH2AX intensity. For p53 which was tested on a separate plate,
the same steps for “Nuclei selected” population were made. From this population the
mean intensity for Alexa 647 was calculated. The image analysis was performed on

3.2.3 Raw data handling for genotoxicity determination in HCA
Each 384-well plate measured by HCA contained the selected 16 reference
compounds studied at duplicates for every concentration. All plates were stained for
Hoechst and either for γH2AX and pH3 or p53. The 4- and 24-hour timepoint plates
for γH2AX and pH3 were replicated in three experiments. The p53-stained plates were
done in one replicate for 4 hours and two replicates for 24 hours. In addition, one plate
with a 48-hour incubation was measured after noticing that a 24-hour incubation was
in several cases not sufficient for γH2AX expression. For all plates, 16 wells with only
DMSO treatment served as the negative controls. The calculations described in chapter
2.7.3 were adapted for all wells. The amount of data points for each compound at each
concentration for every marker is presented in table 10. This applied for all other
compounds, excluding those compounds which had an adjusted concentration. For
these the data points may vary from two to four. The median used for analysis, as well
as the MAD were counted from these data points. The MAD for each value presented
as error bars in the graphs in appendix B. Two separate RNC values are also counted
for each concentration, one from the plate stained for γH2AX and pH3 and one from
the plate stained for p53. It was also noted that the p53 intensities were counted from
all nuclei in HCA, as an exception from MultiFlow, where the pH3-positive nuclei
were excluded.

Table 10, the amount of data points for each compound at each concentration for all the
marker used for analysis in HepG2 cells in HCA. In the upper column are the three
timepoints analysed in this study and on the right-hand side the three calculated marker folds.
For example, with the 4-hour incubations there were three plates stained with γH2AX and
pH3, and as all concentrations were found in duplicates there are 6 data points for both
γH2AX- and pH3-folds for each compound at each concentration. The 48-hour incubations
on the other hand were done without replicates and, therefore, there are only 2 datapoints for
each marker.

For the γH2AX- and pH3-stained plates, the positive controls for vinblastine and
MMS were also analysed to verify that the controls and thereby the whole experiment
was successful. The p53-stained plates were handled in the same experiments and
assumed to be identical in terms of compound handling and fixation performed by
automation. The staining steps were performed manually and as the p53 marker could
be seen in the images these plates were also considered successful. It was, however,
noted that one of the 24-hour plates had a decrease in γH2AX shift for MMS control
but since the results for the reference compounds were in line with the other plates this
plate was not discarded. Variation may have been caused by a pipetting error as the
MMS control had a different liquid class than the other control compounds (MMS was
diluted in H2O and the other compounds in DMSO) or the control stock used could
have been more diluted due to a pipetting error.
The first plate measured was incubated for 24 hours and it was noticed that
concentrations of some compounds needed to be adjusted, for example vinblastine did
not cause an increase in pH3 signal at the same concentrations as in TK6 cells and was
increased for the next test. As the suggested RNC value for HepG2 cells in
genotoxicity testing is higher than for TK6 cells (discussed more in detail in section
4.3), some concentrations resulted in a cytotoxic effect earlier and the starting
concentration was reduced. It was also observed that some compounds were
precipitating at lower concentrations possibly as a cause of repeated freeze and thaw
cycles. Fresh samples were made for precipitating samples and the precipitation was
determined for each plate separately. These adjustments can be observed in the results
as some of the compounds have more or less concentration-data points than others. As
the RNC values were counted separately for each plate, the values for the markers
presented later are provided only if the RNC is above threshold for the plate in question
for that concentration.

3.2.4 Results with HepG2 cells in HCA
For HepG2 cells the results from genotoxicity testing by HCA were plotted in graphs
to visualise the markers in relation to the concentrations for each compound. As an
example, the non-genotoxicant NaCl is shown here as baseline (figure 15). The values
for γH2AX and pH3 and the RNC from these plates were plotted in one graph and the
values for p53 and RNC from those plates on another. The folds for γH2AX are
represented by orange lines, the fold of pH3 as green lines and the fold of p53 as red
lines. Each line represents a different time-point, the lightest for 4 hours and darkest
for 48 hours. The scale for the genotoxicity markers is presented on the y-axis to the
left and is represented as a fold to the negative control. The RNC is represented as
grey lines and the scale is on the y-axis on the right side of the graph. The
concentrations are presented on the x-axis in a logarithmic scale. The scale on the
graphs showing the results for the same compounds are the same for clarity. Results
for all compounds can be found in appendix A. Precipitated concentrations are not
shown in the graphs. Further, some of the data from HCA is shown in section 3.3, in
comparison with results from TK6 cells in MultiFlow.

lines indicate the genotoxicity markers γH2AX (orange), pH3(green) (upper graph) and p53
(red) (lower graph). Grey lines represent the RNC. The MAD is shown as y-error bars for each
data point. The baseline for the markers lies around 1 (scale on the left-hand side) and no
significant fold increases or decreases can be seen for any of the markers as is expected for a
non-genotoxicant. RNC baseline also lies around 1 but is set higher for clarity (scale on the
right-hand side).

3.2.4 Determination of thresholds for genotoxicity
From the medians of the 4-hour and 24-hour data a range of different criteria and
thresholds were tested to see which could predict the genotoxicity of the compounds
most precisely. The different combinations of thresholds were based on criteria used
for MultiFlow and previous studies of genotoxicity testing using HepG2 cells
(Khoury, Zalko, & Audebert, 2016c). The comparisons were performed in Excel by a
system where different criteria were tested on all compounds at the same time. In the
same way as with the GEFs, for a compound to be considered as an aneugen or a
clastogen, two of the criteria needed to be met at two continuous concentrations. The
criteria tested are presented in table 11. For each set of criteria, the prediction was
counted as a score. Each compound predicted correctly, according to previous
classifications described in the literature (as indicated in table 1), gave a score of 1,
resulting in a maximum score of 16. Using these reference compounds, the prediction
of endpoints at rows 5 and 8 in table 11 gave the best predictivity with 15/16
compounds determined correctly. In both cases the one compound with an inaccurate
prediction was BAP which did not elevate the γH2AX response sufficiently at these
timepoints as seen in the previous section. Both of these models did not include p53
as a marker which in the case for example CCCP indicated a false positive response
using criteria 1 and 2.
As previously mentioned, it was seen that the 4-hour incubation plate did not increase
the γH2AX response in several clastogens in HepG2 in the same way as in TK6 cells,
and therefore, the 4-hour timepoint was suspected to be too short for γH2AX
expression in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 48-hour incubation plate was also
incorporated in the analysis and data was analysed from these three timepoints in
parallel. With 3 timepoints a strategy where at least 2 out of 3 criteria were met gave
the best results. For aneugens, thresholds based on MultiFlow was used, a pH3
increase 1.71-fold at 4 hours, 1.52-fold at 24 hours and, in addition, 1.52-fold at 48
hours. For clastogens, the thresholds for γH2AX increase at 4 hours and 24 hours was
1.3-fold and for 48 hours 2.11-fold, as in MultiFlow. The RNC threshold for 4 hours
was kept at 0.5 and decreased to 0.2 for 24 and 48 hours. By this strategy, all
compounds could be identified correctly, even BAP.

3.3 Comparison of MultiFlow with TK6 cells and HCA with HepG2
cells
For a more detailed comparison between the cell lines, the results from MultiFlow
with TK6 cells were plotted in graphs. The same plotting logic was used in these
graphs as described previously with HepG2 cells in HCA. The same reference
compound NaCl, which is a non-genotoxicant, is shown in figure 16 as baseline.
Values for γH2AX and pH3 are represented in one graph together with RNC for those
plates (represented as lines for the 4-hour and 24-hour incubations separately) and p53
values with RNC for those plates separately in another graph. Genotoxicity markers
(γH2AX, pH3 and p53) are presented as fold increase relatively to negative controls
as described previously and are plotted on the y axis to the left. RNC are plotted on
the y-axis on the right-hand side and the concentration series on the x-axis as a
logarithmic scale. All data for the studied compounds can be found in appendix A for
TK6 cells and appendix B for HepG2 cells.
For a better overview, the genotoxicity markers γH2AX, pH3 and p53 for all
timepoints studied were visualised in spider plots to allow for a comparison of all
compounds using the two different methods (figure 17). For simplicity, RNC values
and the distribution of data are not shown in these graphs. The same compound in the
two different methods is presented next to each other, with the data from MultiFlow
with HepG2 cells on the right-hand side and the data from HCA with HepG2 cells on
the left-hand side. In the plots the concentration series is presented as lines, with the
darkest line representing the highest concentration (as indicated at the bottom of the
graphs).

lines indicate the genotoxicity markers γH2AX (yellow), pH3(green) (upper graph) and p53

is shown as y-error bars for each data point. The baseline for the markers lies around 1 (scale
on the left-hand side) and no significant fold increases or decreases can be seen for any of the
markers as is expected for a non-genotoxicant. RNC baseline lies around 1 but is set higher
for clarity (scale on the right-hand side).

Figure 17, Comparison of expression of genotoxicity markers at different time points in
TK6 cells by flow cytometry and HepG2 cells by HCA. Spider plots are used to visualise
the expression of the markers γH2AX, pH3 and p53 (as fold changes related to negative
controls) in TK6 cells and HepG2 cells. The plots for TK6 cells are on the left-hand side and
for HepG2 cells on the right-hand side, to allow for easier comparison of the same compound.
In the upper right are the fold changes of pH3 at all studied timepoints, at the bottom the fold
changes of γH2AX and in the upper left the fold changes of p53. The plots are not completely
identical since one additional timepoint is included for HepG2 cells. The concentration series
are the lines plotted on the graph and the values are presented at the bottom. The darkest lines
represent the highest concentrations. The colour of the lines represents the prediction for the
compound for the cell line in question (green = aneugen, orange = clastogen, grey = non
genotoxicant. In addition, mitomycin C in TK6 cells is shaded in a deeper colour to note the
difference in p53 expression.) As some compounds had differing concentrations at different
timepoints and tests, the lines of some plots have gaps. The corresponding data can be found
in another format in Appendix A and B.

Emmi Kuokkanen
For all aneugens, paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine, a correspondence in pH3folds at both 4-hour and 24-hour timepoints was seen. As one example, in cells treated
with paclitaxel increases in pH3 were present in both cell lines at 4 hours and 24 hours,
but some difference could be seen in the sensitivity. In HepG2 cells, the signal at the
4-hour timepoint increased at a lower concentration, which also could be seen with the
other aneugens, while the response at the 24-hour timepoint was seen first at a higher
concentration. On the contrary, in TK6 cells the pH3-folds increased at the same
concentration at both time points. At the 48-hour timepoint the pH3 marker was no
longer seen for vinblastine and paclitaxel but persisted in colchicine. The p53-folds in
the aneugens also showed a good correspondence, except for paclitaxel, where the
p53-fold increased over threshold at 0.04 µM in TK6 cells at the 24-hour timepoint,
but no similar effect was seen in HepG2 cells.
For the clastogens, the increase in γH2AX-fold at 4 hours was significantly lower in
HepG2 cells for all compounds. The 24-hour γH2AX-folds from HepG2 cells were
more comparable with the 4-hour folds from TK6 cells and the 48-hour folds from
HepG2 with the 24-hour folds from TK6. This can be seen for most of the clastogens
in figure 17 as the peaks of γH2AX at 4 hours in TK6 cells corresponds better with
the peaks at 24 hours in HepG2 cells, and correspondingly the peaks at 24 hours in
TK6 cells corresponds with the peaks at 48 hours in HepG2 cells. The effective
concentration was also in many cases higher in HepG2 cells than TK6 cells, for
example with MMS. In addition, for MMS an interesting phenomenon could be
noticed. A steady rise of γH2AX expression in correspondence to the concentration
could be seen in TK6 cells, while the increase in HepG2 peaked at higher
concentrations. In the TK6 cells the increase in γH2AX expression was measured
around 30 µM while in HepG2 the corresponding concentration was around 200 µM.
For the 48-hour timepoint, a subthreshold concentration was mostly likely the reason
for a lack of response. Apart from this difference in concentrations, the response
detected in the markers correspond well. As the γH2AX markers increased, a decrease
in the fold change of pH3 could also be seen in both cell lines for all timepoints. For
p53 there was no evident change in either cell line. A difference in the HepG2 cells
could also be seen for BAP which showed an increase in γH2AX-folds at 24 and 48
hours. The pH3-decrease and a slight increase in nuclear p53 could also be seen at

67

Emmi Kuokkanen
these same concentrations. In TK6 cells no similar expression was seen for any of the
markers.
The p53-folds for all compounds, except for mitomycin C showed no significant
increases affecting the classification of the compounds. With mitomycin C the
different expression of p53 was evident as seen in figure 17. The increase was much
more evident in TK6 cells than in HepG2 cells. A small increase could be seen at 24
hours in HepG2 cells but at 48 hours the signal was no longer detected. This did,
however, not affect the classification since the γH2AX response could be seen in both
cell lines. A p53-shift could in many cases be witnessed in correspondence with a
decrease in RNC, as in CCCP, colchicine and 4QNO. In TK6 cells the p53-folds at 24
hours increased for these compounds in a manner not seen in HepG2 cells, although a
slight elevation could be seen for the marker.
The only false positive in TK6 cells, rotenone, showed a difference in the expression
of pH3 markers at all timepoints. For TK6 cells the increases in pH3-fold were evident
at both 4 hours and 24 hours and labelled the compound as an aneugen. In HepG2 cells
no similar pH3-fold increase could be seen at these timepoints but in contrast, at 24
hours a decrease in pH3 is seen at all concentrations studied. The same phenomenon
was seen at 48 hours, with the drastic change at 30 µM when the pH3-fold increased
considerably. This increase was, however, coupled with a drop in RNC below 0.2 and
therefore the exceptionally high values were not taken into consideration in
genotoxicity analysis. A fold increase in p53 could also be seen especially at the
cytotoxic concentrations.
Overall, the RNC for TK6 cells decreased for most of the compounds at a lower
concentration than for HepG2 cells and a corresponding p53-increase could be seen
for several compounds, for example in sertraline, imipramine, rotenone, Nimesulide
and 2,4-dinitrophenol.
In the spider plots, differences in marker expression between various classes of
genotoxins can also be seen. For the aneugens for example, in paclitaxel the highest
increase in pH3 is seen after 4 hours, while with colchicine the increase is more evident
after 24 hours. For vinblastine, the increase is also higher after 4 hours, but the
expression decreases more rapidly after 24 hours than for paclitaxel. For the clastogens
similar differences can be seen, for example for 4NQO in TK6 cells, the γH2AX
68

Emmi Kuokkanen
expression is higher after 4 hours than the corresponding concentration after 24 hours,
in contrast to cytosine arabinoside in TK6 cells, where the response after 24 hours is
higher than that detected after 4 hours.
For most of the compounds the patterns of studied markers for genotoxicity were
similar between the two cell lines studied (with the assumption, that for the γH2AX
marker, the 48-hour timepoint in HepG2 cells corresponds with the 24-hour timepoint
in TK6 cells and likewise the 24-hour timepoint in HepG2 with the 4-hour timepoint
in TK6). Differences in marker expression can be clearly seen for mitomycin C, BAP
and rotenone. Some deviation can also be seen for vinblastine, 4NQO and cytosine
arabinoside, mainly at the different timepoints when markers are expressed.
A concluding prediction for the two studied cell lines using two different methods is
presented in table 12. For TK6 cells the only criteria used were the GEFs, which
resulted in a predictivity of 87.5% (with a specificity of 87.5% and sensitivity of
87.5%). The one false negative was BAP, which, as seen from figure 17, did not cause
expression of any of the genotoxicity markers. The false positive rotenone in contrary
showed increases in pH3 as described previously and was predicted as an aneugen.
For the HCA method a 100% predictivity could be established using the 3-timepoint
criteria as discussed previously. With the GEFs as comparison the sensitivity was only
62.5%, with MMS, cytosine arabinoside and BAP predicted as false negatives. As
seen from figure 17 the γH2AX response for all of these compounds was not evident
at 4 hours. With these criteria CCCP was also classified as a false positive leading to
a specificity of 87.5% and an overall predictivity of 75%.

Table 12, Prediction of genotoxicity using different criteria for TK6 cells in flow
cytometry and HepG2 cells in HCA. The genotoxic compounds are grouped on the top of
the table and the sensitivity is counted based on the prediction of genotoxic properties of these.
Likewise, the specificity is counted based on the prediction of non-genotoxic compounds. For
TK6 cells, the only criteria used for the evaluation was the GEFs. For HepG2 cells, the same
GEFs are used as a comparison and, in addition, the criteria provided by Khoury et al. (column
8 in table 10) and criteria based on three timepoints. The overall predictivity is evaluated based
on the combination of sensitivity and specificity.

4. Discussion
4.1 Comparison between cell lines based on flow cytometry
One of the major issues in this study was the inconclusive results with HepG2 cells in
MultiFlow, which did not allow for a proper comparison between the cell lines using
the same method. This was an unexpected drawback, since the protocol of the
MultiFlow®-kit suggests the use of HepG2 cells in case adherent cells are used. Based
on the first attempts to measure HepG2 cells with the flow cytometer it seemed that
the cells were not properly detaching from the plate. Change of solution to the same
trypsin used in subculturing did not improve the result. A prolonged incubation with
Accutase® and proper flushing of the wells resulted in lower variation in cell number
between wells. When analysing multiple wells, issues with well identification
occurred, most likely due to clogging of the sampler and carryover between samples.
The issue was attempted to be resolved by adding several washes between sample
acquisition but despite that, some clogging and carryover was seen in each run. Since
one experiment was run on four plates and the clogging occurred towards the end of
the run, some of the samples could be analysed to a certain extent. For the most potent
genotoxins, as indicated in TK6 cells, a correspondence between TK6 and HepG2 cells
was seen and the cell line was considered eligible for genotoxicity testing, as indicated
in literature (Kopp, Zalko, & Audebert, 2018) (Ando, Yoshikawa, Iwase, & Ishiura,
2014). Based on the results from MultiFlow with HepG2 cells, it seemed that the
concentration range used was not sufficient for γH2AX expression with some of the
clastogens, such as MMS and mitomycin C and the concentration of those compounds
were therefore elevated, if allowed by solubility properties. Similarly, some
compounds, if not precipitating or expressing genotoxic or cytotoxic properties, were
retested in TK6 cells up to 1 mM (or the highest solubility), as indicated by ICH
guidelines (Food and Drug Administration, HHS, 2012). Further comparison between
TK6 cells and HepG2 cells using flow cytometry was not performed.

4.2 The role of p53 as a genotoxicity marker
When analysing the HCA data of HepG2 cells the meaningfulness of p53 as a
genotoxicity marker was questioned. Genotoxicity criteria for HepG2 cells in
literature were in most cases limited to fold increases in phosphorylation of pH3 and
71

Emmi Kuokkanen
γH2AX (Khoury et al., 2016) (Kopp et al., 2018) (Khoury et al., 2016) (Smart, D. J.,
Ahmedi, Harvey, & Lynch, 2011). Despite its role in inducing apoptosis as a
consequence of DNA damage, p53 is believed to also be involved in responses
triggered by several other types of cellular stress (Reaves et al., 2000) (Brooks & Gu,
2010). For the compounds used in this experiment, p53 was not a critical marker but
increases in p53-folds could be seen mostly for cytotoxic concentrations in HepG2
cells. For example, if using GEFs in HepG2 cells the p53 increase at 4 and 24 hours
falsely predicted for example CCCP to be genotoxic. Some variation was also seen
between plates, as indicated by the error bars in the p53 graphs. It is evident from the
images that the translocation of p53 was more pronounced on some plates than others.
In addition, for some reason, one of the plates had a much larger number of cells in
the wells used as negative controls, resulting in a lower RNC count for the 4-hour
plates and a large variation between samples. Based on the two first experiments, as
the p53 did not seem to have an effect in the outcome with these compounds, the
experiments were not replicated in triplicates. The plate incubated for 48 hours was
studied at the end of this project as an additional timepoint but there was some
precipitation, most likely from the p53 antibody itself, seen in the images. As there
was not enough antibody left to retest the p53 expression after a 48-hour incubation to
confirm the result, it was not included in this study. Importance of p53 as an indicator
of genotoxicity remained inconclusive for these compounds. Generally, on one hand,
some atypical genotoxic compounds, such as the clastogen 5-Fluorouracil which is a
typical reference compound, do not cause a significant γH2AX increase
(MultiFlow(R).). 5-Fluorouracil does instead cause an increase in p53 and, therefore,
would possibly go undetected as a false negative without the use of p53 (Bryce,
Bernacki, Bemis, & Dertinger, 2016). On the other hand, some compounds, such as
Nutlin-3, which is not classified as a genotoxicant, cause increases in p53 and would
therefore be classified as a clastogen based on the GEF criteria. In HepG2 cells, it also
seemed that the cytotoxic compounds induced a p53 increase prior to cell death
(measured as RNC) and, therefore, could also induce false positive results for
cytotoxicants. To be able to determine if p53 brings a value to an imaging-based
analysis a larger number of compounds and a more detailed image analysis should be
considered.

72

Another aspect that could be considered is the replacement of p53 in the imaging
analysis. The advantage of an image-based analysis is the ability to analyse the images
for several markers and endpoints at intracellular levels. In this way, the relevance of
the p53 marker could decrease if a combination of other markers would provide a
better prediction. For clastogenic compounds, other proteins involved in the DDR
response have also been suggested. In one study, Kopp et al. used a variety of proteins
involved in the DDR as markers in order to study if a combination of markers could
provide insight into the mode of action of clastogens (Kopp, Dario, Zalko, & Audebert,
2018). In their study, they reported that the phosphorylated form of p53 at Serine15
corresponded better with γH2AX response than nuclear p53 (Kopp et al., 2018). This
suggests that the phosphorylated form at this residue of p53 would potentially be a
better marker. However, from the compounds they tested, the γH2AX response was
present with all compounds at 24- or 48-hour timepoints, including 5-Fluorouracil.
Therefore, the value of p53 as an indicator for clastogenicity in HepG2 cells was not
seen based on their data either.

4.3 Genotoxicity criteria in different cell lines
As discussed previously, the GEFs for TK6 cells have been established by an
interlaboratory study with a large number of reference compounds and data from
several laboratories (Bryce et al., 2017). A similar comprehensive validation has not
been performed for HepG2 cells and, therefore, the genotoxicity criteria for these cells
needed to be adapted. As mentioned previously, the nuclear p53-fold marker has not
been as widely used in HepG2 cells and, therefore, a similar set of criteria as the GEFs
in TK6 cells was difficult to establish. The endpoint was, therefore, to find criteria that
could predict the genotoxicity of the compounds, as described in the literature, as
accurately as possible. The first endpoint in the criteria was the cytotoxicity threshold.
Although many of the criteria described previously used a cytotoxicity of 50%
measured as RNC in HepG2 cells, it was noted that other thresholds could change the
outcome of the results. Based on the cytotoxicity levels of TK6 and HepG2 cells it
seemed that the HepG2 cells were more tolerable to toxic compounds seen by a higher
survival (measured as RNC), at least by these methods. It could also be beneficial to
use a relative population doubling (RPD) count, in addition to the RNC count, to be
able to determine cytotoxicity correctly. The RPD could potentially have provided
73

Emmi Kuokkanen
better information on the doubling time of the HepG2 cells, which was not separately
tested here. The combination of a longer doubling time and the tolerance of the HepG2
cells could have been the reason for the delay in the γH2AX response and, therefore,
the longer 48-hour incubation might be necessary to determine genotoxic properties
of compounds. At the 48-hour timepoint, however, the RNC of 50% as threshold led
to an exclusion of a large number of samples. The lowering of the threshold to 20% at
this timepoint led to a better prediction and was therefore considered. To assess an
optimal incubation time and the cytotoxicity limit a wider range of timepoints between
24 and 48 hours should be further evaluated.
For the other markers used, the thresholds of the criteria should be considered
critically. The 1.3-fold increase used by Khoury et al. is significantly lower than that
of the GEFs in TK6 cells, which can lead to false positive results. On the other hand,
a threshold set too high can lead to genotoxicity remaining undetected for less potent
compounds, or compounds which have an atypical genotoxic response. The decrease
in pH3 was also one aspect considered. As seen from the data, the γH2AX response
was coupled to a decrease of pH3 for most of the compounds. This decrease is most
likely coupled to the DDR response of the damage where the cell cycle progression is
inhibited, and the cells are not able to enter mitosis. However, a decrease in pH3 could
also be a cause of an aneugen. As previously discussed, many aneugens disturb the
mitotic kinases. A compound that inhibits the Aurora kinase, which is responsible for
pH3 phosphorylation, would lead to a depletion of pH3. In this case, a combination of
pH3 decrease and γH2AX increase would indicate a clastogenic action, while a steeper
decrease would indicate an aneugenic action. The mechanisms behind the genotoxic
effects would, therefore, also be an interesting and important subject of study in order
to be able to better classify the compounds based on the thresholds. A combination of
several markers could enhance the sensitivity and specificity of testing, both by more
accurate predictions and by excluding false positives and negatives.
Overall, the aim of the criteria is to be able to predict the genotoxic properties of
compounds as accurately as possible. For example, if a compound expresses cytotoxic
properties of more than 50% in vitro, does its genotoxic potential at these
concentrations have any meaning in vivo? Most of the guidelines of genotoxicity
testing are based on the OECD guidelines, mainly of the micronucleus assay and
previous classification of compounds. Therefore, whichever criteria are used should
74

Emmi Kuokkanen
be consistent with both guidelines and an accurate prediction of previously classified
compounds.

4.4 Improvements to HCA platform
Based on the experiments done in this study, the imaging platform would provide a
promising alternative for genotoxicity testing, but the method and models need to be
further developed. The concentration series used in HCA was chosen based on
automation of the method but could be more optimal if a 20-point dilution series with
a dilution factor of e.g. 1.4 would be implicated, especially if the same criteria of two
continuous concentrations are used. An optimisation of incubation times could provide
an alternative to using two instead of three different plates with three timepoints.
HepG2 cells have been used successively in several earlier genotoxicity testing studies
and were therefore chosen to be used here (Khoury et al., 2016) (Garcia-Canton et al.,
2013). However, the cell line used for HCA could also be re-considered. The longer
doubling time of HepG2 cells most likely was one of the reasons for a delayed γH2AX
response and the need of a third, longer incubation time. The metabolic activity of
HepG2 cells was also not as evident as expected. The assumption was that the cells
expressed enzymes capable of phase-I and phase-II metabolism and, therefore, also
could predict genotoxicity of compounds requiring metabolic activation (Westerink et
al., 2011). This was seen to some extent with BAP, although the increase in γH2AXfold was seen only slightly and mostly after a 48-hour incubation. No similar increase
in the TK6 cells was seen, so this would indicate that there is some metabolic activity
in the HepG2 cells used. The metabolic activity in the cell line used is an advantage
since it could predict the genotoxicity of metabolites of compounds which also would
be formed in the liver in vivo. The HepG2 cells also have a competent p53 which is
dysfunctional in many other malignant cell lines. The functional p53 is a presumption
if the p53 marker is used but it also has an important function in the DDR and,
therefore, is an important factor in genotoxicity screening (Westerink et al., 2011). A
cell line considered for further testing would therefore preferably be a metabolically
active human cell line with a functional p53, form micronuclei upon DNA damage, be
an adherent cell line suitable for imaging and preferably have a more rapid doubling
time, as with TK6 cells.
One additional endpoint that could be considered in image analysis would be the
formation of micronuclei. As the micronucleus test is still one of the main studies in
75

Emmi Kuokkanen
determination of genotoxic properties, the formation of micronuclei could most likely
conveniently be detected in HCA (Westerink et al., 2011). This was one endpoint that
was considered for the image analysis but the micronucleus formation in HepG2 cells
was not as evident and the resolution of the images or the amount of cells imaged was
most likely not adequate for this purpose. With some compounds the formation of
micronuclei could, however, be seen in the images. For example, with vinblastine and
mitomycin C, which are micronucleus positive compounds, the formation of
micronuclei could be seen (figure 18) (Kirkland et al., 2016). The micronuclei can be
identified as small fragments of DNA in close proximity to the main nucleus and
could, therefore, also be considered to be included in the image analysis. The
micronuclei are also in many cases shown to express γH2AX phosphorylation,
regardless of the mechanism which causes the formation (Watters, Smart, Harvey, &
Austin, 2009). In other words, the γH2AX response in micronuclei can be seen also
for aneugens, which are otherwise detected by pH3. Since the micronuclei do not
require any additional marker than the Hoechst dye and possibly γH2AX in assisting
the identification, the addition of micronucleus identification to HCA analysis could
provide further insight into the genotoxic potential of the compounds.

4.5 Advantages of HepG2 cells in genotoxicity screenings
The 16 reference compounds studied showed a good prediction of genotoxic
properties by imaging of HepG2 cells, even though some of the compounds were
chosen on a basis of a possibly false positive result. One of these was rotenone, which
was predicted as an aneugen in flow cytometry with TK6 cells. Rotenone is known to
act as mitochondrial toxin by inhibiting complex 1 in the respiratory chain and,
therefore, leads to cytotoxicity by energy deprivation (Heinz et al., 2017b). Some
mitochondrial toxins are of particular interest in genotoxicity testing, since the energy
deprivation might also cause dysfunctions in DDR and cell cycle progression, thereby
leading to a misleading positive genotoxicity result (Tsai et al., 2020). The
mitochondrial toxins Nimesulide, amiodarone and 2,4-dinitrophenol were therefore of
particular interest. Surprisingly, none of the mitochondrial toxins showed genotoxicity
using the HCA method with HepG2 cells. This could possibly be explained by the
growth medium of HepG2 cells which was high in glucose and could provide an
alternative mechanism for energy production, based on glycolysis (Kamalian et al.,
2015). This could also partially explain the effect of rotenone seen after a 48-hour
incubation. As long as the cells have glucose to utilise for their energy needs the
defects in mitochondria do not affect the cells, but as soon as the glucose is consumed
the same effect that could be seen in TK6 cells at 4 hours is seen in HepG2 cells. The
glycolytic properties of HepG2 cells could therefore be seen as an advantage for
genotoxicity testing as the cells might not be as sensitive to mitochondrial toxins and
lead to a false positive genotoxic prediction as a consequence of this. Another
compound of interest was BAP, which becomes genotoxic upon metabolic activation.
For the longer incubation times an increase in γH2AX was seen, which would indicate
an expression of the metabolic enzymes CYP1A1, 1B1 and1A2, involved in BAP
metabolism (Shah et al., 2016). For improved determination, the metabolic capabilities
and enzymes involved should be measured for the cell line. An optimal cell line would
express all the relevant CYP enzymes involved in metabolism of compounds.

4.6 Further perspectives
For further perspectives, the method used here would need to be adjusted and a
significantly larger number of compounds would need to be tested to be able to predict
if an imaging-based platform could be used for a more accurate prediction. Several
authorities, including the EURL ECVAM (EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives
to animal testing), provide a comprehensive recommended list of genotoxic and nongenotoxic chemicals suitable for validation of genotoxicity tests (Kirkland et al.,
2016). Based on data from a larger validation test set, more powerful image analysis
platforms and mathematical models could be used to analyse a larger amount of data
form the samples and possibly even provide insight into the mechanisms behind the
damage. As seen in the spider plots, different types of mechanisms behind the damage
cause different types of responses in the cells. These changes in pattern can be seen
by both flow cytometry and HCA and for the MultiFlow®-kit there has, in fact, been
suggested machine learning approaches for determination of the molecular targets
behind the damage (Dertinger et al., 2019) (Bernacki, Bryce, Bemis, & Dertinger,
2019). Especially for the aneugens, an approach where the assembly or disassembly
of the mitotic spindles or kinase inhibition mechanisms could be predicted by the use
of three markers (Bernacki et al., 2019). An imaging-based assay could be of
advantage for these types of analyses in the future, as the image analysis could possibly
provide even more insight into the state of the cell compared to flow cytometry. For
example, without any addition of markers, the properties of the nuclei, such as the
size, roundness and intensity, can provide insight into the health of the cell. Using
these properties, even the state of the cell cycle could possibly be determined. In
addition to this, the imaging-based assay could also provide insight into the
intracellular events, which is not always possible to the same extent by flow cytometry.
For example, markers for mitochondrial membrane potentials could be included to
measure the health of mitochondria. This could further reduce the misleading positives
which might be caused by energy deprivation rather than straight damage to the DNA.
Additional studies of the DNA damage pathways could reveal promising markers
involved in a response to genotoxins. For these, further studies are needed but an
imaging-based assay would provide a good platform for this type of studies. In
addition, a large number of commercially available fluorophores and the possibility to
image several markers on the same plate provide the opportunity to analyse several
78

Emmi Kuokkanen
endpoints and mechanisms. This, in combination with machine learning could provide
new information, opportunities and insights into the field of genotoxicity testing and
classification of compounds.

V CONCLUSIONS
The aim of this project was to compare the predictivity of high content in vitro methods
for genotoxicity in drug discovery. For this purpose, an imaging-based HCA assay
was successfully set up and tested using 16 reference compounds with known
genotoxic- or non-genotoxic properties. The results from the HCA assay with HepG2
cells were compared with the results from a flow cytometry-based assay with TK6
cells. A comparison between HepG2 cells and TK6 cells in the flow cytometry data
could not be done due to low quality data with HepG2 cells caused most likely by
aggregation of the cells during the protocol.
As a comparison between the cell lines using the same methods could not be
established and previous genotoxicity criteria for HepG2 cells was not validated, a
range of genotoxicity criteria was adapted based on literature and the known genotoxic
potential of the reference compounds used. Using two timepoints the criteria could
predict 15 out of 16 reference compounds correctly. For γH2AX expression a 4-hour
incubation did not seem sufficient, therefore, a 48-hour incubation was included. By
studying 3 timepoints all 16 compounds could be predicted correctly using the
following criteria: For aneugens, the criteria used were a pH3 increase over 1.71-fold
at 4 hours, 1.52-fold at 24 hours or 1.52-fold at 48 hours. For clastogens, the criteria
used were γH2AX increase over 1.3-fold at 4 hours, 1.3-fold at 24 hours or 2.11-fold
at 48 hours. Genotoxicity was indicated if at least two out of three of these were met
at two continuous concentrations, as well as the RNC was above 50% at 4 hours and
above 80% at 24 hours and 48 hours. With TK6 cells the criteria used were from a
previously validated study which predicted 14 out of 16 compounds correctly. The
genotoxicity endpoints in HepG2 cells did not include p53, which in some cases
instead gave a false positive result if included in the criteria.
In conclusion, based on the reference compounds tested, the HCA method seems to
provide a promising alternative for flow cytometry-based screening. The genotoxicity
markers γH2AX and pH3 were able to distinguish between aneugens and clastogens
in HepG2 cells. Genotoxic effects could even be detected for the compound BAP
requiring metabolic activity. However, to be able to determine more specific criteria
and the correct prediction for additional compounds a significantly larger validation
78

Emmi Kuokkanen
set is still necessary in order to confirm these results. The criteria for genotoxicity
should also be determined based on a larger validation set and better mathematical
models. In addition, some improvements and adjustments for the imaging assay should
be considered. Even though HepG2 cells showed promising results, some other cell
line with better properties should be considered for this assay.
To improve predictivity, the imaging platform provides some advantages over flow
cytometry. One of these is visualisation of intracellular events, such as mitochondrial
membrane potentials, which could allow for reduction of false positive interpretations
caused by energy deprivation. Another endpoint could be to study other molecules
involved in DNA damage responses and consider them as markers for genotoxicity.
In addition, the image analysis tools could allow for analysis of other genotoxicity
endpoints, such as micronuclei in the same test without addition of additional markers.
False negative results could also be excluded by using a metabolically active cell line.
The adaptation of machine learning, and additional markers could also provide insight
into the biological mechanisms of actions behind the damage. In conclusion, an
imaging-based genotoxicity screening method provides great promise in the field, but
further studies and development and still needed to take full advantage of all of the
potential of the method.

VI SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – Svensk sammanfattning
Jämförelse av screeningmetoder för genotoxicitet in vitro inom
läkemedelsindustrin
Toxikologisk testning är viktigt inom alla branscher som hanterar kemikalier av något
slag. Alla kemikalier som är avsedda att användas av människor eller djur är strikt
reglerade av myndigheterna. Inom läkemedelsindustrin testas alla potentiella
läkemedel för toxicitet av olika slag. Ett av dessa är genotoxicitet, studien om ämnen
som förorsakar skada på genomet, d.v.s. det ärftliga materialet DNA. Det finns flera
metoder som används för att detektera skador på DNA in vitro men nya, mer effektiva
metoder är ständigt eftertraktade. Ett av de största problemen med de nuvarande
metoderna är förekomsten av falska positiva resultat in vitro, vilket kan leda till
onödiga in vivo djurförsök, vilka är både dyra och etiskt ifrågasatta. Målsättningarna
för detta projekt var att sätta upp en metod baserad på visualisering genom högeffektiv
automatiserad mikroskopi (high content analysis, HCA) och att jämföra resultatet från
denna med metoder som används för tillfället.
Som jämförelse fungerade en metod baserad på flödescytometri, en metod där enskilda
celler i vätska passerar i ett flöde genom en laserstråle. På basis av ljuset som
reflekteras från cellerna, emissionen från fluorescerande antikroppar eller molekyler
som cellkomponenter färgats med, kan dessa detekteras genom en dator kopplad till
flödecytometern. De cellkomponenter som användes i denna studie var γH2AX, pH3
och p53. H2AX och H3 är båda histoner, molekyler som är tätt kopplade till DNA och
därmed även involverade i signalräckor som styr processer relaterade till DNA såsom
translation, replikation och reparation av skador. Då DNA:t utsätts för en skada
aktiveras en process som kollektivt kallas för DNA skaderespons (DNA damage
response, DDR). En molekyl som genomgår förändringar då DNA bryts på mitten är
H2AX som i detta fall fosforyleras och bildar γH2AX. Ifall ett ämne ger upphov till
skador på dubbelsträngen kan en ökning av halten γH2AX iakttas i cellerna. I motsats
till detta utgör fosforyleringen av H3 till pH3 en del av den normala cellcykeln. Denna
reaktion är kopplad till mitos, då DNA kondenseras inför celldelning fosforyleras H3
till pH3. Genast då cellen delat sig och DNA återvänder till ett mindre kondenserade
tillstånd defosforyleras även pH3. Genotoxicitet kan även bero på störningar i
fördelningen av DNA vid mitos, vilket kan leda till en ojämn distribution av
80

Emmi Kuokkanen
kromosomerna. Detta resulterar ofta i att cellerna blir kvar i mitos. Ett ämne som
förorsakar denna typ av skada ger därigenom upphov till en förlängd mitos som kan
iakttas som en ökning i pH3 expresserande celler. Utöver dessa två histonproteiner är
p53 ett protein som är involverat i DDR-responsen. Då en viss typ av skada sker
förflyttas p53 till cellkärnan där den aktiverar gener som är involverade i DNA:s
reparationsmekanismer. Förflyttningen av p53 från cytoplasman till kärnan kan på
grund av detta i vissa fall vara kopplad till genotoxicitet.
I denna studie användes 16 referensämnen antingen med kända genotoxiska
egenskaper, eller ämnen som inte uppvisar genotoxicitet. Dessa ämnen testades med
två olika cellinjer, TK6 och HepG2-celler. TK6-celler är humana lymfocyter som
använts mycket i flödescytometri och HepG2 är humana leverceller som används
mycket inom HCA. Cellerna utsattes för ämnena under 4 och 24 timmar varefter de
färgades för att detektera möjliga förändringar i markörerna för genotoxicitet. I
studierna med flödescytometri användes ett kommersiellt tillgängligt och validerat kit,
MultiFlow®. För HCA testades och lades ett immunfärgningsprotokoll upp som
färgade markörerna med hjälp av antikroppar. Flödescytometri användes för att testa
båda celltyperna. Det visade sig att HepG2-cellerna inte lämpade sig väl för denna
metod och en jämförelse mellan de båda cellinjerna kunde därför inte göras. För att få
jämförbara resultat från HCA metoden tolkades markörerna i bilderna genom
bildanalys och jämfördes med de negativa kontrollerna. På basis av den respons som
kunde iakttas med referensämnena och publicerade resultat från den vetenskapliga
litteraturen föreslogs kriterier för genotoxicitet vid användning av HepG2-celler.
Genotoxiciska egenskaper kunde förutsägas korrekt för 14 av 16 referens-ämnen
genom flödescytometrisk analys med TK6-celler. Av de två ämnen som gav inkorrekt
resultat var den ena en falsk positiv och den andra falska negativa skulle ha krävt
metabolisk aktivitet för att ge ett positivt resultat. Med HCA metoden med HepG2celler kunde samtliga 16 ämnen förutsägas korrekt med de kriterier som föreslogs.
Dessa var dock upplagda på basis av resultaten av endast 16 ämnen. För att ytterligare
bekräfta resultaten borde ett betydligt större antal referensämnen testas.
En intressant aspekt som framkom var betydelsen av p53 som markör. I HepG2cellerna kunde genotoxiciteten för de analyserade ämnena förutsägas utan användning
av denna markör, vilket även kunde möjliggöra användning av andra markörer i stället.
Fördelen med en bildbaserad analysmetod är möjligheten att även analysera händelser
81

Emmi Kuokkanen
i cytoplasman. Exempelvis kan mitokondriella toxiner leda till falska positiva
genotoxiska resultat. Markörer som detekterar mitokondriernas tillstånd kunde därför
möjligen användas för att minska antalet falska resultat. Fördelar med en bildbaserad
analys är även mångfalden av det som kan avläsas med olika metoder i själva analysen.
Till exempel är analys av uppkomsten av mikrokärnor, d.v.s. små DNA fragment som
skapas vid skador på DNA, en mycket använd metod i genotoxiska studier. Dessa små
DNA element kunde möjligtvis även direkt detekteras i bildanalys utan tillsatts av
ytterligare markörer. Eftersom en stor del data kan analyseras utgående från
bildmaterialet kunde skillnader i genotoxitetsmarkörernas uttrycksprofiler även
indikera mekanismerna bakom de skador som uppstår. På basis av denna studie visade
en bildbaserad analys för genotoxicitet ha en stor potential. För att kunna bekräfta
detta krävs dock fortsatta studier och bekräftelse genom användning av ett större antal
referensämnen. Om metoden påvisar sig mer prediktiv kunde den även tillämpas med
maskinlärning för en större förståelse av biologin bakom skadorna.

APPENDIX A
Expression of genotoxicity markers yH2AX, pH3 and p53 in TK6 cells presented as folds to negative
controls. The markekrs for yH2AX and pH3 are presented together with the RNC in one graph, with
the scale for the markers on the y-axis on the left-hand side and the scale for RNC on the right-hand
side. The green lines represent pH3-folds, the yellow lines yH2AX-folds and the grey lines the RNC.
Likewise, the marker for p53 and the RNC are shown on the other seprate graph with the same logic
and p53-folds as red lines. The concnentration series is presented in µM as a logarithmic scale on the
x-axis. The two same-coloured lines represent the two different timepoints measured, after a 4-hour
incubation and a 24-hour incubation. The values presented are the median of all measured values for
the same compound at the same concentration. The error bars represent the median absolute deviation
(MAD). Results for each compound used in this study is shown on separate pages.
