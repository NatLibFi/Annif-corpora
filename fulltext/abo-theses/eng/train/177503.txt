Title: Evaluating User Experience (UX) of students using a Learning Management System
Moodle in a Finnish university through a holistic UX model approach
Supervisor: Shahrokh Nikou
Supervisor: Gunilla Widén
Abstract:
Literature suggests that e-learning has growing importance for higher education. Learning Management
System (LMS) is an integral part of the facilitation of the e-learning process. Hence, students’ User
Experience (UX) of LMS is essential in learning at higher education. However, existing research literature
into UX of LMS mostly relies on quantitative surveys based on reductionist technology acceptance
models. Contemporary research covers the research gap by employing a holistic UX model in a
qualitative-driven mixed methods approach. Semi-structured interviewing of 20 students at Åbo Akademi
University was conducted, where Moodle is used as an LMS. As a result, UX of Moodle may be
characterized as an efficient study-related tool, which lacks entertainment and communication facilitation.
Other web-platforms (such as e-mail, WhatsApp, or YouTube) were found to affect the UX of Moodle by
replacing, compensating or complimenting some features of Moodle. Data suggests that the context of use
and how teachers use Moodle are highly detrimental to the students’ UX. Four groups of students were
established, whose UX ranged from good to somewhat bad. Most of the students had UX that is between
somewhat good and acceptable. Solutions were proposed to the identified issues in the UX based on the
students’ feedback. Additionally, the research attempts to find whether gender differences exist in the UX
of Moodle. Data suggest that there are no significant differences. Still, there may be slim differences in
certain aspects, with women focusing slightly more on a holistic use of Moodle, including how it is used
by others and how it looks, whereas men were focusing slightly more on the ability of LMS to facilitate
the performance of tasks, such as learning. Additionally, women were more variant in evaluating UX than
men. Finally, an employed holistic UX model is evaluated for its applicability to explore UX of an LMS.
It was found that the holistic UX model allows for exploring a UX, but quite broadly. As such, a new
conceptual model of UX of an LMS was developed, which may potentially help to focus on analyzing
specific elements of an LMS’s UX. The results of the research are compared with findings from the
literature. Ideas for further research are also suggested.

1 Introduction
New educational technologies are being more widely used. Web-Based Learning
(WBL) teaching is based on a large variety of different teaching methods. Moodle, as
an LMS, can be used to facilitate learning (Sheshasaayee & Bee, 2017, p. 738). Elearning as a teaching-learning mechanism offers tremendous opportunities for
learning beyond boundaries: increased reach to thousands of learners, facilitation
of the student’s interaction with the teacher and the content, collaborative learning,
as well as facilitation of the teaching process planning. Moodle-based e-learning
programs enable teachers to use multiple teaching tools like question banks,
assignments, feedback, which certainly enriches students learning experience.
(Bansode & Kumbhar, 2012, p. 415).
Current research in the use and adoption of e-learning systems is found to be mainly
based on various Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) and usability testing,
primarily via quantitative measurement methodology. Holistic User Experience
(UX) model, developed as a series of EU-funded research by Pallot and contributing
authors (Pallot et al., 2014), was characterized by the researcher to be prominent in
explaining UX holistically, contrary to the reductionist approaches by TAMs.
Applying the model in a qualitative-driven study may shed additional light on the
topic of UX of an LMS and thus may be found as a potent tool in exploring the topic.
To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, the holistic UX model was not yet applied
in the context of LMSs. Hence, the contemporary study shall address this research
gap by analyzing UX of an LMS and evaluating the applicability of the holistic UX
model for analyzing UX of an LMS.
According to Khan (2004), in the e-learning process, which is iterative, learners’
feedback could be used at the evaluation stage for consequent improvement of the
process by the design team. Cavus & Zabadi (2014, p. 525) state that all LMSs
software development organizations work hard to improve their product, and
Moodle may not be the best LMS tomorrow, and as such specific algorithms may be
necessary for continual comparison of the LMSs. Krawczyk et al. (2017) state that
the identification and evaluation of the UX features addressed during the design of
the product or service is crucial for innovation. Nakamura et al. (2017a) state that
according to the performed systematic literature review, none of the research in
usability and UX of LMSs proposed solutions to the identified issues in usability and
UX of studied LMS. Hence, the contemporary research shall address this gap by
performing the study in a pragmatic stance, which shall include users’ feedback on
the UX of an LMS to propose potential solutions to identified issues in the UX and
usability of an LMS.
Aufderhaar et al. (2019, p. 66) claim that gender difference has no significant impact
on the typical UX factors of different website designs. However, Ong and Lai (2006,
p. 826-827) claim that in the e-learning, there are differences in the interaction with
the IS between genders. Besides, Alkhaldi and Al-Sa’di (2018, p. 13) state that men
could interpret the technical savviness of the web banner – for example, evaluating
the present visual and audio features. Thus, ibid. (2018, p. 13-14) state that gender
should be included as a factor when assessing the UX of the web design. Finally,
Simon (2000, p. 18) concludes that the perception and satisfaction of the website

8

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

may differ within cultural clusters and gender groups. The research does not offer a
robust view on whether gender should or should not be considered as a factor
affecting the UX of websites or e-learning. Hence, this is another research gap that
shall be addressed by contemporary research.
1.1.

Research Questions

According to the literature review, specific research gaps in the literature were
outlined. Following Research Questions (RQs) were created to address the gaps:
RQ1: What is the holistic UX of the students, who use Moodle of Åbo Akademi
University?
RQ2: Are there any gender differences among the students in the holistic UX of Moodle?
RQ3: Is the holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019) applicable for analyzing the
holistic UX of an LMS?
RQ1 is about analyzing deductively the UX of Moodle (LMS) in an exploratory
manner through mixed methods approach. RQ1 is to be answered with a pragmatic
research stance in mind (i.e., researching for the sake of improvement). RQ2 is based
on the results of RQ1. RQ2 is about researching in an exploratory manner the
potential for existence of gender differences in UX. RQ3 comes as an evaluation of
the applicability of the utilized research approach proposed by the literature to
evaluate UX when answering RQ1 and RQ2. Hence, RQ3 is following exploratory and
explanatory research goals in a partially inductive manner.

2 Literature Review
In this part literature review is provided regarding three main parts that are in the
focus of the research: e-learning, Learning Management System (LMS) – Moodle,
User Experience (UX), and usability. Literature review on the gender differences in
e-learning and LMSs is discussed in a separate part. In addition to the
operationalization of the concepts relevant to the research, the literature review
covers the theoretical framework, which shall be applied in the study.
2.1.

E-Learning

Sun et al. (2008) defined e-learning as the use of telecommunication technology to
deliver information for education and training, with e-learning emerging as the
paradigm of modern education. McMullin et al. (2007) state that the younger
generation could be more accepting of the use of technology for learning, as
compared to older generations. Contrary, Fleming et al. (2017) state that age is not
an essential factor for the satisfaction of and intention of using e-learning. Ibid.
(2017) state that good predictors of future use and overall satisfaction from using
e-learning are low perceived complexity of the e-learning system, authentic learning
(i.e., the knowledge of e-learning is perceived to have useful applications), and
technical support available for e-learning (i.e., ICT service that helps with technical
issues of e-learning). Sun et al. (2008) state that personal perceptions about elearning could influence attitudes and impact whether a user would intend to refer
to e-learning in the future. Uppal et al. (2018) state that service quality (i.e., the
supportiveness of the service overall, such as ICT helpdesk), information quality
(i.e., learning content, which is of high informativeness, interactivity and welldelivered), and system quality (i.e., interface of the website, which is attractive and
easy to use and navigate) are different aspects of e-learning quality. There are
certain advantages and disadvantages (Table 1) to both the traditional classroom
learning and e-learning, as stated by Zhang et al. (2004, p. 76).

Khan (2004) has defined e-learning as an iterative process (Figure 1 below). Ibid.
(2004) describes e-learning process stages in the following way:
•

•
•
•

•

•
•

Planning Stage - the planning team (which can be comprised of individuals
such as director, manager, instructional designer, etc.) should develop a
project plan by analyzing various aspects of the people, processes, and
products involved in the e-learning initiative.
Design Stage - the research and design (R&D) coordinator lead the e-learning
course design process, based on a comprehensive understanding of learners’
needs, institutional capabilities, and experience.
Production Stage – production team creates an online course from the course
storyboard created during the design stage.
Evaluation Stage – inherent and on-going evaluations are conducted to
improve the effectiveness of e-learning materials. With learners’ feedback,
the evaluation specialist communicates with the design and production
teams for revising the course accordingly.
Delivery and Maintenance (D&M) Stage – D&M team maintains the learning
management system (LMS) and databases, provides technical support to
students, instructors, and support staff, and manages LMS user accounts and
network security.
Instruction Stage - instructional and support services staff (e.g., course
instructor, technical and administrative staff) are the people involved in
delivering the instructional product.
Marketing Stage - with the emergence of the e-learning industry, the market
has become highly competitive. As such, institutions must provide marketing
for their e-learning products to become competitive and provide a good
return-on-investment in e-learning.

Traxler (2005) states that m-learning utilizes handheld devices (e.g., mobile
phones) to facilitate and enhance the learning process. Ibid. (2005) also says that
inevitable confusion between the terms of e-learning and m-learning may exist in
the literature. Laouris and Eteokleous (2005) bring up based on their research
(partly on the literature research) that there are potential differences between e-

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

and m-learning in terms of pedagogical approach, modes of communication
between actors and methods of evaluation. Nedungadi and Raman (2012, p. 659)
claim that most personalized learning systems are designed for either personal
computers (e-learning) or mobile devices (m-learning), and as such, may demand
some sort of integration between e-learning and m-learning. Simultaneously, in
another article, m-learning as a part of e-learning, whereas e-learning is a part of a
broader distance-learning (d-learning). D-learning has the main characteristic of
distance and time between students and teachers that has more than one hundred
years of experience and traditions (Georgiev et al., 2004). Traxler (2005)
summarizes in the research that certain areas of e-learning and m-learning may be
similar (such as the use of tablet PCs). In contrast, other characteristics are different
(such as the use of SMS in m-learning and the use of PC in the e-learning).
2.2.

Learning Management System (LMS) – Moodle

Isakowitz et al. (1998) define “Web-based information systems” as Information
Systems based on Web technology, requiring new approaches to design and
development compared to traditional computer software. There are several elearning systems types, one of which is a Learning Management System
(Sheshasaayee and Bee, 2017, p. 736). Learning Management System (LMS) is a
powerful software system enhancing learning (Brusilovsky, 2003). LMS provides an
automated mechanism to deliver course content and track learning progress
(Dalsgaard, 2006). There are two types of LMS: open-source and closed-source, with
open-source LMSs are generally free of charge and customizable based on the user
preferences at a low cost (Bansode & Kumbhar, 2012, p. 415). Furthermore, Moodlebased e-learning programs can be used to enable teachers to enrich students’
learning experiences (ibid, 2012, p. 415). Moodle is mentioned as the widely used
LMS in higher education (Machado and Tao, 2007; Teo et al., 2019). Moodle’s initial
prototypes were created by Martin Dougimas in 1999, with Moodle 1.0 being
released in August 2002 (Moodle, 2020). Figures 2 to 4 below show the screenshots
of the user interface (UI) of Moodle of Åbo Akademi University in its several parts:
login page, the main page of the Moodle and the course space of one of the courses
on Moodle.

Sheshasaayee and Bee (2017, p. 738) characterize Moodle in the following way:
“Moodle helps to find optimal ways of learning and optimal learning results. Moodle
system plays a vital role in terms of measuring student's knowledge skills and
disciplinary practices. Moodle log files help the instructors to preprocess the data,
predict learning strategies, and summarize the website structure according to the
learner’s interest by applying mining techniques. Using the Moodle system makes the
learning processes easier and more interesting.”
On the official website, Moodle is described as having a highly customizable
software core with a list of features (Moodle, 2019). General Features of Moodle
include (Moodle,2019):
•

Al-Ajlan (2012, p. 193) in Figure 5 below represent a typology summary of generic
features of LMS. Moodle lacks two features (Company Profile and Bookmarks),
which is the least missing features number among 10 other LMSs in a study by AlAjlan (2012).

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Lamichhane et al. (2019) state that the Minimum Viable Product (i.e., a minimum set
of features that are required for the proper functioning of the IS) of an LMS are:
•
•
•
•

A user interface (UI), user authentication, and dashboard
Discussion forum for teachers and students with the feature of messaging
and video sharing
Content attachment feature for slides, pdf and video tutorials
Navigation and search bar

Evaluating on the five parameters of LMS, Cavus & Zabadi (2014) stated the
following regarding Moodle’s features:
•
•

•

•
•

Whiteboard/Video Services - Moodle has the best whiteboard feature
amongst the six LMS.
Discussion Forum - Moodle has a very active discussion forum. There are four
basic forum types in the Moodle community that help both students and
teachers exchange ideas through posting comments and organizing
workshops.
File exchange/Internal Mail – is excellent in providing easy ways for teachers
to present materials to their students. Files are uploaded and accessed via
Moodle. The only thing that is required from students is to have the right
software to open the files.
Online Journal Mail - Moodle has a journal module available, providing a text
area where students type in, which can also be revisited and updated.
Real-Time Chat - is available to enable participants to have a real-time
synchronous discussion in a Moodle course.

Adaptive learning and assessment system (ALAS) is a research-based solution to
provide individualized education and training to school students. ALAS has major
modules, represented in Figure 6 below. As such, ALAS helps to adapt the content to
the learner (based on the technical characteristics of the user’s device, initial
knowledge evaluation, user preferences and the progress of the learner), to author
the educational content for the teachers, and to store and retrieve content,
information about the learner and the log data. ALAS could also help to integrate elearning and m-learning because it can be utilized across different devices.
(Nedungadi and Raman, 2012). ALAS could be used as an example of the model
visualizing an LMS that provides individualized learning to understand the
interrelation of the elements of an LMS.

Students prefer Moodle because the interface is clean, the content is all place in the
same page, and it is most comfortable to follow among the three tested LMSs (ILIAS
and Atutor) as reported by the respondents in one research (Hock et al., 2015, p. 3).
As Cavus & Zabadi (2014) puts it, Moodle (together with ATutor) has the best
communication tools with a user-friendly interface among the six tested opensource LMSs.
2.3.

User Experience (UX) and usability

According to the U.S. Code § 8541. Definitions, “The term “end-user,” concerning a
good, service, or technology, means the person that receives and ultimately uses the
good, service, or technology.” Kujala and Kauppinen (2004) state users are
individuals who will be interacting with the system while customers are persons
who pay for the system. In the contemporary study, (end-)user is defined as an
individual who is using an LMS in the process of e-learning. For the most part, it is
an enrolled student at Åbo Akademi University using Moodle as part of his/her
studies at the university. There are, however, other potential (end-)users of LMSs,
which are not in the main focus in contemporary research – teachers and
administrators.
According to Pallot and Pawar (2012), Alben (1996) was the first to introduce UX in
the context of interactive products: “UX covers all the aspects of how people use an

17

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

interactive product – the way it feels in their hands, how well they understand how it
works, how they feel about it while they are using it, how well it serves their purposes,
how well it fits into the context in which they are using it, and how well it contributes
to the quality of their lives.” Norman (1999) describes UX as a concept, which
includes all facets of the user’s interactions with a product: how the product is
perceived, learned, and used. ISO FDIS 9241-210 defines the UX as “a person's
perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product,
system, or service. UX is a combination of all users' emotions, beliefs, preferences,
perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments
that occur before, during and after the use of product, system or service.” By UX, it is
meant how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world. UX is about
how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it,
looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it. One cannot design UX or sensual
experience; one can only design for a UX or sensual experience by creating design
features that evoke it (Sharp et al., 2007, p. 15). The concept of UX includes the range
of human responses that would be measured to include pleasure and the
circumstances in which they would be measured to include anticipated use and
reflection on use (Bevan, 2009).
Law et al. (2014) state that due to UX subsuming “a range of fuzzy experiential
qualities (EQs) such as happiness, disgust, surprise, and love,” there are inevitable
issues with claiming and discussing accurate measurability of UX. According to Law
et al. (2009), when the User Experience is mentioned, caution must be taken. UX is
seen as something desirable, though what exactly something means remains open
and debatable. There are three reasons why it is hard to get a universal definition of
UX, who is basing this statement on other authors (ibid., 2009). The first reason is
that UX is associated with a broad range of fuzzy and dynamic concepts, including
emotional, affective, experiential, hedonic, and aesthetic variables (Hassenzahl &
Tractinsky, 2006). The second reason is that the unit of analysis for UX is too
malleable, ranging from a single aspect of an individual end-user’s interaction with
a standalone application to all aspects of multiple end-users’ interactions with the
company and its merging of services from various disciplines (Sward, 2006). The
third reason is that the landscape of UX research is fragmented and complicated by
diverse theoretical models with different foci such as pragmatism, emotion, affect,
experience, value, pleasure, beauty, hedonic quality, etc (Cockton, 2008).
Furthermore, Law et al. (2014) state that there are two opposing views (i.e.,
quantitative and qualitative) of how UX should be studied – an argument rooted in
the classical philosophical debate on reductionism versus holism. Fenko et al. (2010,
p. 34) state that UX changes over time (from the moment of purchase up to one year
of usage). Norman (2009) also claims that the memory of the product usage is
influential in forming the evaluation of the UX of the product. Ibid. (2009) also
outlined that many users could not remember all the details of their experiences
when asked to evaluate these experiences after using the product.
Usability is generally regarded as ensuring that interactive products are easy to
learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user’s perspective. Usability has
several goals: effective to use (effectiveness), efficient to use (efficiency), safe to use
(safety), having good utility (utility), easy to learn (learnability), easy to remember

18

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

how to use (memorability) (Sharp et al., 2007, p. 20). Bevan (2009) state that
usability could be considered as a part of UX, or as a separate concept measuring the
use of the product objectively, whereas then UX is entirely subjective. Ibid. (2009)
state that there are two distinct objectives, regardless of terminology: optimizing
human performance and optimizing user satisfaction with achieving both pragmatic
and hedonic goals.
In general, there is no fundamental difference between measures of usability and
UX. However, the difference in emphasis between task performance and pleasure
leads to different concerns during user-centered design development. There are two
typical UX concerns during development. First is understanding and designing the
user’s experience with a product: how people interact with a product over time,
what they do, and why. Second is maximizing the achievement of the hedonic goals
of stimulation, identification, and evocation and associated emotional responses.
There are four typical usability concerns during development. The first is designing
for and evaluating overall effectiveness and efficiency. The second is designing for
and assessing user comfort and satisfaction. The third is designing to make the
product easy to use and evaluate the product to identify and fix usability problems.
The fourth is when relevant, the temporal aspect leads to a concern for learnability
(Bevan, 2009).
Additionally, Pallot et al. (2014) refer to the efficiency and effectiveness as parts of
a holistic UX model, together with hedonic and sensual attributes affecting the UX.
For the purposes of this research, usability and UX are to be considered closely
interrelated concepts, with UX being more comprehensive and which includes
usability. Usability is to be considered to be more concerned with the efficiency of
use, whereas UX is more concerned with the good experience of use overall.
Contemporary research will focus on the UX, of which some parts such as efficiency
could be considered both as properties of UX and as parts of the usability.
In short, from the literature it may be concluded that UX is a multi-factor complex
phenomenon, primarily subjective and based on the person’s perceptions with
difficulties in outlining the borders of components of the phenomenon, which are
fuzzy, changing over time, and with different (sometimes contradicting) approaches
to studying the UX. This must be kept in mind when designing research, collecting
the data, analyzing it, and interpreting the results of the analysis. However, gladfully,
the literature suggests specific laid-out models that study with some degree of
accuracy the complex phenomenon of UX. Taherdoost (2018) presents an overview
of the most popular models representing adoption/acceptance of technology by
users in the literature (Figure 7 below).
Figure 7. Adoption Models

19

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Source: Taherdoost (2018)
Topolewski et al. (2019) state that most of the identified aspects of
adoption/acceptance of technology by users are subjective, such as perceived
usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and whether the technology meets the user's
expectations. Terzis and Economides (2011) present a tabulated form of the major
constructs of the models, as well as literature that supports evidence of the existence
of these constructs (Figure 8).

Source: Terzis and Economides (2011).
Terzis and Economides (2011) present a table (Figure 9) with previous studies that
have used earlier constructs from the basic models in their proposed models
regarding LMS acceptance. As can be seen, related causal links consist of a simplistic
relationship between a few elements that constitute the intention to use an LMS. As
it was previously discussed, UX is a complex and multi-factor concept, which may
demand a more holistic approach.

UX could be evaluated based on 11 UX facets across 4 UX dimensions, as shown in
the holistic UX model (Figure 10), which has been reviewed in a series of research,
originating from EU-funded project in 2009 (Pallot & Pawar, 2012, Pallot et al.,
2014).
Figure 10. Holistic UX model

Source: Pallot et al. (2014)
Topolewski et al. (2019) cite and validify the UX model (Figure 11 below), which is
applied in the context of using a mobile app. Ibid. (2019) bring up that the TAM3
model could be upgraded with UX dimensions, facets, and properties, where the
intention-to-use and its three factors are affected by the UX dimensions. Ibid. (2019)
describe 21 UX properties in Figure 12. UX model is verified quantitatively for all of
the hypotheses, with the exception for the hypothesis that Interpersonal facet is
affecting Social Dimension (H6). Results showed that Business, Human and Social
dimensions impact users’ potential intention to use (Topolewski et al., 2019).
21

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Business dimension denominates the Viability of the product; Social dimension
denominates Connectivity & Adoptability; Human dimension denominates
Sensitivity & Receptivity (Pallot et al., 2014). Titling of the facets and dimensions
may be argued, since, for example, “Business dimension” in of itself might not be
applicable to the software provided by the university. Still, for the lack of better
wording, these titles are accepted due to the fuzzy nature of UX elements that are
hard to define.

Simultaneously, another mixed methods research by Krawczyk et al. (2019) utilized
the same dataset as in the research by Topolewski et al. (2019), and in the data many
qualitative responses were contradicting quantitative responses. It is speculated
that mixed methods allowed to partially eliminate the bias of the respondents of not
understanding the question correctly, giving too little thought into it, or over-underevaluating the answers (Krawczyk et al., 2019). Hence, it is believed that in order to
tackle the problem of receiving proper evaluations of UX, the methodology should
be properly adjusted, such as having mixed methods to improve the validity and
reliability of the results.
Krishnamurthy et al. (2010, p. 149) state that during the software development of
e/m-learning systems, usability and user acceptance are considered highly
important because people with varied skillsets use these systems (e.g., Admin,
Students, and Teachers). Simultaneously, Ardito et al. (2014, p. 1) state that in too
many software development companies, usability and UX are either neglected or not
properly considered. Ibid. (2014, p. 21) state that to resolve this situation, public
organizations must explicitly mention usability and UX requirements in the Calls for
Tenders for ICT products. Additionally, Nakamura et al. (2017a) state that none of
the existing research in usability and UX of LMSs proposed solutions to the identified
issues in usability and UX of studied LMS.
Certain conclusions may be made from this section of the literature review. Firstly,
UX of an LMS was not explored through the holistic UX model, but rather through
TAMs, which focus on narrower parts of UX, hence fostering a reductionist point of
23

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

view, which may fail to explain certain parts of UX as compared to the holistic view.
Furthermore, UX of an LMS was not studied in a pragmatical context, with the goal
of providing potential solutions to the identified issues. Secondly, the research gap
lies in the lack of knowledge, whether UX of an LMS could be explored effectively
using the model. As a result, the research gap of applying the holistic UX model to
explore the UX of an LMS in the context of e-learning is found, which shall be
addressed by contemporary research.
2.4.

Gender Differences in e-learning and the use of LMSs

Previous research in the field of studying e-learning assumes two genders (Ong and
Lai, 2006; Kuo et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2009). Some recent research in other fields
may acknowledge some possibility of variability in terms of gender, for example, the
so-called “transgender umbrella term,” described by Davidson (2007). However, the
academic practice in studying the gender differences in e-learning based on two
genders is yet to be disputed. As such, the contemporary study will also assume the
person’s gender to be a categorical value with two variables: male or female.
There is some research conducted in the past regarding the evaluation of gender
differences in e-learning and the use of LMSs. González-Gómez et al. (2012) state
that there are few differences between male and female students in their use of elearning and their motivation and satisfaction. Aufderhaar et al. (2019, p. 66) claim
that gender difference has no significant impact on the typical UX factors of different
website designs. Alkhaldi and Al-Sa’di (2018, p. 13) state that men could interpret
the technical savviness of the web banner – for example, evaluating the present
visual and audio features. Simon (2000, p. 18) concludes that the perception and
satisfaction of the website may differ within cultural clusters and gender groups.
Men’s rating of computer self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
and behavioral intention to use e-learning are all higher than women. Women were
more strongly influenced by perceptions of computer self-efficacy and ease of use,
and that men’s usage decisions were more significantly influenced by their
perception of the usefulness of e-learning. Thus, factors of gender must be
considered in the development and testing of e-learning theories (Ong and Lai,
2006).
A pilot study was conducted to understand whether students are satisfied with the
integration of an educational reward system called Trading Card Game with Moodle
and whether the integration may be used to engage students in learning. As long as
the system is useful, both male and female students would like to access the
information on the in-game card reward that they received in the Trading Card
Game from Moodle (Kuo et al., 2019). Finally, gender differences moderate the
effects of social influence and self-management of learning on m-learning use
intention. Social influence on usage intention is significant for men but insignificant
for women. The effect of self-management of learning on intention was moderated
by gender such that it was more significant for women than for men (Wang et al.,
2009). To conclude, the previous research bears contradicting findings. Given that
there’s no conclusive answer to whether there is any gender difference in the UX of
an LMS in the context of e-learning, the research gap shall be covered by
contemporary research.

3 Methodology
In the following section, Research Design, and methodology of the data collection
and data analysis are provided in high detail. At the end of this section, a shorter
methodology summary is provided.
3.1.

Research Design

Saunders et al. (2009, p. 108) provide a research onion (Figure 13), which
demonstrates possible research approaches that affect the data collection and data
analysis of the research. The following decisions were made in this research starting
from the outside and going to the center of the research onion: pragmatism,
deduction, survey, mixed methods (qualitative-driven), cross-sectional, qualitative,
and quantitative data (due to mixed methods approach).
Figure 13. The research 'onion'

Source: Saunders et al. (2009, p. 108)
Pragmatics recognize that there are many ways of interpreting the world and
undertaking research. According to pragmatics' perspective, no single point of view
can ever give the entire picture and that there may be multiple realities. Values play
a significant role in interpreting the results in pragmatism, with the researcher
adopting both objective and subjective points of view. The focus in this philosophy
is on practical applied research, integrating different perspectives to help interpret
the data (Saunders et al. 2009, p. 109). In terms of analyzing UX, which is highly
subjective, the researcher would have to immerse oneself deeply into multiple
points of view, and as such pragmatism is chosen as a philosophy.
In a deductive approach, theory and hypotheses are developed for testing in which
a research strategy is designed (as opposed to an inductive approach, where a
theory is developed based on data). Additionally, it is an essential feature of a
deductive study to impose controls in order to test for the hypothesis, to
25

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

operationalize the terms, and to be able to somehow generalize to a larger
population (Saunders et al. 2009, p. 124-127). Simultaneously, Saunders et al.
(2009, p. 127) state that it is often advantageous to combine deductive and inductive
approaches within the same research. On the one hand, a deductive approach is
about using an existent verified theory, relying on quantitative data and being highly
scientific and, as such, supposedly highly reliable and valid. On the other hand,
inductive research, is more about gaining an understanding of the meanings of
humans attaching to events, relying on qualitative data, and a realization that the
researcher is part of the research process (Ibid., 2009, p. 127). In the context of
analyzing UX, it is crucial to recognize the value of following existent frameworks,
which are to help to measure the phenomenon validly and reliably. At the same time,
UX is highly subjective. When a qualitative approach is used as an exploratory tool,
it may deem indeed beneficial to have certain inductive elements to the research.
Human-centered design (HCD) advocates that a more promising and enduring
approach is to model users' natural behavior to begin with so that interfaces can be
designed that are more intuitive, easier to learn, and freer of performance errors
(Oviatt, 2006). Norman (2005) states that human-centered design (HCD) was
developed to overcome the poor design of software products. However, ibid. (2005)
also says that there are potential problems with HCD, related to too much centricity
on the user. Sanders & Stappers (2008) have provided a visual representation of the
domain landscape of human-centered design research, shown in Figure 14 below.
Figure 14. Domain Landscape of Human-Centered Design (HCD) Research

Source: Sanders and Stappers (2008)

26

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Sanders and Stappers (2008, p. 5) state that the user-centered design (UCD) is one
in which "trained researchers observe and/or interview largely passive users, whose
contribution is to perform instructed tasks and/or to give their opinions about product
concepts that were generated by others." Abras et al. (2004, p. 445) have
characterized 'User-centered design' (UCD) as "a broad term to describe design
processes in which end-users influence how a design takes shape. It is both a broad
philosophy and variety of methods. There is a spectrum of ways in which users are
involved in UCD, but the important concept is that users are involved in one way or
another." Norman and Draper (1986) are the authors who have initially coined the
term UCD. Sanders and Stappers (2008) characterize UCD as a part of the HCD
landscape. However, it is essential to mention that some researchers (Gasson, 2003)
might consider HCD as a contrary practice to UCD. As such, there might be some
conflicts in understanding definitions and defining the relationships between them.
For this research, Sanders and Stappers' (2008) understanding will be adopted.
A user-centered design (UCD) approach is contrary to the participatory approach,
whereby users are "given more influence and room for an initiative in roles where
they provide expertise and participate in the informing, ideating, and conceptualizing
activities in the early design phases." (Ibid., 2008, p. 5). Co-creation is a broad term,
referring to any act of collective creativity, i.e., a creativity that is shared by two or
more people, with applications ranging from the physical to the metaphysical. Codesign is collective creativity as it is applied across the whole span of a design
process, and co-design is a specific instance of co-creation (Sanders & Stappers,
2008). The contemporary research is to be primarily concerned with user-centered
design, whereby the users are more seen as the passive contributors of their
perspective. However, there are some aspects of co-creation represented in the
potential acquisition of the user-generated ideas regarding the possible
improvements of the existing product.
Abras et al. (2004, p. 446) state that users are a central part of the product
development process. Ibid. (2004) continue that the designer's role in the UCD is
about facilitating the use of the product as intended with the minimum effort of
learning how to use it. Sanders (2002) has claimed that the social scientist or
researcher serves as the interface between the user and the designer in the usercentered design process. As put by ibid. (2002), the researcher collects primary data
or uses secondary data to learn about the needs of the user, with the consequent
interpretation of the information, which is then proceeded to the designer of the
product.
Robinson et al. (2005) have proposed six stages in the UCD process, with user
participation or input at every stage. The visual model of the UCD process is shown
in Figure 15 below. The six stages that were proposed by the authors are:
1 Work domain analysis – initial communication of ideas and requirements
between the client and developer.
2 Conceptual development – outlining desired features that come from
understanding the work domain.
3 Prototyping – working models of the application are created, potentially
concurrent with interaction/usability studies, the following stage.

27

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

4 Interaction/usability studies are concerned with understanding the pieces of
an application that work well, as well as those that need further re-design.
Audio, video, as well as interviews and focus groups, may be included that
discuss the application.
5 Implementation is the creation of the actual product, with the potential
appearance of new problems in the process.
6 The final stage is debugging, whereby the application is adjusted to enhance
stability and compatibility and to make the most out of the computing
infrastructure in which it has been implemented.
Figure 15. UCD's six-stage process

Source: Robinson et al. (2005).
According to the model by Robinson et al. (2005), the contemporary research should
be considered to be at the stage of interaction and usability studies, where the
researcher is capturing the data on the use of an LMS with the purpose of
consequent analysis and potential improvement of the LMS. For the purposes of
contemporary study, debugging is considered to be a part of the stage of interaction
and usability studies in the model of Robinson et al. (2005). The choice for such
modification is that in principle, in the model by ibid. (2005), after the stage of
debugging, there is no potential iterative cycles. This contradicts other researchers,
such as Detweiler (2007), who considers UCD to be an iterative process of three
phases:
1. Understanding users – observing and interviewing end-users and other
stakeholders to gather requirements.
2. Defining interaction – creating use cases based on the output from phase one.
3. UI design – prototypes are iteratively created and evaluated.
As it was previously mentioned, there are several stages to e-learning (Khan, 2004).
The contemporary study may be fitted in the "Evaluation" stage of e-learning that
attempts to collect learners' feedback about UX of an LMS in order to propose
solutions to the identified issues for the use at later stages of e-learning (design,
planning, or production). In the UCD, the contemporary study is at the stage of

28

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

understanding users in the interaction and usability studies, which then may be
used by designers to improve the UX of an LMS.
Preece et al. (2002) suggest techniques of involving users in the design and
development of a product, which may be suitable at different stages of UCD, shown
in Table 2. If the UCD is considered as a reiterative process, it may be considered
that the contemporary research is either at the beginning of the design project
(beginning of one of the iterative cycles of product improvement) or at the final
stage of the design cycle (when the product is already finished). In both ways,
interviews and questionnaires are suggested, albeit with different purposes in mind.
If the research is considered as the beginning of the design project, the purpose is to
collect the data related to the needs and expectations of users, evaluation of design
alternatives, prototypes, and the final artifact. If the research is considered at the
final stage of the design cycle, then the purpose is to collect qualitative data related
to user satisfaction with the artifact.
Table 2. Techniques for involving users in the design and development of a product

Nakamura et al. (2017a) state that for usability and UX evaluation of LMSs
questionnaires and interviews are widely used research techniques. Interviews are
verbal interchanges where the interviewer seeks to retrieve information from
another person (interviewee or respondent). There are three types of interviews:
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Structured follow a predetermined
and standardized set of questions; the questions are asked almost in the same
manner. Unstructured interviews are at the other end of the continuum: the
conversations in these types of discussions are being directed by the informant,
rather than by the set of questions. Semi-structured interviews are in the middle of
this continuum (Dunn 2005, 79-80.). The most common type of interviews used in
qualitative research are semi-structured interviews (Holloway and Wheeler 2010)
and involve the use of predetermined questions, where the researcher is free to seek
29

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

clarification (Doody & Noonan, 2013). Longhurst (2003, p. 103) states that the
interviewer prepares a list of predetermined questions, but semi-structured
interviews unfold in a conversational manner offering participants the chance to
explore issues they feel are essential. Gray (2004) states that the researcher can
explore new paths that emerge during an interview that may not have been
considered initially. Doody and Noonan (2013) summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of interviews in a tabulated form (Table 3). These are mentioned to
make the reader acknowledged of interviews’ applicability as a research tool.
Table 3. Advantages and disadvantages of interviews
Advantages

Disadvantages

• They are useful to gain insight and context.

• They may seem intrusive to the participant.

• They help participants describe what is important to them.

• They are time-consuming, not only in terms of conducting
them but also in relation to arranging them, travelling to the
venue, post-interview transcription and analysis of the data.

• They are useful in generating quotes and stories.

• They can be expensive compared with other methods.

• They enable the researcher to develop a rapport.

• Interviews on a personal and/or intimate subject can evoke
strong feelings and these feelings need to be handled with
great sensitivity.

• They give the researcher the opportunity to observe as well
• They are susceptible to bias, which may include:
as listen.
• They enable more complex questions to be asked.

- The participant's desire to please the researcher.

•The researcher can explain the purpose of the research and
answer any questions the participant may have about the
study.
• The researcher can probe the participant's responses and
seek further clarification.

- Saying what they think/feel the researcher wishes to hear,
such as giving an official point of view rather than their
personal view.
- The desire to create a good impression may lead to
participants not answering honestly.
- There is a tendency to say something rather than nothing if
the participant cannot answer a question or has nothing to
say on a topic.
- The researcher's views can influence the participant's
responses by expressing surprise or disapproval.

• Participants can seek clarification of a question.
• They help the participant to give detailed responses.
• Can explore participants' reasons for acting in a certain way
or their interpretations of events.
• They are more appropriate for certain groups, such as those
with reading or writing difficulties.
• Interviews can be a rewarding for participants as they
stimulate selfexploration and discovery.
• Personal benefit: the telling of one's story.

Interviews are often used in empirical software engineering research. The purpose
of using interviews in empirical studies is often to collect data about phenomena
that cannot be obtained using quantitative measures. Interviewing people provides
insight into their world, their opinions, thoughts, and feelings (Hove & Anda, 2005).
Sanders (2002) has stated that there are many ways researchers can learn from
people about their memories, their current experiences, and their ideal experiences,
with each route to experience revealing a different story or picture. Additionally,
ibid. (2002) state there are different levels of need, starting with explicit (what
people say) and observable (what people do) needs, continuing to tacit (how people
feel), and latent needs (i.e., those needs which are not recognizable until the future).
Sanders (2002) underlines that at a moment when all three perspectives are
researched simultaneously, a researcher can get closer to understanding and

30

establishing empathy with the individuals who use information systems. Figure 16
below shows the combined figures from the article by Sanders (2002) as to what
people say, do and make, and the levels of need. Conceptualization of the depth of
people's needs and behaviors may be useful to bear in mind when interpreting the
results of the interviews, which are asking people to say (other than anything else)
how they interact with the LMS, what they think about it and how they feel about it.

Nakamura et al. (2017b) stated that participants in a study of UX of LMS by the use
of generically used UX evaluation techniques UEQ (User Experience Questionnaire
(Laugwitz et al., 2008)) and IEAM (Integrated Experience Acceptance Model (Van
Schaik & Ling, 2011)) reported that the techniques do not provide a field to better
express their experiences, focus too broad without specifying which of the features
are being evaluated. As such, Nakamura et al. (2017b, p. 1015) determine that to
evaluate the UX properly, there's a need for techniques that provide a field where
participants can provide a detailed overview of their experiences, observations or
difficulties and to provide questions/adjectives specific to the features of LMSs for
a better evaluation of the use of LMS in the context.
As it was stated, ISO FDIS 9241-210 defines the UX as "a person's perceptions and
responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service."
Thus, interviews may be useful in gaining insights into the opinions, thoughts and
feelings, which constitute a UX. Sharp et al. (2007, p. 15) state that UX researchers
may carry out ethnographic field studies to research into users' needs and convert
them into actionable results. Chi Sig (2009) cited in Bevan (2009) state that data for
evaluation of UX could serve user opinion, user interview and user questionnaire.
According to Saunders et al. (2008, p. 323), Healey and Rawlinson (1994) cited: "one
section of an interview may ask a common set of factual questions [in a questionnaireor survey-like manner] … while in another section a semi-structured qualitative
approach may be used to explore [responses]".
Groves et al. (2011, p. 2) state that a survey is a systematic method for gathering
information from (a sample of) entities for the purposes of constructing quantitative
descriptors of the attributes of the larger population of which the entities are

31

members. Ibid. (2011, p. 34) claim that survey methodology is about balancing the
investments in each of the components of a survey to maximize the value of the data
that will result (in terms of its richness and accuracy).
A qualitative survey is the study of the diversity of member characteristics within a
population, in contrast to the statistical survey, which analyzes frequencies in
member characteristics. The variety of member characteristics may either be
predefined or developed in open coding. The qualitative survey should be
considered as a research design, which is different from other qualitative research,
such as those proposed by Creswell (1998): biography, phenomenology, grounded
theory, ethnography, and case study.
There are three levels of the qualitative survey: uni-dimensional description, multidimensional description, and explanatory analysis, developed in either in a conceptoriented or in a unit-oriented fashion. Furthermore, qualitative studies are either
inductive or deductive. In the former, relevant objects/topics, dimensions (aspects
of objects, variables) and categories (values at dimensions) are identified through
interpretation of raw data (e.g. interview transcripts). In the latter, certain
dimensions or categories are identified prior to the research. As such, the diversity
is outlined in advance, and the purpose of such a study is to see which of the
predefined characteristics exist empirically in the population under study (Jansen,
2010).
Cross-sectional studies are carried out at a one-time point or over a short period.
Cross-sectional studies are advantageous because they are relatively inexpensive,
take little time to conduct, and can estimate the prevalence of outcome of interest,
with many results and risk factors that can be assessed. Such studies provide only a
snapshot, and the situation may change over time. It is also hard to make a causal
inference. (Levin, 2006, p. 24-25). Cross-sectional studies are primarily used to
determine prevalence. Prevalence equals the number of cases in a population at a
given point in time. Cross-sectional studies are also used to infer causation. Many
cross-sectional studies are done using questionnaires. Alternatively, the researcher
may interview each of the subjects (Mann, 2003, p. 54-56). This research has limited
resources available, thus a cross-sectional study proving to be a satisfactory option.
Possible limitations of cross-sectional studies would be taken into account.
Creswell et al. (2003) state that there are different forms of concurrent strategies
that converge quantitative and qualitative data for providing a comprehensive
analysis of a research issue. Krawczyk et al. (2017) state that in these strategies,
both forms of data are simultaneously collected and then integrated for the
interpretation of the overall results. Ibid. (2017) continues that in the UX domain,
the mixed methods paradigm is an emerging research approach that allows
researchers to combine quantitative and qualitative methods into different forms of
research strategies. UX research could utilize at first a bipolar UX survey for
collecting quantitative rating data representing the level of user satisfaction
explained by several UX properties/factors, and then to carry out an interview with
a few individuals by collecting qualitative data bringing detailed justifications of
their ratings. Such an approach could enable a comprehensive evaluation of UX,
which is potentially scientifically rigorous and reliable (Krawczyk et al., 2017). A

32

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

study at the early stage proposed a typology of Mixed Methods in the UX, according
to which it is possible to evaluate how the quantitative survey response of a user
relates to the qualitative comment given at the same time, and whether user's
responses should be considered as valid or reliable in the research altogether.
Research found that users could potentially give quantitative answers that are not
in line with the qualitative statements, and as such, affect the data findings
(Krawczyk et al., 2019). The data collected from respondents, which was used to
validify the UX model (Topolewski et al., 2019), showed some inconsistencies in the
data by comparing quantitative data with the qualitative responses (Krawczyk et al.,
2019). UX model (Topolewski et al., 2019) was used in the survey design to form a
questionnaire.
Furthermore, quantification of the data may be beneficial for research that is dealing
with qualitative data. For example, when the researcher wants to count the
frequency of an appearing phenomenon. Frequencies may be displayed using a table
summarizing the number of cases or diagrams. Quantified data may be viewed as
supplementary to the qualitative data (Saunders et al. 2009, p. 497). Thus, this study
would utilize mixed methods (utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches)
with some quantification of qualitative data as a means of providing more
comprehensive findings and improving the validity and reliability of the research.
3.2.

Data Collection

Groves et al. (2011, p. 33) state, in the form of a list of questions, that in the survey
design, there are certain important decisions that a survey methodologist has to
make regarding thousands of individual features of a survey. These questions by
ibid. (2011, p. 33) are used as a basis for designing a survey for this study:
1 "How will the potential sample members be identified and selected?
2 What approach will be taken to contact those sampled, and how much effort
will be devoted to trying to collect data from those who are hard to reach or
reluctant to respond?
3 How much effort will be devoted to evaluating and testing questions that are
asked?
4 What mode will be used to pose questions and collect answers from
respondents?
5 If interviewers are involved, how much effort will be devoted to training and
supervising interviewers?
6 How much effort will be devoted to checking the data files for accuracy and
internal consistency?
7 What approaches will be used to adjust the survey estimates to correct for
errors that can be identified?"
Convenience sampling – is a method to choose participants who are available and
easy to find. The sample selection process is continued until a required sample size
has been reached. Convenience sampling is potentially less inclined towards bias if
the variation in the population is little (Saunders et al., 2009, p. 241). In
contemporary research, the main advantage of this technique is that it is easy and is
detrimental since a researcher is a single person, and the method of surveying

33

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

(qualitative) is a highly time-consuming occupation. Variation in the population of
students may not be that high, although certain characteristics may influence the
results, which are to be collected and presented for evaluating the reliability of the
sample. Furthermore, convenience samples often serve as pilots to more structured
studies (ibid., 2009, p. 241). This is an exploratory study, and future research may
try to establish a better sampling technique based on the acquired results. AlGahtani et al. (2016), in the study of e-learning acceptance and assimilation,
consider the convenience sampling technique as appropriate for researching the
topic. Hwang and Salvendy (2010) state that for usability evaluation of software
products, there should be 8 to 12 respondents at the minimum. As such, convenience
sampling will be how potential sample members are identified and selected. In this
research, 20 respondents will be surveyed, with 10 males and 10 females, so that it
is possible to compare the answers between the two groups qualitatively.
As it was mentioned above, this is research that utilizes qualitative interviewing as
its methodology. Participants are approached by the interviewer in person. Those
who are reluctant to give answers would have to be ignored as the only possible
option, although a data of total approaches to potential interviewees should be
recorded so that it is possible to estimate a non-response bias by comparing it with
the total number of interviews. According to Saunders et al. (2009), the subject of
research ethics has the necessary implications for the negotiation of access to people
and organizations and the collection of data. Authors state that the general ethical
issue is that the research design should not subject those who are being researched
to embarrassment, harm, or any other material disadvantage (Saunders et al., 2009,
p. 160). In the beginning, survey participants were given an ability not to respond
to any of the questions, as well as they were reassured that the responses would be
anonymized in the research, and as such, it will be impossible to track back the
results back to the respondent. This had several goals in mind. Firstly, it is an ethical
stance of the research to allow respondents to control the information that they give
and be reassured that the information will not harm respondents. Secondly, it could
potentially raise the level of confidence among the respondents that they are safe to
reveal the information and that they may feel comfortable during the survey. As a
result, information is expected to be more accurate and provide deeper insights.
Questions for the interviews are based on the literature. Certain factors in the
literature are considered to be influential in the use of e-learning. Maldonado et al.
(2011) state that potential factors affecting e-learning are gender, age, and
experience of use. Additionally, ibid. (2011) state, according to their literature
research that they consider culture, race, family income, religion, political activities
could impact the e-learning use. As such, ethnicity or nationality could broadly
represent the socio-economical background. Al-Gahtani et al. (2016), in the research
of e-learning acceptance, have included course major (e.g., Business or Engineering)
and study level (e.g., Bachelor's or Master's). Bowker (2015) states that language of
the website interface could potentially impact the UX, according to how translatable
the original text into another language, preferred by the user. Holtbrügge and Mohr
(2010) claim that exchange student status is related to the individuals' learning style
preferences. Thus, it is proposed that different patterns of e-learning, and
consequently – of Moodle UX – could emerge as a result of a difference in
characteristics of students. As such, these are deemed to be useful to gather from
34

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

participants – least to outline the potential differences and validity of collected
survey data.
Participants are given a survey where they are asked to reveal the information about
themselves, which may be considered as a contextual factor impacting the results of
the research. Respondents are asked to state their: Name or Respondent
number/ID, Age, Gender, Ethnicity or Nationality, Length of using Moodle (and if
used any other LMS), Language in which Moodle is mostly used (e.g., in English),
whether a student is an exchange or a home (i.e., from Åbo Akademi University)
student, and at what level of studies the student is currently studying (Bachelor's,
Master's or other).
Both the quantitative survey and semi-structured questions utilize the same
question format, and it's based on a holistic UX model by Pallot et al. (2014), which
was adapted by Topolewski et al. (2019) to evaluate UX properties of a mobile
feedback-collection app. Appendix 1 shows the survey questions and semistructured questions. UX properties for this study were adapted from research by
Topolewski et al. (2019), whereby 21 UX properties were tested on a dataset of 100
respondents answering 24 questions (together with 3 extra questions concerning
the intention to use, as being formulated by the UX properties, facets and
dimensions). Questions were also adapted based on a study by Krawczyk et al.
(2019), which relies on the same dataset and where questions about UX properties
are structured in an intelligible for a surveying manner (the questionnaire is
accessed by the researcher as a co-author in both of the studies). Questions for this
research were adapted because the UX properties were utilized in a different
context of using a mobile application. After retrieving information about
respondents, interviewees were given a survey to fill on a Likert scale from 1 to 7,
where 1 is very unfulfilling UX property, and 7 is very fulfilling UX property. After
respondents gave answers to the quantitative survey (Appendix 1) on a paper, the
researcher has taken the role of an interviewer and proceeded to ask semistructured questions that aimed at evaluating the same UX properties. In the process
of interviewing, the researcher occasionally asked questions asking to verify,
elaborate, or expand on the topic mentioned by the respondent to gain richer
qualitative data. The interviews were audio-recorded for the consequent
transcription. Transcription of the interviews is usually made after recording
interviews – reproduced as a written (word-processed) account using the actual
words (Saunders et al. 2009, p. 485).
The data was collected between 21.02.2020 and 10.03.2020 approximately between
10 AM and 6 PM on the premises of Åbo Akademi University in Turku, Finland.
Respondent surveying was comprehended in a public space in two out of several
university campuses: ASA or Arken. The area where the interviewing was taking
place was different environment – sometimes noisy with many people passing by,
occasionally silent with a few people nearby. Sometimes, other people were sitting
nearby the participants, supposedly of their close social circle like study
acquaintances, with a few times when these people commented on something but
were asked not to intervene for the sake of not influencing the opinion of any given
respondent, who was expected to give feedback on the individual UX. Oftentimes,
however, respondents were alone when giving interviews. Approached respondents

35

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

on the campus were frequently busy doing some other activity, with the most
reported reason for not giving an interview by those who rejected being survey that
they do not have the time or that they have to focus on studying. Some of the
respondents knew the interviewer before being approached with a request to
survey them or potentially saw the researcher on the public premises. As such, the
research context must be considered when evaluating the limitations because the
context might have influenced the data in one or the other way.
After the stage of interviewing respondents began the process of transcribing the
interviews from collected audio files to a word-processing tool MS Word. It was
done by listening to the audios with recorded interviews and then typing in the text
in MS Word under the codified names of the respondent's number and gender (F or
M). Transcripts of the interviews were later analyzed with the computer-assisted
qualitative analysis software tool (CAQDAS) called NVivo. Additionally, quantitative
data from the questionnaires were filled into MS Excel, whereby it was consequently
analyzed quantitatively.
Answering the fifth question of Groves et al. (2011, p. 33), the researcher, who is
simultaneously bearing an interviewer role, has designed the survey and is
relatively experienced with semi-structured interviews, and as such, shall be
considered trained and adequately supervised. Consequently, data was verified by
the interviewer by checking that the data is appropriately collected and recorded
(such as there were no missing ticks in the questionnaire or no double-marks, which
happened during the data collection stage a couple of times). In the process of
interviewing, there were also occasional moments when the researcher asked the
respondent to comment verbally on the supposed inconsistency in the quantitative
score in the survey and the given qualitative comment, with the goal of at least
outlining the potential limitations of the mixed methods. Finally, to evaluate the
methodology's suitability for exploring the UX of LMS, the researcher sometimes
asked to comment at the end of interviews whether it would have been easier for
the respondent to understand questions (and thus answer more to the point of the
question asked) if quantitative or qualitative data collection was before the other. A
number of people who rejected being surveyed was recorded to estimate the nonresponse bias.
After the data collection, quantitative and qualitative data are consequently
analyzed, where findings and results are drawn. The survey estimates would not be
adjusted to correct for errors that can be identified, given that it is a qualitativedriven survey. Although, as it was mentioned, additional data (other than gender,
which is at the core focus of this research) are collected from participants, which
would help to establish potential sources of errors. As a result, it is expected that the
contemporary qualitative-driven mixed methods approach to evaluating UX of LMS
Moodle will help to answer the RQs and help address the gaps in the research
literature.
3.3.

Data Analysis

According to Saunders et al. (2009, p. 503-505), Miles and Huberman (1994)
described three concurrent broad tasks for qualitative data analysis: data reduction,

36

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

data display, and conclusion drawing or verification. Data reduction is about
summarizing and simplifying the data collected and selectively focusing on some
parts of this data. The process of data reduction attempts to transform the data and
to condense it. Lengthy, unreduced text in the form of interview transcripts are
cumbersome because they are dispersed over many pages and are hard to
comprehend. For this purpose of showing qualitative data in a clear manner,
qualitative data display may be applied. Data display through visual formatting
shows the information in a systematic way. Thus, it is possible to draw conclusions
and take necessary actions to tackle the problem. There are two main families of
data display: matrices and networks. Matrices are generally tabular in form, with
defined columns and rows, where data are entered selectively into the appropriate
cells of a matrix. A network is a collection of nodes or points connected by links or
lines that display streams of participant actions, events, and processes. Networks
may help to express complex interrelationships between variables (Saunders et al.,
2009, p. 503-505.)
Jansen (2010) recognizes three levels of qualitative analysis: uni-dimensional
description, multi-dimensional description, and explanatory analysis, developed in
either in a concept-oriented or in a unit-oriented fashion. The first level of the
qualitative analysis is a unidimensional description. In the unidimensional
description, three logical levels of diversity have to be distinguished: objects,
dimensions of objects (variables in statistical analysis), and categories of
dimensions (values). The coding of a data fragment could be either downward (i.e.,
differentiating, establishing diversity within an object by distinguishing categories)
or upward (i.e., synthesizing, specifying commonalities with other objects,
dimensions, or categories). In the second-level analysis, multi-dimensional
description is performed. The analysis could be case-oriented or dimensionoriented. Concept-oriented synthesis consists of compiling (explicitly or implicitly)
a number of dimensions and/or categories into one abstract core concept, while
case-oriented synthesis consists of grouping similar cases into types (categorical
classes) (Jansen, 2010).
Third-level analysis in a qualitative survey is an explanation. In the statistical causal
analysis, the aim is to explain (technically, not theoretically) gradual variation
(variance) in the dependent variable (representing the object of study) based on
independent variables by techniques like discriminant analysis, multiple regression
analysis, and linear structural relations (LISREL) analysis. In a qualitative survey,
one may analyze relationships between types (from the multidimensional
description) and selected contextual conditions with a conditional matrix. In the
qualitative analysis, the boundaries of multidimensional description and
explanation overlap, and in the practice of searching for a maximal explanation,
there is often an explorative iteration of descriptive and explanatory analysis
(Jansen, 2010).
Saunders et al. (2009, p. 481) state that CAQDAS (Computer-Assisted Qualitative
Data Analysis Software) may help with undertaking routine qualitative data
management tasks manually, such as sorting data into categories and locating
subsets of these data according to specified criteria. Ibid. (2009, p. 514) also mention
that the use of CAQDAS offers several advantages – when used systematically, it can

37

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

aid continuity and increase both transparency and methodological rigor. In this
research, CAQDAS NVivo 12.6 Pro was used at the stages of qualitative data
reduction, data display, and when preparing conclusions of the research. CAQDAS
was also used for some quantification of the data. MS Excel was used as a tool to
prepare the data to be used in the CAQDAS by typing in the received responses in
the respective data fields (such as the gender filled by the respondent in the survey
was typed in the column gender in the MS Excel). Transcripts of the interviews were
also typed in the MS Excel by copy-pasting the answers to semi-structured questions
into the respective data fields in MS Excel. After such data preparation, the
researcher has imported the data in CAQDAS – this allowed to have a more nuanced
data analysis. For example, it allowed seeing how many respondents of a certain
gender have mentioned a certain UX property in a semi-structured interview and
what quantitative grading they gave for that UX property. However, Campbell et al.
(2013, 308) mentioned that when performing qualitative analysis research
requires, coding is not a substitute for deep and repeated immersion in the
transcript data. Hence, the researcher has continually returned to the transcript
data in the data analysis stage.
3.4.

Summary of Methodology

The contemporary research is pragmatic, which means that the researcher is
immersed in the context of the study and social reality, although the researcher
makes attempts at abstracting oneself to some extent. The research is deductive,
based on mixed methods, although some inductive analysis may take place to
improve the validity of the research. Semi-structured interviewing was suggested
by the literature to analyze the UX of an LMS. Additionally, quantitative surveying
was found to be able to improve the capability for interpreting the qualitative data
collected by the semi-structured interviews. Previous research of a holistic UX
model was used as a basis for the qualitative and quantitative questionnaires. From
the previous research, 21 UX properties and 3 attributes of intention to use of an
LMS through giving a score on a Likert scale from 1 to 7 for the 24 questions were
taken. The same questions were used both for quantitative surveying and semistructured interviewing. Data were collected from 20 respondents – students of Åbo
Akademi University – at two of the several campuses of the university. Each of the
respondents was surveyed in three stages. The first stage asked to answer questions
on the printed survey on the respondent's name, gender, age, ethnicity or
nationality, the experience of using Moodle and other LMSs, the language of the UI
of Moodle, whether informants were home or coming from abroad, study level and
study major. The second stage asked to fill in a quantitative survey on the other side
of the printed paper. The third stage included the respondents answering the
researcher's semi-structured questions in an interview. The researcher occasionally
explained the semi-structured questions or asked additional questions to elaborate
on the respondents' answers. The questionnaire for the first and second stages may
be found in Appendix 1. Interviews were audio-recorded and then transcribed.
Consequently, data were analyzed in NVivo, MS Excel, and R studio. NVivo facilitated
the analysis of the qualitative data and quantification of qualitative data. MS Excel
was used to analyze quantitative and quantified data. R studio was used to perform
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis.

4 Results
In this section, the results of the study are presented. Firstly, the demographics of
the respondents are described, which come from data collection. After that, the
analysis of the collected data is performed. Data analysis starts with quantitative
analysis – descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and hierarchical clustering
analysis. Consequently, the central part of the data analysis – qualitative analysis
and data quantification – is performed. Verification of the results attempts to
evaluate the validity and reliability of the results. Finally, data analysis results are
presented, which is a summary of the performed data analysis in the previous parts.

Respondents

In total, 20 respondents were interviewed, out of which 10 were male, and 10 were
female. There were 8 people who have rejected interviewing, usually by justifying
their response with the lack of time for an interview, hence the response rate is
71.14%. As mentioned above in the data collection, other than collecting the
responses of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, additional self-reported data
were collected from respondents about them. Table 4 shows the collected dataset of
the respondents’ self-reported attributes.

Study Major

The average age was 23.4, whereas the median age was 22, ranging between 20 and
31 years. One female respondent chose not to reveal her age. There were 17
respondents with a Finnish, 1 Russian, 1 Kazakh, and 1 Italian nationality. Those
who reported being Finns, also mentioned that they used Moodle in Swedish (with
the exception of one male Finn, who may have used in Swedish or in Finnish). A
Russian female stated she used Moodle in English or Finnish, whereas Kazakh and
Italian students stated they used Moodle in English. With the exception of an Italian
student, all the other 19 respondents were from Åbo Akademi University.
Eleven respondents were studying at a bachelor’s level. Nine students were
studying at a master’s level. There are 4 female master’s students, 6 female

bachelor’s students, 5 male master’s students, and 5 male bachelor’s students.
Academic majors of the respondents varied significantly: 1 student was studying Art
History, 3 students studied Business, 1 student studied chemical engineering, 2
students studied Economics, 1 student studied environment and marine biology, 2
students studied the Finnish language, 2 students studied Governance of
Digitalization, 1 student studied international law and human rights, 2 students
studied international marketing, 3 students studied philosophy, 2 students studied
psychology, 1 student studied social sciences.
Respondents also reported that they were somewhat experienced with the use of
the learning management system. The average use of Moodle was 3.5 years, with a
median usage of 4 years, ranging between three months and 7 years. Some students
also had experience using other similar to Moodle LMSs (such as Wilma in the high
school in Finland or LMS used in other universities during the study exchange):
average use of other LMSs was 1.35 years, with a median use of 6 months.
Importantly, not all of the students have used any other LMS – just 12 students used
other LMS, ranging in experience from 6 months to 6 years. In total, the average use
of combined LMSs was 4.83 years, whereas the median use of LMSs was 5 years.
Finally, recorded semi-structured interviewing had an average length of 25 minutes,
whereas the median interview length was 22.25 minutes. Interviews lasted between
14 and 53 minutes. In addition to this time, for each respondent, about 3 to 5
minutes were devoted to filling out a printed-out survey and communicating the
purpose of the research, as well as answering arising questions. Table 5 below
shows the collected data on the quantitative evaluations of UX properties on a Likert
scale from 1 to 7, which is analyzed in the following sections of the thesis.

Analysis of the Collected Data

Quantitative Analysis

Firstly, descriptive statistics of the quantitative data is analyzed across given UX
scores. Mann-Whitney U test is applied to test the difference in the median between

40

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

the two populations of gender. Finally, hierarchical clustering analysis is performed
to establish clusters of the respondents based on the UX property scores.
Descriptive Statistics and Mann-Whitney U test of populations

Descriptive statistics of quantitative responses are given in three tables (Tables 6, 7
and 8): one for two genders combined and then two tables for each of the genders.

According to the descriptive statistics, it may be said that there are certain attributes
that are considered as relatively good according to the means (scores over 5):
usefulness, pleasantness, productivity, reliability, efficiency, fulfilness,
meaningfulness, engagement, confidence, respectfulness, as well as highly reported
intentions to use. Some elements are close to being mildly good to acceptable
according to the means (scores between 4 and 5): user-friendliness, enjoyment,
comprehensiveness, communicativeness, collaborativeness, attentiveness,
responsiveness, helpfulness. At the same time, descriptive statistics show that there
are some mildly low-rated elements according to the means (scores less than 4):
entertaining, novelty, attractiveness. Standard deviation, a measure of how much
variability there are in quantitative scores, shows that standard deviation for most
of the UX properties and intention to use is between 0.75 and 1.8 – some elements
having higher variability (e.g., Novelty) than others (e.g., Productivity). There are

It may be seen that there are certain differences in how the two genders evaluate
the UX properties of Moodle quantitatively. The table in Table 9 shows the difference
by subtracting the mean, standard deviation, and median score of the male group
from the female group (i.e., if the number is positive, it means that the female’s
variable is higher than male’s). The Colour scheme is applied to represent UX
properties that are most deviant from each other. It is seen that some UX properties
are not different or little different across the two genders, based on means (scores
of +/- 0 to 0.2): usefulness, pleasantness, reliability, enjoyment, fulfilness,
comprehensiveness,
engagement,
communicativeness,
responsiveness,
convincingness and recommend. There are some UX properties that are mildly
different based on means (scores of +/- 0.3 to 0.5): entertaining, productivity,
efficiency, user-friendliness, meaningfulness, collaborativeness, confidence,
attentiveness. There are also a few UX properties, which are seemingly different for
the two genders based on means (scores of +/- 0.9 to 1.3): novelty, helpfulness,
respectfulness, willingness. Simultaneously, females tend to be more variant in how
they give their quantitative responses, according to having generally higher
standard deviation for the scores.
Milenovic (2011) states that the Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric statistical
technique used to compare the difference between medians of the two data sets of
values on an ordinal or continuous scale, which is used instead of t-test when the
normality of the sample distribution is not available. The null hypothesis in the
Mann-Whitney U test is that the medians of the two populations are equal. If the null
hypothesis is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis is that the medians of the two
populations are not equal. As such, at the level of confidence (i.e., alpha) is equal to
0.05 (5%), none of the medians for any of the UX property is significantly different
between the genders. If the level of confidence (i.e., alpha) is equal to 0.1 (10%), then
only the medians in Helpfulness and Respectfulness are different (i.e., females
ranking these higher than males). Applying the Mann-Whitney U test similarly to
test whether the medians of the standard deviations of the UX properties are equal
for males and females, one would get a very small p-value of 0.000017. Hence, the
44

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

medians of the standard deviations of mean scores of UX properties across two
genders differed, showing that women are more variable in how they evaluate UX
than men.
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

Zhang et al. (2008) state that cluster analysis is used for clustering a dataset into
groups of similar individuals. Additionally, cluster analysis is unsupervised learning
and among the major techniques in pattern recognition. Jain (2010) states that
clustering algorithms can be broadly classified into two groups: hierarchical and
partitional. Celebi et al. (2013) state that K-means is the most widely used
partitional clustering algorithm. Tu et al. (2012, p. 641) state that hierarchical
clustering analysis is a widely used clustering technique, which can be divided into
two categories: agglomerative methods, which proceed by making a series of
merges of the n objects into more general groups, and divisive methods, which
separate n objects successively into finer groups. Celebi et al. (2013) conclude that
there are different advantages and disadvantages to both methods, and as such –
different situations when hierarchical and partitional clustering analysis could be
used.
A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the collected data in the R
studio. Hierarchical clustering was preferred over the K means method due to the
exploratory approach when analyzing UX. In the hierarchical clustering, one does
not necessarily need to have an idea regarding the number of clusters, in this case,
represented by the general lack of understanding of how many groups of users there
are with similar UX properties. In a small sample study, the hierarchical approach
may facilitate visualization and verification of the data through dendrograms, which
is preferred over the K means approach.
Quantitative scores of UX properties across 24 attributes given by 20 respondents
were used to categorize respondents in the clusters. Additional data about
respondents was not utilized in the analysis (i.e., the data was filtered for the
respondent ID and quantitative score of UX properties and intention to use).
Hierarchical Clustering Methods with Complete, Single, Average, and Ward Linkage
were compared with each other to select the best method by comparing Height on
the y-axis, shown in Figure 17 below. The clustering method whereby the difference
between clusters was highest represented by the Height on the y-axis (i.e., the
vertical line between clusters of pairs is tall), while the difference inside the clusters
was minimal (i.e., the vertical line inside clusters of pairs is short) was chosen.
Complete or Ward linkage were both satisfying that condition. Agglomerative
hierarchical clustering with ward linkage was chosen.
Figure 17. Comparison of Hierarchical Clustering Linkage Methods.

Next, the optimal number of clusters (k) was chosen by applying the two methods
simultaneously: Total Within-clusters sum of squares (WSS) and Average
Silhouette. In the former, the rule states that such a k must be chosen, after which
there is a slight decrease in a marginal decrease in WSS score, in other words, finding
its “elbow” in the chart (Hansen et al., 1998). Average Silhouette rule for choosing k
states that such a k must be chosen, which has the highest Average Silhouette score
on the y-axis (Arsan and Hameez, 2019). Both methods could be used together to
select the most optimal k, by trying to select such a k, which compromisingly
satisfies both rules (Figure 18). As a result, the number of clusters 4 is chosen.
Figure 18. Comparison of WSS and Average Silhouette scores.

As a result, Hierarchical Clustering with Ward Linkage with four clusters is
performed on the dataset. Figure 19 below shows the resulting clustering analysis
in the form of the dendrogram, with a number at the base of the “tree” representing

46

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

the respondent number. Clusters suggested by the WSS and Average Silhouette
methods roughly correspond to the clusters shown in the dendrogram.
Figure 19. Hierarchical Clustering with Ward Linkage with four clusters outlined.

After the clustering, cluster numbers were assigned to each of the respondents in
the table. After the assignment of the cluster (k) to each of the respondent, averages
were calculated to see the average of the attributes of the respondents (age, gender,
study major, the experience of use, interview time) and the UX properties reported
by the respondents in the same cluster. Tables 10 and 11 below show the results of
calculating the averages, with a colour scheme applied to the UX properties for
better visualization.

There are 3 respondents in cluster 1, 7 respondents in cluster 2, 9 respondents in
cluster 3, and just one respondent in cluster 4. As one could observe, the four
resulting clusters differ from each other, with diminishing overall scores for all of
the UX properties. There are only 5 UX properties where clusters do not have a
gradually diminishing average UX property score: Novelty, Meaningfulness,

47

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Confidence, Convincingness, Willingness. However, even in these UX properties,
clusters tend to have only a minor difference or with a small change of order (e.g., in
Novelty – clusters 2, 3, and 4 are still having diminishing scores for that UX property,
while only cluster 1 is not following the logic). Masters are increasingly more placed
in the clusters that value Moodle more (k=1,2,3), than Bachelors, who are
proportionately more placed in the clusters that value UX less (k=2,3,4). Genderwise, clusters 1 and 4 are 100% female. Cluster 2 is mostly male (71%), while cluster
3 is approximately even in terms of gender.
Qualitative analysis and data quantification

Quantitative evaluations may give some general overview of how students and two
different genders view the UX of using Moodle. However, the picture given by
quantitative evaluations of the respondents is considered in the supportive role and
should be viewed together with qualitative analysis. In the following part, the data
analysis of semi-structured interviews is presented under 24 separate elements,
representing UX properties and the intention to use.
Due to the mixed methods utilized in this study, each of the themes mentioned by
the respondents when answering a semi-structured question was coded in the
CAQDAS, and the number of respondents mentioning each of the topic or theme was
quantified. The name of the mentioned topic is a shortened code of the topic that is
explained below in the text to each of the UX property. The total number of the
respondents, as well as the number of respondents for each gender for each topic, is
calculated separately (Num. of resp. in the tables). Distribution of the number of
people simultaneously ranking the UX property in the quantitative survey for each
of the mentioned topics is given for each of the genders. For example, in the 1 –
Usefulness, 3 females have rated Usefulness as 6, when stating that Usefulness
depends on the teacher, whereas 1 male has rated Usefulness as 5 and another as 6.
Total mean score, as well as for each of the gender, is calculated for each of the
mentioned topics separately, based on the previously mentioned distribution of
quantitative scores. Finally, the difference in the number of respondents and in
mean scores of the mentioned topic is calculated by subtracting the value for a male
group from the respective value for the female group. For example, in 1 – Usefulness,
one more female mentioned the topic that Usefulness comes from an overview of
the course, with 1.5 higher mean scores for females mentioning the same topic than
males. If the mean score difference cannot be calculated, then the field is left blank.
A colouring scheme is applied to the values in the tables so that they are easier to
read visually. Each of the tables is commented in the text below. The tables with
quantified data are provided so that the reader can get a broader picture of the
qualitative results. However, the reader might skip them as these are quite technical,
with the summaries below the tables being the core message. Numbers in the
brackets are sometimes used near the statements, and these represent the number
of references of that statement. For example, “Moodle helped to increase grades
because of being an easy place to access information (3),” means that three
respondents mentioned that.

Respondents tend to mention that Moodle is a useful or somewhat useful platform
for learning. 5 mentioned that the usefulness of the Moodle depends on the teacher.
5 respondents also stated that Moodle is useful because it provides an overview of
the course together with all relevant to the course information provided by the
teacher. 5 mentioned that Moodle helps with doing the tasks and assignments, such
as 3 respondents who mentioned that in Moodle, it is easy to send assignments and
tasks. 3 said that Moodle is useful because it is easy to use. 2 students outlined that
there are many e-learning courses, which are easy to access in Moodle. One student
stated that there are a few professors in her major, and hence Moodle is easy for
these teachers to provide teaching. One mentioned that Moodle helps to understand
the teacher. Simultaneously, other students state that Moodle is not particularly
useful. One student mentioned that Moodle could be slow, such as loading
documents in a browser window, which could be improved. Another stated that
group works are not thought through, and hence could be improved in Moodle by
implementing some sort of a feature for group work.

11 respondents expressed something concerning the easiness of navigating and
using Moodle. The majority of these responded that it is an easy platform in that
sense. Some stated that it is a hard platform to navigate and use, or that it is hard in
the beginning, but then it gets easier over the experience of use. 5 students
expressed that they consider Moodle as a pleasant platform, whereas two found it
neutral, and one stated that it is not a pleasant platform for the most part. Three
students stated that pleasantness depends on the teacher – how he or she structures
the course and the content. One respondent mentioned that Moodle is of limited use,
with just sending assignments, and another stated that Moodle is for work, and
hence does not have to be pleasant. Another student stated that the most pleasant
thing in Moodle is that she is used to using it. There were several suggestions for
improving Moodle in that regard – making Moodle simpler to use, making it easier
to find new courses, and making bookmarks at the top of the content so that it is
easier and faster to scroll to the required information in the content. Another
suggestion was that if there are hidden tasks in the Moodle page by the teacher, the
student would not be able to achieve a 100%, but a 99% course completion by
ticking the tasks as completed, which annoyed one student.

Respondents tend to characterize Moodle as not being entertaining. Simultaneously,
8 students stated that Moodle is a school app, and hence it does not have to be
entertaining. 8 respondents mentioned that course could be more entertaining if the
content or the teacher makes that course entertaining. 6 people mentioned
something about the colours of the course or the visual part of the website – most of
them tend to state that colours are neutral or bleak, consisting mostly of white, with
just one student saying that the colours are fun. Several respondents proposed to
make brighter colours, for example, such as the university’s official colours (red and
yellow). Another student stated that the design of the Moodle layout could be
improved. Other students proposed to introduce more visuality, such as more
images in the content. 3 students stated that interactivity is positively correlated
with how much they are entertained while using Moodle (such as having quizzes to
answer instead of only reading the plain text).

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Respondents, in general, tend to agree that Moodle allows them to be productive,
but they outline different perspectives when they speak of productivity. 11 students
stated that Moodle is either informative or provides means for easy finding the
information. One student even stated that she felt “dependent on Moodle” since it
helped her to find answers to the questions. In particular, 4 respondents underlined
that Moodle gives an overview of the course or tasks in Moodle. One student
characterized very high productivity of Moodle “in the sense that it [Moodle] helps to
monitor all tasks and assignments that I have to accomplish.” The same student also
mentioned the calendar as the main helpful in that sense feature that provides an
overview of deadlines. Another respondent stated that the calendar feature is
productive because it is integrated with the Google Calendar. Simultaneously, not all
of the students use calendar feature – only two respondents stated that they find
calendar feature as helping them being productive. One respondent stated that
Moodle is just for contacting the teacher, and the calendar feature is not used.
Three students stated that productivity also depends on the course, the information,
or how the teacher organizes and structures that information. One even stated that
productivity comes only from the quality of information, rather than from Moodle
at all. Two respondents stated that structuring the content, such as separation by
topics, helps to become more productive. The opposite of this – the lack of
separation by topics – leads to the “wall of text” effect, when the course loses in
informativity. Two stated that they considered Moodle to be productive because it
was better to search for information in Moodle, rather than in the library, and the
teacher helped with this by providing extracts from course books and articles to
read. Two stated that Moodle by itself encourages to be productive – one felt that
she had to start doing stuff when she logged into Moodle, whereas the other
mentioned percentages that allowed to monitor the completion of the courses.

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

People generally tend to state that Moodle was not novel for them for multiple
reasons – 11 people stated that it was not novel directly. However, there were some
stating that it was still novel for them. 9 stated that they had used Moodle for a long
time, out of which only a couple stated that Moodle at least partially remained novel
for them. Simultaneously, 5 respondents confessed that Moodle was novel at first
when they first started using it. In particular, 3 respondents stated that Moodle was
not novel because they have used other LMSs before, such as Wilma in high school.
When they used these other systems, the concept of LMS was novel to them;
however, it tended to change over a long period of use or regular, daily use (2
respondents). There were other less frequently mentioned topics. One stated feeling
confused at first in terms of having trouble distinguishing between Moodle and
other intranet platforms of the university. Another claimed that some things were
still novel, such as having difficulties with locating the courses to enroll, whether
features that are frequently used are not considered as novel. One stated that
everyone is using Moodle, so it does not feel novel. One mentioned that the layout
feels old, although the platform itself is a kind of novel. Finally, one stated that
Moodle does not have to be novel, nor that it could affect the enjoyment of using the
platform in any way.
There were certain troubles by the respondents in understanding the question.
Many people had asked what does the word novelty mean, with the researcher
consequently trying to explain it to the participants, sometimes with a metaphor of
how novel it was to have iPhone when it was first invented, and how novel it was
nowadays when many of people have smartphones. Sometimes, the researcher
translated the word novelty into Finnish (for the Finnish participants, who were
mostly asking for explanations) – uusi or uuden. Other informants, when asked the
question to rate novelty often started to explain how easy it was to use Moodle, after
which the researcher has asked them to focus on the novelty instead. In some of the
cases, informants described the novelty together with how difficult or easy it was to
use Moodle.

9 respondents stated that there were no problems that they have faced, whereas the
majority of other students stated that there were only minor problems encountered,
mostly related to technical issues. 7 said to have faced service breaks, such as server
downtime or website’s inaccessibility. However, they claimed that it was mostly at
night, and as such did not disturb them. Sometimes, they were informed in advance
about the potential service breaks, which also helped them to limit the disturbance
from service breaks. Other problems were mentioned by single respondents, some
of these said that they suspected that these might have been not on the user’s side
(such as slow PC connection). There were occasional problems of logging in.
Sometimes Moodle worked slowly or clunky. One stated that LMS did not work
smoothly for him in the beginning, but it became better later. The menu on the left
was also stated to be too long, so that not all of the courses could be seen. One was
concerned with occasional broken links (which could not be accessed via the
browser) provided by the teachers. Another stated that he did not personally
encounter any problems but heard stories of it. Finally, two students stated that
reliability depends on the teacher, whereas one commented that Moodle was easy
to use when answering this question.

People tend to agree that Moodle is generally efficient to use in studies. 5 stated that
Moodle helps in several ways with the school tasks and assignments, such as being
easy to submit the files in there for the teacher or to access the information needed
for completing the tasks. 3 claimed that Moodle is efficient if the content is
structured. As such, two of the students stated that efficiency depends on the teacher
and how he or she uses the Moodle. However, one student stated that efficiency
depends on him, whereas Moodle by itself provides all the necessary things in one
place in order to be efficient. Two stated that Moodle is efficient because it is clear –

such in terms of clearly structured content or clear visual representation. Two
stated that Moodle provides access to information and course content. Two stated
that Moodle is user-friendly. Two other students stated that Moodle complements
their studies. Two stated that Moodle motivates them to study and thus to be more
efficient in studying. There were several features outlined that are helping with
efficiency – a percentage of the course completion progress and the calendar.
Finally, one stated that Moodle helps in allocating the time for doing the tasks.

12 people stated that overall, Moodle is easy or intuitive to use, although underlining
different aspects of Moodle while stating that it is easy or intuitive to use and that
there are also some issues present in Moodle. 10 mentioned something concerning
the information that is represented in Moodle. 7 stated that they faced certain issues
with the courses in Moodle, such as having troubles of locating how to add new
courses (which required of them to locate not an obvious link) or issues with
categorizing and going to the content of the courses. Sometimes, however, these
issues were solved after users have used Moodle for some time. 5 others continued
that Moodle can be sometimes tricky to find information, such as the problems as
mentioned earlier with locating the courses to enroll. 2 of the informants also stated
that they had some problems with using the communication features of Moodle,
whereas one stated that the feature of discussion forums was most user-friendly in
Moodle.
6 described user-friendliness of Moodle with respect to the users’ experience or
length of using Moodle, mostly stating that the use of Moodle has become easier over
time, although there might have been some issues in the beginning of the use of
Moodle. For example, one informant mentioned, “I learned to use it in a pretty short
period of time.” 5 mentioned layout or user interface of Moodle to be somehow
related to the user-friendliness. Some found this part of being clear and minimalistic,
as well as user-friendly, whereas others said that layout is not user friendly and

55

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

should be improved, in particular how new courses are added. 4 stated that userfriendliness depends on the course or the teacher. Two users stated that the mobile
version of Moodle is not very user-friendly and should be made more such. 7
respondents proposed improvement ideas in terms of user-friendliness of Moodle.
Among the suggestions are to categorize information in Moodle, to make locating
the enrollment to courses feature easier, to be able to filter or categorize the courses
according to the user’s criteria, to make a help to-do list in terms of how to use
Moodle, and to make more interactive links in Moodle.

Users either were stating that the attractiveness of Moodle is either neutral or plain
or that Moodle was boring. In one student’s words, a lengthy experience of using
Moodle has caused it to be boring. 3 students claimed that Moodle was not attractive
to them. Simultaneously, many of the respondents stated that Moodle does not have
to be attractive (4 respondents), whereas others stated that they liked the
attractiveness of Moodle that was judged to be clear, simple, or minimalistic (4
respondents). 7 respondents stated something concerning the colours of Moodle –
either stating that they are “pretty good,” or that they are too stale and lack the
colourfulness. One student proposed to use brighter colours, whereas another
student proposed to use the university’s official colours (yellow and red) in the
design of Moodle. Fonts not described as attractive by one student, who proposed
to make fonts more interesting to improve the attractiveness of Moodle, for
example, by having different fonts for different types of information. At the same
time, the structure of Moodle was characterized as interactive and pleasant to use
by another informant. One student stated that attractiveness depends on how the
teacher customizes the layout of Moodle.

The students were somewhat divided on the topic of enjoyment from the use of
Moodle. Some acknowledged that they enjoyed using Moodle. Some stated that they
were neutral about the enjoyment of the use of Moodle. At the same time, among
other students, the understanding by some was that Moodle was just a tool for
studies, and hence enjoyment was not important (4 students). Simultaneously,
among these coded references from respondents, frequently, students were
contradicting. For example, quoting one, he stated that “It’s school work, I’d rather
not do it. The positive thing about it is that it works on the phone really well. So, I could
say I enjoy using it because it works on the phone really well.” One stated that Moodle
was not enjoyful. One said that she enjoyed using Moodle sometimes – namely
because Moodle had everything in one place.
5 students commented that they found Moodle easy and simple to use. 4 other stated
that they enjoyed Moodle for the fact that everything in Moodle was in one place.
One mentioned that she enjoyed using Moodle because it helped in finding helpful
information about the courses. 3 stated something concerning the communication
of Moodle. One enjoyed using the communication features of Moodle. The other two
proposed to improve Moodle by implementing a chat function or thinking about the
ways of communication in the courses, such as providing Q&A and contact with us
sections – thus with the potential to increase the enjoyment from using Moodle. Two
stated that enjoyment from using Moodle depends on the course, such as having
interactive content would increase the enjoyment of using Moodle. One stated that
it was enjoyful to use Moodle because of its design.
One stated that using a mobile version of Moodle was challenging because Moodle
did not have its own media player, and the links frequently led to external links to

57

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

media hosted on a YouTube. As a result, she had to watch advertisements due to the
lack of special software on the mobile YouTube to block the ads. In addition, quoting
the respondent, “then in my video suggestions there will be just a bunch of crap about
school, mixed with the content I usually watch,” such as information behavior models
mixed with content about losing weight. At the same time, another student said that
he enjoyed using Moodle because it was working really well on the phone.
Comparing with YouTube, another student stated that enjoyment from YouTube and
Moodle differed in that Moodle demanded more active use, whereas YouTube was
more about passive browsing and viewing of recommended videos. YouTube was
also found to be more visual, whereas Moodle less so.

The majority of students (13) state that Moodle is somewhat good in terms of its
fulfilness, whereas 2 stated that it is not good or that it does not help in that regard,
and 1 mentioned it to be somewhat neutral. Many stated that Moodle’s fulfilness is
affected by the teacher (6), whereas one student stated that she found that Moodle
provides all the necessary opportunities, and the fulfilness depends on her and how
she uses Moodle.
Frequently students were asked whether Moodle has helped them to improve or
increase their grades (12) – either as a question that explains what fulfilness means
or as an additional question to the standardized semi-structured question. As a
result, 10 considered that Moodle either improved or has given opportunities to
improve grades of the students. Grades might have been improved because of
having information regarding the criteria for how the assignments will be evaluated
58

(3), being an easy place to access useful information (3), or by reading uploaded
extra material uploaded by the teachers (1).
Other ways included being able to interact with a material in a different way, such
as reading digital information and extracts from the books instead of whole books
(2). Tests were found to be positive for increasing grades (2). There were also some
features that were positively outlined by students as having the potential to improve
their grades: a calendar feature (1), ticking boxes near tasks signifying completion
of them (1), or an ability to upload and download assignments (1). Simultaneously,
2 students stated that Moodle does not help increasing grades, with one stating that
it depends on the teacher, rather than on Moodle. Additionally, other things were
mentioned by the informants. The layout was mentioned to be working fine (1).
Sharing files were somehow related to the fulfilness of Moodle (5), which is
mentioned either as the only feature that is used or as the feature that helps
increasing grades.

Comprehensiveness was evaluated to be somewhat good or helpful (5), neutral or
ok (4) and being bad or not that helpful (5) by a roughly equal number of
respondents. 2 stated that the comprehensiveness depends on how the teacher has
structured the course content and whether the information structured in a clear and
accessible way. One student commented that roughly 30% of courses are poorly
structured, 50% are ok, and 20% are good in the sense of how the course is
structured by the teacher.
14 respondents commented on something on the communication methods as part
of their answers: discussion forums (11), in-person communication (2), e-mail (1),
59

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

personal messages (1), wiki (1), and Q&A section (1). Discussion forums were noted
by some to be helpful and having interesting discussions that may help with the
understanding of teachers or students. Others stated there are certain issues with
discussion forums, such as a feeling of a “fake” or “unreal” discussion, that it may be
hard to express oneself through Moodle because only of being able to use texts
(instead of other media like images or videos), or that forums are not often used. As
a result, in-person communication or e-mails were sometimes preferred to
communicate through Moodle, especially with teachers. Certain improvements are
suggested, such as personal messages, wikis, and Q&A sections to be more widely
used, as they were noted to be useful and helpful, but not widely used.
10 respondents mentioned things related to other people when answering the
question. They mentioned communication with other students (9), with teachers
(5). It is suggested that comprehensiveness provided by Moodle differs for
communication with students and with teachers, as well as different problems when
communicating with students or with teachers. Teacher’s encouragement (1) might
have been helpful in terms of using discussion forums. Issues with personalities of
other people (1) and issues with words used by others (1) when communicating
through Moodle might have decreased the comprehensiveness.

Moodle was characterized as meaningful by most of the informants, in particular by
providing meaningful information, although there were some, who stated that
Moodle was ok, neutral or that Moodle by itself is a “blank slate and it depends on
what type of information the teacher uploads there.” Moodle was also found to be
facilitating studying (2). Furthermore, there were some who claimed that
meaningfulness of Moodle depends on how the teacher structures the content (9).
Multiple people stated something concerning the course content (6): that the
content should be structured simple and clear; powerpoints, articles, and pdf files
were found to be meaningful; and that the content is the main factor affecting
meaningfulness of Moodle. Additionally, Moodle provides interaction with digital
materials not possible otherwise (1). Furthermore, 3 students stated that they
consider extra articles published by the teachers to be meaningful, although they are
60

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

not always read if a student does not have the time or considers to have already
acknowledged the content of the extra article in previous studies. The presence of
tasks and deadlines in Moodle were characterized to be meaningful (3), and
calendar as a feature improves the use of that meaningful information (1).

Many people stated that they felt engaged by the Moodle, whereas one stated that it
was neutral, and one mentioned that Moodle does not really engage. One mentioned
high daily use as a justification of rating engagement as pretty high. The course
content was frequently mentioned in the responses. Visuality and different types of
content, such as images and videos, were positively rated by 3 respondents and
were preferred to read a text material, whereas one stated that reading a physical
book was preferred to viewing digital content. The interactivity of the content (1) or
having everything in one place that allows for an overview to plan studies (1) were
also found to be facilitating engagement. One respondent also mentioned that she
would have preferred to have interesting content as an engaging one, although she
has stated that she realized that it is not always possible when studying. 6
respondents stated that engagement depends on how a teacher structures content
of a course. Furthermore, the teacher was noted to be an engaging factor by some
(4).
Simultaneously, 5 spoke of engagement having a somehow forced engagement:
being told by the teacher, or because a student has to. One mentioned that she felt
that she had to study when she opened Moodle. Tasks were noted in the responses

(5): deadlines of assignments (4) and having to send assignments via Moodle (2)
increased engagement. Additionally, there were some features that were mentioned
by the respondents as engaging: task quizzes (2), easiness of downloading
documents (1), final course evaluation survey that is placed in Moodle (1), and
percentage bar of completing tasks (1). One student commented that Moodle makes
it easy to study.

People generally tend to be neutral, whereas a few expressed it to be good or bad.
However, 6 respondents confirmed that Moodle allows in principle to communicate,
but some of these informants stated that they prefer not to use it due to some
reasons. Furthermore, communication with students (8) and with teachers (11) was
described in separate terms. It was stated that, for the most part, communicating
with teachers is more widespread with the use of Moodle than with the peers,
however many preferred communicating with the teachers by e-mail.
Discussion forums were frequently mentioned (13) by the informants as the main
feature that provides the communicativeness of Moodle. Even though some students
were noted to enjoy using discussion forums to foster learning, much more
explicated that the communication there felt too formal. Eight said that discussion
forums were not used or used very little, although some admitted that the possibility
through Moodle to communicate is present. The use of discussion forums was
discussed in the context of use by others (6). Some said that if others used it more
frequently and more actively, informants would have considered using it as well.
Others stated that they felt that the tonality used by others when communicating on
discussion forums was too formal and forced, as part of having to discuss in the
teachers’ assignments. One respondent felt that if the teacher engaged in using
discussion forums more, it would have really helped. Furthermore, she expressed
her feeling of trying to avoid asking “stupid questions” by avoiding asking at all,
62

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

although she also realized that others might have similar thoughts. Finally, 5
expressed Moodle’s messaging system to be not suitable for their styles of
communication. One informant has summarized it pretty well: “It’s not a chat, it’s
old-school, where you write a blog post.” As a result, some have stated that this does
not allow for a lively discussion between students, which makes the discussions feel
formal and somewhat surficial.
Four students stated something concerning face-to-face communication. One
student of Philosophy stated that personal communication is preferred to other
modes of communication. Another student stated that for group work, the meeting
at the university is preferred unless there is a lack of time when Facebook or
WhatsApp would be used. 2 students said that they could communicate with the
teachers by uploading tasks in Moodle. Finally, one mentioned that at the beginning
of studies, when one does not know many people yet, Moodle could be very useful
because it helps to get to know each other, after which it would be possible to
transition to other platforms. It was stated that frequently, other messaging
platforms (8) were used (WhatsApp, e-mail, Facebook) – either instead of or in
addition to that of Moodle’s features that allow communicating, like discussion
forums.

Many people stated in some way that Moodle does not provide features for
collaboration or that it is bad, whereas few said that it was good or somewhat
neutral. Some recognized that Moodle provides opportunities for collaboration (2),
but they are not necessarily used. Multiple people (5) stated that they perceived the

63

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

answer to the 16th question being the same as to the previous 15th question about
communicativeness.
Discussion forums were mentioned (6). Two stated that discussion forums felt
somewhat “old-school,” “blogpost-y,” and would have preferred instant messaging.
One student mentioned that there was not much of a discussion on the forums, but
instead, people expressing their opinions, even when responding to others’ posts as
part of doing assignments. Interestingly, six respondents mentioned group chats or
private sections on discussion forums: some stated that they liked using the feature
and “it was really collaborative,” whereas others stated that they would have liked
that feature to appear so that their collaboration would be improved. One informant
stated that if the teacher were to create separate sections only visible to group
members, then that would be a good tool, but the informant was not sure if it was
present or not. Another mentioned that group chats could be improved, especially if
there is no possibility to meet other people elsehow, such as in online courses.
Four students stated that they liked Moodle for finding contact information, but then
some of these proceeded to use other platforms, such as e-mail or instant
messengers. Many people referred to side platforms (11), such as using WhatsApp,
Google Drive, or e-mails for collaborating. Face-to-face communication was
mentioned several times (5). Some stated that they preferred this type of
communication to use Moodle. However, one student mentioned that discussion
forums were better than face-to-face communication because the students had
separate schedules, and as such, it was easier to collaborate over Moodle.
Furthermore, another student stated that communication over Moodle was better
because it was formal and because it was not required to share personal contact
information, like a telephone number. Three students expressed concern over the
lack of possibility to collaborate on the shared documents, similar to that in Google
Drive. Thus, many used other platforms like Google Drive and simply uploaded tasks
in Moodle. One stated that Moodle helped with collaboration over other methods of
communication by providing information about the assignments.

The majority of people expressed that they find the confidence quite high when
using Moodle, although one person stated that she did not trust using Moodle
because she did not know who would see the information posted by her. Some
people asked to explain the question, for which the researcher has explained that
the question asks to evaluate the confidence and feeling secure when interacting
over discussion forums as an example. One commented that technically this
confidence over Moodle did not exist since no communication existed in Moodle in
the first place due to a small group of 7 people instead of 100 people and the
prevalence of personal communication.
Four stated that they trusted communication in Moodle because they believed that
Moodle is a university-based platform and that most of the users are students –
those who are supposed to be enrolled in the university. Two stated that assurance
by the teacher or by the official employee from the university that the
communication and the use of Moodle are secure had elevated the students’
confidence. Three stated that they trusted interactions over Moodle to be secure.
One said, “I have not interacted with anyone but teachers, so it’s not like a social media
in that way.” Another mentioned that he believed that only the teacher would see
the information. Some mentioned that they felt that there was a potential for leakage
of information. One stated, “the info that is on Moodle about me – my name, my Åbo
Akademi e-mail address – that would not be a big deal.” Simultaneously, another
person, the one who did not feel secure, stated that she felt the grades was sensitive
information, but she could easily share her assignments without feeling threatened.
Finally, one stated that there was formal communication, which added to the
confidence. Another stated that there was too much mandatory communication as
part of having to discuss assignments there. Thus, communication did not feel real.
By having to have a key to enroll to the course was mentioned to have the potential
to increase the confidence in the safe communication on Moodle. One stated that
opinions could have been expressed freely over Moodle. Two mentioned that the
problems with confidence came not from the security, but from that, these students
were not sure when others would reply. Moreover, as such, it was hard to plan how
the discussions of assignments would proceed, often leading to the last-minute
discussions before the deadlines set up by the teacher.

Some students evaluated attentiveness as good or relatively high. Some students
stated that they considered attentiveness of Moodle to be bad or relatively low, and
one stated that it is somewhat neutral. For the most part, many students (11) spoke
about e-mail notifications that they received when someone posted something in
Moodle, be it a teacher or a student, in different places – a discussion forum, a chat,
or a notification from the teacher. One student mentioned a certain degree of
randomness: “sometimes you get e-mails that are relevant, sometimes you do not, and
sometimes you get e-mails every time and that’s very annoying.” As a matter of fact,
six students stated that sometimes they got too much irrelevant to them
notifications, and for some, it was annoying. For the most part, students were found
to try only to read posts that were relevant to them (6), ignoring irrelevant ones.
However, one student stated that he was reading all of the e-mails, but not
responding to them. Two stated that filter notifications would have helped with the
situation.
Four mentioned teachers in their responses, and as such, the types of attentiveness
are different for the teachers than for the students. One student stated that she
becomes attentive to the information if the teacher states that it is compulsory to
discuss as part of an assignment on the discussion forums. Another stated that he
did not always receive info from the teacher, but only from the students. For one,
attentiveness of Moodle was useful, because through Moodle, a teacher was able to
reschedule the course. Finally, one rated attentiveness very low since she felt that it
was only her and the teacher communicating on Moodle. Multiple other students
stated that the main attentiveness they got from others was when other students
were discussing something over Moodle in the discussion forums.
Two stated that they would have preferred some sort of mobile app to improve the
attentiveness of Moodle. Two mentioned that attentiveness depends on themselves

as students and how they use an LMS. One said that he expects the information to
come from other channels first, rather than from Moodle, such as from messengers,
for another attentiveness was good because it was possible to read the course
content in advance before the lecture. For one to improve attentiveness, it was
better if there were more interactive ways of discussing via the Moodle. The ability
to send direct messages in Moodle was found helpful for making one attentive to
others by one informant.

The responsiveness of Moodle was described as somewhat good for certain reasons,
although there were found certain issues. Three admitted that there are
mechanisms for responding to others, but sometimes these were thought as not
being used. Many people spoke about previously discussed in the 18th question
feature of notifications. Ten students spoke about methods of responding to
information. Five mentioned that they sometimes responded to the information
because they have had to. Two simply acknowledged information without
responding. Two stated that they always answer to another person. One stated that
he was not responding at all, whereas another mentioned that he is interested only
in information that is relevant to him.
Different features were discussed in terms of what features are related to
responsiveness in Moodle: discussion forums (3), grades (2), and wiki (1). Three
mentioned commenting on others as a method of responsiveness in Moodle. Direct

67

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

messaging or chat function was also mentioned – some said that this feature is not
present, whereas others stated that they did not observe the function working
correctly. The main reason for wanting the feature of chat or direct messaging was
that it would allow for sending information that the user would not have liked to be
observed by others.
Two proposed to make a mobile app since that would have allowed to check and
respond better over mobile version than over PC, which is not always accessible.
One mentioned randomness in responsiveness due to not always receiving
notifications about new information. The teacher was mentioned either as
increasing responsiveness by engaging students to discuss or as the person who
could explain how to use Moodle better for responding to others. One stated that
responsiveness depends on how users are using Moodle.

Informants spoke of many issues that were mentioned only by one or a few other
students. Two stated that helpfulness depends on the course. One said that Moodle
provides possibilities to help, whereas another student said that Moodle does not
help at all. Some people mentioned that they or someone else could have used
Moodle to reach out for help. One student has characterized discussion forums as
the most helpful part of Moodle. Another stated that it would have been more helpful
if students, when asking for help from the teacher, used discussion forums that are
visible for everyone, instead of sending e-mails that are only visible to the teacher.

Five students mentioned other platforms when answering. Some said that they
would prefer to seek help by using other platforms. Two mentioned extra articles
posted by teachers, but also by other students as being helpful to them. Additionally,
information posted by others was helpful. Personal communication was preferred
by two students for some issues. One stated that Moodle was not suitable for
discussing some questions, like drawing mathematical formulas. Deadlines in
Moodle were mentioned to be helpful. Helpfulness was also mentioned to be
different if the communication is with students or with teachers.

Overall, 17 people have stated that communication has been respectful in Moodle,
most of whom stated that they had not seen any issues in that regard. One expressed
doubt when ranking because she said that she did not experience much
communication over Moodle. Four stated that communication over Moodle is
respectful because it was the university’s platform. Five classified communication
in Moodle as formal and official. One said that Moodle is a small university, and thus
the communication must be respectful.
However, there were noted some other issues when communicating with others.
Two said that there was some hidden tension when arguing with others over the
Moodle; some feelings of irritation, annoyance, and anger were felt. One stated that
the nature of the tension came from being dependent on the good feedback and
agreement since that might have affected the grade. At the same time, one said that
even though there were some arguments, they agreed to disagree, and thus, there
was no tension. Some other informants, when asked whether they experienced
similar tensions in discussions, stated that they did not. One mentioned that there
were certain issues with others’ personalities, shown in the difficulties of
communicating efficiently. Potential difficulties in understanding each other’s point
of view were also mentioned (1). Finally, one stated that there were some issues

with the timing of posts – such as difficulties of engaging in an effective discussion
because the discussion has already ended.

All of the students stated that they are convinced that they will use Moodle as part
of their studies. Many stated that they would use it as long as they are students, but
after graduation, they would continue using Moodle only if it is part of their studies
or part of their work. Five said that they might be using Moodle after graduation,
whereas three stated that they would not use Moodle after graduation. One
mentioned that it was not possible to use Moodle anyway, since, after graduation as
a student, the access is lost. Seven mentioned that they are convinced because they
have to use it – either because everyone around them uses it, or because the teacher
demands them to use it. One said that she was convinced of using Moodle since all
of the courses are e-courses, which are only available in Moodle.

Some students state that they are willing to use Moodle (9), some stated that they
are somehow neutral (5), and some stated that they are not willing to use Moodle
(2). However, many respondents state that they are willing to use Moodle from the
point of view as a tool for studying, which has a utilitarian use. The researcher has
inquired some of the informants whether the willingness is the same or different to
other platforms, such as YouTube, and the response was that the willingness to use
is different because the purpose is different (entertainment instead of studying).
Additionally, one respondent stated that the purpose of using YouTube is different
(more passive information consumption) than the purpose of using Moodle (more
active work with the information).
As such, 9 students stated that Moodle is for studies or for work. Six continued that
they will use Moodle if they have to, but some of them explained do not have any
problem with using Moodle. Five mentioned their willingness to use Moodle in the
context of its easiness or familiarity. Two others stated that Moodle could facilitate
studying; hence they might be willing to use Moodle. Two stated that it is the only
tool or choice that they have to use. Two mentioned other platforms. One
mentioned, “I think if people wanted to learn, then they would go to Udemy or some
other learning platform.” Another mentioned an LMS that was on his exchange that
was clearer and more structured.
One mentioned that willingness to use Moodle depends on the willingness to study.
Another stated that willingness to use Moodle depends on the tiredness or
emotional state of the student. One stated that if there were a mobile app, he would
have had a higher willingness to use Moodle. One mentioned that he would go on
Moodle to browse for reading extra material in which he is interested. However, he
also mentioned that there are some courses that require being enrolled, and as such,
proposed an improvement idea that if the courses were open to non-students, he
would have been more willing to use Moodle.

Most people recommended Moodle to be used for different reasons, whereas some
were neutral. Six mentioned evaluation of how much they would recommend
Moodle to be used in the context of other LMS that they have used in the past. Five
comment their answers that they have not used other LMS, sometimes stating that
there might be other better options. Occasionally the researcher has asked to
elaborate on the interviewers’ answers to the reasons based on which they would
and would not recommend Moodle.
Students mentioned that they would recommend Moodle because it is easy to use
(7), all relevant information is placed conveniently in the same place (5), easy to
send tasks to the teacher for evaluation (4), easy to receive information from the
teacher (3). There were also less frequent mentions: that Moodle has a clear

structure (2), offers basic functionality (2), it is efficient to use (1), easy for teachers
to administer Moodle (1), that in Moodle it is possible to monitor the studying
process (1), that Moodle facilitates studying (1) and that the design is liked (1).
Several students would not recommend or suggest to improve before being able to
recommend these things: communication in Moodle, including group
communication (5), user-friendliness of Moodle (3), hard to locate and use course
enrollment (3), Layout or UI (3), discussion forums (2), usability issues (2).
Additionally, there were specific topics that were mentioned by single respondents:
lack of customizability of the front page, lack of mobile app, navigation of Moodle.
Furthermore, some stated that they would have liked to make the course list clearer,
to optimize technical stuff, to provide open access for non-enrolled students to some
courses, and to provide instant notifications when teachers post something.
4.3.

Verification of the results

Groves and Lyberg (2010) define Total Survey Error (TSE) as a conceptual
framework describing the statistical error properties of sample survey statistics,
which incorporates a variety of error sources. Groves et al. (2011, p. 34) state that
the Total Survey Error (TSE) approach means taking into account a broad
perspective and making sure that no feature of the survey is designed in such a way
that it undermines the ability of the survey to accomplish its goals. Biemer (2010, p.
817-818) states: “Total survey error (TSE) refers to the accumulation of all errors that
may arise in the design, collection, processing, and analysis of survey data. In this
context, a survey error is defined as the deviation of a survey response from its true
underlying value. A related term—survey accuracy—is defined as the deviation of a
survey estimate from its underlying true parameter value. Survey errors can arise from
the survey frame deficiencies, the sampling process, interviewing and interviewers,
respondents, missing data, and coding, keying, and editing processes. Survey error is
problematic because it diminishes the accuracy of inferences derived from the survey
data. A survey estimator will be accurate if it has a small bias and variance, which
occurs only if the influence of TSE on the estimate is small.” Groves et al. (2004)
present Total Survey Error Components Linked to Steps in the Measurement and
Representational Inference Process (Figure 20). TSE is hence used in contemporary
research as a way to verify the results, which are based on surveying and
interviewing users. Survey Statistic is understood in this study as any data coming
from the respondent – qualitative or quantitative.

Inferential Population is “Students using a Learning Management System (LMS).”
Inferential Population may be somewhat hard to name, given that the concept of UX
of an LMS may exist at several levels. For example, UX of an LMS may exist for
students in universities, or for users who are not enrolled as students in the
university, but who are studying, nevertheless. Target Population is more specific,
which is “enrolled students who are using Moodle at an Åbo Akademi University in
Turku, Finland.”
Coverage Error in TSE is understood as the duplication of collecting surveys several
times from the same respondents (overcoverage) or from omitting respondents
with certain characteristics from the sample (undercoverage), hence changing the
results of the data. The researcher has interviewed those students, who were not
interviewed before by remembering the faces of the respondents. Some previously
interviewed respondents were approached by the interviewer, but these
respondents reminded that they were interviewed before. Respondents were also
inquired whether they were currently enrolled as students of Åbo Akademi
University, and those who were not were excused from being interviewed.
Overcoverage may come only from the fact that certain respondents with certain
characteristics may be overrepresented (for example, students with a major in
Business). To this, undercoverage is more potentially troubling.
Undercoverage is potentially more present, given that there are several thousands
of students at the Åbo Akademi University, while only 20 students were interviewed
in a sample. In order to address the issue to some extent, extra data about
respondents was collected so as to be able to understand whether there is some
potential undercoverage. In the sample, there are no Ph.D. students, and the study
majors are not equally distributed, with some being less mentioned than others.
Additionally, the respondents were approached physically at two of the several
campuses of Åbo Akademi University in Turku. Some students may have been
abroad from the country, studying remotely or being present at other campuses.
Hence, undercoverage may represent among the biggest threats to the validity of
the results, which is partly due to the qualitative-driven methodology.

74

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Sampling Error is another potentially troublesome threat to the validity and
reliability of the results. Given that the sampling method is convenience sampling,
which is a method to choose participants who are available and easy to find, there is
potential towards bias, the more the variation in the population (Saunders et al.,
2009, p. 241). Variation in the population may be significant, and thus the results
may not accurately represent the variation. Convenience sampling may have
contributed to both the Coverage and Sampling Errors.
Non-response Error is estimated by calculating the number of respondents who
refused the interviewing. There were 71.14% of respondents out of the total who
agreed to be interviewed. As a result, roughly 29% of the respondents did not
respond, potentially contributing to the non-response bias. The main reason for
non-response was that the respondents did not have enough time for the interview
at the time of approach. Non-response bias has the main risk of omitting
respondents with specific characteristics that may not have been included in the
data analysis results, hence potentially jeopardizing the validity and reliability of the
results.
Validity, which is a measure describing the potential error between Construct and
Measurement, is primarily based on the validity of the holistic UX model as devised
by Topolewski et al. (2019), which is applied in a different context (LMS instead of
a mobile feedback-collecting app). RQ3, more or less, makes an attempt at
evaluating the Validity – how well the model can be applied to measure the UX.
Holistic UX model is found to measure UX of an LMS broadly. Since UX is a concept
that is holistic, fuzzy, and hard-to-define, the model has a slight lack of focus on the
specific elements of the UX, which is expected.
Measurement Error is a measure between Measurement and elicited Responses
from the respondents. This error is primarily based on the respondents’
understanding of the questions, the potential bias of the researcher on the
respondents’ answers, and how the respondents have managed to communicate
their thoughts in the interview and survey. In order to address the Measurement
Error, there are certain actions taken by the researcher in the process of data
collection and data analysis. In particular, answers inconsistency in the responses
were evaluated by the researcher, which is described in detail below. Summarizing
the results in advance, one shall expect roughly 70% of consistent data (i.e.,
qualitative and quantitative data that is not contradicting each other greatly).
Additionally, the researcher has taken an active approach in trying to explain and
facilitate the understanding of the questions by the respondents by explaining and
elaborating on the questions asked. However, as Sanders (2002) put, there are
several levels of what people say, do, and make, going from explicit to latent needs.
It is likely that interviewing as a methodology was able to scratch the surface – what
people say. Some respondents stated that they were in a hurry, while others stated
they had changed some answers after reflection. As a result, the Measurement Error
may have been affected significantly by the topic of research, which is trying to
analyze a construct of UX, which is highly subjective in itself. Data results thus may
have been at the surficial level of what people say, as well as their explicit needs.

75

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

During the data collection stage, the researcher made sure that the questionnaire
was filled by the respondent properly without double-marking or missing
questions. Occasionally, if that happened, the respondent was asked to fix the
mistake. This has happened several times at the stage of data collection.
Additionally, the researcher has verified from time to time the consistency of the
quantitative data with qualitative data (i.e., words of the interviewer). Not all of the
inconsistencies were noticed by the researcher, nor is it claimed that they exist since
the researcher’s subjective judgment was used to see if the words differed from the
quantitative score. When the inconsistency was noticed, the interviewer has asked
a question for why such an inconsistency might exist. As a result, six respondents
were asked for the reasons for such potential inconsistency. There were several
reasons for why participants might have given a differing quantitative score than
what was a qualitative comment. Five said that the answer might have changed after
the reflection. One stated that he has ranked slightly lower in the context of
respectful communication because even though he did not observe the disrespect,
he suspected that disrespect might exist somewhere. Another stated that for him, it
is quite hard to put a perfect 7, even if there are no issues, since “that’s how people
are generally,” in addition to having the time for reflections that changed the score.
One student admitted that she was in a hurry and did not answer thoughtfully when
ranking 22nd, 23rd, and 24th questions, even though she said in the interview that the
answer score is “high,” and as such quantitative scores could be increased. The
researcher has increased the grades from 2 to 6 for that student as a result of that
feedback. For other inconsistencies, the researcher has not taken adjustments since
the respondents did not state that the score could be increased. Furthermore, the
evaluation of inconsistencies was not a part of the methodology, and as such, was
not expected and could not be considered systematic for all of the responses. Finally,
two stated that wording of the questions and as such meaning associated could have
changed the understanding in the informants’ minds of what was being evaluated,
thus changing the score.
The researcher has coded the qualitative responses by informants into three
evaluation codes for each of the UX property questions: positive/good, neutral, and
negative/bad. Before inputting these values into the common table, the researcher
has verified that there was no double-coding of the same response in two different
qualitative evaluation categories. These evaluation categories were then compared
with quantitative responses to estimate the degree of potential inconsistency. In
order to determine whether an answer was inconsistent or not, the researcher has
counted if a corresponding attribute was given a score 1, 2, or 3 for the code
negative/bad; 4 for the code neutral; 5, 6, or 7 for the code positive/good. The table
for visualization purposes is represented below (Table 36).

consistent quantitative score.

For example, if the respondent stated that he believed the UX property was bad
while giving 4, 5, 6, or 7 – the answer was considered to be inconsistent. It is
important to underline that the results of whether an answer was or was not
consistent are significantly dependent on the researcher’s judgment of how to code
the answer qualitatively. In general, however, the answers were coded according to
the mentioned semantic meanings of the respondents (e.g., explicitly mentioning
that the UX property was “Good” or that “there were no problems,” hence the UX
property being coded as being positive). Total answers and consistent answers were
calculated for each individual UX property and the share of consistent answers
calculated as the consistent answers divided by the total answers. UX facets and UX
dimensions were calculated in a similar manner – the sum of all consistent UX
properties that make up the UX facet or UX dimension were divided by the sum of
total answers of the respective UX properties. Average consistency is calculated in
the low part of the table by dividing the sum of all consistent answers by the sum of
all total answers for all of the UX properties. Results of the consistency evaluation
may be seen below in Table 37 that analyzes the consistency for Female and Male,
and in Table 38, that analyzes the total consistency between the two genders, as well
as the difference between the shares of consistent answers.

Average Consistency

Seeing from the table, one could conclude that the average consistency of the
answers for the two genders was 70.3%, whereas the difference between the
genders for all answers was about 7%. From the differences across UX facets, it may
be seen that women were less consistent in their answers for Economical,
Emotional, Cognitive, and Intention to Use, with slight differences in Technological
UX facet. However, women were much more consistent than men when evaluating
UX properties related to Empathical UX facet, with the largest difference of about
32%, but a slight difference with more consistent answers in Interpersonal UX facet.
As a result, men more consistent when evaluating UX properties of Business, Human
UX dimensions, and their intention to use, whereas women were more consistent
when evaluating the Social UX dimension.
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relationship
between gender and the consistency of the answers. The null hypothesis assumes
that there’s no association between gender and the consistency of the answers. The
alternative hypothesis assumes that there is an association between the two
variables. As a result of the test, there’s no evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Hence the relation between these variables was not found significant, X2 (1, N =
367) = 2.1059, p = .146733.
Additionally, at the end of the interview, four respondents were asked whether it
was easier for them to understand the questions if there was the first quantitative
survey and then a semi-structured interview, or vice versa. Two informants stated
that it was better to have a quantitative survey and then semi-structured interviews
because they believed it could have helped to reflect on the questions and to find
mixed method data inconsistencies. Two others stated that it was better vice versa
because it was easier for them to reflect on the questions while speaking. The
sample is far from representative, but there are some reasons to believe that
quantitative or qualitative data collection first may have affected the data, but for
78

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

some, it might have helped to understand questions better and thus give more valid
answers.
Processing Error is a measure between Responses and Edited Data. The researcher
is the main contributor to this kind of error, with a potential contribution at the
stages of data transcription, quantitative, qualitative data analysis, as well as
quantification of qualitative data and analysis of the quantified data. The researcher
has listened through the audio recordings, carefully listening to the audios and
carefully transcribing the interview. Furthermore, the researcher has verified
several times that data is entered correctly in the results data table. At the stages of
quantitative and qualitative analysis, the data were analyzed with the help of
software to facilitate the reliability and validity of the resulting data. The researcher
has done several iterations at all stages of data analysis in order to extract more
meaning with greater reliability and validity. Qualitative analyzes of qualitative and
quantified data are possibly most susceptible to the Processing Error, due to the
high degree of reliance on the researcher’s judgments and understanding, which is
a methodological limitation. To address this issue, the researcher has described in
great detail the methodology and process of research itself, providing where
possible all of the data. A possible exception is interview transcriptions, given their
too large text volume for being placed in a thesis. Thus, the researcher has taken all
attempts at carefully analyzing the data and describing the logic of data analysis, so
that the validity and reliability may be verified by other researchers as much as
possible.
Summary of the Verification of the Results

To summarize the verification of the results, the TSE model adapted from Groves et
al. (2004) was used as a template to systematically analyze the potential errors and
biases contributing towards obscuring the data analysis results. At each of the stages
in TSE, it is seen that there are potential errors that may have obscured the results.
While some Errors (e.g., Coverage Error) are hard to estimate, other Errors (e.g.,
Non-Response Bias and Measurement Error in terms of consistency of answers) are
more accurately estimated. In general, verification of the results may be
summarized as satisfying, most of the potential errors and potential biases coming
from the rather innate methodological limitations of a qualitative-driven mixed
method study. Simultaneously, as in any scientific study, there are certain
limitations, which must be acknowledged when interpreting the results of the study,
which shall be described in the upcoming parts of the study.

Summary of Results

There are certain overwhelming results that arise as part of the data analysis.
Results related to all of the three Research Questions (RQs) are drawn further. RQ1
analyzes the UX of Moodle in general, based on the quantitative, qualitative, and
quantified data. RQ2 attempts to find whether there are gender differences in the
UX of Moodle based on the quantitative, qualitative, and quantified data. RQ3
evaluates the application of holistic UX in the context of LMS in the case of Moodle.

79

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

RQ1: What is the UX of the students, who use Moodle of Åbo Akademi University?

According to the quantitative analysis, it may be said that there are certain attributes
that are considered as good, whereas some are mentioned by the respondents as
acceptable or somewhat unsatisfactory. UX properties that are considered as good
or better: usefulness, pleasantness, productivity, reliability, efficiency, fulfilness,
meaningfulness, engagement, confidence, respectfulness, intention to use. Some UX
properties are between acceptable and somewhat good: user-friendliness,
enjoyment,
comprehensiveness,
communicativeness,
collaborativeness,
attentiveness, responsiveness, helpfulness. Some UX properties are less than
acceptable or somewhat bad: entertaining, novelty, attractiveness. The standard
deviation for most of the UX properties and intention to use is between 0.75 and 1.8.
Some UX properties are more variable (e.g., Novelty) than others (e.g., Productivity).
Furthermore, hierarchical clustering analysis shows that there are four clusters of
gradually diminishing UX for each consequent cluster. Students in cluster 1 have
good UX. Students in cluster 2 have somewhat good UX. Students in cluster 3 have
acceptable UX. Students in cluster 4 have somewhat bad UX. Most of the students
are in the 2nd and 3rd clusters (16 students in total), whereas in 1st and 4th clusters
are just 4 students. Thus, most of the students had UX, which is between acceptable
and somewhat good. Students that have good or somewhat bad UX are rare.
Contemporary research is qualitative-driven. In terms of qualitative data, the
analysis was comprehended on an extensive dataset of 20 semi-structured
interviews across different UX properties. A word cloud (uses synonyms)
represented below (Figure 21) may show an overall picture of the words that were
used by the participants in the interview.
Figure 21. Word cloud (including synonymous words) based on the qualitative data
analyzed in NVivo.

There were a lot of multiple topics mentioned by the respondents. Additionally,
there were occasional improvement ideas that were mentioned by the respondents
80

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

in relation to different UX properties. In total, there were established 331 different
topics that were mentioned by 20 respondents across the answers to the 24
questions. Topics such as “Total (unique),” “Evaluation” and grading scores “Good,”
“Bad,” “Neutral” were removed, since these were considered to be summaries of the
topics, and thus irrelevant to counting the number of topics. Most of these topics
were having approximately 15 to 20 mentions, lying at the right end of the
distribution. The different number topics that were mentioned in total by different
respondents are calculated and shown in Figure 22 below.
Figure 22. Distribution of the frequency when topics were mentioned (y-axis) by a
different number of respondents mentioning a certain topic (x-axis).

The distribution shows that most of the topics mentioned by single or a few
respondents, as shown on the left side of the chart. With a greater frequency of the
topic being mentioned by multiple respondents also decreased the number of such
topics. In other words, there were many topics that were mentioned by a few
respondents than there were topics that were commonly discussed. It is important
to underline here that the frequency of topics mentioned was calculated across the
UX properties, rather than as a whole (e.g., discussion forums mentioned by one
respondent in one question and by another single respondent in another question
are counted as two topics mentioned by a single respondent).
As a result, UX properties Pleasantness, Productivity, Reliability, User-friendliness,
Fulfillness,
Comprehensiveness,
Communicativeness,
Collaborativeness,
Attentiveness, and Convincingness had most discussed topics. The most mentioned
15 topics that have 10 or more respondents (at least 50% of the respondents)
mentioning them are outlined in the list below:
1 14 students mentioned that they were convinced that they would use
Moodle, given that they are a student when speaking of convincingness.
2 13 students mentioned discussion forums when speaking of
communicativeness.
3 13 students mentioned communication methods when speaking of
comprehensiveness.

81

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

4 12 students mentioned the capability to increase or not grades when
speaking of fulfilness.
5 12 students mentioned easiness or intuitiveness of Moodle when speaking of
user-friendliness.
6 11 students mentioned e-mail notifications when speaking of attentiveness.
7 11 students mentioned other platforms when speaking of collaborativeness.
8 11 students mentioned communication with teachers when speaking of
communicativeness.
9 11 students mentioned discussion forums when speaking of
comprehensiveness.
10 students mentioned easiness to find information when speaking of
productivity.
11 students mentioned how easy or hard it was to navigate or use Moodle when
speaking of pleasantness.
12 10 students mentioned other people when speaking of comprehensiveness.
13 10 students mentioned that Moodle helped to increase grade when speaking
of fulfilness.
14 10 students mentioned information retrieved on Moodle, for example, about
the courses when speaking about user-friendliness.
15 10 students mentioned different minor technical issues when speaking of
reliability.
Thus, as a result of the researcher’s tacit understanding of the collected data
achieved through extensive exposure to the data in the process of data analysis, and
based on the most mentioned topics, it is possible to characterize the UX of Moodle
in summary. It must be underlined that such a summary is just a model and may not
show the whole UX, which is multi-factor and more complex than a text summary.
Moodle is considered to be an easy and intuitive study-related tool to use that
facilitates the studying of the students, which provides usefulness, but not so much
entertainment and enjoyment unless it is related to the studies. Moodle was also
found to help increase the grades for many of the students to some extent, although
not for all of the students. For several students, Moodle helped with the engagement
in studying through several features, such as deadlines and a completion percentage
of the course. Many features of Moodle were rarely used, such as wikis, whereas
some more frequently used, such as discussion forums. Moodle was also found to be
generally quite reliable, with only minor technical issues that almost did not cause
any problems. Many students stated they had to use Moodle, although having no
problem with that, some even underlining that they are very dependent on Moodle
in their learning. Most students find Moodle to have an easy to use and navigate user
interface (UI), although some do not. UI was also characterized as neutral, pastel,
somewhat boring, and not attractive, although which did not concern students
much. Mostly Moodle is used by the students in order to retrieve the contact details
or the information about the course. However, many also outlined the usefulness of
the feature to send tasks to the teacher. Some users stated that looking up
information on Moodle was better than looking for the information in the libraries.
There were a few students who have characterized their UX as very limited, using
Moodle just to send the tasks or download documents and lecture slides. Although
Moodle was not considered novel, for most, it was not a problem, some even
82

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

suggesting that novelty may have a negative correlation with the ease of use due to
the lack of experience and skills of using Moodle.
Moodle was frequently discussed in the perspective of using it together with other
people in the social context or group dynamics. The UX of Moodle depends a great
deal on how teachers structure the course in many of the UX aspects. Furthermore,
many found the communication over Moodle to be formal and goal-oriented, yet dry
and hypocritical. There are certain features that help with communicating over
Moodle, although these are limited and may have to be improved. Discussion forums
feature was the most widely mentioned feature, which was characterized by many
of the students as old-school, although with some potential use if it were improved
to be more modern with the chat function and group communication. Furthermore,
the use of communicating features of Moodle differs if the communication is with
teachers, or with other students. To compensate for the lack of communicating and
collaborative functionalities of Moodle, many students refer to using other
platforms: YouTube, e-mail, Google Drive, WhatsApp, Facebook. Additionally, other
platforms, such as e-mail, YouTube, or links to external websites, are mentioned as
affecting the UX of Moodle – for example, notifications sent to e-mails help students
to be more attentive. Some find the UX to be improved by other platforms, whereas
some find UX of Moodle to be negatively affected.
RQ2: Are there any gender differences among the students in the UX of Moodle?

According to the quantitative data analysis, mean scores across the two genders
evaluating UX properties were to be at most up to 1.3. Furthermore, there were not
found a statistically significant difference in medians across the two populations of
students with two genders. Women were found to have statistically significant
higher variability in evaluations of UX properties, based on the performed MannWhitney U test on the standard deviations of the UX properties across the two
genders. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that 3rd cluster was approximately
even in terms of gender, whereas 2nd cluster was 70% male and 30% female. The
best and the worst UX in 1st and 4th clusters were exclusively women (albeit, these
were rare, and hence may be considered as outliers). Hierarchical clustering
analysis shows that men are more likely to have somewhat good UX, while women
were more variant UX since the best and the worst UX was had by women-only
clusters. Finally, both women and men were found to have equally inconsistent
qualitative and quantitative answers, according to the Chi-Square analysis.
Quantification of the qualitative data was employed to help find data that may
answer RQ2. The difference in the number of respondents mentioning a topic was
calculated for all of the UX properties. The difference is calculated by subtracting the
number of topic mentions by males from the number of topic mentions by females.
These differences were then extracted, and the frequencies of each were calculated,
which were consequently plotted in the histogram, shown in Figure 23 below. As
such, the left side of the histogram is devoted to the frequency of topics that were
mentioned more frequently by males, whereas the right side of the histogram shows
the number of topics, where females were more frequent. The center of the
histogram at 0 shows the number of topics equally mentioned by both of the
genders.
83

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Figure 23. Distribution of the frequency of the topics that have a difference in the
number of respondents of different gender mentioning topics.

As one may see, the distribution of topics that are mentioned by one male or female
has a little bit over half (58%) – 193 mentions. Together with the number of topics
that are mentioned solely by 0 respondents gives nearly three fourths (69%) – 228
topics. If we also include topics that were mentioned by 2 members more of one of
the genders, we arrive at a number that almost 9 out of 10 topics were not different
(89%) – 293 such topics. Thus, in general, respondents do not differ that much in
terms of mentioning the topics. However, the resulting data also states that 296
(90%) of the topics had at least a minor difference in the number of mentions across
genders.
Furthermore, there were a few topics that still were mentioned more by one gender
than the other – 10 topics or roughly 3% of all of the topics. These topics were
mentioned between 6 to 4 more of one gender than the other. The number of how
many members from one gender mention more the topic than another corresponds
to about 25% out of total respondents or almost 50% of one gender. In other words,
these topics were mentioned by at least a half of respondents of one gender, whereas
a few members of the other gender either rarely mentioned these topics or did not
mention them at all. Table 39 below shows the topics that were more frequently
mentioned by the two genders.
Table 39. Tabularized form of the topics that were mentioned most frequently by
the two genders.
Topics more frequently mentioned by
Females
Colours in the attractiveness were mentioned
by 6 females and 1 male.
Four more females mentioned that fulfillness
and engagement depend on the teacher, rather
than on Moodle (5 females and 1 male for each
topic).

Topics more frequently mentioned by
Males
Only 6 male respondents stated that Moodle
allows to communicate, but these
functionalities are not used.
5 more males stated that it was easy to find
information than did females in terms of
productivity (8 males and 3 females).

84

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

4 more females mentioned other people when
answering comprehensiveness (7 females and
3 males).

Other platforms were more frequently
mentioned by 5 males when measuring
collaborativeness (8 males and 3 females).

Finally, only 4 females and no males stated that
Moodle is clear, simple, and minimalistic.

Only four males stated that Moodle did not
need to be attractive and no females.

RQ3: Is the holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019) applicable for analyzing the UX of an
LMS?

Holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019) provided a good template of semistructured questions to use in trying to evaluate a rather fuzzy concept of UX. The
holistic UX model is allowing for a thorough inspection of many different aspects of
UX. At the same time, even though a thorough analysis provided by the model may
be helpful in some situations, but it is also quite time- and resource-consuming.
Many of the questions were similar to each other. It was also found that the same or
very similar topics were described by the respondents across different questions.
Thus, it is suggested that it is necessary to analyze the UX based not on separate
elements in separate questions but to combine these topics from separate questions
and to analyze the topics by combining them in different groups. A visualization to
facilitate understanding in Figure 24 below shows how different topics or themes
mentioned by respondents when answering semi-structured questions from the
questionnaire developed based on the holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019)
are rearranged into new UX model schemas where the mentioned topics are
combined in the categories of common topicality.
Figure 24. Visualization of how the holistic UX model tends to analyze the UX of an
LMS, and how new UX model schemas could be employed to facilitate the analysis
of UX.

For example, multiple features were discussed across different questions, such as
discussion forums or calendar. Instead of analyzing these features across the
questions by pieces, it was found that it’s easier to categorize all the information by
categories of topics that are relevant to that specific feature, such as “Discussion
85

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Forums” or “Calendar”. It would improve the speed of analysis as well as accuracy,
since in the process of this categorization some information might be lost, for
example, because the researcher has missed some topics in some of the questions.
Furthermore, since these features are discussed from multiple perspectives, the
resulting categorization by topics would provide a thorough perspective similarly
to the holistic UX model.
After the analysis of the answers to each of the 24 questions, the researcher has
proceeded to analyzing the data by making attempts at classifying the topics
mentioned by respondents into several categories. Categorization is inductive in
nature, which, as it was stated in the methodology, could be combined with the
deductive approach in the qualitative data analysis. As a result, based on the data,
the researcher has managed to establish four categories that were discussed by the
respondents. The first category is the types of uses of Moodle as an LMS. The second
category is about the functionality as in on a broader, more abstract level than the
types of uses of Moodle as an LMS. The third category is about the list of features in
Moodle, which are used for different types of uses of an LMS. The fourth category
deals with the layout or user interface (UI) of Moodle, which helps to connect the
systematic features with the types of uses, as a result forming a functionality of
Moodle. The categories are explained in more detail below. These categories are
interrelated and could be visualized as a multi-level model (Figure 25).
Figure 25. A developed conceptual model of UX of an LMS.

The model shows how user represented at the very bottom interacts with the UI or
layout of an LMS that consists out of several UI elements. Users may interact in the
context of the community of other users (students or teachers), who may also
interact with the UI. Both the user and the community of other users exist within an
organizational context that may determine how these interact with the UI of an LMS.
86

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

UI (or layout) of an LMS then provides a link to features of an LMS that may be
supported with the technical work of an LMS. Features of an LMS are providing for
the different uses of an LMS. As a result, different types of uses of an LMS provide
for a set of functionalities of an LMS. Hence, these functionalities determine the
capability for the satisfaction of the user’s needs. At every level, two-sided arrows
represent the possibility of elements to interact in multiple combinations, hence
providing a system that is greater than simply the work of the two features. For
example, a certain combination of UI elements, such as color scheme, fonts, and text,
may together form the feature of discussion forums. A combination of features of
discussion forums and wiki could help with using Moodle for communicating and
collaborating. The two uses of Moodle for communicating and collaborating
combined together may provide for the functionality of socializing, which may be
greater than simply just uses of collaborating or communicating separately.
Furthermore, the further the level is from the UI or layout, the greater the level of
abstraction and thus the lower possibility for direct observability (by the
respondent or the researcher). These categories form the usability of an LMS, which
is concerned with how an LMS works as a system of these elements at different
levels. It is important to underline that the difference between different levels of
usability of an LMS is fuzzy, for example, sending tasks to the teacher may be part of
a UI element, a feature, and the use of an LMS. The usability of an LMS and the
community of users affect the cognitive and emotional state of the user. The
emotional state of the user affects the user, thus influencing how an LMS is used.
User’s perceptions (e.g., beliefs or past experiences) may be forming a prism around
the user, thus forming a subjective view that could affect how all other elements are
perceived by the user. Thus, the usability of an LMS, how an LMS is used and
perceived by the user, who is placed in the social context of a community of users
and who is affected by the cognitive and emotional states in addition to the user’s
perceptions, are all elements that are forming a UX of an LMS. This definition is in
line with the definitions provided by the literature. Furthermore, the UX of an LMS
was found to be affected by the presence of other web-platforms (such as WhatsApp
or e-mails). The influence is two-way, since how other platforms are used also
affected by the UX of an LMS. How teachers plan and structure the work of an LMS
affected the UX of an LMS.
UI/Layout of an LMS

User Interface (UI) or a layout of an LMS includes the visual representation of what
a user sees and interacts with. This is the “face” of an LMS, and it is the main way of
how the user receives results from an LMS. UI consists out of visual elements: fonts,
images, videos, buttons, coloring scheme, hyperlinks, as well as design (i.e., how UI
elements are arranged in the layout) and other representations of media and UI
elements. These are the most “physical” representations of the usability provided
by an LMS. UI may be considered a part of UX, but at the most basic level, and UI’s
role is to serve as a connector between user and features, which is a level above in
terms of abstraction and observability for the user.

87

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Features of an LMS

Features of an LMS are about doing something with the information and are more
technical than the UI of an LMS. Features may be represented as UI elements, which
are modified according to the work of the feature. However, features are not the
same as UI elements. Features differ that they serve in a similar way to the
mathematical function: features take a certain input from the user (a student or a
teacher) in the form of information, operate with it in a certain way, and then give
the output. The output may be and usually is represented as a change in the UI
elements. For example, a user (student) posts some information on discussion
forums, which is a feature, through typing into a UI element represented by a text
box. The feature takes that information, stores it on the server, as a result changing
another UI element on the discussion forums, which is a post of text. Another
example could be when a user sends an assignment for evaluation to the teacher.
User clicks on the UI elements (buttons) that allow uploading the document to the
server, which is then (through modifying another UI element of an LMS) notifies the
teacher and allows him or her to retrieve the document sent by the teacher through
a modification of UI element. As a result, features are on a slightly more abstract
level than the UI elements. Features may be applied for different purposes by
different types of uses of an LMS.
Uses of an LMS

The use of an LMS can be characterized as an activity that relies on using features of
an LMS through interaction with the UI of an LMS, as described above. The first use
of an LMS is using Moodle to collaborate in studying, for example, through such
features as a wiki or shared files to edit or through the use of discussion forums.
Communicating with others is second use, which involves using Moodle for
communicating with teachers or students in general. Thirdly, Moodle could be used
to improve studying, which may be represented in the improved grades and higher
engagement to study. Fourth is about using Moodle for planning studies through the
use of calendar, deadlines, or the content overview of the course. Fifth use is about
retrieving practical information – contact details of teachers or students, deadlines
of the assignments, and information about the course. Sixth use is about retrieving
information related to studying itself, such as downloading files from Moodle that
contain study content. Final use is about uploading the information, mostly
represented in sending tasks and assignments for the teacher’s evaluation. Different
types of uses are generic categories with unclear boundaries and are obviously
interrelated with each other (such as communicating and collaborating for studying
or retrieving content information and practical information). As a result of different
uses, these form functionalities of an LMS.
Functionalities of an LMS

Functionality is about the user’s needs and the ability of an LMS to satisfy these
needs. Semi-structured questions developed based on a holistic UX model seem to
be aiming at asking questions to explore UX at that level. In other words,
functionalities of an LMS are almost identical to the UX properties from the holistic

88

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

UX model. The distinction is that these functionalities of an LMS are referred solely
to the system of an LMS in the pure, “concentrated” form. Participants, on the other
hand, when asked about the UX properties tended to mention a multitude of other
things, which are related to the functionalities of an LMS, but are not the
functionalities of an LMS per se. For example, when asked about the UX property
communicativeness, respondents tended to evaluate the functionality of an LMS
“communicativeness” – how Moodle satisfies the need of users for socializing.
However, users also tend to mention discussion forums in addition to using other
platforms, thus touching on multiple elements at different levels from the
conceptual model of a UX of an LMS.
In other words, similar to melting ore in order to separate slags from the metal, the
functionality of an LMS is an essence of an LMS to satisfy certain needs of users. The
functionality of an LMS is understood as the property of an LMS, which does not go
beyond the LMS itself. This is different from UX properties that seem to be
concerned with evaluating not just the functionality of an LMS, but also other related
things, from the perspective of the system. UX property of an LMS and functionality
of an LMS thus are highly related concepts, but with very slight differences in what
they represent. Furthermore, the topic is complicated with the nature of UX that is
fuzzy and has multiple highly interrelated concepts. This is an attempt at trying to
distinguish elements of a UX at a more granular level. The difference in
understanding between UX property and functionality of an LMS may be seen in
Figure 26 below, which is based on the developed inductively conceptual model.
This continues the idea that, as a result of methodology employing semi-structured
questions developed based on a holistic UX model, users tend to mention the same
topics from different perspectives across different questions. In this case, users tend
to mention the functionality of an LMS in addition to other elements at different
levels of a UX of an LMS in the same question.
Figure 26. Visualization of what the UX properties measure in the developed
conceptual model of UX of an LMS.

89

Depends on teachers (i.e., LMS Content Managers)

As frequently mentioned, students state that from their opinions, the use of an LMS
in many ways depending on how teachers use an LMS and how they structure the
content. Thus, it may be best to characterize such role of the teachers as content
managers of an LMS. The role of the content manager of an LMS was considered to
be highly crucial by many of the respondents in many of the responses. LMS itself
was then considered to be a “blank tool” that could be used properly or improperly.
Hence, the impact of teachers as content managers is sometimes detrimental to the
UX of an LMS. It is important to mention that teachers are both content managers of
an LMS, and users of an LMS (albeit, from a different than student’s perspective).
Teachers that use an LMS may also be represented as being a part of a community
of users, as it was frequently mentioned by the students who interacted with
teachers over an LMS. Content managers of an LMS may have different tasks at hand,
which are devoted to planning, creating, organizing, structuring, and managing the
content of an LMS.
Other Web-Platforms

Additionally, often UX of an LMS was perceived in the context of other webplatforms. These web-platforms were used with different intentions in mind. Thus,
other web-platforms had different roles. Some web-platforms were used instead of
some features of an LMS, such as WhatsApp or e-mails instead of discussion forums
(“replacing role”). Some were used complimentarily with some of the features of an
LMS, for example, links to the lectures hosted on YouTube (“complementary role”).
Others were compensating for some of the lacking features of Moodle, such as Slack
or Google Drive, in co-editing school assignments (“compensatory role”). In all of
these cases, the use of the LMS and other web-platforms changed; thus, it could be
said that UX of both LMS and other web-platforms have affected each other.

5 Discussion and Conclusions
Discussions and Conclusions is the final part of contemporary research. In this part,
answers to the research questions from data analysis results are discussed. Practical
implications are drawn as a result of the answers to the research questions.
Consequently, the results are also assessed in relation to existing research.
Limitations of the research are drawn and discussed. Finally, recommendations for
future research are given.
5.1.

Answers to the research questions

RQ1: What is the UX of the students, who use Moodle LMS of Åbo Akademi University?
Moodle is considered to be useful and easy to use study-related tool, which provides
multiple features, although not all of which are used. Many students stated that their
learning in the university is very dependent on Moodle, particularly in the
programmes where courses are predominantly online. However, the use of Moodle
was limited for some students, who claimed that they preferred traditional learning
to e-learning over Moodle. Generally, Moodle is not viewed as an entertaining or
enjoyful platform and should be considered different from a platform like YouTube.
UX of Moodle is variable for different students. Additionally, social context and use
by others are essential factors in the UX of Moodle. However, communication
features were weakly satisfying. UI of Moodle was described as clear and good
enough for the studying tool, but not very attractive. Other platforms were
responsible for impacting UX of Moodle: YouTube, e-mail, Google Drive, WhatsApp,
Facebook. These platforms were either replacing, complimenting, or compensating
certain UX elements of an LMS. Additionally, how teachers used Moodle was
considered to be among the most influential factors in the UX of students. There
were multiple improvement ideas of UX suggested by the students, often in the
context of what they did not like about Moodle. It may be possible to discuss how to
improve the UX of Moodle based on the collected feedback from the users. The areas
for improvement concern features of Moodle, UI of Moodle, communication over
Moodle, and the use of Moodle by the teachers. The latter two were considered to
be more critical issues than the former two.
To begin with, multiple students were not aware of the existence of many features,
sometimes even not aware of the features, which were proposed to be implemented
in Moodle, like group chat function. Students could be informed by training
programmes or by popup windows in the UI, as proposed by one student. Multiple
students suggested improving the content presented on Moodle by making it more
interactive, engaging, and visually appealing. Some students outlined issues with
navigation, mainly in the area of enrolling in and navigating between courses.
Additionally, students suggested improving the visual appeal of UI of Moodle by
making UI more colourful, while maintaining the already-present clearness and
simplicity. However, UI was not found to be an important priority, and thus it is
suggested to spend resources to focus on improving other issues first. It is advised
to keep in mind that other web-platforms were found to have an impact on the UX
of Moodle and to try integrating the three different roles of these web-platforms in
the overall use of Moodle. Designers of Moodle are best advised to keep an eye on

91

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

the web-platforms, which are replacing or compensating something in the use of
Moodle since these show that something is lacking in the UX of Moodle (e.g., instant
messaging).
It is strongly advised that universities consider issues over how to manage LMS in
terms of published content, given that content is a significant impact in the UX of
LMS, and as such, a significant impact in students’ e-learning, which is a part of
students’ learning in the university in general. Many students found that Moodle is
just a “blank slate” tool in many of the UX properties, with UX depending on how
that tool is used. Since teachers have a great impact on the UX of LMS, it is suggested
that teachers are informed on that. Additionally, many students stated that some
teachers create course content that is more interesting than other teachers. Thus, it
is highly proposed that special initiatives are taken to improve teachers’ abilities to
use LMS and to structure the content in an engaging way. Furthermore, it is advised
to inform the teachers on their role as facilitators of the discussion over LMS, with
many students stating that teachers have the power to increase students’
engagement in the discussion over Moodle. An example of such an initiative could
be to organize training programmes for the teachers, where they are taught how to
structure the course content in a more engaging way. Another example could be to
suggest the administration of the university to promote communities of practice of
the teachers around using Moodle. Finally, it may be suggested that the university
has personnel dedicated to maintaining and improving the quality of content over
Moodle through helping teachers structuring the content of their courses.
Many students suggested improving communication on Moodle by modernizing
discussion forum mechanisms, implementing private messages, chat function,
group communication. Interestingly, many students stated that in principle, there
are possibilities for proper communication over Moodle, but which are not widely
used. Teachers were found to have a great impact on the engagement in
communication over Moodle. Thus, it is suggested that teachers engage students in
interesting, engaging discussions. For example, teachers should provide alternatives
to “state a fact” type of discussion in assignments, which were described as boring
and shallow. Some students stated that they liked using discussion forums if the
discussion is personally relevant, for example, in their careers. Hence, as an
example, it may be advised that teachers facilitate a discussion over LMS that
facilitates students’ career perspectives. However, each situation is unique, and thus
teachers are advised to look into methods to create more personally engaging
discussions.
Also, advertised UX and actual UX may differ significantly. Moodle (2019), on its
official website, characterizes its interface as “modern and easy to use, easy to
navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.” Even though many users commented
that it is user-friendly for the most part, there were some issues outlined. Adding
new courses and sometimes navigating in the content between different courses
was challenging for some users. Furthermore, the mobile version was not very
comfortable to work with for many users in addition to complaints of the users
regarding the mobile app of Moodle. As such, the UX that was proposed by the
Moodle on its official website and the reported UX by the users differ. The extent to

92

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

which the UX is different is not clear, as well as the potential causes for the
difference.
RQ2: Are there any gender differences among the students in the UX of Moodle LMS?
Contemporary research stops short of making strong claims regarding RQ2, but the
research could give some suggestions, due to the qualitative, rather than
quantitative research approach. The evidence provided in the research shows that
there are no major differences in the UX of Moodle LMS across the two genders. For
the most part, the UX is similar across the two genders, with insignificant differences
across the two genders, but there are certain suggestions in the results; how a UX
that could be different. Quantitatively on average, UX does not differ between the
genders. Both genders were found to give equally inconsistent answers at about
70% consistency rate. However, men were less variant in the UX than women – men
were more likely to have somewhat good UX, but women were likely to have a wider
specter of UX. Based on the quantified qualitative data of the number of respondents
mentioning certain topics, for the most part, UX does not differ across the two
genders.
There are 10 topics (or 3% of total) that are more mentioned by one gender than by
another. According to the most mentioned topics by the two genders, it may be
concluded that females may be more oriented towards the holistic, somewhat
harmonic use of Moodle (how it is used by others, by the teacher, how attractive it
is), whereas males tended to view Moodle in more practical, functional, goaloriented terms (not focusing on attractiveness, evaluating functionalities of Moodle
for their ability to provide effective communication to perform tasks, such as
learning). Curiously, 90% of topics had a difference of only up to 2 members
between the genders. However, 90% of the topics were mentioned by at least one
more respondent of one gender than another.
A sort of shade or tone that may potentially exist in the UX between the genders (one
gender being slightly more focused on certain topics than the other). The result is
that UX of an LMS shall be considered more or less similar without any significant
differences between the genders. However, there are some minor differences in
general, which may be even more pronounced in a limited number of areas.
Referring to a metaphor, UX of an LMS was not found to be as a simple dinner table,
with one common flat surface. Rather, the UX is more like an office table, which has
one large flat working surface, but with some additional surfaces above the table
(e.g., for the computer screen) and below the table (e.g., the drawer). The large flat
surface represents the common part of UX to both genders, whereas additional
surfaces of the office table shall represent nuances in the UX of an LMS for the two
genders. The large working flat surface is the main part of the office table, which is
used for working with the documents, or with the computer. The surface above the
table may be used for placing a monitor but not suited for storing documents.
Drawer’s surface could be used for storing documents but could not really be used
for holding a PC monitor. Similarly, the UX of an LMS is similar for the two genders
for the good chunk of it. However, there are possibly certain parts of a UX that may
differ across the two genders.

93

RQ3: Is the holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019) applicable for analyzing the
UX of an LMS?
The researcher has found that the questionnaire used in the research by Topolewski
et al. (2019) based on the holistic UX model of Pallot et al. (2014) may not be very
accurate, but it may serve as a stepping-stone for the research of a UX of an LMS.
Semi-structured questions in the mixed methodology of contemporary research
were helpful at evaluating multiple aspects of a UX of an LMS at different levels. As
such, the questionnaire used in contemporary research may be considered as a tool
that allows conceptualizing the space of the UX of an LMS broadly at different levels.
Additionally, if semi-structured questions are supplemented with additional
questions, “What would you like to improve in this UX property?”, then it is possible
to form an understanding of how students would have liked to improve their UX of
an LMS.
However, the diversity of topics mentioned by the respondents in semi-structured
interviews was found to be better categorized through other categories than those
in the holistic UX model. As a result, the researcher has proposed a model that
consists of different elements. The elements or categories are UI/Layout, features,
uses, and functionalities of an LMS that help to satisfy the users’ needs. These
categories make up the usability of an LMS, which is an integral part of UX.
Furthermore, questions asking to evaluate UX properties also touched on other
platforms, users’ emotional and cognitive spaces, the community surrounding the
user, organizational context, and teachers as content managers of an LMS.
Additionally, it must be mentioned that there are certain questions in the holistic UX
model that focus on the topics, which are not mentioned in other questions. For
example, the novelty of Moodle is found to be discussed only in one question that
asks to rate the novelty. This is contrary to the discussion forums, which were
mentioned
when
discussing
user-friendliness,
comprehensiveness,
collaborativeness, communicativeness. Certain questions were more functional
than others. For example, the types of uses of Moodle could be noticed in the
questions regarding the usefulness, whereas more abstract feeling aspects were
represented in other questions, such as in the question regarding pleasantness of
use. This may speak of some questions being more generic that may have more
potential topics discussed than other questions. It may also characterize the holistic
UX model as having more questions aimed at evaluating certain aspects than
towards others.
As a result, the researcher concludes that UX of an LMS may be evaluated in greater
detail with the use of the devised conceptual model since it allows to distinguish
between the different elements of a UX of an LMS better than the holistic UX model.
The resulting conceptual model of a UX of an LMS may be used to help orient oneself
when discussing the fuzzy UX of an LMS, as well as potential differences between
users of different properties, such as gender. Additionally, respondents are
evaluating quantitatively the UX properties rather than individual elements; hence
even if the researcher through a significant time expenditure is able to analyze
different categories by qualitative coding, it is impossible to compare these
qualitative insights with the quantitative evaluations of the individual elements.

94

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

While it is possible to target specific elements of an LMS (i.e., more like a “sniper”
approach), semi-structured questions of a holistic UX model target much broader
areas (i.e., more like a “shotgun” approach). Thus, the holistic UX model may be good
at analyzing broad areas of a UX but may not be particularly good at targeting
specific elements of a UX, for which the proposed model may be better suited.
Furthermore, mixed methods research was found to provide richer data and
potential for drawing conclusions than the qualitative research only. Richer data
comes from being able to analyze the consistency of the quantitative and qualitative
answers, as well as being able to verify the researcher’s understanding of the
respondents’ interviews through comparing the codes with the quantitative
evaluations. At the same time, the cost of collecting additional quantitative data is
very low in terms of asking respondents to spend about five additional minutes for
filling in the quantitative survey in addition to the semi-structured interview.
However, there is a potential for a drawback in the contemporary mixed methods of
having to expend higher resources, such as time devoted to data analysis on a larger
dataset (such as sample size of 100 or over), if compared with purely quantitative
methodology. Depending on the research question, the collection of qualitative data
may be unnecessary for quantitative studies, where the purpose is, for example, to
compare the difference between the two populations across pre-defined
parameters. As such, mixed methods are proposed as preferable to the purely
qualitative methodology based on semi-structured interviewing when evaluating a
holistic UX of an LMS. However, the researcher stops short of proposing the mixed
methodology for analyzing UX of other IS than LMS, let alone other products.
Furthermore, some purely qualitative methods, such as based on unstructured
interviewing may provide data that could not be covered by the proposed mixed
methodology.
5.2.

Practical Implications

As Sanders (2002) states, the researcher in the User-Centered Design collects
primary data or uses secondary data to learn about the needs of the user, with the
consequent interpretation of the information, which is then proceeded to the
designer of the product. Due to the pragmatism research stance, contemporary
research may be treated as an interpretation report of the information about the
needs of the user. Designers of Moodle LMS may rely on the report in the data
analysis part to focus on any of the specific UX elements. Particularly, the focus must
be on the UI, communication features, use of Moodle with other web-platforms, as
well as learnability of Moodle by students. Teachers and administration of
universities, in general, may be advised to take an active, somewhat more
centralized approach to manage the UX of LMS, given that this may have a
detrimental impact on the e-learning of students. Furthermore, when designing LMS
or providing e-learning through it, gender shall be considered to be of minor
importance, although some areas (like visual appeal) may still be potentially
important for students of a different gender.
Answers to the third RQ are more directly applicable to provide advice in the
category of “how to do” rather than “what to do”, like in the first part of the practical
implications. Potentially, managers of LMS may be interested in applying the new

95

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

conceptual model in the data analysis summary. As it was discussed, the developed
model allows for a better understanding of the UX of an LMS in certain situations.
Arguably, a developed conceptual model may be better suited for focusing on a
specific aspect of a UX of an LMS. Another advice to the managers of an LMS may be
to use the methodology developed in this research to analyze the UX as a whole,
through the holistic UX model and the developed questionnaire. Hence, it could be
advised to use the holistic UX model to inquire participants for analyzing UX of an
LMS as a whole or try to utilize the developed conceptual model to focus on the
specific parts of an LMS, if the holistic UX is already known. A word of warning must
be given that the developed conceptual model of a UX of an LMS is not yet tested,
and there’s yet no developed questionnaire or methodology. Yet, one could utilize
the model for an understanding through visualized information on how different
elements of a UX of LMS are related to each other. It is potentially necessary that the
model is adapted to LMS and organization. However, it is unlikely that in the
university context, elements of the LMS would differ significantly from the Moodle
LMS in the Åbo Akademi University.
5.3.

Assessment of the results in relation to existing research

The findings of the contemporary study allow comparing the results with previous
studies. UX of an LMS may differ significantly across the different research. The realtime chat function is mentioned to be available in Moodle, enabling participants to
have a real-time synchronous discussion in a Moodle course (Cavus & Zabadi, 2014).
Multiple students in contemporary research have found the chat function in Moodle
to be absent or lacking development for satisfying use. Findings may be
contradicting previous research due to the potential variability in the versions of
Moodle across time and across universities. As such, it is proposed that the findings
of this research are highly contextualized to the use at Åbo Akademi University and
may not be directly extrapolated to other contexts and uses of Moodle systems in
other universities. In other words, UX depends on how universities design and
maintain Moodle. If Moodle is designed by good professionals, then the UX is good.
If Moodle is designed by amateurs and maintained improperly (e.g., hosted on bad
servers), then UX would suffer. Furthermore, Lamichhane et al. (2019) state that if
users are evaluating different LMSs, then because of having something to compare
with, evaluations may change. Contemporary study confirms this, given that some
users evaluated Moodle’s UX in relation to the LMSs that were used before.
Nakamura et al. (2017a) state that according to the performed systematic literature
review, none of the research in usability and UX of LMSs proposed solutions to the
identified issues in usability and UX of studied LMS. Contemporary research has
addressed this gap by proposing potential solutions to the identified issues in the
UX of studied LMS. It was possible to do so due to the pragmatic research stance and
user-centered design research approach, which also allowed to acquire ideas for
improving UX from the users of LMS.
Literature regarding gender differences in the UX of an LMS differs across the
existing literature, as it was previously mentioned. To remind, González-Gómez et
al. (2012) state that there are few differences between male and female students in
their use of e-learning and their motivation and satisfaction. Aufderhaar et al. (2019,
p. 66) claim that gender difference has no significant impact on the typical UX factors

96

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

of different website designs. Simon (2000, p. 18) concludes that the perception and
satisfaction of the website may differ within cultural clusters and gender groups.
The contemporary study has found little evidence to confirm significant gender
differences in the UX of Moodle on average. Nevertheless, there were differences in
the variability of evaluating UX of Moodle. Men were more likely to have between
somewhat good and acceptable UX, whereas women were having between good and
somewhat bad UX. Furthermore, there might be a slight difference in the focus when
evaluating UX. Females may be more attentive to the communication nuances with
others when using Moodle. More males mentioned the functionality of Moodle to
serve as a tool to provide information. However, this shall be considered as a
suggestion for the existence of such gender difference (due to the limitations of the
qualitative methodology) and shall be explored further in other research.
Additionally, both men and women were likely to give inconsistent (qualitative to
quantitative) answers when evaluating UX.
Potentially the main assessment comes as a result of evaluating how well the
assembled methodology based on the literature review is able to explore, analyze,
and explain UX of an LMS. As it was stated in the answers to the RQs, the
contemporary study utilized verified quantitatively holistic UX model by
Topolewski et al. (2019), based on the holistic UX model by Pallot et al. (2014). The
difference comes in the study context – while Topolewski et al. (2019) verified UX
of a feedback-collecting app Jaxber, which is a different Information System than the
LMS Moodle. The contemporary study has found that the model was useful in
exploring the UX of an LMS when utilizing a qualitative-driven mixed methods
approach. However, the holistic UX model by Topolewski et al. (2019) analyzed UX
somewhat too much broadly. Thus, a new conceptual model of a UX of an LMS is
proposed in the contemporary study, which may increase the accuracy of
evaluations by allowing to focus more narrowly on certain elements of a UX of an
LMS. Furthermore, proposed answer inconsistency typology in mixed methods by
Krawczyk et al. (2019), which attempts at filtering out in a mixed methods study of
UX of an IS by removing answers that have qualitative to quantitative inconsistency,
was somewhat confirmed in terms of its under- or over-valued answers. At least in
that regard, the typology was proven useful at the stage of verification of the results,
which has helped to somehow establish the reliability and validity of the data.
5.4.

Limitations of the research

As shown in the verification of the results, which is based on the Total Survey Error
(TSE), there are multiple potential sources of error, which shall be discussed in the
limitations of the contemporary research. Limitations of the research could be
classified in several general areas, which are interrelated. Researcher, who is also in
the role of interviewer, methodology devised by the researcher, and data analysis’
ability to generate reliable and valid results are one of the potential sources of bias.
The context of the research is another potential source of bias. The sample size and
interviewers are other sources of bias.

97

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Researcher/Methodology/Data Analysis

The first potential source of bias comes from the researcher (who is simultaneously
an interviewer and data analyst), methodology, or data analysis. Setia (2016) states
that in a cross-sectional study, it may be potentially difficult to establish reliable and
valid causal relationships. The study has the typical limitations of qualitative
interview studies (Yin, 2003). Although the researcher has done his best to collect,
document, and analyze the data as carefully as possible, it is possible that not all
meaningful findings were found. Hennig (2007) states that cluster analysis is done
in an exploratory manner, and the patterns found by cluster analysis are not
necessarily meaningful. A qualitative survey is the study of the diversity of member
characteristics within a population, in contrast to the statistical survey, which
analyzes frequencies in member characteristics (Jansen, 2010). Quantitative
surveying of the respondents may be better suited for looking for differences in the
frequency in populations (e.g., based on gender, age, study major, and so on). The
qualitative analysis could provide the basis for a variety of frequencies. In other
words, the qualitative analysis could help for answering the question, “where shall
the science look for the answer?” Contemporary research may provide some
suggestions where the gender difference in the UX of an LMS may be found, but the
research’s methodology could not confirm the extent of the presence of the gender
difference.
The established qualitative difference in terms of how many respondents
mentioned topics, and what is the gender differences may come from the potential
obscuration from the methodological limitations. Respondents may have been
biased by the researcher’s influence to answer in a certain manner. Informants may
also forget to bring up the topic, hence tweaking the total numbers of how many
respondents mentioned a certain topic. The researcher may not have noticed and
thus not encoded some of the topics in the NVivo. Finally, the topics may have been
mentioned across different questions and if summed up together – leading to
different total numbers of mentions by respondents.
It is important to outline the potential for the researcher’s bias in coding for
answers, and as such – in verifying the consistency between quantitative and
qualitative answers of respondents. As an example, one respondent has stated that
under certain conditions, she feels engaged. She said, “If there’s an assignment that
you have to hand in, then yes,” or answering if the teacher engages her, she
responded, “Yes. By providing material. Again, I do not know.” As such, the
respondent was coded that she evaluated felt “Engaged.” However, later at the stage
of verification of the results, quantitative marking was at score 2 (“Bad”) when
evaluating the engagement of Moodle. Arguably, the respondent might have been
coded as “Neutral” in terms of engagement if another coder was at work, and thus
the inconsistency might have been judged to be lower. Hence, verification of the
results must be viewed, considering that there are certain limitations that are
inherent in the qualitative methodology of the subjective bias of the researcher as a
coder.
The mere presence of the researcher could contribute to the bias of the respondents
behaving in a certain way, referred to as the “researcher bias” (Miyazaki and Taylor,
98

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

2008, p. 779-780). In addition to asking semi-structured questions, the researcher
has sometimes explained questions, gave metaphors, and asked additional
questions. Thus, the researcher may have impacted the degree to which certain
topics were mentioned more often than others. Some informants were asked at the
end whether it is easier for participants to understand and to answer the questions
when the quantitative survey is first with consequent semi-structured interviews or
vice versa. Respondents’ answers indicate that the order of data type collection
(quantitative or qualitative first) could have impacted the data in some way, such as
making it easier for some to understand and to answer the questions, thus
answering differently.
The holistic UX model, which forms the theoretical framework, is not widely used in
the context of evaluating UX of LMS. Thus, the theoretical framework may lack
validity and reliability. The proposed model of a UX of an LMS is entirely based on
the researcher’s understanding of interrelations of the elements that results from
data analysis and the review of the literature, and thus may require further
verification of the model, for example through the use of structural equation
modeling.
Context

Secondly, the research context should be considered as a potential source of bias for
the collected data and the study’s findings. Respondent surveying was
comprehended in a public space in two out of several university campuses: ASA or
Arken. Thus, some faculties might have been more present in the sample, which is
potentially represented in the sample: there are more people from business or
economics major (ASA campus) or liberal arts such as philosophy (Arken campus).
The area where the interviewing was taking place had a different environment –
sometimes noisy with many people passing by, sometimes silent with a few people
nearby. Occasionally there were other people sitting nearby the participants,
supposedly of their close social circle like study acquaintances, with a few times
when these people commented on something but were asked not to intervene for
the sake of not influencing the opinion of any given respondent, who was expected
to give feedback on the individual UX. Oftentimes, however, respondents were alone
when giving interviews. Respondents’ responses might have been influenced
depending on the context of interviews – by being distracted by the surrounding
noise, having a greater than normal pressure when pauses in the interview took
place from the surrounding silence, or by having to conform to the social pressure
in giving certain responses, among other potential bias. As a result, the data findings
may not be directly extrapolated to other Moodle versions, LMSs, or universities.
Interviewers/Sample

Finally, there are multiple limitations of the research stemming from the sample or
interviewers. Dixit et al. (2019, p. 31) state that principally, the problem of
convenience samplings is that there may be problems regarding the generalisability
of the results to the population. A small sample size (two sample groups of 10
respondents) might not be representative of a wider population of students at the
Åbo Akademi University. At the same time, albeit having a small sample size, Hwang
99

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

and Salvendy (2010) state that for usability evaluation of software products there
should be 8 to 12 respondents at the minimum, and thus the small sample size is
deemed sufficient to give at least the descriptive statistics of the samples. However,
Schmettow (2012) expressed certain doubts in the sufficiency of 8 to 12
respondents in usability studies, and hence these quantitative responses should be
viewed in conjunction with qualitative analysis. The response rate was roughly
70%, which may contribute towards non-response bias.
Before being interviewed, respondents were frequently busy doing some other
activity, with the most reported reason for not giving an interview by those who
rejected being survey that they do not have the time or that they have to focus on
studying. Thus, some respondents might not have been focused, giving not thoughtthrough answers during the surveying, or giving shallower responses. As a matter
of fact, one student said that she was in a hurry and did not think in-depth of the
answer when asked to comment why she had given a low quantitative scoring for
the questions relevant for the Intent to use, but mentioned that she is quite high on
the intent to use Moodle verbally.
Some of the respondents knew the interviewer before being approached with a
request to survey them or potentially saw the researcher on the public premises.
Hence, some respondents might have been influenced by different social roles in the
interactions with the interviewer, other than the role of an interviewee.
Respondents who knew the researcher were noticed to give somehow more
elaborate, more prolonged answers (such as one respondent, who gave almost an
hour-long interview) than those respondents who did not know the researcher.
Some respondents repeated their answers to different questions. It may be that the
same answer might have suited similar semi-structured questions. It may also
potentially show the lack of thought that some respondents gave when answering
the questions. Social, cultural, age impacts that could also be affecting the UX of LMS.
Thus, answers to the research regarding gender differences may not be valid.
Sanders (2002) has stated that there are certain levels of understanding of people’s
experiences, starting with explicit, how people say, going deeper into how people
feel, and what they dream of. Contemporary research is primarily concerned with
the explicit (surficial) and, to a certain extent, observable needs of the users of an
LMS, according to Sanders’ (2002) conceptualization. Thus, more profound
experiences may have been stayed untouched as part of this research, and the
findings may be based on incomplete data of the peoples’ experiences. Interviewers
themselves rarely expressed their emotions and feelings when giving answers.
Mostly, informants have expressed how they use products, rather than how they feel
during the use. As such, the analysis may be based on the data that lacks an
important part of the UX.
Additionally, Hsee and Hastie (2006) state that memory introduces systematic bias
into the evaluations, and as concluded by Norman (2009), many users could not
remember all the details of their experiences when asked to evaluate these
experiences after using the product. As such, the methodology of the contemporary
study based frequently on the post-factum evaluation of the use of LMS may not be
an accurate representation of the UX in the moment of the actual use of an LMS.

100

I. Maslov: Master’s Thesis in Governance of Digitalization.

Additionally, some respondents might have used Moodle not long before giving an
interview as compared to other students, which might have introduced additional
bias to the results of this study of the variability of the UX.
The researcher found an inconsistency in the answers of the respondents between
qualitative evaluations and the quantitative scores given in the surveys. Verification
of the results contains an analysis of the extent to which the answers were
inconsistent. About 70% of the answers are consistent. Hence, results may not be
reliable or valid due to the inconsistency, which may come from interviewees’ lack
of understanding, willingness, or capability to give meaningful answers into their
actual UX. There are some potential explanations for that. First is that the order of
questions might have influenced the answers, which might also be an explanation
for inconsistencies between the quantitative scores and the qualitative evaluation
of the same UX attributes. For example, one respondent, when caught with such
inconsistency and inquired for the reasons of why that was happening, recollected
that after “thinking about questions,” the opinion has changed. Another potential
explanation is that respondents were not giving thoughtful comments (one student
said that she was in a hurry and that might have affected her quantitative scores,
which she has proposed to increase at the end of semi-structured interview).

Recommendations for future research

There are multiple recommendations and suggestions for future research.
Recommendations may be approximately divided into methodology-related and
concept-related. The former suggest improving the reliability and validity of the
analysis of the existent issue by improving or using another methodology. Latter
suggest exploring with an existent or another methodology concepts that are based
on the findings of the contemporary study.
To begin with, future studies may improve the limitations of methodology.
Convenience sampling may be replaced with probability samplings, the sample size
may be increased, or there may be several coders of qualitative data to improve data
reliability and validity. Additionally, it might be of value to include in the survey at
the end whether it is easier for participants to understand and to answer the
questions when the quantitative survey is first with consequent semi-structured
interviews or vice versa. This may improve the understanding in the consequent
research whether the order of data type collection (quantitative or qualitative first)
could have impacted the data in a major way. Wordings of the questions could be
improved to improve an understanding of the questions by the respondents. Future
research may also attempt to verify that the questions used in this research are
actually measuring the concepts – for example, by asking respondents to review
whether the questionnaire actually evaluates the UX. Furthermore, the methodology
from the contemporary study may be replicated in another context to verify the
findings of this study.
The mixed method could be improved by taking a more proactive approach in trying
to locate inconsistencies in the data between quantitative scores and qualitative
scores, with the consequent inquiries of the informant to correct the response
(either quantitative or qualitative) so that there is a higher consistency in the

101

answers. Finding inconsistencies could be at the stage of interviewing, or at the
stage of data analysis when it is possible to analyze transcribed data in the context
of quantitative scores. As a result, informants could be approached later to correct
inconsistent data. Thus, data could potentially become more valid and reliable. The
effect of bias (e.g., because of unthoughtful answers to the survey’s question or
because of better reflection) could be monitored and, at the very least, outlined more
clearly.
Future research may want to utilize a different methodology to explore the same
issue. Contemporary research relies on a qualitative-driven mixed methodology.
Hence, for example, it may be advised that a quantitative-driven mixed methodology
could be employed. The quantitative methodology may also be used to verify some
of the findings, such as verifying, whether there are gender differences in the UX of
an LMS. It is also possible to advise future research to explore based on the findings
of this study. Additionally, emotions and feelings are considered being a major part
of UX. However, interviewers rarely expressed their emotions when giving answers
to how they use the LMS. Future research may try to take that into account. For
example, by providing a survey that asks to name the emotions that were felt, or by
asking respondents in the interview how they felt using LMS.
Continuing with concept-related recommendations for future research, developed
in this study conceptual model of a UX of LMS, may be explored and verified. There
are different elements that may potentially influence the UX of an LMS. Thus, the
research may focus on specific elements (such as the impact of other web-platforms
on the UX) or developed the model as a whole. The difficulty to outline a specific list
of functionalities of an LMS is that the boundaries at that level of abstraction are
highly unclear. For example, as part of the inductive analysis in NVivo, the
researcher has established the functionality “socialization.” The researcher has
characterized this functionality as any sort of socializing activity that the users may
indulge in when using an LMS – be it through simple communication on discussion
forums with peer students or through the use of personal messaging to
communicate with the teacher. In the holistic UX model, there may be different
functionalities that aim at describing the same functionality – communicativeness,
collaborativeness, respectfulness, among some potential others. As a result, it may
be hard to define the functionalities, which are fuzzy and have unclear boundaries.
Further work may be required to establish boundaries between different
functionalities in the developed model.
Furthermore, the research was able to provide ideas where gender differences may
exist in the UX of an LMS, but not to show the extent of these differences. As such, a
study dedicated to analyzing the potential difference in the mechanisms of genders
evaluating their UX may be proposed. In particular, quantitative methodology with
random sampling is advised to be used. To devise the questions for the quantitative
survey, findings from this question or the developed quantitative questionnaire on
a 1-7 Likert scale may be used. In particular, a future study may focus on verifying
the existence of a more variant UX among females than among males, as well as
finding the reasons for it. Finally, future research is advised to analyze the impact of
students’ attributes other than gender, as a piece of evidence was found that
different study majors may have an impact on the UX of an LMS.
