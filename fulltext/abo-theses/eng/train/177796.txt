Title: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover
intentions
Supervisor: Professor Gunilla Widén

Abstract:
Digitalization and increasing knowledge work have set new conditions for working life. At
the same time as increasing networking, co-operation and workloads, there has also been
an increase in problems with coping, social functioning and mental burden related to
work. The purpose of this study is to improve managerial competence in IS/IT work. The
aim is to find recommendations for management to better affect ICT-employee
willingness to stay in company service. These recommendations can be seen as preventive
measures against voluntary turnover. To be able to form these guidelines, this research
intents to identify the factors that most increase and decrease ICT-professionals’ job
satisfaction in the workplace. A comprehensive literature review was performed to cover
concepts such as job satisfaction, motivation, commitment, turnover as well as
management of specifically knowledge organizations and the results were used as a basis
for the methodology choices of the empirical study. Data were collected through a survey
questionnaire which was distributed online, as well as structured interviews with ICTprofessionals. The results show that in the motivating factors lies big potential for the
employer to increase job satisfaction of these ICT-professionals. The results indicate that
by enhancing advancement possibilities and especially improving feedback from results
and giving more recognition for success, the employer can increase feelings of achievement
in the employee which not only affects positively on job satisfaction but also
empowers the employee and leads to feelings of responsibility. This is meaningful because
high levels of commitment and job satisfaction correlate with a willingness to stay in the
organization’s service. This, in turn, is in relation to corporate metrics, like productivity,
profit, customer satisfaction, employee turnover decrease, as well as the general health
and well-being of the workforce.

1 Introduction
1.1 Area of research
Finnish research on work well-being has a long and robust tradition and it is also
internationally respected. The focus in research has expanded from studying
traditional, physical conditions and their risks to studying mental burdening, the
social functioning of the work community, productivity in the workplace,
individual coping and work ability. This is because of the vigorous changes in
working life that have required more networking, co-operation, increasing
workloads and expectations, as well as globalization (Finnish Government, 2005).
Digitalization and increasing knowledge work have set new conditions for working,
work demands and work strain. We need new ways to increase work productivity,
safety and health. Data processing skills are essential in current and future working
life. This kind of work requires much from human brain. Workers need to observe,
multitask, remember, decide and solve. Information technology is our main tool. It
is of utmost importance to recognize what demands increasing knowledge work
actually sets and what disturbing factors there might be for these. Human data
processing capability has its species-related limits the same way as in physical
ability (Finnish Institute of Occupational health, 2020).
Statistics Finland has made work condition barometers that have shown several
negative long-term trends, including increased haste, mental burden and stress.
Positive development has happened with improved education levels of workers,
increased influencing possibilities in work and high general job satisfaction levels.
What have been highlighted recently are the problems related to psychosocial
work environment. This is due to competition that is becoming ever stronger in
the private sector and insufficient personnel in the public sector. Working
conditions also differ in relation to profession, education and skills, terms of one’s
contract and age. In addition, health risks are distributed unevenly. Work can
develop a person’s resources at its best, but be a health risk at its worst (Kinnunen,
Feldt & Mauno, 2005, p. 8-9).

According to Statistics Finland, digitalization has penetrated Finnish working life.
Based on their 2018 Quality of Work Life Survey, 90 per cent of wage and salary
earners use digital applications at work. The use of digital devices, personal digital
skills and personal experiences of how digitalization affects work are, however,
distributed unevenly (Statistics Finland, 2020).
Statistics Finland's above mentioned surveys describe changes in wage and salary
earners’ working conditions for over four decades, since 1977. The latest Quality of
Work Life Survey shows that “working life has developed positively in many
respects: for example, wage and salary earners’ views on the atmosphere in the
workplace, realization of gender equality and social relationships in the workplace
have improved clearly starting from 2008. Work engagement has increased. On the
other hand, problems with coping at work have clearly increased from 2013. These
problems are more common among women than men. Various physical and mental
symptoms have become more common, especially among young and middle-aged
wage and salary earners” (Statistics Finland, 2020).
However, Kinnunen et al. (2005) state that recent work psychology has started
concentrating on the positive. Instead of focusing only on pathological problems
and their reasons, psychologists have started placing more emphasis on studies
concerning well-being, health and preventive measures (Kinnunen, Feldt & Mauno,
2005, p. 56).
How we behave in working life, depends on both our will and ability. This thesis
examines the motivation part and tries to research employees’ inner thoughts that
indicate problem areas. The purpose of this thesis is to provide recommendations
for management to better affect ICT-employee’s willingness to stay in company
service. These recommendations can be seen as preventive measures against
voluntary turnover. To better understand the context of organizational behaviour,
the researcher will examine some key theories of employee motivation. Factors
affecting job satisfaction will also be addressed. Management should be expected
to be aware of these factors. According Kuoppala et al. (2008) good leadership
seems to improve job satisfaction and job well-being as well as decrease sickness

absenteeism and disability pensions. The relationship between leadership and job
performance, however, remains unclear. Effects of psychosocial work factors on
health are mediated through the organizational structure and function. One of the
important modifying factors between organizational factors and health is
supervisory leadership. Kuoppala et al. (2008) state that it most likely affects not
only the productivity and effectiveness of an organization but also the health and
well-being of employees. The best way to affect health problems is from levels of
leadership, work environment, and working conditions (Kuoppala et al., 2008).
As digitalization is only accelerating, we can neither turn back time nor stop
development (nor do we want this), but we can rationally govern and harness
these processes. More importantly, we can actively guide them in the desired
direction and this starts by being aware of organizations’ and individuals’ current
state.

1.2 Overall aim of the thesis and research questions
The overall aim in this thesis is to improve managerial competence in IS/IT work,
but also secondarily to contribute to improving general work well-being from an
individual’s perspective, especially in knowledge work. The objective is to shift the
attention back to the individual doing the work. The employer should consider
employee needs when setting the conditions for work. It is also a value choice in
itself to focus on the individual. Without individuals, there would be no collective
work done either. More importantly, workers are more than mere resources. In this
aspect also organizational values will be researched. Values affect the way matters
are actually conducted in an organization.
The objective of this thesis is obtained by first identifying the most relevant factors
for job satisfaction through a literature review. As this topic is cross-disciplinary,
the researcher will derive from psychology, human resources and leadership
studies as well. The specific features of knowledge work and its management are
described. These insights have then been used to design the empirical study.

Through the quantitative and qualitative data collection and data analysis, the
researcher attempts to provide recommendations for improving managerial
competence in IS/IT work contributing to the wellbeing of individuals.
With this in mind, the research questions are posited as follows:
RQ1: What factors decrease ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction in the workplace
the most?
RQ2: What factors increase ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction in the workplace the
most?
RQ3: What can the employer do to support ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction?
These questions will first help to understand, what the influencing factors of
specifically ICT-related knowledge workers’ job satisfaction are (describing a
phenomenon) and secondly, to perceive what the participating ICT-professionals
suggest could be improved by their employers and use this knowledge to form
guidelines (developing good practice). The researcher wishes to attain some
concrete measures for the latter objective. The study will be conducted with a
mixed methods of both quantitative and qualitative nature.

1.3 Structure of the thesis
This thesis begins by introducing the topic and emphasizing the importance of this
kind of research. The second and third chapter of the thesis are the literature
review which provide an overview to the topic and context in which knowledge
workers and the research participants of this study work in. It will clarify the
realities of the current society and knowledge work environment, as well as the
realities of people as psychological-physiological-social beings. Here are taken into
account motivating factors that are general to all people as well as occupationspecific features. These are followed by theoretical backgrounds that set the
framework for actual research.

In chapter four, the methodology used in this research will be explained.
The data collection method as well as the data analysis method will be discussed.
The actual empirical framework will be introduced. Study object is presented and
the empirical study process reviewed. Chapter five discusses the analysis and
interpretation of results. Main findings are presented.
Chapter six focuses on discussion of the results of this study and their reflecting on
the literature. This is followed by the final conclusions where the researcher
attempts to provide answers to the research questions. Additionally, theoretical
contributions and practical implications are discussed. Limitations are
acknowledged and proposals for future research suggested.

2 Work well-being, job satisfaction and motivation

2.1 Definition of work well-being and job satisfaction

According to Finnish Institute of Occupational health (FIOH), well-being at work
means safe, healthy and productive work that professionally skilled workers and
work communities do in a well-managed organization. Professionals and
communities regard their work meaningful and rewarding and supportive to their
life control. Well-being at work is the joint responsibility of both employee and
employer. It is an investment that can pay back several times greater than what
was invested. FIOH further states that according to research, well-being at work
has a significant relation to corporate metrics like productivity, profit, customer
satisfaction, employee turnover decrease, sick leaves and injuries (Finnish Institute
of Occupational health, 2020).
According to International Labour Organization, “workplace well-being relates to
all aspects of working life, from the quality and safety of the physical environment,
to how workers feel about their work, their working environment, the climate at
work and work organization. The aim of measures for workplace well-being is to
complement occupational safety and health measures to make sure workers are
safe, healthy, satisfied and engaged at work. Workers’ well-being is a key factor in
determining an organization's long-term effectiveness. Many studies show a direct
link between productivity levels and the general health and well-being of the
workforce” (ILO, 2019).
Job satisfaction is one essential part of overall well-being at work. It is an
attitudinal variable that reflects how people feel about their jobs overall, as well as
various aspects of the jobs. Job satisfaction can be described as the extent to which
people like their jobs (global satisfaction) or aspects of their jobs (facet
satisfaction) (Spector, 2012, p. 216).
According to Spector, many prior studies have shown that job satisfaction levels
are not the same across countries. Scandinavian countries have been ranked high
among these surveys. The surveys do not however shed much light on the reasons

10

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

for different feelings about work in different countries. One explanation are
cultural values that some scholars have assessed (e.g. Hofstede, 2001). These
cultural values are: (1) individualism/collectivism, (2) masculinity, (3) power
distance and (4) uncertainty avoidance (Spector, 2012, p. 218).
It is noteworthy, that as digitalization has changed the ways of working and living,
mental disorders (F-diagnoses) have increased their portion as a cause for sick
leaves and disability pensions in Finland. The real reason behind the sick leave is
often exhaustion even if the person is away because of a physical symptom.
Finnish occupational health psychologists state that today the health threats of
working life are more often psychological and social of character and for example
recognizing change as burdening and how to control it, is still in early steps. One
way to develop Finnish occupational health law could be a compulsory workload
investigation, which is now rarely done (Teikari & Karas, 2020).
Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has produced a web site for managers and
supervisors called Hyvän mielen työpaikka, to act as a tool for supporting mental
working ability of personnel (FIOH, 2020). Indeed, this appears to be one of the
management’s biggest concerns in Information Age. When beginning to examine
the organization from a mental perspective, we have to however start from
defining organizational behavior. Organizational behavior means behavior of
individuals and of groups in organizations (Lämsä & Hautala, 2004). Attitudes
toward work can be used for measuring organizational behavior in the workplace.

2.2 Organizational behavior and organizational culture
Organizational behavior is the study of the structure, functioning and performance
of organizations and the behavior of groups and individuals within them
(Huczynski & Buchanan 2007). According to Armstrong and Taylor, organizational
behaviour theory is based on the main behavioural science disciplines. These
fields, that study human behavior, include psychology, social psychology and
sociology (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).

11

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Organizational culture can be described as “the way we do things around here”. It
is however more complex than just that. Organizational culture consists of shared
meanings that act as a basis for communications and mutual understanding
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014). Values, norms, beliefs, attitudes and assumptions all
affect organizational culture. This culture affects how people behave.
Organizational culture can be described with values, norms, artefacts and
management or leadership style (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Values are beliefs of what’s best for the organization or what should happen. They
are either expressed spoken out or implicit. What matters is are they embedded in
the culture and reinforced by managerial behavior. If they are not used then they
have no effect (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014). The task for managers is to clarify their
values so that they “form a coherent pattern that fits the needs and the orientation
of the organization and society as a whole. Unlike the more innate factors that
influence management style, values are learned and determined by culture and by
social institutions” (Benfari, 2013).
Norms are unwritten rules of behavior telling people what they are supposed to be
doing, saying etc. They can be enforced by the reactions of co-workers. They guide
silently the behavior but they are never spoken out (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Artefacts are visible and tangible aspects of the organization that tell a lot about
the culture. They can include working environment, language and tone used in emails, letters and telephone, how welcoming the company is to visitors etc. All of
these are revealing in part (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Management styles are a significant part of organizational cultures. They mean the
style the manager uses to deal with people. It is usually described as charismatic vs.
non-charismatic, autocratic vs. democratic, controller vs. enabler and transactional
vs. transformational. Most managers are somewhere in between these extremes. It
can also be dependent of the situation. But anyhow it affects the organizational
culture. A certain style may even become as a norm of behavior in the company
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014). According to Benfari (2013),

12

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

understanding of management style begins with understanding human nature.
“For managers and leaders, the rational and humane approach is to understand
and accept the reality of different psychological types. Conflicts that emerge from a
clash between psychological types can be turned into a positive force if managers
understand how to balance roles and responsibilities to play to everyone’s
strengths” (Benfari, 2013).

2.3 Motivation
Motivation as a subject has been extensively researched since the early 20th
century. According to Armstrong and Taylor (2014), motivation theories have
been used and are still being used to inform decisions on how to get employees to
perform better. Motivation is a close term to commitment and engagement but
they do not mean the exact same thing. Motivation is “the force that energizes,
directs and sustains behavior”. The term motivation comes from the Latin word for
movement (movere) (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Arnold et al. (1991) have described three components for motivation. These are
(1) direction – what a person is trying to do, (2) effort – how hard a person is
trying and (3) persistence – how long a person keeps on trying (Armstrong &
Taylor, 2014). Spector describes that motivation is concerned with a desire to
achieve some goal; that it derives from what a person wants or needs (Spector,
2012).
2.3.1 Intrinsic motivation
There are two types of motivation. Intrinsic motivation happens when individuals
feel that their work is important, interesting and challenging and that it provides
them with a reasonable degree of autonomy, opportunities to advance and
possibility to use and develop their skills. This motivation derives from the work
itself and is not created by external incentives. Intrinsic motivation can be
enhanced by job design (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p.170).

13

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

The job characteristics theory by Hackman and Oldham (1976, 1980) is probably
the most influential theory of how job characteristics affect people (Spector p. 31).
The main idea remains unchanged that people can be motivated by intrinsic
satisfaction they find in doing job tasks. Enjoyment and meaningfulness will lead to
motivation and people performing their jobs well. There are five core
characteristics of jobs that induce psychological states that in turn lead to job
performance, job satisfaction, motivation and turnover. These five core
characteristics are (1) skill variety (the number of different skills necessary to do a
job), (2) task identity (whether or not an employee does an entire job or a piece of
a job), (3) task significance (the impact a job has on other people), (4) autonomy
(the freedom employees have to do their jobs as they see fit) and (5) job feedback
(the extent to which it is obvious to employees that they are doing their jobs
correctly). The first three combined induce experienced meaningfulness of work.
Autonomy leads to feelings of responsibility. Feedback leads to knowledge of
results of the products of work. These three psychological states in turn contribute
to important outcomes of job satisfaction and motivation of employees (Spector,
1997, p. 31).
According to job characteristics theory, the above mentioned five core
characteristics determine how motivating a job is likely to be (Spector, 1997).
Motivation Potential Score (MPS) is then determined mathematically using
following formula:
MPS = (Skill variety + task identity + task significance) /3 x autonomy x feedback
The higher the score, the more motivating and satisfying the job will be, as can be
seen from the Figure 1. Also, job characteristics theory states that people who
prefer challenge and interest in their work will be happier and more motivated if
they have complex jobs. The theory includes Growth need strength (GNS) as a
moderator between the variables. The theory states that the motivating effects of
job satisfaction will only occur for individuals who are high on GNS (Spector, 1997,
p. 33-34).

2.3.2 Extrinsic motivation
Extrinsic motivation happens when things are done to or for people in order to
motivate them. These can be rewards like incentives, increased pay, praise or
promotion or punishments like disciplinary action, withhold pay or criticism. The
difference between these two types of motivation is that even if extrinsic
motivators can have a powerful and immediate effect, they do not last very long,
whereas intrinsic motivators are likely to have deeper and long-term effect
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p. 171).

2.4 Motivation theories
According to Spector, work motivation theories are usually concerned with the
reasons, other than ability, why some people perform their jobs better than others.
If we presume that employees have the necessary ability and there are relatively
15

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

few constraints on performance, high motivation should lead to good job
performance (Spector, 2012, p. 194).
Motivation theories view employee motivation from different angles. Still, they do
not necessarily lead to different predictions about behavior. Motivation theories
can also be examined in a continuum from distal to proximal, where distal theories
are far removed from behavior and proximal theories study processes that are
close to behavior or can lead to a specific kind of behavior (Spector, 2012, p. 196).
2.4.1 Instrumentality theory
Instrumentality theory assumes that punishments and rewards are the best ways
to shape behavior. Taylor’s (1911) early scientific management method has
affected this theory, that states people will be motivated to work if rewards and
penalties are tied directly to their performance. This theory relies heavily on
external controls and fails to take into account other human needs (Armstrong &
Taylor, 2014).
2.4.2 Content or needs theories
The aim of needs theories by Maslow (1943), McClelland (1961), Herzberg (1968),
and Deci & Ryan (2000) was to identify the factors associated with motivation. The
basis of motivation is in needs. These theories believe that an unsatisfied need
creates tension and disequilibrium. The path for behavior is created to satisfy this
need and restore a state of balance. Earlier need theories have given way to more
cognitive evaluation processes in work psychology, but the researcher finds them
relevant to discuss in this study.
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist, wrote his theory of the hierarchy of
needs in 1943 for his paper A theory of human motivation. According to Maslow all
human motivation is generated from basic needs. The fulfillment of these is
necessary for physical and psychological health. He listed five basic needs:

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem (social needs) and self-actualization.
Later, he added yet transcendence. The most basic needs have to be satisfied
before a person will focus motivation on upper needs. The lowest level,
physiological needs, mean the physical necessities for survival, like air, food, water.
Second level, safety needs, mean needs for security and shelter. Third level, love
and belonging needs, mean need for love, affection, and affiliation with others.
Fourth, esteem needs, mean self-respect and respect of others. Fifth is selfactualization, in which a person desires to become everything a person is capable
of becoming, reaching one’s potential (Maslow, 1943, Spector, 2012, p. 196-197).
Maslow assumed that a need has to be unmet to be motivating and that people are
motivated by the lowest-level need that is unmet at the moment. Therefore, a
hungry person would not be concerned with danger and might steal food regardless
of the punishment. Maslow admitted however, that there are certain individuals
that find higher-order needs more important than lower-level ones but that this is
more of an exception. Many Western individuals seldom actually experience
deprivation of the first four needs and therefore the basic needs are not motivating
for them (Maslow, 1943; Spector, 2012, p. 197), see Figure 2.

Research on Maslow’s Need Hierarchy theory has not been very supportive, mainly
because it is so vague that it is hard to be tested reliably. Despite the lack of
empirical support, it has had a positive impact on organizations and it helps to focus
attention to the importance of employee needs (Spector, 2012, p. 197).
Alderfer’s ERG-theory
In Alderfer’s (1972) theory, three primary categories of needs are formulated: 1.
Existence needs (hunger, thirst, pay, fringe benefits or working conditions), 2.
Relatedness needs (acceptance, understanding, confirmation or influence) and 3.
Growth needs (becoming what you can) (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p. 173).
McClelland’s need theory
McClelland has developed a theory (in 1961), which is based on studies of
managers. McClelland wrote about three needs of which the need for achievement
is most important. The other two are the need for affiliation and the need for
power (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Herzberg’s two factor theory
Another important theory concerning job satisfaction, is psychologist Frederick
Herzberg’s two-factor theory (also known as motivation-hygiene theory, 1968). It
states that motivation comes from the nature of the job itself rather than from
external rewards or job conditions. The human needs that work addresses are
divided into two categories – those that derive from the animal nature of human
beings, such as the physiological needs, and those relating to the higher level and
uniquely human ability for psychological growth.
Those aspects that rise from animal needs are called hygiene factors, and they
include pay, supervision, coworkers and organizational policies. Those aspects that
rise from growth needs Herzberg calls motivator factors and these include
achievement, recognition, responsibility, and the work itself. Herzberg stated that

18

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

only way to motivate employees and make them feel satisfied is to handle properly
the motivator factors. Herzberg suggests job enrichment (Herzberg, 2003).
Hygiene factors cannot lead to motivation or satisfaction with work but if they are
poorly handled, they can lead to dissatisfaction (Spector, 2012, p. 197), see Figure
3.

Figure 3. Herzberg's two-factor theory

Self-determination theory by Deci & Ryan
Deci and Ryan (2000) state that individuals are motivated by the need to achieve
three fundamental goals: striving for competence, autonomy and relatedness
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).

2.4.3 Process theories
In process theories the focus is in psychological processes and forces that affect
motivation as well as on basic needs. Another term for it is cognitive theory
because it refers to workers’ perceptions of their environment. The main process

19

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

theories are interested in reinforcement, expectancy, goals, equity and cognitive
evaluation (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Reinforcement theory
This theory has been formulated already in 1911 by Thorndike. Reinforcement
theory states that people learn over time about their actions and the consequences
of them and this guides them in their future behavior. If they believe that something
has worked previously, they will do it again. This theory has been criticized for
forgetting the existing context in which choices are made.
Expectancy theory
According to expectancy theory, motivation will be high when a person knows
what to do in order to get a reward, expect that they will be able to get the reward
and expect that the reward will be worthwhile. Past experience is seen as an
inadequate guide to the implications of change of situations. Motivation is only
likely when a clearly perceived and usable relationship exists between
performance and outcome (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Goal-setting theory
One of the most used theories among organizational psychologists is the goalsetting theory (Locke & Latham, 1990). The theory states that people’s behavior is
motivated by their internal intentions, objectives or goals. A goal is seen as what a
person consciously wants to attain or achieve. People can be learning oriented or
performance oriented in their goal-setting. People will exert effort toward
accomplishing their goals and job performance is a function of the goals set.
Organizations have used goal-setting to maintain or increase job performance.
There are prerequisite factors for goal-setting to be effective in improving job
performance (Spector, 2012, p. 208).

20

|

Equity theory
Equity theory is a justice theory that states that people are motivated to achieve a
condition of fairness or equity in their dealings with other people and with
organizations. According to Adams (1965), employees who find themselves in
inequitable situations will be dissatisfied and emotionally tense, which they then
will be motivated to reduce. The term inequity refers to here to a psychological
state that arises from employees comparisons of themselves with others.
Outcomes are compared to inputs (Spector, 2012, p. 204).
Cognitive evaluation theory
Deci & Ryan (1985) have formulated the cognitive evaluation theory, in which
extrinsic rewards may destroy intrinsic motivation that comes from inherent job
interest. Their studies determined that context is very important when thinking
which motivator works. In high-control organizations, financial incentives actually
decreased intrinsic motivation, while in high-involvement organizations both
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation were increased by financial incentives
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p. 176).

2.5 Job satisfaction
Job satisfaction can be described as the attitudes and feelings people have about
their work. The levels of job satisfaction or dissatisfaction are influenced by: (1)
The intrinsic motivating factors (the job itself, Hackman and Oldham), (2) The
quality of supervision (The Hawthorne studies in 1939 stated that supervision is
the most important determinant of employee attitudes) and (3) Success or failure
(success obviously creates satisfaction and vice versa) (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014,
p. 177).

21

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

In the early stages of job satisfaction studies, need fulfillment theories were
dominating the field. These need approaches have however given way to more
cognitive-focused studies. Nowadays job satisfaction is understood as a positive
attitude towards the job, in which the affectionate elements are emphasized.
Individual is not working merely to satisfy or fulfill certain needs but also to
achieve goals that he/she has set himself/herself (Kinnunen et al., 2005, p. 60).

2.6 Motivation strategies
Motivation strategies are used “to create a working environment and to develop
policies and practices that will provide for higher levels of performance from
employees. They include the design of intrinsically motivating jobs and leadership
development programs and the development of total reward systems and
performance management processes.” (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p. 183).

3 Commitment, turnover and management of knowledge organizations
3.1 Commitment
Organizational commitment involves three things: (1) An acceptance of the
organization’s goals, (2) A willingness to work hard for the organization and (3)
The desire to stay with the organization. Meyer et al. have developed a threecomponent commitment perspective (1993). Affective commitment occurs when
the employee wishes to remain within the organization because of an emotional
attachment. Continuance commitment exists when a person must remain with the
organization because he/she needs the benefits and salary or cannot find another
acceptable job. Normative commitment comes from the values of the employee.
The person believes that he/she owes it to the organization to remain out of a
sense that this is the right thing to do (Spector, 2012, p. 235).
Meyer et al. have also developed an idea of occupational commitment. This means
commitment to your occupation or profession rather than a certain organization
(Spector, p. 239). This is often the case with ICT-professionals. ICT-professionals
are more loosely bound to their employer than to their own profession group. This
is related to the high turnover numbers among ICT-professionals. According to
research recruiting skilled workforce, developing, rewarding, and supporting
career development are important when luring ICT-professionals and in keeping
them in-house (Kleingartner & Anderson 1987, p. 129-130).
Work involvement means individual’s identification to his/her job, when the work
role becomes an integral part of his/her self-concept and life. General work
involvement is a relatively permanent attitude towards work. Specific job
involvement means committing to a certain job assignment and that is dependent
on how that assignment fulfills the needs of that individual. Career commitment
means more committing to one’s career and its development. Occupational
commitment plays a major role in career commitment. Organizational
commitment on the other hand means individual’s commitment to his/her work
organization (Kinnunen et. al, 2005, p. 64).

23

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Commitment tells about the feelings of employees about their organization. The
three characteristics of commitment studied by Mowday et al are: (1) a strong
desire to remain a member of the organization, (2) a strong belief in and
acceptance of the values and goals of the organization and (3) a readiness to exert
considerable effort on behalf of the organization. In studies employee commitment
has led to improved organizational performance (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Commitment can also be divided into five different dimensions as Morrow has
done (1993); work ethics, affective commitment, career commitment, continuance
commitment or commitment to the work itself (Viitala, 2008).
According to Armstrong and Taylor (2014), human resources department can
advance commitment with certain procedures. These key points include that
values and aims of management need to be communicated, management needs to
know that commitment is a two-way process and management has to develop a
climate of trust and a positive psychological contract (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p.
190).

3.1.1 Work engagement
A new term in work well-being is work engagement that is the opposite of burnout.
Maslach & Leiter (1997) have described work engagement to consist of employee’s
energy, involvement and efficacy experiences. Schaufeli (2002) on the other hand
has approached the term from another perspective, where burnout and engagement
are not opposite phenomenons but separate, and they cannot be measured on the
same method. Work engagement is according that, a rather permanent positive
emotion- and motivation state, which can be described with experience of vigor,
dedication and work absorption (Kinnunen et al., 2005).
According to Viitala, people sometimes speak of disengagement when they actually
mean turnover intentions. Engagement is a person’s psychological relationship to
the organization he/she works in, another term for this is psychological contract. If
24

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

this psychological contract is bad then the threshold to leave the company is
smaller (Viitala, 2008).
Engagement happens when employees are committed to their work and their
organization and they are motivated to strive for high performance. Armstrong
states interestingly that “(Reilly and Brown have noted that) the terms ‘job
satisfaction’, ‘motivation’ and ‘commitment’ are generally being replaced now in
business by ‘engagement’ because it appears to have more descriptive force and
face validity” (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).

3.1.2 Psychological contracts
A psychological contract can be described as “the perceptions of both parties to the
employment relationship, organization and individual, of the reciprocal promises
and obligations implied in that relationship” (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Rousseau (1989) has divided psychological contracts into two categories:
transactional psychological contracts and relational psychological contracts.
Transactional psychological contracts between the employee and the organization
remind of trade contracts because financial founding is essential in them. They
may be uncertain or short-termed and the main motivator for the employee is the
salary paid for work. Also the employer does not expect any other performance
than what has been agreed upon. Relational psychological contracts on the other
hand are longer-term employments and they involve also other aspects than just
financial gains. Both sides invest more than just money and work performance.
Both sides can sometimes expect altruistic actions from the other party. This
contract is based on trust and loyalty. Employee can trust his/her contract to
continue if he/she does her job properly. The two types Rousseau (1989) has
described, are usually two extremes and the actual relationship is somewhere
between the line (Viitala, 2008).

25

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

The nature of the psychological contract has connection to employee job
satisfaction, willingness to stay in the organization’s service, as well as to his/her
respect for the organization. In transactional psychological contracts, the employee
works only for money. In relational psychological contract the employee feels that
he/she is part of that company and identify themselves to it (Viitala, 2008).
Psychological contract should be taken seriously because it is strongly linked to
higher commitment to organization, higher employee satisfaction as well as better
employment relations (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p. 421).

3.2 Employee turnover
There are two types of turnover, voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary turnover
refers to the dismissal of employees, whereas voluntary turnover occurs when
employees themselves resign. This thesis focuses on voluntary turnover intentions.
Turnover can be caused by something else than just poor commitment. Young and
still studying employees are natural to leave. Sometimes increasing payments and
improving conditions may reduce turnover but more often mere raises to
payments are not the solution for turnover problems. Moreover, typical reasons
have been in studies the following: work does not come up to expectations, the
lack of support and attention of superior, poor induction and insufficient skills,
narrow or dull assignments and lack of responsibility and independence, too few
advancement possibilities and lack of respect for personnel as well as other
managerial problems (Viitala, 2008).
Turnover is not solely a negative issue. It brings fresh ideas into the company.
Problematic are however the costs, loss of competence, the loss of investments
that have been made to develop the competence and loss of valuable information
regarding the company. Turnover can be a sign of bad management and
atmosphere. It has to be measured consistently to be able to intervene well in
advance when disturbing signs emerge (Viitala, 2008).

26

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Ways to commit personnel are for example good HR politics, which include
competitive salaries or other compensating benefits, good management /
leadership, possibilities for learning and development, possibilities for work-life
balance and interesting work. Giving realistic expectations already in recruitment
process and proper induction are also important (Viitala, 2008).
Most theories of turnover view it as a result of employee job dissatisfaction. People
who dislike their jobs, will try to find alternative employment. Studies have
consistently shown correlation between job satisfaction and turnover.
Furthermore, it seems certain that this correlation is causal – job dissatisfaction
leads to turnover (Spector, 1997, p. 62), see Figure 4.

Figure 4. Model of employee turnover as a function of job satisfaction and unemployment rate (Spector, 1997)

Turnover intention can be described to be a conscious and deliberate willfulness to
leave the organization. It is typically measured with reference to a specific interval,
e.g. within the next 12 months. It is the last in a sequence of withdrawal cognitions
(thinking of quitting, searching for alternative employment etc.) (Tett & Meyer,
1993).
“Despite their importance in affecting work attitudes and behaviours, the role of
employees’ justice perceptions in the turnover process has not been adequately
addressed in the current literature (Griffeth et al., 2000 as cited in Loi et al., 2006).
Past studies of organizational justice have identified two major types of justice
perceptions: distributive justice, which refers to fairness perception of outcomes;
and procedural justice, which refers to the fairness perception of procedures used
27

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

to decide the outcome allocation.” “The underlying processes through which
organizational justice leads to employee turnover remain largely unknown” (Loi,
Hang-Yue & Foley, 2006). This is a noteworthy finding also regarding this
particular research.

3.3 Employee retention
Ghosh et al. (2013) describe that when an employee quits an organization, it is a
difficult situation both for the organization as well as other employees. It is a
setback professionally, it disturbs the social life, teamwork, superior-subordinate
relationships, and there is a negative effect on the company’s relationships with
other organizations. Productivity drops because of the learning curve of
understanding the work task and the organization. Moreover, the firms do not
merely lose their human capital but also the competitors potentially gain these
assets (Ghosh, Satyawadi, Prasad & Shadman, 2013).
“The cost of employee turnover entails the expenditure already incurred on
training and development of employees who leave the organization, and the
amount to be spent on recruitment, selection and training of new incumbents.”
Ghosh et al (2013) explain that this kind of rapid employee turnover is not good
for the image of the company also as a secure employer. Keeping in perspective all
such costs of employee turnover, organizations have understood that it is
important to retain employees and create a stable workforce, and companies have
started focusing on the formulation and implementation of an effective retention
strategy to effectively reduce employee turnover. Thus, employee retention
strategies have gradually become an essential part of an organization's overall
business strategies (Ghosh et al., 2013).
Armstrong, Brooks and Riemenschneider (2015) state that the supply of
information systems professionals is being outstripped by the demand, which
highlights retention as an important strategic issue. The question is how to keep
these valued IS professionals during this high demand (Armstrong et al., 2015).

28

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Armstrong et al. (2015) have studied the connection between exhaustion (and
burnout) from IS career experience and turn-away intentions. They have used the
Job Demands-Resources model in their study, which is discussed below. They
found out that perceptions of fairness are very important to individuals across any
particular job and across the entire IS career.
Job Demands-Resources
One important theory in work psychology according to Kinnunen et al. (2005) is
Job Demands-Resources model of Demerouti et al. (2001) and Schaufeli & Bakker
(2004) that is based on the assumption that work features can be divided to
demands and resources (Kinnunen et al., 2005, p.57) Kinnunen et al. (2005) state
that the job demands mean physical, psychological, social or organizational
features of the job that demand both mental and physical effort from the employee.
These can be noise, time pressure, poor atmosphere or uncertainty of continuance.
Job resources on the other hand mean the physical, psychological, social or
organizational factors that help to achieve the goals set for the work, which reduce
the demand factors and their negative consequences and enhance individual growth
and development. Resources can include e.g. good working conditions, influencing
possibilities, feedback, social support and certainty of job continuance (Kinnunen et
al., 2005, p. 57).
The demand factors are expected to initiate an energy path that leads to increased
problems in coping and then to deteriorated health and lower working ability. The
resource factors on the other hand are expected to initiate a motivation path that
advances the employee commitment to the work task and therefore the
commitment to the organization. These paths can also join. Resource factors may
diminish problems in coping or work unwell-being may lessen the commitment to
organization and increase voluntary turnover intentions. The division is however
problematic in a way that some factors may be demand factors and resource
factors simultaneously (Kinnunen et al., 2005, p.57).

29

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

According to Armstrong et al. “IS studies have highlighted the role of exhaustion in
determining outcomes such as turnover (e.g., Ahuja et al. 2007, Moore 2000,
Rutner et al. 2008), but IS researchers have recently turned their attention to turnaway intention and its connection with job-related burnout (Shropshire and
Kadlec, 2012). Within the burnout literature, researchers are beginning to
recognize the importance of looking at work-related experiences across
one’s career (Barbier et al. 2013, Jourdain & Chenevert 2010), but the relationship
between career-related exhaustion and turn-away intention remains underexplored.” (Armstrong et al., 2015).

3.3.1 Factors affecting retention
Commitment to a certain job has been described with individual factors, work
condition factors and with an interaction aspect that combines the first two.
Individual factors include gender, position level and personality. In Finnish
research, either men have been more committed or there has not been found
differences based on gender. Position level related studies have found out that
commitment has been stronger in upper position levels. What however always
affects to work commitment, are the individual’s own needs and experience of the
work’s meaningfulness (Kinnunen et al, 2005).
Ghosh et al. have studied the factors that are strong predictors of intention to stay.
Identifying these is essential in finding out those who intend to quit, in advance, so
that remedial measures can be taken to retain them, especially if they are talents
or key employees. Ghosh et al. gathered data of seven factors: Goal Clarity,
Autonomy, Employee Engagement, Affective Commitment, Organizational Culture,
Compensation and Benefits, and Normative Commitment and found out that
Affective Commitment, Normative Commitment and Goal Clarity were the best
predictors of employees' intention to stay or leave the organization (Ghosh et al.,
2013).
Factors that influence retention according Ghosh et al. (2013), include financial
rewards and employee benefits, job enrichment, training and development

30

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

opportunities, work environment, and work-life balance. They explain that Firth et
al. (2004) have explored that the experience of job related stress, the range factors
that lead to job related stress, lack of commitment in the organization and job
dissatisfaction make employees to quit. According to Magner et al. (1996),
employees feel comfortable to stay longer in positions where they are involved in
some level of the decision-making process. Herman (1999) has discussed five
principal reasons why employees leave companies: incompatible corporate
culture, unsatisfactory relationships with coworkers, insufficient support,
inadequate opportunities for growth, and dissatisfaction with compensation
offered. It is important for the employer to understand why the voluntarily
resigned leave (Ghosh et al., 2013).

3.4 About knowledge work and knowledge work-intensive organizations

Knowledge work and organizations that are knowledge-intensive “revolve around
the use of intellectual and analytical tasks and are typically seen as requiring an
extensive theoretical education and experience to be carried out successfully. Jobs
are less routine and call for some degree of creativity and adaptation to specific
circumstances. Examples of knowledge-intensive firms include management and
IT consultancies, and high tech and R&D based companies.” (Alvesson, 2004, p. 1).
Finland has long been a leading country in ICT development. The European
Commission’s The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) is “a composite index
that summarizes relevant indicators on Europe’s digital performance and tracks
the evolution of EU member states in digital competitiveness” (European
Commission, 2020). Finland reached the peak position in this in 2019. Finnish
citizens’ digital skills are clearly above the EU average. A high level of knowhow is
one of Finland’s competitive edges (Finnish Government, 2020).
Drucker (2007) has described knowledge workers as follows: “Even if employed
full-time by the organization, fewer and fewer people are “subordinates” – even in
fairly low-level jobs. Increasingly they are “knowledge workers”. And knowledge
workers are not subordinates, they are “associates”. For once beyond the

31

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

apprentice stage, they must know more about their job than their boss does… Add
to this, that today’s superiors usually have not held the jobs their subordinates
hold, as they did only few decades ago.” (Drucker, 2007, p. 15).
Drucker (2007) describes that their relationship is far more like that between the
conductor of an orchestra and the instrumentalist than it is like the traditional
superior/subordinate relationship. Drucker says that “the superior in an
organization employing knowledge workers cannot do the work of the supposed
subordinate any more than the conductor of an orchestra can play the tuba. In
turn, the knowledge worker is dependent on the superior to give direction and,
above all, to define what the “score” is for the entire organization, that is, what are
standards, values, performance and results.“ (Drucker, 2007, p. 17).
Drucker (2007) states also that knowledge workers need to be managed as if they
were volunteers. They own their “means of production”, which is their knowledge.
Drucker agrees with Hertzberg that money alone fails to motivate them to perform
but it is rather a hygiene factor; dissatisfaction with money grossly demotivates.
Knowledge workers need the challenge, they have to find satisfaction from the
work. They have to believe in the organization’s mission and they also need
continuous training. In the end, one does not manage people. The task is to lead
people. Moreover, the goal is to make productive the specific strengths and
knowledge of each individual (Drucker, 2007, p. 17-19).
Knowledge-worker productivity is the biggest of the 21st century management
challenges according Drucker. Six major factors determine knowledge-worker
productivity:
1. Knowledge worker productivity demands that we ask the question “What is the
task?”
2. It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the
individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge workers have to manage
themselves. They have to have autonomy.
3. Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility
of knowledge workers.

32

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

4. Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge
worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the knowledge worker.
5. Productivity of the knowledge worker is not – at least not primarily – a matter of
the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.
6. Finally, knowledge-worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is
both seen and treated as an “asset” rather than a “cost”. It requires that knowledge
workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.
Drucker also describes what the emergence of knowledge worker and knowledgeworker productivity mean for the governance of the corporation. The purpose of
the employing organization and of its management have to be redefined satisfying
the legal owners, shareholders and owners of human capital – knowledge workers.
In addition, the ability to attract and hold the best of the knowledge workers is the
first and foremost fundamental precondition (Drucker, 2007, p. 123-137).
Alveson (2004) lists specific circumstances to knowledge-intensive companies as
against other organizations in terms of the nature of the work and how it is
managed and organized (1995). These include (1) highly qualified individuals
doing knowledge-based work, using intellectual and symbolic skills in work, (2) a
fairly high degree of autonomy and the downplaying of organizational hierarchy,
(3) the use of adaptable, ad hoc organizational forms, (4) the need for extensive
communication for coordination and problem-solving, (5) idiosyncratic client
services, (6) information and power asymmetry (often favoring the professional
over the client) and (7) subjective and uncertain quality assessment (Alveson,
2004, p. 21).
A strong knowledge base and emphasis on competence development are key
features of knowledge-intensive companies. Alveson (2004) states three aspects of
knowledge intensive work: the ambiguity of knowledge, ambiguity of its
significance and the ambiguities of the results. Knowledge workers have to operate
with uncertainty. Alveson also explains that emphasizing ambiguity as a general
feature of not only knowledge but contemporary societies and organizations in
general gives a different understanding of why experts surpass the simple
acceptance that sophisticated knowledge brings about good results. One may

33

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

engage experts because they bring legitimation (institutionalized norms say they
need to be used) and by using them it may be easier to avoid responsibility, if
decisions appear misguided in retrospect. “Incorporating ambiguity as a key
dimension challenges and reframes the conventional understanding of the nature
and management of knowledge-intensive organizations.” (Alveson, 2004, p. 69).
Alveson (2004) states that managing knowledge-intensive fields is partly about
corporate rhetoric and image management. These offer a way to shape
expectations and are a powerful management control. According to Alveson
knowledge development is dependent on social interaction: “a) being perceived as
having links with bodies that confirm one’s knowledge-intensiveness, b) forming
and maintaining specific ties with specific clients and customers and c)
orchestrating the interactions involved in operating in socially and politically finetuned ways”. (Alveson, 2004.)
Quality assessment of knowledge-intensiveness is especially hard. Only insiders
(within the same knowledge field) can evaluate who is very knowledgeable in a
way that is broadly credible. This sets certain norms considering knowledgeintensive companies recruiting for example. Diplomas and certificates from
prestigious institutes let you know that that person has been recognized
knowledgeable by other such persons in that same field. However, this is still not a
guarantee that this person fits the job best. In fact, some companies according to
Alveson value more creativity, flexibility or process skills than knowledge itself.
But usually for a knowledge-intensive company it is crucial to nurture the image of
being highly knowledgeable (Alveson, 2004).

3.5 About management of knowledge organizations

The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has studied criteria for good
management with several actors in welfare and public sector and come up with
five different themes with which organizations can evaluate and improve
management. These are trust and respect, co-operation and networks, diversity
and individualism, competence and development and reforming and involvement.

34

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

Fair decision-making and treatment of personnel are prerequisite for trust in the
work place. In addition, fair management, compliance with agreed policies,
interaction that respects others, responsibility, honesty and open communication
all advance trust in the work community. Trust is especially needed in times of
organizational change. (Finnish Institute of Occupational health, 2020.)
Amar & Hlupic (2016) have studied leadership theories and practices that are
successful in improving specifically the performance of knowledge workers.
Leadership of knowledge organizations is different from the leadership of
traditional organizations. Amar & Hlupic have concluded seven propositions for
managers how to lead to obtain better innovation and productivity from
knowledge workers. Through an extensive literature review, they discovered that
management is moving towards approaches that are innovative, emerging and
collaborative. These transcend the role of one individual and are more about
interaction, absence of leader’s control, sharing, networking and self-organizing.
Moreover, there is a power shift from the leader towards the knowledge workers
who can decide whether to reduce their taking part in value adding or not.
The researcher finds important to introduce these propositions by Amar and
Hlupic in this thesis:
“P1. Due to the differences in the function of leading between traditional and
knowledge organizations, it is very unlikely to carry out effectively the leadership
responsibilities to get innovation in knowledge organizations using the traditional
leadership.
P2a. In an organization where a variety of unique tasks are executed for
innovation, it is unlikely for any one individual to carry out effectively the
leadership responsibilities.
P2b. A knowledge organization will be led more effectively if the formal leader
eschews most power and creates an environment of shared leadership.
P3. In any organization where the use of authority is low, such as a knowledge
organization, an individual with “in-control” behavior (as reflected by the
“Internalizer” classification based on the scores on Rotter, 1966 Internal-External
scale) will increase the likelihood of his/her success as a leader.
35

|

P4. Motivation in workers to engage in behaviors that result in innovation comes
from creating and operating organization as a mutualism, resulting in a collective
reward or punishment for all members.
P5. In an organization, such as a knowledge organization, that works to produce
innovation, lax control should be ubiquitous for building a fluid, distributed, and
trust-based community.
P6. Semblance of chaos in groups engaged in innovation work is normal to occur
when a functioning leader frequently relinquishes power which one of the other
members of the group can assume; however, from such a chaos, a leadership
homeostasis emerges and establishes an order according to which the leadership,
rather than being concentrated in a leader, becomes distributed and dormant in all
group members.
P7. Because of the practice of shared leadership in knowledge organizations,
expecting workers to give their unquestioned loyalties to their superiors or other
individuals may be detrimental to the functioning of the organization. Instead, the
workers should be encouraged to commit to a set of principles.”
What is emphasized in Amar and Hlupic’s (2016) study, is that management
should empower the knowledge workers themselves to take control of their work
and in this the intrinsic motivators of each individual are essential. This demands
certain supportive resources from management. There is a consensus of the need
for new governance approaches for knowledge organizations. (Amar & Hlupic,
2016).
According Bolisani & Scarso (2011), management should pay attention to the links
between Human Resource Management (HRM) and Knowledge Management (KM).
Moreover, human resources are involved in KM in many ways, and broadly
speaking the relationship between KM and HRM can be seen under two different
perspectives. The first perspective sees employees as the ultimate users of the
knowledge an organization possesses. Thereby, the relationship between HRM and
KM can be seen in the organization of training activities, the provision of
knowledge-based services, the facilitation of employees’ interaction, etc. The
second perspective sees that a successful implementation of KM requires

36

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

personnel that is specifically employed and trained for managing such initiatives.
More importantly, they state that the practical implementation of KM requires
changes in the way people are managed, for instance with the aim of influencing
individuals to assume a knowledge-sharing attitude (Bolisani & Scarso, 2011).
Bartlett & Ghoshal (2002) have studied the value of human capital in building
competitive advantage. They state that “a decade of organizational delayering,
destaffing, restructuring and reengineering has produced employees who are more
exhausted than empowered, more cynical than self-renewing. Worse still, in many
companies only marginal managerial attention -- if that-- is focused on the
problems of employee capability and motivation. Somewhere between theory and
practice, precious human capital is being misused, wasted or lost.” Bartlett &
Ghoshal discovered that very few top executives have been able to transform
themselves from being analytically driven strategy directors to people-oriented
strategy framers. Therefore, they have claimed for three critical changes for top
executives to make: a changing view of strategic resources, a changing view of
value, and a changing view of senior managers' roles. In addition, human-resources
managers must take active roles in developing a company's strategy. Many firms
claim that people are their most important asset, but few have actually built the HR
systems, processes or cultures that can even offset, let alone challenge, the deeply
embedded bias toward financial assets. Bartlett & Ghoshal state that HR must help
management develop the engaging, motivating and bonding culture necessary to
attract and keep talented employees. Only in such a culture, the potential in
competent individuals and fully functioning networks can be converted into
engaged, committed action (Bartlett & Ghoshal, 2002).
Nelson and Todd (Nelson & Todd, 2003. Peopleware: The Hiring and Retention of
IT personnel in Igbaria & Shavo (Ed.), Strategies for managing IS/IT personnel)
have formed a set of best practices that are designed to help organizations develop
strategy, recruit, hire, develop, compensate, and ultimately retain valued IT
personnel. Their model describes the key drivers of job satisfaction, and ultimately
determine turnover. Nelson and Todd have similar thoughts than Bartlett and
Ghoshal. They, too, think that for the IT manager to become a builder of human
resources, he or she must view employees as assets whose value can be enhanced

37

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

through training and experience. They have researched that those factors related
to the work itself (including work arrangements, flexibility and autonomy, the
work environment, and reward and recognition) have the most significant overall
effect on job satisfaction and thus on decisions related to employee turnover.
Career issues related to training, development, and advancement opportunities are
the next most important factors. Finally, compensation and benefits exert
relatively little influence in the overall equation. This is not to say that
compensation is not important, but rather that work and career issues are the key
differentiators in determining employee satisfaction. Managing these issues can
significantly assist organizations to manage employee retention and turnover.
Furthermore, it is important to note that management quality is the critical driver
of all of these issues (Nelson & Todd, as in Igbaria & Shavo, 2003).
Roepke, Agarwal and Ferrat (2000) also agree with previous. According them there
is agreement that a company’s IT human capital makes the critical capability that
needs to be appropriately managed and nurtured.

3.6 Evidence-based management

Pfeffer and Sutton (2006) have wrote about evidence-based management and
organizational culture’s role in it. Management decisions that should be done
based on the best evidence, systematically learning from past experience, and
principles of thought and analysis, are in fact often done based on hope or fear,
what others seem to be doing, or what senior leaders have done or believe is right.
Evidence-based practice has been in use in the field of medicine for some time
already and gradually more in education, but it has little affected on the way most
companies operate. The model of evidence-based medicine has inspired the
evidence-based management movement. One important notion in their study is
that the use of data and evidence changes power dynamics cutting down the
importance of a single leader’s opinion (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006).

38

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

In this thesis, the researcher wants to point out the meaning of assessment and
analysis in this topic. Without systematical assessment from the employer’s side,
the managerial decisions are not really evidence-based. Assumptions can be
dangerous and often are misguiding.

4 Methodology and empirical study
In this chapter, an overview of the research methodology that has been applied in
this thesis, is presented and discussed. The general aim of the research will be
elaborated and then the data collection methods introduced. The researcher will
describe the method for providing answers to the posited research questions.

4.1. Research method
In terms of the research method, this research has been conducted using a mixed
approach, as in combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. The
researcher uses a survey research, that “comprises a cross-sectional research
design in relation to which data will be collected predominantly by questionnaire
or by structured interview on more than one case (multiple-case study) and at a
single point in time in order to collect a body of quantitative data in connection
with two or more variables, which are then examined to detect patterns of
association” (Bryman & Bell, 2015, p. 54).
Quantitative research: A quantitative approach to research is likely to be
associated with a deductive approach to testing theory (principal orientation to
the role of theory in relation to research), often using number or fact and therefore
a positivist or natural science model (epistemological orientation), and an
objectivist view of the objects studied (ontological orientation) (Greener, 2008, p.
17; Bryman & Bell, 2015).
Qualitative research: A qualitative approach to research is likely to be associated
with an inductive approach to generating theory (principal orientation to the role of
theory in relation to research), often using an interpretivist model (epistemological
orientation) allowing the existence of multiple subjective perspectives and
constructing knowledge rather than seeking to “find” it in “reality (ontological
orientation) (Greener, 2008, p. 17; Bryman & Bell, 2015).

40

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Since the topic of the thesis can be comprehended as a broad and subjective matter,
a mixed methods approach appeared suitable for gathering data as it enables a
more complete picture to be drawn. The sample size is too small for only a
quantitative study but when a qualitative interview part is added, especially so that
the answers to the questionnaire guide the interview questions formulating, the
reliability improves. The literature review has naturally provided a basis for the
actual empirical study that consisted of, as said, first a more quantitative part after
which a qualitative part followed. According Hirsjärvi et al. (2005), a qualitative
research is understood to be a unique description of the current situation and it
seldom succeeds in obtaining generalizable information (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005).
The nature of this research is to construct knowledge to provide indication for
action or further research, see Figure 5.

Figure 5. Deductive and inductive approaches to the relationship between theory and research by Bryman

4.2. Data collection method and sample
The research questions guide the decision about what data to collect and from
whom. This study uses a mixed-methods approach with both quantitative and
qualitative methods. Convenience sampling (available to the researcher because of
its accessibility) has been used to gather the needed data from the participants of
ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Only original data

41

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

collected for the specific research goal has been used. The main data collection
methods are a self-completion questionnaire and structured in-depth interviews.
Questionnaires are a way to collect data systematically by obtaining answers on the
key issues and opinions that are being researched. They use a number of methods,
closed questions, ranking in order, Likert scales or open-ended questions
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
Interviews are a research method by which the researcher can obtain factual data
and insights into attitudes and feelings. They can be structured, unstructured or
semi-structured. In this theses there has been used structured interviews, with
which the researcher can obtain answers to a pre-prepared set of questions. This
way every topic is covered and there is minimal variation between respondents
(Armstrong & Taylor, 2014).
In order to collect data and find answers for the research questions, a survey was
made in the first phase of the empirical part. Possible participants were asked from
20 ICT-companies and after that also from higher education IT-departments. The
researcher conducted an anonymous questionnaire via E-lomake online platform.
Before the actual distribution in 21.2.-6.3.2020, the questionnaire was piloted with
two persons to avoid any misunderstandings and wastage occurring. After the pilot,
the link was sent to the HR contact persons in participating organizations
who then, in turn, forwarded the survey link to their employees for answering. The
survey questionnaire was aimed at ICT-professionals in Finland. Primarily the
focus was in ICT-companies but after low participation interest, the higher
education institutions’ ICT-departments were included in queries. Study objects
were chosen with convenience sampling from fitting profile (ICT-professionals).
The questionnaire consisted of demographic questions, structured statements on a
6-point Likert scale and open questions. Therefore it uses both quantitative and
qualitative methods. The questionnaire was constructed on the basis of already
validated job satisfaction surveys. The variables have been formulated on the basis
of previous knowledge work studies as well as Spector’s Job Satisfaction Survey

42

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

(JSS) and Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). They are not derived as such,
but are tailored for this study’s purpose. This way the study is sensitive to the
context and relevant to this particular study’s research questions. 7-point Likert
scale is usually suitable for conducting survey related to behavior or attitude.
However, the option of “I don’t know” was deliberately omitted as uninformative,
since the sample size was already low. Thus, a 6-point Likert scale was used in the
structured statements section, where 1 = I very much disagree and 6 = I very much
agree. This choice was motivated by the reference satisfaction survey JSS, which
also has a 6-point scale.
The subjects for the second phase of the empirical study, the in-depth interviews,
were also a convenience sample. The participants gave their consent to conducting
interviews, after which a suitable timetable was agreed upon. In addition, they
were informed of the recording of interviews in advance.

4.3 Presentation of study object and ethical considerations
This section presents the study context. Because of the sensitive nature of this
research, the researcher respects participants’ anonymity and will not describe
them in any detail. What can be said regarding the context of this study, is however
that all of the participants work in specifically ICT-related tasks. The participants
for the first part of the study are employees of two ICT-sector companies (one
small, one big sized enterprise) and of one higher education institution’s ICTdepartment. The participants for the second part of the study are employees of a
global software company and of a global health technology firm’s software unit.
The reason for including also other industries besides the ICT-sector is that ICTprofessionals commonly work also outside ICT-companies. All position levels were
included in research.
Due to the anonymity promise, the researcher will not publish any names or such
information that can help in forming or tracking links to respondents. Their data
are gathered and restored confidentially and only for the specific research
purpose. Ethical aspects were taken into account already in preparation stage

43

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

when some basic information of the study and its purpose was sent to contacts and
then to the participants. The researcher informed all participants in advance that
privacy and anonymity would be respected in giving information of the research
and its results. In addition, the participation was voluntary and short. This was
important in order to make the participants feel free to share their feelings and
give as much information as they should like. This was also informed to encourage
organizations to participate in the first place. The researcher wants to ensure that
there is no prospect of any harm coming to participants.

4.4 About conducting job satisfaction questionnaires
There are two different approaches to the study of job satisfaction. They are the
global approach and the facet approach. Global approach studies job satisfaction as
a single, overall feeling toward the job, whereas the facet approach focuses on job
facets or different aspects of the job. The facet approach allows a more complete
picture of job satisfaction (Spector, 2012, p. 216-217).
There are advantages and disadvantages to using an existing job satisfaction scale.
Many available scales do cover most facets of satisfaction. They have also been
used a sufficient number of times to provide norms (Spector, 1997, p. 6). Spector’s
Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) has been of great influence to the survey for this
thesis. Another influence has been the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)
which is also already widely recognized. Both have been tested many times to be
reliable and valid.

4.4.1 Spector’s Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS)
The Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) by Spector assesses nine facets of job satisfaction,
as well as overall satisfaction, see Figure 6. These are pay, promotion, supervision,
fringe benefits, contingent rewards, operating conditions, coworkers, nature of
work and communication. The scale contains 36 items and uses a summated rating
scale format which is the most popular format for job satisfaction scales and
relatively easy to modify. The internal consistency reliability (coefficient alpha)
44

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

has been computed and the value was .91 in total of all facets (based on a sample of
3067 individuals) which is considered to be excellent (Spector, 1997).

Figure 6. 9 facets of Job Satisfaction by Spector

4.4.2 Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)
The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire is another satisfaction scale that has
been very popular among researchers. MSQ (1966) has a 100-item long version
and a 20-item short version. The short form is used to assess either global
satisfaction or intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction, see Figure 7. Intrinsic
satisfaction refers to the nature of the job tasks themselves and how people feel
about the work they do. Extrinsic satisfaction concerns other aspects of the work
situation, such as fringe benefits and pay. Both types of satisfaction are a
45

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

combination of several facets. The facets in short form are activity, independence,
variety, social status, supervision (human relations), supervision (technical), moral
values, security, social service, authority, ability utilization, company policies and
practices, compensation, advancement, responsibility, creativity, working
conditions, coworkers, recognition and achievement (Spector, 1997, p. 15-16,
221).

Figure 7. Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire scales (short form)

4.4.3 The job satisfaction questionnaire for this research
The questionnaire of this thesis was influenced by JSS and MSQ facets but based on
literature findings for knowledge workers. Naturally, it was designed to answer to
the research questions. Because of low participation interest, the response rate
needed to be as good as possible, and this was reason to why the questionnaire

46

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

had to be short. In addition to demographics, the actual job satisfaction questions
regarded values, inner coherence of the employee, ability utilization,
meaningfulness, achievement, work-life balance, general satisfaction of one’s job,
competence, recognition, training possibility, willingness for a career in the
organization, monetary salary, benefits, advancement possibility, supervisor
competence, clarity of instructions, ease of feedback, work environment,
communication’s openness, coworkers’ competence and fairness of corporate
culture. Participants were also asked to answer open questions by mentioning
three things that increase and that decrease their job satisfaction. They were asked
about their actual intention of leaving and the reasons for their choice. This way
they were offered the possibility to shed more light on the topic than if only given
structured options.

4.5 Interview questions for this research
The interview questions were formulated based on the three research questions.
However, as this part was done after the survey questionnaire was conducted,
some key items were included in the interviews, such as communication’s
effectiveness, salary and benefit policies as well as fairness of corporate culture.
Interviews needed to be relatively short but still informative enough to cover all
facets of interest. This guided the question formulation. In conclusion, three
subjects, job satisfaction, turnover intentions and managerial work, were included
with 3-4 questions per subject.

4.6 Chosen method for analysis
Quantitative analysis has been done using IBM SPSS Statistics software. With SPSS
descriptive analysis is convenient to display. Qualitative analysis has been done
using data-driven content analysis by the researcher. First NVivo was considered
as a software program tool, but it was discarded due to the small amount of
analyzable material.

47

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Content analysis for open questions in the survey
In content analysis the researcher looks for patterns in qualitative data. In datadriven content analysis, the researcher extracts the most relevant issues from the
data regardless of previous theories or hypotheses. The data guides the analysis
being done, see Figure 8. The first phase is to reduce the material where the
relevant parts are searched and marked with e.g. highlighting. The marked parts
are reduced by writing them in shorter form. The next phase is clustering where
the reduced expressions are grouped in such a way that same-meaning-things form
together a subgroup. These are then labelled with a title describing the content.
Finally, in the third phase classifying continues so that the researcher can form
upper groups from the subgroups and main groups from these upper groups.
These are then all labelled with appropriate title.

5 Analysis and interpretation of results
In this thesis an online questionnaire was distributed to gather data from ICTprofessionals of their job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Data were collected
for two weeks in 21.2.-6.3.2020. A total of 19 questionnaires were returned from
100 presumed responses so the response rate (the percentage of a sample that
agreed to participate and gave usable answers) was 19 per cent. Because the study
was done among the representatives of same occupation, the expected
heterogeneity of the population from which the sample was taken, was low. This is
important since the greater the heterogeneity, the larger the sample would need to
be. In this thesis the sample was quite small, but it is not problematic in this aspect.
This following section will present a comprehensive analysis of the obtained
answers and interpretation of the results.

5.1. Main findings from survey questionnaire
The job satisfaction questionnaire for ICT-personnel
Descriptive analysis
In the first part of the questionnaire, some basic demographic information was
collected from the participants. Descriptive analysis is used to show here the
summaries of participants’ background information. The sample of participants
finally consisted of three different organizations’ employees. They represent two
ICT-sector companies and one higher education institute’s ICT-department. The
survey was targeted to ICT-professionals in Finland.
Demographic questions
Among the respondents that participated in this research, 14 were males and 5
females. 2 respondents were of age 18 -30 years, 5 respondents were of age 31-40
years, 4 respondents were of age 41-50 years and 8 respondents of age over 50
49

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

years. 3 had ICT-work experience of 0-5 years, 2 of 6-10 years and 14 of them for
over 10 years. In terms of highest completed education, 3 answered to have upper
secondary school, 9 a Bachelor’s degree and 7 a Master’s degree. From position
level, 6 were labourer, 8 officials, 3 upper officials and 2 managers.
The factors affecting ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction
In the survey questionnaire the researcher asked first are the employees familiar
with their organization’s values. Values are a keen part of organizational culture, as
are beliefs, norms, attitudes and assumptions, and values are what guide the way
people in organizations behave (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014, p 120).
To the question Do you know the values of your organization? nobody indicated that
they do not know the values. Two respondents said they know the values partly.
Values can be rather vague if they are not clearly expressed to the employees and
especially if they are not being in actual use in the company.
Second question was If you know the values, do you share them? There were
thirteen respondents who did share their organization’s values and six
respondents who shared the values only partly. Nobody indicated that they didn’t
share the values at all.
Being aware of the values first of all is meaningful, because then the employee
knows what the organization he/she works for, stands for or represents and what
kind of behavior is expected among its employees. The result that out of nineteen,
six respondents shared the values only partly, gives an indication that the values of
an ICT-organization do not always necessarily match with its employees, at least
not with these respondents. Why this is the case, would need further exploring and
no general conclusions can be made from this result. Still, it should be noticed and
analyzed by the employer, if not all its employees can share the same values.
In the second part of the survey questionnaire there were 22 statements that were
to be assessed on a 6-point Likert scale. The options were as follows: 1 = I disagree

50

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

very much, 2 = I disagree moderately, 3 = I disagree slightly, 4 = I agree slightly, 5 =
I agree moderately and 6 = I agree very much. Option “I don’t know” was left out
deliberately as uninformative.
The researcher will here divide the results into groups. They are not in the same
order as in the actual questionnaire formula, but grouped into intrinsic factors and
extrinsic factors as well as general factors of motivation. They are also classified
according JSS and MSQ scales per facet.
Extrinsic factors:

What is noticeable, is the relatively large amount of disagreeing answers to this
particular question. 9 persons disagree and 10 persons agree with salary matching
to their job performance and skills. Why this is, needs further exploring.

9 disagreed and 10 agreed with the statement of having a chance for promotion
and career development on the job, so this did raise very mixed emotions. The
researcher started to wonder if there are certain types of jobs among ICTprofessionals that do not have prospects the same way, or is that dependent of the
employer, or what is the reason behind these results. This needs further research.

This question caused a lot of distribution. What is rather interesting is that only
one person agreed very much with this statement, however six agreed moderately
and six slightly. Moreover, three disagreed slightly, one moderately and one
disagreed very much. This seems to go in line with theories that ICT-professionals
are more committed to their occupation than their employer organization.

Again interestingly, the results divided to either disagreeing moderately or very
much (7), to agreeing from slightly to very much (12). The reasons behind this
result need further examining, are they for example organization-dependent. It is
still a quite worrying signal for employers that so many respondents perceive their
organization as not so fair.
In addition, the values were separately researched in the beginning of the
questionnaire. They were placed first because of their importance to the whole
topic and because values provide the foundation on which the organization
operates. The first question of values awakens the respondents instantly to think
what their organization is about and the second question awakens them to think
what they themselves want to represent. The answers to first one show that
employees are aware of their company’s values and the answers to second show

Again the majority of the respondents agreed with the statement and do get a
feeling of accomplishment from their job. This is a positive indication to overall job
satisfaction. Reduced feeling of accomplishment from job is related to exhaustion
and a risk for burnout. (Armstrong et al., 2015). The employer can fortify the
feelings of accomplishment by giving more feedback of the results of work activities
and successful deliveries. This feedback may also come from coworkers.

Clear majority of the respondents of this survey do enjoy their working
environment.
Next is presented a table of the mean scores of each statement’s values. The mean
represents the overall satisfaction of respondents with the facet in question. The

66

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

mean score for all facet means was 4.25, which demonstrates the overall job
satisfaction of all respondents in total. This value shows it is above scale center,
but in such a small amount, that it can be assumed there is need for improvement,
at least in some areas. This finding regards these participants and cannot be
generalized. Despite this, there are many interesting notions to be made
concerning managing ICT-pfrofessionals.

Open questions
The statements were followed by some open questions. In the content analysis the
researcher started by writing down the open answers and searching frequencies in
the words and similar meanings. These were then colour-coded which made it
easier to group the same-meaning wordings. It became noticeable that the
respondents’ answers had much in common.
Here are the main findings (n=19 responses in total) of data-driven content
analysis of the survey’s qualitative data according frequency:
Mention three things that would increase most your job satisfaction.
(clustered and labeled):
1) Salary (9 x)
2) Benefits (8 x)
3) Communication (7 x)
4) Fairness (4 x)
5) Management (3 x)
68

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

6) Training (3 x)
7) Atmosphere (3 x)
8) Work in itself (2 x)
“Small increase in my salary, sometimes a bit more clarity in my role, guidance from my manager”
“Autonomy, remote work possibility, fair pay”

Mention three things that most decrease your job satisfaction.
(clustered and labeled):
1) Communication (8 x)
2) Workload (6 x)
3) Management (6 x)
4) Benefits (6 x)
5) Atmosphere (6 x)
6) Salary (5 x)
7) Fairness (3 x)
8) Training (3 x)
”Keeping secrets, not enough training, micromanagement”

”Continuous hectic workload, I couldn’t be myself at work if I didn’t have a trusted colleague /
manager to go and talk to when needed.”

When both of these columns are examined, we see that communication has been
mentioned most often altogether (8+7=15). It seems thus that communication is
extremely important in knowledge-work companies. ICT-professionals expect to
have clarification to their own work responsibilities. The more abstract and
systems-dependent the work is, the more essential is good communication. Nearly
as crucial appears to be salary for the respondents of this study (9+5=14) and also
benefits (8+6=14). After these come management (3+6=9), atmosphere (3+6=9),
fairness (4+3=7), training (3+3=6) and workload (0+6=6). Last comes work in

itself (2+0=2), which was a surprise to the researcher that it was not actually
mentioned more often.
The open questions in the survey offered as expected, very valuable insights of the
reasons behind the choices. These were followed by a question of actual intentions
of leaving.

goes along with one respondent with work experience of 0-3 years and two
respondents with experience of over 10 years responded negatively. These
negatively responded were two Bachelor’s degree holders and one Master’s degree
holder and from position levels they were (not in any order) a labourer, an official
and a manager.
Please explain shortly your previous choice above, why?
If we first examine the reasons of “no” answers, the responses varied from 1.
wanting to move on from first permanent job in a junior position and possibly get
more educated, to 2. a misalignment between job level/skills and given
compensation, to 3. the sheer will to have just more options. The results go along
with how literature describes knowledge workers. They want to develop and
challenge themselves, they know their worth and are proud in the sense that if not
satisfied with current employment, they are quick to change to a better option.
Here is the power shift, since they own their “means of production, which is their
knowledge” as Drucker (2007) stated. On the other hand, it is only natural that
unless there is something that will bind the employee to current organization, such
as affective commitment, the employee will take a better offer should there be
such, and to ICT-professionals of high demand, there most likely is. Lack of
advancement possibilities (or the impression of the lack) and insufficient salary
appear to be the deal breakers for these participants when it comes to intention to
leave.
When we examine the reasons of “yes” answers, the offering is wider. Responses
include 1. wanting to influence the surrounding world, 2. being satisfied with
current job assignments and believing that the employer will improve certain
areas, 3. interesting projects in horizon and also coming improvements to
company practices, 4. satisfaction of workplace, job assignments and colleagues, 5.
enjoying the work, 8. feeling comfortable enough to stay in the job until pension, 9.
liking the colleagues and atmosphere, 10. liking the culture in the workplace that
takes employee well-being seriously, 11. feeling that majority in work is positive,
12. liking the work community, 13. liking the workplace in general, 14. liking the

71

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

job, the colleagues and workplace, and 15. enjoying the work itself. One
respondent told to leave the question unanswered on purpose.
Hereby we notice that the key reasons for participated ICT-professionals’
intentions to stay with their current organization consist of fitting assignments and
satisfaction in work in itself, influence possibility, good or caring organizational
culture and satisfaction in one’s co-workers. Work itself is a strong intrinsic
motivating factor according Herzberg’s theory and this aspect was emphasized in
the intentions to stay.
Other thoughts or improvement ideas?
No other thoughts or improvement ideas were given concerning the actual topic.
The only comment regarded the questionnaire table and its scalability in Chrome
browser, which was not optimal.
Influence of demographic factors to results
When we examine the overall satisfaction of each respondent, we see that it
divided in the age group 18-30, it was quite high in age group 31-40, it was
moderate in age group 41-50 and again quite high in age group over 50.
This goes along with the results’ heavy division of employees with ICT-work
experience of 0-5 years. Respondents with 6-10 years of experience were quite
satisfied and over 10 years also. Respondents’ education backgrounds made no
great differences. Females’ responses on the other hand were heavily divided,
males’ responses were more in line.

5.2 Main findings from the interviews
Interviews with ICT-professionals
The empirical study for this research consisted of two parts. First, an online
questionnaire was conducted, as explained in the previous section. In the second

72

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

part, two in-depth interviews with ICT-professionals were held (16.3.2020 and
17.3.2020) to gather more insight of the reasons behind job satisfaction in ICTrelated knowledge work and possible turnover intentions. The questions for the
interviews were pre-prepared, structured questions, but the interviewee was
given time to answer as widely as needed. Interviews lasted about an hour each,
they were recorded with participants’ consent and transcribed afterwards. The
results have been analyzed using data-driven content analysis.
Demographic questions:
The first demographic question was Your position level? to which the other
interviewee answered to be manager, though a one-man-team at the moment,
hired as an expert and the other interviewee answered to be upper official. The
next question was Your ICT-work experience in years? to which both interviewees
informed to have 7 years of experience. The third background question was Your
work experience in years in current organization? The other interviewee had 2
years and the other 4 and half years of work experience in current organization.
The fourth and final demographic question concerned Your highest completed
education? The other interviewee answered to have a Bachelor’s degree and be
currently writing Master’s, other one had a Bachelor’s degree.
Subject 1. Job satisfaction
Question 1. What factors do you think increase job satisfaction in ICT-work the
most? Why?
Things that highlighted in the answers for the first question were freedom to do
the work as you see fit, trust from the management, good working atmosphere
with appreciation from your team, and clear expectations. Also salary and
substance (meaning of the work) were mentioned as motivating factors. Both
interviewees mentioned the coworkers and salary as increasing factors.
“It is related to clear goals, clear like what is expected from you and when, not necessarily how but
what and when. Of course salary is somewhat important, and the substance of the field.”

73

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Question 2. What factors do you think decrease job satisfaction in ICT-work the
most? Why?
In terms of what decreases the respondents’ job satisfaction most, these are
micromanagement, lack of possibility to be creative, major gaps in salary
compared to others, constantly changing customer specifications, non-supportive
managers and colleagues together with unclear goals. Also lack of proper induction
was mentioned as a decreasing factor.
“I need to be creative, have my creative freedom, as well to explore things. This is not possible if
you have a boss that is micromanaging you and is trying to dictate every step.”

Question 3. What could the employer do or improve to support your job
satisfaction more?
When asked what the employer could actually do or improve to support the
respondents’ job satisfaction better, the answers varied from giving more
appreciation and recognition from a good job, giving freedom for the knowledge
worker to self-organize, boosting good company culture and offering development
possibilities, to supporting hobbies and offering remote work possibility.
“Show interest. Appreciation of the work is important, I think. If somebody does a good job,
employer should praise them or highlight them in front of the team. I think that has a positive
impact. Apart from that, trying out and giving freedom.”

Subject 2. Turnover intentions
Question 4. What do you think are the main reasons for the voluntary turnover
happening in your workplace?
In terms of voluntary turnover, the respondents believed it is due to wanting to
switch after a while to increase salary and also increase one’s skillset e.g. in
technologies, wanting to switch to well-known major companies in the industry,

74

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

employees getting frustrated with constantly changing requirements and finding it
hard to work with those and generally not adapting to a certain type of job.
“Some people just find it hard to be in that atmosphere where there is like pressure coming from
the customer but also from the management. You need to kind of try to somehow find the middle
ground how to proceed with each task. Then I know there are some guys that are very analytical…
and in my unit we have this day-to-day support and we need to give trainings and stuff… so I know
a lot of these software purist guys get frustrated on the way we work.”

Question 5. Have you changed or considered changing job while being in an ICTfield’s job?
These answers show that the respondents take pride in their job and about being
professionals in it. They have changed jobs of ICT-sector before. The need for more
creativity in work and will to have a certain type of job inside the industry is
emphasized in other interviewee’s answer, as is the need for more support when
having difficult tasks or heavy workload in other. Both interviewees were however
in a fitting job at the moment.
“I believe that if you have a constant pressure to increase your numbers, it doesn’t really allow
room for creativity or inventing new things. And that is what my current job is all about.”
“I have considered changing from my current position as well but that is something that happens
maybe once or twice a year, I get this frustrating period of constantly difficult tasks and then I get
burned out, no not really burned out but frustrated and start to think that could there be something
else in life…”

Question 6. What should your employer have done (or do) in order for you to stay
in the organization?
The respondents indicated that in order to stay, their employer should have raised
the salary, not micromanage them and start trusting more in their capabilities,
take better care for atmosphere of the team, have a proper induction plan, as well
as be generally more aware and interested of their employee.
“If you are hired as an expert, there should be a certain level of trust in your capabilities that you
know the best way. In this start-up environment when mainly IT engineers find themselves in head
of marketing or sales which they don’t necessarily have the background for… based on that they
don’t always have the best decisions, and when it then comes to micromanagement, it’s a really,
really negative combination that can destroy a lot of the atmosphere and the motivation in the
whole team.”

75

|

Subject 3. Managerial work
Question 7. How do you think the managerial work in ICT could generally be
improved and what factors should be more taken into account in this?
The participants saw that the managerial work in ICT could be improved by being
more mindful and respecting towards different cultures, taking into account
individual needs for attention, leaving authoritarian leading and respecting
employees’ self-management capability, clarifying resourcing practices and
clarifying the goals that are expected to be reached by the employee.
“Especially in ICT-field you work globally so often and with diverse teams that I really believe that
the cultural understanding and the mindfulness is one of the biggest factors here, because some
people, they need a little more appreciation from the management. Some people like to have a
certain amount of guidance. So it’s really up to the manager to know the team and to know the
individual needs…”

Question 8. How do you think communication could be improved by the employer?
Communication was mentioned as a crucial factor in the questionnaire results, so
the researcher prepared a question of it to the interview part. Interviewees saw
that for them, it works quite well in their organizations. Another was satisfied with
the tools used for remote meetings and trainings for managers, as well as the
frequency of the face-to-face meetings. Another would have preferred not to have
irrelevant e-mails and notifications and instead only have local messages
regarding the employee. By this, the interviewee referred to avoiding information
overload in already hectic environment and receiving only necessary information.
Question 9. Are you satisfied with the salary and benefits policy of your
organization? Why?
Another question that was based on the questionnaire results regarded the salary
and benefits policy. Another interviewee was very satisfied with current salary
compared to previous and had no complaints. This interviewee valued the
possibility for whole family to live abroad and considered that as a benefit.

76

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Another interviewee indicated that the policy in itself seems quite clear and fair
inside the company but the levels of salary amounts are too low compared to other
companies. This respondent however was pleased that the employer takes
increasing knowledge and capabilities into account.
Question 10. How do you think fairness in the corporate culture could be improved
by the employer?
The third and final question about fairness in corporate culture was also based in
the questionnaire results but also to the previous findings in research. What is
highlighted in these answers is the fact that ICT-professionals want recognition for
what they do and in these cases they felt they did not get enough of it. Feedback
and praise are important and show also direction to the future performance. Both
interviewees told about situations where e.g. only a sales person gets rewarded
even though the whole team is behind the effort needed for success. They craved
for more appreciation for supporting roles and more recognition from outside
their own teams. The answers indicated uneven distribution of attention from
management. Fairness has been assessed in research as a very crucial element in a
functioning organization which this result in its own part confirms. This also goes
along with previous research that knowledge workers want to be treated as
equals.

6 Discussion and conclusions
At this point, it is appropriate to summarize the research process. After
formulating the aim and research questions that guided the choosing of methods, it
proved to be surprisingly difficult to find willing participants for the study. This
might be due to the sensitive nature of the topic. Many companies responded
politely that they unfortunately were unable to participate. Some gave arguments
like they have only recently done a personnel survey and do not want to bother
employees again with another. Some neglected to answer at all. Of 20 ICT-sector
companies or departments, only three organizations were ready to participate.
Naturally all presumable respondents would not answer, as the response rate is
almost never actually 100%.
This means that the method was re-evaluated and additional interviews with ICTprofessionals were included into the research to give more qualitative insight.
Furthermore, the questions for the interview were prepared based on the results
of the conducted questionnaire earlier as well as literature of recent research. The
qualitative data would better offer an indication of problem areas in the field of
this topic. The researcher, however, fully acknowledges the limitations caused by
the small sample size. The results are thus not to be generalized, but as said, to
highlight certain areas needing further research or improvement action.

6.1 Reflecting results in previous research (theoretical framework and literature
review)
When we examine the results and reflect the findings in the theoretical framework
and literature review, we see that they match. ICT-professionals in this thesis are
proud of their occupation and being professionals in it. As knowledge workers,
they are on a daily basis working with tasks that are complex, abstract and require
analytical skills. They deal with significant amounts of uncertainty of results. This
can be seen in the questionnaire answers for statement I get enough feedback from
my supervisor for what I do, with which the majority of respondents disagreed.
Thus, they expect to have more feedback and guidance to the operative work, since
78

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

they are unsure of how well they perform. This is specifically a managerial issue
that needs attention. This finding was accompanied by quite similar results for the
statement My supervisor explains the work objectives and expectations clearly with
which 11 agreed and as many as 8 disagreed. With complex tasks, it is even more
important to understand, what is being required of you. This is a difficult issue in
the sense that while participants felt their responsibilities were not clear enough,
they do not want micromanaging either. It is more a question of what needs to be
achieved and when, not exactly how it needs to be done, since that is precisely the
knowledge work that the employees are hired to do. But responsibilities should be
directed by the supervisor, not by knowledge workers themselves. As Drucker said
(2007), the supervisors often do not necessarily even know how to do the work, but
it is their task to show direction and give feedback of results. Based on the survey,
this directing should be more concrete and even the organizational structure of
responsibilities seems to need clarification.
Another statement that nearly half of the respondents disagreed with, was I have a
chance of promotion and career development on my job. Among ICT-professionals,
this is a rather alarming finding considering that organizations desperately want or at least they should - to retain their human capital and knowledge assets. If they
see too few advancement possibilities in their current organization, they will most
surely start looking elsewhere. As literature confirms, knowledge workers thirst for
challenge and development. At the same time developing skills increase their value
at the job market. On the other hand, increasing skills benefit the employer
organization if they are put into good use. This again raises the question of why do
the respondents feel like they don’t have a chance and what has the employer done
(or left undone) to possibly cause this. Could the employer possibly improve
advancement and career possibilities informing? Are the options for changing
tasks or job description or advancing not discussed enough or is it really so that
these options are lacking entirely? If they are not discussed but are possible, then it
is a communication issue. These individual and personal growth needs have to be
taken seriously by the employer and they should not be forgotten because of haste
or, even worse, ignorance.

79

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

The third notion regards the statement of My salary matches to my job performance
and skills. Near half of respondents disagreed with this. When considering what an
employer then needs to do, other than just raise the salary, the obvious answer
seems to be at least to communicate the grounds for pay and its different levels
better. Communication was an issue in many ways that definitely seems to require
more attention from the employer according to the respondents. Salary is a topic
that raises emotions. As the results of the interviews showed, employees talk with
others about salaries, their levels and what other companies offer. Hygiene factor or
not, it definitely seems to be important for ICT-professionals of this research.
Moreover, a poorly handled salary can lead to job dissatisfaction and ignite
turnover intentions. This statement is also related to statement of fairness in
corporate culture. Are the salary grounds justified, equal and understandable?
What needs to be achieved or done in order to get a raise? Are everyone treated in
the same manner? Mystique around salary questions certainly will not help
retaining professionals of high-demand in-house.
When reflecting the results to Hackman and Oldham’s Job characteristics model,
we find that experienced meaningfulness of work is quite high (only one disagreed
with this statement). Experienced responsibility for the outcomes of the work was
not actually measured in this survey as such but based on literature review
knowledge work generally is associated with greater autonomy and hence greater
responsibility experience. The respondents of survey mostly agreed their
responsibilities are in balance with their knowhow (only one disagreed).
Knowledge of actual results of work activities on the other hand represent
feedback from supervisor and this clearly needs improvement according
respondents (lack of this knowledge contradicts also expectancy theory). When we
also know that knowledge workers typically have strong growth needs, we can
conclude that if all of these factors were on a high level, then the likelihood of high
internal work motivation, high quality work performance and high satisfaction
with work would improve. Knowledge workers would be happy doing complex
tasks, if they only were well organized and managed.

80

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

If we examine the results in the light of Herzberg’s two-factor theory (1968), we
can say that mostly intrinsic motivators are driving the professionals, when it
comes to the answers of intention to stay. Some hygiene factors like coworker
relations seem to be working well with the participants of this study, while salary
levels on the other hand, clearly were causing some dissatisfaction. Motivating
factors appear divided. Respondents perceived a lack of advancement possibilities
but on the other hand they enjoy their work, regard it meaningful and find
satisfaction from work in itself. In the motivating factors lies big potential for the
employer to increase job satisfaction of these ICT-professionals. Results indicate
that by enhancing advancement possibilities and especially improving feedback
from results and giving more recognition for success, the employer can increase
feelings of achievement in the employee which not only affects positively to job
satisfaction but also empowers the employee and leads to feelings of
responsibility. This in turn can lead to even more increased feelings of achievement
after new feedback in a circular manner, and can act as reinforcement.
If examined in the light of Maslow’s need hierarchy theory (1943), the researcher
finds in some answers a need for safety to be the basis of continuing the current
employment relationship despite dissatisfaction. This is not completely surprising
given the recent staff reduction announcements, unemployment rates and globally
unstable environment. Certainly it goes along with Maslow’s theory that a person
needs to fulfill more basic level needs like continuous monthly income for food or
living before being able to think of e.g. the need for more creativity in work. It was
also reflected in answers the other way round, a person with sufficient salary and
low living costs demonstrated clear focus in more upper-level needs.
It is evidential that high levels of commitment and job satisfaction correlate with
willingness to stay in the organization’s service. This in turn is in relation to
corporate metrics, like productivity, profit, customer satisfaction, employee
turnover decrease, as well as the general health and well-being of the workforce. It
is thus, in the employer’s interest to organize the working conditions, the job and
career possibilities as such that they optimally support the employee needs. These

81

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

study results emphasize the importance of listening to your employees closely,
measuring systematically their job satisfaction and commitment and then
adjusting managerial actions to meet the needs.

6.2 Answering the research questions
In the following, according to the literature review and the results of this study, the
research questions are answered.
RQ1: What factors decrease most ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction in the
workplace?
These factors are non-functioning communication, too heavy workloads and
insufficient or misfocused management (including too much micromanagement).
RQ2: What factors increase most ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction in the
workplace?
These factors include appropriate and competitive salary & benefits, wellfunctioning and open communication as well as perceived fairness of the corporate
culture.
RQ3: What can the employer do to support ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction?
The following guidelines can be proposed:
1. Be more mindful and respecting towards different cultures
2. Take into account individual needs for attention and be interested
3. Clarify resourcing practices, who is doing what and when (not how)
4. Clarify the goals that are expected to be reached by the employee
5. Give more feedback and guidance to operative work
6. Inform more about advancement and career possibilities in the organization
7. Communicate the grounds for pay better

82

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

8. Give more recognition to employee achievements and give it fairly
There are certain things that should be considered when managing a knowledge
organization since it is different from managing traditional organization. Knowledge
workers need to know first their task well enough, ambiguous as it is. Leadership
needs to be shared, as no one person can effectively lead knowledge organization.
Knowledge workers themselves need to be empowered to take active control of
their work. Intrinsic motivators of each individual play key role in doing this. They
need autonomy in their work, as well as freedom to be innovative and to be able to
learn and develop continuously. Quality assessment of their
performance should be careful. Lastly, knowledge workers should be treated as
assets. They expect trust from management. They cannot be authoritatively
managed as subordinates but as equals among professionals. Instead of loyalty to a
superior, they should be loyal to a set of principles that are important in the
organization. In this last objective, it is essential that the values of the employee
match with the values of the employer organization.

6.3. Reliability
Bryman & Bell (2015) state that three of the most prominent criteria for the
evaluation of business and management research are reliability, replication and
validity. Reliability addresses are the results of a study repeatable. Particularly a
quantitative researcher is concerned with the question of the stability of a measure
and consistency of the results. (Bryman & Bell, 2015, p. 41, 49.) The researcher in
this thesis demonstrates reliability by properly displaying the research method,
data collection method as well as data analysis. The information sources are
appropriately quoted and referenced for others to make judgements.
Replicability is another important criterion for quality. In order for the study to be
replicable, the researcher has to explain his or her procedures in great detail
(Bryman & Bell, 2015). This has been the attempt also in this thesis.

83

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

Finally, validity is concerned with the integrity of conclusions of a study. Validity
means the study measures what it is supposed to measure (Bryman & Bell, 2015).
Validity principles have been taken into account doing this research. In addition,
all information represents the participants’ free views. All questions in the survey
questionnaire were presented both in Finnish and in English to ensure that
everyone understands correctly. Interviewees consented to their questions being
asked in English.

6.4 Limitations
The original idea was to gather a large amount of quantitative data on the subject
but because the qualitative method is better suited for gathering data of such a
subjective matter and also from a small group of participants, a qualitative part
was added to the study. Small sample size still persists as a limitation of this
research. In addition, because the process was delayed due to surprising difficulty
of finding participants, the time frame proved too tight to conduct a more thorough
or wider study and the actual empirical part was made with the resources
available at that time.
What has been omitted mostly from this research, are the personality factors that
influence job satisfaction. This would have proved to be too large a study area for
this thesis. Another subject that has been intentionally omitted is a closer
examination of burnout and its treatment. Moreover, this thesis aims to gather
hints of possible turnover intentions and their reasons, but because there are
naturally all kinds of reasons outside workplace, this research focuses only on
those areas that the employer can actually affect in the workplace.

6.5 Future research
This section is for future research suggestions. The researcher considers it
important that these results would be validated by conducting another survey with
a much larger sample. Another survey of similar research questions would likely

84

N. Hovi-Makkonen: Perceptions of knowledge work – ICT-professionals’ job satisfaction and turnover intentions

|

discover more details of the reasons for turnover intentions of ICT-professionals as
well as factors for their job satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
It would be very interesting to conduct a longitudinal study of the topic, similarly
as Amabile and Kramer in their study of Inner Work Life (2007). That would help
to understand better the contextual elements both vertically and horizontally and
the interconnections of these through time.
Thus far, the results of this thesis indicate similar areas of importance as in e.g. M.
Viljanen’s dissertation of HRM effectiveness in IT professions (2006).
Development, compensation and supervision are very important for ICTprofessionals, since research shows they have a strong need for personal growth.
The lowest evaluations have been in these studies given to financial compensation
and internal communication policies. The researcher here would suggest
additional research where the perceptions of management and perceptions of
personnel would be separately studied. This type of research could offer
knowledge of possible contradiction and its reasons.
