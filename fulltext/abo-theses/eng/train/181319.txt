ABSTRACT
There are many different paleoarchives, e.g. sediments, ice cores, tree-rings, speleothems
and corals. This master’s thesis focuses on the information receivable from ice cores. Well
preserved information of past precipitation can be found as natural archives in glaciers. This
is possible if the melting is negligible and if the precipitation during the year occurs as snow.
Annual snow layers will contain information of chemical impurities and stable water isotopes,
which can determine past climate and air pollution. Climate change reduces the volume of
glaciers all around the world, it is therefore important to conduct paleoclimatic research and
retrieve ice cores while the opportunity still exists.
Concentrations of major ions, and Black Carbon (BC) as well as the ratio of stable isotopes of
oxygen and hydrogen in water were analyzed for the first 26.5 m of an ice core from the
Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai. Some melting had occurred on the glacier, which led to
shifting or loss of some chemical signals. Clear signals for mineral dust-related species
(calcium, magnesium, sodium and chloride), anthropogenic-related species (nitrate, sulphate
and ammonium) and the biogenic and biomass burning related species (formate, oxalate and
ammonium) could still be seen. The dating was accomplished by comparing the records with
another ice core drilled from the Belukha glacier in 2001. One distinct dust peak and
seasonally varying signals proved to be significant for dating. This part of the ice core
extended back to year 1984 and a good agreement could be made between the two ice cores
from Belukha. Most of the analyzed ions showed a decreasing trend in concentration from
1984 to 2018. An exception was the concentrations for methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and
potassium. The increase in MSA (sea-ice proxy) was believed to be due to melting of ice in
the Arctic Ocean. The increase in potassium concentrations was not easily explained.
The mean δ18O value (-13.09‰) was considered a high value for the elevation of 4506 m a.s.l.,
this indicated lack of strong winter minima. The deuterium-excess (d-excess) value was
higher during the winter months and lower during the summer months, which suggested an
input of water vapor from internal sources during the winter and from external sources
during the summer. One dust layer was visually observed in the ice core; this dust event
happened in 2006 and the increased calcium and magnesium concentration at this depth
confirmed the dust event.

1 INTRODUCTION
The cryosphere, i.e., glaciers, snow, permafrost and other ice, covers 10% of the Earth’s
surface. Glaciers are built up by deposition of countless layers of snow over a period of
thousands of years. These glaciers are a unique source of information about past atmospheric
conditions. Ice cores drilled from glaciers are excellent archives for understanding the past
environmental and climatic changes. Different information can be obtained, depending on
the location of the glacier. Polar ice cores, e.g. those extracted from Antarctica and
Greenland, contain information at a global scale, whereas ice cores from low- and midlatitudes, e.g. the European Alps and the Asian High Mountains, contain information about
the local climate. Possible information that can be extracted from polar ice cores are e.g.
signals of past temperatures, greenhouse gases, precipitation and concentration of aerosols.
The focus in this thesis will be on the low- and mid-latitude glaciers, not on the polar ice.
Advantages with the low- and mid-latitude glaciers are that they show more precise records
of local climate, which is important since a large part of the Earth´s population lives in these
regions. It is also possible to extract information about the variations of the climate from
both anthropogenic and natural factors from these glaciers. Industries and cities often emit
short-lived atmospheric species, which can be extracted from low- and mid-latitude glaciers.
The precipitation is usually high in these regions, which establishes records with high
resolution. The low- and mid-latitudes also enable analysis of meteorological processes, e.g.,
by analyzing the dust depositions from different deserts (Garzonio, et al., 2017).
It is important to analyze glaciers when the opportunity still exists. The recent global warming
has led to retreatment of low- and mid-latitude glaciers. It is estimated that 80% of the glacier
mass of smaller glaciers in, e.g., the European Alps and North Asia, will be melted by year
2100. This estimation is made under the warming scenario called RCP8.5, which is the
estimated scenario if no efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are made (IPCC, 2019).
Melting of glaciers will make it impossible to obtain important paleoclimatic records. The
melting of glaciers is causing us to lose a part of our planet’s history (Fig. 1.). It is, therefore,
urgent for us to preserve as many ice cores as possible from selected glaciers around the
world. The global warming sets a strict race against the time to collect ice cores from
endangered glaciers. To act on this emergency the Ice Memory project was created. The goal
for this international project is to create a global ice archive sanctuary for ice core records
recovered from all around the world. The ice cores will be stored in a perennial subsurface

storage space in Antarctica. The ice cores will be saved for future generations to analyze
(Bronex, et al., 2020; Ice Memory, 2020). The biomass, peatlands and soil in Siberia are one
of the largest reservoirs of terrestrial carbon in the world (Olivier, et al., 2006). The estimated
temperature increase for northern Asia within the current climate change scenario (IPCC,
2014), poses a major threat. Massive amounts of terrestrial carbon could be released by
forest fires due to increased temperature.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Stable water isotopes
The Danish paleoclimatologist Willi Dansgaard (1922 – 2011) discovered that past
temperatures could be reconstructed by analyzing stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen
found in glaciers (Rapp, 2012). There are three naturally occurring stable isotopes of oxygen
(16O, 17O and 18O) and two naturally occurring stable isotopes of hydrogen (1H and D). This
leads to four different isotopologues of water, i.e. molecules with varying isotopic
composition. The light isotopologue H216O is the most abundant isotopologue, the heavier
isotopologues are H1D16O, H217O and H218O. These isotopologues of water are with a common
name called stable water isotopes (SWI). Two of these SWI, H218O and HD16O, are naturally
occurring tracers and used in paleoclimatology research (Beria, et al., 2018). The use of 17O
as a natural tracer has increased recently (Landais, et al., 2008); however,

17

O is not

considered further, since it was not used as a tracer in this research. In the past, SWI (H218O
and HD16O) were expressed as ppm, but they are now expressed as δ notation with the unit
per mil (‰). The isotopic composition of water can be determined with the help of the
international standard reference, i.e. the Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). The
reference value is provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The isotopic
composition is expressed as delta notation (δ), which is the deviation from the ratio (R) of
18

O/16O or D/1H of a sample from the standard reference SMOW (see Equation 1.) (Rapp,

2012).

Equation 1. The definition of δ18O and δD is shown. R sample represents the 18O/16O fractionation for δ18O
and D/H fractionation for δD. R standard represents the SMOW value.

2.2 Isotopic fractionation
Isotopic fractionation occurs during each phase change, i.e. stable isotopes are enriched in
one phase and depleted in another. The two mass-dependent effects that influence the
fractionation behavior of the SWI are called the equilibrium effects. The diffusion velocity is
slower for the heavier isotopologues, because of the heavier weight. The heavier
isotopologues prefer phases with stronger bonds (solid > liquid > vapor), because of the
larger mass. The evaporated water will have a lower δ18O-value, i.e. will be depleted in

3

Viola Wilson

___________________________________________________________________________
heavier isotopologues, since they have a lower tendency to evaporate. The air parcel cools
down when it moves towards the pole (Fig. 2.). When the air parcel reaches the Dew point,
it will start to condensate. This means that the δ18O-value of the air parcel will decrease
further when it becomes colder and more water will condensate out of it. The temperature
can be determined from the δ18O or the δD, since the magnitude of the enrichment of heavier
isotopes is temperature dependent. Precipitation during warmer periods (summer) is less
depleted compared to precipitation during colder periods (Rapp, 2012).

Fig. 2. Isotopic fractionation, δ-values for different reservoirs, figure from (Rapp, 2012).

The deuterium excess (d-excess) is used to identify the precipitation source regions. Most of
the global precipitation originates from the oceans. Some of the moisture in the atmosphere
is recycled from other sources than the ocean. Water can evaporate from lakes and soils, but
also from plant transpiration. The relative mass difference of the hydrogen isotopes is eight
times bigger than the relative mass difference of the oxygen isotopes. That is why δ18O is
multiplied by eight (see Equation 2.). The d-excess is the deviation of a water sample from
the global meteoric water line. The d-excess is affected by the isotopic fractionation at the
evaporation source and it correlates with the temperature and relative humidity.

2.3 Glaciers as natural archives
The transition from snow to ice, i.e. dry snow metamorphosis, occurs due to mechanical
packing and plastic deformation. The density increases when more snow accumulates on the
surface and the material becomes more compressed. The compression forces the snow to
recrystallize and form grains. With time, these grains become similar in size and larger. At a
certain depth below surface, e.g. at around 50 m depth for high-altitude glaciers, the so-

called firn grains sinter and form glacier ice, which is not porous anymore. Year by year snow
accumulation is added in the accumulation area of the glacier, which turns into distinct layers.
For this to be possible, the yearly precipitation needs to be snow and melting needs to be
negligible. These conditions can usually be found at high elevations, around 4000 m a.s.l.
(Rapp, 2012).
Much information can be obtained from the ice, it is a unique archive of paleo-atmospheric
conditions and paleoclimate. Information about atmospheric composition, solar activity,
volcanism, biomass burning, dustiness and past temperatures can be obtained (Rapp, 2012).
Trace species can also be determined, they originate from natural or anthropogenic sources.
The natural sources include sea spray, volcanic eruptions and mineral dust. The
anthropogenic sources include agriculture, energy production, traffic and fossil fuel
combustion (Schwikowski, et al., 2010). Some species can be used as tracers for a specific
source; chloride and sodium from sea salt, calcium and magnesium from dust, sulphate,
nitrate and ammonium from anthropogenic sources, ammonium and formate from biomass
burning. The oldest ice core ever retrieved is 2.7 million years old from Allan Hills, Antarctica.
This ice core contains information about the Earth’s atmosphere from when the ice age
began. The Allan Hills is near the coast, where the glacial flow brings older ice to the surface.
The oldest ice core drilled from the mainland of Antarctica (Dome C) is ∼800,000 years old.
This core contained a continuous record, in contrast to the one from Allan Hills which just
gave access to an old, but short time scale. The deepest part of the ice cores from the
mainland can be affected by melt due to heat from the bedrock (Voosen, 2017).
Among the trace species, BC particles have received a lot of attention recently. They are
formed by incomplete combustion of carbonaceous matter, i.e. biomass and fossil fuel. Due
to their unique properties, i.e. low chemical activity, strongly light-absorbing and highly
refractory, BC particles affect the Earth’s radiative budget. BC contributes to the global
warming by reducing the albedo of snow, directly absorbing sunlight in the atmosphere and
modifying cloud properties (Osmont, et al., 2018). Greenhouse gases are the largest
contributor to global warming, but BC is believed to be the second largest (Dutkiewicz, et al.,
2014). The European Union was among the first which worked to reduce emission of air
pollutants. Studies have shown that BC particles can cause health problems, e.g. respiratory
and cardiovascular diseases. BC particles can also introduce toxins, e.g., heavy metals and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into the human body, since they operate as universal
carriers (Sun, et al., 2020). It is highly important to study BC records from ice cores to better

5

understand the role BC particles play in the atmosphere. The recommendation to use the
term rBC (refractory black carbon) for samples analyzed with laser-induced incandescence
will hereafter be followed (Petzold, et al., 2013).

2.4 Ice core dating
Ice cores contain much information about the past climate, but without the age knowledge
at each depth, the information has little value. To establish the most accurate age knowledge
of an ice core, a combination of several different techniques is usually used. The uncertainty
of the dating increases with the age of the ice core, i.e. the accuracy for recent periods is very
good but becomes more uncertain further back in time. The determination of the timescale
can become difficult if irregular deposition of precipitation occurs. The appropriate dating
method used for ice cores depends on the accuracy requirements and on the length (i.e. age)
of the ice core (Eichler, et al., 2000).

2.4.1 Seasonally varying signals
Dating with seasonally varying signals for ice cores is a very precise method, the principle is
the same as counting annual rings on trees. The annual layers in ice cores can be up to several
meters at the top but only a few centimeters further down in the ice core. The annual signals
can be more difficult to identify further down in the glacier, due to layer thinning. Annual
layers become thinner with depth, due to gravity that causes the ice to flow from the
accumulation area to the ablation zones. The bedrock causes shearing and folding of the ice,
which can lead to stratigraphic disturbance of the layers. The thinning of the ice and the
stratigraphic disturbance must be considered when dating an ice core (Rapp, 2012).
One example of a seasonally varying signal is the isotopic ratio 18O/16O of water. This isotopic
ratio is dependent on the condensation temperature, which is seasonally dependent. This
hydrological cycle causes higher δ18O values during summer precipitation and vice versa for
winter precipitation. Another good seasonally varying signal is the ammonium concentration.
This is one of the analyzed ions that show the most pronounced seasonal variations. The
concentration for NH4+ is significantly higher in precipitation during summer months. This is
because the precursor for NH4+ is NH3, which is mainly emitted during summer months from
agricultural emissions (90%), i.e. fertilizers and livestock excreta. The vertical transport of air
masses and pollutants from emission sources to high altitudes is significantly larger during
summer months (Eichler, et al., 2000).

2.4.2 Radioactive decay
Ice cores can be dated with environmental radionuclides, an example of which is 210Pb dating.
It was G. Cozaz in the early 1960s who first used 210Pb to date ice cores. The most abundant
isotope of uranium is 238U, which is found at a level of ∼1.7 ppm in the Earth’s continental
crust. 238U (half-life 4.6 x 109 years) decays into the 226Ra (half-life 1622 years) which, in turn,
decays into the short-lived radioactive isotope 222Rn, which is a noble gas (half-life 3.8 days).
This gas is emanated from the soil into the atmosphere, where transportation in the lower
222

troposphere occurs.

Rn decays to several short-lived heavy metal intermediate nuclides

(half-life less than 30 min) that attach to aerosols in the atmosphere. Thereafter is the radio
nuclide 210Pb formed (half-life 22.3 years), which usually remains around two weeks in the
atmosphere before deposition on the Earth’s surface, e.g., on a glacier with precipitation.
210

Pb decays via the short-lived intermediate nuclides 210Bi (half-life 5 days) and 210Po (half-

life 138 days) to the stable end product of the 238U decay chain 206Pb (Fig. 3). 210Pb in ice can
be measured via the decay of

210

Po, and since the concentration of

210

Pb in the air is well

monitored, it can be used to determine age-depth scale for the ice core. The maximum dating
time range is determined from the radioactive isotope 210Pb half-life, the accessibility is ∼150
years (Gäggeler, et al., 2020).

Fig. 3. Overview of the 238U-206Pb decay chain, modified from (Gäggeler, et al., 2017).

For this dating method, some assumptions need to be taken into consideration. The
concentration of

210

Pb in precipitation is believed to be constant during the investigated

timeline. Melting of the ice does not transport the 210Pb containing particles in the ice. The
concentration of

226

Ra in the ice is negligible and no additional

222

Rn diffuses from the

atmosphere to the glacier (Gäggeler, et al., 2017).

2.4.3 Stratigraphic markers
Stratigraphic markers contain unusually high concentrations of debris in ice cores at certain
depths (i.e., a known age). The debris originates from well-known events, creating so-called
reference horizons. Reference horizons can originate from increased concentration of
pollutants from e.g., forest fires, desert dust, anthropogenic factors and volcanic eruptions

7

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
(Eichler, et al., 2000). Examples of some well-known reference horizons are increased
sulphate concentrations in the ice due to the Mount Katmai volcanic eruption in Alaska in
1912 and the Tambora volcanic eruption in Indonesia in 1815/1816 (Henderson, et al., 2006).
Another example is the varying sulfur dioxide emissions in Kazakhstan and Siberia. A sharp
increase in sulphate concentration can be seen in the 1970s followed by a decrease in the
1980s due to political and economic crises when coal was replaced with gas. In the 1950s, an
increase in ammonium concentration is seen because of the population inflow in southern
Siberia (increased agricultural activity). The increased use of fertilizers and traffic growth is
noticeable as an increase in the nitrate concentrations starting from the 1960s. The last
example is the nitrate peak in 1908 from the mysterious Tunguska event in Russia (Olivier, et
al., 2006).
Radioactive debris from certain events is commonly used as reference horizons. One example
is the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 and the nuclear weapon testing in the
1950s and 1960s, all of which released huge amounts of 137Cs into the atmosphere. 137Cs is a
long-lived radioactive isotope originating from nuclear reaction. This radioactive isotope and
other nuclear debris can be absorbed onto aerosol particles and, therefore, be detected in
ice cores. Tritium (3H) exists naturally in the atmosphere, but in a much lower concentration
compared to hydrogen and deuterium. 3H is produced naturally in the atmosphere in a
reaction with oxygen, nitrogen and high-energy cosmic rays. It reacts with water molecules
in the atmosphere and reaches the glaciers as precipitation. There are, however,
anthropogenic origins for 3H as well. Anthropogenic 3H was released with the world’s first
thermonuclear explosion in 1951. The concentration of 3H increased until the Test Ban Treaty
was signed in 1963 by the Soviet Union and the United States. The 3H peak in 1963 is
commonly used as a stratigraphic marker in ice core dating (Eichler, et al., 2000).

2.5 Altai Mountains
The site selection for obtainment of ice cores from mid- and low-latitude glacier is important.
To obtain interpretable records, some important criteria need to be fulfilled when choosing
a suitable glacier. It is important to consider the climatic variables on the site, e.g. wind
exposure and accumulation rate, when choosing a suitable drilling site. The glacial thickness
needs to be sufficient to ensure long-term records. The glacial thickness depends on the input
of annual snow accumulation but also on the snow output due to wind erosion. One also
needs to consider the physical and morphological features on the site, e.g. melting, and flow

8

Viola Wilson

velocity. Glacial flow can lead to disruptions in annual layers; relatively flat surface
topography is therefore optimal. To minimize disruptions of meltwater percolations high
elevation sites can be used. One last consideration is the accessibility of the site, usually
above 4 000 m a.s.l. (Garzonio, et al., 2017).
Relatively few paleo-climatic records have to this date been obtained from the Altai
Mountains. The paleo-climatic information obtained from the Altai is, however, of much
interest. It is the location of the Altai Mountains that makes them interesting for
paleoclimatology research. This location demonstrates a high degree in continentality, with
high seasonal temperature variations from, -47 °C in winter to +41 °C in summer. It is located
in Central Asia in the north-western periphery on the boarders between China, Kazakhstan,
Mongolia and Russia (Fig. 4.). The Altai Mountain range extends from the Russian Altai in the
north-west to the Gobi Desert in the south-east. The rivers Irtysh, Yenisei and Ob receive
their main water input from the Altai mountain range. The Altai massif is 1500 km long and
varies from 600 to 100 km from north to south. Belukha Mountain (4 506 m a.s.l.) is the
highest peak in the Altai Mountains (Malygina, et al., 2017).
The snow accumulation in the Altai region derives mainly from an external marine source
(67%), the rest derives from an internal moisture source. The main marine source is the
Atlantic Ocean (56%), from where moisture is evaporated and transported with the
Westerlies to the Altai region. The internal source is Central Asia, which is a major
precipitation source during summer. The snow accumulation rate is higher during summer
for both internal and external moisture sources. The air transport is prevented by the Siberian
High during the winter, when the conditions are dry and cold. (Aizen, et al., 2006). The Altai
Mountain functions as a barrier, which creates a north-west to south-east precipitation
gradient. The annual precipitation on the north-west side is 400 to 600 mm, whereas the
annual precipitation on the south-east side is ∼100 mm (Klinge, et al., 2003).

On the right side, Altai Mountains is marked with a red dot. It can also be seen that the Altai Mountains is inbetween the arid region of Central Asia and the vast Siberian forest (Eichler, et al., 2009b).

2.5.1 Belukha ice core 2001
Previous paleoclimatology research has been conducted by Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in
the Siberian Altai. The first deep ice core drilled from the Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai
(4062 m a.s.l., 49°48’26.3’’N, 86°34’42.8’’E), by PSI, was drilled in July 2001 (Olivier, et al.,
2006). The recovered ice core was 139 m long and a total of 3615 samples were obtained.
The retraceable period covered by the ice core extended to 1250 AD. The inner part of the
ice core was used to analyze the following cations Na+, NH4 +, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and the following
anions Cl-, NO3- , SO42-, HCOO-. The outer part of the ice core was used for 3H, 210Pb and δ18O
analyses. 3H and 210Pb were used to date the ice core and δ18O for determining the amount
of precipitation and temperature. The average δ18O value was 12%, which is considered
relatively high. The mean annual accumulation rate was calculated to be 0.56 m water
equivalent (w. eq.) (Eichler, et al., 2009a). A back-trajectory analysis for the air transport to
the Altai region during summer shows from where the air pollution originates. In the backtrajectories for the summer months of 1991 to 2000, it can be seen that the territory of the
Former Soviet Union (FSU) is the main area of origin (Fig. 5.). Despite the remoteness of the
Belukha Mountain, traces of anthropogenic impacts were seen in the form of ammonium,
sulfate and nitrate. Differences in the ion concentration between Belukha and the Swiss Alps
could be seen for ammonium and formate. This indicated enhanced concentrations from
biogenic emissions from the Siberian forest. Ice lenses up to 20 cm thickness were observed,
which indicated melting and refreezing during warm periods (Olivier, et al., 2019).

To the right is the Belukha Mountain seen from the Ak-kem lake, photograph taken by Patrick Ginot. Both ice
cores, the one drilled in 2001 and the one drilled in 2018, were recovered from the saddle between the east
and west summit (49°48’N, 86°34’E) (Eichler, et al., 2009c).

2.5.2 Reason for drilling B18
Some questions where left unanswered when the Belukha ice core 2001 (B01) was analyzed.
One of the questions left was the recent development of former Soviet Union (FSU) heavy
metal emissions. Heavy metals pollute the atmosphere, particularly Pb, which can have
devastating effects on human health. Pb pollution is worldwide quite well documented,
however, some controversy can be seen regarding the existing Pb records for the FSU. Official
reports by HELCOM (intergovernmental organization) estimate a decrease in the Pb emission
for the period 1990 to 2007 (Gusev, 2009). An increase of the Pb concentrations during the
1990s was seen in an ice core obtained from the Tian Shen. Tian Shen is a mountain range
also located in central Asia and this ice core is strongly influenced by emissions from China
and FSU (Grigholm, et al., 2016). Because of the location of the Belukha glacier, the ice core
can be used to study the recent changes in metal pollution from FSU. B18 will also be used
to reconstruct the pre-industrial to industrial changes of organic aerosols. Atmospheric
aerosols affect the climate directly and indirectly: directly by absorbing and scattering the
radiation and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei, which affects the outgoing
and incoming solar radiation. The effect aerosols have on the climate is still poorly
understood, mainly because of the lack of knowledge about the number of particles in the
natural atmosphere before the high increase due to anthropogenic pollution.

2.5.3 Acquisition of Belukha ice core 2018
The second expedition to Belukha took place in May – June 2018. The equipment was
brought up with the help of a helicopter. The thickness of the glacier at the drilling site was
already determined in 2001, this was done with the help of a radar. The radar signal
penetrates through the ice and is reflected back to the surface by the bedrock. The ice cores
were collected using an electromechanical ice core drill. The drill itself is 257 cm long and
attached to a 200 m long cable. The ice cores were obtained as cylinders with a diameter ∼8
cm and length ∼70 cm. The drilling at the first site had to stop at a depth of 109 m, because
no drilling chips were seen, suggesting the presence of a subsurface crevasse. The drill was
packed up and reassembled at another location (49°48'27.7''N, 86°34'46.5''E, 4055 m asl.),
where the second ice core was drilled. This time the bedrock was reached, at a depth of 163
m. The ice cores were carefully put in polyethylene tubes, labelled and put in cardboard
boxes with styrofoam insulation. The ice cores filled up 21 cardboard boxes, which were
transported in a frozen condition to Switzerland. The ice cores were stored in a freezer facility
in Möhlin, Switzerland, due to limited space at the cold room at PSI.

3 AIM OF THIS WORK
As previously mentioned, research has already been conducted on ice cores from the Belukha
glacier in the Siberian Altai. This master’s thesis is based on a ten-week internship at PSI. The
internship was involved with the ongoing research of the Belukha ice core drilled in 2018.
The aim of this internship and therefore also of this master’s thesis, was to learn how
information about past air temperature, atmospheric composition, precipitation and wind
pattern can be obtained from ice cores.
To achieve this, the upper part of the Belukha ice core was analyzed with the following
methods, Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), Wavelength-Scanned Cavity Ring – Down
Infrared Spectroscopy (WS - CRDIS) and ion chromatography (IC). SP2 was used to analyze
black carbon concentration, WS – CRDIS was used to analyze SWI and IC was used to analyze
ion concentrations. Before these analyses could begin, the ice core needed to be cut into
suitable sample pieces, which was performed in a -20 °C cold room.
An important part of this work was to date the ice core based on the information obtained
from the analyses. To achieve this, knowledge of the Ice Core Dating software was necessary.
Data from B01 was also available to help with the dating of the Belukha ice core 2018 (B18).
This data could be used since there should be an overlap between the two ice cores. Black
carbon concentration for the B01 was not measured, so data from another nearby glacier,
Tsambagarav, was used instead.
The information obtained from the Belukha ice core will be used to determine recent changes
in temperature and pollution in the Siberian Altai. The overall aim is to understand the
climate response due to both natural and anthropogenic factors, to understand the climate
dynamics in the past and try to predict future changes in the climate. The ice core record
from 2001 will also be updated.

4 METHODS
4.1 Ion Chromatography
Ion Chromatography (IC) can be used to separate dissolved ions, i.e. cations and anions in a
liquid solution. The IC (Metrohm 850 Professional IC) was used combined with an 872
Extension Module and an autosampler (858 Professional Sample Processor). This analytical
technique consists of a liquid phase (the eluent) and a solid stationary phase. The stationary
phase is inside of a column through which an eluent is continuously passed, with the help of
a pump. The sample is injected and will travel together with the eluent to the column. The
ions travel through the column with velocity, which depends on the ion affinity to the
stationary phase. A conductivity detector is placed at the end of the column, and the
concentration of the ions is plotted against the time in a graph that is called a chromatogram
(Fig. 6.). The eluent used for the cations were 2.8 mM HNO3. The most efficient way to
separate the anions, was first to use an eluent with a lower concentration (1.5 mM Na2CO3/
0.3 mM NaHCO3) followed by an eluent with a higher concentration (8 mM Na2CO3/ 1.7 mM
NaHCO3). An autosampler was used to inject the samples automatically (Haddad, et al., 1990).
The needle in the autosampler was washed with ultrapure water before every sample
analysis. Ultrapure water is defined by > 18 MΩ cm resistance. One measurement for cations
and anions was done for each sample.

Fig. 6. Schematic image of the IC principle. It shows the eluent delivery, the sample injection, the separation in
the column and the detection that produces the chromatogram.

4.2 Wavelength-Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Infrared Spectroscopy
Wavelength-Scanned Cavity Ring-Down Infrared Spectroscopy (WS-CRDS) is a highly sensitive
laser-based absorption spectroscopy method. A laser diode enters the cavity, where a
minimum of two highly reflective mirrors are located. The instrument used for this
experiment was the Picarro L2140-i water analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, Ca, USA) for
isotopes and WS-CRDS will hereafter be referred to as Picarro. Picarro uses three highly
reflective mirrors in the cavity, to enable the light wave to travel a longer distance. The laser
14

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
is turned on so that the cavity can be filled with the laser light. When the laser is turned off,
the light inside the cavity will continue to bounce between the reflective mirrors. The light
intensity will decrease to zero since the mirrors do not reflect 100% of the light. This decay is
called the “ring-down” and it is measured by a photodetector. The Picarro has a cavity of 25
cm, which enables the laser light to travel over 20 km. The ring-down time is measured and
only based on the reflectivity of the mirrors if the cavity is empty. The sample is vaporized
and inserted into the cavity. The gaseous samples will absorb some of the laser light, which
will accelerate the ring-down. The ring-down time for the empty cavity is then compared to
the ring-down time for the cavity with gaseous sample, this can be seen in Fig. 7. The time
for the gaseous sample will be shorter due to absorption of the laser light by the sample.
(Berden, et al., 2000; Picarro, 2021). The needle in the autosampler was washed with
ultrapure water before every analysis. Six measurements were obtained from every sample,
the first three were not used, to minimize the risk of contamination.

Fig. 7. Above is a diagram of the ring – down time with and without a sample, modified from (Berden, et al.
2000). Below is a schematic image of the Picarro, modified from (Picarro, 2021).

4.3 Single Particle Soot Photometer
Black carbon particle size and mass can be detected with the Single Particle Soot Photometer
(SP2). The SP2 (Droplet Measurement Technology, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) was used
combined with an APEX-Q jet nebulizer system (High Sensitivity Sample Introduction System,
Elemental Scientific Inc., Omaha, NE, USA). The sample is first nebulized and the droplets
dried, the laser-induced incandescence of a particle determines the particles boiling point,

15

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
which can be used to determine the particle composition. The SP2 includes a diode-pumped
neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser and four detectors. Two of the detectors
are optical detectors containing avalanche photodiodes (APD) and the other two detectors
are incandescence detectors. The aerosols from the sample crosses the laser beam produced
by the laser crystal in a perpendicular direction (Fig. 8.). The aerosols scatter light, which is
detected by the APD. There are two filters that select specific wavelengths, i.e. 630 to 800
nm and 350 to 800 nm. A voltage signal is then produced from the APD, which is proportional
to the scattering intensity. The light scatter is used to determine the size of BC particles.
Particles with light absorbing material will be heated, absorbing the laser until they
incandesce. The emitted light wavelengths will be proportional to the incandescence
temperature, this light is collected by the incandescence detectors. The mass of the particle
can be determined from the measured incandescence (Gao, et al., 2007; Baumgardner, et al.,
2004).

Fig. 8. Above is a schematic image on the SP2 detection (Gao, et al., 2007) and below is a schematic figure of
the SP2 principle.

5 EXPERIMENTAL PART
For this laboratory work, cleanliness and preparation were of utmost importance to reduce
the risk of contamination. The experimental parts were therefore conducted with “superclean gloves”. Different gloves were examined to see which ones were the cleanest to work
with, i.e. the gloves that released the lowest amount of ions (analyzed with IC). It turned out
that the polyethylene gloves from Coop, which is a retail and wholesale company in
Switzerland, were the cleanest. A considerable amount of preparation was needed before
the actual ice core cutting and analysis could begin.

5.1 Preparations and ice cutting
New 50 ml polypropylene vials with lids were used for the analysis of major ions, BC and trace
elements and polyethylenterephthalate (PET) jars with lids were used for the organic carbon
(OC) measurements. The term OC will from now on refer to both particulate organic carbon
(POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The vials and jars were washed with ultrapure
water since ultrapure water is purified and to a high degree deionized water. Containers with
the vials and lids were filled with ultrapure water and, thereafter, shaken carefully to remove
any additional air. Ultrapure water was then added again until the containers were
completely full. The vials and lids were soaked in the ultrapure water for 24 h, before the
ultrapure water was refilled. This process was repeated five times for all containers.
Thereafter, the vials and the lids were dried in an oven for 24 h at 60 °C. The vials were
labelled with a printed sticker containing all the necessary information. Different colors were
used for the vial racks to minimize the risk of mix-up between the different samples.
Cutting schemes were calculated and designed depending on the analysis method and the
density of the ice core. Five ice cores could usually be cut with the same cutting scheme, after
which the increase in density had to be considered. The aim when calculating and designing
a cutting scheme was to obtain enough ice for the analysis without wasting any of the ice
core, since it is expensive to obtain. The minimum volume of sample needed for the OC
analysis corresponds to about 250 ml. The OC samples had to be cleaned with ultrapure
water before the measurements; therefore, the largest pieces of ice were selected to
minimize ice loss. The volume of ice needed for the IC and BC analysis had to correspond to
6 ml melted sample. Otherwise, the concentrations would be too small to determine (see
Equation 3.-4. and Fig. 9). The higher the density was, the less ice volume was needed to

17

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
achieve the minimum mass and volume of melted sample required. The sample resolution
for IC and BC samples was usually around 8 cm.

orange numbers highlight the order of the cuts. The right side shows the resolution cut (i.e. the length of the
sample). See also Fig. 11.

The ice cores were cut in a cold room at a temperature of -20°C. It is of utmost importance
that the cold room is clean. The light table was cleaned three times with ethanol. Regular
paper towel was used the first two times and a special polyester tissue, designed for use in
super-clean rooms was used the third time. The plexiglas saw table and the stainless-steel
band saw blades were thoroughly cleaned with acetone three times, always using the special
polyester tissue. This cleaning process was performed before and after each cutting session.
The instruments were also cleaned in-between every ice core. The reason for using pure
ethanol and pure acetone is because of their good miscibility with water and organic
compounds. They can be used in the cold room since their freezing points are -114.1 °C and
-95 °C, respectively. Blank ice was used to check that the cutting scheme was functional and
that the cold room and instruments were clean. To produce the blank ice, plastic containers
were washed and filled with ultrapure water. The containers had to be stored in the cold
room for two days to become fully frozen. The blank ice was cut at multiple stages of the
process; it was first cut before the ice cores, then after the ice cores were cut and, lastly,
after the saw table was cleaned. The length, diameter and mass of the ice core were
measured and noted on a core sheet. Photographs were taken, two with the ceiling light on
and two with the ceiling light off to better visualize the ice lenses (see Fig. 10.)

off. Photographs taken by Petr Nalivaika.

The outer part of the ice core was removed to avoid any possible contamination from the
drilling and the handling of the ice core. This outer part was approximately 0.2 cm thick.
Broken edges were also decontaminated in the same way. The upperpart of the ice core was
first cut, to keep the chronological order intact. The risk of mix-up could be reduced by always
cutting and placing the pieces in the same way. The ice cores at the top consisted of mostly
of firn, which made them more breakable. The cut ice samples were placed in respective vial
or jar and stored in the cold room until measurements were carried out. The rest of the ice
core was placed inside the ice core tube again and stored in the cardboard boxes for future
analyses.

stored for future analysis. The middle photograph illustrates the process of ice cutting. The right photograph

5.2 Analysis of major ions
The first 39 ice cores were cut, which resulted in 334 samples for the IC, SWI and BC analyses.
This work will not focus on the OC or ICP-MS part anymore because of the time limit for this
master’s thesis. N2 gas was blown for 20 s on the frozen IC samples, to reduce the risk of
contamination of the sample with laboratory air. The N2 gas creates a protective layer on the
sample, since it replaces the laboratory air. Around 48 samples were melted (at room
temperature) at a time, which is approximately the number that can be analyzed in 24 h.
Before the IC samples were analyzed, 1 ml of the IC samples was pipetted into a 2 ml labelled
vial for the SWI analyses. A new pipette tip was cleaned three times with ultrapure water
before the sample was pipetted. The lids were unscrewed from the IC vials and a layer of
aluminum foil was placed on the top. Thereafter, the vials were placed in the IC autosampler
and measured. The analyzed cations were sodium (Na+), ammonium (NH4+), potassium (K+),
magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+). The anions analyzed were fluoride (F-), acetate (OAc-),
formate (HCOO-), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-), sulphate (SO42-)
and oxalate (C2O42-). Ultrapure water was used to wash the sampler needle in-between every
sample. A snow sample from Jungfraujoch with known ion concentrations was measured
randomly in-between samples. The sample from Jungfraujoch functioned as a control sample,
to check that the values were correct. Before the samples were removed from the autosampler, the concentration for every ion was checked. Their detection limits (LOD) are given
in Table 1. If the measured ion value was higher than the maximum value for the standards,
the sample had to be re-measured. The sample was then diluted by a factor of two, which
means that their concentrations were lowered by 50%.

Some IC samples had to be re-measured due to too high concentration values. This only
happened for formate and sulphate (see Appendix A). The data received from the IC analysis
was calibrated with the standards and integrated manually for every sample. The mean value
for the ions in the ultrapure water (i.e. the ionic background) was calculated and then
subtracted from respective ion-sample value to obtain the correct value for the samples.

5.3 SWI data analysis
Three different standards were used for the SWI analysis. One was ultrapure water from the
lab and the others were melted snow samples from Rueras and Scuol, respectively. Snow
samples from these two mountains in Switzerland have been analyzed multiple times at PSI
and have a known stable isotope composition. These SWI standards cover the range of δ18O
from -10 to -25 ‰, which is within the range for the Belukha ice core samples. Ultrapure
water was used to wash the needle in-between every sample. The sample amount needed
for one measurement was 10 µL melted ice. One sample was in total measured six times, the
first three measurements were discarded to avoid contamination from previous samples, i.e.
the memory effect. In the end, the mean value from the last three samples were used, unless
some of the values deviated too much, in that case, an exception could be made and one of
the first three measured values could be used instead. These exceptions had to be made if
the standard deviation for δ18O exceeded 0.1‰ or if the standard deviation for δH exceeded
0.5‰. The standard deviation values were obtained from the uncertainty of measurements
from the IAEA certified standard. The need to re-measure a sample arouse if the mean value
of H2O was less than 17000 ppm or more than 23000 ppm. Not enough sample was injected
if the value was below 17000 ppm and too much sample was injected if the value was above
23000 ppm. Both the δ18O and the δD values are depending on the injected H2O content. The
re-measured samples can be seen in Table 2.
Table 2. The mean H2O values and limits obtained from the stable water isotope measurements. The measured
values and re-measured values are shown as the average values from the six measurements that were
conducted for each sample.

Sample 91 and 244 were technically inside the range, but it was decided to remeasure the
samples, since the values for the two following (i.e., sample 92 and 245) samples were
outside the limits for the mean H2O value. Samples 287 and 288 were remeasured due to
human error in the lab. The values for the samples were calibrated from the standards, and
drift corrections were made for both the δ18O and the δD values. The drift corrected values
for the standards were used due to showing more exact values. The deuterium excess was
also calculated by using Equation 2 in section 2.1.

5.4 BC analysis
The black carbon samples were melted in room temperature sonication bath. The duration
of the sonication was noted. The BC instrument measured particles until the limit of 1000
particles was reached. The number of BC particles will decrease by 4% to 16% in 6h when the
sample has melted, it is therefore difficult to obtain a correct value through a remeasurement
(Osmont, et al., 2018). The system was automatically cleaned before the measurements
began. All standards were measured before the BC sample measurements began. One
randomly picked standard was measured in-between a set of 20 BC samples. The needle was
cleaned with ultrapure water between every measurement. Flow controls were done
occasionally to check that everything was working correctly (see Equation 4.). A suitable flow
rate was ∼0.3 ml/min. Certain BC samples were remeasured due to low values, which could
indicate a problem with the flow rate. Although, it could just be a sample with a naturally
smaller number of particles. (Table 3.).

Standardized values were used as a reference point in the calibration of the sample values.
The ultrapure water values were divided from the measured sample values. These values
were plotted against the concentration of the standards in a diagram to obtain a calibration
curve and an equation for the linear line by use of least square analysis (in Excel). The
equation from the first measurements were used, since the number of particles will decrease
with time. The BC signal was measured with an incandescence detector, where the output
signal is named BHNL. The equation y=0.1292x+0.0189 for the calibration curve was obtained.
This calibration curve shows how the incandescence signal is transferred into BC
concentration, based on the standards. In the equation, y is the BC concentration in ppb and
x is the incandescence signal (BHNL).

6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
6.1 Contamination
To understand how important cleanliness is in this work, the first analyzed IC sample was a
“finger-test”. When a finger is dipped in ultrapure water for a couple of seconds, ions
transferred from the skin to the solution. The most elevated values for the “finger-test”
compared to the ultrapure water are highlighted in Table 4 with a light blue color. The reason
for elevated values of sodium, chloride, potassium, and acetate can be explained by sweat
from the skin. The high value of acetate originates, however, most likely from nail polish and
calcium from the nails. The elevated value for nitrate is uncertain.

The results from the blank ice were compared to the “finger-test” and were considered not
to be contaminated. Blank ice was cut during three different stages of the entire cutting
process: before the ice cores were cut, after the ice cores were cut and after the saw table
was cleaned. Three ice samples of blank ice were obtained from each of these stages. They
were analyzed with IC and the mean value for each stage was calculated (see Table 5.). The
values before cutting and after cleaning are in good agreement. The values after cutting are
slightly elevated compared to the two other columns. This means that there is some minor
contamination between the ice cores; the values are, however, quite low. It is quite difficult
to avoid all cross contamination between different ice cores. However, these values remain
satisfactory.

6.2 Ice core dating
Every ice core is different, and the dating methods vary much. One usually starts by
pinpointing a reference horizon. The first expected reference horizon in the B18 ice core
would be the tritium peak from the nuclear testing in 1963 (Eichler, et al., 2000). However,
we did not estimate that this part of the ice core would extend so far back in time. The depth
was converted from cm to meters of water equivalent (m w.eq.) (see Equation 5.) to account
for varying density. For this work annual layer counting was used, plus a reference horizon
from B01, see below.

Equation 5. Converting depth in cm to depth in m w.eq.

6.2.1 Determination of the year 2001 in B18
The depth of the analyzed part of the ice core was known (17.1 m w.eq.), and the next step
was to determine which year this depth would correspond to. The average annual snow
accumulation rate for the B01 was used to roughly estimate the age, and the rate was 0.56
m w.eq. (Eichler, et al., 2009a). There are 17 years between the drilling of the two ice cores
from the Belukha. If one were to multiply 17 by 0.56 m w.eq., one would obtain the rough
estimation that the year 2001 in the B18 would be at a depth of 9.52 m w.eq.. This represents
a roughly estimated value only since the average snow accumulation varies from year to year.

The data for ions and stable water isotopes from B01 and B18 was compared to determine
the year 2001 more exactly. By plotting the data from B01 with the data from B18 and further
wiggling the data until a match was found, a good overlap could be found. The data from B01
shows a peak in the calcium concentration at year 2000-2001 (Fig. 12.). This calcium peak
was used when the two data sets were compared. The most intense calcium peak (at 10.6 m
w.eq.) match extremely well when the depth for B01 was changed from 9.52 m. w.eq. to 10.1
m w.eq.. The values for both B01 and B18 are calculated as 3-point moving averages to make
it visually easier to match. The ion concentration was expressed in µeq/L instead of ppb.
(Equation 6.) The match was checked for other ions as well as for SWI.

6.2.2 Determine the last year in B18
The match between B01 and B18 is convincing in the beginning (see Fig. 12.). Further down
agreement is less good, likely due to variability in the snow accumulation. The depth of 10.1
m w.eq. would, therefore, not be true for the end of this ice core part. The last year was
estimated on the depth of year 2001. The estimation can also be based on the depth for year
2018. The time difference will be longer for 2018 compared to 2001 to the last year and,
therefore, more uncertain (Equation 7.).

By wiggling the two data sets, it was detected that the end matches at a depth of 8.9 m w.eq.
of B01. The ammonium and sulphate matches are very clear, and the sulfate peak is very
distinctive (see Fig. 13). The δ18O data sets do not agree well with each other, which is most
likely due to meltwater percolation. Since the B01 is dated, it is easy to check which year this
peak would correspond to. The end of the ice core corresponds to the year 1985. This also
proves that the estimation made from the depth of year 2001 is more accurate than the
estimation made from the depth of year 2018.

6.2.3 Determination of years based on annual signals
The seasonal signals from ions and SWI were used to attribute years in the ice core. This was
done with the Ice Core Dating software. This program uses ice core glaciochemical records
to create a depth-age scale. One can choose which signals to use in the program. Here, the
signals used are 3-point moving averages, to visualize the shown trends more easily. An
attempt was made to date the ice core with the original values, which turned out to be
difficult because all the details made it complicated to visualize the entirety. This software
cannot process negative values, which was a problem for the negative values for SWI. To
solve this problem, the number 25 was added to all δ18O values. The δ18O values (see Fig. 14.)
should be within the range of (-25) – (-10) instead of 0 – 15. The three known years were first
pinpointed in the software, before the annual layers were chosen. The first known year was
2018 when the ice core was drilled, and the years 2001 and 1985 were determined from
matching in Excel. Since the ice core was drilled during the summer, the year 2018 could not
be placed at the beginning of the diagram, since it is year 2018.5.
When the three pre-determined years (2018, 2001 and 1985) were placed, the years with
clear winter minimum were added. For the annual layer counting, much focus was put on
ammonium, calcium, sulphate and the stable water isotopes. These ions exhibit good
seasonal variations in deposition on the glacier. The maximum deposition of these chemical
species will occur during summer, which means that the minimum concentration between
two peaks would be the beginning of a new year. The minimum values for δ18O corresponds
to the winter and, therefore, also to the beginning of a new year. When these lines were

28

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
determined, it was important to check the accumulation rate between the years. The
software program automatically calculated the accumulation for each year, and in this way,
one could see if the potentially added years were much too long or much too short. It is quite
unlikely that one year would have the accumulation rate of 1 m w.eq. or only 0.1 m w.eq.
A screenshot of the work done in the Ice Core Dating software was taken (see Fig. 14.). The
calcium peak that was used to determine the year 2001 in B18 can clearly be seen as well in
the screenshot. The three pre-determined years are shown with yellow lines and the placed
years are shown as dark blue lines. The period from 1995 to 2000 was more difficult to date,
due to loss of annual signals; this area is marked with a light rectangle. The red arrows show
some contradiction with the dating, which will be discussed in the next chapters.
Taking a closer look at the different years in Fig. 14, one can tell that the years 2015, 2000,
1998, 1995, 1990 and 1987 are placed on the δ18O maximum. This contradicts the idea of
placing a year at the minimum of the δ18O signal. Since the shown signal was with a 3-point
moving average, it was decided to take a closer look at the δ18O at the problematic areas,
without the 3-point moving averages.

___________________________________________________________________________
The δ18O signal was plotted against the depth without the 3-point moving averages, which
can be seen in Fig. 15. Without the 3-point moving average, there is a small minimum for
δ18O at the depth of 194.5 cm w.eq.. This minimum could not be seen due to the smoothened
3-point moving average lines. The orange line (see Fig. 15.) shows where the year 2015 was
pinpointed. The graph also shows the amount of ice lenses at that depth. Ice lenses must be
considered when it comes to the accuracy of paleoclimatic reconstruction. Ice lenses are
formed due to melting, percolation and re-freezing of water. Meltwater percolation can elute
chemical species and affect isotopic enrichment, which decreases the seasonal signals. To
confirm the hypothesis that meltwater percolation would have shifted the δ18O signal, the
photograph of ice core 174 (depth of 200 cm w.eq.) was checked. Meltwater percolation can
clearly be seen in the photograph as light vertical lines (see Fig. 15.).

The other years were also checked. Fig. 16 shows where the years 2000, 1998, 1995, 1990
and 1987 were pinpointed. The years are pinpointed at the maximum, the minimum is just
very small. The seasonal signal for δ18O is decreased and shifted, due to meltwater
percolation. With this confirmation, that the years were not actually placed at the δ18O
maximum, the dating was completed with the Ice Core Dating software.

years are marked with yellow lines.

The corresponding depth for every year and the annual accumulation obtained from the Ice
Core Dating Software are presented in Appendix B. The average annual accumulation rate
for this part of the B18 is 0.51 m w.eq.. The dating conclusion is that this part of the B18
extends back in time to the year 1984.7 at the depth of 17.10 m w.eq..

6.2.4 Corroboration of the ice core time scale
To finally prove that the dating is correct, the records of B18 were compared using the
presented time scale. MSA, fluoride, acetate and BC were not analyzed for B01, and could
therefore not be compared with B18. Average annual values for the other chemical species
and SWI for the two ice cores were compared. The comparison between the analyzed ions
for the two ice cores showed a good match (see Appendix C). The concentrations are given
as annual values to make it easier to visualize the match. This comparison confirmed the
dating of the B18. The average annual accumulation rate was remarkably similar for the two
ice cores, 0.56 m w.eq. and 0.51 m w.eq. for B01 and B18 respectively. This explains the good
match for chemical species between the two ice cores. Annual records of chemical species
agree well between the B18 and B01 core, corroborating the established dating and allowing
to update the B01 records to 2018. The uncertainty for dating always exists and for the
analyzed part of B18 it is set at one year. The entire B18, from top to bottom, is dated around
20000 years (Fang, et al., 2021).

6.3 Observations within B18
6.3.1 Ice lenses
Ice lenses could be seen throughout the analyzed part of B18. Most of the ice lenses were
under 3 cm thick (Fig. 17.). Ice lenses show the amount of melting and re-freezing that has
occurred on the glacier. Melting of summer snow on the surface, creates meltwater that
percolates downwards. More melting occurred at 2-3.6 m, at 9.6-11.2 m, and at 19.5-25 m.
It must be taken into consideration that percolation of meltwater can interfere with the
annual chemical signals. The density of the ice core increases with depth until the maximum
density is reached. The red dotted trendline in Fig. 17. clearly demonstrates this increase in
density. The analyzed part of B18 (26.4 m) did not reach its maximum density; firn could be
seen in all ice cores. The maximum density of ice cores is ∼0.9 g/cm3), which is the density of
ice not containing bubbles. The minimum and maximum density of the analyzed part of B18
is 0.45 g/cm3 and 0.81 g/cm3 respectively (i.e., the orange line in Fig. 17.). The density is
dependent on the amount of ice lenses, more ice lenses equal higher density, this can clearly

6.3.2 Airborne particles, visual dust layers, and insects
One dust layer was visually observed as a colored layer in the analyzed part of the B18. The
observed dust layer was 1.5 cm thick at a depth of 7.59 m w.e.q., which represents the
beginning of 2006. When a dust layer is observed, one can expect elevated concentrations
of calcium and magnesium. An increase in concentration can be seen for both magnesium
33

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
and calcium (Fig. 18.). The increase in concentration is small due to the dilution of the dust
layer. The dust layer was only 1.5 cm, and the resolution of the IC sample was 8.3 cm. The
concentration increase would have been considerably higher if only the dust layer were
sampled.
An insect was found in the IC sample 237, the insect is most likely a mosquito. As previously
discussed, the wind can transport dust onto the glacier. Other debris, e.g. pollen and small
insects can also be transported with the wind to the surface of the glacier. The insects are
eventually covered by snow and finally entombed in the glacier when the transformation
from snow to ice occurs. This insect was wholly preserved and found at a depth of 11.7 m
w.eq., which corresponds to the summer of 1998. (see Fig. 18.).

6.4 Major ion concentrations
An overall picture of the analyzed species can be seen in Table 6. The median values in the
analyzed ice core varied between 1.2 ppb and 373.5 ppb. It can clearly be seen that the
percent of anions sulphate, nitrate and formate are the highest. These anions clearly show
the highest median value as well. The highest percent for cations are for ammonium and
calcium. MSA and fluoride clearly show the lowest values. The concentration differences
between the analyzed species are noticeably large. The concentration for fluoride (lowest) is
0.3% of the sulphate (highest) concentration. Appendix C shows a comparison between the
ions analyzed in 2001 and 2018.

The correlation coefficient (r) between the analyzed ions can be calculated to investigate
common sources for the different ions (see Table 7.). The strong correlation between almost
all the chemical species is due to the seasonality of the concentration, which means that the
correlation is due to similarities in the atmospheric transport and not in the strength of the
emission source. To correct this, annual averages of the chemical species were used. The
non-normal distribution was also corrected by calculating the correlation coefficient from
log10[concentration]. The ions at the Belukha glacier mainly originates from dust (calcium,
magnesium, sodium and chloride), anthropogenic sources (nitrate, sulphate and ammonium)
and biogenic emissions (formate, oxalate and ammonium) (Henderson, et al., 2006).
One cannot expect a high correlation between δ18O and the concentration of chemical
impurities on a sample basis. The stable isotope values are smoothed by e.g. sublimation,
diffusion, recondensation of water vapor in the snow, firn matrix triggered by temperature
gradients. This does not affect the concentrations of chemical impurities, which do not
sublimate.

___________________________________________________________________________

6.4.1 Dust-related species
It can clearly be seen from the correlation coefficients in Table 7 that calcium, magnesium,
sodium and chloride correlate well with each other. The believed source for these ions is
mineral dust. The characteristic feature for dust-related species is the large maxima, which
can clearly be seen in the summers of 1994, 2000, 2007 and 2014. (see Fig. 20.). These peaks
are most likely due to increased dust particles from the arid region of central Asia. The main
dust source areas are believed to be the deserts Kara-Kum, Kyzyl-Kum, Mojyn-Kum,
Taklimakan and the Kazakh loess hills (Olivier, et al., 2006) (see Fig. 19.). Studies have shown
that dust from the Taklimakan desert can be transported by the westerlies over long
distances (5000 km) and reach elevations of up to 5000 m. This means that dust from the
Taklimakan desert can reach the Altai Mountains (Sun, et al., 2001).
The main dust tracers are calcium and magnesium. A mineral group containing these
minerals are the calcium-magnesium carbonates, e.g. calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite
(CaMg(CO3)2). Calcium and magnesium could also originate from anthropogenic sources, e.g.
from cement production in areas close to the Altai Mountains. Deposition of mineral dust
enriched with feldspars (NaAlSi3O8-CaAl2Si2O8) can cause an increase in sodium and calcium.
The large maxima for all the mineral dust ions show peaks at the same time, confirming the
same origin. The dust origin is difficult to determine, since the main components in dust
particles (i.e. Si, O and Al) were not analysed.

location of the deserts is shown as different shapes, Kara-Kum as a red circle, Kyzyl- Kum as an orange cross,

Chloride and sodium both show a larger peak in the summer of 2001, which suggests an input
of another mineral enriched in sodium and chloride. Halite (NaCl) is a common evaporite
deposit mineral, so the increase in 2001 could be due to dust enriched with halite. The
evaporite deposits originate most likely from the Aral Sea basin or from the Tibetan Plateau.
Another explanation could be sea salt origin from a body of water. Examples of these water
sources are the Atlantic Ocean, the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the
Black sea. It can be argued that the contributions from oceans are negligible, due to the long
distance from the ocean to the highly continental location. The chloride-to-sodium ration for
Halite is 1.0 and for sea salt 1.16. The median value for chloride to sodium ratio for B18 is
1.05. It is difficult to distinguish these ratios, so the contribution from sea salt cannot be
excluded. The increased chloride concentration can also originate from anthropogenic
sources, e.g. hydrochloric acid from coal combustion (Olivier, et al., 2006). This would explain
the good correlation between chloride and the anthropogenic species; ammonium, nitrate
and sulphate (see Table 7.). Only one dust layer was observed in the analyzed part of B18,
indicating that bigger dust storms reaching Belukha are rare phenomena.

6.4.2 Anthropogenic-related species
A good correlation between nitrate, sulphate and ammonium can also be seen in Table 7, the
source is believed to be anthropogenic. Ammonium correlates well with most of the ions,
indicating several different sources. The anthropogenic species show good seasonal variation,
and the match is clear. The largest peaks occur in 1990, 1994, 2000, 2004 2007, 2013 and
2014 (see Fig. 21). Ammonium emissions from livestock waste, fertilizer and bacterial
decomposition would have common atmospheric transport like the other anthropogenic
species (Olivier, et al., 2006). The correlation between ammonium and formate (r = 0.65) is
very similar to the correlation between ammonium and sulphate (r = 0.57). This indicates
that ammonium has various sources and cannot be attributed to only natural or
anthropogenic origin.
The ions with the highest percentage in the analyzed part of B18 are sulphate and nitrate
(see Table 6.), indicating a significant source. These two secondary aerosols originate from
both anthropogenic and natural sources. The natural source for nitrate includes biomass
burning, soil exhalation, lightning and cosmic rays. The anthropogenic sources include nitrate
fertilizers, traffic emissions and all high temperature processes which oxidize atmospheric N2
(i.e., industries and power plants) (Olivier, et al., 2006). The main part of sulphate emission
originates from anthropogenic sources, namely SO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning.
Several natural sources may influence the sulphate value, e.g. volcanic emissions, mineral
dust and marine biogenic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation in oceans (Schwikowski, et al.,
1999).

6.4.3 Biogenic and biomass burning species
A strong correlation between formate, oxalate and ammonium can be seen in Table 7. The
assumed source is biogenic and biomass burning emissions. Ammonium and carboxylic acids
(that form oxalate and formate) are released from both biogenic and biomass burning
emissions (Olivier, et al., 2006). Formate and ammonium have the third and fourth highest
concentration in the analyzed part of B18 (see Table 6.). The source from where formate and
ammonium originate needs to be considered, the most likely source being the biomass in
Siberia. The concentration trend for formate differs slightly from the other biogenic emission
species. There are two distinctive peaks for the three biogenic emission species, in 1994 and
around 2014 (end of 2013 or beginning of 2014) (see Figure 22.). Two other peaks for formate
can additionally be seen in 2003 and 2015 which, in turn, are not so distinctive for oxalate
and ammonium. Beyond this, there are common peaks for oxalate and ammonium in 1990,
2000, 2004 and 2007 (see Figure 22.). The peak difference could be due to different biomass
which was burnt or different conditions during the fire.
The strongest seasonal fluctuations can be seen for the biomass species (see Fig. 22.). This is
most likely due to the annual growing season and seasonality of temperatures, which
increases the vegetation. Fires are mostly ignited during the warmer season (Olivier, et al.,

2006). The ammonium peaks may differ, since ammonium correlates well with almost all the
analyzed species, indicating several sources for ammonium (see Table 7.).

Fig. 22. Concentration in ppb for biogenic and biomass burning species; formate, oxalate and ammonium.

6.4.4 Other analyzed species
Potassium show high correlation with all species except for acetate, formate and fluoride
(Table 7.). This indicates several different origins for potassium. The correlation to the dustrelated species could be explained by evaporite deposits of potassium-rich feldspar (KAlSi3O8).
The correlation to biomass species can be explained with emissions from biomass burning.
Burning biomass can release inorganic aerosol constituents (calcium and potassium) and
nitrogen species (ammonium and nitrate) (Savarino, et al., 1998). A massive area where
biomass burning can occur is the high northern latitude, which would give rise to large
amounts of mainly organic aerosols but also some inorganic aerosols in the Siberian forest.
This could also explain the correlation between calcium and the biogenic species (Olivier, et
al., 2006). Potassium shows its highest peak (133.6 ppm) in the summer of 2004.
MSA is analyzed in ice cores to investigate marine biogenic productivity. The only source for
MSA is believed to be DMS. DMS is produced by marine phytoplankton found in high
abundance in the Arctic Ocean. MSA is believed to be a potential sea-ice proxy, since the
lowest concentrations of DMS are found under ice and the higher concentrations are found
in open water near the ice margin (Isaksson, et al., 2005). The trendline of MSA shows an
40

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
increase in MSA concentration from 1984 to 2018 (Fig. 23.). A large increase can be seen
between 2013 and 2016. If MSA can be used as a sea-ice proxy, the increased MSA
concentration would indicate melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean. MSA also corroborates that
transport from the Arctic Ocean to the Altai Mountains occurs. Since SO2 is another oxidation
product of DMS, a strong correlation between MSA and sulphate was expected. MSA
correlated well with sulphate (r = 0.45), nitrate (r = 0.40) and potassium (r = 0.41). The
correlation between MSA and potassium is not easily explained.
Fluoride originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The natural sources of
fluoride in the atmosphere include volcanic eruptions, sea salt and dust particles. Aluminum
smelters are one of the main anthropogenic sources of fluoride in the atmosphere. A byproduct of aluminum smelters are the gases perfluorocarbons and hydrogen fluoride. Other
anthropogenic sources are coal burning, industrial processing of cement and phosphate. The
degradation of chlorofluorocarbons, which were widely used during the 20th century, can
also affect the current fluoride concentrations (Preunkert, et al., 2001). Fluoride shows one
large peak (32.9 ppm) at the beginning of 1994, while the average value for the measured
fluoride concentration is 1.6 ppm (Fig. 23.). The cause of this fluoride peak is uncertain.
Acetate shows two larger peaks, the first in 1994 and the second in 2014. Acetate does not
correlate well with any other ion, which suggest contamination issues. The behaviour of
acetate is unexpected and requires more strict quality control of the results because of
contamination and chromatographic issues, this was not possible in the time frame of this
thesis.
Some distinctive peaks for almost all the analyzed species can be seen for the years 1994,
2000, 2004, 2007 and 2014. This could be due to the common transport in the atmosphere
or in some cases also due to enrichment in ice lenses. To determine which, further research
is required.

6.5 Picarro results
6.5.1 δ18O
The δ18O values show valuable information concerning the variations in the regional
temperatures (Eichler et al., 2009a). The δ18O values from the summer of 1985 to the summer
of 2018 were obtained (Fig. 24.) Fluctuations are a result of isotopic fractionation. The values
will be negative, since the ice cores contain a lower 18O/16O ratio than the water in the ocean.
The δ18O value during winter months will be more negative than the δ18O value during
summer. This is because the maximum amount of moisture in air decreases with decreasing
temperature. The ice core will therefore show layers with both high and low δ18O values. The
extremely low value of -21.17‰ at year 2003 indicates a cold winter and the extremely high
value of -9.64‰ at year 2018 indicates a warm summer. The δ18O shows only a few strong
winter minima and the average δ18O value (-13.09‰) is relatively high considering the
elevation (4506 m a.s.l.). This can be explained with the help of information received from
the meteorological station Ak-kem (2000 m a.s.l.) located 7 km north of the Belukha glacier.

42

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
The precipitation at the Belukha glacier dominates during the summer months, i.e., June to
August, with 58%. During the winter months, i.e. December to February, only 4% of the yearly
precipitation is received (Eichler et al., 2009c). The average annual accumulation at Ak-kem
can also be used to interpret the δ18O results. This value for the years 1991 to 2000 at the
Belukha glacier was calculated to be 0.42 m w.eq. and at Ak-kem 0.53 m w.eq. The lower
value at the Belukha glacier is not to be expected, since the amount of precipitation should
increase with increased altitude. The reason for the lower annual precipitation value at the
Belukha glacier is most likely due to wind erosion. Some of the snow has been eroded with
the wind, which decreases the amount of accumulation (Olivier, et al., 2019).

The δ18O values for B01 and B18 are compared in Fig. 25. The values correlate well with each
other. The only noticeable exception is at year 1987, where the value for B18 increased
instead of decreased. This is most likely due to percolation of meltwater, which shifted the
values. The annual average value for the years that exist in both ice cores, i.e. 1985 to 2000,
are in excellent agreement. The annual average δ18O value for this period for B01 is -12.66‰
and -12.45‰ for B18.

6.5.2 d-excess
The deuterium excess shows valuable information of water vapor source region and
transport. The average d-excess globally is ∼10‰. The relative humidity at the water vapor
source plays an important role. When the relative humidity at the ocean surface is low, light
water isotopologues will preferably evaporate (kinetic effect) resulting in more depleted
(negative) δ18O values of water vapour, which increases the d-excess. This means that the dexcess will have a higher value during the winter months compared to the summer months
(see Fig. 26.) (Bershaw, 2018). Another factor that increases the d-excess is the re-evaporated
water vapor from internal sources, i.e. continental sources. The highest d-excess values can
be seen during winter months, when the Siberian High restricts intrusion of air masses from
external sources. This precipitation is brought by the southern cyclones from the AralCaspian Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Evaporation from plants and animals
also increases the d-excess value. The lowest values can be seen during summer months,
when the western cyclones bring precipitation from the Atlantic Ocean. Some summer
precipitation can also originate from the Pacific Ocean and Arctic Ocean. The accumulation
of both internal and external sources is higher during the summer months. The main amount
of precipitation in the Siberian Altai originates from marine sources, with the Atlantic Ocean
as the main source (Aizen, et al., 2006).
The average d-excess value of the analyzed part of B18 is 16.30‰. The highest value of
22.72‰ occurred during the winter of 2018 and the lowest value of 10.16‰ occurred during
the summer of 2012. Negative anomalies in the d-excess record can be seen between 1987
and 1993. This is most likely due to changes in the moisture source, i.e. decreased amount of

44

re-evaporated precipitation or increase in oceanic precipitation. Positive anomalies can be
seen between 1999 and 2006, with causes vice versa of the negative ones.

6.6 BC concentrations
The BC concentrations show two pronounced maxima, the first in the middle of 1992 (89.6
ppb) and the second at the end of 2004 (39.2 ppb) (Fig. 27.). At first glance, one might think
that something went wrong in the analysis, since the values of these peaks are so much
higher. With a closer inspection one can see that the peaks are formed by values from two
analyzed samples (two dots), which indicates that the analysis is correct. The average value
for all samples is 5.56 ppb. The red line shows the trendline of BC concentrations, which is
steadily decreasing from 1984 towards 2018 (Fig. 27.). The year-to-year fluctuations can be
explained with transport fluctuations, but the general downwards trend must be explained
with something else. Generally, a 70% decrease of BC concentrations can be seen. At the end
of the ice core (1984), the mean value was 10 ppb and at the beginning of the ice core (2018)
the mean value was 3 ppb. This decrease can be attributed to the reduction of BC emissions
after the dissolution of the USSR (Osmont, et al., 2018). Reduction in other anthropogenic
sources could also contribute to the reduced rBC values, e.g. the mitigation policies for
residential, industry and road transport emissions. The air quality can effectively be improved
with emission mitigation policies.

At Kevo (69°45’N, 27°02’E), in the Finnish Arctic, direct measurements of BC concentration
have been made from 1964 to 2010. This was accomplished with filter samples. A general
decrease in the BC concentration was seen at Kevo as well; the decrease was calculated to
be ∼1.8% yr-1 (Dutkiewicz, et al., 2014). The yearly decrease for the B18 ice core can also be
calculated. The calculations did not include the years 1984 or 2018, since the data are not
available for the entire year, which leads to a total period of 32 years (1985 to 2017). The
average value for the first ten rBC samples (10.57 ppb) and the last ten rBC samples (4.70
ppb) was calculated (Equation 8.). The significant decrease rate was calculated at 1.7% yr-1.
This correlates well with the result from Kevo.

Most of the BC originates from anthropogenic sources, i.e. energy production, industry,
diesel engines and residential biofuel uses. Until the mid-20th century, the Western countries
were mainly responsible for the BC emissions. Currently, Asia with its emerging global
economy is the major contributor. Natural sources, e.g. biomass burning, also affect the BC
concentration, but on a much smaller scale (Osmont, et al., 2018). The rBC concentration was
compared with NH4+ and HCOO- concentration to see if trends from biomass burning could
be seen. For both rBC peaks a simultaneous increase in NH4+ and HCOO- was seen (Fig. 28.).
To see if the peaks could be related to anthropogenic sources as well, comparison with SO42was performed. It is important to keep in mind that melting might have affected the
concentration. The detailed source attribution for BC is difficult, since several emission
sources exist. Since the anthropogenic emission sources are quite constant, it is believed that

46

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
the peaks in 1992 and 2004 are due to biomass burning. The peak in 1992 is not accompanied
by a high sulfate peak, which indicates that the BC originates from biomass burning. The extra
biomass burning could originate from natural sources, e.g. wildfires.

Since BC was not measured for B01, the B18 record will be compared with an ice core drilled
from Tsambagarav (Fig. 4.). Tsambagarav (4130 m asl, 48°39.338’N, 90°50.826’E) is also a
mountain peak in the Altai Mountain range, it is located in Western Mongolia (Herren, et al.,
2013). There are two clear peaks in the BC data from Tsambagarav. The first one is in the
spring of 1995 (69.7 ppb) and the second is in the summer of 2008 (31.0 ppb). This is very
interesting, since both ice cores exhibits two peaks with almost the same concentration, but
3 to 4 years apart. The distance between Belukha and Tsambagarav is 325 km, but the peak
difference cannot be explained by distance between the sites. The reason for the peak
difference is, therefore, most likely due to dating uncertainty in both ice cores.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The first 26.5 m of the B18 was successfully analyzed and dated at PSI. The samples needed
for the major ion, stable isotope and BC analyses were cut into pieces with 8 cm resolution
in a -20 °C cold room. The dating was performed with the help of the B01 ice core, and the
concentrations were compared to each other to find overlapping concentration trends. The
dust peak in B01 proved to be significant for the dating process. Thanks to this peak the year
2001 could be determined in the B18. The B01 was also used to determine the last year in
B18. With the help of annual signals from ions and SWI, the rest of the years could be
attributed. Some ice lenses were observed, which indicated surface melting on the glacier.
This made the dating process more difficult, since some annual signals were shifted. The last
year in this part of B18 was estimated to be 1983, this estimation was done with the help of
the accumulation rate from B01 (0.56 m w.eq.). The final year of this analyzed part of B18
turned out to be the year 1984.7, which was very close to the first estimation.
In addition to ice lenses, other stratigraphic features of interest were also seen in the ice core.
A 1.5 cm thick dust layer at a depth of 759.3 m w.eq. was seen as an orange layer in the ice
core, corresponding to the beginning of 2006. An increase in the main dust-related species,
namely calcium and magnesium, could be seen at the depth corresponding to the same time.
The source for this dust is most likely from the arid region of central Asia. An overview of the
dust-related species shows a decreasing trend from 1984 to 2018. This could possibly be due
to fewer dust events at Belukha. Dust events are uncommon at Belukha, since only one dust
layer could be visually noted in 34 years. Beside the dust particles, an insect was also
observed in the ice core. This insect was found at a depth of 11.7 m w.eq., which
corresponded to the summer of 1998. The insect was most likely a mosquito, but further
analyzes on the mosquito was not conducted.
The accumulation rate for B18 was calculated to be 0.51 m w.eq., which is almost the same
as the accumulation rate for B01. The comparison between the accumulation rate for
Belukha and the meteorological station Ak-kem suggested some loss of precipitation at
Belukha due to wind erosion. This did not come as a surprise since this was already shown
for the B01. The mean δ18O value for the analyzed part of B18 was -13.09‰, which is
considered a high value for the elevation of 4506 m a.s.l., the mean value was high due to
only a few strong winter minima. The lowest δ18O value of -21.17‰ occurred in year 2003
and the highest δ18O value of -9.64‰ occurred in year 2018. The annual δ18O value for B01

49

Viola Wilson
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
and B18 are in excellent agreement for the time period 1985 to 2000. The annual average
δ18O value for this period for B01 is -12.66‰ and -12.45‰ for B18. The d-excess holds
information of the water vapor source. The higher d-excess values originates mostly from reevaporated water vapor from internal sources. Whereas the lower d-excess values originate
from external sources. This means that the values will be higher during the winter months,
when the air transport to the Altai mountains is restricted by the presence of the Siberian
High.
The obtained information from the analyses was manifold. The ion impurity origin could be
determined with the help of correlation analysis. Most of the analyzed ions could be assigned
to one of the following groups: dust, anthropogenic or biomass related species. The expected
fluctuation agreed well with the obtained results, i.e. an increase in concentration during the
summer months. The lower concentration during the winter months is caused by restriction
of convection due to vertical stability of the atmosphere and the presence of the Siberian
High. Increased concentration trends for almost all analyzed species could be seen for the
years 1994, 2000, 2004, 2007 and 2014. This is most likely due to enrichment in ice lenses or
due to common atmospheric transport.
The sources for dust-related species were believed to be the deserts Kara-Kum, Kyzyl-Kum,
Mojyn-Kum, Taklimakan and the Kazakh loess hills. An additional input of the sea salt-related
species could not be neglected, the main origin was believed to be the evaporite deposits
and water sources. Sodium and chloride could therefore have an additional source from the
Aral Sea basin, the Atlantic Ocean and the seas in the Middle East. Ammonium correlated
well with most of the analyzed ions, which suggested multiple sources. The anthropogenic
sources were believed to be emissions from livestock wastes, fertilizers and bacterial
decomposition and natural sources was believed to be biogenic and biomass burning
emissions. Formate and ammonium had the third and fourth highest concentration in the
analyzed part of B18, which suggest a significant input of biogenic emissions from Siberia.
The large stored terrestrial carbon in Siberia might cause increased forest fire activity, if the
estimated temperature increase in Asia occurs. The two highest ion concentration in the
analyzed part of B18 were sulfate and nitrate. These secondary aerosols are produced by
oxidation of SO2 and NOX, which mainly originates from anthropogenic sources, e.g. fossilfuel burning, industrial and traffic emissions. The natural sources for these ions are, e.g.
volcanic emissions, biomass burning and lightning.

MSA is believed to be a sea-ice proxy, and the increasing trend suggested melting of sea ice
in the Arctic Ocean between 2013 to 2016. Potassium is the only other ion that showed an
increasing trend from 1984 to 2018. The highest correlation for potassium is with calcium
(r = 0.71). These ions have a common origin from inorganic aerosols from biomass burning
emission. A decreasing trend is seen for calcium, but the largest share of calcium originates
most likely from dust. One possibility is that the amount of calcium has decreased more than
a possible increase of calcium from biomass burning. But the other biogenic and biomass
burning related species, i.e. formate, oxalate and ammonium, shows a decreasing trend.
Another possibility for the increased potassium concentration could be a change in dust
sources. The dust could originate from a source with a higher concentration of potassiumbased minerals. The ions with no visible change in concentration during this time period was
nitrate and acetate.
The BC concentration also showed a significant decrease, due to cleaner cars and fewer coal
fired power plants. The decrease rate for BC at Belukha was calculated to be 1.7% yr-1. The
main part of the BC particles was believed to originate from anthropogenic sources, e.g.
energy production and industry, and the natural sources, e.g. biomass burning, was believed
to be less significant. A decrease in concentration can also be seen for sulfate but not for
nitrate. NOx emissions could still be high due to the increased number of cars and higher
emissions than anticipated. The BC concentration was not measured for the B01. The B18 BC
concentration was, therefore, compared with a BC record from an ice core obtained from
Tsambagarav. The two distinctive BC concentration peaks could be seen in both ice cores,
but with a few years apart. This was most likely due to dating uncertainty in both ice cores,
but further research is needed. At its deepest point, the B18 dates around 20000 years back
in time.

9 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Den här magisteravhandlingen utfördes som ett samarbete mellan Åbo Akademi och Paul
Scherrer Institute. Den svenska titeln för avhandlingen är ”En analys av främsta joner, stabila
vattenisotoper samt svarta kolpartiklar i den övre delen av Belukha iskärnan från Sibiriska
Altai”.
Glaciärer innehåller information om kemiska föroreningar och stabila vattenisotoper. De
fungerar därför som naturliga arkiv för tidigare klimat och luftföroreningar. Denna
information är välbevarad om smältning försummas samt om den årliga nederbörden
förekommer som snö. Den hydrologiska cykeln och fördelningen av stabila vattenisotoper
mellan de olika reservoarerna kan användas för att förutspå tidigare temperaturer. Då
vattnet förflyttar sig i den hydrologiska cykeln kommer 16O-isotoper att anrikas, eftersom 18Oisotoperna är tyngre. Den här fraktioneringen är temperaturberoende och förhållandet
mellan 18O/16O-isotoper (δ18O) kan därför användas för att bestämma variationer i tidigare
temperaturer. Depositionen av kemiska föroreningar är störst under sommaren, eftersom
lufttransporten förhindras av de torra och kalla förhållandena under vintern. För tillfället
minskar volymen av glaciärer runtom i världen och det är därför viktigt att bedriva
paleoklimatologisk forskning samt bevara iskärnor medan möjligheten fortfarande finns.
För den aktuella studien skars iskärnorna enligt tidigare utförda beräkningar och
skärningsscheman i ett kylrum med -20 °C. För att minimera kontamineringsrisken är det av
yttersta vikt att kylrummet är rent. Största delen av de observerade islinserna var under 3
cm, islinser återger mängden smältning på glaciären. Det bör beaktas att smältvattnets
perkolering kan störa de årliga kemiska signalerna. Därefter kunde proven analyseras med
IC, WS-CRDIS och SP2. Det finns flera olika tillvägagångssätt för datering av iskärnor.
Vanligtvis används stratiografiska markörer, radioaktivt sönderfall och säsongsvarierande
signaler. Dateringen för denna iskärna utfördes genom att jämföra de kemiska signalerna
med en annan iskärna som borrades från Belukha-glaciären år 2001. En distinkt topp av
dammrelaterade joner och säsongsvarierande signaler visade sig vara betydelsefull för
datering. Iskärnan sträckte sig tillbaka till 1984 och de kemiska signalerna stämde generellt
bra överens mellan de två iskärnorna från Belukha.

konstateras. Calcium, magnesium, natrium och klorid hörde till dammrelaterade partiklar,
med ursprung från öknar, och ytterligare källa för natrium och klorid var havssalt. Nitrat,
sulfat och ammonium hörde till de antropogent-relaterade partiklar, med ursprung från
trafikutsläpp, förbränning av fossila bränslen och gödsel. Ammonium hörde även,
tillsammans med format och oxalat, till partiklar som var relaterade till biogena arter och
biomassa. Största delen av dessa partiklar kommer från Sibirien, som är en av de största
reservoarerna av terrestrialt kol i världen. Övriga analyserade joner var fluorid, MSA, acetat
och kalium. MSA tros vara en potentiell havsis-proxy och visade ökad havsissmältning 2013
– 2016. För acetat och kalium fanns flera potentiella ursprung. Nästan alla joner uppvisade
en minskande trend i koncentrationen från 1984 – 2018.
Det genomsnittliga δ18O-värdet (-13,09‰) var relativt högt med tanke på elevationen (4506
m ö.h.), vilket indikerar en brist på starka vinterminima. Det lägsta uppmätta värdet
(-21,17‰) år 2003 indikerar den kallaste perioden och det högsta uppmätta värdet (-9,64‰)
år 2018 indikerar den varmaste perioden. Trenden för den årliga Den δ18O-koncentrationen
för de två iskärnorna uppvisade endast en märkbar avvikelse, vilket högst antagligen beror
på smältvattenperkolation. Deuteriumöverskottet var högre under vintermånaderna och
lägre under sommarmånaderna, vilket tyder på en tillförsel av vattenånga från interna källor
under vintern och från externa källor under sommaren. Den största andelen av nederbörden
i Sibiriska Altai kommer från marina källor, med Atlanten som huvudkälla. Andra källor till
nederbörd är till exempel Medelhavet samt avdunstning från växter och djur. Den
genomsnittliga årliga ackumuleringsgraden var 0,51 m vattenekvivalent.
Svarta kolpartiklar bildas vid ofullständig förbränning av kolhaltigt material, dvs. biomassa
och fossilt bränsle. De unika egenskaperna hos svarta kolpartiklar, dvs. den låga kemiska
aktiviteten, den stora ljusabsorberingsförmågan samt den höga eldfastheten, påverkar
jordens strålningsbudget. Dessa partiklar bidrar till den globala uppvärmningen genom att
reducera albedoeffekten, direkt absorbera solljus i atmosfären samt genom att modifiera
molnegenskaper. Analysen av de svarta kolpartiklarna visade två distinkta toppar.
Koncentrationen av de svarta kolpartiklarna jämfördes med en iskärna från Tsambagarav,
som befinner sig 325 km från Bleukha. De två distinkta topparna kunde även ses i
Tsambagaraviskärnan men 3–4 år senare än i Belukha. Detta beror troligtvis på
dateringsosäkerheter.
