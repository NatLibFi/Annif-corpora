Abstract:
During the past decades, the forms of formal scholarly communication and publishing have
undergone profound changes; from publishing in print format to digital format, and from
publishing in closed access channels to publishing online as open access (OA). The question of
OA to research outputs is a current issue for research funders, universities, and researchers.
The aim of this study is to examine the transition towards OA publishing in humanities.
Previous studies suggest that the development towards increased OA has been slow in the
humanities in particular. To understand the transition towards increased OA publishing, it is
central to consider both the researchers’ perspective and the characteristics of the humanities. In
this study, the humanities at Åbo Akademi University (ÅAU) serve as a case study to examine
researchers’ publishing patterns, and their views on and experiences of OA publishing.
Two separate methods of data collection were applied in the study. To map the publishing
patterns in humanities in relation to other fields of science, publication data of peer reviewed
publications in humanities (N=192) and all fields of science together (N=1 016) produced in
2018 at ÅAU was retrieved from the national publication database Virta. To map researchers’
views on and experiences of OA publishing, an online survey was conducted among
researchers (N=59) affiliated to the Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology (FHPT) at ÅAU.
The analysis of publication data shows that the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities at
ÅAU are typical to the humanities in general: the proportions of publications as book sections,
monographs and edited works are larger than in other fields of science. In comparison with
other fields of science, the current state of OA publishing in humanities can be considered at a
decent level at ÅAU. In the survey, FHPT researchers reported a good level of awareness and
knowledge of OA issues, and positive perceptions of OA overall. However, the OA attributes
of publications were not the most important factors in researchers’ choices of publication
channel. The perceived quality and prestige of OA journals, funding for article processing
charges, and green OA as a viable form of OA publishing emerge as critical to the development
towards increased OA in the future, also in the organizational and national setting of the present
study.

Arbetets titel: Övergången till öppen publicering inom humaniora: En fallstudie om forskares
publiceringsmönster, uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av öppen publicering vid ett finländskt
universitet

Abstrakt:
Under de senaste årtiondena har formerna för formell vetenskaplig kommunikation och
publicering gått igenom stora förändringar, dels från att forskare publicerat sin forskning i
tryckt format till digitalt format, dels från att publicera i stängda publikationskanaler till att
publicera med öppen tillgång på internet. Frågan om öppen tillgång (open access, OA) till
forskningsresultat är en aktuell fråga för forskningsfinansiärer, universitet och forskare.
Studiens syfte är att granska övergången till öppen vetenskaplig publicering inom humaniora.
Tidigare studier visar att utvecklingen mot ökad OA varit långsam särskilt inom humaniora. För
att förstå övergången till ökad öppen publicering är det centralt att ta både forskarnas perspektiv
och humanioras särdrag i beaktande. I denna studie fungerar humaniora vid Åbo Akademi (ÅA)
som en fallstudie för att studera forskares publiceringsmönster, uppfattningar om och
erfarenheter av öppen publicering.
För fallstudien tillämpades två separata datainsamlingsmetoder. För att kartlägga
publiceringsmönster inom humaniora i relation till andra vetenskapsområden hämtades
publikationsdata för referentgranskade vetenskapliga publikationer inom humaniora (N= 192)
och alla vetenskapsområden sammanlagt (N=1016) som utkommit år 2018 vid ÅA ur den
nationella publikationsdatabasen Virta. För att kartlägga forskares uppfattningar om och
erfarenheter av öppen publicering genomfördes en enkät bland forskare (N=59) vid Fakulteten
för humaniora, psykologi och teologi (FHPT) vid ÅA.
Analysen av publikationsdata visar att publiceringsmönstren inom humaniora vid ÅA följer
typiska drag för humaniora överlag, dvs. andelen publikationer som bokkapitel, monografier
och redigerade verk är större än inom övriga vetenskapsområden. I jämförelse med övriga
vetenskapsområden kan andelen öppet tillgängliga publikationer inom humaniora anses vara på
god nivå överlag. Därtill visade forskare vid FHPT en god nivå av medvetenhet och kunskaper
om OA-frågor och en positiv inställning till öppen publicering. Emellertid var publikationers
OA-attribut inte de viktigaste egenskaperna i forskares val av publikationskanal. OAtidskrifters kvalitet och prestige, finansiering för artikelavgifter och parallellpublicering som ett
ansett alternativ för öppen tillgång utgör kritiska faktorer i utvecklingen mot ökande öppen
publicering, även i den utbildningsorganisation och det nationella sammanhang som den här
studien handlar om.

1. Introduction
During the past decades, the landscape of scholarly communication has undergone
profound changes. At the heart of this change is the transition from publishing in print
format to publishing in digital format. This transition is intertwined with another
essential change: from publishing in closed subscription journals to publishing digitally
online in open access (OA) journals or making the publication openly available in other
ways (De Silva & Vance 2017, Mukherjee 2009). The present study examines the
transition from publishing in closed publication channels to publishing OA in
humanities.

1.1.

Area of research

The questions as to what ‘open access’ is, how to promote it, and who pays for it, have
become increasingly important issues on the agenda of research funders, policymakers,
universities and the research community, both internationally and in Finland. Despite a
variety of definitions of OA, it is widely agreed that “Open Access (OA) literature is
digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions”
(Suber 2012, 4). The main objectives of OA publishing are to make research available
and readable for the entire research community, practitioners and the public.
Consequently, OA to research output is considered a way to contribute to the
democratization of knowledge and support its usefulness in society (Suber 2012, 10).
The OA movement, originally initiated by researchers and research institutions in the
early 1990s in the US, was a reaction against several developments in scholarly
publishing, most importantly the commercialization and increasing profit-making by
large publishing houses (Laakso et al 2011). Institutions and libraries in higher
education, both internationally and in Finland, use a major part of their annual budgets
to cover subscription fees to conventional publishers which provide access to academic
literature only for a cost.
For individual researchers, the access to subscribed materials provided by their research
institutions is crucial: without the journal subscriptions, researchers do not have access
11

Malin Fredriksson 2020

to crucial parts of the body of research literature in their disciplines. This also means
that researchers, who for some reason do not have a current academic affiliation, have
difficulties in following the most recent developments in their research fields. Similarly,
researchers in developing countries may not access to research literature, since their
institutions cannot afford the subscription fees (Suber 2012, 20). Overall, there is a great
variation as to what resources university libraries are able to provide access to.
Situations in which research is funded by public state funding, researchers use their
salaried work time to produce new knowledge, and the university library finally pays
subscription fees to provide access to the publications, are not unusual. This market
mechanism in which state funding (i.e., tax income) goes into the pockets of
commercial publishers through several routes (e.g. both authors and readers are
charged), is called double-dipping or even triple-dipping (Suber 2012, 25). In case the
university library does not provide access to the particular journal, it is not unusual that
researchers do not have access to the published version of articles they have written.
The recent development of digital technology and research infrastructure, together with
expectations from research funders, have paved the way for research institutions and
researchers to take steps towards increased OA publishing. Although there are
technological solutions that ideally enable immediate OA, a more critical change is still
ongoing. It has been argued that the major obstacles for achieving a greater proportion
of OA are “not technical, legal or economic, but cultural” (Suber 2012, 8-9). One
indicator of the complexity of the issue is that the development towards increased OA
has been rather slow both internationally and in Finland (Holopainen & Koskinen
2016). On a grass root and every-day level, this means that the changes in the
publishing environment have not been fully embraced by researchers (Gross and Ryan
2015). At the same time, the support functions of research institutions, and most
importantly the university libraries, play a crucial role in the work towards OA (e.g.
Ala-Kyyny 2018, Klain-Gabbay & Shoham 2018).

1.2.

Motivation for the study

Publishing research results is one of the core activities in academia. It has been argued
that the landscape of scholarly publishing is at the moment in a critical transition phase.
12

Malin Fredriksson 2020

There is a growing body of research literature which examines how the quantity of OA
literature has grown in the past years (e.g. Archambault et al 2014, Laakso et al 2011,
Piwowar et al 2018). In recent years, a number of surveys which maps researchers’
views on and experiences of OA publishing have been conducted (e.g. Blankstein &
Wolff-Eisenberg 2019, Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015). To map the current state of
OA publishing, both the emerging publishing patterns and the researchers’ views and
experiences are crucial to observe in order to understand the transition from closed
publishing to open publishing.
All academic disciplines cannot be treated together as a monolithic entity when it comes
to OA publishing (Eve 2014). Thereby, a central area of study is the publishing patterns
in different disciplines, and its effects on how OA publishing is adopted within the
discipline. Previous studies (e.g. Coonin & Younce 2010, Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan
2015) suggest that the level of adoption of OA models is lower in humanities and social
sciences than in natural sciences, technology and medicine. This observation further
motivates the need to examine the patterns of scholarly publishing and researchers’
views and experiences in humanities in particular.
From the perspective of the university, the amount and quality of scientific publications
produced at universities is crucial for determining not only their reputation, but also
their public funding. In Finland, the amount of public funding to universities is based on
the number and quality of publications produced by staff and affiliated researchers at
the university (Ministry of Education and Culture. Core funding of universities 2020).
Consequently, there is an obvious motivation for universities to collect comprehensive
and reliable data on their publications (Ilva 2019). Starting 2021, the OA status of
publications will play an even more important role in the funding model, and
publications which are OA will be more valuable for universities (Ilva 2020). In other
words, it lies in the interest of universities that accurate data on the OA status of
publications are collected, and to encourage their researchers to make their research
openly available through different routes to OA.
Examining the perspective of the researchers is thus central to grasp the current
transition towards increased OA which occur in scholarly communication and
publishing. Researchers’ choices of venues for publishing, in other words scholarly

13

Malin Fredriksson 2020

communication, are central to understand in order to help universities and university
libraries make decisions of future practice and policy.

1.3.

Aim and research questions

The aim of this study is to examine the transition from closed access publishing to OA
publishing in formal scholarly communication in the humanities. The humanities at Åbo
Akademi University in Finland serve as the organizational unit to be examined for the
case study. In the transition from closed access publishing to OA publishing, both the
patterns of scholarly publishing and the views on and experiences of OA publishing
among researchers are central to understand the transition in its organizational context.
The aim is divided into a two-fold case study. Firstly, the study explores the patterns of
scholarly publishing in humanities at ÅAU, with a focus on the patterns of OA
publishing and which routes to OA are typical. Secondly, it examines the awareness,
knowledge, perceptions, and experiences of OA publishing among researchers in
humanities.
The main research question is: How is the transition from closed access publishing to
OA publishing in humanities expressed in publishing patterns, and perceived and
experienced from the perspective of researchers? The main research question is further
divided into sub-questions, which focus on publishing patterns at institutional level and
perceptions and experiences of researchers.
1. Which patterns of scholarly publishing are typical to humanities and how is
OA part of those publishing patterns?
a) How large is the share of peer reviewed OA publications produced in
humanities, compared to other disciplines?
b) Which routes to OA and other publication characteristics are typical to
publications in humanities, compared to other disciplines?
2. What is the level of awareness, knowledge and experiences of OA
publishing among researchers in the humanities, and how do they perceive
of OA publishing?

14

Malin Fredriksson 2020

a) To what extent do researchers report awareness and knowledge of different
forms of OA publishing?
b) To what extent do researchers have experience of OA publishing?
c) What are their perceptions of OA publishing?
d) Which are the main factors that would support researchers in publishing OA,
and which are the main factors that hinder them from publishing OA?
This study provides new empirically based knowledge concerning the transition from
closed access publishing to OA publishing in humanities, from the perspective of
publishing patterns at organizational level and from the perspective of researchers. The
choice to cover both publishing patterns at organizational level and the views and
experiences of researchers is motivated from several points of view. The publishing
patterns are central to examine, as they describe the current state of publishing in a
defined timeframe. To contextualize the current state of publishing in humanities, it is
also central to examine the most central characteristics of publishing in other fields of
science. The views and experiences of researchers in humanities provides first-hand
information into how researchers currently perceive of OA publishing. The results may
further be used for evaluating which OA issues are most critical for researchers and
which aspects should be more emphasized in OA services and support for researchers.
The case study applies a multi-method approach. To examine the patterns of scholarly
publishing in humanities, and the overall situation of publishing at ÅAU, publication
data of peer reviewed publications (2018) is analyzed. The publication data has been
collected for the national publication collection, conducted by the MEC. To map
researchers’ views on and experiences of OA publishing, an online survey is conducted
among FHPT researchers.

15

1.4. The structure of the study
This study starts with an introduction to the topic of OA and the research aim and
questions in Chapter 1.
Chapter 2 provides an overview of central developments in scholarly communication
and scholarly publishing, as well as the central concepts of OA. International OA
initiatives and the financial models of OA and research funding are presented to provide
an overview of the structural and organizational processes which have been taken to
facilitate increasing OA in the research community. As the focus of the present case
study is on a Finnish university, the development of OA in Finland is also described.
In Chapter 3, the focus is on the researchers’ publishing patterns in transition. It
presents the patterns of scholarly publishing in different disciplines and how OA
publishing has become part of the publishing patterns in various disciplines. Previous
research on researchers’ awareness, knowledge and perceptions of OA, and which
factors have been identified to affect behaviors of OA publishing, are presented.
Chapter 4 describes the case organization, how the case study approach has been
applied and the methodological choices. The case study uses a multi-method approach
which combines analysis of publication data and a survey.
Chapter 5 presents the results of the case study, starting with sub-study I based on the
publication data, and continuing with sub-study II based on the survey.
In Chapter 6, the results are discussed in relation to previous research, and its
contributions to the field are explained. Finally, the limitations of the study are
discussed and ideas for future research are presented.

2. Scholarly communication and scholarly publishing in
transition
This chapter starts with an outline of definitions of scholarly communication, how the
emergence and development of OA publishing relates to scholarly communication and
scholarly publishing and continues with describing the main developments of OA
initiatives both in an international and a Finnish perspective. The central concepts used
in this study are described in this chapter.

2.1.

Scholarly communication

Communication and dissemination of research results are key activities in academia. It
has been argued that communication and dissemination of research results are as
important as conducting the research. Without communicating and disseminating the
results in one way or another, the rest of the academic community and society overall
cannot benefit from the results (De Silva & Vance 2017). Scholarly communication is
generally defined as “the system through which research and other scholarly writings
are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and
preserved for future use, and it promotes a shared system of research and scholarship”
(Association of College and Research Libraries 2015).
In the broadest sense of the word, scholarly communication refers to activities during
the entire research process. Scholarly communication primarily refers to communication
between academics (i.e. within the academic community), which in turn can be divided
into formal and informal communication. While informal scholarly communication is
about informal contact between academics in conferences, e-mails or through social
media, formal scholarly communications refers to research outputs in the form of
articles, book chapters, books, or conference contributions (De Silva & Vance 2017).
The focus of this study is on formal scholarly communication, and more explicitly, the
dissemination of research results in peer reviewed publications. Traditionally, the peer
reviewed publication is considered the most prominent form of formal scholarly
communication (Mukherjee 2009). The peer reviewed publication is also the most
critical for the Finnish universities for receiving public funding (Ilva 2017).
17

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Although it should be observed that also informal scholarly communication and nonpeer reviewed publishing is vital to the development of science, informal scholarly
communication and non-peer reviewed publication activities, are considered outside the
scope of the present study.

2.2.

The emergence of Internet and the digital age

The development of digital technology has increased the reach of scholarly
communication in a remarkable way. In the past 20–30 years, scholarly communication
and scholarly publishing have undergone a profound transformation. The change entails
two dimensions: a transition from publishing printed literature to digital literature, and
from publishing research in closed channels to publishing openly accessible online (De
Silva & Candace 2017, Mukherjee 2009).
From a historical point of view, researchers’ decisions about where to publish can be
divided into two eras. Before the emergence of e-journals, researchers were concerned
with other types of publication attributes than researchers are today (Mukherjee 2009).
The most important factors were reaching the right readership audience, the speed of the
publication, the reputation of the publication and publisher, as well as the quality of the
printed physical paper (Dalton, Tenopir & Björk 2020).
Although the emergence of the Internet and the digital age brings with it potential to
increased scholarly communication and dissemination of research results, the idea of
openness in research is not new in formal scholarly communication (Dalton, Tenopir &
Björk 2020). As also Tomperi (2019) points out, openness of research was an innate
principle already in the age of printed media. The distribution and accessibility of
(scholarly) literature has been possible because of the modern library institution. In that
sense, it can be argued that libraries still are in the center of the debate of accessibility,
as well as the debate on the price level (Tomperi 2019).

2.3.

Scholarly publishing and the serials crisis

OA publishing in scholarly journals started in the early 1990s, as soon as electronic
publishing overall became technically possible. However, the background of more
18

Malin Fredriksson 2020

extensive efforts to establish OA publishing can be traced to the so-called serials crisis.
The serials crisis is a central development in scholarly publishing which has continued
for some decades. The serials crisis refers to the increasing subscription costs of serial
publications (Laakso et al 2011). The increasing subscription fees are paid by university
libraries or research institutions which try to provide their researchers with the most
recent and relevant research literature. As the subscription fees have been steadily
increasing, academic libraries have ended up in a situation where they need to cancel
journal subscriptions or ended acquiring scholarly monographs to their library
collection, to cover the increasingly expensive fees. In Finland, the national library
consortium FinElib negotiates agreements with publishers about access to digital
resources. In the beginning of 2019, Finnish researchers’ access to Taylor & Francis’
digital resources was discontinued, as the consortium and the publisher did not succeed
in achieving a new agreement. Especially the opportunity for researchers to publish OA
in the publisher’s journals, which are included in so-called transformative agreements,
was one of the main obstacles for reaching agreement (FinElib 2020).
There are several reasons to the overwhelming increase of subscription fees. According
to Eve (2014, 15), one of the main reasons is that research articles can be regarded as
unique commodities in the sense that it cannot be replaced with another article.
Similarly, an expensive journal title cannot be directly replaced with cheaper one on the
same subject. As a consequence, publishers can act in a monopoly position. In the long
run, scholarly publishing has become dominated by a few commercial publishers. In
addition to the commercial publishers, also academic societies serve as publishers, but
typically at a lower price (Suber 2012). An illustrative example of the situation today is
that the largest commercial academic publishers, such as Elsevier, Wiley, and Springer,
are among the most profit-making companies in the world. Five companies dominate
the scene of scholarly publishing: more than 50 percent of peer reviewed articles
published today are controlled by these companies (Larivière, Haustein & Mongeon
2015).
As part of the response to the serials crisis, alternative financial models for OA
publishing have been developed to decrease the financial and academic power of large
commercial publishers (Suber 2012). The OA movement was initiated in the 1990s by
researchers, publishers, librarians and research institutions, when the development of
19

Malin Fredriksson 2020

information technology and the emergence of the internet enabled online publishing, as
a reaction against the high costs of closed access journals (Laakso et al 2011). The first
steps towards increased OA were slow. The OA movement gained more support in the
beginning of the 2000s, as the first organized initiatives were taken, namely the
Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002) which proclaims the following:
An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible
an unprecedented public good. The old tradition is the willingness of
scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly
journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge. The new
technology is the internet.
Despite the optimistic beginning, researchers (e.g. Björk 2017, Holopainen & Koskinen
2016) argue that the progress towards increased OA over the past two-three decades has
been slower than expected. The current situation, where university libraries pay for both
access to subscription materials and OA publishing is considered expensive (Suber
2012).
During the past two decades, the increase of OA publishing has been remarkable. In
2000, the number of OA journals was 740, and in 2009 it was about 4,700 (Laakso et al
2011). Although it is difficult to provide a comprehensive number of OA journals, one
indicator of this is the number of indexed journals in Directory of Open Access Journals
(DOAJ), which was launched in 2003. At the end of 2015, the number of OA journals in
DOAJ was roughly 10,000 (Gross and Ryan 2015). At the end of 2019, about 14 000
OA journals were indexed in DOAJ (DOAJ 2019). Depending on operational
definitions and data collection methods used, it has been estimated that between 35 and
50 % of all research articles published in recent years, can be retrieved as gold OA,
hybrid, or self-archived in repositories (Archambault et al 2014; Piwowar et al 2018,
Solomon et al 2013).

2.4.

Definitions of open access

Open access (OA) is a multifaceted concept with different meanings, both with regards
to ‘open’ and ‘access’. Internationally and nationally, a variety of definitions are used
for strategical purposes, for example in policy documents, recommendations, and
initiatives.
20

Malin Fredriksson 2020

2.4.1. Gold OA and green OA
One of the most central and established conceptual distinctions is between gold OA and
green OA (Laakso et al 2011). Gold OA includes both full gold OA and hybrid OA. In
full gold OA journals, all articles are freely accessible to readers immediately and
without most restrictions. In this publishing model, there are no subscription fees.
Instead, the publishers charge an Article Processing Charge (APC). The APC is usually
paid by the research funder or research institution, not the individual researcher (ref).
However, not all publishers of full OA journals charge APCs, since they are able to
cover the costs of publishing by other means. Another form of gold OA is the hybrid
OA. The hybrid OA model refers to subscription journals which offer gold OA as an
extra service: some articles are made freely accessible by paying for the APC. In other
words, hybrid journals are a mix of OA articles and closed access (Suber 2012).
Green OA means that the author makes a publication, originally published in a closed
subscription journal, openly available in an institutional repository maintained by the
university or in another publication archive. Therefore, green OA is also called parallel
publishing or self-archiving. Green OA is free of charge for the author. When parallel
publishing, the author shares a version of a paper which follows the copyright and
licensing agreement with the publisher (Björk et al 2014). In other words, the green OA
route is dependent on the policies of the journal or publishers, which typically are more
restrictive than full OA policies (i.e. licensing and embargoes to cover the risk that the
publisher will lose subscription incomes) (Suber 2012).
As also mentioned by Suber (2012), licensing, copyright issues, and various types of
publication charges further complicate the question of how to categorize different types
of OA. For instance, libre OA is free of permission barriers to allow reuse, while gratis
OA is accessible free of charge for the reader.
2.4.2. Other definitions of OA
Despite the widely established distinction between gold and green OA, previous
research on OA publishing suggests also other types of OA, which intends to catch the
versatility of OA statutes of publications.
For instance, Piwowar et al. (2018) provides a narrower definition of gold OA, called
bronze OA. In their study, bronze OA includes both delayed OA and OA channels
21

Malin Fredriksson 2020

which are not Creative Commons (CC) licensed. This definition of bronze OA can be
viewed in contrast to more inclusive definitions OA, such as the one provided by the
Budapest Open Access Initiative, which does not consider the delay of the publication
or licensing issues (Piwowar et al 2018).
Another example of the variations of OA is the platinum or diamond OA. Platinum or
diamond OA is a variation of gold OA for which the publisher does not charge APCs,
which means that publishing in the journal is free of charge for authors (Haschak 2007).
Despite the relevance and usefulness of these concepts beyond the gold-green
dichotomy in the broader discussion of the potential and future of OA publishing, they
are necessarily not compatible with OA definitions used for collecting OA data for
specific purposes, such as the annual national publication data collection conducted by
MEC in Finland (Ilva 2017, Ilva 2019). For this reason, the notions of bronze and
platinum OA are not meaningful definitions for analysis for the scope of this study.
To operationalize the concepts which refer to different types and variations of OA, the
definitions of OA used in this study follow the handbook for the national collection of
publication data (Publication data collection 2018). According to the definition used in
Finland since 2016, a publication needs to be at least freely available to read to classify
as OA (Ilva 2017). The definitions of OA implemented in this study are further
discussed in the chapter on data collection. In comparison, there are narrower
definitions of OA internationally. For instance, the Budapest Open Access Initiative
(2002) recommends use of open licenses (Ilva 2017).
2.4.3. Academic Social Networks and illegal access
A recent development in the dissemination of scholarly literature is the increasing
popularity of academic social networks (ASNs) such as ResearchGate, Academia.edu,
and more subject-specific ones such as HumanitiesCommons. From the perspective of
researchers, ASNs are considered a way for both quick sharing and access to academic
literature.
Another connected development that has emerged in the past years, is the wide-spread
use of pirate copy websites, such as Sci-Hub, for searching academic literature (Björk
2017; Green 2017). In a similar way as ASNs, Sci-Hub and other pirate copy websites
and databases provide convenient and quick access to scholarly publications, but they
22

Malin Fredriksson 2020

provide access to literature which are legally behind paywalls. For that reason, Björk
(2017) uses the concept of black OA when referring to illegal pirate copy databases.
Illegally available versions of publications, which infringe with copyright and license
agreements, are common not only at Sci-Hub, but also on several ASNs. In addition to
the problems of license and copyright infringement at ASNs due to researcher’s
intentional or unintentional sharing of articles, it should be noted that these publications
are in the hands of commercial actors which do not provide any guarantee of permanent
access (Björk 2017).
Taking into consideration the legal and ethical aspects, as well as the question of
permanent access, black OA on pirate websites and articles shared at ASNs are not
considered proper OA. From that point of view, Björk (2017) emphasizes that the aim
of OA policies and their implementation is to make illegal channels and copies
redundant. If all scholarly publications were legally accessible, gratis and/or libre, there
would be no need for using pirate websites or databases for accessing scholarly
literature.
2.4.4. Remarks regarding the use of OA concepts
More specific definitions of OA are also implemented in, for example, the national
collection of publication data of institutions in higher education in Finland, which is
conducted by the MEC. The differences between definitions, which follow from their
different purposes and use, are crucial to consider when operationalizing the concept of
OA. The definitions affect what and how OA is measured, as well as the interpretation
of results. Definitions of these will be provided in the method chapter.

23

2.5.

The perceived benefits of open access publishing for researchers and
universities

This section provides an overview of the arguments of how OA is in the interest of both
researchers and universities.
2.5.1. Cost-effectiveness and transparency
The origins of the OA movement can be considered a reaction against the profit-making
of large publishing houses and the increasing subscription fees university libraries pay
annually to make research literature available for their affiliated researchers (Laakso et
al 2011). One of the basic arguments is that the results of research, which is publicly or
philanthropically funded, should be publicly available and can be used by anybody,
instead of being behind publisher’s paywalls to a limited audience. The financial aspect
is thus a central part of the OA publishing models. As the financial basis for OA
publishing is not enabled by traditional subscription fees covered by paying customers
(academic libraries), OA publishing is dependent on alternative economic models
(Suber 2012).
One of the most central economic models is based on author fees called article
processing charges (APCs) which cover the publisher’s costs to make the OA (both full
OA journals and hybrid journals). In contrast, publishers which provide platinum or
diamond OA, and do not charge authors or readers, external funding is needed.
Typically, platinum or diamond OA is covered by resources from learned societies or
other academic institutions, or government grants (Haschak 2007). From the perspective
of the university, a larger amount of scholarly literature which is OA means that less
budgetary means are needed to cover subscription fees.
2.5.2. Democratization of knowledge
In the subscription-based publishing model, only those researchers who are affiliated to
a university or other research institution, which have the financial basis to cover for
subscription fees, have access to scholarly literature (Suber 2012). In addition,
researchers have access only to e-resources that their institutions have publisher’s
agreements with. Changes in the university libraries’ agreements with publishers mean
that researchers may lose access to certain resources.

24

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Access to scholarly literature is also a global issue. Small research institutions and those
in countries of lower economic development have poor access to scholarly literature
(Suber 2012). As a consequence, only a small share of the scholars in the world have
access to the scholarly literature they need for their research. Immediate access to the
latest research results thus enables the development of science.
Dissemination of research output to the scholarly community can be considered the
basic aim of the OA movement, but the scholarly community as such is not the only
target group. As Suber (2012) notes, the dissemination of research output to an audience
outside the scholarly community, the general public, is an increasingly important
dimension of OA publishing.
2.5.3. Increased circulation, readership and citation benefit
Increased circulation and readership are connected to the so called citation benefit. It is
a well-documented, although not straightforward phenomenon that OA publications
(including both full OA and hybrid) are more frequently cited than closed publications
and thus have a more extensive circulation and readership than closed access articles
(Björk & Solomon 2012, Solomon, Laakso & Björk 2013, Piwowar et al. 2018).

2.6.

OA policies and funding

To facilitate the transition to the OA publishing model, international, governmental and
institutional structures for OA funding have been developed. Internationally, both
public and private research funders have included requirements on OA publishing in
their funding applications in recent years. In the European Union, Plan S (2018) is the
most recent and ambitious international OA initiative. In Plan S, major European
research funders require that:
With effect from 2021, all scholarly publications on the results from research
funded by public or private grants provided by national, regional and
international research councils and funding bodies, must be published in Open
Access Journals, on Open Access Platforms, or made immediately available
through Open Access Repositories without embargo.
Other central principles defined in Plan S (2018) is that authors or their institutions
should retain the copyright to the publications (and preferably use the CC BY license),
25

Malin Fredriksson 2020

and that the OA publication fees should be covered by research funders or institutions,
not individual researchers. Funders should not support the hybrid model of publishing,
since publishers can benefit from both the subscription fees and the APCs. During the
transition period towards a full OA publishing system, research funders may support
these only as part of transformative agreements.
The plan and its implementation have initiated a debate among researchers, since this
would potentially result in a situation where researchers would not be able to publish in
closed access journals or hybrid journals which traditionally have been perceived as
prestigious in their respective research fields (Dalton, Tenopir & Björk 2020).
The Academy of Finland, a governmental funding body of scientific research, and one
of the major research funders in Finland, is one of the research funders which take part
in Coalition-S. The Academy of Finland requires that their recipients of funding publish
their results with OA (parallel publishing included), as planned in a publication plan and
included in the budget submitted together with the application (Academy of Finland
2020).

2.7.

Overview of the developments of OA in Finland

This sub-chapter outlines the central developments of OA policies and publishing in
Finland. In the Nordic countries, the financial support from the governments, the
establishment and maintenance of non-profit portals, and the increasing knowledge of
OA issues are part of the development towards increased OA. A common factor among
the Nordic countries is that they have a similar infrastructure of public funding for
research and universities’ core funding (Björk 2019).
2.7.1. National policies and coordination
Characteristic to the situation of open science and research in Finland is that OA
publishing, and open science more broadly, have been supported and coordinated by
official bodies. In international comparison, Finland was among the first countries to
apply the open science approach (Forsström, Lilja, and Ala-Mantila 2019). To start
with, the Open Science and Research Initiative (2014–2017) was a project of the MEC,
which developed guidelines for promoting open science in Finland. The Initiative was
based on extensive cooperation between ministries, universities, research institutes and
26

Malin Fredriksson 2020

research funders. One of the aims of the Open Science and Research Initiative was that
65 % of scientific publications should be openly available by 2017, 75 % by 2018, and
90 % by 2020 (FFLS 2019).
Open science activities in Finland are currently coordinated by The Federation of
Finnish Learned Societies (FFLS). The coordination is based on a strong collaboration
between all members of the research community: researchers and research support in
universities and research institutes, libraries, funders, learned societies, scientific
publishing, academies and the Ministry of Education and Culture. In the “Declaration
for Open Science and Research 2020–2025” the vision for open science and research for
the next years is formulated as follows: “open science and research are integrated in
researchers’ everyday work and support not only the effectiveness of research outputs
but also the quality of research”. In the declaration, a principal part of the mission is to
“promote openness as a fundamental value throughout the research community and its
activities”. The draft of the declaration had been open for comments from both research
institutions and individual researchers. The vision and mission are operationalized in the
national strategy and executive plan issued last year together with the declaration. In the
national policy and executive plan, “Open access to scholarly publications. National
Policy and Executive Plan by the Research Community in Finland for 2020–2025”, the
following objectives are stated:
1. No later than 2022, all new scientific articles and conference publications will
be immediately openly accessible.
2. The total cost of scholarly publication channels and individual publications is
transparent and publicly available.
3. By 2022, a CC-license is applied to all new research publications to provide
open access and to protect researcher’s rights.
4. The research community creates a jointly funded publishing model that
enables immediate open access to research articles published in Finland.
Björk (2019) assesses that as a consequence of strong engagement in OA issues among
the Nordic countries, due to international OA initiatives like Plan S as well as national
policies, the share of OA journals especially in the social sciences and humanities will
increase.
27

Malin Fredriksson 2020

2.7.2. The university funding model and OA
The production of research outputs by university staff is part of the university funding
model. During the years 2017–2020, universities receive 13 % of their annual core
funding based on the quantity and quality of peer reviewed scientific publications
(Ministry of Education and Culture, Universities Core Funding from 2017). In the
funding model which comes into force starting 2021, the universities will receive 14 %
of their core funding based on scientific publications (Ministry of Education and
Culture. Universities Core Funding from 2021).
Until present, OA publications have not given extra funding. However, in the new
funding model (2021) more weigh is given to publications which are OA. In the funding
model, the routes to OA are understood as full OA publication channels, hybrid
journals, and parallel publishing. The coefficient 1.2 will be used to count the value of
OA publications published in 2017–2019 (Ministry of Education and Culture.
Universities Core Funding from 2021). This means that peer reviewed OA journal
articles, book sections and books are 20 % more valuable for universities compared to
closed publications in the same publication type and classification in Publication
Forum. For that reason, increasing the share of publications published in all OA routes
is of financial interest for Finnish universities (Ilva 2019).
2.7.3. National publication collection
The MEC has collected national publication data (item records of publications produced
by their researchers) from universities and other institutions of higher education since
2011. The publication data collected is used for counting the core funding according to
the funding model described above. Consequently, it lies in the interest of the
universities to report the publications of staff and affiliated researchers as extensively
and accurately as possible. The monitoring of the OA status of publications has been
integrated into the national publication collection since 2016 (Ilva 2019).
In 2016, slightly less than 30 % of the peer reviewed publications (in category A,
articles) at Finnish universities were reported as OA (Ilva 2017), including OA
publication channels, hybrid OA channels, and parallel publishing. In 2017, the share of
OA publications had increased to roughly 40 %, and in 2018 the share exceeded 50 %
(Ilva 2019, Figure 2). The increase has occurred in all forms of OA (gold, hybrid,
28

Malin Fredriksson 2020

parallel), but the largest increase occurred in the share or parallel published publications
(Ilva 2019).
Publication Forum is maintained by the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies, and
provides “a classification of publication channels created by the Finnish scientific
community to support the quality assessment of academic research” (Publication Forum
2019). The Publication Forum classification has been used as an indicator of quality to
assess scientific publications produced at Finnish universities in the funding model set
by the MEC since 2015 (Pölönen 2018).
The purpose of the Publication Forum (2019) classification system is to identify reliable
publication series and publishers (level 1) and display those publication channels which
have a larger appreciation and impact in the research community (levels 2 and 3). The
publications are distributed in the following way: 1 = basic level (80% of publication
volume) 2 = leading level (15%), 3 = top level (5%). Publications at level 0 have not
yet been evaluated by the expert panels of Publication Forum, or do not meet the
scientific criteria of Publication Forum. To some extent the publications on level 0 also
entails predatory journals (Publication Forum 2019).
The Publication Forum classification should not be used for evaluating and comparing
individual researchers or publications, but to evaluate publication channels and their
development in their research fields respectively. For example, this means that
individual papers in level 1 journals might be of higher quality and have higher impact
than average, while individual journals in level 2 or 3 journals may be less qualitative
and have less impact than the average in that level. Both in the new and old funding
models, the coefficient of publications at different levels in Publication Forum are the
same (Publication Forum 2019).

29

3. Researchers’ publishing patterns in the changing landscape of
scholarly communication
The adoption of the principles of OA in the scholarly community is shaped by a variety
of factors, such as typical patterns of scholarly publishing in each discipline respectively
(Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015, Rowley et al 2017). This chapter presents previous
research on patterns of scholarly publishing characteristic to various disciplines,
together with an overview of how OA is part of different disciplines. It continues by
reviewing previous research on how researchers’ awareness, knowledge and perceptions
of OA have been examined, and which factors have been assessed as relevant for
researchers in their decisions of where to publish.

3.1.

Patterns of scholarly publishing and OA developments in various
academic disciplines

Across disciplines, different patterns of scholarly publishing have traditionally been
prevalent. This chapter provides an overview of the patterns of scholarly publishing and
how these relate to the development of OA in humanities and other disciplines. As
Puuska (2014) observes in her study on scholarly publishing patterns in different
disciplines in Finnish universities in the beginning of the 2010s, academic institutions
are internally diverse and comprised of many different academic cultures. In addition to
the nature of the topics of research, research conducted in different disciplines have
different aims, audiences and structures of funding.
3.1.1. Characteristic patterns of scholarly publishing in different disciplines
When it comes to publishing patterns, there are differences across disciplines
concerning which kinds of publications are typical and how their statuses are perceived:
whether scientific journals, books or conference proceedings considered the most
important research outlets. In addition, researchers in different disciplines differ in their
perceptions of what good quality publications are, which in turn affect their tendency to
adopt science policy aims (Puuska 2014). Researchers in different academic
environments and disciplines have different ideas about what publishing is about.
30

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Peer reviewed journal articles are the primary literature in the so-called hard sciences. In
natural sciences, journal publishing is the predominant venue for publishing, and in
engineering conference proceedings are a central channel for disseminating the latest
research results. Compared to these disciplines, monographs emerge as an important
form of scholarly publishing in humanities and social sciences (Giménez-Toledo and
Román-Román 2009, Williams et al. 2009). Despite the importance of monographs in
humanities and social sciences from a long-term perspective, journal articles remain the
predominant research output in all disciplines today (Dalton, Tenopir & Björk 2020,
Suber 2012).

3.1.2. Patterns of OA publishing in different disciplines
Patterns of scholarly publishing differ across disciplines, as well as the patters of OA
publishing. The distinctive patterns of scholarly publishing prevalent in different
disciplines have been seen as one contributing factor to why the transition to OA have
been adopted to a varying degree in various disciplines and progressed at different pace
(Eve 2014, Williams et al 2009). The differences across disciplines depends on several
factors and cannot thus be reduced to the decision-making of individual researchers
(Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015, Rowley et al 2017).
Previous studies have identified disciplinary differences in OA publishing. While the
amount of OA journals has grown rapidly in the medical and natural sciences
(Archambault et al 2014), the amount has not been as large in the humanities and social
sciences (Darley & Wickham 2014, Eve 2014).
A central factor connected to the differences in publishing in the humanities and the
sciences are the production costs of books and articles. The production of books is more
expensive than articles, which makes it more difficult to develop business models for
sustainable OA book publishing. The publishers of scholarly articles never pay royalties
to the author, which he further perceives as one of the main reasons why the global OA
movement has had articles as its main concern (Suber 2012). At the same time as the
above mentioned characteristic patterns of scholarly publishing have been observed in
empirical case studies, it should also be noted that variations in these occur are also
related to historical, national and cultural contexts (Kulczycki et al 2018)
31

Malin Fredriksson 2020

In humanities, the OA financing model in which the author pays, is less established than
in sciences overall (Eve 2014, Williams et al 2009). However, in recent years, authorbased funding has become more common also in humanities. In Plan S (2018), it is
mentioned that the transition towards OA for monographs and book chapters is a
separate process which will take a longer time than for achieving OA for scholarly
articles.
Despite several initiatives to increase the production and dissemination of OA books,
the development has been even slower than for OA articles (Eve 2014, Williams et al
2009). Roughly 27, 000 peer reviewed books are available in Directory of Open Access
Books (DOAB 2020). Compared to the number of journals and individual journal
articles available in DOAJ, the number can be considered minor. The majority of
journals in humanities (and social sciences) listed in DOAJ do not charge APCs (DOAJ
2019).

3.2.

Awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of OA among researchers

This sub-chapter presents previous research on awareness, knowledge, and perceptions
of OA among researchers. Across disciplines, there are different patterns of open access
behavior. Previous research pays attention to the relevance of disciplinary cultures and
norms in relation to open access behavior (e.g. Gross & Ryan 2015). It has also been
observed that the level of adoption of OA publishing models is lower in humanities and
social sciences than in sciences, technology and medicine (Coonin & Younce 2010,
Gross and Ryan 2015). At the same time, there are also variations within disciplines.
The proportion of OA publications is rather large in biomedical research and math,
while it is minor especially in engineering, chemistry, and the humanities (Archambault
et al 2014).
Firstly, lack of knowledge is an obvious reason for not choosing to publish OA. In
Gaines’ (2015) case study, faculty reported that they were familiar with OA publishing,
but reported that they did not have practical knowledge on how to publish OA. On the
other hand, another central observation is that familiarity, awareness and knowledge of
OA issues does not automatically result in choices to use various routes to OA.
Fourthly, lack of knowledge may still correspond to positive perceptions of OA
32

Malin Fredriksson 2020

publishing. Gross and Ryan (2015, 85) concluded in their study on humanities and
social sciences that researchers have “limited knowledge about open access practices
and outlets, but great support for the philosophy, tenets, and ethos of the OA
movement”.
As the field of scholarly communication and publishing has undergone a change in the
past few years, it can be assumed that changes occur also among respondents. In their
recent study on attitudes towards OA among scholars in social science and humanities,
Dalton, Tenopir & Björk (2020) found that more than 90 % of think that their fields
would benefit from OA publications.
Lack of knowledge or incorrect understandings of OA publishing affect researchers’
decision-making. For example, when it comes to green OA, researchers tend to
underuse the opportunities to parallel publish since they are not always aware of the
journals’ copyright policies and do not know that they are allowed to parallel publish
(e.g. Laakso & Polonioli 2018). It has also been observed that researchers do not
parallel publish because of lack of time or lack of institutional support, although they
know how to do it and recognize that it would be beneficial for them (e.g. Yang & Li
2015).
The quality of OA journals, and which aspects are included in notions of quality, has
been a widely debated issue. Predatory publishing has been one of the main concerns in
OA publishing. Predatory OA publishers who collect APCs without sending the
manuscripts for peer review are one of the main concerns. The fear of predatory
journals was emphasized in the early days of OA development (Dalton, Tenopir &
Björk 2020, Suber 2012). Especially during the early years of OA publishing, many
scholars thought that OA journals are not peer reviewed at all (Dalton, Tenopir & Björk
2020).
The following aspects of awareness, knowledge and perceptions of OA have been
identified as central to understanding the perspective of the researcher as author:
-

self-reported awareness or knowledge of different forms of OA publishing (gold,
green, hybrids),

-

-

perceptions of institutional support,

-

views on the future of OA.

As the situation of OA has developed at a rapid pace in the past years, studies conducted
in different academic, social and cultural contexts are difficult to compare to each other.
Typically, many studies are case studies whose results cannot be directly transferred to
other contexts.

3.3.

Publication attributes

The relevance of publication attributes is a central topic in studies on researchers’
motivations when choosing venues for publishing their research. Examples of
publication attributes which have been studied (although they to some extent overlap
each other) are relevance in the field of research, perceived reputation and quality,
speed of publication, impact factor, circulation and readership, and attributes related to
the OA status of the publication (Blankstein & Wolff-Eisenberg 2019, Coonan &
Younce 2010, Solomon & Björk 2012, Dalton, Tenopir & Björk 2020, Zhu 2017).
The relevance in the field of research, together with the perceived quality and prestige
of the publication, are the attributes which generally are perceived among the most
important for researchers. Publication choices based on these attributes maintains the
position of journals which are considered prestigious and established in their fields
respectively. In contrast to most of the previously mentioned publication attributes, the
attributes related to the OA status are more seldom considered highly important for
researchers. In addition, this tendency seems to occur despite researchers being aware of
the benefits of publishing gold OA or green OA (Blankstein & Wolff-Eisenberg 2019,
Solomon & Björk 2012, Zhu 2017). Consequently, researchers continue to decide to
publish in traditional subscription journals because of the academic prestige associated
with those journals. For instance, according to the Ithaka S + R US Faculty Survey
2018, faculty members are increasingly interested in OA publishing and positive about
OA publishing models, but only four in ten faculty members report that a journal’s OA
characteristics are highly influential when deciding which journal to publish in
(Blankstein & Wolff-Eisenberg 2019).

34

3.4.

Demographic and other background factors

Awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and intentions to publish OA are also shaped by
demographic or individual factors. In previous studies, demographic factors such as age
and gender, academic position/affiliation (Rodrigues 2014, Zhu 2017) have been
examined as central background factors in the publishing behavior of researchers.
The notion of age can primarily be understood as the researchers’ stage in their
academic career or academic position. Rodrigues (2014) observed that younger
researchers tend to have more positive attitudes towards OA publishing than senior
researchers. Age and academic position have also shown implications for the
perceptions of quality and prestige of publication channels. In Coonin and Younce’s
(2010) study, senior researchers considered OA journals less prestigious than traditional
subscription journals. In contrast, Yang and Li (2015) observed that tenured faculty are
more engaged and interested in OA publishing than the average researcher, which, in
turn, may be explained with external motivation from research funders.
Despite some variations in OA awareness and behaviors have been observed across age
groups and gender, e.g. Rodrigues (2014) also argues that the differences between age
groups and gender should not be considered strong predictors of OA awareness,
motivations and behaviors. However, the stage in researcher’s academic career may
have implications for what kind of services and support researchers need.

3.5.

The role of university libraries and other institutional support

The role of university libraries in scholarly communication is a recent topic in the
debate on how to support OA, both on an institutional level and from the perspective of
researchers (8). Previous studies conducted both in international contexts (KlainGabbay & Shoham 2018) and in Finland (Ala-Kyyny 2018) show that university
libraries have been central in both increasing the level of OA publishing at research
institutions and providing services which support researchers in publishing OA.
A well-established way for university libraries to facilitate a change towards increased
OA is the establishment of institutional repositories (IRs) for parallel publishing (Gross
& Ryan 2015, Narayan & Luca 2016). The purpose of IRs is to provide long-term
archiving of publications, show the university’s research output, and allow greater
35

Malin Fredriksson 2020

visibility for the research (Klain-Gabbay & Shoham 2018, Narayan & Luca 2016). Also
in Finland, university libraries have taken an active role in facilitating parallel
publishing, especially by maintaining institutional repositories and supporting
researchers in the self-archiving procedures, but in addition to the existence of IRs,
researchers need to be motivated to parallel publish (Ala-Kyyny 2018, Björk et al 2014,
Kim 2011). In IRs, publications published in full OA channels as well as the parallel
published versions which otherwise would be closed access, are deposited. In the
Finnish context, the IRs maintained by the universities also have a financial dimension.
The publications reported to the IRs are utilized as part of the national publication
collection to the MEC. The reported publications constitute the basis for the university’s
state funding.
Opportunities to funding for APCs is another example of how institutional aspects and
level of research infrastructure affect researchers’ decision-making when choosing
publication channels (Zhu 2017). In Finland, researchers affiliated to universities whose
libraries are part of the FinElib consortium, which negotiate access agreements with
publishers, can benefit from the OA deals through transformative agreements (FinElib
2020). Researchers can also include APC costs in their project budgets when applying
for research funding from Academy of Finland (2020).

4. Research design and methods
The present study is designed as a case study. In this chapter, background information
of the case organization, Åbo Akademi University, is presented. Next, the purpose and
structure of the case study design, as well as the choices of data collection methods and
analysis are described. For the scope of the study, two different data collection methods
were conducted: to map the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities at ÅAU in
relation to other disciplines, a quantitative analysis of publication data was conducted.
In addition, a quantitative questionnaire was conducted at the Faculty of Arts,
Psychology and Theology to map the views and experiences of OA publishing among
researchers in humanities.

4.1.

Presentation of the case organization: Åbo Akademi University

ÅAU is a Swedish-speaking university in Finland which have 1,100 employees, of
which 650 in teaching and research, and 650 postgraduate students (ÅAU 2019). ÅAU
consists of four faculties: the Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology; the Faculty of
Education and Welfare Studies; the Faculty of Social Sciences, Business and
Economics; the Faculty of Science and Engineering. The humanities subjects at ÅAU
are distributed in five study programmes: the Study Programme for Culture, History and
Philosophy; the Study Programme for Languages, the Study Programme for Theology;
the Study Programme for Psychology; the Study Programme for Language Pathology.
The first open science policy of ÅAU was launched in March 2017. The open science
policy can be considered an important action to strategically strengthen researchers’
opportunities to utilize the different routes to OA and enhancing the profile of the
university. The ÅAU policy for open science (2017) also includes guidelines for peer
reviewed OA publishing, formulated as follows:
1. Scientists at Åbo Akademi publish their research in peer-reviewed
scientific publications of high quality within their own discipline. As
scientific publications are considered articles in scientific journals,
serials, books, conference publications, reprints and theses for Master’s
degree, licentiate degree and doctoral degree.

37

Malin Fredriksson 2020

2. Scientific publications produced at Åbo Akademi University are made
as openly available as possible, considering the publisher’s terms and
conditions, as well as current legislation and agreements.
3. Åbo Akademi University recommends publishing in peer reviewed
Open Access journals of high quality (i.e. gold open access).
4. Scientific publications are published as open access in the Åbo
Akademi University Library archive always when the publisher’s terms
and conditions allow this (i.e. green open access).
The first point makes the claim that researchers are expected to publish in peer reviewed
publications of high quality, within each discipline respectively. The first point does not
explicitly mention OA alternatives, since OA is catered in points 2–4. With regards to
the routes to OA, the open science policy clearly includes both gold OA and green OA.
Furthermore, the aim is to make research outputs as openly available as possible,
according to the publisher’s terms and conditions. Although the policy clearly takes a
stand for OA to encourage researchers to choose OA routes when publishing, the
decision-making remains in the hands of researchers.
Openness in science and research, including OA publishing, were included in ÅAU’s
“Breaking boundaries. Goals and strategies 2015–2020” and is mentioned in the new
strategy for the years 2021–2030 called “Åbo Akademi – det havsnära
bildningsuniversitetet”, which will come into effect in the beginning of 2021.
Similarly, as in other universities, the ÅAU library and the research services have
intensified their services and support for researchers in OA issues. In the final report
Atlas of Open Science and Research in Finland (2019), issued by the MEC, the
openness of Finnish institutions in higher education is evaluated. The report maps best
practices among Finnish higher education institutions, research institutes, researchfunding organizations, academic and cultural institutes abroad and learned societies and
academies in 2019. The evaluation was conducted by using different indicators: 1)
Strategic Steering, 2) Policies and Principles, 3) Supporting Openness, 4) Competence
Development, and the participating organizations were arranged in a hierarchy of
maturity level. Although the report does not evaluate the quality of the work, it can be
used to identify potential problem areas. In the report, ÅAU is ranked on maturity level
38

Malin Fredriksson 2020

5 of 5, labelled as “Strategic” (Forsström et al 2019). Based on the report, it could be
assumed that the measures taken at ÅAU to facilitate a transition towards increased OA
have been extensive.

4.2.

The case study design

Case studies can largely be characterized as in-depth studies of particular situations,
organizations, or kinds of events or as studying a contemporary phenomenon in its reallife context (Yin 2014). When choosing the case study design, the definition and choice
of case, data collection methods and methods for analysis are tailored to follow the aim
of research and the research questions. Since the overall research aim is to examine the
transition from closed access publishing to OA publishing in formal scholarly
communication in the humanities, it is useful to illustrate this development by
approaching a particular organization. Moreover, as the aim includes both examining
the institutional perspective of publishing patterns and the perspective of researchers,
more than one data collection method is needed.
When selecting and defining the ‘case’ in the first place, there are several criteria for
selection to consider, as this serves as a limitation for the study. According to Korzilius
(2010b, 3), the rationale for case selection can be framed in a number of different ways:
the case can be selected to critically test a theory, or to illustrate an extreme, unique case
whose exceptionality makes it worth studying, or to choose a typical case that captures
the characteristics of everyday situations. These categorizations can be considered ideal
types and the choice of case for the present study can rather be considered a mixture of
two of them: the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities differs from those in
other disciplines and is in that sense unique and exceptional, while humanities also
represent a typical case in the sense that the object of study is one of the core activities
in academia overall – peer reviewed publishing.
Another critical issue is whether to select the single case study approach or multiple
case study approach. The advantage of a single case study is that the focus is on
providing a detailed description and analysis to map the understanding of the
phenomena of interest or the object of study from different perspectives. In contrast, the
advantage of a multiple case study is that it enables cross-case analysis to shed light on
both similarities and differences in the cases selected (Creswell & Creswell 2018). For
39

Malin Fredriksson 2020

the scope of the present study, the single case study design is primarily selected to
provide an in-depth examination into the publishing patterns and views on and
experiences of OA publishing in humanities at ÅAU.
The single case study design, with a focus on humanities, does not allow a
comprehensive comparison with the publishing patterns or views on and experiences of
OA publishing in other disciplines. However, the main characteristic patterns of
scholarly publishing in other disciplines are mapped to contextualize the situation in
humanities. Therefore, publishing patterns in humanities are examined in relation to
those in other disciplines.
The case study approach further operates at different levels: a descriptive, interpretative
and evaluative level (Yin 2014). The present study can be considered both interpretative
and evaluative. The notion of interpretative means that the focus is on interpreting the
obtained data in relation to the context and previous studies. The evaluative dimension
means that the obtained data which form the analysis is used to evaluate the situation or
the object of study. The interpretative and evaluative dimensions of the case study are
included in the analysis chapter and the discussion chapter.
4.2.1. A quantitative approach
The main methodological choice concerns the choice between quantitative and
qualitative methods, and an assessment whether they are fruitful for responding to the
research questions. While qualitative methods are used to gain deep and versatile
knowledge on a subject, quantitative methods are used to gain larger amounts of
information concerning a specific topic (Creswell & Creswell 2018). As no previous
studies have been conducted concerning the publishing patterns in humanities at ÅAU
or the views and experiences of ÅAU researchers, the option of a mainly quantitative
design is motivated to gain a broad and versatile view of the current state of OA
publishing at ÅAU.
Although the case study design is motivated for the scope of the study and quantitative
methods a proper approach to collect data, case study methodology is more often
associated with qualitative methods for data collection. As Korzilius (2010a, 2010b)
notes, a quantitative approach is usually not considered the conventional
methodological approach in case studies, but it may still be useful. When quantitative
methods are used in case studies, it should be observed that further mentions, “the ideal
40

Malin Fredriksson 2020

(in case studies) is to realize not statistical generalization but analytical generalization,
to be able to generalize results to a broader theory” Korzilius (2010b, 7). In other words,
this means that the results cannot be generalized to all ÅAU researchers at the faculty,
or even researchers within a given study programme or subject. As the purpose of the
study is to map the views and experiences of researchers and an overview of the
publishing patterns in humanities at ÅAU, the main contribution of this study can be
considered empirical.
According to Korzillius (2010b), it should be observed that the function of quantitative
analysis in case studies differ from other quantitative research designs which follow a
more linear pattern (e.g. used for predicting behaviours). Case studies are often
characterized as a process, and therefore the data collection and data analysis are less
pre-determined and can be adapted to the need to describe and explain the topic of study
in its context. The limits of the quantitative analysis “must be considered within the
frame of the case study design, examining a phenomenon in its real-life context”
(Korzillius 2010b, 762). Taking this into consideration in the research design, the new
insights to be gained are assessed as more important than the opportunities for
(statistical) generalization.
4.2.2. A multi-method approach
A typical trait of case studies is that more than one method are used for data collection
and analysis (Creswell & Creswell 2018). Also for the present case study, a multimethod approach is chosen. As the term suggests, a multi-method approach uses more
than one method (at minimum two methods) of data collection. The multi-method
approach enables examining the research target from different methodological
perspectives, and thus provides a broad basis for retrieving diverse and extensive
results. A multi-method approach further enables answering to separate but closely
linked research questions (Creswell 2018). Since the scope of the study can be
considered broad, this is an advantage which further motivates applying two separate
methods.
In the literature review, the main characteristic patterns of scholarly publishing were
identified and compared to those in other disciplines (e.g. Puuska 2014, Williams et al
2009). To respond to the question 1) Which patterns of scholarly publishing are typical
to humanities in general and how is OA part of those patterns, the method chosen for
41

Malin Fredriksson 2020

the case study is analysis of publication data. By applying a quantitative analysis of
publication data, the following sub-questions will be examined:


How large is the share of peer reviewed OA publications produced in
humanities, compared to other disciplines?



Which routes to OA and other publication characteristics are typical to
publications in humanities, compared to other disciplines?

Based on the results, the enablers and barriers in the transition are assessed. Since the
aim is also to examine the transition towards OA from the perspective of researcher, a
survey is conducted at the Faculty of Arts, Psychology and Theology. The second
research question is 2) What is the level of awareness and knowledge of OA publishing
among researchers in the humanities and how do they perceive of OA publishing? This
question is, in turn, divided into sub-questions:


To what extent do researchers report awareness and knowledge of
different forms of OA publishing?



To what extent do they have experience of OA publishing?



What are their perceptions of OA publishing?



Which are the main factors that would support FHPT researchers in
publishing OA and which are the main factors that hinder them from
publishing OA?

The quantitative survey is chosen since it can be used to collect structured information
of a specific group of people (population) and how that population perceives a particular
phenomenon, and how common that phenomenon is among the selected population
(Creswell & Creswell 2018). Moreover, the quantitative approach allows collecting data
of a larger number of respondents, compared to qualitative approaches. In quantitative
studies, different aspects of the research problem are measured to understand the
relation to other variables. For that reason, data collected for those purposes are
quantifiable (Creswell & Creswell 2018).
According to Creswell and Creswell (2018), multi-method approaches build on different
ways to understand the relation between different types of data. The understanding and
use of data can be categorized as triangulation, complementary, development, initiation
or expansion. In the present study, the use of two different methods is primarily
assessed as complementary in relation to each other: they shed light on different aspects
42

Malin Fredriksson 2020

of the phenomenon of scholarly publishing. The use of multi-methods further mean that
the sub-projects are planned independently of each other and are intended to answer a
particular sub-question. Together, the methods should provide a versatile range of
insights into the topic (Creswell & Creswell 2018).
For the purpose of research, two different methods are chosen. In research on patterns of
scholarly publishing and researchers’ productivity, publication data originating from
Current Research Information Systems are used (e.g. Kulczycki & Korytkowski 2020).
To map the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities at ÅAU, publication data is
retrieved and analyzed. The method of collecting publication data, by utilizing the
national publication database Virta, and the characteristics of the data are described in
section Data collection 1. The publication data represents official statistics which are
used in the universities’ funding model. The reported publication data can be considered
an indicator of actual open access behaviour. To map FHPT researchers’ views on and
experiences of OA publishing, a survey is conducted. The survey method is described in
Chapter 4.3. The presentation of the two data collection methods does not reflect the
practical work order, as the two data collections have been conducted parallel to each
other.

4.3.

Data collection 1: ÅAU publication data

The quantitative analysis of publishing patterns is based on publication data. This
chapter presents the features of universities’ publication data, the Virta publication
information service and its user interface Juuli, which provided bibliographic data
services.
4.3.1. Presentation of the publication data in the Virta database
The publication data freely available in the national publication database Virta has been
obtained from the universities and other research organizations as part of the annual
publication data collection conducted by the Ministry of Education and Culture (Ilva
2019). The research organizations report publications produced by their staff into the
database Virta, which is maintained by CSC, the IT Center for Science, a center of
expertise in information technology owned by the Finnish state and higher education
institutions. The publication data provided in Virta originates from the Current Research
43

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Information Systems (CRIS) used at the research institutions. At the time this study was
conducted, the CRIS used at ÅAU was Converis, called Artur. Researchers at ÅAU are
asked to report their publications into Artur and the publications are checked and
validated by librarians. In the validation process, publication data and OA availability
are controlled to avoid any incorrect information about the publication. The publication
data in Virta is transferred every night to the Juuli user interface, which is maintained by
the National Library of Finland. The publication data is freely available through the user
interface Juuli.
4.3.2. The features of the publication data
The annual publication data collections follow the definitions provided by the MEC in a
handbook (e.g. Tiedonkeruun käsikirja 2018). The publication data includes
bibliographic data, author data and background institution data. Below the features of
the bibliographic data are presented: year, authorship, publication type, OA status.
Year
The universities may report publications up to two years after they have been published,
which means that publications published in 2018 may not have been reported until the
publication collection in 2020. For that reason, the available publication data of 2019 is
assessed as preliminary at the time of conducting this study, and the publication data of
2018 is therefore selected as the object of study. As the quantitative analysis based on
publication data focuses on the year 2018, the standards defined in the handbook for the
year 2018 is followed (Tiedonkeruun käsikirja 2018). At the time of the study, the
publication data for 2018 was available through Juuli, and had been validated by ÅAU
librarians and the MEC. As the publication data in Virta is continuously subject to
change, to avoid any miscalculations and misinterpretations due to changes in the
publication data, the data sets retrieved (24–25.3.2020) for this study were checked in
May 2020.
Authorship
Publications are often written by several authors, sometimes affiliated to different
universities. This means the present study analyzes publications for which at minimum
one researcher affiliated to ÅAU has been registered as a co-author. The publication
data of affiliated researchers at all academic levels and with different kinds of
44

Malin Fredriksson 2020

employment or affiliations is included: doctoral students (both salaried and those on
scholarships), university teachers, project researchers, post-doc researchers, professors
etc. The publications of associate professors (“docents”) are excluded from the national
publication collection, since their publications are not reported as ÅAU publications. In
co-authored publications between researchers with different university affiliations, the
publications may occur in the data as duplicates (Tiedonkeruun käsikirja 2018).
Publication types
The national publication collection concerns both peer reviewed publications and nonpeer reviewed publications (intended for other than primarily academic audiences).
Since the present study concerns peer reviewed publications only, the focus is limited to
publication types A and C, whose sub-types are listed in Table 1 (Julkaisutiedonkeruu
2018: Käsitteet ja määrittelyt). Publication type A includes peer reviewed scientific
articles, and C includes scientific books (monographs).

Table 1. Peer reviewed publication types according to the MEC (Julkaisutiedonkeruu
2018).
PUBLICATION TYPES (PEER REVIEWED)
A Peer reviewed scientific articles
A1 Journal article (refereed), original research
A2 Review article, Literature review, Systematic review
A3 Book section, Chapters in research books
A4 Conference proceedings
C Scientific books (monographs)
C1 Book
C2 Book (editor), chapters in research books, conference
proceedings or special issue of a journal

Publication type C2 refers to editorship, which implies that publications reported in this
publication type does not reflect authorship as such. However, publications in C2
constitute a central part of the publishing pattern in humanities, and is for that reason
included in the present study.
45

Malin Fredriksson 2020

4.3.3. The OA status of publications
The OA status of the publications is one of the features reported by research
organizations. In the handbook for publication data collection (Julkaisutiedonkeruu
2018), the OA status is defined by the guidelines provided by the MEC. It should be
observed that these definitions may be narrower or broader in scope that the definitions
discussed in Chapter 2. In the handbook for publication data collection, the OA status of
publications is defined by the following guidelines (below as summarized by Ilva,
2019):
● The publication is freely available to read, but a license (such as CC BY) which
defines the re-use of the publication is not mandatory.
● The publication is openly available in the publisher’s channel (in a full gold OA
channel or in a hybrid journal) AND/OR it can be parallel published in an open
repository (green OA). The parallel publishing of publications which originally
have been made available in the publisher’s channel result in an overlap between
the OA statuses (full OA, hybrid, green OA), which complicated the retrieval
and interpretation of OA availability.
● For parallel published publications embargoes are accepted, but in case it is
published in the publisher’s channel, the access needs to be immediate. Delayed
(full) OA is not considered viable OA in the national publication collection at
the time of conducting this study.
● Parallel publishing in an institutional repository (provided by the university) or a
discipline-specific repository are equally accepted as green OA.
● The dissemination of publications on a research project’s website or in academic
social networks (ASNs) provided by commercial actors, such as ResearchGate
and Academia.edu, are not considered viable OA.
● The OA version of the publication needs to be peer reviewed. The pre-print
version (which the author has submitted to the journal) is not peer reviewed, and
thus it does not meet the criteria of MEC. The final version of the author or of
the publisher are peer reviewed, and thereby meet the criteria of OA.

46

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Figure 1. The OA status options in the Juuli user interface.

Since 2016, two separate fields used in the data collection process, also visible in the
research portal Juuli, have been used to indicate the OA status of each publication
(Figure 1). One of the fields indicates whether the publication has been made available
in a full gold OA channel or in a hybrid journal (Other OA), while the other field
indicates whether the publication has been deposited into an institutional repository or
other relevant subject repository (green OA) (Ilva 2017, 2019). To validate the OA
status of the publications, the URLs of the different versions of the publications are
collected.
As observed by Ilva (2017), the OA statuses of the publications to some extent overlap,
as publications which originally have been published in full gold OA channels or in
hybrid journals may also have been parallel published in the university’s repository or a
subject-specific repository. These publications are available both at the publisher’s
website and as parallel published in the institutional repository/national publication
database. Because of the overlap, the additional benefit of green OA needs to be
calculated separately. The category green OA+ is used to indicate the additional benefit
of green OA. The number of green OA + publications is counted by subtracting the
number of publications which have been both published in a gold OA channel or in a
hybrid journal, from the total number of parallel published publications (Ilva 2017,
2019). Publications indicated as green OA+ are not available in gold OA or hybrid
journals.

47

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Fields of science
The publications reported to Virta by the universities are categorized according to the
division of fields of science as defined by Statistics Finland (2010):
1 Natural sciences
2 Engineering and technology
3 Medical and health Sciences
4 Agricultural sciences
5 Social sciences
6 Humanities
All fields of science, except of agricultural science, were represented among ÅAU
publications in 2018. It should be observed that the fields of science provided by
Statistics Finland do not follow the structures of subjects and faculties of the
universities. For instance, this means that researchers affiliated to FHPT may produce
scientific works which are categorized in social sciences, and researchers in other
faculties which produce scientific works which are categorized in humanities in the
publication collection. In the sub-study, the terms discipline and field of science are
used interchangeably (the term field of science is used when referring to the category
used in publication data).
Publication Forum classification
Publication Forum is a classification system, which operates under the Federation of
Finnish Learned Societies, and is intended to support the quality assessment of research
output (Publication Forum 2019. The publication’s classification in Publication Forum
is automatically added to the publication data (1=basic, 2=leading, 3=top) after the
university’s reporting. In Juuli, publication channels marked with a hyphen (-) in the
search results represent level 0, which include both unranked channels and channels
regarded as non-scientific (to some extent also predatory journals). If a publication has
no marking, the publication channel is under evaluation and has not yet received a
classification in Publication Forum. Currently, OA journals are evaluated on the same
basis as traditional closed publication channels (Publication Forum 2020).

4.3.4

Search strategies for retrieval of ÅAU publication data in 2018

This section describes the search strategies conducted in Juuli to retrieve the ÅAU
publication data of 2018. The search strategies for retrieving ÅAU publication data for
2018, with a particular focus on the OA availability of the publications, are based on
Ilva’s (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020a, 2020b) descriptions and methods of data retrieval.
The first step in mapping the patterns of scholarly publishing at ÅAU is to retrieve the
publication data of all fields of science of peer reviewed publications produced in 2018.
The search criteria Institution, and 2018 for Year of publication were used in all

49

Malin Fredriksson 2020

searches, and therefore not mentioned in the documentation of all search strategies
described below.
Search strategy 1:

Peer review in A, all fields of science & peer review in C, all
fields of science

This search strategy retrieves the number of peer reviewed publications in each field of
science. The results of the advanced search were filtered according to field of science:
natural sciences, engineering and technology, medicine and health sciences, humanities,
and social sciences, to show the number of publications type A and C in each field of
science. The publication data of all fields of science is retrieved to provide the context
of scholarly publishing at ÅAU.
Search strategy 2:

Publication types in all fields of science

The number of publications in all publication types A1, A2, A3, A4, and C1, C2 were
retrieved separately, and the total number of publications in each field of science was
documented. The result of this search strategy is intended to show the differences of
publishing patterns in different fields of science, in particular the differences between
humanities and other fields of science.
Search strategy 3:

OA status of publications in A1–A4, according to field of science

Publication type A is the main venue for publishing in all fields of science. The OA
status of publications in all fields of science is retrieved to show the differences between
different fields of science, in particular between the humanities and other fields of
science. The OA status of publications was retrieved by examining each field of science
and publication sub type (A1, A2, A3, A4) individually and documenting the OA status
(gold OA channel, other OA availability, green OA) in each of them. In addition, the
proportion of additional parallel publishing (indicated as green OA+ to remark the
additional value of parallel publishing) was retrieved by sorting out and excluding those
publications which were available both in the publisher’s channel and in a repository.
To confirm the proportion of publications which are not available as OA at all, the
number of gold OA, other OA and green OA+ were subtracted from the total number of
publications in each publication type.

Search strategy 4: OA status in different publication types, humanities
In this search strategy, the focus shifts to the humanities only to examine the OA status
of publications in different publication types (A and C) in humanities. The OA status is
retrieved by conducting the search for each publication type individually and
documenting the number of publications and their OA status (gold OA channel, other
OA availability, green OA+) in each publication type separately.
Search strategy 5: Publication Forum classification in publication type A1–A4, all
fields of science
By using this search strategy, the distribution of Publication Forum classification across
all fields of science is examined. The search is limited to publication type A, since type
C is not prevalent in other fields of science than humanities and social sciences (as
examined by search strategy 1). The share of publications in each Publication Forum
class (1–3) is retrieved by first retrieving all publications in publication type A for each
field of science individually. For each field of science, the number of publications in
each Publication Forum class is documented. Publications classified at level 0 (-), and
those unranked in Publication Forum, are not included in the total number of
publications in each field of science.
Search strategy 6: Routes to OA at different Jufo levels in publication type A, in all
field of science
This search strategy is conducted to examine which routes to OA (gold OA channel,
other OA availability, green OA+) are used for publication type A at different Jufo
levels (1–3). All publications in all fields of science categorized as A1–A4 are retrieved
for each OA status individually. Simultaneously as the OA status is examined, the
numbers of publications in each Jufo level are documented.
Search strategy 7: Routes to OA at different Jufo levels in A, humanities
This search strategy is conducted to examine which routes to OA are used at different
Jufo levels in humanities (A1–A4). First, all publications in A in humanities are
retrieved. The OA status of those publications are examined individually, and the
number of publications in Jufo 1–3 are documented.
When checking the OA status of the publications by searching the original publication
on the publisher’s website, the VPN and university credentials were not in use, ensuring
51

Malin Fredriksson 2020

that these would not give access to subscription channels. To control the reliability,
consistency and quality of the publication data, the different versions of the data sets
acquired by using the search strategies documented above, have been compared with
each other to ensure their correctness. The dates for retrieving the publication data and
the search strategies used are documented in separate Excel files, to identify the
potential changes over time. The last version was used for analysis of publishing
patterns and is presented in the results in Chapter 6.

Data collection 2: Survey on FHPT researchers’ views on and
experiences of OA publishing

The publication data retrieved by using Juuli, as described in the chapter above, can be
used for mapping the patterns of scholarly publishing, but to gain insight into the
researchers’ experiences of and views on OA publishing, an additional data collection
method is needed. A survey is an efficient method to reach a large number of
respondents within a limited time frame. Another benefit of the survey method is that it
collects structured data, as all informants receive exactly the same questions.
Consequently, comparisons can be made across different respondent groups (Creswell
& Creswell 2018).
A survey is a method for systematically gathering information from a population on a
certain topic. Surveys are used to measure the frequencies with which the sample
population experiences certain aspects of a defined phenomenon (Creswell 2018). In
case study research, surveys are used to identify characteristics of a population by
asking questions related to the topic of study. To map FHPT researchers’ views on and
experiences of OA publishing, conducting an online survey is thus an appropriate
method for collecting data.
Surveys are used to examine individuals’ self-reported knowledge, opinions and
behaviors. Another limitation which relates to the role of social reality is that
participants not only report what they think themselves, their responses may also reflect
what they think that the researcher anticipates (Creswell & Creswell 2018). Although
quantitative methods previously have been seen to represent an objective reality, it has
been increasingly acknowledged that also the use of quantitative methods and
52

Malin Fredriksson 2020

interpretation of quantitative results are shaped by social reality. All phases of the
research process, starting from the definition of research aims and questions, to the
research design and construction of measurement tools and the interpretation of results
are shaped by the expectations of the researchers, the features of the data sources, and
the informants (Creswell 2018).
4.4.1. Population and sampling
The choice of population and sampling are critical to successfully receive responses
which cover the research aim and questions. Researchers affiliated to the Faculty of
Arts, Psychology and Theology constitute the population of the present study. The
category of researcher includes all individuals at all career levels who conduct research
as part of their work: doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, university teachers,
professors. Ideally, all researchers affiliated to the faculty (the population) would
constitute the sample, but in practice, there is no guarantee that all individuals can be
reached.
The survey was open 7.4–29.4.2020 and distributed online via e-mailing lists only (both
general and subject-specific) to FHPT staff, researchers and doctoral students. The
invitation to participate was also shared via the staff newsletter, and a link to the survey
was posted in FHPT-related groups on Facebook and Yammer which is used for ÅAU
internal communication.
One of the challenges in survey studies is to attract informants of different backgrounds
and experiences to participate. In the cover letter, also researchers who did not have
experience of OA publishing were encouraged to participate in the survey.
4.4.2. The structure of the survey
The survey questions and measurement items are derived and adapted from previously
used surveys. The present survey is adapted from Gaines’ (2015) study “From
Concerned to Cautiously Optimistic: Assessing Faculty perceptions and Knowledge of
Open Access in a Campus-Wide Study”. The survey was constructed by using the
online survey tool SurveyMonkey. The entire survey is attached in Appendix 1.
The survey consists of a total of 20 questions distributed on ten different pages in the
survey. The question items are used to measure to what extent respondents disagree or
agree with statements on the principles of OA and perceived benefits of OA publishing.
53

Malin Fredriksson 2020

In the survey, questions 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are constructed in a 7-point Likert scale
(1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree, or 1=extremely irrelevant, 7= extremely
relevant) to measure the perceived awareness, knowledge and perceptions of OA
publishing. In contrast to Gaines’ (2015) study, where a 4-point scale was used, a 7point grade scale was used in the present study to make the scale more sensitive to
differences in the data. In addition, the order of the questions of the original survey was
re-arranged to appear more logical for the respondent. Since the original survey was
used in another educational context, items E, F and G in Q1, item L in Q7, and items A,
C, E in Q10 were modified and/or added to fit the Finnish conditions and ÅAU as an
institution. Moreover, item F in Q11 on the future of OA was added due to the outbreak
of the COVID-19 crisis which coincided with the data collection. As the original study
did not consider perceptions of parallel publishing, questions and items concerning
parallel publishing were added to the survey.
For questions 6, 12, 13, ranking scales were used to measure the respondents’
preferences. The background information of respondents (age, gender, academic
position, study programme/subject) was collected at the end of the survey. In addition,
the respondents were asked to choose their study programme and subject, but also an
“Do not want to tell” option was available. The respondents’ subject affiliations were
mainly used to map the outreach of the survey across different subjects and groups of
respondents. Thus, reminders could be sent out more efficiently to the e-mailing lists to
reach the less represented participant groups.
The survey consists of 18 closed-ended questions, but two open-ended questions are
included in the end of the survey. These responses in the open-ended questions are
thematically coded and some examples are included in the presentation of results. As
these responses are qualitative in nature, they are used to nuance the responses in the
closed-ended part of the survey. The qualitative results are also used for triangulation to
validate responses of the closed-ended questions.
In order to test the readability, consistency and transparency of the questions, a pilot
study was conducted among five participants with varying academic background and
experience, as well as variating knowledge of OA. The survey was adjusted before
distribution to the target population.
54

Malin Fredriksson 2020

The quantitative data retrieved from the survey is analyzed and presented as descriptive
statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data (of the
sample and the measures) (Creswell & Creswell 2018). The measurements used are
(frequency) distribution, central tendency (mean, median), and dispersion (standard
deviation, SD). To analyze and describe the relationship between two categorical
variables, cross-tabulation is used.

4.5.

Ethical considerations and research data management

Issues regarding research ethics were taken into consideration in both sub-studies at all
stages of the research process: in the research design, the data collection, management
of research data, analysis, presentation of results, and data archiving.
The publication data, which consists of bibliographic data, retrieved from the national
publication database Virta, is publicly available data. The publication data has been
reported by researchers and universities, and do not contain sensitive personal data.
Consequently, the data retrieval, analysis, presentation of results, and archiving, do not
violate the integrity of individuals. For the purpose of the thesis, only numerical data
which relates to the share of publication types and OA status are relevant. The
publication data retrieved from Virta, by using the Juuli interface, will be deposited and
made openly available in the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSSDA) for future
use. The procedures of data retrieval and processing are documented according to the
instructions of FSSDA to guarantee the reliability and validity of data (FSD guidelines
for depositing data 2020).
The collection and management of survey data bring to the fore several ethical
concerns, as the collected data includes personal data. Participation in the online survey
was anonymous, and the potential respondents were informed about this in the cover
letter. Thus, all participants in the survey have given their informed consent. The main
ethical concern in the management of survey data and in archiving was that the small
size of subject units and respondent groups could potentially reveal the identity of the
respondents. Therefore, the option of “Do not want to tell” was added as a response
option in the survey where respondents were asked to opt their study programme and
subject. For the presentation of results and data archiving, the data was further
55

Malin Fredriksson 2020

anonymized. Subject units and respondent groups which consisted of only few
respondents are not presented as such, but grouped together to represent larger units of
respondents. The anonymized research data retrieved by the survey will be deposited
and made openly available in FSSDA for future use. The respondents were informed in
the cover letter that anonymized survey data will be archived in FSSDA. The
procedures of data retrieval and processing are documented according to the instructions
of FSSDA to guarantee the reliability and validity of data (FSD guidelines for
depositing data 2020).

5. Results
The presentation of results is divided into sub-study I and sub-study II. First, the
analysis of the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities (2018) in relation to other
fields of science at ÅAU is presented. After mapping the patterns of scholarly
publishing by using the publication data, the results of the survey are presented. In the
end, the main findings of both sub-studies are summarized.

5.1.

Patterns of scholarly publishing at ÅAU

This sub-chapter analyzes the patterns of scholarly publishing at ÅAU and in
humanities in particular. The main characteristic patterns of publishing in all fields of
science are shortly presented and examined especially in relation to the characteristic
patterns in humanities.
The presentation of the reported publications follows the division of fields of science as
defined by Statistics Finland (2010). It should be observed that these fields of science
do not automatically follow the division of faculties and subjects at universities. This
further means that researchers affiliated to FHPT may produce publications which are
reported in other fields of science, and similarly, researchers at other faculties may
produce publications which are reported in the humanities category.
For the analysis of reported peer reviewed publications, the publication data of
publications produced by ÅAU researchers was retrieved from the national publication
database Virta by using the advanced search function in the user interface Juuli as
described in chapter 4.3.4. The search was limited to the peer reviewed publications
type A (journal articles) and C (monographs), publication year 2018, produced at ÅAU.
The data was retrieved 26.3.2020, 10.5.2020, and 17.5.2020 and finally verified
23.8.2020. The data presented in this chapter represent the last version of the data
retrieval.
5.1.1. Patterns of scholarly publishing in all fields of science
In total 1016 peer reviewed publications in all fields of science of publication types A
and C were published by researchers at ÅAU in 2018. The amount of publications in
57

Malin Fredriksson 2020

each field of science is displayed in Figure 3. The results displayed in Figure 3 were
retrieved by conducting search strategy 1 described in the method section. The largest
number of publications were produced in natural sciences (312), followed by social
sciences (280), and humanities (192).
Figure 3. The amount (N) of peer reviewed publications (A and C) at ÅAU (2018), all
fields of science.

Figure 3 also shows the proportions of publications in categories A and C in each field
of science. In humanities, a total of 192 publications had been reported, of which 147
publications were reported as journal articles (A) and 45 as books or edited works (C).
As indicated also indicated in Figure 3, the proportion of publications in type C is
largest in the humanities. Of the 45 publications in C in humanities, 6 were books (C1)
and 39 were edited chapters in research books, conference proceedings or special issue
of a journal (C2). It should be noted that editorship is not equal to authorship, but C2 is
included in the analysis of patterns of scholarly publishing since the number of
publications in C2 constitutes a central difference in the publishing pattern in
humanities, compared to other fields of science.

58

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Figure 4. The proportions of publication types (A1–A4, C1–C2) in all fields of science.

Figure 4 shows the proportions of publications and distribution of publication types
(A1–A4 and C1–C2) in all fields of science. The number mentioned in the parenthesis
in each field of science indicates the total number of publications in that particular field.
The results displayed in Figure 4 were retrieved by conducting search strategy 2
described in the method section. Publication type A1 (journal article) is predominant in
all fields of science. Notably, the proportion of publications in A1 is smallest in
humanities (42%), while the share is about 20 percent larger in social sciences (63 %)
and more than double in medical and health sciences (88 %). In contrast, the largest
share (29 %) of publications in A3 (book sections) is in humanities, and social sciences
is in second place (22 %). In other fields of science, the share of publications in A3 is
significantly smaller (5 percent or less). Humanities also distinctly show the largest
share of publications as monographs and edited works, C1 (3 %) and C2 (20 %),
compared to other fields of science.
5.1.2. Routes to OA in the patterns of scholarly publishing
To further examine the patterns of scholarly publishing, the articles (A) in all fields of
science were retrieved and examined according to their OA status: full gold OA
publication channel, other OA (most often hybrid), parallel published, and not OA
(closed access). Figure 5 displays the OA status of publications in categories A1–A4
(journal articles) in all fields of science. The number mentioned in parenthesis indicates
the total number of publications in that field of science. As the amount of publications
in C1–C2 is minor in the remaining other fields than humanities, the patterns of OA in
humanities in C1–C2 is examined separately later in this chapter.
59

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Figure 5. The OA status of publications in A1–A4, all fields of science.

Publications in full OA channels (A)
In Figure 5, the label full OA refers to publications where all publications are direct full
OA (gold OA publication channel in Juuli). The share of publications in full OA
publication channels in A1–A4 was the second largest (33 %) in humanities, slightly
less than in medical and health sciences (36 %). The smallest proportion of full OA
channels was found in engineering and technology (14%).
Other OA availability in peer reviewed articles (A)
The category ‘Other OA availability’ refers, according to the definition of MEC, most
often to publications in hybrid journals. As Figure 5 indicates, the smallest proportion of
publications in this category is found in humanities and engineering and technology (7
%) which constitutes a distinct contrast to the largest proportion of Other OA (14 %)
which is found in medical and health sciences.
However, the status Other OA may also include publications which have been made
available after an embargo time defined by the publisher. Delayed gold OA is according
to the MEC definition not proper OA, and thus not considered in the funding model.
Consequently, it can be assumed that these publications have been validated in an
incorrect way in connection to the annual publication collection.
Parallel publishing or green OA in peer reviewed articles (A)
To eliminate the overlap between green OA and gold OA, as noted by Ilva (2017), the
publications which have been reported as full gold OA publications or hybrids and have
60

Malin Fredriksson 2020

been parallel published, are sorted out to indicate the actual benefit of green OA (hence
the label green OA+). The label green OA+ indicates that those publications have been
parallel published only and that is the only way to access the article. The most extensive
additional benefit of parallel publishing is found in natural sciences (21 %) as illustrated
in Figure 5. The smallest proportion of green OA+ is in medical and health sciences (14
%), while the share in humanities is slightly higher (17 %) and thus situated between the
two extremes.
Not OA in peer reviewed articles (A)
The category of not OA (or closed access) refers to publications which are not available
by any route to OA. The shares of publications in A1–A4 which are not available as OA
are also displayed in Figure 5. The largest proportion of closed access publications is
found in engineering and technology (59 %) and natural sciences (45 %), closely
followed by humanities (43 %). The smallest proportion of closed access publications
was found in medical and health sciences (37 %).
The OA status in A and C in humanities
Figure 6 illustrates the OA status in publication types A and C in publications produced
in humanities. As observed also in Figure 4, the categories A3, C1 and C2 emerge as
central to the publishing pattern in humanities. The share of full OA in humanities is
largest in A1, 37 of 79 publications (46 %). Correspondingly, A1 also shows the
smallest share of closed access publications (26 %). In publication type A, the share of
closed access publications is largest in A3 (book sections) (68 %). In A2, only one
publication had been reported, and it was closed access. The additional benefit of
parallel publishing (green OA+) is largest in A4 (22 %), followed by A3 (18 %) and A1
(16 %).

61

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Figure 6. The OA status in different publication types (A1–A4, C1–C2) in humanities.

In C1, of 6 reported publications, one was full OA and 5 were closed access. In C2,
about half of the publications were closed access (20 of 39), while 16 were full OA and
3 hybrids. No publications in C1 and C2 had been parallel published. The largest
proportion of closed access was found in C1 (83 %), C2 (51 %), A3 (68 %).
5.1.3. Publication Forum and OA
The publication’s classification in Publication Forum can be considered as one aspect of
the perceived quality of the publication. In Figure 7, the Publication Forum class
(indicated in the figures as Jufo 1, 2, 3) of publications is examined across all fields of
science in publication types A1–A4. Publications which are not classified in Publication
Forum are not included in the analysis (level 0 and -).
Figure 7. Publication Forum classification, publication type A, all fields of science.

62

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Level 3 is the highest level in Publication Forum. The largest share (13 %) of
publications classified in Jufo 3 is found in social sciences, followed by medical and
health sciences (12 %). The share of publications in Jufo 3 in humanities (9 %) and
natural sciences (8 %) is thus several percent smaller. With regards to level 2, the
largest proportion of publications is found in medical and health sciences (30 %), while
the smallest is in engineering and technology (23 %), followed by humanities (25 %).
The proportion of publications at level 1 is largest in humanities and engineering and
technology (both 66 %), and slightly larger than in natural sciences (65 %). The
smallest proportion of publications at level 1 is found in medical and health sciences (58
%).
Figure 8. Routes to OA at different Jufo levels, publication type A, all fields of science.

Figure 8 illustrates the proportions of different routes to OA at different levels in
Publication Forum. The share of full OA publications is largest (30 %) at level 1, which
is the double amount compared to the 15 % shares at level 2 and 3 respectively. The
share of parallel published publications is largest at level 3 (29 %). The largest share (51
%) of closed access publications is found level 2, while the publications at level 1
indicate the smallest share (41 %) of closed access publications. At level 3, the share of
closed access publications is 46 %. The largest share (16 %) of Other OA (hybrids) was
found at level 2, while the shares were significantly smaller at Jufo 1 and 3.
When the total share of publications which are available as OA in any form is
considered, some differences in OA availability (gold, hybrid, green together) between
the levels in Publication Forum can be observed: in Jufo 1 (59 % available), Jufo 2 (49
%), Jufo 3 (54 %).
63

Malin Fredriksson 2020

In Figure 9, the routes to OA at different Jufo levels in publication types A1–A4 in
humanities, is displayed. The largest share of full OA publications was classified at
level 1 (39 %), while the share was 23 % at level 2. This means that the shares of full
OA publications at level 1and 2 in humanities are considerably larger than the overall
situation as displayed in Figure 8 (all fields of science). In humanities, the proportion of
Other OA at level 2 was 20 %, while no publications were reported at level 3. At level
1, the share was 5 %.
Figure 9. Routes to OA at different Jufo levels, publication type A, humanities.

As Figure 9 indicates, no full OA publications classified at level 3 in humanities. In
humanities, the largest share (73 %) of closed access publications were at level 3, while
the share of closed access was the smallest at level 1 (35 %). The largest benefit of
parallel publishing was achieved at level 3 (27 %). Compared to the situation of all
fields of science together, as displayed in Figure 8, the share of closed access at level 3
is remarkably larger in humanities (73 %) than in all fields of science (46 %). However,
at level 1 and 2 the humanities showed more extensive openness compared to all fields
of science together. For example, at level 1 in humanities, only 35 % were closed access
while the equivalent share in all fields of science together was 41 %.

5.2.

The humanities research community at ÅAU: description of the
participants in the survey

In total 59 respondents at FHPT completed the online survey in April 2020. In addition,
12 respondents who started filling in the survey did not complete it. Thus, the
completion rate among respondents was 83 %. To eliminate the effects of item non64

Malin Fredriksson 2020

response, the incomplete responses are excluded from the analysis and presentation of
results. In total 53 responses were received by the customized survey link distributed
via e-mail, while 6 responses were received by the survey link distributed via Facebook.
5.2.1. Background information: academic position, age, gender
The background information asked at the end of the survey were position, age, gender,
study programme at FHPT, and subject. The distribution of respondents in groups of
different academic positions is displayed in Table 2. The largest group of respondents
were doctoral students (44 %), while the rest of the respondents were distributed across
other categories: postdoctoral researcher, university teacher/lecturer or senior lecturer,
professor (including assistant and associate), and Other. The category Other mainly
included respondents who conduct part-time research or work in tasks which in
different ways involve research.

Next, the age structure of different academic positions is examined. The respondents’
academic positions in different age groups is displayed in Table 3. The majority of the
doctoral students (18) were in the age groups –30 and 31–40, but there were doctoral
students also in the remaining age groups. All postdoctoral researchers and university
teachers, except one respondent, were in the age groups 31–40 or 41–50, while all
professors were older than 41.

In Table 4, the gender distribution among respondents in different positions is
presented. Among the respondents were 34 women and 20 men, and 5 respondents had
chosen the option Other/Do not want to tell. As also indicated in Table 4, female
doctoral students represent the largest group of respondents (16) when both gender and
academic position are considered. The proportion of female respondents was larger than
the share of men in all positions, except for professor, in which the share was equal (6).

As indicated in Table 5, the majority of the respondents were affiliated with the Study
Programme for Culture, History and Philosophy (32), while the respondents in the
Study Programme for Languages, the Study Programme for Theology, the Study
Programme for Psychology, and the Study Programme for Language Pathology together
66

Malin Fredriksson 2020

makes almost an equal number of respondents (27). The distribution of respondents in
each subject is not presented to protect their integrity and anonymity. As many of the
subjects are small units and have few affiliated researchers, the responses of small units
are not presented as such, and are instead combined on the level of study programmes or
demographic groups to ensure the anonymity of the respondents. When participating in
the survey, the respondents had the opportunity of selecting a “Do not want to tell”
option for both study programme and subject.

The distribution of respondents in favor of the Study Programme for Culture, History
and Philosophy is that it has the largest number of staff and researchers, compared to
the other study programmes.
5.2.2. Experiences of OA publishing
The experiences of OA publishing were examined in Q3, Q4, and Q5. The respondents
were asked about their publishing behaviors in the past two years.
In Q3, 30 respondents (51 %) reported they had not published in a gold OA publication
and 19 (32%) reported they had published. Ten respondents (17 %) were not sure
whether they had or not. Table 6 illustrates the proportions of different publishing
behaviors in different groups of respondents. The predominant majority (71 %) of the
professors reported they had published in a gold OA journal in the past two years, while
only 12 % of the doctoral students reported they had. The doctoral students also
represented the largest proportion (23 %) of respondents who were not sure whether
they had published in gold OA journals or not.

In Q4, ten respondents (17 %) reported they had published in a hybrid journal, while the
predominant majority of 45 respondents (76 %) reported they had not published. Four
respondents (7 %) were not sure whether they had or not. The professors represented the
largest group of respondents (36 %) who reported to have published in a hybrid journal
in the past two years, while the proportions in the other respondent groups were
considerably smaller.

In Q5 about parallel publishing, the proportions of those who reported they had parallel
published and those who had not were rather equal: 27 (46 %) and 29 (49 %)
respectively, while 3 respondents (5 %) were not sure. The predominant majority of
professors (86 %) reported that they had parallel published, while doctoral students
represented the largest proportion who had not parallel published (73 %).

5.2.3. Education on OA issues
In Q9, participation in education on OA issues was examined as displayed in Table 9. In
total, 24 % percent had participated in OA education, while 76 % reported they had not.
There was considerable variation in the level of participation in different respondent
groups. Among the professors, 64 % reported they had participated, while the
equivalent was remarkably lower among university teachers (14 %), postdoctoral
researchers (0 %), and doctoral students (12 %).

To examine the relation between participation in OA education and experiences of
hybrid journals, the responses in Q4 was compared to the responses in Q9. As indicated
in Table 11, the proportion of respondents which had both participated in OA education
and published in hybrid journals was 36 %, while the proportion of respondents who
had not participated in education but published was smaller (11 %). Among those who
70

Malin Fredriksson 2020

had participated in education, 64 % reported to not have published in hybrid journals,
while the equivalent share among those who had not participated was 80 %.

To examine the relation between participation in OA education and experiences of
parallel publishing, the responses in Q5 was compared to the responses in Q9, as
presented in Table 12. In Q5, ten of the 14 respondents (71 %) who had participated in
education reported they had parallel published, while 17 of the 45 respondents (38 %)
who had not participated reported that they had parallel published. Conversely, three
respondents (21 %) of those who had participated in OA education, and 26 respondents
(58 %) of those who had not, had not parallel published. 71 % of the respondents who
had participated in education had parallel published, while the equivalent of those who
had not participated was 38 %.

In particular the professors, but also other researchers who have more extensive
academic careers (post doctoral researchers and university lecturers), had also more
extensive experiences of all types of OA publishing (gold OA, green OA and hybrid).
The lower numbers reported by doctoral students can to some extent be explained by
the fact that many of them are in their early careers and have not yet published peer
reviewed publications. In addition, professors and other senior researchers had more
extensively participated in OA education provided by the library. In light of these
observations, it is motivated to examine the awareness, knowledge and perceptions of
OA publishing based on the academic position of respondents.

5.3.

Self-reported awareness and knowledge of OA issues

Q1 in the survey concerns the self-reported awareness and knowledge of OA issues. In
QI, the respondents were asked report to which extent they disagree or agree with eight
different statements (a–h). In Figure 10, the responses are sorted in descending order,
starting with the statement which is most strongly agreed on (weighted average) in all
respondent groups together.
72

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Figure 10. Self-reported awareness and knowledge of OA issues among FHPT
researchers.
Q1. Please rate how strongly you disagree or agree with the following statements:

a)
e)
d)
f)
c)
h)
b)
g)

a) I am familiar with the term ‘open access’
b) I understand the difference between green open access and gold open
access
c) I am familiar with Creative Commons licenses
d) I feel confident that I could explain open access to a colleague if asked
e) I am aware of the Academy of Finland mandate on open access to
publicly funded research
f) I am aware of the ÅAU open science policy
g) I know which version of my paper to upload in ÅAU:s research
repository Artur
h) I know how to find relevant open access publications in which to publish
my research
73

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Statement a) I am familiar with the term open access was most strongly agreed on
among the respondents. In total 90 % of the respondents reported that they slightly
agree, agree or strongly agree on statement a). In other words, it can be assumed that the
predominant majority of the respondents has some previous knowledge and experience
of OA publishing. Similarly, there was a strong agreement on statements d) I feel
confident that I could explain open access to a friend (68 %) and e) I am aware of the
Academy of Finland mandate on open access (66 %). In addition, a clear majority of the
respondents (65 %) reported that they were aware of the ÅAU open science policy (f).
Overall, it can be argued that the respondents reported high level of awareness and
knowledge of OA publishing. All statements received a minimum of 49 % share of
responses as slightly agree, agree or strongly agree.
The following statements received the largest proportions of responses as slightly
disagree, disagree or strongly disagree responses: b) I understand the difference
between green open access and gold open access (48 %), c) I am familiar with Creative
Commons licenses (41 %), g) I know which version of my paper to upload in ÅAU:s
research repository Artur (46 %), and h) I know how to find relevant open access
publications in which to publish my research (36 %).
The largest variability (SD) among the responses is found in statements b) I understand
the difference between green open access and gold open access (SD 2.25), e) I am
aware of the Academy of Finland mandate on open access (SD 2.16), and g) I know
which version of my paper to upload in ÅAU:s research repository Artur (1.98). The
smallest variability was found in items f) I am aware of the ÅAU open science policy
(SD 1.86), d) I feel confident that I could explain open access to a colleague if asked
(SD 1.65), and a) I am familiar with the term ‘open access’ (SD 1.14). The responses
for statements b) about the difference between gold and green OA, and g) about Artur,
suggest that despite being familiar with OA issues, it is not easy to understand the
differences between different routes to OA.
Next, the reported self-awareness and knowledge was compared across different
respondent groups. The professors and postdoctoral researchers more strongly agreed
than doctoral students and university lecturers on the following statements; a) I am
familiar with the term ‘open access’, b) I am familiar with the difference between gold
and green OA, d) I feel confident I could explain OA to a colleague if asked, g) I know
74

Malin Fredriksson 2020

which version of my paper to ÅAU:s research repository Artur, I know how to find
relevant OA publications in which to publish my research.
Professors, postdoctoral researchers and university teachers more strongly agreed on
statement e) I am aware of the Academy of Finland mandate on OA to publicly funded
research, f) I am aware of the ÅAU open science policy. All in all, it can be argued that
respondents who had more extensive academic careers reported a higher level of
awareness and knowledge of OA issues. In addition, these respondents also showed a
higher degree of knowledge of OA policies (Academy of Finland and the ÅAU open
science policy).

5.4.

Perceptions of OA publishing

5.4.1. The perceived benefit of OA publishing
In Q2, the researchers’ perceptions of OA publishing are examined. This part of the
survey consists of different statements related to the benefits and tenets of OA, and
respondents were asked to report to which degree the agreed or disagreed to the
following statements:

f) There are no benefits to open access publishing
g) Researchers should retain the rights to their published work and allow it
to be used by others
h) Open access journals are of the same quality as subscription journals
i) Open access articles are cited more often than those in subscription
journals
76

Malin Fredriksson 2020

The respondents most strongly agreed with statement b) Publicly funded research
should be made available to the public (92 % slightly agree, agree or strongly agree).
The item second most strongly agreed on, was g) Researchers should retain the rights
to their published work and allow it to be used by others (73 %). The third most agreed
on item was h) Open access journals are of the same quality as subscription journals
(55 %).
Notably, items e) Open access publishing is more cost-effective than subscription-based
publishing, and i) Open access articles are cited more often than those in subscription
journals received a large proportion of responses (53 and 54 % respectively) for the
option “Neither disagree nor agree”. This tendency can be regarded as indicative of the
complexity of the situation: it is difficult for the respondents to take a stand in these
questions. At the same time, 58 % of the respondents slightly disagree, disagree or
strongly disagree with statement c) The current scholarly publishing model works well.
The SD (1.51) was highest for the item h) Open access journals are of the same quality
as subscription journals.
90 % strongly disagreed, disagreed or slightly disagreed on f) There are no benefits to
OA publishing. The majority strongly disagreed, disagreed or slightly disagreed on
statement a) OA publishing leads to an increase in research of poor quality (76 %) and
d) OA journals lack peer review (78 %).
Some similarities and differences could be observed as respondent groups were
compared. For a) Open access leads to an increase in research of poor quality, the Md
in all respondent groups was 2.0. Professors and university teachers agreed more
strongly (Md 7.0) on the statement b) Publicly funded research should be made
available to the public without barriers than postdoctoral researchers and doctoral
students (Md 6.0). In contrast, doctoral students agreed more strongly (Md 4.0) on c)
The current scholarly publishing model works well compared to the remaining
respondent groups (Md 2.0 in all). Professors indicated stronger disagreement (Md 1.5)
than other respondent groups (Md 2.0) for d) OA journals lack peer review. Post
doctoral researchers more strongly agreed (Md 6.0) on e) OA publishing is more costeffective than subscription-based publishing than other respondent groups (Md 4.0). In
all respondent groups, there was strong disagreement on the statement f) There are no
benefits to OA publishing (Md 1.0) (except Other, Md 2.0). Similarly, all respondent
77

Malin Fredriksson 2020

groups, except Other, indicated strong agreement (Md 6.0) on g) Researchers should
retain the rights to their published work and allow it to be used by others. Postdoctoral
researchers and university teachers agreed more strongly (Md 5.0) on h) OA journals
are of the same quality as subscription journals than professors (Md 4.5) and doctoral
students (Md 4.00).

5.4.2. Perceptions of OA’s role in disseminating knowledge in the researchers’
own field of research
In Q8, the items consider perceptions of how OA increases the visibility and
dissemination of knowledge, and the relevance of OA in the respondents’ own field of
research.

In this section, the respondents agreed most strongly on the statements e) It is important
to me that other researchers can access and read my research (SD 0.96), f) It is
important to me that practitioners in various fields in society can access and read my
research (SD 0.96), and g) It is important to me that the general public can access and
read my research (SD 1.00). Compared to the other items in this section of questions,
the SD was lowest for the above-mentioned items.
The highest SD are shown in c) Important researchers in my field are publishing open
access (SD 1.61), a) I would like to publish in open access publications (1.52), and h)
There are open access publications that match with my research interests/field (1.41).
Both similarities and differences could be observed across respondent groups. All
respondent groups slightly agreed (Md 5.0), except professors who agreed (Md 6.0) that
they a) Prefer to publish in OA journal. The SD was largest for postdoctoral researchers
(SD 1.77). All respondent groups agreed (Md 6.0) on statement b) I would like to
publish in OA journals/books in the future. Professors mostly agreed on (Md 5.5) the
statement c) Important researchers in my field are publishing OA, while doctoral
students neither disagreed nor agreed (Md 4.0). Postdoctoral researchers most strongly
agreed on (Md 7.0) d) Publishing OA would increase the visibility of my work, while the

82

Malin Fredriksson 2020

e) Impact factors will continue to be the primary metric in assessing the
value of journals
f) The COVID-19 epidemic has increased the importance of open access
As the collection of data coincided with the COVID-19 crisis in spring 2020, statement
f) “The COVID-19 epidemic has increased the importance of open access” was included
in the survey. The majority of the respondents to some extent agreed on the statement.
This statement also received the largest share of “strongly agree” responses in this
section of questions in total, but also the SD was the highest (1.55).
The majority to some extent agreed on the statement c) Most research will be published
open access, while the statement a) Subscription-based academic publications (which
the reader/university library pays access to) will remain the primary research outlet for
scholarly publishing received the largest share of responses of all items on the disagreeside of the scale. The SD for item a (1.36) was the second highest in this survey section.
The share of “neither disagree nor agree” responses were large for some items in this
survey section, and especially in items d) An alternative metric system will become
more important than impact factors in assessing the value of research, and e) Impact
factors will continue to be the primary metric in assessing the value of journals.
Both similarities and differences were observed across respondent groups. All
respondent groups neither disagreed nor agreed (Md 4.0) that a) Subscription-based
academic publications (which the reader/university library pays access to) will remain
the primary research outlet for scholarly publishing. The variability was largest among
postdoctoral researchers (SD 1.67) and professors (SD 1.64). Professors and university
teachers slightly agreed (Md 5.0) that b) A new kind of publication outlet
accommodating new types of research will become dominant over academic journals,
while doctoral student neither disagreed nor agreed (Md 4.0), and postdoctoral
researchers slightly disagreed (Md 3.0). Professors and postdoctoral researchers agree
(Md 6.0) that c) Most research will be published OA, while university teachers and
doctoral students slightly agree (Md 5.0). Likewise, professors and postdoctoral
researchers slightly agree (Md 5.0) that d) An alternative metric system will become
more important than impact factors in assessing the value of research, while
postdoctoral researchers and doctoral students neither disagree nor agree (Md 4.0).
Postdoctoral researchers agree (Md 6.0) that e) Impact factors will continue to be the
83

Malin Fredriksson 2020

primary metric in assessing the value of journals, while the remaining respondent
groups (Other excluded) neither disagree nor agree (Md 4.0). All respondent groups
(except professors Md 6.0) agree that f) the COVID-19 epidemic has increased the
importance of OA. The variability for f) was largest among professors (SD 1.74).
5.4.5. The relevance of publication attributes
In Q7, respondents were asked to assess the relevance (on the scale extremely irrelevant

b) Positive experience with the publisher/editor
c) Relevance of the publication for my field
d) Impact factor
e) Copyright policy
f) Recommendation of the publication by colleagues
g) Prestige/perceived quality of the publication
h) The publication is open access
i) Importance of the publication for academic promotion, tenure, or
assessment
j) Absence of publication fees
k) Policy which allows me to parallel publish my publication
l) Ranking in Publication Forum
All 59 respondents slightly agreed, agreed or strongly agreed on item c) Relevance of
the publication for my field. The second largest proportion of slightly agree, agree or
strongly agree responses were for g) Prestige/perceived quality of the publication, while
item f) Recommendation of the publication by colleagues was on third place. Also j)
Absence of publication fees was considered relevant or highly relevant.
Items related to the OA status (items h, k and e) were not reported as highly relevant
when choosing venue for publishing. In addition, the items related to the OA status of
the publication were among those items which received the largest proportions of
responses in the “Neither disagree nor agree” category.
The highest rate (28.81 %) of “Neither disagree nor agree” responses was for item e
(copyright policy), followed by 23.73 % for k (policy which provides opportunity for
parallel publishing) and 22.03 % for h (the publication is open access). Item i (ranking
in Publication Forum) also received a considerable proportion of the responses in the
same category (25.42 %).
Among the items which received the largest share of disagree-responses were: d) impact
factor, h) the publication is open access, e) copyright policy.
It should be observed that the differences in the responses between some of the items
can be considered minor. The SD was smallest in c) relevance of the publication for my
field (0.59), b) positive experience with the publisher/editor (0.91), f) recommendation
85

Malin Fredriksson 2020

of the publication by colleagues (1.12). The SD was largest in h) the publication is item
e) copyright policy (1.62) and i) importance of the publication for academic promotion
(1.62), d) impact factor (1.57), and h) the publication is open access (1.44).
The unimportance of the OA status of the publication channels can be seen as
contradictory to the results in Q8, where items a) and b) were used to measure the
respondents’ willingness to publish OA in the future.
In addition, there were variations in the perceptions of the importance of the publication
attributes among different respondent groups. Item h) the publication is open access
was slightly more important (Md 5.50) for professors than for other respondent groups
(Md 5.0). For professors (Md 6.0) it was more important than for postdoctoral
researchers and university teachers (Md 5.0) and doctoral students (Md 4.0) that the
journal has a k) policy which allows parallel publishing. For professors, postdoctoral
researchers and university teachers (Md 6.0), l) ranking in Publication Forum was more
important than for doctoral students (Md 5.0). Item g) prestige/perceived quality of the
publication was considered extremely important for university teachers (Md 7.0),
followed by professors and postdoctoral researchers (Md 6.0) and least important for
doctoral students (Md 5.50). Item c) Relevance of the publication for my field was
considered extremely important in all respondent groups (Md 7.0 in all). Similarly, a)
Speed of publication was considered relevant (Md 5.0) in all respondent groups. For
professors, university lecturers and postdoctoral researchers, b) positive experience with
the publisher/editor was considered more important (Md 6.0) than among doctoral
students (Md 5.0). For postdoctoral researchers and university teachers, l) importance of
the publication for academic promotion, tenure, or assessment was more important (Md
6.0) than for professors and doctoral students (Md 5.0). For university teachers, absence
of publication fees was extremely important (Md 7.0), while relevant for professors and
doctoral students (Md 6.0).

Facilitators and barriers for OA publishing and making research
openly available

In Q12 and Q13, the respondents were asked to rank the facilitators and barriers to OA
publishing on the scale most important (1) to least important (5). The respondents were
86

Malin Fredriksson 2020

asked to rank both factors that they perceived would make them make their research
more openly available, as well as which factors keep them from publishing open access.
In Q12, the respondents were asked to rank the factors which potentially would make
their research more openly available.
Q 12. Which factors would make your research more openly available? Please rank
according to the scale most important (1) to least important (5).
Figure 16. FHPT researchers’ ranking of which factors would help making their
research more openly available.

a)
b)
c)
d)
e)

a) The OA journal is of high scientific quality in my field of research
b) The APC (article processing charge) is paid by my university or
funder
c) More education about how open access works and which channel of
open access I should choose
d) High citation rates and ranking
e) More assistance, support and service from Åbo Akademi University
Library
The statement “The OA journal is of high scientific quality in my field of research” was
ranked by 30 respondents as the most important facilitator for making one’s research
more openly available. The statement “the APC is paid by my university or funder” was
87

Malin Fredriksson 2020

considered the most important factor by 13 respondents. In contrast 9, respondents
regarded “More education about how OA works” the most important. Three
respondents ranked “Higher citation rates and ranking” and “More assistance, support
and service from the ÅAUL library” the most important factor. “High citation rates and
ranking” was ranked as the least important factor that would make researchers make
their research more openly available.
In Q13, respondents were asked to rank the factors which keep them from publishing
OA or making publications openly available. The items were the following (randomized
order):
Q 13. Which factors keep you from publishing open access or making your
publications openly available? Please rank according to the scale most important (1)
to least important (5).

d) I am not sure that publishing OA will give more visibility and impact for
my research
88

Malin Fredriksson 2020

e) I do not get enough assistance, support and service from Åbo Akademi
University Library
The statement “I cannot pay for the APCs” was reported as the most important barrier
by 28 respondents, while “I do not have time to search information for how to publish
open access” was reported as the most important factor by 14 respondents. The
statement “I think the open access journals in my field are not of good quality” was
perceived as the most important barrier by 13 respondents. The statements “I am not
sure that publishing OA will give more visibility and impact for my research” and “I do
not get enough assistance, support and service from Åbo Akademi University Library”
received two responses each.
When it comes to the factors which were regarded as the least important factors
(smallest barriers), “I do not get enough assistance, support and service from Åbo
Akademi University Library” received 18 responses and “I think the open access
journals in my field are not of good quality” received 17.
As the question used a forced ranking scale, some answer options may have been
inapplicable for some respondents. Consequently, it can be assumed that the results
reflect not only actual situations of the respondents, but also how they would act in
potential situations. For example, early-career researchers have necessarily not
experienced such situations yet.

Qualitative content analysis of responses in open-ended questions

A qualitative content analysis was conducted for the responses in the open-ended
questions in the survey. In the end of the survey, there were two optional open-ended
questions:
Q21: What do you do when you have questions or encounter problems? For
example, where do you seek for information? Whom do you contact?
Q22: Any comments on open access
Q21 received 25 responses, while Q22 received 21. As one response may mention more
than one specific topic, the total number of topics is larger than the number of
responses. The topics occurring in the responses were coded in the following categories,
which were based on the themes and structure of the survey:
89

Malin Fredriksson 2020

-

economic aspects of OA publishing, funding models

-

prestige and quality of publications

-

lack of OA journals in research field

-

OA and academic career

-

institutional support

In some quotes, language errors have been corrected to improve the readability of the
text. The coding scheme for responses in Q21 and Q22 will be made openly available in
FSSD.
The economic aspects of OA publishing
The economic aspects of the system of scholarly publishing overall and the transition
from subscription-based to OA is mentioned in the responses as criticism against large
profit-making publishers, research funders’ financial support for OA, and the question
of APCs. As one experienced researcher argues, the basic problem, the profit-making of
large publishers, should be more emphasized in today’s debate on OA publishing:
In my view, the entire discussion on open access is thoroughly confused in
several important respects. We might not even be having the discussion at
all, were it not for the fact that journal subscription fees have risen to such
high levels. The issue has absolutely everything to do with the profit
motive of the large academic publishing houses. Consequently, that is also
where solutions to the problem has to be sought.
The same respondent continues with explaining experiences of the problem of large
publishing houses which can benefit from public economic resources several times
(double-dipping), especially when the issue of paying APCs is involved:
I refuse to have the Finnish taxpayer first pay for my research, then pay
again for its publication, and then once again in the form of a journal
subscription fee. Which is worse? Not publishing open access or using
public funds to pay for it three times over? And so, again, although it is
clearly the greed of the large publishing houses that is the problem, this
particular aspect only plays a small part in discussion on open access.
Expensive APCs is a concern also for another respondent:
I think OA is an excellent idea. It will take time to develop it further: right
now, there are issues e.g. with unreasonably high author processing costs
90

Malin Fredriksson 2020

for some well-esteemed OA journals (to my mind anything, say, over 1
000 euros for an online-only journal article is too much given the digital
systems currently available).
At the same time, structural support in the form of research funders’ inclusion of open
access costs is necessary for making individual researchers publish open access:
I think it’s excellent that some funding bodies (e.g. European Research
Council) include open access costs in their research funding. Without
that, it has seemed financially impossible for an individual researcher to
deal with the publisher's open access fees.
Prestige and quality of OA journals – and lack of OA journals overall
Issues concerning prestige, ranking and quality of OA journals, as well as the lack of
journals in the researcher’s field of study overall, were mentioned in the predominant
part of the responses. The lack of OA journals overall, and in particular prestigious
journals in the research field is, according to one respondent, the main problem:
Most of the high-level journals in my field are not open access and that
means that my publications will not be either. There is not really any way
around this problem, if I want to keep publishing my research.
In similar vein, another researcher explains that although s/he supports the idea of OA,
living up to those ideals is more difficult in practice:
I strongly support open access publishing in theory, but in practice I must
find publishers who are interested in publishing my work. There are very
few true open access options in my exact field of study.
As another respondent continues, traditional subscription-based journals have developed
their prestige over a long time, and prestige has little to do with OA as such:
The fact that the most prestigious journals within my field are still not OA
is, I believe, largely due to historical reasons: they are prestigious because
they were established long ago and have had a long time to build their
reputation. So, the level of prestige has little to do with OA as such. In the
long run, I believe OA is a much more sustainable form of publication, at
least if non-OA journals continue to charge high subscription fees etc.

91

Malin Fredriksson 2020

At the same time as the transition towards OA publishing should not be in the hands of
individual researchers, the development towards increasing the proportion of OA
publishing emerge from the research field itself:
I think it is very important, but it also feels that the decisions are not up to
individual researchers. If the OA publications would rank higher and be
free of charge, then I think more researchers would consider publishing in
them.
As publishing monographs is a central characteristic to research in humanities, it should
be noted that most current OA policies (such as Plan S) do not apply for monographs:
High-ranking research in the humanities is often published in monograph
form by commercial publishing houses. This somewhat limits the
applicability of OA policies.

Academic career and OA publishing
Several aspects of choosing OA publication channels as venues for publishing in
different phases of one’s academic career is mentioned by several respondents. As a
doctoral student explains: does a doctoral student need to choose between building an
academic career by publishing in conventional journals or preferring OA publications:
I think a major problem is that there aren’t that many viable journal
options for open access in some fields. There are ca two relevant open
access journals in my field – and they are very low ranked. Not that it
matters that much as a doctoral student, but still.
In similar vein, another doctoral student explains that more experienced researchers are
in the position to make a change towards increased OA:
… It would be important that the leading scholars in our fields, who are
already established both academically and financially, would be pioneers
and start to clearly prioritize OA publishing, that would make it easier for
junior scholars to follow along.
The issue is viewed also from the perspective of a professor:
Experienced and established researchers do not choose publication
channels on the basis of whether they are open access or not. They have
92

Malin Fredriksson 2020

not done so thus far and probably never will, unless that becomes some
kind of absolute requirement. They choose them on the basis of how wellestablished they are, and how good of a forum they provide for the
dissemination of one’s research. For example, the most prominent (and
still most widely read) journals tend not to be open access, although they
usually provide the hybrid option. Researchers are therefore unlikely to
start publishing in open access journals until these journals become
recognized and established enough (and most of them are not).
These responses can be considered implications of how views on OA partly is a
generational issue in academia.
Institutional support
Structural and institutional support is considered as one of the cornerstones of the
success of the transition towards OA. For example, the role of the university library is
emphasized:
It would be nice to know more about OA and its opportunities. If open
access is so important as it is told all the time, then please – tell us more!
Maybe the library or some other directions with expertise concerning the
field should be even more active.
Although parallel publishing is viable OA for many research funders, this is not the case
in practice for individual researchers:
The option of parallel publishing (Artur) does not feel like open access to
me, since the preprint etc. versions are not citable.
The challenges in parallel publishing is also explained by another researcher:
The absolutely main problem with open access publishing and repository
publishing is that I find it very difficult to understand the different
copyright licenses, i.e. when is it OK to parallel publish my article in a
repository and in what format while avoiding getting sued by Taylor &
Francis.

Summary of main findings

In this section, the main findings of both sub-studies are summarized.
Sub-study I
In sub-study I, the patterns of scholarly publishing were examined both at ÅAU as a
whole (all fields of science), and the patterns in humanities in particular. The method
applied was a quantitative analysis of bibliographic data of peer reviewed publications
(both articles and monographs, types A and C according to the definitions of MEC)
published in 2018 by researchers affiliated to ÅAU. The choice of areas for data
analysis were based primarily on Ilva’s (2017, 2018, 2019) studies on the proportions of
OA publications of reported publications. An analysis of publication data provides
insights into the actual patterns of scholarly publishing in a defined timeframe, and
therefore assessed as an appropriate method to examine and assess the recent patterns of
scholarly publishing. The publication data was retrieved in spring 2020 through the
Juuli user interface of the national publication database Virta.
To map the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities at ÅAU, the shares of
different publication types, their OA status, and Publication Forum classification were
analyzed. The publication data of other fields of science (social sciences, natural
sciences, natural sciences, medical and health sciences, and engineering and
technology) were also retrieved in order to contextualize the present study’s focus on
publishing in humanities. This comparison with other fields of science makes it possible
to identify those patterns of scholarly publishing which are characteristic to the
humanities. The main findings are summarized below following the order of Figure 3–
9, presented in the previous chapter.
 To map the disciplinary context of scholarly publishing at ÅAU, all scientific
publications (types A and C) in all fields of science were retrieved. The third largest
number of publications in categories A and C in total were produced in humanities,
after natural sciences and social sciences. It should be observed that the number of
publications is classified according to discipline/field of science (Statistics Finland
2010), and not the division of faculties at the university.
94

Malin Fredriksson 2020

 To map the characteristic publication types and sub-types in different fields of
science, the publication data for all fields of science was retrieved. In humanities, the
share of publications in A1 (refereed journal articles) is smallest compared to other
fields of science, although it still is the predominant outlet for research. In contrast to
other fields of science, the shares of publications in publication types A3 (book
chapters or chapters in research books), C1 (book) and C2 (edited works) are
significantly larger in humanities. Thus, the publication types A3, C1, and C2
emerge as characteristic to the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities at
ÅAU. These largely corresponds to patterns of scholarly publishing identified in
humanities both in the contexts of international and national scholarly publishing.
 In addition to mapping the characteristic patterns in humanities, it is equally
important to identify the characteristics of routes to OA. To map the characteristics
of OA publishing across disciplines, the OA status of publications in type A were
retrieved for publications in all fields of science. The share of publications in full OA
channels for journal articles (A) was the second largest in humanities after medical
and health sciences, while the smallest share of full OA publications was found in
engineering and technology. The additional value of parallel publishing in
humanities was at a decent level. Compared to other fields of science, the parallel
publishing situation of humanities was located between the lowest (in medical and
health sciences) and highest proportions (natural sciences) of parallel publishing in
other fields of science. The share of publications in the category Other OA (typically
articles in hybrid journals) was the smallest in humanities and largest in medical and
health sciences. Notably, it appeared that some publications in the category Other
OA, at least in the humanities, were not articles in hybrid journals, but delayed OA.
The largest share of closed access publications was found in engineering and
technology and the smallest share in medical and health sciences, while humanities
was located in-between the two extremes.
 To further investigate the characteristics of routes to OA as part of the patterns of
scholarly publishing in humanities, the OA status among publications in both
publication type A1–A4 and C1–C2 in humanities was examined. In humanities, the
largest share of closed access channels was found in monograph publications (A3,
C1 and C2).

95

Malin Fredriksson 2020

 The Publication Forum classification of publications is considered one measurement
of scientific quality (Publication Forum 2020). First, the distribution of publications
at different levels in Publication Forum was examined in each field of science
individually. The largest share of publications at level 3 was found in social sciences,
while the smallest in natural sciences. A slightly larger amount was found in
humanities. In contrast, the largest share of publications at level 1 was found in
humanities and engineering and technology, while the smallest in medical and health
sciences. The smallest share of publications at level 2 was found in engineering and
technology, and the largest in medical and health sciences. There are clearly
differences in the shares of publications at different Publication Forum levels in
different fields of science, but the differences are not significant. The distribution in
humanities largely corresponds to the situation in natural sciences, engineering and
technology, and social sciences. The most remarkable difference is in medical and
health sciences, in which the share of publications in Publication Forum class 1 is
clearly smaller than in the rest, from which follows that the shares at level 2 and 3
are smaller.
 To map the routes to OA in publications in different Publication Forum classes in all
fields of science, all publications in A in all fields of science were retrieved together.
The OA status of publications in each Publication Forum class was checked
separately. The largest share of full OA publications was at Publication Forum level
1. The share of full OA publications at both Jufo 2 and 3 was half of the share at
level 1. The additional value of parallel publishing was clearly the largest at Jufo 3.
In total, the share of publications which were available as OA (regardless of route to
OA) was largest at level 1. The share of closed access publications was largest at
level 2.
 Finally, the routes to OA at different Jufo levels in humanities was examined. The
share of full gold OA publications in humanities at level 1 was larger than the total
share in all fields of science. The share of full OA at Jufo 2 in humanities was also
larger than the share when all fields of science are counted together (15 %).
A notable difference is, however, that there were no full OA publications at
Publication Forum level 3 in humanities. Altogether, the share of green OA+ is
smaller in humanities compared to all field of science taken together. The share of

96

Malin Fredriksson 2020

not OA at Publication Forum level 3 was considerably larger in humanities compared
to all fields of science together.
Sub-study II
In total 59 respondents, researchers affiliated to FHPT, participated in the survey which
intended to map the awareness, knowledge, perceptions and experiences of researchers
in humanities at ÅAU. About half of the respondents were doctoral students, while the
rest of the respondents were distributed in the remaining categories of researchers. The
typical (most frequent) respondent in the survey was a female doctoral student.


Awareness and knowledge of OA: Overall, the respondents reported a high level of
awareness and knowledge of the different aspects of OA. There were, however,
differences between researchers at different stages in their careers. More
experienced researchers agreed on the question items to a larger extent than
doctoral students, and thus indicated a higher level of awareness and knowledge.
The difference to doctoral students was more distinct for question items which
concerned for example the ÅAU open science policy and Academy of Finland’s
mandate on OA to research publications. When it comes to green OA the level of
reported awareness and knowledge was lower than for most other question items.
Among all respondents there was most disagreement concerning understanding the
difference between gold and green OA, and which version of the paper to parallel
publish.



Experience of OA publishing: Senior researchers (professors, university teachers,
postdoctoral researchers) reported to have more experience of publishing in gold
OA journals, hybrid journals, and parallel publishing. In addition, senior researcher
had participated in OA education provided by the library more extensively than
doctoral students. A larger share of respondents who had participated in OA
education had also published in gold OA journals, hybrid journals, or parallel
published, compared to those who had not participated in OA education.



Perceptions of OA publishing: Similarly, the overall perceptions of OA among
researchers was remarkably positive (respondents strongly agreed on the
statements), but for some of the question items, senior researchers tended to agree
more extensively than doctoral students. With regards to publication attributes, the
97

Malin Fredriksson 2020

respondents reported that the most important factors when deciding where to
publish their research were the relevance of the publication in the current field of
research, and the perceived prestige or quality of the journal, and the absence of
publication fees. Among the least important factors when deciding the venue for
publishing were the publication’s impact factor, parallel publishing policy, OA
status of the publication, and copyright policy. The OA attributes of a publication
was considered more relevant among senior researchers (professors in particular)
compared to doctoral students.


Facilitators and barriers to OA publishing: In Q12, the respondents were asked to
rank the factors which would make their research more openly available. The
statement “the OA journal is of high scientific value in my field of research” was
considered the most important factor, while “the APC is paid by my university or
funder” and “more education about OA” were ranked on second and third place.
“High citation rates or ranking” and “more support and service from Åbo Akademi
University Library” were ranked at the end of the list. Although it should be noted
that the differences between some of the items can be considered minor, the results
suggest that the most important factor comes from the research field itself: OA
journals need to have high scientific value in the research field.

The responses in the open-ended questions are in line with and supported the results of
the quantitative publication data analysis and the quantitative results of the survey. For
example, the notion that OA attributes of the publication are not the most important
ones when deciding venues for publishing was emphasized also in some of the
responses in the open-ended questions of the survey.

6. Discussion
This section discusses the results in relation to previous research, the empirical
contribution of the study, implications and recommendations for practice, and provides
suggestions for future research. In the concluding remarks, the results are assessed
towards the future of OA.

6.1.

Discussion of results in relation to previous research

Scholarly publishing is one of the core activities in academia. The aim of this study was
to examine a profound change, which takes place in formal scholarly communication
and scholarly publishing today, namely the transition from closed access publishing to
OA publishing. Overall, the transition towards OA has been slow and has been going on
for at least three decades, since the emergence of the Internet (Holopainen & Koskinen
2016, Laakso et al 2011). Previous studies suggest that the transition towards OA in
humanities has been especially slow compared to other disciplines, both with regards to
the amount of OA publications (both journals and monographs) (e.g. Archambault et al
2014, Eve 2014, Puuska 2014, Williams et al 2009), and the transformation of attitudes
and motivations within the research community (e.g. Coonin & Younce 2010, Gaines
2015, Gross & Ryan 2015).
The present study examines the ongoing transition towards OA publishing in
humanities, with a focus on the patterns of scholarly publishing, and the views on and
experiences of OA publishing among researchers in humanities. The humanities at
ÅAU serves as a case study. As the present case study does not provide a basis for
systematic comparison to other disciplines at ÅAU, and does not examine change over
time, the case study firsthand provides a window into the current situation in humanities
with regards to the transition towards OA publishing. The results concerning the FHPT
researchers’ awareness, knowledge, perceptions and experiences of OA publishing are
therefore compared to observations of more general nature in previous studies.
The main research question is formulated as follows: How is the transition from closed
access publishing to OA publishing in humanities expressed in publishing patterns, and
perceived and experienced from the perspective of researchers?
99

Malin Fredriksson 2020

The main research question is further divided into sub-questions. First, the transition
towards OA publishing in humanities is examined with regards to publishing patterns.
1) Which patterns of scholarly publishing are typical to humanities and
how is OA part of those patterns?
While the peer reviewed article remains the main research outlet also in humanities,
scholarly publishing in humanities is characterized by publishing in monographs more
extensively than in other disciplines (Puuska 2014). While the development of OA
journal publishing models has been the main focus in international and national OA
initiatives, the transition towards OA monograph publishing has been slower. The
challenges in finding sustainable models for OA monograph publishing can be
considered one of the main structural reasons why the transition towards OA has
occurred more slowly in humanities than in other disciplines (Eve 2014, Williams et al
2009).The need for separate solutions for OA monograph publishing has been observed
also in Plan S (2018).
When examining the patterns of scholarly publishing, the national and institutional
contexts demand attention. In Finland, the core funding of universities is based on
reported publications which are collected in the annual national publication collection
by the MEC. In other words, the publishing activities of affiliated researchers have a
direct impact on the university’s funding. From the perspective of institutions in higher
education, this is a main incentive to accurately and extensively report the publications
produced by their staff. The publication data, collected in the annual publication
collection, can be used for analyzing trends and patterns of scholarly publishing in
Finnish institutions in higher education (Ilva 2017, 2019).
a) How large is the share of peer reviewed OA publications produced in
humanities, compared to other disciplines (fields of science)?
To map the patterns of scholarly publishing in an organizational context, the publication
activities in all disciplines and in humanities in particular at ÅAU were examined in
sub-study I. The results of sub-study 1 are in line with publishing patterns identified in
both internal and national contexts. The comparison between scholarly publishing
patterns in humanities and other disciplines serves the purpose to contextualize the
100

Malin Fredriksson 2020

study in those patterns of scholarly publishing identified internationally (Eve 2014) and
nationally (Puuska 2014). In sub-study I, it was found that monographs are almost
exclusively published in the humanities (and social sciences).
The current situation of OA publishing at ÅAU needs to be viewed from a national
perspective, although direct generalizations and comparisons should not be made. A
rapid development towards increased OA publishing can be clearly distinguished in
Finnish universities in the past years (Ilva 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020a, 2020b). Since
2015, the proportions of OA publishing (full OA, hybrid, green OA) have increased
significantly in all fields of science in five years (Ilva 2020a).
The current development, observed by Ilva during subsequent years (2017, 2018, 2019)
is that the total share of OA (full OA, hybrid, green OA) of the peer reviewed journal
publications in humanities can altogether be considered being at a decent level when
compared to other fields of science. The same observation can be made regarding the
situation of scholarly publishing at ÅAU.
b) Which routes to OA and other publication characteristics are typical to
publications in humanities, compared to other disciplines (fields of science)?
The proportions of different routes to OA vary across disciplines. In sub-study I, the
share of publications in full OA channels for journal articles (A) was the second largest
in humanities after medical and health sciences, while the smallest share of full OA
publications was found in engineering and technology. The additional value of parallel
publishing in humanities was at a decent level. Compared to other fields of science, the
situation of parallel publishing in humanities was located between the lowest (in
medical and health sciences) and highest proportions (natural sciences) of parallel
publishing in other fields of science. The share of publications in the category Other OA
(typically articles in hybrid journals) was the smallest in humanities and largest in
medical and health sciences. These observations largely correspond to those of Ilva
(2017, 2019).
The classification in Publication Forum emerges as another central publication
characteristic. Ilva (2017, 2018, 2019) further observes that the distribution of different
routes to OA (gold, green, hybrid) varies at different levels in the Publication Forum
101

Malin Fredriksson 2020

classification system. As observed by Ilva (2017, 2018, 2019), the proportions of hybrid
OA and parallel publishing increase at level 2 and 3, while the proportion of full OA is
typically larger at level 1. The same pattern was observed in the present case study.
Sub-study I also shows that the additional benefit of green OA was smaller in A3 and
C1 (typical publication types in humanities) compared to other publication types, which
corresponds to previous observations (Ilva 2017).
As Ilva (2020a, 2020b) also observes in his latest overview, the share of OA
publications of the total of reported scholarly publications has been growing remarkably
rapidly in Finnish institutions of higher education in only a few years. According to the
preliminary numbers of the national publication collection in 2019 conducted by the
MEC, about 65 % of all peer reviewed articles (A) produced at Finnish universities
were reported to be available in some form of OA. In 2018, the equivalent number was
slightly more than 50 % in all Finnish universities together (Ilva 2019).
When the relatively short timeframe of implementing OA policies and the inclusion of
OA status in the national publication collection is considered, the development has been
notably rapid during a short time: from less than 30 % of OA (in A1–A4 as displayed
below) to preliminarily 65 % in 2019 (Ilva 2020).

While the publishing patterns examined in sub-study I reflect the outcome of
researchers’ actual publishing choices, sub-study II focuses on researchers’ views on
and experiences of OA publishing. Together, these provide a comprehensive insight into
the transition towards OA in an organizational context.
Previous studies indicate that the development in humanities, both in the research
community (Coonin & Younce 2010, Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015) and among
102

Malin Fredriksson 2020

publishers (Eve 2014, Williams et al 2009) in that field, has been slow compared to
other disciplines with regard to embracing OA publishing. Therefore, the case study
continued with a survey which was distributed among FHPT researchers (N=59). The
survey results were used to respond to the following research questions:
2) What is the level of awareness and knowledge of OA publishing among
researchers in the humanities, and how do they perceive of OA publishing?
Previous studies (Coonin & Younce 2010, Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015, Rowley et
al 2017), which examine awareness, knowledge, perceptions and experiences of OA
publishing among researchers, indicate that there are disciplinary differences. In
general, it is assumed that the adoption of OA in individual publishing patterns has been
slower in humanities.
Since the present study has been conducted only once at ÅAU, conclusions about
comparisons to other faculties, disciplines, and change over time, cannot be made.
Overall, it can still be concluded that the respondents report a rather high level of
awareness and knowledge of OA issues, and quite strongly agree on the principles of
OA. Especially in comparison with older studies on researchers’ awareness, knowledge,
perceptions and experiences of OA publishing (Coonin & Younce 2010, Gaines 2015,
Gross & Ryan 2015, Rowley et al 2017), the results of the present study seem to
indicate a higher level of awareness, knowledge and a stronger agreement on the
principles of OA.
a) To what extent do researchers report awareness and knowledge of
different forms of OA publishing?
In the beginning of the survey, respondents were asked to assess their awareness and
knowledge of OA issues, such as the difference between gold and green OA, the ÅAU
open science policy, the Academy of Finland mandate on OA to research results. The
question items concerning knowledge about the difference between gold and green OA
and which version to parallel publish, showed that researchers were unsure about the
differences. This is one example of tendency which corresponds with previous findings
(e.g. Kim 2011) which, amongst others, suggest that researchers typically are unaware
of the opportunities of parallel publishing or do not see the benefits of it.
103

Malin Fredriksson 2020

In the present study, respondents in different academic positions (junior or senior
researcher), show differences in the level of self-reported awareness, knowledge, and
perceptions of OA issues, for example when it comes to awareness of policies (ÅAU
open science policy, Academy of Finland mandate on OA). Since the responses are
based on self-assessment, definite conclusions cannot be made about the level of
awareness and knowledge.
b) To what extent do researchers have experience of OA publishing?
In this research question, OA publishing includes all forms of OA (full gold OA, hybrid,
green OA). Sub-study I gives a preliminary insight into the experiences of OA
publishing among ÅAU researchers, at least among those who have published a peer
reviewed publication in 2018. In total 57 % of the journal articles produced in
humanities in 2018 were available via some form of OA (gold, green or hybrid), while
43 % were closed access.
In sub-study II as part of the survey, the participants reported their experiences of
publishing in gold OA publications, hybrid journals, and parallel publishing. More
experienced researchers reported more extensive experience than junior researchers for
all routes to OA. It should be observed that the present study does not distinguish
between those who have previous publishing experiences and those who have not
published anything at all.
c) What are researchers’ perceptions of OA publishing?
Overall, the respondents in the case study indicated a high level of agreement with the
principles of OA. The overall results of sub-study II are in line with previous studies
(e.g. Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015) which show that researchers are increasingly
interested in and are positive about OA publishing. For example, there was strong
disagreement on the statement about OA and predatory publishing, which suggest that
the association between OA publishing and predatory publishing can be regarded as a
myth.
The relevance of OA attributes in researchers’ selection of publishing channel has been
a central topic in previous studies. The perceived prestige and quality of the publication
104

Malin Fredriksson 2020

channel and the relevance to the field remain the most important factors for researchers.
In previous studies, amongst others Blankstein and Wolff-Eisenberg (2019), Coonin &
Younce (2010) and Gaines (2015) have observed that despite extensive agreement on
the tenets of OA, only few researchers perceive the OA attributes of publications as
highly relevant when choosing venue for publishing research. This observation
corresponds with the results of Q8 in the survey. In sub-study II, question items related
to the OA attributes of publications, such as the publication being an OA journal, policy
which allows parallel publishing, and copyright policy, were considered as slightly
irrelevant, irrelevant or extremely irrelevant by about one fifth of the respondents. In
contrast, other publication attributes, such as relevance to the research field, and
prestige and quality of the publication, received the largest proportion of responses as
extremely relevant and relevant. All respondents reported that they slightly agree, agree
or strongly agree on the statement that the relevance of journal to the field is important
when making the decision.
d) Which are the main factors that would support researchers in publishing
OA, and which are the main factors that hinder them from publishing OA?
The results of sub-study II further exemplify the complexity of OA publishing from the
perspective of the researchers, most importantly concerning the perceived quality and
prestige of publications. In Q12 and Q13, the quality of OA journals and financial
support for APCs emerged as the most critical factors in the transition towards
increasing the proportion of OA publishing in humanities. Facilitators and barriers with
regard to OA publishing were also frequently mentioned in the open-ended questions in
the survey, which further supported the results of the ranking scale question items.
High scientific quality of OA journals in the field of research was considered the most
important factor which would make research more openly available (Q12). This result is
also supported by the responses in the open-ended questions. Both senior researchers
and doctoral students mentioned that senior researcher are used to publishing in wellestablished journals which typically are not OA. This tendency is, by some doctoral
students, experienced as difficult: how to support OA in one’s own research and build a
career, if those OA publications are not considered prestigious enough?

105

Malin Fredriksson 2020

The questions of funding for APCs also emerge as a central issue: absence of APC fees
was perceived as one of the most important factors when selecting venues for
publishing. Funding for APCs was also seen as the second most important factor which
would facilitate researchers to publish OA. Similarly, lack of funding for APCs was
seen as the most central barrier to making research openly available. This observation
corresponds to, amongst others, Zhu (2017) who in their studies observed that APCs
constitute a main barrier for researchers to make their research OA. The question of
how to cover APC costs emerged as a central theme also in the open responses. A main
concern was the problem of double-dipping.
The results further indicate that services provided by the library, such as support and
services for parallel publishing, is central for supporting researchers in making their
research openly available, but the main opportunities and challenges of OA are related
to the publishing patterns in the specific field of research.

6.2.

Implications and recommendations for practice

The outcome of this case study is mainly an empirical contribution. The main empirical
contribution of this in-depth case study is that it provides new insights into publishing
patterns, views on and experiences of OA publishing among researchers in humanities
at ÅAU. The results cannot be statistically generalized, but it can be stated that the 59
respondents provide a rather broad insight into the current views and experiences of
researchers both in their early careers and those who have longer experience in
academia. The analysis of patterns of scholarly publishing shows that the situation of
publishing in full gold OA journals and parallel publishing can be considered to be at a
decent level when compared to other fields of science.
Based on the empirical findings and the assessment of the results in relation to previous
research, some implications and recommendations for practice can be drawn at
individual and institutional level, which are in dialogue with policy level.


Discussion on the question of prestige and quality of (OA) publications in the
discipline. Based on the results, it is motivated to assume that OA publishing is
not a means to itself, and other publication attributes than OA-related emerge as
more important. Publishing in gold OA journals is rapidly increasing, and
106

Malin Fredriksson 2020

researchers can be encouraged to publish in them, as long as they assess the
quality and prestige of the journal in their respective research fields.


Increase the motivation to parallel publish. This recommendation is based on the
results of the items in the survey, which indicate that the level of awareness and
knowledge of green OA is lower than for full gold OA. In addition, green OA
was by some respondents considered not a viable option of OA. The question of
parallel publishing is especially urgent with regards to book sections (A3),
monographs and edited works (C), since these publication types are
characteristic to the publishing landscape of humanities. A closer examination of
publishers’ copyright and OA policies was outside the scope of this thesis, but it
is not unusual that publishers provide some opportunities for parallel publishing
also of book chapters and even entire books.



Peer support in OA issues, for doctoral students in particular. This
recommendation is based on the insight in the survey that doctoral students
reported a lower degree of awareness and knowledge of OA than senior
scholars. In addition, respondents mentioned in the open-ended questions that
senior researchers are in a key role to make change. The role of the supervisor as
a senior researcher with more extensive publishing experience is central.



Researchers in humanities should be made aware of their opportunities to APC
deals and discounts. In the survey, absence of APC costs was one of the most
relevant attributes when deciding where to publish. At the same time, APCs
were considered one of the main barriers for making one’s research openly
available. As concluded also at a policy level (e.g., Plan S), the coverage of APC
costs is a central mechanism to support researchers in publishing OA. According
to Plan S, one of the aims is to eliminate the hybrid publishing model, which
benefits from both the subscription fees and APCs. In the transition phase
towards full OA, so called transformative agreements are, however, allowed.
Through the agreements between Finnish library consortium FinElib and
publishers, researchers affiliated to participating universities are eligible of APC
vouchers and discounts (to a limited extent). The hybrid publishing model was a
concern also among the responses in the open-ended question. From this
perspective, gold OA (as hybrid) is not an end in itself, in case it comes at a too
expensive cost. It should also be observed that researchers who are not affiliated
107

Malin Fredriksson 2020

cannot benefit from the deals and discounts, and are thus in an unequal position.
Therefore, researchers should also be reminded of the fact that parallel
publishing in general is a viable form of OA from the perspective of research
funders.
These implications and recommendations for practice are formulated from the
perspective of research institutions to support the individual researcher in making their
research OA. More importantly, the implementations resulting from national policies or
the policies of research funders are in the most critical position which affect the
development of OA. In this sense, the future of OA should not be in the hands of
individual researchers, but the main support emerges from structural and financial
frameworks.

6.3.

Limitations of the study

In this section, the limitations of the study are assessed and discussed. The limitations
are primarily connected to the reliability and the validity of both sub-studies, as well as
how they together shed light on the research topic. Reliability concerns
the consistency of a measure, while validity concerns the accuracy of a measure
(Creswell & Creswell 2018). The reliability and validity are assessed in both sub-studies
separately.
Reliability and validity in sub-study I
In sub-study I, the patterns of scholarly publishing in humanities in relation to other
fields of science have been examined by analyzing publication data. The OA status of
publications in different publication types have also been examined. The limitations
mainly concern the reliability and consistency of the publication data and the
consequences for the results. When using data, which other actors have collected for
other purposes, the reliability and validity of the obtained data is largely out of control
for the researcher (Creswell & Creswell 2018). Taking this into consideration is highly
relevant when assessing sub-study I, as the publication data has been collected as part of
the national publication collection conducted by the MEC.

108

Malin Fredriksson 2020

There are several factors concerning the publication data, which may affect the quality
and the correctness of the results, but are independent of the researcher. To guarantee
that the same definitions of OA have been deployed both when retrieving data and in
the presentation of results, the handbook, which was in effect in 2018 (Tiedonkeruun
käsikirja 2018), was used as a point of reference. More importantly, however, the
publication data itself available through Juuli may contain errors. Despite the thorough
validation processes conducted by the university libraries and the MEC, there is a
probability that the definitions of OA, and other publication characteristics, provided by
the MEC have not been consistently applied by the university libraries and individual
validators, as observed by Ilva 2017 and Ilva 2019. For example, delayed OA is not
considered proper OA according to the definitions of MEC (Tiedonkeruun käsikirja
2018), but publications which are delayed OA may still have been included as OA
publications in the validation process (Ilva 2019). Some examples of validated
publications, which contained mistakes in the publication data, were observed also
when conducting this study.
Since the total numbers of reported publications can be considered small, errors in the
publication data inevitably affect the results as presented in this thesis. As an additional
consequence of small quantities, these errors may rather decisively affect the results
presented as percentages. Manual corrections have not been made in the data retrieved
for the study, since this would negatively affect the consistency of the data and the
opportunities for comparison and replication of the study. Overall, the changeability of
the data available in Virta should be taken into account when planning comparisons of
different publication data or a replication of the study. The publication data in Virta is
constantly being updated, which makes it difficult to check the correctness of search
strategies and the exact number of publications after some time has passed (Ilva 2017,
2019). Therefore, the exact dates for retrieving the publication data have been
documented in the research process. There were changes in the publication data during
the research process. For instance, in the last procedures of data retrieval and checking
previously retrieved data, the situation for parallel publishing had improved in almost
all fields of science.
Despite the limitations of the publication data, the publication data in Virta represent the
official statistics of publications produced at institutions in higher education in Finland.
109

Malin Fredriksson 2020

In that sense, the use and interpretation of the publication data, despite the probability of
errors, is valid for assessing the OA status of publications and the patterns of scholarly
publishing at institutions of higher education.
Since the fields of science, which are used to describe the discipline of a publication, do
not necessarily correspond to the affiliation of the researcher, it is not appropriate to
draw direct conclusions on a faculty level. For the same reason, comparisons between
corresponding faculties at different universities is hardly motivated. It can, however, be
assumed that most publications reported in humanities at ÅAU have been produced at
FHPT.
With regards to validity, it should be observed that analysis of publication data of
research institutions needs to be understood in their organizational and disciplinary
context in order to be meaningful data for interpretation. In this study, an analysis of
publication data of all disciplines has been presented to contextualize the patterns of
scholarly publishing in humanities in particular. Since the analysis of publishing
patterns is limited to one year only, the results provided only a limited view into the
current state of scholarly publishing activities. The results cannot be seen as a tool for
predicting future publishing activities. Neither can the results be directly compared to
the publishing patterns internationally.
Reliability and validity in sub-study II
The limitations of sub-study II are discussed with regards to the design of the survey
(measurement consistency), data collection or sampling (response bias), data
processing, and the analysis of survey data. The reliability and validity of the results are
assessed.
The limitation concerning measurement reliability concerns the consistency of the
survey to measure what it is intended to measure (Creswell & Creswell 2018). To avoid
this kind of bias, a pilot survey was conducted to secure the consistency of the survey
items before its wider distribution. It should be acknowledged that the topic of OA can
be considered difficult, and far from all researchers are knowledgeable of OA issues.
Although most respondents reported a high level of awareness and knowledge of OA
issues, it cannot be excluded that respondents have interpreted the survey questions in
110

Malin Fredriksson 2020

other ways than the researcher have intended to. This means that confusion of
terminology and other misunderstandings would inevitably affect also the validity of the
results. However, the results of items which investigate the same aspects of OA
publishing support each other (e.g. concerning green OA) and are in line with previous
research.
With regards to the design of the survey, some improvements could be made in case a
follow-up study is conducted. Some questions in the survey received a large proportion
of responses for the “neither disagree not agree” alternative. The tendency that
respondents choose this option may indeed be indicative of that opinion, but it may also
imply that respondents do not know what to answer. In other words, it could be useful
to also include the option of responding “I do not know” to some question items.
Altogether, the tendency shows that those questions need further examination.
Similarly, the questions which consisted of forced ranking scales could have benefitted
from providing a N/A alternative. Some respondents took the opportunity to explain
their views in the open-ended questions at the end of the survey, which can be
considered to enhance the validity of the responses.
As observed in the research literature on survey studies (Creswell & Creswell 2018),
there is a central difference between self-reported awareness and knowledge and reallife awareness and knowledge. For instance, respondents may underestimate or
overestimate their awareness and knowledge of OA issues, and act differently in reallife situations compared to how they have reported in the survey. There is also a
probability that respondents answer in a way they (consciously or unconsciously) think
the researcher wants. This bias is almost inevitable in survey studies, and to cover it,
other research strategies need to be applied.
The nonresponse rate affects the reliability of the results of the survey. In total 59
respondents can be considered a decent number of participants, but these represent only
a minority of the total amount of researchers at FHPT. The representativeness of the
respondents who decided to participate in the study is a central aspect to consider when
assessing the results. For example, it could be assumed that those researchers, who are
already familiar with OA and are positive about OA, are more likely to participate in the
survey in the first place, compared to those who are not familiar with OA at all. A
potential explanation to the large share of doctoral students among the participants is
111

Malin Fredriksson 2020

that OA issues is more and more emphasized for early career researchers. In the cover
letter, it was mentioned that also those who do not have experience of OA could
participate in the survey. The purpose was to encourage researchers who did not have
experience of OA publishing. Because of these response biases, the results do not
represent the voice of all researchers at FHPT.
Assessment of the entire study
The limitations with regards to whether the results can be generalized (external
validity), or directly compared to previous studies, are characteristic to case studies
(Creswell & Creswell 2018). Despite the limitations and problem areas regarding the
reliability and validity of the results, the overall results of the present study are in line
with previous research.
Another central limitation relates to the mainly quantitative approach. The quantitative
approach has provided a more extensive and versatile insight into the current situation
in humanities at ÅAU than qualitative methods would have provided. However, it is not
possible to know how respondents have reasoned when responding to the survey. At the
same time, attitudes and motivations are constantly subject to change, and similar
responses cannot be guaranteed.
Initially, the scope of this case study can be considered broad in nature, at the same time
as it is impossible to study all aspects of OA publishing, even in a defined
organizational or institutional context. The empirical data retrieved for both sub-studies
were rich and versatile, and opportunities for forthcoming analyses remain. The present
multi-method study has been fruitful for mapping critical developments in the transition
towards OA publishing in humanities, from the perspective of researcher.

6.4.

Suggestions for further research

Research on OA publishing is a rapidly growing research topic, and also from the
present study central themes for further research emerge. Forthcoming changes and
improvements in the annual national publication collection of universities will provide
new venues for research in patterns of scholarly publishing at Finnish universities.
Starting 2021, additional OA attributes such as information on embargoes, the use of
open licenses, and APC costs, will be included in the publication collection. Although
112

Malin Fredriksson 2020

these OA attributes have not been accessible when conducting the present study, the
results from the survey suggest that open licenses and APCs are potential areas of
interest. Overall, the OA attributes which will be included in the forthcoming
publication collection nationally will increase the potential to assess the development of
OA in Finnish institutions in higher education from a more versatile and long-term
perspective.
The limitations of both sub-studies open up venues for further research. The focus of the
present study has been on humanities, but similar studies in other fields of science or
faculties at ÅAU, or at other research organizations, would benefit from a similar
approach. The survey can be replicated at the same faculty (FPHT) to monitor changes
in awareness, knowledge and perceptions over time. In addition, the survey can be
conducted also at other faculties to retrieve results that can be used to compare the
awareness, knowledge and experience of OA publishing at different faculties. Similarly,
combined with an analysis of publication data within the concerned fields of science, it
is possible to take the characteristics of the disciplines into account.
The results of the study also reflect broader issues and challenges in the transition
towards OA publishing. To gain an even deeper understanding of the transition towards
OA from the perspective of researchers, a qualitative approach would be useful.
Qualitative methods can be used to examine how researchers understand their roles as
producers of new scientific knowledge and their role in the transition towards OA.

6.5.

Conclusion

Both from an international and national perspective, the transition towards an increasing
proportion of OA research literature has taken large steps within only a few years.
Although the results of this case study cannot be used to make strict conclusions about
the past and the future, they give a diverse insight into the ongoing transition in
scholarly publishing and communication in humanities in particular.
The objectives for OA publishing as defined in the Finnish national policy and Plan S
can be regarded ambitious, despite the fact that the total proportion of publications
which are available in OA in some form has more than doubled since the monitoring of
OA was initiated some years ago (Ilva 2020a, Ilva 2020b). According to Plan S (2018),
scholarly publications based on research funded by public or private research funders
113

Malin Fredriksson 2020

must be available as OA, with effect from 2021. According to the Finnish national
strategy, all research should be publicly available by 2022. This ambitious objective can
be considered challenging to reach, as selecting OA publication channels for publishing
is not an end in itself for researchers. Critical voices have also been raised about the
implications for academic freedom, when OA mandates and policies are about to affect
researchers’ decisions of where to publish.
It emerges as central to consider how researchers evaluate which routes to OA are
viable options in their fields of research, and how their decision-making can be
supported in a way that is in line with sustainable OA options. Simultaneously, the
development of sustainable models for OA monograph publishing will affect the OA
publishing landscape in a remarkable way. In the rapidly changing landscape of
scholarly communication and publishing today, it remains central to continue asking
researchers what they think about disseminating their research outputs as openly as
possible also in the future.

7. Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Övergången till öppen publicering inom humaniora:
En fallstudie om forskares publiceringsmönster, uppfattningar om och
erfarenheter av öppen publicering vid ett finländskt universitet
Introduktion
Under de senaste årtiondena har formerna för formell vetenskaplig publicering och
vetenskaplig kommunikation gått igenom omfattande förändringar. De här
förändringarna handlar dels om ett skifte från att forskare publicerat i tryckt format till
att publicera digitalt, dels från att publicera i avgiftsbelagda prenumerationstidskrifter
till att publicera öppet tillgängligt för alla på internet, det vill säga open access (OA)
(De Silva & Candace 2017; Mukherjee 2009). I denna avhandling granskas övergången
till öppen publicering inom humaniora, med ett finländskt universitet som fallstudie.
OA-rörelsen fick sin början bland universitetsbibliotek och forskare i USA i början av
1990-talet som en reaktion mot kommersiella förlags allt större vinststrävanden inom
vetenskaplig publiceringsverksamhet. De allt högre prenumerationspriserna ledde till en
ohållbar situation för universitetsbibliotek och andra organisationer vars syfte är att
tillhandahålla vetenskaplig litteratur för studeranden, forskare och övriga anställda vid
universitet (Laakso et al 2011). Än idag betalar universitetsbibliotek och
forskningsorganisationer över hela världen en stor del av sina årsbudgeter för att ge
tillgång till den senaste forskningslitteraturen som finns bakom betalvägg (Larivière,
Haustein & Mongeon 2015). Det här innebär dessutom att forskningsresultaten inte är
tillgängliga för samhälleliga aktörer och den breda allmänheten, och att forskningen inte
kan komma dem till nytta. Därför handlar OA-rörelsens målsättningar om att göra
vetenskapliga digitala publikationer fritt tillgängliga för alla. Med detta som bakgrund
innebär öppen tillgång till forskningsresultat en demokratisering av kunskap och
förutsättningar för ökad spridning och genomslagskraft i samhället. Centrala begrepp
som öppen tillgång eller öppen publicering kan inte definieras på ett entydigt sätt, men
utgångspunkten är att öppet tillgänglig vetenskaplig litteratur finns digitalt på internet

115

Malin Fredriksson 2020

och inte kostar något för läsaren, samt är fritt från de flesta begränsningar vad gäller
upphovsrätt och licenser (Suber 2012).
Därtill kan öppen publicering delas in i flera typer. Guld OA är publikationer som är
omedelbart öppet tillgängliga för läsare. I guld OA-publikationskanaler är alla artiklar
öppet tillgängliga. Hybrid OA är prenumerationstidskrifter som gör en del artiklar öppet
tillgängliga som en avgiftsbelagd tilläggstjänst. Grön OA, som även kallas
parallellpublicering eller självarkivering, innebär att författaren själv (utan kostnad)
delar den version av artikeln som utgivaren tillåter i ett institutionellt repositorium eller
annat öppet digitalt arkiv (Laakso et al 2011, Suber 2012).
Under de senaste åren har flera initiativ och implementeringsprogram utformats på
internationell och nationell nivå för att möjliggöra en övergång till ökad öppen
publicering. Till de mest inflytelserika internationella initiativen hör Plan S (2018) som
är ett europeiskt initiativ för att främja öppen publicering av vetenskapliga artiklar.
Bakom initiativet står cOAlition S, ett konsortium bestående av främst europeiska
forskningsfinansiärer, bland dem Finlands Akademi som hör till de största
forskningsfinansiärerna i Finland. Målet för Plan S (2018) är att vetenskapliga
publikationer som produceras inom forskningsprojekt som genomförs med offentliga
eller privata medel ska omedelbart göras helt öppet tillgängliga fr.o.m. år 2021.
I Finland rapporterar universiteten årligen antalet vetenskapliga publikationer, som
producerats av forskare och anställda vid universiteten, till Undervisnings- och
kulturministeriet. Antalet rapporterade referentgranskade publikationer och deras
vetenskapliga kvalitet (t.ex. klassificering i Publikationsforum) utgör grunden för
beräkningen av en viss andel av universitetens grundfinansiering med offentliga medel
(Undervisnings- och kulturministeriet 2020). Öppen publicering betonas allt mer i
universitetens nya finansieringsmodell som träder i kraft år 2021, enligt vilken öppet
tillgängliga publikationer (guld, hybrid, grön) ger universiteten mer finansiering än
motsvarande stängd publikation. Med andra ord är det av betydande intresse för
universiteten att rapportera alla referentgranskade publikationer på ett korrekt sätt,
inklusive information om publikationernas OA-status, och att även öka andelen
publikationer med öppen tillgång överlag (Ilva 2017, 2019).

116

Malin Fredriksson 2020

Tidigare forskning och litteraturöversikt
Inom forskningen kring OA-publicering granskas förändringarna inom vetenskaplig
publicering och kommunikation ur flera olika perspektiv. Ett centralt forskningsområde
är den kvantitativa utvecklingen av andelen OA-publikationer inom olika discipliner.
Tidigare forskning noterar att utvecklingen mot öppen publicering skett relativt
långsamt under flera decennier, trots allt mer välutvecklad digital informationsteknologi
och allt bättre forskningsinfrastruktur (Holopainen & Koskinen 2016, Laakso et al 2011,
Suber 2012). Överlag har andelen publikationer som finns öppet tillgängliga i någon
form (guld, hybrid, grön) av den totala mängden vetenskapliga publikationer ökat mer
markant under de allra senaste åren (t.ex. Archambault et al 2014, Ilva 2020a, Laakso et
al 2011, Piwowar et al 2018, Solomon et al 2013).
Humaniora som disciplin är av särskilt intresse inom forskningen kring utvecklingen
mot ökad öppen publicering. Tidigare forskning visar att förändringen mot ökad öppen
publicering varit långsammare inom humaniora än inom andra discipliner (Coonin &
Younce 2010, Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015). En delorsak anses vara särdragen för
vetenskaplig publicering inom humaniora. Det mest framträdande draget för publicering
inom humaniora är att referentgranskade monografier hör till de mest centrala formerna
av vetenskaplig publicering vid sidan av referentgranskade artiklar i tidskrifter, medan
publicering av monografier är mer ovanligt inom övriga discipliner. Inom
naturvetenskaper, medicin och teknik är andelen referentgranskade artiklar och
konferenspublikationer mer typiska (Darley, Reynolds & Wickham 2014, GiménezToledo & Román-Román 2009, Puuska 2014). Vad gäller öppen publicering har fokus
för internationella OA-initiativ såsom Plan S (2018) i första hand handlat om
publicering av vetenskapliga artiklar. Däremot har initiativen till öppen publicering av
monografier inte varit lika framgångsrika i att förverkligas. Hållbara modeller för OApublicering av monografier är fortfarande inte lika välutvecklade som för vetenskapliga
artiklar (Eve 2014, Williams et la 2009).
För att förstå och kartlägga förändringen ur forskarsamfundets synvinkel är forskares
uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av olika typer av öppen publicering (t.ex. Coonin &
Younce 2010, Gross & Charles 2015, Rodriguez 2014, Rowley et al 2017),
publiceringsmönster på institutionell nivå (i finländsk kontext bl.a. Ilva 2017, Ilva 2018,
Ilva 2019, Ilva 2020a, Ilva 2020b), samt universitetsbibliotekens roll i att stöda forskare
117

Malin Fredriksson 2020

t.ex. genom tjänster för parallellpublicering (t.ex. Ala-Kyyny 2018, Björk et al 2014,
Kim 2011, Klain-Gabbay & Shoham 2018) centrala aspekter att beakta. Den här studien
rör sig mellan dessa delområden för att ge en helhetsbild och analysera övergången mot
ökad öppen publicering vid en bestämd utbildningsorganisation i ljuset av
internationella och nationella utvecklingstrender.
Studiens syfte och frågeställningar
Studiens övergripande syfte är att granska den pågående övergången från publicering i
stängda publikationskanaler till öppen publicering inom formell vetenskaplig
kommunikation inom humaniora. För att förstå och belysa övergången inom
vetenskaplig publicering och kommunikation granskar den här avhandlingen forskares
publiceringsmönster, uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av öppen publicering i ett
finländskt sammanhang och en avgränsad utbildningsorganisation, med andra ord som
en fallstudie. Humaniora vid Åbo Akademi fungerar som fallstudie.
1) Den första forskningsfrågan handlar om hurdana publiceringsmönster är typiska
inom humaniora och på vilket sätt öppen publicering utgör en del av dessa
mönster. Inom denna fråga granskas inom ramen för fallstudien andelen
referentgranskade publikationer med öppen tillgång som producerats inom
humaniora, i jämförelse med andelen inom övriga vetenskapsområden vid Åbo
Akademi. Därtill granskas andelen publikationer av olika typer av öppen tillgång
(guld, hybrid, grön) och klassificering i Publikationsforum i jämförelse med
övriga vetenskapsområden.
2) Den andra forskningsfrågan handlar om i vilken utsträckning forskare inom
humaniora har kännedom och kunskaper om, samt erfarenheter av öppen
publicering, liksom hurdana uppfattningar de har. Frågan berör forskarnas
självrapporterade kännedom, kunskaper, uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av
olika typer av öppen publicering (guld, hybrid, grön). Därtill granskas vilka
faktorer de anser hindra och möjliggöra öppen publicering för forskare.
Metod och genomförande
Med fallstudie avses ett närmandesätt som belyser ett fenomen ur flera perspektiv för att
ge en djupgående insikt i ett empiriskt fenomen i en bestämd organisation inom en
avgränsad tidsram (Yin 2014). För att få en övergripande och mångsidig bild av
situationen för öppen publicering inom humaniora vid ÅA tillämpas kvantitativa
118

Malin Fredriksson 2020

metoder. Kvantitativa metoder ger möjlighet att samla in en stor mängd rikt, strukturerat
data som kan användas för att göra jämförelser och slutsatser om förekommande
tendenser (Creswell & Creswell 2018).
Typiskt för fallstudier är att flera datainsamlingsmetoder används för att ge en
mångsidig inblick i fenomenet som studeras (Creswell & Creswell 2018). Även om bl.a.
Korzilius (2010a, 2010b) noterar att kvantitativa metoder inte är det typiska valet av
metod i fallstudier, bedömdes kvantitativa metoder lämpliga för att genomföra den här
fallstudien. Kvantitativa data ger en mångsidig och rik bild av övergången mot öppen
publicering inom humaniora vid Åbo Akademi, vilket är värdefullt i sig då det inte finns
tidigare kartläggningar eller studier om situationen. I fallstudien tillämpas därför två
separata datainsamlingsmetoder, och det material som samlas in analyseras i två olika
delstudier. Dessa används för att ge svar på separata men nära sammanhängande
forskningsfrågor om forskarnas publiceringsmönster, uppfattningar om och erfarenheter
av olika typer av öppen publicering.
Delstudie I är en studie av publiceringsmönster inom humaniora i jämförelse med
övriga vetenskapsområden vid ÅA (vetenskapsområden enligt Statistikcentralen 2010).
Delstudie I utgår från publikationsdata (bestående av bibliografiskt data) som samlats in
i samband med Utbildnings- och kulturministeriets årliga publikationsdatainsamling.
För att kartlägga forskares publiceringsmönster hämtades publikationsdata för
referentgranskade publikationer av publikationstyp A (referentgranskade vetenskapliga
artiklar) och C (vetenskapliga böcker, monografier) som utkommit år 2018 inom
samtliga vetenskapsområden vid ÅA. Publikationsdatat finns tillgängligt i databasen
Virta och hämtades genom användargränssnittet Juuli under våren 2020.
Publikationsdatat används för att analysera skillnader i fördelningen mellan
publikationstyper, typer av öppen tillgång (guld, grön, hybrid) samt publikationers
klassificering i Publikationsforum mellan humaniora och övriga vetenskapsområden. De
rapporterade publikationerna kan ses som en indikator på faktiskt publiceringsbeteende.
Delstudie II är en studie av forskares uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av öppen
publicering inom humaniora. För att kartlägga kännedom, kunskaper och uppfattningar
om samt erfarenheter av öppen publicering bland forskare inom humaniora utfördes en
elektronisk enkät våren 2020. Enkäten skickades ut via e-postlistor för personal och
forskare vid Fakulteten för humaniora, psykologi och teologi. Enkäten utformades
119

Malin Fredriksson 2020

utgående från Gaines (2015) enkätstudie om uppfattningar om och erfarenheter av
öppen publicering i en nordamerikansk kontext. Gaines’ (2015) enkät valdes som
utgångspunkt eftersom den innehåller ett brett spektrum av frågor angående öppen
publicering. Dessutom anpassades enkäten för att gälla den finländska kontexten och
Åbo Akademi som organisation. Enkäten bestod av 18 stängda frågor samt två öppna
frågor. Enkäten bestod av frågor gällande kännedom, kunskaper, uppfattningar om och
erfarenheter av olika typer av öppen publicering, samt bakgrundsinformation (ålder,
akademisk position, kön, ämne/utbildningsprogram vid FHPT).
Presentation av centrala resultat i delstudie I och II
I delstudie I kartläggs fördelningen av publikationstyper inom samtliga
vetenskapsområden vid ÅA (naturvetenskaper, teknik, medicin- och hälsovetenskaper,
samhällsvetenskaper samt humanistiska vetenskaper) enligt Statistikcentralens (2010)
indelning av vetenskapsområden. Den tredje största andelen publikationer (A, C) av
ÅA:s totala antal vetenskapliga publikationer under år 2018 rapporterades inom
humaniora, efter naturvetenskaper och samhällsvetenskaper (Figur 3). Inom humaniora
är andelen referentgranskade artiklar (A1) minst i jämförelse med övriga
vetenskapsområden, även om A1 fortsättningsvis utgör den vanligaste
publikationstypen. I jämförelse med övriga vetenskapsområden var andelen
publikationer i A3, C1 och C2 betydligt större inom humaniora och utgör därmed
karaktäristiska drag för vetenskapsområdet (Figur 4).
Därefter granskades andelen öppna publikationer (guld, hybrid, grön) inom samtliga
vetenskapsområden för publikationstyp A vid ÅA (Figur 5). Andelen guld OA för
referentgranskade artiklar (A) var näst störst inom humaniora, efter medicin och
hälsovetenskaper, medan den minsta andelen fanns inom teknik. Tilläggsvärdet av
parallellpublicering (antalet publikationer som kvarstår då man utesluter publikationer
som finns både tillgängliga som guld OA eller hybrid, och därtill blivit
parallellpublicerade) inom humaniora var på god nivå i jämförelse med övriga
vetenskapsområden. Andelen artiklar i hybridtidskrifter var minst inom humaniora
jämfört med andra vetenskapsområden. Största delen artiklar i stängda
publikationskanaler fanns inom teknik, medan den minsta fanns i medicin och
hälsovetenskaper. Humaniora placerades mellan de två ytterligheterna. För att
ytterligare granska OA-publicering inom humaniora granskades graden av öppenhet i
120

Malin Fredriksson 2020

alla publikationstyper inom humaniora (Figur 6). Inom humaniora stod bokartiklar
(A3), monografier (C1) och redigerade verk (C2) för största delen av de stängda
publikationerna.
För att kartlägga rutterna (guld, hybrid, grön) till öppen publicering för publikationer på
olika nivåer (1–3) i Publikationsforum granskades fördelningen inom samtliga
vetenskapsområden (publikationstyp A) tillsammans (Figur 7). Största delen av guld
OA fanns på nivå 1 (lägsta nivån). Andelen guld OA på nivå 2 och 3 var hälften mindre.
Tilläggsvärdet av parallellpublicering var störst på nivå 3 (högsta nivån). Den totala
andelen öppet tillgängliga publikationer (guld, hybrid, grön) var störst på nivå 1, medan
den största andelen stängda publikationer var på nivå 2. Därtill granskades rutterna till
OA på olika nivåer i Publikationsforum inom humaniora (Figur 8). Andelen guld OA på
nivå 1 och 2 i humaniora var större jämfört med andelen i alla vetenskapsområden
tillsammans. På nivå 3 inom humaniora var andelen stängda publikationer avsevärt
större än inom övriga vetenskapsområden.
I delstudie II deltog sammanlagt 59 forskare vid FHPT (83 % av alla som börjat fylla i
slutförde enkäten). Av respondenterna var 26 doktorander, medan 33 hörde till övriga
forskarkategorier (professorer, undervisningspersonal, postdoktorala forskare, samt
övriga) (Tabell 2). Det fanns doktorander i alla ålderskategorier, medan forskare i de
andra kategorierna (dvs. med längre karriär) tenderade att vara äldre (Tabell 3).
Kvinnliga doktorander utgjorde den största enskilda gruppen av respondenter (Tabell 4).
Drygt hälften av respondenterna hörde till utbildningslinjen för kultur, historia och
filosofi, medan resten fördelades över utbildningslinjerna för språk, teologi, psykologi
och logopedi (Tabell 5).
Mer erfarna forskare påvisade mer erfarenhet av publicering i guld OA-tidskrifter,
hybridtidskrifter och parallellpublicering (Tabell 6, 7, 8). Dessutom hade mer erfarna
forskare i större utsträckning deltagit i utbildning om OA-frågor, jämfört med
doktorander (Tabell 9). De respondenter som deltagit i utbildning tenderade också att ha
erfarenheter av öppen publicering i större utsträckning än de som inte deltagit i
utbildning (Tabell 10, 11, 12).
Överlag påvisade forskarna en hög grad av kännedom och kunskaper om öppen
publicering (Figur 10). Det förekom dock skillnader mellan olika forskargrupper. Mer
erfarna forskare (professorer, postdoktorala forskare och universitetslärare) höll i högre
121

Malin Fredriksson 2020

grad med om påståendena än doktorander, och påvisade på så sätt en högre grad av
kännedom och kunskaper än doktorander. Skillnaden gentemot doktorander var särskilt
framträdande vad gäller ÅA:s policy för öppen vetenskap och Finlands Akademis krav
på öppen publicering. Resultaten visar även att särskilt grön OA är ett svårt begrepp för
många forskare.
Vad gäller uppfattningar om öppen publicering höll respondenterna överlag i hög grad
med om påståendena om olika OA-principer, t.ex. att forskning finansierad med
offentliga medel ska göras öppet tillgänglig, att forskare ska få behålla upphovsrätten
och tillåta användning för andra, och att OA-tidskrifter är av lika kvalitet som
prenumerationstidskrifter (Figur 11). Mer erfarna forskare tenderade att i högre grad
hålla med om en del påståenden än doktorander.
Det är även väldigt viktigt för forskare att andra forskare, samhällsaktörer och den breda
allmänheten kan läsa ens forskning. Drygt hälften av respondenterna ansåg att centrala
forskare inom deras områden publicerar med öppen tillgång. Ca 66 % ansåg att de
fördrar att publicera OA och 89 % att de vill publicera OA i framtiden (Figur 12). Vad
gäller uppfattningar om institutionellt stöd för OA-publicering ansåg drygt 80 % att
forskningsmiljön och ÅA-kollegerna är positivt inställda till OA, medan nästan lika stor
andel ansåg att det är rätt att ÅA:s policy för öppen vetenskap kräver öppen publicering
(Figur 13).
I enkäten tog respondenterna även ställning till frågor om framtiden för öppen
publicering (Figur 14). Jämfört med övriga frågor i enkäten kan en större osäkerhet
urskiljas i svaren. Drygt 40 % höll i någon grad med om att prenumerationstidskrifter
fortsättningsvis kommer att vara den viktigaste publikationskanalen, medan 13 % inte
höll med i någon grad. Knappt 70 % höll i någon grad med om att COVID-19
(koronakrisen våren 2020) har gjort OA allt viktigare.
Respondenterna ansåg att publikationens relevans inom forskningsområdet,
publikationens prestige och kvalitet, samt avsaknad av APC-kostnad, var de viktigaste
faktorerna i val av publikationskanal (Figur 15). Däremot var publikationskanalens OAstatus och möjligheter till parallellpublicering jämförelsevis mindre relevanta, även om
de överlag bedömdes som relevanta. Mer erfarna forskare ansåg i större utsträckning än
doktorander att OA-status är en relevant eller väldigt relevant faktor när man väljer
publikationskanal.
122

Malin Fredriksson 2020

I enkäten granskades även forskares uppfattningar om vilka faktorer som de uppfattar är
barriärer och möjliggörare för att göra sin forskning öppet tillgänglig. OA-tidskrifter av
hög kvalitet inom ens forskningsområde ansågs vara den viktigaste faktorn som
möjliggör öppen publicering, medan betalning av APC-kostnader var den näst viktigaste
(Figur 16). Det här resultaten stämmer överens med de upplevda barriärerna (Figur 17).
Att inte kunna betala för APC och att OA-publikationerna inom ens forskningsområde
inte är av god vetenskaplig kvalitet hörde till de mest centrala upplevda barriärerna.
Frågan om APC och OA-publikationers kvalitet lyftes även särskilt fram i de öppna
frågorna i enkäten.
Diskussion och avslutning
Den här fallstudien ger en mångsidig bild av situationen för öppen publicering inom
humaniora vid Åbo Akademi. Studien ger i första hand en inblick i en situation som för
närvarande är i ständig förändring och därmed är det svårt att dra slutsatser om
situationen på längre sikt. Upplägget som fallstudie gör att resultaten inte direkt kan
jämföras med tidigare studier eller generaliseras till andra sammanhang, men resultaten
reflekterar i alla fall centrala drag inom övergången till öppen publicering inom
humaniora.
Publiceringsmönstren inom humaniora vid ÅA stämmer överens med typiska
publiceringsmönster som identifierats i tidigare forskning (Darley, Reynolds &
Wickham 2014, Kulczycki et al (2018), Giménez-Toledo & Román-Román 2009,
Puuska 2014). Analysen av publikationsdatat visar nämligen att publicering i
monografier är ett framträdande drag också inom humaniora vid ÅA. Situationen för
publicering med öppen tillgång kan anses vara på god nivå inom humaniora vid ÅA och
stämmer överlag överens med den centrala utvecklingen på nationell nivå (Ilva 2017,
2018, 2019, 2020a, b).
I likhet med tidigare studier visade enkätresultaten att forskare överlag håller starkt med
om påståenden angående principerna om öppen publicering och dess fördelar. Därtill
visade enkätstudien i viss mån en högre grad av medhållande jämfört med äldre studier
(Gaines 2015, Gross & Ryan 2015, Rodriguez 2014). Fallstudien visar även i likhet med
tidigare studier (Solomon & Björk 2013, Zhu 2017) att bl.a. publikationens prestige och
kvalitet inom det egna forskningsområdet hör till de viktigaste faktorerna då forskare

123

Malin Fredriksson 2020

väljer publikationskanal. Med andra ord är val av OA-publiceringskanal inte ett
självändamål.
Ur både ett nationellt och internationellt perspektiv har utvecklingen mot ökad öppen
publicering tagit stora steg framåt under de senaste åren. Plan S och den nationella
strategin för öppen publicering kan framstå ambitiösa, särskilt i ljuset av att val av
öppna publikationskanaler inte är ett självändamål för forskare. Frågorna om OAtidskrifters kvalitet och prestige, liksom hur APC-avgifter betalas framstår som väldigt
centrala ur forskarnas synvinkel. Särskilt betydande för humaniora är även hur modeller
för öppen publicering av monografier utvecklas. I dagens föränderliga
publiceringslandskap är det centralt att fortsätta fråga forskare vad de tänker om att
distribuera sina forskningsresultat så öppet som möjligt också i framtiden.

Appendix 1. Survey

131

Study on FHPT researchers' experiences of and views on open
access publishing
Invitation to participate
The aim of this survey is to map the experiences of and views on open access
publishing among doctoral students, researchers and teachers at the Faculty of
Arts, Psychology and Theology at Åbo Akademi University. To respond, you do
not need to have previous experience of open access publishing.
Responding to the survey takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Participation is
anonymous. For the presentation of results and data archiving, the data will be
further anonymized. Units and groups with few respondents will not be
presented as such. The anonymized research data will be made openly available
in the Finnish Social Science Data Archive.
The survey is part of a master's thesis project in information studies. If you
have any questions, please contact student Malin Fredriksson
(malin.fredriksson@abo.ﬁ)
Supervisors: Prof. Gunilla Widén, Information studies (gunilla.widen@abo.ﬁ) and
PhD Yrsa Neuman, open science project manager (yrsa.neuman@abo.ﬁ)
