This thesis explores the impact of social media overload on information avoidance and
discontinuation of social media use. Three dimensions of social media overload were adopted:
information overload, social overload, and system feature overload. The stress-strain-outcome
model is used to hypothesize that these three overload factors affect the strain factor (social
media exhaustion). In turn, social media exhaustion causes both information avoidance and
discontinuance of the use of social media. The existence of a relationship between information
avoidance and discontinuance of social media use is also hypothesized. To test the proposed
model, data from 125 social media users were collected and analysed using SmartPLS 3.0
software. The analysis results show that information overload and social overload positively
affect social media exhaustion. System feature overload had no effect on social media
exhaustion. Social media exhaustion had positive effects on both information avoidance and
discontinued use of social media. The relationship between information avoidance and
discontinuance of use was non-significant.

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

1 Introduction
This chapter will first explain the background and motivation of this study. It will then describe
the research gaps and present the research questions.

1.1 Background and motivation
Social media has become an important part of social life, and today, millions use social media
sites for communicating with each other. A social networking site (SNS) is an online service
used widely in everyday life. Among the available SNSs, Facebook is the most used, with 2.7
billion active users monthly.1 Social media platforms afford interactions among users in the form
of creating, sharing, and exchanging information (Ahlqvist et al., 2008; Mäntymäki and Islam,
2014; Islam et al., 2020; Whelan et al., 2020). These platforms allow the creation and exchange
of user-generated content with Web 2.0 websites (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010). Social media
technologies can be tentatively classified into six categories, as suggested by Kaplan and
Haenlein (2010): collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia), blogs and microblogs (e.g., Twitter),
video-based social media platforms (e.g., YouTube), social networking sites (e.g., Facebook),
virtual game worlds (e.g., World of Warcraft), and virtual social worlds (e.g., Second Life). This
thesis is conducted in the context of social networking sites.
Prior research has reported possible positive and negative impacts of social media use in day-today life (e.g., Islam et al., 2019, 2020; Whelan et al., 2020). When people overuse social media,
they often lose control over their use, which in turn leads to addiction (Whelan et al., 2020). The
overuse of social media reduces users’ mindfulness, and they therefore pay less attention to their
day-to-day life activities and work life. Social media platforms afford the building of social
capital (Ellison et al., 2007) and promote well-being (Dhir et al., 2018), but at the same time,
using social media platforms creates frustration and dissatisfaction in users’ lives (Laumer et al.,
2015). Prior literature has suggested that overusing social media may lead to stress (Maier et al.,
2015), fatigue (Bright et al., 2015), depression (Brooks and Longstreet, 2015), narcissism

(Brailovskaia and Margraf, 2016), social overload (Cao and Sun, 2018), communication
overload (Cho et al., 2011), and information overload (Milord and Perry, 1977) among users.

1.2 Research gaps and research questions
Using social media to exchange messages, update statuses, or share posts is sometimes
informative if done purposefully. Prior literature has suggested that in social media, users receive
many messages and many times, people are obligated to reply in order to maintain the network
(Maier et al., 2015a). Sometimes these requests require some sort of feedback (Brandtzaeg 2012;
Manago et al., 2012), which create extra strain on users’ well-being, and usage of social media
increases too (Amichai, 2013). When people send requests and messages on social media, the
recipients feel the urge to respond. However, this state of affairs can be described as an
exhausting social situation in which the users think that they are giving enormous social support
to others who are on their social networking sites. At this point, social overload comes into play.
Prior literature has identified four major dimensions of social media overload: information
overload, communication overload, connection overload, and system feature overload (Lee et al.,
2016; Whelan et al. 2020). Prior studies have also investigated several outcomes of social media
overload (Lee et al., 2016; Whelan et al., 2020). Among these outcomes, information avoidance
and discontinuation of use are least discussed (Fu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). Indeed, a few
recent studies have investigated how social media overload causes discontinuation of the use of
social media (Fu et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2021). However, how social media overload affects
information avoidance is not well researched. Furthermore, the relationship between information
avoidance and discontinued use of social media has not been studied to a great extent.
Social media overload has an impact on users’ psychology and attitude and can create a negative
mindset for users (Maier et al., 2015a). Among the negative consequences, social media overload
has the worst consequences (Whelan et al., 2020). This thesis attempts to determine whether
social media overload can frustrate users, leading to information avoidance and discontinued use
of SNSs. Consequently, the following research questions are addressed in this thesis.
RQ1. How do the dimensions of social media overload lead to information avoidance?

INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

RQ2. How do the dimensions of social media overload lead to discontinued use of social media?
In order to answer the above research questions, a research model with a number of hypotheses
that capture the consequences of and causes of social media overload is developed. In particular,
the stressors-stress-outcome framework is used to build the research model. With a sample size
of 125 social networking site users and by using a partial least squares approach, the model is
tested and the hypotheses are evaluated.

1.3 Structure of the thesis
Chapter 1 is the introductory chapter, which introduces the topic and research questions. Then in
chapter 2, a detailed literature review has been conducted and subsequently research gaps have
been identified. Chapter 3 discusses the theoretical background, especially the stress-strainoutcome framework, and the key concepts are discussed. Chapter 4 focuses on developing a
research model and provides detailed justifications for the hypotheses. Thereafter, chapter 5
describes the research methodology, data analysis techniques, and results. Chapter 6 describes
the theoretical and practical implications of the thesis. Finally, chapter 7 concludes the paper and
presents limitations.

2 Literature review
This chapter conducts a literature review on social media overload. In particular, the
consequences of social media overload are identified. Thereafter, a summary of the literature
review is presented.

2.1 Related works
A literature review on social media overload, exhaustion, information avoidance, and
discontinuation of social media use is carried out in this thesis. Appendix A presents a list of
research studies that have been examined in this thesis. Table 1 presents a summary of the
examined literature. As this table shows, three relationships have primarily been investigated in
the prior literature: social media overload and discontinuation of use (e.g., Cao et al., 2017; Fu et
al., 2020), social media overload and fatigue (Lee et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2021), and social media
overload and exhaustion (Cao et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2020). Different theories have been used to
explain the phenomena, such as situation-organism-behaviour-consequence (S-O-B-C) (Whelan
et al., 2020), stressors-strain-outcomes (SSO) (Fu et al., 2020), person-environment fit model of
stress, and transactional theory of stress and coping (Lee et al., 2015).

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

2.1.1 Social media overload and discontinuation of use
Prior literature reported possible connection between social media overload and discontinued
use. For example, Cao et al. (2017) conducted a study among 358 Chinese social media users to
investigate how social media overload related factors impact discontinued use. They
conceptualized social media overload using information overload, communication overload, and
social overload. Their findings show that these overload dimensions impact discontinued use
intention through exhaustion and regret. Similarly, Fu et al. (2020) conducted their study among
412 Facebook users and found that social media exhaustion mediated the relationship between
social media overload and discontinued use. In contrast to Cao et al. (2017), Fu et al. (2020)
conceptualized social media overload using system feature overload, information overload and
social overload. Zhang et al. (2016) in their study reported that these social media overload
dimensions impact social media fatigue and dissatisfaction. In turn, both social media fatigue and
dissatisfaction influence discontinued use. Overall, according to prior literature, the effects of
social media overload on discontinued use have been investigated by placing mediator variables
such as social media exhaustion, fatigue, and dissatisfaction.

2.1.2 Social medial overload and fatigue
The relationship between social media overload and fatigue has been well-established in the
prior literature. Whelan et al. (2020) conducted a study with 286 students to investigate possible
connection among boredom proneness, social media overload, and social media fatigue. They
conceptualized social media overload using only information and communication overload.
Their study revealed that both information and communication overload influence social media
fatigue. The use of social media positively moderated the relationship between information
overload, communication overload, and social media fatigue. One notable limitation of this study
is that the authors did not use any overarching theory to build the research model. Lee et al.
(2015) on the other hand used person environment fit theory and coping theory to reveal that
information overload, communication overload, and system feature overload impact social media
fatigue. In this study, the authors also revealed possible factors that impact overload factors. For
example, the study reported that information equivocality positively impacts information
overload. Lin et al. (2020) reported that information overload, communication overload, and
social overload positively impact fatigue.

2.1.3 Social media overload and exhaustion
The relationship between social media overload and exhaustion has also been investigated in
prior literature. Some example research studies are highlighted briefly in this section. Maier
(2015) conducted a study among 571 Facebook users and reported that social overload positively
impacts social media exhaustion, which in turn impact discontinued use. Lingling (2019) found
that information overload positively influences exhaustion directly and indirectly via
technostress. Cao et al. (2017) also reported that information overload, communication overload
and social overload positively impact social media exhaustion.

2.2 Research Gaps
As explained earlier, prior studies have also investigated several outcomes of social media
overload such as social media fatigue, exhaustion, and dissatisfaction (Lee et al., 2016; Whelan
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016). A few studies also connected these outcomes with social media
discontinued use intention (Cao et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2020). However, information avoidance as
an outcome has not been discussed. Indeed, Sweeny et al. (2010) reported information avoidance
as an important behaviour that needs to be investigated in the social media context. It may be
that users first start to avoid information on social media before deciding to discontinue their use.
Therefore, it is important to identify the factors that drive users to avoid information on social
media. From the literature review, it was also observed that the relationship between information
avoidance and discontinued use of social media has not been studied in the prior literature. This
thesis fills these important research gaps by connecting social media overload factors, social
media exhaustion, information avoidance, and discontinued use intention.

3. Theoretical background
This chapter first presents the stressor-strain-outcome framework, which has been adopted in this
thesis. Next, discontinuation of social media use, information avoidance behaviour, and social
media exhaustion are described. Finally, the three stressors – information overload,
communication overload, and system feature overload – are discussed.

3.1. Stressor-strain-outcomes
The Stressor-strain-outcomes model (SSO) (shown in Figure 1) was first developed for
psychological research to investigate the impact of stressors on strain and outcome factors
(Koeske and Koeske, 1993). The theory describes how stressors impact strains and how strains
influence behavioural outcomes of users. “Stressors” refers to the environmental factors that
create stress and impact users psychologically (Newaz et al., 2018). The term “strain” refers to
the psychological outcomes caused by stressors. “Outcomes” are the results of stressors, which
influence strain responses (Newaz et al., 2018).
Figure 1. Stressors-Strain-Outcome model.

Outcome
The

SSO framework has been used in this thesis due to following reason. Prior literature has used the
SSO framework, especially in the area of technostress research (Tarafdar et al., 2019). The SSO
framework describes stress factors and how they affect outcomes (Dhir et al., 2018; RaguNathan et al., 2008). In the context of social media, different overload factors are the stressors.
The thesis seek to investigate how these stress factors impact outcome factors such as
information avoidance and discontinued use. Therefore, SSO framework deemed compatible to
the goal of this research. According to the SSO, stress factors impact strains. Dissatisfaction,
exhaustion, and regret act as the strains for social media users. These strains have diverse
12

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

outcomes, including discontinued usage, decreased academic performance, and information
avoidance (Cao et al., 2018; Dhir et al., 2018; Nawaz et al., 2018).
In the prior literature, the SSO framework has been used to explain discontinuation of the use of
social media (e.g., Fu et al., 2020; Lingling et al., 2019). Most of the research work has been
conducted on information system usage, and less has highlighted discontinuation of usage
behaviours based on the SSO framework (see Fu et al., 2020). SSO is an approach to discovering
the negative impacts of the stress factors and users’ discontinuation of usage behaviours.
Therefore, this framework is utilized in this thesis.
In this thesis, the stress factors examined are information overload, social overload, and system
feature overload. The strain is social media exhaustion, and the outcomes are the discontinuation
of usage of SNSs and information avoidance. In the following sections, these factors are
discussed in more detail.

3.2. Discontinuance of social media usage
Information system (IS) discontinuance has been examined in some studies as a post-adoption
behaviour (Shen et al., 2018). The post-adoption behaviour of IS continuance has been
highlighted more in the literature, but it might not be the opposite of discontinuance use (see
Turel et al., 2013). For example, several prior studies have argued that IS discontinuance is a
distinct behaviour and not just the other side of continuance (Chao and Sun, 2018; Shen et al.,
2018).
Most previous studies mainly focused on the reason for discontinuance among users. A study
done on stress factors suggested that using SNSs increases stress among users, and by
discontinuing, users are able to reduce the stress level (Maier et al., 2015b). According to another
empirical study, when the user is satisfied, intention of discontinuation and feelings of
discomfort are decreased. Furthermore, user guilt increases the intention to discontinue usage
(Turel, 2015).

13

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

3.3 Information avoidance
In today’s world, users receive information from a variety of sources, including social media, but
all the received information may not be relevant and useful. Information avoidance occurs when
the user comes across information that suppresses useful information. Information avoidance
leads a person not to look for correct information. This hampers proper information-seeking
behaviour and creates avoidance of important information (Sweeny et al., 2010). Moreover,
information avoidance might foster people’s unwillingness to ask for information and make them
avoid information (Wilson, 2000).
Prior research has suggested that people tend to intentionally avoid information because they do
not want to obtain updated information. For example, a study on genetic issues suggested that
partners often do not want to know the results of specific genetic tests of their partners – an
example of information avoidance (Yavin et al., 2004). Information can be useful, as it can
increase knowledge, well-being, peace, and opportunities. However, there could be several
reasons to avoid information. Cognitive dissonance is one possible reason (Fistinger et al., 1957),
which occurs when people hold contradictory thoughts, reasons, and vulnerable issues in their
minds that lead to stressful situations in their lives. According to the theory of cognitive
dissonance, when two ideas or thoughts collide, this affects people’s psychology by making them
uncomfortable with the situation and causing them to desire their thoughts to be consistent. The
new perceived information might change their thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions of the thinking
process. Therefore, people might avoid receiving new information, and information avoidance
might occur (Fistinger et al., 1957).
Excess information might create information overload, as humans have a small capacity for
processing information. For example, an athlete might not follow all up-to-date information
about his competitor because that might hamper his preparation and practice for games. A cancer
survivor might avoid news related to cancer because it might remind them of a painful period of
their life. Altogether, it can be concluded that a wide variety of factors might influence people to
avoid information.

INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

3.4 Social media exhaustion
Maier et al. (2015a) explained social media exhaustion as a common phenomenon and described
it as a factor that leads to the accumulation of stress among users. In social media, users
experience exhaustion when they need to participate in different activities, use different features,
and write comments on fragmented content. Social media exhaustion can be described as a selfevaluated perception of being tired from the use of social media (Whelan et al., 2020). According
to different research on social media exhaustion, social media use impacts users negatively and
keeps them under pressure, creating stress (Bright et al., 2015). Dhir et al. (2018) reported that
social media usage creates depression and anxiety among users, and Zhang et al. (2016) showed
that social media creates tiredness and exhaustion. Bright et al. (2015) reported four factors that
can influence social media exhaustion: privacy, social media confidence, social media
helpfulness, and self-efficacy. Other studies carried out by Dhir et al. (2018) and Bright et al.
(2018) found that the fear of missing out has an impact on social media exhaustion. This body of
research has examined the impact of social media exhaustion, but why people stop using social
media or what triggers them to stop using SNSs still merits attention.

3.5. Social media overload
In the previous literature, different dimensions of overload have been described (Fu et al., 2020;
Maier et al., 2015a; Whelan et al., 2020). Overload is a phenomenon that explains how people
become frustrated with the excess of something that is beyond their capacity to process. Previous
studies have also noted that overload can be a psychological outcome of users’ extensive search
processes for online purchases (Swar et al., 2017).
The kinds of overload people face, particularly in the context of social media, are system feature
overload, information overload, social overload, and communication overload (Fu et al., 2020;
Maier et al., 2015a; Whelan et al., 2020). This thesis examines information overload, social
overload, and system feature overload. Communication overload is not considered because it is
already covered by the social overload dimension. Social overload encompasses requests
(including communication requests) from others.

15

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

When the information received is more than one’s brain can process, information overload takes
place (Saegert, 1973). Overload is described as a phenomenon that impacts people negatively
and can lead to a negative outcome (Lee et al., 2011). Nowadays, people use the internet,
different social media platforms, emails, newspapers, and different kinds of mobile applications,
which can create overload (Davison et al., 2018). Overload negatively affects our decisionmaking capacity, decreases creativity and productivity, and creates dissatisfaction. Information
overload is a common phenomenon. Prior research has reported a number of possible factors that
create information overload, such as modern journalism, lack of evaluation of the authenticity of
the information, different platforms upon which information is shared, an abundance of historical
information, the ease of sharing information, and the ease of posting information on different
platforms (Bhasin, 2019). The abundance of information might also create fear of missing out,
which leads people to read more information, ultimately creating information overload (Hetz et
al., 2015).
System feature overload occurs when users are overloaded with technology features (Thompson
et al., 2005), especially when the number of features exceeds the value they add for users. Excess
availability of system features in the platforms may create cognitive burdens for the user, as they
need to learn how to use these features (Grandhi et al., 2005). In the case of Facebook and other
social media platforms, multiple features are offered to the users, which can create system
feature overload (Zhang et al., 2016).
Finally, social overload occurs when users have too many friends on social media and are unable
to maintain relationships due to huge demand. When people are unable to manage social
interaction and connections with people on social media due to volume, social media overload
occurs (McCarthy et al., 1978; Whelan et al., 2020).

INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

4. Research model development
The research model was developed based on the SSO framework (Koeske and Koeske, 1993).
SSO focuses on stress and strain factors of users and explains behavioural outcomes. As
described in the previous chapter, the term “stressors” represents different factors that create
stress. The term “strain” explains the psychological outcomes created by stressors. The outcome
can be defined as the response to strain. Therefore, SSO provides a framework for investigating
social media overload and discontinuation of usage.
In the research model, there are six hypotheses, as depicted in Figure 2. This thesis supports the
hypotheses based on findings from prior studies of social media. This thesis, therefore, observes
how information overload, system feature overload, and social overload cause users to
discontinue their use of social media. The study done by Maier et al. (2015a) explained
discontinuance behaviour based on social overload only. Social media overload has multiple
dimensions, and the dependence of discontinued use on these dimensions have not been
examined thoroughly in the previous literature (Fu et al., 2020). These dimensions can also affect
people’s information avoidance behaviour. This thesis studies three overload dimensions
thoroughly to gain a better understanding of overload in the social media context.
Past studies have provided the insight that the demographic characteristics of users have a role in
social media use. Therefore, demographic characteristics are included in the model as control
variables. In the following, the hypotheses included in the research model are described.

4.1. Information overload and social media exhaustion
Excessive use of social media can affect users’ cognitive states and make them too exhausted to
process information (Fu et al., 2020; Karr-Wisniewski et al., 2010; Whelan et al., 2020).
According to Ayyagari et al. (2011), when users search for information specific to their needs, it
may not overload them. However, when users encounter information that is not related to their
needs, they experience exhaustion. When users experience serendipitous information, they might
find it useful, but the new information might still create a cognitive overload, which could make
17

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

them psychologically exhausted. According to the study by Bright et al. (2015), information
overload is positively associated with social media exhaustion. Recently, Fu et al. (2020) also
validated this association. Thus, the following hypothesis is suggested:
H1: Information overload positively impacts social media exhaustion.

4.2. Social overload and social media exhaustion
Prior studies have claimed that social overload occurs when people encounter unnecessary
requests on social media (Maier et al., 2015a), which might in turn create dissatisfaction and
distraction (Evans et al., 1989). Nowadays, Facebook is used as a social media platform for
communicating with friends and maintaining net-based relationships (Ravindran et al., 2014).
When users receive comments or any sort of notification on Facebook, they feel an urge to
address the issue, which might create stress and exhaustion (Maier et al., 2015a). The negative
emotion arises as users receive many notifications, and sometimes, they feel irritated, as
receiving them makes them tired and stressed. Even with this type of stressful situation, users
often need to maintain a good number of relationships through Facebook. As people have limited
cognitive capacity, they cannot handle social overload (Zhang et al., 2016). When users have
more relationships to manage on Facebook, these extra social relationships affect their
psychological well-being (Kim and Lee, 2016). A study done by Salo et al. (2016) showed that
social overload has a positive impact on social exhaustion. Thus, the following hypothesis is
proposed:
H2: Social overload positively impacts social media exhaustion.

4.3. System feature overload and social media exhaustion
When a system updates its features very often, it might also create stress among users. Social
media service providers update features frequently and adjust the interface for users. This
frequent change of user interface and features might lead users to spend more time on Facebook
in order to become experienced with the new features, and very often it is found that these new
18

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

features are not in accordance with the users’ preferences (Ayyagari et al., 2011). Even if the
updated features are useful and meet users’ needs, some find the feature changes more difficult
than the previous. Thus, the updated features might create technical overload for users and social
media exhaustion (Lee et al., 2016). According to a study carried out by Ayyagari et al. (2016),
unnecessary updates in system features can create social media exhaustion. Lee et al. (2016)
explained how changes in system features may create stress and how system feature overload
due to the updating of features can create social media exhaustion. Thus, the following
hypothesis is suggested:
H3: System feature overload positively impacts social media exhaustion.

4.4 Social media exhaustion and information avoidance
Social media exhaustion is created by the different kinds of overload, which can lead to an
outcome such as information avoidance. This can be viewed as a coping mechanism for users.
When users are overly stressed and exhausted, they seek to take corrective action in order
remove the stressors. Lin et al. (2021) described how people adopt different coping strategies to
handle social media stressors. Based on this work, it can be suggested that by avoiding
information, people try to cope with stressors. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H4: Social media exhaustion positively impacts information avoidance.

4.5 Social media exhaustion, information avoidance, and
discontinuation of usage
According to a study carried out by Pires et al. (2018), when people experience psychological
exhaustion, it can affect their participation and lead them to reduce their use of social media
(Pires et al., 2018). Another study explained that when users experience exhaustion, they might
make behavioural changes regarding the use of social media (Cao et al., 2018). In other words,
when exhaustion takes place, it demotivates users from using social media (Luqman et al., 2017).
When people are exhausted and overloaded with social media, they might withdraw from social
19

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

media, and in some cases stop using social media altogether, even cancelling their social media
accounts (Dhir et al., 2019). The study carried out by Maier et al. (2015b) explained that social
exhaustion leads to discontinued usage behaviour. Furthermore, once users start to avoid
information on social media, they might decide to back away from social media itself. Thus, the
following hypotheses are proposed:
H5: Social media exhaustion positively impacts discontinuation of usage.
H6: Information avoidance positively impacts discontinuation of usage of social media.
Demographic variables – for example, age, gender, education, and frequency of use – can impact
social media usage (Cao et al., 2018). The negative impact of social media might vary based on
gender (McAndrew et al., 2012). Another study showed that age can impact the use of social
media and information technology (Ragu-Nathan et al., 2008). Discontinuation behaviour might
also be related to current frequency of use. Thus, demographic variables are added to provide a
wider understanding of discontinuation and information avoidance of social media users. The
demographic variables act as control variables in the research model to estimate the outcomes.
The research model is shown in Figure 2.

5. Research Methodology
This chapter describes the data collection strategies, followed by analysis and results.

5.1 Construct measurement
The research model was tested by collecting data from a survey. The items, which measured the
constructs in the research model, were based on the previous literature. The measurement items
were adapted to fit the context of the social media platform Facebook. After creating the initial
version of the questionnaire, it was sent to two senior researchers for their feedback. Based on
their feedback, some minor edits were made to the overall questionnaire.
For measuring information overload and system feature overload, the items developed by Zhang
et al. (2016) were used. The social overload items were adapted from the study of Maier et al.
(2015a), and the social media exhaustion and discontinued use items were taken from the study
of Maier et al. (2015b). Finally, for information avoidance, items from the studies of Cho (2004)
and Shin and Lin (2016) were used. A 5-point Likert scale was used to measure the construct
items with answers ranging from “strongly disagree (1)” to “strongly agree (5)”. The survey
items are presented in Appendix B.

5.2 Sample and data collection
An online survey was conducted to collect data from social media users. The online survey was
developed using Google Forms. The survey link was shared in six Facebook groups for
collecting data. The Facebook groups were related to research, student groups in the Turku area,
and university networks. The members of the groups ranged from approximately 200 to 10,000.
The author is a member of all these groups. The author herself posted the invitation in these
groups to participate in this research after receiving permission from the administrators of the
groups.

22

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

Before starting the survey, the respondents were told why the survey was important and why the
study was being conducted. It was also mentioned that the participants could leave at any time if
they did not want to participate anymore or wanted to stop answering. A total of 131 responses
were collected. After removing the invalid responses, 125 usable responses remained to test the
research model. The demographics of the respondents are shown in Appendix C.

5.3 Data analysis
For the data analysis and testing of the proposed research model, the partial least squares (PLS)
approach (Chin, 1998) was used. The SmartPLS 3.0 tool was used in this thesis to analyse the
data. With the help of SmartPLS 3.0, the reliability and accuracy of constructs were tested. The
significance level and path between the constructs were also measured. PLS is a regression
method that combines confirmatory factor analysis with linear regression. PLS is a reliable
approach for checking the validity of research models and testing hypotheses (Hair et al., 2017).
According to Hair et al. (2011) the covariance approach (CB) could also be used for this kind of
data analysis. However, PLS was preferred, as the sample size of this study was small. PLS is
considered to be a robust tool when the sample size is small (Hair et al., 2011).

5.4 Measurement model
According to Cook et al. (1979), measurement reliability is achieved when there is consistency
and stability present in a tested measurement. It can be checked by the item loadings, average
variance extracted (AVE), and composite reliability (CR). Table 2 values show that the CR
values and AVE for the constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5, respectively (Fornell and Larcker,
1981). In Figure 2, composite reliabilities are shown in the graph, which shows that the values
are above 0.7. In Figure 3, the AVE values are shown, which also demonstrates that the AVE
values for the constructs are above 0.5. Analysis of the test result thus ensures that the related
measurements have acceptable reliability (Moss et al., 1998). Table 3 shows the constructs and
the item loadings. In the construct of discontinuation of use, there were initially five items;
however, DU1 was removed because it was below 0.7. In the information avoidance construct,
IA1 and IA2 were removed, as their loadings were below the threshold. Information overload
23

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

item IO4 was also removed because of lower loading than the threshold. For the system feature
overload construct, SFO2 was removed due to insignificant loading.

Next, the tests for discriminant validity were conducted in three ways. First, the correlation
matrix (presented in Table 4) was checked. In this table, the diagonal values represent the square
25

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON

roots of AVEs. From the table, one can see that the square roots of the AVEs are greater than the
correlation values – this confirms the discriminant validity. Second, the HTMT table (presented
in Table 5) was also checked. From this table, one can see that the values are below 0.85 – this
also indicates that discriminant validity has been achieved. Finally, the cross-loadings table
(Table 6) was checked. From this table, one can see that the loadings were higher than the crossloadings. Altogether, these tests ensure that there is sufficient discriminant validity in the data.

5.5 PLS results
After ensuring that the data were valid, the proposed model was tested. Figure 4 shows the model
test results. Information overload has a positive significant impact on social media exhaustion
(β=0.36; p<0.001), and thus hypothesis H1 is supported. Social overload has a positive impact on
social media exhaustion (β=0.26; p<0.001), and thus hypothesis H2 is supported. System feature
overload does not have a positive impact on social media exhaustion, as the path value of the
result is not significant – thus hypothesis H3 is rejected. Social media exhaustion has a positive
impact on information avoidance (β=0.35; p<0.001), which supports hypothesis H4. Social
media exhaustion has a positive impact on discontinued usage (β=0.23; p<0.001), which supports
hypothesis H5. Information avoidance has no impact on discontinued usage; therefore,
hypothesis H6 is rejected.
Finally, among the control variables, age has a negative effect on discontinued use. This means
that younger people manage to discontinue their social media use more easily. Number of friends

27

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

also has a negative effect on discontinued use. This means that people who have more friends on
social media find it difficult to discontinue their use.

Note: (*: P< 0.05, **: P< 0.01, ***: P< 0.001)

In Figure 5 and Table 7, R2 values are shown. The predictors explained approximately 14%
variance of discontinued usage. The predictors of information avoidance explained
approximately 12% of the variance. Finally, the predictors explained 32% of social media
exhaustion.

The indirect effects of stress factors on the outcome factors were also checked. The results are
shown in Table 8. From this table, one can see that social media exhaustion mediated the
relationship between information overload and discontinued use (p<0.05). It also mediated the
relationship between information overload and information avoidance (p<0.01). Finally, it
mediated the relationship between social overload and information avoidance (p<0.05).

6. Discussions and implications
This chapter first discusses the main findings of this thesis, after which the theoretical and
practical implications of the findings are presented.

6.1 Main findings
The results showed that information overload had a significant effect on social media exhaustion.
Among the overload dimensions, the effect of information overload was the strongest. This
finding implies that an abundance of information on social media is the most important factor
creating social media exhaustion. This finding is in line with prior literature. For example,
Whelan et al. (2020) reported similar findings showing that information overload had a stronger
effect on social media fatigue than communication overload. In contrast to Whelan et al. (2020),
this thesis found that social overload also positively affects social media exhaustion.
It is interesting to observe that system feature overload had no significant effect on social media
exhaustion. This finding implies that users are very used to using social media platforms.
Therefore, the features are relatively easy to use. Karr-Wisniewski and Lu (2010) suggested
including system feature overload as a dimension of technology overload. Based on the results of
this thesis, system feature overload may not be an important dimension leading to social media
exhaustion in the context of social media use. However, this finding regarding the nonsignificant effect of system feature overload on social media exhaustion contradicts the recent
finding of Fu et al. (2020).
Social media exhaustion was found to have significant effects on both information avoidance and
discontinuation of use. These findings suggest that once users are exhausted with their use of
social media, they try to recover by avoiding information or even sometimes discontinuing their
32

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

use. Therefore, these findings are also in line with the recent work conducted by Osatuyi and
Turel (2020), who argued that people try to reduce their social media use as a self-regulatory
mechanism.
It is interesting to observe that the effect of information avoidance on discontinuation of social
media use was non-significant. This finding implies that people mainly discontinue their use of
social media because of strain (i.e., social media exhaustion), not because of information
avoidance.

6.2 Theoretical implications
This research can make five theoretical contributions.
First, the thesis used the SSO model to build a theoretical framework for understanding the
effects of social media overload on social media users. The thesis shows the efficacy of the SSO
model in providing an understanding of social media overload and its impact on discontinued
usage and information avoidance. Although past literature has used different models – for
example SOR, SOBC, post-adoptive model, stress dynamics, and coping theory – to establish the
link between social media overload and the discontinuation of its use, the thesis empirically
shows that the SSO model explains the social media overload situation elaborately and explains
human motives and behaviours (Davis et al., 1980).
Second, this study provides an understanding of social media exhaustion in terms of information
overload, social overload, and system feature overload. It should be noted that Fu et al. (2020)
also used these three predictors to explain social media exhaustion. They found that all three
overload-related factors had significant effects on social media exhaustion. In contrast to Fu et al.
(2020), this thesis found that system feature overload had a non-significant effect on social
media exhaustion.
Third, previous studies have ignored the factors that lead to information avoidance behaviour.
This thesis has developed a research model to analyse users’ information avoidance behaviour
33

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

based on social overload, information overload, system feature overload, and social media
exhaustion. This finding can benefit future research on social networking sites’ use and give
guidance to researchers in adding more constructs and testing them to discover the factors that
drive information avoidance behaviour of users.
Fourth, the study provides an understanding of discontinued usage behaviour of users of social
networking sites. Previous studies done on social media have interpreted the discontinuance
intention behaviour of users as the opposite of continued use (Zhang et al., 2016; Cao et al.,
2018). One study, by Zhang et al. (2016) indicated that more precise research is required to
understand discontinued usage behaviour. This thesis investigated and focused on the
discontinued usage intention of users (Maier et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016;
Chen et al., 2019) to fill the above research gap.
Fifth, the analysis shows that social media exhaustion has a positive impact on discontinuation of
usage and information avoidance. The relationship between social media exhaustion and
discontinuation of use has been identified by Fu et al. (2020). In this sense, the findings of this
thesis validate the findings of Fu et al. (2020). However, this thesis advances the study conducted
by Fu et al. (2020) by showing that social media exhaustion can also affect information
avoidance behaviour.

6.3 Practical Implications
The research findings provide guidelines for social networking site users, SNS managers, and
SNS marketers.
The findings of this thesis can inform users about the possible negative effects of social network
sites. They should keep in mind that when they use social networking sites, they might also
experience unwanted effects – meaning that they might get tired and exhausted, which could
create a negative attitude towards the use of SNSs. It could also lead to their avoidance of
information available on SNSs.

34

THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA OVERLOAD ON THE DISCONTINUATION OF ITS USE AND ON
INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

The results showed that information overload had the strongest effect on social media
exhaustion, and social media exhaustion might lead to discontinuation of social media usage and
to information avoidance. These findings have implications for marketers. Social media is a
powerful tool for marketers to display their products, and it has become a strategy for businesses
(Dwivedi et al., 2015). As marketers are using social media platforms for displaying products,
they should consider the possibility that excess information sharing on social networking sites
might create social media exhaustion, tiredness, and information overload for users. This might
demotivate them from using SNSs as well as cause them to avoid the marketers’ products. This
in turn might lead to a loss of paying customers. That is why marketers should control the wave
of information they post on social media.
Although millions use SNSs around the world, in recent years, we have also observed that many
people are showing discontinuance behaviours, and the avoidance of SNSs has been becoming
more common SNS managers should pay great attention to this issue because when users stop
using SNSs, that also leads to information avoidance behaviour. SNS managers could create a
system in which only a certain amount of information is given to the users. There could be a
filtering mechanism, which could help users avoid negative thoughts and social exhaustion due
to information and social overload. If there is a limit on information, then exhaustion and fatigue
will not affect users. It is also important for SNS managers to create good content for users,
which can add value for users and inspire them to use social networking sites in a moderate way.
SNS managers should try to understand the needs and requirements of the users so that all types
of people can benefit. Finally, all people are not the same, and there are some users who use
networking sites only for a short time. For them, the content should be simplified, and the SNS
managers should provide content that aligns with the interests and choices of people who are
using the platforms in specific ways.

7. Concluding remarks
In this section, the limitations of this study and future research directions will be discussed.
Then, the conclusion of my thesis will be presented.

7.1 Research limitations and future research
This thesis has several limitations. First, the data were specifically collected from Facebook, and
questionnaires were fully focused on Facebook. If the focus had been diversified to include other
social media networks, then the results could change and present a different picture. To address
this limitation, future research could be conducted to test the same model with different social
media networking sites – for example, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.
Second, future researchers can collect data from different cultural backgrounds to validate this
study’s results as well as to determine how results may vary among different cultures. In this
way, cultural background can be used as a moderator in the proposed framework of this thesis.
Third, the model was tested using a small sample size. Therefore, the findings of this thesis need
further validation using a larger sample size.
Fourth, specific age groups could be focused on to get more accurate results. In this thesis, data
were collected from all age groups, and analysis was done at aggregate levels. Future research
may conduct an analysis of how the results vary among different age groups.
Fifth, in the present study, the stressor-strain-outcomes model was used. To measure the
outcomes, two constructs – namely information avoidance and discontinuation of use – were
used. Apart from this, future researchers could add more constructs as outcomes. Specifically,
psychological outcomes could be measured for a more comprehensive understanding of social
media exhaustion of users.

INFORMATION AVOIDANCE

Sixth, there is a chance of bias in the self-reported data; therefore, for more clarity, a future study
should incorporate different research methodologies for collecting data to get a better overview
of the research outcomes.
Seventh, this study covered information overload, system feature overload, and social overload
of Facebook users and its impact on discontinuation of usage. However, the study did not
address communication overload, which could be investigated by researchers for further
investigation.
Finally, in this thesis, only social media exhaustion and information avoidance were employed as
predictors of discontinuation of use. Therefore, future researchers could make extensions to the
current model by adding more predictive variables for discontinued usage behaviour.

7.2 Conclusion
Social media is perhaps the most used platform to maintain communication among friends,
families, and acquaintances. Social media platforms are also used for information seeking and
for marketing products and services across the globe. Social media has positive impacts on users’
lives and businesses and can benefit users in various ways.
At the same time, giving too much time to social media may be detrimental to one’s well-being,
as shown in this thesis. In particular, this thesis focused on the relationships among the stress and
strain factors and how these strains may affect outcomes. The analysis results show that social
media increases social media exhaustion among users. The results also demonstrate that social
media exhaustion triggers discontinuation of usage as well as information avoidance.
The study has been used for a comprehensive understanding of social media usage and social
media exhaustion among users. The findings can help to improve the theory and can also benefit
policy makers, businesses, and practitioners. Also, the thesis will lay the groundwork for more
research to examine intentions of discontinuance and information avoidance.

Appendix B. Measurement items
Social media overload and its impact on discontinued usage
You are invited to participate in my survey on social media overload and its impact on
discontinued usage. In this survey, I would like to know your response about the impact of social
media (Facebook) and how users react to the excess information on social networking sites, for
example Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. Moreover, it is important to know how the
information adds value and demotivates users from stopping use of the networking sites.
I would be very happy if all of you just have 5 minutes to complete the survey questionnaires.
This study will be used for my thesis as a part of my MSc in Governance of Digitalization
program supervised by Professor Gunilla Widén at Åbo Akademi. Your participation in this
survey is voluntary, and there are no foreseeable risks associated with this survey. Data from this
research will be reported only in the aggregate and used for academic purposes.
If you have any questions at any time about the survey, you are welcome to send a query to me,
Nasreen Azad (nazad@abo.fi). Thanks for your valuable time and support.
