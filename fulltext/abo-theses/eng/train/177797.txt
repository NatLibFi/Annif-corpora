Title: Implementation of Microsoft Teams at big organizations’ in Finland
Supervisors: D.Sc. Anna Sell, Dr. Anssi Öörni
Abstract:
A digital workplace will seek constantly new digital tools that will assist the way of work
to become more agile, transparent and effective. Digital change needs to be well planned,
managed and executed. Change management is playing a big part in the implementation
of tools such as Microsoft Teams. Tools for digital communication might seem at a first
glimpse as a straightforward IT implementation. However, as a communications tool that
functions like an intranet, data repository and desktop combined into one hub, some
change management will be of good use.
The results in this thesis presents factors that companies in Finland can take into
consideration when implementing software such as Microsoft Teams. In the discussion
chapter an example of a suitable implementation path is presented. By using this template
in the process of implementing new software, companies can avoid making the same
mistakes as others have done before. The aim of this thesis, in the long run, is that
acceptance of new technology will be more pleasant and smooth for the end-user
(employee). This thesis also highlights the use of Microsoft Teams in Finnish
organizations’ point of view.

Key words:
Implementation of new digital technology, Software implementation, Change
management, Digital collaboration platform, Technology acceptance model (TAM),
Ease of use (EOU), Behavioral intentions, Microsoft Teams, Internal communications.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Companies worldwide are constantly trying to determine more efficient ways to work.
Internal communications and knowledge sharing are and have for a long time been the
only certain way to keep knowledge on a consistent level inside an organization. (Nonaka,
1991) Wrote in Harvard Business Review almost three decades ago about the ‘knowledgecreating’ company, the same facts still exist, but the knowledge is spreading over the
internet in a matter of milliseconds and therefore, also competition is becoming more
intense day by day.
Software plays a huge role in what we can accomplish since it functions as the main tools
in the digital workplace. A digital workplace is, according to Gartner, something that
‘enables new, more effective ways of working; raises employee engagement and agility;
and exploits consumer-oriented styles and technologies.’ (Gartner, 2020). Companies in
Finland as well as the rest of the world strive to find the digital tools that enable them to
complete their work in a more efficient way. ‘Digitalization is the race to be on the top of
the digital wave year after year, in order to stay competitive.’ (Collin et al., 2015).
For any company to stay competitive amongst rivals in the same industry, new technology
must be continuously implemented (Yang and Meyer, 2015). Decisions against using the
newest technology accessible today could result in the same kinds of missed opportunities
as many companies faced, when deciding against utilizing the internet once it came along.
The future is inevitable and different future events determine what kind of decisions today
turn out to be the most valuable when looking back a few years from now. All that a
company can do for the future, is to keep constantly looking for new technological
solutions to support our core businesses.

Study conducted by Ravichandran, T & Lertwongsatien. C suggests:
‘ organizations that have failed to systematically develop IS functional capabilities or
invest in the acquisition of IS resources could find themselves lacking the necessary
capacity to leverage IT in the creation and sustenance of competitive positions.’
(Ravichandran and Lertwongsatien, 2005)

1.2 Outline

This study will focus on the usage of Microsoft Teams software as a solution for internal
collaboration and communications. In order to specify the research area, companies with
employees in Finland will be in focus. The study will be aimed at mapping what exactly
companies in Finland have done in terms of preparation, execution and follow-up on the
implementation of Microsoft Teams. The study is conducted with a mix of qualitative and
quantitative data to discover gaps in the assistance of user adaption of Microsoft Teams
at companies in Finland.

1.3 Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) is the main communication software for Office365
Business clients, it enables users to chat, arrange meetings, share and work on documents,
audio and video calls with the option of screen-sharing, etc. In addition, Microsoft Teams
does offer a variety of plugin apps that migrate MS Teams to other software. Since MS
Teams was launched in 2017 Microsoft has been referring to it as ‘the hub for teamwork’
in Microsoft O365.
On July 30th Microsoft announced that Skype for business will be retired on July 31st,
2021 (Skay, 2019). Many businesses are therefore, facing a natural shift from using
Microsoft Skype for Business (SfB) towards using Microsoft Teams. Microsoft has
integrated Microsoft Teams as a part of their Business Office 365 license plans: Business

Otto Vauhkonen
Essentials, Business Premium, Enterprise E1, E3, or E5 and Enterprise E4 (for anyone
who purchased it prior to its retirement) (Microsoft, 2020).

Figure 1 Microsoft Teams Numbers (Microsoft Ignite 2019)
Microsoft teams works primarily without download on an internet browser via the URL
teams.microsoft.com. For a full range of features and a better user experience Microsoft
Teams is available to download on desktop platforms Windows, Linux and macOS As
well as on mobile platforms iOS and Android (Microsoft, 2020).

1.4 Motivation

For professionals who have graduated with Information Systems as major subject a rather
high percentage are working as some form of consultancy (Helsingin yliopiston koulutusja kehittämispalvelut, 2019). Any student majoring in Information Systems could
probably see themselves working within consultancy following their graduation.
There are multiple interests in remote work such as communications between offices,
communication between merchant and supplier and communication between on-shore and
off-shore locations. Remote work reduces the amount of traveling which in turn reduces
emissions and company carbon footprint that has become a popular topic during the last
8

Otto Vauhkonen
decade. The employee work-life-balance is an interest for the employee standpoint.
Parents in Finland with small children might need to stay home in a case where the child
is ill. Working remotely from home gives the company close to the same value nowadays
that computers are thin laptops and all data is accessible over the web.
Implementation of new Information Systems (IS) at a workplace might cause some change
resistance. Microsoft products have at some level lacked supporters within the tech
community. Will MS Teams be a tool used at companies to spark new ways to work? How
have companies in Finland managed to implement MS Teams in their day-to-day work?
Furthermore, what can we learn from these cases when implementing Teams to be used
as the first chosen tool for internal communications across a whole organization or to
replace an existing tool - in the future?

1.5 Problem

Companies are implementing Microsoft Teams as a tool for more efficient and transparent
co-working. The reason behind the motive to implement teams may vary depending on
the company. The first initiative to complete an implementation might come from the
company lead, communications department, HR, IT, or an IT-Partner (Microsoft itself or
a third-party IT-partner). Companies that decide to implement Microsoft Teams are often
already using Skype for Business (SfB) and are therefore, sooner or later going to be
forced to switch from SfB to Teams due to Microsoft’s decision to stop updating SfB from
June 2021 (Skay, 2019).
Internal communications tools are digital tools that might be perceived ease of use
compared to more technical software. Microsoft Teams offers a whole new way of
working in groups, it requires some bottom-rules and a so-called playbook with common
rules and guidelines on how to use the software and for what purpose. Implementing
Teams at a large company can be quite a long process. An implementation of this sort will
be an ongoing project with strong involvement from the whole organization. Important to
know, is that implementing Microsoft Teams is not as easy as just launching a new
9

Otto Vauhkonen
technology for the employees to use. For a company to benefit from using Microsoft
Teams, all employees must be involved and given the opportunity to take the time to adopt
the software. External help in the form of consultants within communication and change
management are strongly suggested. In global companies, there is also the question of
different cultures and languages which might cause some extra work with the translation
of guidelines and help-sections. Microsoft Teams is being implemented in as many ways
as there are companies implementing it. Figure 2 Personal discussions with professionals
(Nov. 2019-Feb. 2020).
The purpose of this thesis is to find out where Finnish organizations’ stand in their
implementation of Microsoft Teams. Furthermore, to highlight the possible do’s and
don’ts and paint a picture of how an implementation project could look like, what are
things to consider and what are the things that should be focused on prior to and during
the implementation.

1.6 Research questions
1. What are the reasons and aimed benefit of using Microsoft Teams?
2. How the can success of a Microsoft Teams implementation be measured?
How has the implementation of Microsoft Teams resulted in Finnish companies
according to these metrics?
3. What are the suggested steps in a Microsoft Teams implementation project?
Can we name any keys to success? What type of education assists the end-user?

2. Research methodology
In this chapter the research methods are presented and motivated. In addition, the
collected data and the interviewed professionals are presented.

10

Otto Vauhkonen
2.1 Literature analysis
Qualitative and quantitative research are commonly used methods for research.
Combining parts of the two types of research is done in all behavioral research (Newman
and Ridenour, 1998)
Data collection methods, such as observation, interviews, open-response questionnaire
items, verbal reports, diaries, and discourse analysis are all forms of qualitative research
(Croker, 2009). Qualitative research is often conducted in a face to face meeting.
However, it can also be held via phone (Eriksson and Kovalainen 2008). In this study the
data collection method of choice will be qualitative open interviews. The set of interviews
is going to be held via phone call or Microsoft Teams video-call. The interviews work as
a knowledge ground for creating questionnaires aimed for professionals working with
implementing Microsoft Teams. The set of personal discussions are qualitative data that
are presented in chapters 5–7.
Quantitative research is based on numbers and statistical methods. The methods seek
measurements and analyses that can be replicated by other researchers. (King, Keohane
and Verba, 1994). One main form of quantitative method that will be used in this study is
surveying. ‘Surveying is a research method used to get information about certain groups
of people representative of some larger group of interest’ (Berger, 2018).
For the literature review a selection of adaption models will be reviewed. The selected
models include Kotter’s Eight steps to transform your organization, Prosci: ADKAR
model, Technology Adoption Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Theory of Planned
Behavior, Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Acceptance Model,
Technology Acceptance Model 2, Technology Acceptance Model 3 and the
Motivational Model. Knowledge sharing and learning within an organization will be
investigated in order to build an understanding of the value in collaborative working.
The potential benefits of using Microsoft Teams will be investigated. Some basic
functions that Teams include will be investigated those include; the process of localizing

11

files, working collaboratively in real-time, version history control, transparency and
internal communications, the project champion, and SaaS security.
2.2 Open personal discussions
In order to form a good understanding of Microsoft Teams implementation projects a list
of professionals will be invited for an interview. This group of professionals consists of i.
Implementation project owners / internal team members of implementing companies, ii.
Microsoft personnel – Advisory position for helping large scale companies in
implementing Microsoft products and iii. Third-party consultants, that are specializing in
consulting within the implementation of Microsoft products.

Measuring success can be a tricky part of the implementation of Microsoft Teams. In order
to gain a better understanding and having a concrete example from a Finnish organization,
a large organization (+25 000 employees) agreed to share their implementation data with
the agreement of keeping the organization non-disclosed. These data can be utilized as
part of this thesis in order to form a better guide for other organizations to follow and
thereby succeed in their implementation of Microsoft Teams or similar information
systems.

2.4 Questionnaires

As the qualitative part of this thesis, some basic questionnaires are used to measure
opinions and assumptions that there are around the implementation, adaption, and use of
Microsoft Teams as a tool for internal communication. Appendixes to these surveys can
be found in chapter 17 of this document.

3. Theory and literature review
3.1 Change Management Models
3.1.1

Kotter’s Eight steps to transform your organization

Kotter’s model for change management is a linear step-by-step model for successful
organizational change. These steps are presented in Table 1 Eight steps to transform your
organization (Kotter, 1995).
1. Establishing a Sense of Urgency
Examining market and competitive realities
Identifying and discussing crises, potential crises, or major opportunities
2. Forming a Powerful Guiding Coalition
Assembling a group with enough power to lead the change effort Encouraging the
group to work together as a team
3. Creating a Vision
Creating a vision to help direct the change effort Developing strategies for achieving
that vision
4. Communicating the Vision
Using every vehicle possible to communicate the new vision and strategies Teaching
new behaviors by the example of the guiding coalition
5. Empowering Others to Act on the Vision
Getting rid of obstacles to change
Changing systems or structures that seriously undermine the vision Encouraging risktaking and nontraditional ideas, activities and actions
6. Planning for and Creating Short-Term Wins
Planning for visible performance improvements Creating those improvements
Recognizing and rewarding employees involved in the improvements
7. Consolidating Improvements and Producing Still More Change
Using increased credibility to change systems, structures and policies that don’t fit the
vision Hiring, promoting and developing employees who can implement the vision
Reinvigorating the process with new projects, themes and change agents
8.Institutionalizing New Approaches
Articulating the connections between the new behaviors and corporate success
Developing the means to ensure leadership development and succession

3.1.2

Prosci: ADKAR

Prosci’s ADKAR model is an acronym that consists of the words Awareness, Desire,
Knowledge, Ability and Reinforcement
Awareness
Awareness is the first step of the implementation where the task is to sort out the business
need. In this stage employees are made aware of the current situation and the needs and
wants of change in the organization. Awareness will have resistance at first but by making
constant efforts towards the awareness of the need for change the resistance will decrease.
Desire
The second step in ADKAR is Desire, once the awareness is tackled the desire to use the
IS is required. The step is done during concept & design phase, ‘The employee’s personal
motivators or barriers contribute to their level of desire to use the new software’ (Prosci
inc.)
Knowledge
The third step is sharing the knowledge on how to change. Once the awareness and desire
are built sharing detailed knowledge can begin. If the employees are sent to training
without awareness or desire the training will lack effect for the adoption. Knowledge
includes instructions on how to use the IS. Knowledge step will be done during the
implementation phase.
Ability
Once the knowledge is in place the ability can be mastered. Where knowledge is about
navigating and learning the buttons, pages and folders for use of the IS, the ability is
knowhow in being able to put things into action. Ability step will be done during the
implementation phase just as knowledge.
Reinforcement
15

Otto Vauhkonen
Once the employees have all the previous steps under control iteration of the use-cases
and features can begin. Reinforcement is all about finding new ways to utilize the tool and
reinforcing the users by following the user groups utilization of the IS. By sharing user
stories and use cases and educating employees in functions the knowledge towards the IS
will grow. Knowledge work will be done after the implementation, in the
postimplementation phase which is supposed to be ongoing until the end of the use for the
IS.

3.2 Technology Adoption Models
User-friendly software ‘User-friendliness’ is what you can hear people talk about when
they refer to a programs ability to be used from a level of no prior experience of system
use. The user-friendliness of an information system or software in academic research is
often measured by a model for adoption or acceptance. Adoption models are models that
describe the users’ path from point A to point B, where point A is a state of use that is
minimal or close to non-existent towards a new technology and point B is the state where
the new technology is part of everyday habits (often at work environments). The
Technology adaption has for long been studied at workplaces purely for the interest of
employers to make their company employees work more effectively. Today, technology
is surrounding us wherever we go since it is packed in mobile devices, the self-service
point of sales is becoming more common and online reservations/ orderings and purchases
are used more frequently. Taherdoost & Masrom examined smart card technology
acceptance using the adoption model. In their article, they have defined the variations in
different acceptance models.

Figure 4 An overview of Adoption / Acceptance Models (Taherdoost, 2018)

In addition to variables seen in Figure 5, computer playfulness shows an effect on
perceived ease of use according to the study (Hackbarth, Grover and Yi, 2003).

Figure 5 Adoption model (Taherdoost and Masrom, 2009) Is mapping out factors that
bring satisfaction and external variables that affect the end user attitude towards the use
and adoption of new technology. Each variable is also defined and backed up by previous
research.

Models for measuring the adoption or acceptance of an IS are numerous, one of the most
notorious models is called the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM has had
various versions and in the following chapters will attempt to explain the evolvement of
the model. The reason this thesis will focus on TAM instead of other similar models, such
as the theory of reasoned action (TRA) or the theory of planned behavior (TPB), is that
TAM shows better performance according to previous studies (Venkatesh et al., 2003).
Just as any other model, also the original version of TAM has become outdated for use in
modern-day organizational implementation projects. Therefore, the new version of TAM
will be in focus and the differences of the models will be discussed in chapter 3.3.
3.2.1

Theory of Reasoned Action

Figure 6 Theory of Reasoned Action
The theory of reasoned action (TRA) by Dr. Martin Fishbein and later revised and
expanded by Ajzen and Fishbein describes a person’s intention to behave in a certain way
where the intention is a decision or ‘attitude’ that is in focus when investigating the path
towards the outcome. Furthermore, the theory gives weight to the variable ‘subjective
norms’ which represents the impact of influential groups on the intention (desire). The
sum of ‘Norm’ and ‘Attitude’ forms the intention which strongly determines future
behavior (Fishbein 1967; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975)

3.2.2

Theory of Planned Behavior

The theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) describes the correlation between
beliefs and behaviors and was made to improve TRA. Perceived behavioral
control is the added variable which takes into account the person’s perception of the
behavior being easy or difficult.

Figure 7 Theory of Planned Behavior

3.2.3

Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior

The model for the decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) has been criticized as
a rather complex model compared to the other competing models. According to Taylor &
Todd (1995), if the goal is to predict IT usage, then TAM should be the model of choice.
The decomposed TPB provides a deeper understanding of usage intention and behavior
than the original TAM, thus, it will help management understand the reason behind user
intentions. (Taylor and Todd, 1995) DTPB is more complex than the original TAM and
will, therefore, require more precise work and understanding from the implementation
management team. Compared to TPB, DTPB takes into consideration variables behind
attitude towards behavior (PU, PEU, Compatibility), variables behind subjective norm
(Peer Influence, Superior’s Influence) and variables behind perceived behavioral control
(Self-efficacy, Resource Facilitating Conditions, Technology Facilitating Conditions).

3.2.4

3.1.4 Technology Acceptance Model

Figure 8 The Technology Acceptance Model, version 1. (Davis, et. al., 1989)
20

Otto Vauhkonen
The technology acceptance model (TAM) describes how the user accepts new technology
in use. TAM is based on the theoretical model of human behavior from psychology, the
Theory of Reasoned Action by Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975 (Davis, 1986). The core
framework is simple: User experiences (UX) stimulus from discovering System Features
& Capabilities – Inner Motivation towards using the system is building up – Resulting in
actual use of the system and interest to find more use cases for the system (Davis, 1986).
User-friendliness is important in all technology but essential in technology that is
unknown to the user. Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw (1989) have studied technology
acceptance consisting of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), theory
of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behavior (TPB). The earlier study shows
how PU and PEU are the roots of users’ attitudes (A) towards a new technology and that
attitudes, in their turn, are the spark for motivation and excitement towards using the
technology. TAM has been modified several times since and the most cited work would
be (Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1989)
3.2.5

Technology Acceptance Model 2

TAM 2 extends the original technology acceptance model by specifying the following
eternal variables: Experience (process that comes with time) subjective norm,
voluntariness and image (social influence processes) and job relevance, output quality,
result demonstrability (cognitive instrumental processes) (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000).
Study found that social influence has a significant effect on user preservation of new
technology and that once users gained experience the impact of social influence had less
influence. (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)

21

Otto Vauhkonen

Figure 9 Technology Acceptance Model 2 (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000)

3.2.6

Technology Acceptance Model 3

The TAM 3 is suggested as a continuation of the previous models. Potential pre- and
postimplementation interventions are added as variables that can enhance employees’
adoption and use of IT. Variables are presented in Figure 10 Technology Acceptance
Model 3 (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008) These new variables are computer self-efficacy,
perceptions of external control, computer anxiety, computer playfulness (preimplementational)

and

perceived

enjoyment

and

objective

usability

(post-

implementational). (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)

22

Figure 10 Technology Acceptance Model 3 (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008)

3.2.7

Motivational Model

The motivational model (MM) aims to predict behavioral intention (BI). The model based
on the hypothesis that the behavior of an individual is based on extrinsic and intrinsic
motivations. Extrinsic motivations are found outside the person that is completing the task
or outside the task that is being done. An example of extrinsic motivation is salary or
reward. Intrinsic motivations on the other hand is the motivation that is formed by inner
drive or passion and has an end goal of feeling pleasure or satisfaction. (Bagozzi, Davis
and Warshaw, 1992) Intrinsic motivation could be the use of a photo editing tool in order

23

Otto Vauhkonen
to be able to create a nice-looking deck of slides at work to strive for admiration and praise
from colleges.
3.3 Summary of the literature review
Prosci: ADKAR model is in versatile use of Microsoft professionals today. (Open
personal discussion with Microsoft Professionals). The model is specifically designed for
digital transformation projects and is therefore applicable for use in Microsoft Teams
implementations. ADKAR model outlines the adaption path with a single employee in
focus. ADKAR model is clear and easy to use and needs no complex setup that would
vary depending on your organization. ADKAR is a good tool for planning,
implementation and follow-up. The better an implementation is planned the better it will
succeed, therefore, ADKAR should be brought to attention already in the planning phase
of an implementation. If the implementation has already proceeded ADKAR can still
provide some insight on the needed course of action.
Kotter’s Eight steps to transform your organization is a rather old model for organizational
change to be used in the year 2020. Models created half a century ago are seldomly the
best applicable ones. Organizations’ today are far from the same they were back then.
Employees are treated better and management has become more instructional than
authoritative. According to professionals most of change management models have
similarities to Kotter’s models (5 Open personal discussion with Microsoft Professionals).
Thus, Kotter’s Eight steps to transform your organization can be considerable read prior
to a Microsoft Teams implementation project.
The original TAM has some inadequacy regarding modern-day organizational
implementation projects; as Venkatesh and Bala wrote themselves, ‘ITs are becoming
increasingly complex’ (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008). Compared to 1999, the year 2019 was
different. In the year 2019, the world total number of internet users equated to over half
of the world population (Miniwatts Marketing Group, 2020). The end-user is more aware
of the variety of information systems to choose from than before. The number of
companies developing new IS is also skyrocketing. Jay McBain, Principal Analyst at
24

Otto Vauhkonen
Forrester, wrote in 2017 the following: “I estimate there are more than 100,000 software
companies (ISVs) today around the world — up from 10,000 only 10 years ago. I wouldn’t
be surprised, with the level of hyper specialization new buyers are demanding, to see that
number grow to 1 million by 2027.” (McBain, 2017).
Adoption models will have to change accordingly to the users becoming more oriented in
the use of new technology. The emerging technology will also have an impact on user
adoption, as different forms of technology take different amounts of time and internal
motivation in users before they breakthrough. Video features have come long, but for
instance VUIs are still going to need a more mature level of translation before they can
break through in countries where English is a foreign language. Furthermore, 3D and VR
are technologies that have variables that need future investigation for acceptance models
to be able to measure these technologies. Observing the advice that this literature is
suggesting and reflecting it for the use of an implementation project concerning Microsoft
Teams at workplaces in Finland the variables: motivation, acceptance, perceived ease of
use, perceived usefulness, compatibility, awareness, support, anxiety, security, image,
social influence, triability, visibility, voluntariness and demographic will all be applied
for use. Thus, the above models and literature will bring value to this study.

4. Microsoft Teams for an organization
4.1 Knowledge sharing and learning within an organization
Rodgers and Freiberg 1969 wrote that the socially most valuable set of learning is
learning how to learn new things. If you teach yourself first how to learn new skills or
broaden your knowledge, then you will be able to learn faster. (Rogers and Freiberg,
1969) Learning how to read faster makes you faster at reading books, hence you will be
able to read more books during your lifetime.
Knowledge sharing within an organization works the same way. By teaching how to
share practical use cases to employees, there will be more shared use cases. More shared
25

Otto Vauhkonen
knowledge will result in a higher level of average expertise per employee in the
organization. A higher level of organizational knowledge will result in higher
effectiveness (Nonaka, 1991).
According to research employee perceptions of a high level of organizational learning
culture has a positive effect on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. (Hsu,
2009) By securing employees via commitment, the company will also save on expenses.
Employee turnover equals higher expenses in employee onboardings and education. In
companies that develop new products and services in highly competitive markets loss of
skilled employees might cause so-called knowledge leakage, where the former employee
moves to work for a competitor and leak of knowledge happens. (Frishammar, Ericsson
and Patel, 2015)
Different people learn in different ways, therefore, there will not be one way of teaching
that will help all employees within an organization to reach a specific level all within the
same amount of time. In order to make sure that all employees reach a desired level of
expertise there must be multiple ways that assist these employees on the way.

4.2 Potential benefits of using Microsoft Teams
4.2.1

Localizing files

Teams should then provide better access to your files. Microsoft advertise Microsoft
Teams on their website by the following: ‘Microsoft Teams uses powerful, integrated
search capabilities and built-in access to SharePoint, OneNote and Planner, so team
members can find what they’re looking for—instantly.’ (Microsoft 365 Team, 2019)
4.2.2

Collaborative real-time work

Once you have Microsoft Office 365 in use for your organization, you can choose to either
create, edit and save files locally on your computer hard drive or on cloud server space as
advised by Microsoft. The benefit of having files stored in the cloud is that they are easily
available from anywhere by the employees via login using company username and
26

Otto Vauhkonen
password. Files can then be accessed by employees assigned to these specific folders
containing documents. Each team working with documents can share files in their
collaborative folders. By working collaboratively on documents, work becomes more
efficient and transparent. ‘Microsoft Teams is primarily a tool for connecting people and
their daily tasks in a collaborative and transparent hub.’ (Microsoft 365 Team, 2019)
4.2.3

Version history control

To continue on the previous section (4.2.2) working collaboratively and autosaving to the
cloud server space reduces the chance of file misplacements or unsaved documents as well
as keeps track of edits & version history being provided to all authors of the shared
document. ‘Because every document shared in Microsoft Teams is saved to the cloud,
team members work from the latest version—no searching.’ (Microsoft 365 Team, 2019)

4.2.4

Transparency and internal communications

A survey conducted in 2004 by the corporate leadership council spoke for internal
communications and its relevance for employee engagement. An ROI on software for
communications might be impossible to count on existing user metrics, but as it empowers
internal communications and transparency within the organization it definitely does good
for motivating the employee to not only stay at the current employment, but also perform
well in her current position. (The Corporate Leadership Council, 2004)
By perceived low anxiety and high playfulness towards the IS a user will be motivated to
use the IS in a more efficient way and to learn to master the use faster. Providing the
employee with a new technology that is metrics of PEU will result in a more cost-effective
implementation. (Hackbarth, Grover and Yi, 2003)
4.3 The Project Champion
One thing that Microsoft is underlining on its website in the section of tips for Teams
implementation, is a so-called champions network. (Microsoft, 2018) A Project Champion
is a person that drives change in the organization and helps the personnel to reach the goal
set for the project scope. (Pinto and Slevin, 1989) More regarding pilot champions in
chapter 11 Microsoft Teams implementation phases.

4.4 SaaS security
Software as a service (SaaS) is the form of software subscriptions provided as cloud
software licenses rather than regular desktop software. SaaS solutions enable both faster
installs and solves the problem with on-premise server space. SaaS is also perceived as a
data secure option since the servers are in data centers at nondisclosed remote locations.
Cloud computing services are data availability and data security outsourced.
(Balachandra, Ramakrishna and Rakshit, 2009) Cloud solution security is from an
organization’s perspective is as secure as a Single Sign-On (SSO) can be. Reported
security

issues

in

Microsoft

O365

(Snow,

2017)

When migrating to cloud security concerns worth checking are outdated software, thirdparty enterprise security protocols (ESP) as well as the cloud vendors and cloud
applications that you plan to utilize. Risk of data loss can happen in case of files being
compromised

through

ransomware

or

deleted

by

human

error.

Microsoft is constantly looking for ways to enhance their cloud security. Microsoft has
incorporated cloud-based anti-malware protection into the basic design of Office 365. The
malware protection detects suspicious files and links and deletes files that might cause
harm. The ongoing work for finding ways to improve cloud-based anti-malware protection
is keeping your organization’s employee Office 365 accounts in a safer state than
traditional anti-malware protection. The malware is never going to reach the device if it is
stopped prior to it being uploaded to the cloud. In an organization where files are
constantly shared amongst colleges this is extremely important. (Arrott, Macalintal and
McMillan, 2017)

5. Open personal discussion with Microsoft
Professionals
5.1 Antti Kiviniemi
During an interview conducted on January 8, 2020, Antti Kiviniemi, Customer Program
Manager at Microsoft, stated that Teams is a tool for enabling co-operation in an
organization. Teams is the community hub that provides tools for sharing knowledge,
assisting co-workers and collaborating on tasks that have multiple stakeholders. By having
the documents and conversations online and available to all assigned parties, transparency
is added, and unnecessary bottlenecks are removed. Future will show what all features can
be added, but for instance real-time subtitles in a videoconference will certainly allow us
to collaborate better across cultural and geographical borders. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer
Program

Manager

at

Microsoft, personal

communication,

January

8,

2020).

Teams is a secure platform and Microsoft as a company has extremely good resources to
maintain the safety of the service. The whole safety-related picture is thought precisely
through from data safety to physical safety. Microsoft datacenters are ISO2000 certified
and security is constantly being tested by both internal personnel and third-party security
partners. Typical testing can be a red team vs blue team where the one tries to find
vulnerabilities and the other tries to stop the attacks (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program
Manager

at

Microsoft, personal

communication,

January

8,

2020).

Microsoft fast track is a place with good information on how to start using Microsoft
products. When the wish is to move data from an existing repository, on-premise or cloud,
the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of Microsoft Office 365 cloud are open
for importing and exporting data. Kiviniemi underlined the importance of every
organization’s need to create an exit plan for moving their data in order to prepare the
move, if needed. Microsoft does not want to force any customers to stay on their platform.
29

Otto Vauhkonen
If the need to move from Microsoft cloud would emerge at some point, then Microsoft
APIs will be still open for migrating out from the cloud to another platform provider. (A.
Kiviniemi, Customer Program Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January
8, 2020).
Microsoft fast track is a good source for learning and educational material also for
employees. The video material is only (for now at least) available in English and the
automated translation is not possible due to the complexity of the Finnish language.
Materials should be shared, but no organization should ever rely on online material alone.
Kiviniemi mentioned a so-called champions program as an excellent way to implement
Teams as a tool for organization-wide collaboration. A champions program usually
includes a few employees with interest and drive to push the organization’s way to work
towards the next level. Champions could be selected for each team or division of the
organization. Champions would receive training in the use of teams until they would be
on a good enough level to feel confident to teach others and help with questions regarding
use. Organizational differences are big, each organization has its own way of educating
personnel. Online instructions should be short and efficient. Help or tips buttons can be
added to Teams that can be linked to an intra or Yammer page where good instructions
and use cases can be gathered. Start from basics and then move to more complex material.
Teams can be used to teach its users by adding a bot that gives hints on new features.
According to Kiviniemi’s experience, the attendance or focus on educational events is
higher if the workshop is in a physical location than online.
A champions program is something that shall be taken into use since it makes peer-to-peer
education multiply. Kiviniemi underlined that good things to use in Teams are a button
for learning pathways and a tips bot that reminds the user of features.
Piloting the implementation of Teams is a good idea for an organization. All
organizations’ have their own specific tasks that will have to be tailored to function around
Teams and Share Point. Piloting help sections, network connections and hardware is

30

Otto Vauhkonen
essential preparation for a successful implementation. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program
Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
In the future, for example alarms can be filtered with the help of AI implemented to teams
via out-of-the-box , third-party applications. Teams will be used as a display layer or
dashboard where different applications can be forwarded. Applications can be made on
top of the Azure cloud and then displayed in Teams. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program
Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
What affects the end-user adoption is influence from the closest superior at the workplace.
Supporting the users with concrete use cases for individual needs is one of the best tools
for motivating end-user. Microsoft Service Adoption Specialist course is a good read for
anyone involved in an implementation project, in the free course Teams is used as an
example of a software to be implemented. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program Manager at
Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020). Course can be found at
https://www.edx.org/course/microsoft-service-adoption-specialist-2

.

Having a sponsor from a high enough level of the organization makes a big difference.
The sponsor works as an inspirational or influential leader and communication of the
change/ implementation can be published via this sponsor. A sponsor is the public face
towards the organization and gives credibility to the change project. The sponsor does not
have to oversee the implementation but is used as an influential leader. (A. Kiviniemi,
Customer Program Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020)
With a so-called soft launch, professionals refer to an IT- implementation where the
software is pushed out across all organizations in a way that it all works, but the software
is not introduced via campaigns or other communications. Workshops or other forms of
education is neither done in soft launches. Kivimäki states that he has seen a few
implementations where the organization has been able to grow the use of Teams up to a
certain level, but that much higher percentage of users are able to adapt to the use of Teams
by implementing it as a change management project. In soft launch cases, end users are
31

Otto Vauhkonen
often confused by how the tool should be used and are having trouble coming to an
agreement. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program Manager at Microsoft, personal
communication, January 8, 2020)
Regarding hardware, the network is the most critical component. Teams is moving realtime media and especially the real-time video. If the organization’s internal network fails
to carry the traffic of video communication during the first attempts to use Teams, then
also the first user experience will be ruined, which in turn dilutes the image of Teams and
its capability to work as a tool for internal communications. Having OS client and drivers
up to date is important prior to implementing Teams due to security and compliance of
audio and video settings to function properly. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program Manager
at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020)
In terms of metrics for measuring the success of the implementation, usage reports can
obviously be utilized to show results. In an implementation project for Microsoft Teams,
the desired end goals will be depending on the organization, for instance, it could be to
strive for increased communality, the number of meetings, conversations in chat, whether
if email attachments have decreased and uploaded files in Teams have increased and so
on. Qualitative metrics are just as important as numeric quantitative metrics, asking
questions that indicate employee inclusiveness of the team or the employee perception on
internal communication are good qualitative measurements. Historical data is important
in order to measure the effect of Teams at improving efficiency at the organization.
Quality can easily be measured as well as the overall satisfaction of the software.
Interviewing the teams that have managed to utilize Teams at a high rate in their daytoday work helps understanding how the adoption can be made easier for others. Choosing
out concrete use cases from teamwork in Teams and sharing those practices will help
others adopt as well. (A. Kiviniemi, Customer Program Manager at Microsoft, personal
communication, January 8, 2020)

5.2 Kati Viita 11.12.2019

In Finland O365 has been used in many organizations for 1-2 years already prior to Teams
roll-out. In these cases, Teams is often implemented with the aim to replace Lync or SfB,
this alone does not bring much-added value. Teams has the potential to be so much more
and revolutionize the way of working. Often planning is done by IT and management
leads in organizations’, communications and HR must be involved in the implementation
planning as well. Teams is a factor for work-wellbeing and important tool for internal
communications for the organization. The technical part is small compared to the change
management part of it. ‘Utilization grade of Teams at my customers is somewhere
between 5-85% depending on the organization. At some customer companies the adoption
of teams has not even fully covered the communications department’. (K. Viita, Senior
Customer Success Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
Implementation projects cannot be successful without the support from the lead. Microsoft
Teams is a tool for end-users and brings new ways of working. IT-personnel in
organizations are having a hard time realizing the need for involving management in the
implementation of an IS that “replaces Skype”. Therefore, implementation projects of
Microsoft Teams should always be joint operations between HR, Communications, Upper
Management and IT. Digitalization brings a need for change in ways of working, some
organizations’ have already realized it. (K. Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager at
Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
Educating use for Teams is vital for gaining the full potential from the software. Without
proper education of the use cases the image of the tool might be distorted. In one
organization some department could end up using teams purely as a repository whereas
some other department uses it as a tool for meetings and calls only. Help section in Teams
is a good first tool, live video education and short videos in a library is good to have.
Education requires professional knowledge and experience; the education is strongly
adviced to be outsourced to a professional. (K. Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager
at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
33

Otto Vauhkonen

Organizational departments might have variations in readiness to adapt to new technology.
Prosci’s change management methodology is commonly used by Microsoft professionals,
it focuses on how change is made on an individual level. Ability to adapt to change
depends on the organization and the individual. Most change management models have
similarities with Kotter’s models. (K. Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager at
Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
Champions network is a selection of employees that are on a mission to drive new ways
of work. The champion network is a train the trainers’ type of knowledge sharing chain.
Leadership is needed in a champions network and that part is often outsourced for
consultants with proficiency in Teams and 0365-products. Champions network is a group
of people that has as much diversity as possible within the organization. Often people that
apply are already superusers (use Teams a lot) or early adopters that want to be part of a
cool group that has meetups and extra training. The champions get the value from the
acknowledgment that the Teams sponsors, and higher management involved gives to these
evangelists. Teaching a diverse group of the employees, a wide variety of use cases
suitable for different positions within the organization. Resistance of use will pretty much
in all cases be at least 5% of employees. Even in companies with purely office-workers
the user rates of Teams have been reaching only 85%. The motivation for the individual
as Prosci’s change management methodology explains, must be made as easy for the
employee as possible. (K. Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager at Microsoft, personal
communication, January 8, 2020).
Playbooks must be done by a team that knows the organization’s internal needs; it cannot
be 100% bought from an external consultant. The playbook must be made as a project and
the sponsor must be involved as a decisionmaker that can make the decisions. Playbook
will contain use-cases that solve problems and guide the user in the adaption of Teams.
The playbook can be done collaboratively with the champion network. (K. Viita, Senior
Customer Success Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).

34

Otto Vauhkonen
Implementation of Microsoft Teams can be measured in various ways, a list of example
measurements is presented in Figure 11 Metrics in Teams (Microsoft). Commitment to
the employment is valuable for organizations’, intent to stay and appreciation towards the
employment have been increased at customers with factory line workers when supplying
employees with Teams for communications. In jobs where communicating in person is
restricted due to the line of work or information is shared only in print-media, any
communication that is provided will add perceived satisfaction for the employment. (K.
Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager at Microsoft, personal communication, January
8, 2020).
In the future Teams will be more like an operating system desktop view than an online
chat or place for video-meetings. ‘At the moment third-party software is rarely used, since
teams is a new tool in many companies. I would guess only 2-3% of users are already
using third-party applications via Teams’ (K. Viita, Senior Customer Success Manager at
Microsoft, personal communication, January 8, 2020).

5.3 (Harri Mikkanen 19 Dec. 2019

Teams will bring clear use for collaboration tools with a small amount of effort. Teams is
a hub for collaboration that reduces the need to switch between multiple software during
work tasks. Teams is implemented for a variety of reasons; usual ones are i.
communications in groups and ii. sharing documents. The most used added applications
on top of Teams are Microsoft Planner and Microsoft Power BI. The planning of tools
that suit the specific organization is important and a rule of thumb would be to have more
users than channels. And organizing the tabs in the channels to be uniform. Using video
features and recording meetings are basic procedures that should be used more. In a digital
world like today we have all calendars packed with meetings and events, the possibility
to watch a post-production/recap of an event or meeting adds visibility and ensures that a
larger audience is reached. Posting the postproduction in Teams or Yammer will be
measured in the amount of views. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal communication,
December 19, 2019).
35

Otto Vauhkonen

‘We make your data better for you’ – slogan from Microsoft, by collecting all
organizational data at one place and securing it behind the user credentials the
organization will benefit greatly. Moving to the O365 cloud will provide easily available
data regarding the collaboration inside the organization. Employees will have better tools
for following the processes that they are involved in and get tasks done together at a faster
pace. Furthermore, it will enable a helicopter view on the organizational data for
decisionmakers. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
Prior to the roll-out of Teams, a list of things to consider would be i. Goal for the
implementation of Teams ii. The support of the organizational lead iii. Playbook for
Teams containing the purpose iv. Guidelines for team management and governance v.
Comparison of what was used earlier and what will be used in Teams era vi. Informing
the upcoming change vii. Educating the use. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal
communication, December 19, 2019).
Organizations’ must learn to observe the use of Teams, which are the user groups? What
tasks are they using teams for? How are they using Teams? To measure the use of Teams
is important in order to see the impact of effort put into change management and education
of the new ways to work collaboratively. Depending on the implementation goal the
measurements can be tuned to indicate the success. If the goal has been to move from SfB
to Teams the measurement could be active user count. Active user count could indicate
that the decrease in SfB users is somewhat equal to the increase in Teams users. In this
case the indicator would be positive. In the ideal case, SfB active users would be zero or
close to zero, while Teams active users would be closer to the number of employees or
organizational logins (operative systems, email accounts). In a sales organization the goal
could be to reduce time/add quality in completing offers. If offers would be sent faster or
with a better percentage of containing the right information, then the success would be
equally high. Satisfaction can be measured with surveys, for surveys to work they must
be done prior to implementation to get the starting point and after the roll-out. Work
reworked was a study ordered by Microsoft and conducted by KRC Research and
36

Otto Vauhkonen
supervised by Dr. Michael Parke, Professor at London Business School. (H. Mikkanen,
Microsoft, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
KRC interviewed 9 113 managers and employees from big (+250 employee) companies.
Research included 15 European countries and was conducted during August 2019.
Average amount of responses was 600 per country (500 employees and100 managers)
(Parke, 2019)
If only implementing new tools in order to change work habits the way of working will
not change, instead, the user will try to find ways to continue making the same work as
before with minimum effort to change anything. In the cloud era new features and add-on
applications are pushed out constantly, some basic core functions might be used in most
organizations’, once those basic tasks are mastered the iteration process continues and the
organization must find value-adding features and applications suitable for their and/or
industry-specific needs. Testing new applications in the cloud is simpler than ever,
software is provided in the form of SaaS. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal
communication, December 19, 2019).
Education can be easily made as part of Teams by introducing a help section button that
takes the user to a page with FAQ, a chance to ask for help and use-cases. Teams days are
widely used as support for users in an early stage. Teams clinics and sharing use cases are
proven to be good ways to support the user in adoption. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal
communication, December 19, 2019).
First-time use of Teams will have a strong effect on the perceived usefulness, if the
connection is bad the user will be frustrated. IS that fail to be intuitive will not be adopted
in use and the user will return to the old tool. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal
communication, December 19, 2019).
Pilots are often done wrong in the sense that they lack some specified concrete criteria for
success. If Microsoft promises that Teams will bear the use of 5 000 active users in some
scenario, then it is pointless to pilot this in an organization. Piloting a combination of
37

Otto Vauhkonen
suitable/effective meeting size is another story. If the pilot users are all from IT, then the
benefit of piloting won’t take the organization anywhere. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft,
personal communication, December 19, 2019).
A network of Teams champion is beyond valuable especially at our larger customer
organizations’. Public references such as the City of Helsinki and has had no problem at
all in building a champions network. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal communication,
December 19, 2019). Champion Person who has a desire to change personal, teams and
organizational working habits. Someone willing to share organization-specific guidelines
and best practices. (H. Mikkanen, Microsoft, response to questionnaire for professionals,
Appendix B, 2020)
Microsoft provides material for implementation and Teams has a help section inbuilt in
the software, these are not used enough by the users. The search field provides a list of
shortcuts when user types in “/” and application shortcuts can be found by typing in “@”.
Features can be asked for if they do not exist and once the feature has been voted enough
times it will be raised to the priority list for Microsoft developers. (H. Mikkanen,
Microsoft, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
In the future Teams will provide more suitable next best actions (like sharing a deck of
slides presented in the meeting to all attendees right after the meeting has ended). (H.
Mikkanen, Microsoft, personal communication, December 19, 2019).

6. Discussions with third-party consultants
In order to gather greater knowledge in the subject of how well Microsoft Teams is
implemented at Finnish workplaces and to gather opinions on how to measure a successful
implementation a round of open interviews came as a good tool. The round of interviews
was done as an open dialogue. By asking open questions from professionals, a deep-dive
into their expertise-area was possible. For the round of interviews, the following list of
consultants working with Microsoft Teams were chosen:

6.1 Karoliina Kettukari 4.12.2019

Teams is a platform for collaboration, it brings all tools into one place which enables the
user to have easy access and control for all daily used tools. Teams is implemented at
workplaces for multiple reasons, Teams is mostly implemented as a tool for internal
communications, it adds transparency, makes teamwork more effective, reduces the
amount of different 3rd party tools and systems, adds mobile support for daily tasks,
enables remote working on a professional level. Teams will reduce the amount of mailchains with unnecessary participants. Skype for Business is widely used in Finland and
since it is about to be abandoned and Microsoft is making all new features in Teams,
Teams is a natural tool to implement in most organizations. Teams is a part of the Office
365 Enterprise package and organizations are widely utilizing Microsoft products already,
when moving to the cloud Teams is part of the package. (K. Kettukari, Microsoft MVP,
Senior consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 4, 2019)
Implementing Microsoft Teams is mainly a change management project where the new
way of working is in focus. The employees must be assisted to adopt to the new mindset
of working collaboratively. Besides the change management part of it, Teams setup will
require some basic IT implementation. The IT part of the implementation is about
migrating from the old systems tools and servers to the new ones in the O365 cloud.
Implementation projects often include external help in the form of user adoption
40

Otto Vauhkonen
consultants, Microsoft consultants, change management consultants and IT-data
consultants. The implementation starts off with a planning phase and setting up the tools
(enabling working in the cloud). The project team is supported by internal owners in
various organizational departments. Current state analysis lets the team understand the
starting points of the implementation in different departments. Engaging management is
important, these profiles are often called sponsors. (K. Kettukari, Microsoft MVP, Senior
consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 4, 2019)
‘Champion network is a very important part of the Teams implementation project.
Champions should always be volunteers. They offer a close and fast way of supporting
their team or unit in the change. Champions have also an important role in sharing
information about Teams and the becoming changes. Champions don't have to be ITexperts in the first place, you should always train your champions before letting them
loose.’ (K. Kettukari, Microsoft MVP, Senior consultant at Sulava, response to
questionnaire for professionals, Appendix B, 2020)
Piloting is a widely used method of preparation, it is a good way for finding out challenges
regarding Teams use that are specific for the implementing organization. By piloting and
finding challenges, the solutions will also be easy to make prior to the initial launch of
Teams. The level of technical training and support needed in different parts of the
organization can vary quite a lot. Piloting will help underline best practices that can be
utilized in the communication during the user adoption journey. (K. Kettukari, Microsoft
MVP, Senior consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 4, 2019)
When initializing change, the reason behind the implementation project shall be well
communicated. ‘General company guidelines for the use of supported tools and their
purpose is vital to communicate well to the employees. For example, internal
communication tools and document management tools. Furthermore, a playbook for
Teams should be shared for all employees containing best practices for teamwork,
meetings and task management in Teams. You could also include sections such as "Teams

41

Otto Vauhkonen
for managers"’. (K. Kettukari, Microsoft MVP, Senior consultant at Sulava, response to
questionnaire for professionals, Appendix B, 2020)

6.2 Katja Jokisalo 9.12.2019
Teams is implemented for the reason of SfB going out of service and a new tool is
available. The second reason is to add collaborative working and supply employees with
tools for sharing and collaborating in real-time. Microsoft has plans in making Teams
become the digital desktop for working. Teams will have all software and applications
connected in one window. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at Sulava,
personal communication, December 9, 2019)
Preparations prior to the roll-out of Teams is setting the aim for the use of Teams. If the
only goal is to change to Teams from a legacy system, then an IT-implementation will be
enough. Alternatively, the goal should be to decide on the new ways of working and
committing towards a change, in that case the implementation would be far more about
change management where Teams is a platform and IT-solution that enables it. Percentage
vise IT (10-20%) And change management (80-90%). Microsoft mentions a so-called
playbook, which is a gathering of use-cases and instructions for common ways of using
Teams. Steps in the Teams implementation: 1. Aim 2. Playbook 3. Governance 4.
Planning 5. Execution (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at Sulava,
personal communication, December 9, 2019)
Education that Microsoft shares is not that commonly used by companies. Learning
pathways is a free template that any organization can utilize and make it look their own.
This way Microsoft material can be copied to own instructions page and the own use cases
can be built on top of that. Educating employees is expensive due to missed work time on
actual work tasks. Organizations’ do not want to educate in generic use cases but rather
on organization-specific use. ROI is better on point when an external consultant is bought
to tailor the education material suitable for the organization rather than having the
42

Otto Vauhkonen
employee complete self-study with low motivation and generic material. Education for
employees regarding Teams shall not be basic functions in Teams but rather the new ways
of working by utilizing teams. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at Sulava,
personal communication, December 9, 2019)
Piloting the use of Teams is done by most of the companies in Finland, the amount of
piloting varies. The piloting is usually conducted at some IT-department where functions
suitability to the organizational needs are evaluated, on the basis of this the plan for scaling
to the whole organization is made. Piloting will investigate how the new ways of working
will align with previously set rules. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at
Sulava, personal communication, December 9, 2019)
Teams champions are used by us in all customer implementation projects. Creating a
champions network is by far the most effective way to assist the employee in the adoption
to Teams. Champions are volunteers that are interested in learning new and be part of the
change. Champions do not have to be managers or technologically skilled, but it will not
hurt to be either or both. The idea is to have a variety of champions from all over the
organization. Eagerness to share experiences and educate/ help others is needed from the
champions. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at Sulava, personal
communication, December 9, 2019)
Resistance to change usually roots from fear of not being able to understand or learn to
use the new technology. People have different experiences and relations towards the use
of technology. Some require more motivating and assistance than others. Resistance
towards Microsoft products was higher years ago when the first cloud migrations began.
If there are some percentage of employees resistant to change, they should not be given
too much attention. If there is resistance in manager-level some actions towards it might
be needed as they influence subordinates. Helping the individual find a motive for the use
of Teams will help the person to adopt to change. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior
Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 9, 2019)

Otto Vauhkonen
Measuring the success of an implementation has both easy to prove indicators and more
complex indicators, depending on the implementation and the aim for it. Measuring
movement from a legacy system to Teams is a straightforward thing but it will only show
the transition and not the applied new ways of working. Amount of calls, reduced amount
of emails and so on, is easy to follow and important to follow as well. The other side of
measurement of success lies in the aim for the implementation of teams, goals could
involve more efficient meetings, increased perceived enjoyment of work, less traveling,
more open collaborative working, less bottlenecks, easy access to files. The latter one is
more difficult to measure. (K. Jokisalo, Microsoft MVP, Senior Consultant at Sulava,
personal communication, December 9, 2019)

6.3 Vesa Nopanen 11.12.2019

Teams is a platform. Teams is not a tool for just one single thing. Teams enables
collaboration but the future of Teams is a platform where tools and collaboration can be
retailed specifically according to the organization’s needs. Collaborative work,
communication and teamwork is in big focus. There is no one fits all type of
implementation for Teams. But the most widely used first functions to be used are i.
Collaborative spaces SharePoint documents and Teams conversations ii. Meetings
(Calling and arranging meetings). Teams combines stakeholders and documents (Notes,
messages, files in general) by supplying the tools for communication (Meetings, video &
audio calls, calendar). Sharing screen using collaborative documents and whiteboards are
just a few of the features, a list of possible future features is endless. Teams is like a
megaportal that can be connected to anything from bots to backend systems and webbased applications. The main functionality of Teams is not to be specified in advance, it
depends on the user using it and the tasks most essential for that user. The beauty of Teams
is how versatile it is and that anyone can find a use for it. (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP,
Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11, 2019)
First companies in Finland to implement Teams did not make especially much noise about
it, there is always a question of giving reference from a project towards the consulting
44

Otto Vauhkonen
firms. When the implementation is guided by consultants but made as an inner change
management project that includes questions regarding communication security, some
want to keep the information for themselves. When Teams was new there were obviously
fewer features and the usage has evolved from there to become the platform it is today. In
some cases, Teams was implemented prior to it being a mature product. (V. Nopanen,
Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11,
2019)
Governance is important prior to roll-out. How & Which teams will be created, who will
have the access? How will information be secured (Passwords & Time limitations).
(V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication,
December 11, 2019) Important roles to delegate are ownership of Teams ‘Who owns
Microsoft Teams?’ ‘Usually Teams ownership is divided between different people/units.
There needs to be an owner and executive sponsor who understands what Teams is and
why it is important that the project succeeds.’ (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP, Principal
Consultant at Sulava, response to questionnaire for professionals, Appendix B, 2020)
Implementing Teams purely as a technical implementation will lead to incongruent use of
Teams. The unclear vision of use cases and rules will lead to missed opportunities in effect
of the collaborative work. Making the use clear for employees is vital, this can be achieved
by introducing a so-called playbook for the employees. (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP,
Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11, 2019) The
Playbook for Teams could contain topics such as ‘why we are using Teams’, ‘why
teamwork and Teams is important to our company’, ‘what changes with Teams’ and ‘what
benefits it brings’. Furthermore, ‘how should we communicate in Teams’, ‘where can I
find help’, ‘what tool to use and when’, ‘where are documents stored’, ‘when to create a
channel and when to create a team’, ‘general practices’ and ‘how do I give feedback if I
don't agree with something’. (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at
Sulava, response to questionnaire for professionals, Appendix B, 2020)

45

Otto Vauhkonen
Implications regarding the acceptance of Teams can originate from various reasons.
Resistance to change has often a root-problem in understanding, anxiety, Teams being out
of comfort zone, previous experiences. Understanding value for the user itself will add
motivation towards using Teams, personal value can be found from different things.
Finding value for the person resisting will help the person to adopt Teams. (V. Nopanen,
Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11,
2019)
Online education provided by Microsoft can be useful for the technical education of
Teams, anyhow, creating instructions suitable for the organization and as own content is
important since general videos are becoming outdated quite fast and they lack the
opportunity for the user to relate as an employee. Microsoft shares teasers and their
educational content suits well for early adopters of the software. (V. Nopanen, Microsoft
MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11, 2019)
‘Teams Champion is a person who is telling others why the right use of Teams is
important and how it can bring in benefits to everyday work-life. They provide ideas and
tell about shared and best practices and work as a peer to peer support to their coworkers.
They are partly evangelists and convert Teams capabilities to real-world work scenarios
in a way that their coworkers can understand. They also innovate new practices on how
more benefits will become available.’ (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant
at Sulava, response to questionnaire for professionals, Appendix B, 2020). The employees
selected as champions do not have to be early adopters of the software, the interest and
evangelist / power-user attitude is key. Champions will need to get educated anyway to
become skilled enough for helping others. No specific rule ratio between champion and
employee, but roughly one per fifty employees, again depends on the organization. (V.
Nopanen, Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication,
December 11, 2019)
Measuring the success of implementation of Teams is mostly soft side data (polls/
surveys) Asking the users how they feel about the change and use of Teams. Numeric
46

Otto Vauhkonen
measurements are more difficult to tune in a way where they will be specific and prove
success. Mail message amounts might or might not be affected using Teams, internal mail
amounts alone are another thing. When measuring numbers, you must be careful in
choosing what conclusions are drawn from the results. (V. Nopanen, Microsoft MVP,
Principal Consultant at Sulava, personal communication, December 11, 2019)
In the future ‘Teams will be the hub for work and via that you can access all essential apps
and services needed at work. It will be also used in personal/community/hobby groups
(for Life). Teams will be the standard of teamwork and communication.’ (V. Nopanen,
Microsoft MVP, Principal Consultant at Sulava, response to questionnaire for
professionals, Appendix B, 2020)

6.4 Juha Lindfors 13.1.2020
Teams is a combining place for daily work tasks. Employees will have all tools in one
shared place and, therefore, the need for multiple software open at once will be reduced.
Teams is enabling document editing and collaboration in a transparent way where all team
members can discuss topics while collaborating. Meetings and collaboration will be more
structured in Teams than traditional email. Meetings will have better quality once moving
to Teams. The best thing about Teams is no single feature, but rather the possibility of
endless combinations of applications and features used in a collaborative way. (J.
Lindfors, Chief of Finance & Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal
communication, January 13, 2020).
The most popular aim with a Teams implementation project is mainly to replace Skype
for Business as a tool for online meetings and remote work. The common case is that the
organization is using SfB and Microsoft Teams at the same time, in these cases the reason
for Teams implementation must be investigated and then taken the needed steps towards
making it the primary and thereafter primary tool for communication. To learn what
features of Teams is used and by what group of people, is a vital first step in planning a
change for working more collaboratively. In many organization Teams is just brought to
47

Otto Vauhkonen
general use without planning the use cases and structuring common rules. (J. Lindfors,
Chief of Finance & Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication,
January 13, 2020).
The most central part of a Teams implementation project is to specify the goal for the
implementation. What problem will Teams solve? What will Teams be used for? And
what will the use of Teams enable? Forming a good understanding of the day-to-day work
and the tasks that it consists of is extremely important. Once you manage to understand
the employee day-to-day activities you can plan and execute a successful change in the
tools that are used and add effectivity to these tasks. Tools must be replaced instead of
just adding tools on top of the ones already used. (J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance &
Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication, January 13, 2020).
In global companies more effort is needed. Things must be planned well ahead in order to
reach a desired outcome. Cultural change, organizational structure after mergers and
acquisitions form the organization to become unique and manifold. Implementation of
Teams is like a journey from place A to place B. When determining the use case and end
goal for the implementation, B will be the same clear picture for all parts of the
organization. Point A, the starting point can vary quite a lot in global organizations
depending on for instance legacy systems or cultural differences and most of all the people
involved, thus, the journey will be different for all locations. For large scale organizations’
more attention is needed in order to give all locations enough attention and guidance in
adopting the new. (J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance & Technology, Principal Consultant at
CCEA, personal communication, January 13, 2020).
Change resistance could be used as a term, but preferably it shall be spoken of as
uncertainty or fear of the new incoming change. Root-problem is usually that the person
does not understand or see the opportunities but rather the trouble in learning to use some
new software. By making the reason for change as clear and personalized as possible will
help in realizing the concrete personal benefits of the new. There will always be one tiny
group of people that want to resist all external change, those might just need more time to
48

Otto Vauhkonen
adopt and too much effort should not be wasted on fighting the resistance. (J. Lindfors,
Chief of Finance & Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication,
January 13, 2020).
Technical education is not the most important in implementing Teams since it is an
intuitive software that is easy to use, and online tips and help can be easily found. The
basic use functions and the goal for the use of the tool is vital to communicate to the users.
(J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance & Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal
communication, January 13, 2020).
In planning work the timeframe for the project scope will be assessed according to team
resources and knowledge from previous projects as well as customer needs and wants but
foremost on the basis of the organization size and complexity of migrating legacy data to
the cloud. In global organizations’ there will be added tasks from translation work and
managing multiple locations at once. (J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance & Technology,
Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication, January 13, 2020).
Document sharing can be a good indicator of Teams usage, shared documents to Share
Point versus the amount of shared document in Outlook can indicate the course that Teams
usage have taken. An employee pulse survey is a great tool for finding out the attitude
towards the new tools as a big picture. From there results to the survey can be used to
detect areas where more assistance is needed. (J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance &
Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication, January 13, 2020).
Piloting and a champions networks are useful tools for the implementation. Champions
can advise end-users at the offices and give close assistance by being physically reachable.
Pilots are used widely in most project work nowadays and function as an extended proof
for the planned work. From a pilot it is easy to optimize things before launching on a big
scale and scaling can always be done gradually. (J. Lindfors, Chief of Finance &
Technology, Principal Consultant at CCEA, personal communication, January 13, 2020).

49

Otto Vauhkonen
6.5 Heidi Selkäinaho 8.1.2020

Teams implementation should be a controlled process where the use of Teams is planned
carefully prior to the use. Planning work can consist of thinking about what kind of teams
there exist in the organization and what kind of main channels they need to have in order
to work in a collaborative way. Chat groups are often formed in unnecessary amounts at
workplaces where the implementation is only done as an IT implementation, this can
become extremely frustrating when there are multiple chat groups with loads of messages
not relevant to all group members. Instead of chatgroups the channels should be used and
that requires some planning and education in for of a set of ground principles or rules.
(H. Selkäinaho, Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer / Consultant / Speaker at Somepoint,
personal communication, January 8, 2020).
Teams is being implemented for i. project work where all project-related content is in one
place and stakeholders from different teams or even organizations can collaborate all in
one place, ii. Teamwork between internal departments (for instance sales & logistics) or
iii. Cross organizational communication in especially smaller organizations’ <5000
employees. Teams or Yammer should however not be used as Intra page. (H. Selkäinaho,
Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer/Consultant/Speaker at Somepoint, personal communication,
January 8, 2020).
Planning work prior to implementation consists of planning of the teams that are needed,
use of tools and tasks that they are suited for, set of rules (playbook) and lastly educating
the employees on the different channels and teams. Organizing an imposing launch event
on a specific go-live date is a good idea in order to achieve more impact. Microsoft
themselves like to mention use-cases. Piloting the implementation of Teams is essential
due to the information and problems that occur and help the team to understand how the
implementation must be further optimized. Furthermore, the pilot user stories can be used
as use-cases. (H. Selkäinaho, Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer/Consultant/Speaker at
Somepoint, personal communication, January 8, 2020).

50

Otto Vauhkonen
Workshops for employees with the use of basic features is worth arranging. 1,5-3 hours is
a suitable amount of time for covering the basics. Support arranged locally is needed and
a champions network is a good tool for that. The network of people driving change has
many names such as: Digital agents, change agents, champions and so forth, the main idea
is always the same, you can call them whatever that suits your organization. Champions
are usually chosen from people with interest to drive change and be part of something
new, seldom managers but a good variety of employees from various parts of the
organization is good. (H. Selkäinaho, Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer/Consultant/Speaker at
Somepoint, personal communication, January 8, 2020).
It will be difficult to drive change in usage of Teams once the organization has already
started using Teams and it has gone to an uncontrolled state. Furthermore, if the
organization is working collaboratively with a partner organization the use of Teams can
easily become a mentor-mentee type of situation where the organization that already has
implemented Teams has to guide the partner organization in the use of Teams. IT
departments have usually been on the right track regarding the newest system versions.
Problem can be in producing organizations’ where all employees might not have an email,
this is obviously needed for Teams. Mobile use is almost used by all employees, if the
device is not owned by the employer there might be needed to set a requirement of added
mobile security via a downloadable application such as Microsoft Intune which ensures
that devices are always protected by a passcode. Implementation of Teams must be
supported by the organizational lead and by communication it shall be made clear that
Teams is the prior communications channel for the whole organization. Thus, employees
cannot resist using Teams if they wish to be a part of the organization. (H. Selkäinaho,
Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer/Consultant/Speaker at Somepoint, personal communication,
January 8, 2020).
Teams implementation can be measured from Microsoft Office admin view, chat message
numbers compared to channel messages is a good measurement, if messages are open for
all to see in channels then the implementation has at least been somewhat successfully
implemented. Employee satisfaction should be measured, and in the results, especially
51

communication-related questions should be kept an eye on during the implementation and
when measuring the afterward results. (H. Selkäinaho, Entrepreneur, Senior Trainer /
Consultant / Speaker at Somepoint, personal communication, January 8, 2020).

6.6 Janne Ariluoto 22.1.2020
Elisa Oyj is a large organization in the telecommunications industry with various domains
in B2C and B2B communications, entertainment and online services. At Elisa the
implementation of Microsoft Teams was made as an in-house implementation since the
knowhow is to be found from in-house professionals that consult business customers in
Microsoft Office365 cloud services. Teams has been piloted and used first by Elisa cloud
consultants and then scaled across the whole organization. Microsoft Teams was
implemented in the large organization for various reasons such as added transparency,
getting rid of bottlenecks, added mobility, tool for remote working and replacing the huge
internal use of Skype for Business. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal
communication, January 22, 2020).
Teams as a technical implementation was done in an early stage and the internal roll-out
was planned and executed once it felt comfortable. Elisa has an internal department that
finds constantly new ways of working more efficiently. The switch to Teams only is
practically impossible since some customers are still using SfB. The aim is to constantly
tear down old software that Teams can replace and by these actions Teams will become
more beneficial for us as an organization. There are departments and employees that are
using Teams as a single tool for communications (Teams-only). Elisa has set a date for
Teams only (to be informed in the future). Users that are in Teams only do not miss SfB.
The value provided by Teams for Elisa has not been in the possibility of working remotely
or arranging meetings/calls. The culture of working from home and arranging meetings
has already been present with the use of SfB. Roll-out of Teams happened in September
2018, the timing was good due to it being right after summer vacations. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud
Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January 22, 2020).

52

Otto Vauhkonen
Elisa business development manager oversaw the implementation of Teams as a change
manager. HR function had the ownership in the implementation. The internal
communications team and IT team were involved in the implementing team. A clear
roadmap was determined for the implementation and the plan held well. Challenge in the
implementation was to make the change internally that is usually made at the client. The
same implementation varies since the client work is always prioritized and must be made
at the same time. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January
22, 2020).
Prior to roll-out the managerial commitment shall be secured. In terms of technical
readiness, the operative systems and other firmware should be up to date. Data migration
should be investigated and planned well beforehand. Playbooks are usually used to
determine the use for O365 as a whole package and therein questions such as aim for the
implementation, data life cycle and repository, security, and use-cases. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud
Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January 22, 2020).
Education for use of Teams has been arranged, the suitable duration for a workshop has
been 1-2 hours, one workshop lasted 3 hours which received feedback for being
exhausting. Online material (education recordings) is used by employees. Morning coffee
meetings lasting 15 minutes have been held often and it as proven to be an effective way
of educating use-cases or new features. A one-hour workshop in a group combined with
shorter 15min online coffee breaks works well. Sessions with specific user groups or
organizational departments have also been organized in order to future iterate the use for
the specific work tasks according to needs. Customers like to purchase online educations
since they tend to be cheaper. The value of workshops is that also the sensitive users will
be able to ask questions specific to their needs after the lectures. Resistance to change
often originate in individual readiness, all employees have different standpoints. By
assisting employees at the office, being open and explaining and communicating use-cases
the resistance will decrease. Tackling negative presumptions and images with concrete
use-cases and user stories is vital. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal
communication, January 22, 2020).
53

Otto Vauhkonen

Understanding of the project scope and the size of the involvement needed is often
missing. Change regarding ways to work is not planned, nor is the need to change seen
from inside the organization. Hence, change is not budgeted, it requires external help to
gain involvement from organizational lead. The project responsibility is usually focusing
on time and money allocated on the project. The focus should be on the success of forming
new better ways of working. The project of new ways of working is a constant iteration
that will never be ready. It is the consultant’s responsibility to get the management to
internalize that. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January
22, 2020).
Traditional piloting is a rather old part of the implementation. Using a champions network
with employees interested in driving change is valuable for the organizational change.
Project champions shall be used in generally all implementations projects. Champions
meetups where questions and new use-cases are good to arrange every now and then, it is
important to remember that the champions network is eating up tome from normal daily
tasks and equals therefore also expenses for the organization. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud
Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January 22, 2020).
Measuring the success of an implementation can best be done by qualitative measurements
such as surveys that measure the attitude towards employment and collaboration within
the organization. Measuring efficiently of the tasks and tools are not easy to optimize in
numerical ways. Counted emails sent compared to usage numbers of Teams are not
accurate metrics due to the aim of increased shared information within the organization.
Numbers can assist as directional indicators but shall not be tracked in a fixated manner.
(J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal communication, January 22, 2020).
Users tend to use chat groups where channels should be utilized. Time and cost will vary
depending on the organization. The initial state of technical competence determines the
amount of needed technical education. In organizations’ where the employees are mainly
knowledgeable workers the implementation and use of Teams will be easier to complete
54

Otto Vauhkonen
and more valuable. (J. Ariluoto, Cloud Consultant at Elisa, personal communication,
January 22, 2020).

7. Discussions with Company solution owners
By asking consultants, hired by Finnish companies, a whole lot of important material was
to be found. As a project or purchase in any known case, there is always a selling
side/provider of a service or a product (in this case expertise in the form of consultancy)
and a buyer side (in this case the implementing organization). To see the other side of the
projects, interviews with company solution owners was conducted.
7.1 Max Henttu 11.12.2019
Implementation of Teams was not on the priority of our projects, therefore, the time
allocated for the project was minimal. The aim of implementing Teams was to get
documents and conversations mobile. Consultants visit clients constantly and the security
of documents and mobility of them is important. We wanted to be amongst the first in
using Teams in order to be ahead of our clients. Project managers were involved in the
piloting on top of that some opinion leaders (influential seniors) and vital users were
invited to the pilot as well. One customer project functioned as a pilot as well. (M. Henttu,
Director, Delivery at Trainers House, personal communication, December 11, 2019).
We did not arrange any champions program; the only champion was the person in charge.
The project managers, opinion leaders and the rest of the pilot team helped with scaling
the use of Teams in our organization. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery at Trainers House,
personal communication, December 11, 2019).
Educational material was tailored according to the demand for answers to certain
questions. Use cases were made by screenshots and videos and shared as fast as possible
to the whole user group. Users want exact instructions to their questions and no generic
material can provide that. Some employees require a lot more time in adopting and might
need to be walked through the basic functions of Teams. For the individual employee
55

Otto Vauhkonen
adoption, it is solely about mastering the functions essential for day-to-day tasks.
Employees had to be motivated towards the change except for some employees that had
been waiting for the change (devoted users). Devoted users take the learning in their own
hands and dare to try out new applications and features on their own. The confusion
around how OneDrive, SharePoint and Teams are connected takes time to explain.
Version of all software is important to be up to date. Usage of documents, calls and
meetings (basic functions) were mastered by employees fast. Educating the employees
further would require the employees to do themselves, peer to peer education will take the
adoption of Teams further and in our organization knowledge of the use will be shared.
Tools for IT are part of the culture and employees will use them in order to be part of the
organization. Skype is still used in conference rooms due to technicalities with hardware.
Channels are used in group conversation purpose and chats are used in 1-to-1
conversations. WhatsApp chats are used for more casual conversations. Email has been
reduced and mail chains that include lots of people are history, the discussion has moved
to channels in Teams. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery at Trainers House, personal
communication, December 11, 2019).
Teams channels had a max number of users (200) this came as a surprise to us, the
information was back then not to be easily found. Data migration took time but enabled
us to get rid of on-premise servers. Our security got updated to a more secure state. Mobile
use was also a goal that we had with the implementation of Teams. The requirement was
that employee time on Teams adoption would be minimal. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery
at Trainers House, personal communication, December 11, 2019).
Our IT-partner helped with planning, piloting and technological selections. Legacy
systems contained a lot of data that took time to migrate to the cloud. Project management
required quite a lot of work and the implementation of Teams was more reactive than
anticipated. Implementation was both an IT and change management project. In terms of
IT the Windows operative systems that were not yet upgraded had to be upgraded to
Windows 10. The change management part was heavy since the complexity of O365 is
not easy to explain to an employee that has no prior use of it. The organization consists of
56

Otto Vauhkonen
two totally separate departments and their ways of work differ much from each other. No
room for breaks in usage could be afforded, there was a time when we had both the legacy
system and Teams in use, finally for getting all data moved some deadlines for data
migration had to be set in order for employees to move their material to the Office 365
cloud. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery at Trainers House, personal communication,
December 11, 2019).
Requesting offers from external consultants to help did not match our expectations.
Looking back the need would have been for a consultant to be observing the organization
from inside for x amount of time and answering questions regarding data migration and
O365 products. A consultant with Teams set as spearhead would not have suited our
needs. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery at Trainers House, personal communication,
December 11, 2019).
Rules for setup of channels (teams) in Teams were strict right from the start, an
implementation where Teams would have been free for all to use as they prefer would
only have ended in chaos. Being a professional at change management and being familiar
with the organization was a huge asset in leading the implementation. Mapping out the
current state and required actions for migration from legacy systems cannot be done too
well. Time allocated for leading an implementation will be required, it is easily
underestimated. Partner in the implementation needs to be close and available to answers
questions. (M. Henttu, Director, Delivery at Trainers House, personal communication,
December 11, 2019).

7.2 Heidi Von Bell 19.12.2019
Controlled implementation of Microsoft Teams is important in organizations’. Teams
implementation is partly technological yet the most is to be done in the change
management field of the implementation. Teams is not that difficult to use but learning
the mentality to the way we work collaboratively is extremely important. Communicating
the change, goal, and use-cases is the key to a successful implementation.
57

Otto Vauhkonen
Communications cannot be done too much of, the work to be done is enormous.
Resistance is decreased by communicating about the change, why it is changing, and how
it is changing. If the picture is clear and all employees understand what is about to be
done, then the implementation will be a success. All communications channels shall be
utilized in communicating the change. Getting the organizational lead involved in the
change is important and by sharing material in various formats the change cannot be
missed by anyone in the organization. (H. von Bell, Communications Manager at
Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
Teams will add transparent working and collaborative working, information is flowing
better while using Teams. Information is easier available, and the risk of documents being
hidden on local personal drives or as attachments in mail chains disappears. (H. von Bell,
Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
In big organizations’ the need for external partners is extremely important I have had
enormous help form Digital Illustrated in implementing Teams at both my current and
previously employing company. I am forever grateful for the help that I received; the
partner was pure gold. Consultants live and breathe Microsoft products and they have indepth knowledge of the O365 package. (H. von Bell, Communications Manager at
Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
When choosing a partner, the importance of finding a consultancy that has can-do
mentality and is ready to pull up their sleeves and do work together as a member of the
executing team is vital. Buying a deal for the implementation that is split into specific
stages of the implementation and stuck to a timeframe is pleasant from the buyer point of
view. The option for a prolongation is always part of a good contract. (H. von Bell,
Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
We had a total of 8 pilot teams where Teams was tested out prior to scaling to the whole
organization. The board and lead groups were involved in this piloting right from the start.
The interest grew to be part of the piloting right from the start. When aiming for organic
58

Otto Vauhkonen
user growth during an implementation of Teams it is important to have the lead involved
in piloting, some low-level management teams and as one pilot team we had a project
management department that got to try using teams only for the whole project and avoid
using email. The use of Teams right from the start in real context was a good practice.
Pilots shall not be too many at the same time in order to be able to keep track of the pilot
teams. (H. von Bell, Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication,
December 19, 2019).
Understanding the use cases for own work tasks is key to support the adoption. Thus, the
need for diverse pilot teams rise. By choosing use-cases from various pilot teams the
employees have a better chance to relate to at least some of the different use cases which
add motivation and interest towards adopting the use of Teams in the own day-to-day
work. Employees need to find the inner motivation towards the use of the software.
Resistance will always be part of implementation projects. Time will solve the problem
and it is important not to get stuck on those who resist change. (H. von Bell,
Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
Problematic use earlier was Windows 7 operating systems, Windows 10 was needed.
Internet Explorer could not be used which was difficult to explain to the end-user.
Documents were saves in local drives, network-attached storage (NAS), on-premise
classic SharePoint, and simultaneously with implementing Teams we implemented Office
365 SharePoint. It was a struggle to get all employees to move from NAS to cloud. (H.
von Bell, Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19,
2019).
Basic use functions for Teams can be shared via online channels. At S-Group Digital
Illustrated helped in creating a center for instructions for all collaborative tools in
SharePoint containing help and use cases from the pilots. Local workshops were good for
the beginning. We did not use any ready material by Microsoft but rather our own material
like promo videos and images in communications channels. Microsoft playbook and other
practices by Microsoft were used, the knowledge stream clearly goes from Microsoft to
59

Otto Vauhkonen
third-party consultants and then to various companies. Companies share knowledge and
discuss the projects with other communications managers in Finland. (H. von Bell,
Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal communication, December 19, 2019).
Measuring the implementation was done at S-Group with the use of Microsoft Power BI.
Dashboards showed usage numbers on the company level. Amount of sent emails, Teams
usage, SharePoint usage, and so forth. A clear correlation with pilot start dates and drop
in sent emails was to be seen. Email amount dropped to the same level as during summer
vacations and simultaneously Teams a SharePoint usage increased so much that it was no
doubt about the reason. (H. von Bell, Communications Manager at Tikkurila, personal
communication, December 19, 2019).

7.3 Anonymous Senior Communications Manager 16.01.2020
Biggest reason to implement O365 for us was to get rid of an old communications tool
once some essential fixes were made to the old system employees were already frustrated
and attitude towards the whole system was on a bad level. In a global company that we
are a cross-organizational system for conferencing and document sharing is essential. At
the end of 2017 idea came to get the whole Microsoft office 365 implemented to the
organization after summer 2018 Teams was also implemented. Skype for Business worked
as a tool for communication during the migration. Teams was already available but not
yet as mature as we wanted. Skype was from the beginning going to be just a part-time
solution while the setup for Teams was planned. Landing an implementation with full
success was a priority. (Anonymous, Senior Communications Manager, personal
communication, January 16, 2020)
External change manager was involved in the implementation for 9 -10months with the
first part on full-time allocation and till the end of the year as part-time. The same change
management consultancy took care of the project owner position and oversaw the
implementation whole project. As a technical IT partner, we had Sulava Oy as the main
partner and some others for smaller parts like for instance one that helped us out in the
60

Otto Vauhkonen
data migration from our legacy system. Also, to mention we had one company assisting
in mobile security. On top of that we had a communications agency that helped us with
campaign planning and execution. Some of our team visited another company to learn
how they had executed a similar implementation project. The execution of the project was
good, and we were satisfied for all partners that assisted us. (Anonymous, Senior
Communications Manager, personal communication, January 16, 2020)
The amount of emails compared to SharePoint did not take any radical immediate turn.
There is a strong correlation in effective work and reduced email traffic. Often mails are
forwarded, and people are sent courtesy copies (CCs) tagged in mail chains as if they were
chat-channels. (Anonymous, Senior Communications Manager, personal communication,
January 16, 2020)
Implementation of O365 is an ongoing project that is never finished, there are still many
employees that use Teams and we have gone from using both Skype for Business and
Teams to Teams only. The single best thing in the implementation project was our
‘collaboration coach network’ consisting of 150 change agents (The Project Champion).
We educated these change agents that were in 78 divisions spread over 34 countries. The
thought was to have at least one coach per organizational department and in bigger
departments have multiple agents. The departments decided themselves who would
become the change agent. What might have motivated the individuals most to become
change agents was the opportunity of being part of an international project. We wanted
these profiles to be active members of their departments. Their task was to attend
workshops and become skilled in using O365 for them to arrange educational events in
their departments. We had trouble getting attendants on online workshops already with
the previous communications tool and had online education in this implementation as
well, still, educational events are much more efficient when held in physical locations.
Education was not technical usage of the tool but rather a mindset of the way of working
collaboratively. We also held some Digital collaborations theme days were functions and
use cases were presented. Influencing the adoption was mostly pitching the new system
as easy to use and bring up use cases. Showing examples of how for instance version
61

Otto Vauhkonen
history and document duplicates were no longer a burden in the cloud, worked as a good
motivator. Finding issues with the legacy system was not a problem, by proving that those
could be solved by the new system brought a better image for the end-users (employees).
(Anonymous, Senior Communications Manager, personal communication, January 16,
2020)
The time allocated to the project could have been longer. Migrating email was the most
time-consuming and the migration had to be done at the same time as we planned the
work. The timeframe for the project was set as one year and was based on the need to
move from the old platform provider prior to the current license would expire. Planning
the migration could have been done better and in beforehand. Resistance to change will
happen in all implementations and too much effort should not be put in fighting alone
rebels. Finding the root of the problem can be anything. No major problems with hardware
occurred, some slight implication with Microsoft Explorer web browser. Recourses (time
& money) are always a tough question, the planning is a big part of the implementation.
Change management is an investment for the future way of working and collaborating.
Mapping out the best tools to use is vital for a good start with O365. (Anonymous, Senior
Communications Manager, personal communication, January 16, 2020)

8. Implementation datapoints – (Company x)
The success of a Microsoft Teams implementation project can be (to some extent)
measured in user data. Figure 13 Private chat data (Company x) shows the increased
volume of sent private chat messages within Microsoft Teams at a global company. The
steep rise in Teams messages indicates the result for a successful migration from using
Skype to using Teams-only when shutting down the internal use of Skype for Business
(SfB). In Figure 12 company x transition into Teams-only mode is clear from the user
counts of SfB. The exact date is 05.11.2019 and the use of SfB is ending within one day.

Figure 12 Skype for business messages (Company x)

Private chat message count indicates well the daily use of Teams during the change from

an old communications software. The short drops each week are weekends and the bigger

drop is happening during the Christmas holidays (Indicates good work-life balance).

Private Chat messages do not add transparency within the company and, therefore, the

number of channel messages is a more important measurement for collaborative work.

Team chat messages count indicates the message amount in channels. Channels can be
read by all stakeholders and work as forums instead of chat groups where all users
involved receive notifications when there is a new message. In channels questions can be
asked from the whole group instead of aimed towards individuals. Thus, the person that
has an answer can provide it and others will see that the question has been solved.
Therefore, involved users will not all have to bother to think of an answer. The standard
number of meetings and calls is a good indicator for reoccurring daily meetings being held
within the company. Figure 14 Messages / Calls / Meetings (Company x) The other

9. Structure of questionnaires
9.1 Appendix A. Microsoft Teams – End-user survey

The end-user survey was completed by a total of 82 office workers in Finland. The age of
the respondents was not gathered in this study, instead, the respondents were asked to
provide their work experience in number of years. The average work experience in years
amongst respondents was 11. A section of Personal Interest in Information Technology
64

Otto Vauhkonen
(PIIT) was added to study the correlation between self-evaluation of IT-skills and adaption
of MS Teams into daily work tasks.
The decision to exclude gender from this questionnaire was made on the fact that previous
research hypothesis has shown no significance. ‘Gender will positively moderate the
inﬂuence of subjective norm on behavioral intentions to use computers for men – not
significant’ (Venkatesh et al., 2003; Al-Gahtani, Hubona and Wang, 2007)
End-user questionnaires were sent out to organizations and spread across social media.
The questionnaire with a total of 35 questions can be found in chapter 17. Appendixes.
For the gathering of answers, a lot of effort was needed since approximately 3000 views
on a single social media post on LinkedIn, converted to 55 answers. The post was aimed
at office workers using Microsoft Teams and the message was that as many as possible
would either fill out the end-user questionnaire and/or like the post. The post got +130
engagements and multiple comments which all assisted the organic spread.
End-user questionnaires were also spread internally in multiple organizations and received
answers from a wide variety of different organizational departments and with a good
variety in years of work experience as Figure 15 indicates. Average work experience
measured in years was 11,29.

Teams
The second questionnaire was sent to the professionals mentioned in chapter 2.2 Open
personal discussions. Questions can be found in chapter 17.2 Appendix B. Questions for
Consultants and Professionals working with Microsoft Teams.
Out of all end-user survey respondents (n=80) in the end-user questionnaire, the average
start date for using Microsoft Teams was 29.05.2019 which in comparison to the same
number for professionals (n=8) working with Teams implementations (average start date
of 21.08.2017) shows that professionals are (as they should) close to 2 years ahead of the
game.

Figure 18 Respondents to Appendix B

10. Results
The study shows that almost all the respondents that are using Microsoft Teams as a tool
for internal communication at their work, also use Skype for Business. This will be the
next maturity stage in the use of the Implementation of Microsoft Teams. According to
discussions had with Microsoft personnel, the stage in the adoption of Microsoft Teams
where alternative communications software are dropped out is called: Teams-Only. The
67

Otto Vauhkonen
so-called Teams Only phase is not yet complete at most Finnish workplaces. The
importance of focusing on one main tool for communications shall not be forgotten.
Results to the end-user questionnaire indicates that tools used for internal communications
are used in various combinations. As Figure 18 indicates, users are combining the use of
communications software at their workplace. The transfer from using old communications
tools to using Teams is happening but the transfer to a Teams-only state is in the future
for many organizations’. Using one tool will clarify the communication within the
organization and ease the task of finding information from old conversations. One
respondent wrote: ‘We have it and I will start when somebody invites me, I use Zoom’
(End-User Questionnaire respondent) ‘it’ referring to Microsoft Teams. Proof of an
implementation project with high maturity would be the use of one tool only, or at least
clearly more than others. The unnecessary combination of multiple tools makes
conversation (chat) history and the task of locating files become a difficult and timeconsuming task.

Figure 19 Appendix A. Microsoft Teams – End-user survey Q6

As discussed already in the introduction chapter, Microsoft has struggled with people
restricting the use of their products due to various reasons in the past, to investigate the
so-called “Hatred on Microsoft” two questions in the field of resistance towards
68

Otto Vauhkonen
acceptance of Microsoft products were asked both groups of questionnaire respondents.
The question was branched in a way that respondents answering “yes” or “partly yes” to
the question regarding the existence of hatred (Figure 20) would be asked to elaborate on
the reasons why (Table 2 & Table 3).

End users - Q7: Is
"Microsoft hatred" a

History of Microsoft
‘People are stuck in the early 2000s image of MS.’
‘Microsoft products have a reputation of being complex and confusing, poor
usability and issues with reliability and stability. I have to say that I think there
is some truth to these beliefs...’
‘Brought up with Win3.x and win95, which were terrible for work. From XP
onwards they finally started to get a decent tool. Win10/O365 are quite
brilliant. Still, old schoolers don't forget the amount of lost data and time due to
frequent Win crashes’
Microsoft being a tech giant
‘When something is used widely, there's always hatred towards it’
‘Microsoft is used too often as "the only alternative’
‘Some people can see large corporations as faceless greedy entities’
Rivalry between OS supporters
‘It’s part of the mac vs windows argument’
‘"True" Linux fans do not use Microsoft products (with exception from a
virtual machine). Linux based product development is also easier to complete
on native Linux. For some reason Mac is considered ok.’
Expectations regarding UX not being met
‘people have big expectations towards it and smallest failures makes them
mad’
Table 2 Negative attitudes towards Microsoft Appendix A.
History of Microsoft
It is due to Microsoft history: the first impression to some people is that
Microsoft stands for something negative and bloated. It takes a long time to
change.
70

Otto Vauhkonen
It stems from the history when there were no real alternatives to Microsoft
solutions. I see the situation has changed a bit lately globally, but not so much
in Finland.
That is typically comparing competing solutions to Microsoft's old offerings
from early 2000's without real-world experience of these solutions.
This is also heavily related to belief of a single-function system to solve all
possible collaboration issues. And this is related to poor implementation of onpremises solutions like Skype for Business, when actual solution might still
work as planned, but network issues make the end user experience something
totally different.
Rivalry between OS supporters
People tend to love sticking to what they feel as familiar. If someone is e.g.
used to using Slack, they might be so attached to it, that they feel
uncomfortable using e.g. Teams.
It's a personal opinion not based on facts. The "gut feeling" that Slack / Mac /
whatever is better than the Microsoft equivalent just because it's more familiar.
Haters gonna hate, it's the easiest not to concentrate on them on your projects.
Table 3 Negative attitudes towards Microsoft Appendix B.
In Figure 21 and Figure 22 the responses between end-users (Appendix A.) and
professionals (Appendix B.) can be compared. In comparison almost the same results are
evident except for Teams being perceived easier to use for professionals with experience.
This supports TAM 3 (Venkatesh and Bala, 2008) variable ‘Experience’.

Overall perceived ease of use amongst end-users was found to be relatively good. The
future for organizations in Finland will have the need to share the use-cases of the
personnel that are finding Teams easy to use and find the motivating factors to comply
with the employees that find Teams hard to use. More education for the ones that lack the
needed skills.

already moved the majority of employees in Finland to work remotely from home. To
evaluate the impact of Covid-19 on increased use of communications tools such as

11. Suggested model for companies implementing
Microsoft Teams
11.1 Pre phase
The first step of an implementation project could naturally start with a valuation of the
current situation and looking for potential alternatives. The first look towards the
implementation, could consist of a simple list of pros & cons for the implementation of
the new IS. Usually when looking into a new implementation there is a clear need that
needs to be fulfilled. In order to figure out the current state of satisfaction for the used IS
a survey could be used. When professionals were asked for the main reasons for
companies in Finland to implement Microsoft Teams they listed reasons such as hub for
teamwork, added transparency, modern and more reliable tool for conferencing / webinars
/ remote work, subsequent for SfB prior to its determination.
This first step could be done inhouse or with the help of consultants. Therefore, the first
step also includes asking for consultancy offers and interviewing/benchmarking these
offers to fit their own expectations. In a project a combination of multiple vendors might
be found useful whereas these vendors would need to perform by partly competing for
thrust and praise. Using professionals is important since the external consultants are living
and breathing change, they have enormous amounts of experience from previous projects
and they share information constantly with each other in industry-specific webinars,
meetups, and conferences.

11.2 IT-Setup
The IT-setup would include making sure of the compatibility of operative systems and
internet browsers. Potential investments in hardware or added security. The need for these
investments and updates would be drawn from an organization-wide mapping made by
for instance survey by the IT-department. Legacy system migration to the cloud, selecting
data that need to be migrated and a plan for the execution of the migration. Added security
for the cloud systems or in case of use on employee-owned mobile devices, the need for
79

Otto Vauhkonen
security applications. Once O365 licenses are sorted the Teams admin setup and creation
of rules for user-groups would be made. Internal network bandwidth shall be on a suitable
level for real-time media uploading and downloading. Microsoft provides the network
requirements on their webpage as listed in Table 4 (Microsoft, 2020)

Table 4 Bandwidth requirements

11.3 Planning phase and building the team
In the planning phase a consultant with prior experience to similar implementation
projects would work as advisor and orchestrator for the implementation. Implementation
team size would be dependent on the size and complexity of the organization. This team
would consist of people inside the implementing organization with help from external
consulting services like for instance: Digitalization consultants (specializing in Office 365
& Microsoft Teams), communications consultants (advising in channels for
communicating the change) and change management consultants for implementing the
new change of ways to work. The joint mission would be to form a clear view of how the
implementation could be organized, what goals would be set, how the journey would look
like, how long each step would take and how the budget will be distributed. The team
members would all be given their own areas to oversee. The implementation team would
need to be cross-organizational and cover multiple levels of the hierarchy. A project
sponsor and influential leader would also be essential to the success of the implementation.
Planning would include a timeframe and cost budget appraisal. Things to plan could be
80

Otto Vauhkonen
the pilot team and groups, a champions network, communications channels,
implementation brand (images, pictures, colors, and fonts) launch events and date,
merchandise, translation (if multilingual company).

11.4 IT-Governance
The creation of ownership for the Teams implementation includes the decision of making
the implementation company interest and finding the sponsors for the implementation.
Sponsors would preferably be influential leaders that can share the goal of using Teams
as an internal tool for collaboration. Getting the board of leaders involved.

11.5 Pilot phase and Champions program
Most Microsoft Teams implementation projects consists of a champion program. The
champions program is advised by Microsoft docs.microsoft.com (2018). The theory of
using a project champion has a long history, the way we speak of the project champion
has evolved quite a lot amongst the years (Pinto and Slevin, 1989). A champion suitable
for the implementation of Microsoft Teams would be a volunteer just as in an
organization’s work buddy system, but for the use of MS Teams. Champion would be
eager to drive change, modernize and add effectivity within the organization. The
motivation for volunteers should come from received recognition from the influential
leader involved in the Teams implementation team. A good amount of instructions is
available on the Microsoft web page (Microsoft, 2018).

11.6 Communicating the upcoming change
In order to prepare the organization for the upcoming change due to the implementation
the communication should be ongoing and reminding. By ensuring that the employees all
have the needed time to prepare for letting go of an old communications tool and start
using MS Teams, the transition will be smoother. One thing that professionals want to put
weight on is the importance of not only communicating the ‘what’ is going to change but
81

Otto Vauhkonen
communicating the ‘why’ it is going to change. In implementing new technology,
explaining the reason why it is important and providing concrete use cases to demonstrate
the usefulness can add perceived usefulness and uplift the image that the employers have
prior to use the IS.

11.7 Education
Educating the use of Teams is vital prior to the implementation of it in daily work tasks.
By giving the employees the opportunity to get familiar with the tools and giving them
the time needed, they will have a better chance to find the motivation for adopting to use
the tools. Providing a variety of use cases will add the chance that an individual employee
will be able to relate to the case and find motivation for use.
11.8 Teams launch (GO-Live Event)
The launch of MS Teams should preferably be done under one day. This would mean
gathering employees in a launch event where Teams would be declared ‘live’ and free for
the whole organization to use, here the work done in communicating the change would
bring benefit. If the communication part is executed in a way where the majority of
employees are looking forward to the change then the launch would be accordingly a
success.

11.9 Follow-up and continuous development
Microsoft is deploying new features for Microsoft Teams all the time. On top of new
features also new third-party applications and their corresponding features are evolving
constantly. To stay on track with new features & applications and adopt them in the daily
work tasks some effort and planning will be required. There is no such thing as one way
to implement or use a tool for internal communications such as Microsoft Teams. Any
team or department in an organization that wants to benefit as much as possible of a

82

Otto Vauhkonen
software shall do its best at sharing use cases, knowledge regarding new features and
anything else that can make work tasks more efficient using the software.
Organizations’ cannot have knowledge that is created inside them without individual
employees that build knowledge and unless these individual employees share their
knowledge it will not have a notable impact on the organizational effectiveness (Nonaka,
1991). Thus, the organization should put effort into creating a knowledge-sharing platform
within the organization in order to benefit from a higher level of effectiveness.

12. Discussion
12.1 Practical implications
From a practical perspective, the findings of this research reveal the most essential
variables that influence employees to adopt new technologies. By benchmarking several
widely discussed models, the use of the modern models is better applicable for supporting
management in leading change. The questionnaire results indicated that the level of
maturity of Teams use at organizations in Finland is still at an early stage and will require
more education, communication and knowledge sharing in order to reach a state where
only one main tool for communication exists. Implementation of software is an ongoing
process and requires specialist level knowledge.

12.2 Theoretical implications
In theory what the research indicated is that companies should always use external help
from professionals with knowledge for the specific information system that is aimed to be
used. In the case of a digital transformation project, the need for management consultants
with IT-knowledge is beyond the current understanding of the average organizational
management, although, most decisionmakers do include external help. For organizations
providing consultancy to their clients in change management or implementation of SaaS83

Otto Vauhkonen
products the question has clearly been the fear of rumors spreading of the company
outsourcing their implementation elsewhere thus, creating the question regarding real
competence. Change management is about an external eye for needed change, nondisclosure agreements will secure the secret to stay between the client and the vendor.

12.3 Future research
This research can be leveraged in future studies aiming to investigate the adoption of
communication technologies in organizations’. For future research an observative study
of technology acceptance and change towards new ways of working is proposed.
Organizations in Finland are in different stages in their digitalization and new information
systems to implement will occur on a faster time cycle than ever before. Focusing on
individual employees and their adoption would be extremely interesting.

13. Conclusion
By interviewing stakeholders working for Microsoft, the implementing company and
third-party consultants in different Microsoft Teams implementation projects, one thing
was clear: If you oversee an implementation project, you will see resistance and you will
get the question ‘why?’. Your task as the implementation lead will be to explain this ‘why’
and, by helping the employees to understand the need for change, also find the motivation
for how the implementation of new digital tools will be useful. To drive change is not an
easy task and one person or a small dedicated team will not be able to turn a whole
company. Thus, it is important to have all managers committed to the change, from lowlevel team leaders all the way to board members. Organizational change is like changing
the course of a big old ship, it requires all hands on deck.
Many would think that the implementation of a new ‘chat software’ is as easy as providing
the employees with user credentials and telling them to start using the software. That could
be the case if the software had only one or a few basic functions. For software that has
more functions and complexity, there will be a need of setting up structure and rules for
84

Otto Vauhkonen
use.
Discussions with consultants gave a clear picture of what a Microsoft Teams
implementation project is all about: Staying on the right course and keeping a good pace
compared to other companies in the global market.
Think of it as a need to stay in motion. This motion could be called, for instance,
digitalization and your company is a boat/ship (depending on size) that needs to survive
all big waves (new technology) in the ocean (global market). The better you implement
new technology the faster you can move in the ocean (global market) and the bigger your
ship (organization) is the stiffer it is to steer. If you have good communication and the
right tools you will attract the best crew, get most customers and make the biggest impact.
Then you will be a trendsetter and a vanguard.
The current situation globally, due to Covid-19 forcing people to stay at home, is
impacting Finland by significant measures. The decision of the Finnish Parliament to close
schools and advice on working remotely from home when possible led to financial
insecurity and, therefore, multiple companies went ahead and initiated co-operation
negotiations. These events might have made the average employee appreciation towards
their current employment rise slightly, since economic downturns reduce employee
intention to leave the organization (Hsu, 2009). Microsoft CEO Sataya Nadella spoke in
Microsoft Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call about the radical user
growth in daily active Teams users. Jared Spataro, Microsoft 365 Vice President wrote in
the company blog ‘2 years of digital transformation in 2 months’ and cited Sataya “In
April, we saw more than 200 million Microsoft Teams meeting participants in a single
day, generating more than 4.1 billion meeting minutes. Also, Teams now has more than
75 million daily active users and two-thirds of them have shared, collaborated, or
interacted with files on Teams as well.” (Spataro, 2020)

14. Swedish Summary - Svensk Sammanfattning
Mjukvara avgör till stor del det som vi kan åstadkomma i dagens värld under en arbetsdag
i kontorsuppgifter. En digital arbetsplats är något som möjliggör mer effektivt arbete;
understöder smidighet samt arbetstagarens engagering för arbetet; och utnyttjar
konsument-inriktad design och technologi. (Gartner, 2020). Organisationer i Finland och
även globalt, strävar efter att konstant hitta nya digitala lösningar för att stöda den
verksamhet de driver. Digitaliseringen är en tävling om vem som lyckas hålla sig bäst
bland toppnivån av företag som ständigt hittar gynnsamma teknologiska beslut för
framtiden. (Collin et al., 2015)
Syftet med denna avhandling är att ge läsaren en inblick i implementations projekt av ett
internt kommunikationsverktyg. Denna studie har Microsoft Teams som programvara i
fokuset. Närmare bestämt har studien finska organisationer i fokus, därmed även finska
organisationer med global verksamhet. Forskningsfrågor som denna avhandling försöker
besvara är:

1. Vilka är orsakerna och målen med implementeringen av Microsoft Teams?
2. Hur kan framgång av ett Microsoft Teams implementeringsprojekt mätas? Hur har
implementationen av Teams i finska organisationer lyckats enligt dessa mätare?
3. Vilka är stegen i ett Microsoft Teams implementeringsprojekt? Går det att
utnämna några specifika praktiks som leder till lyckade implementeringar? Vilken
typ av skolning gynnar slutanvändaren mest?

14.1 Teori
Modeller för förändringsledarskap
Prosci: ADKAR

86

Otto Vauhkonen
Prosci's ADKAR-modell är en akronym som består av orden medvetenhet (Awareness),
viljan (Desire), kunskap (Knowledge), förmåga (Ability) och förstärkning
(Reinforcement)
Medvetenhet
Medvetenhet är det första steget i implementeringen där uppgiften är att reda ut
affärsbehovet. I detta skede klargörs arbetarnas medvetenhet om den aktuella situationen.
Behov och önskemål för förändring i organisationen presenteras. Medvetenheten om
förändring kommer alltid att ha någon form av motstånd till en början, genom att göra
ständiga ansträngningar för att öka medvetenheten om behovet av förändring kommer
mängden motstånd att avta.
Viljan
Det andra steget i ADKAR är önskan, då medvetenhet av situationen och den kommande
förändringen är klargjord, är det dags att bygga på viljan att använda det nya
informationssystemet. Steget görs under koncept- och planeringsfasen, "Den anställdas
personliga motivatorer eller hinder bidrar till nivån av viljan att använda den nya
programvaran" (Prosci inc.)
Kunskap
Det tredje steget är att lära ut kunskapen om hur man ska göra för att förändra sina sätt att
arbeta. När medvetenheten och viljan har formats kan detaljerad kunskap delas ut. Ifall de
anställda skulle skickas på skolning utan medvetenhet eller vilja, skulle utbildningen
garanterat inte leda till det resultat som organisationen strävat efter. Steget för kunskap
innehåller instruktioner gällande användningen av informationssystemet. Kunskapssteget
görs under implementeringsfasen.
Förmåga
När kunskapen är på plats kan förmågan bemästras. Där kunskap handlar om att navigera
och lära sig anatomin av informationssystemet för lyckad användning, är förmågan
kunskap om att sätta i gång med att använda informationssystemet på ett sätt som är
87

Otto Vauhkonen
gynnsamt för de arbetsuppgifter som individen har. Detta steg tas under
implementeringsfasen precis som kunskap men inte förrän kunskapen finns till.
Förstärkning
Då de anställda har alla tidigare steg under kontroll, kan iterationen av användningsfall
och funktioner börja. Förstärkning handlar om att hitta nya sätt att använda verktyget och
förstärka användarna genom att följa användargruppernas specifika uppgifter och
användningsområden för informationssystemet. Genom att dela användarhistorier samt
konkreta exempel för användningen av informationssystemet och vidareutbilda anställda
i nya funktioner, kommer kunskapen att använda informationssystemet att växa.
Kunskapsarbete kommer att göras efter implementeringen, i den efterföljande
implementeringsfasen som antas pågå så långt i framtiden som informationssystemet
används.

Prosci: ADKAR-modellen är i mångsidig användning av Microsoft-konsulter i dagens
värld (Öppen personlig diskussion med Microsoft konsulter). Modellen är specifikt
utformad för digitala förändringsprojekt och är därför tillämpbar för implementering av
Microsoft Teams. ADKAR-modellen beskriver den enskilda anställdas anpassning till ett
nytt informationssystem. ADKAR-modellen är tydlig och enkel att använda och behöver
ingen komplex tillämpning beroende på din organisation. ADKAR är ett bra verktyg för
planering, implementering och uppföljning. Ju bättre en implementering planeras desto
bättre kommer den att lyckas, därför bör ADKAR uppmärksammas redan i
planeringsfasen för ett genomförande. Om implementeringen redan har påbörjat kan
ADKAR fortfarande ge viss insikt om nödvändiga ingrepp.

14.2Metod
Kvalitativ och kvantitativ forskning är de mest versatila metoderna för forskning. Att
kombinera delar av de två metoderna av forskning görs i så gott som all beteendemässig
forskning. (Newman och Ridenour, 1998)

88

Otto Vauhkonen
Metoder för insamling av data, såsom observationer, intervjuer, frågeformulär med öppna
svar, muntliga rapporter, dagböcker och diskursanalys är alla former av kvalitativ
forskning (Croker, 2009). Kvalitativ forskning bedrivs ofta i ett rum för intervju. Intevjuer
kan också hållas via telefon (Eriksson och Kovalainen 2008). I denna studie kommer ett
av valen för datainsamling att vara kvalitativa öppna intervjuer. Intervjuerna kommer att
hållas via telefonsamtal eller Microsoft Teams videosamtal. Intervjuerna fungerar som en
kunskapsgrund för att skapa enkäter riktade till konsulter och andra professionella som
arbetar med implementering av Microsoft Teams. Uppsättningen av personliga
diskussioner är kvalitativa data som presenteras i kapitel 5–7.
Kvantitativ forskning bygger på siffror och statistiska metoder. Metoderna söker
mätningar och analyser som kan vidare tillämpas av andra forskare. (King, Keohane och
Verba, 1994). En form av kvantitativa metoder som kommer att användas i denna studie
är frågeformulär. "Undersökning är en forskningsmetod som används för att få
information om vissa grupper av människor som är representativa för någon större
intressegrupp" (Berger, 2018).
För litteraturöversynen kommer ett urval av modeller för förändringsledarskap och
anpassningsmodeller att granskas. De valda modellerna inkluderar Proscis ADKARmodellen, Kotters åtta steg för att förändra din organisation, modeller för acceptans av ny
teknologi (TAM), teorin för motiverad handling (TRA), teori om planerat beteende (TPB),
nerspjälkade teorin om planerat beteende (DTPB) och modellen för motivation (MM).
Kunskapsdelning och lärande inom en organisation kommer att undersökas för att skapa
en förståelse för mervärdet utav samarbete.
Potentiella fördelar med att använda Microsoft Teams kommer att undersökas. Vissa
grundläggande funktioner för Microsoft Teams kommer att undersökas. Processen med
att lokalisera filer, arbeta i realtid, kontroll av version historik, transparens, intern
kommunikation, projektdrivarnas nätverk (eng. Project champion network) och SaaSsäkerhet kommer att utforskas.

89

Otto Vauhkonen
Förutom detta kommer data för denna studie att bestå av öppna diskussioner med
konsulter som arbetar kring implementeringen av Microsoft Teams. Användar-data från
en global finsk organisation kommer hjälpa att förklara hur en organisations
implementering av Microsoft Teams kunde se ut på ett numeriskt sett. En
slutanvändarundersökning kommer att delas ut i olika organisationer med målet att nå
användarna och utreda hur användarna av Teams ser implementeringen av programvaran.
