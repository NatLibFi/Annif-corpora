Abstract
Understanding the effects of crude oil spills is especially meaningful regarding the Baltic
Sea. This marine area is considered to be a high-risk zone for oil spills due to large amounts
of crude oil trafficking. Crude oil consists mainly of diverse hydrocarbons of which the
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are especially toxic for living organisms.
Exposure to crude oil has been documented to cause physical damages to body tissues,
intoxication, and acute death. Direct metabolic changes reflected by altered oxygen
consumption rates of model organisms, such as Daphnia magna, have also been observed in
prior research investigating the effects of exposure to crude oil-derived hydrocarbons. The
long-term impacts of this type of hydrocarbon exposure have not been investigated
extensively and lack of knowledge might cause a deficiency in risk assessments evaluating the
impacts of oil spills on the marine ecosystem of the Baltic Sea.
The purpose of this master’s thesis was, therefore, to examine possible long-term effects of
crude oil-derived hydrocarbon exposure on Daphnia magna. In the experiment, 48-houraged Daphnia magna in generation F0, were exposed to 30%-V, 10%-V and 0%-V
concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of crude oil for a 48-hour period. Oxygen
consumption rate and reproduction success of the exposed individuals were measured
following the exposure and the same parameters were monitored in two following
generations (F1 & F2) to see if the exposure-caused alternations that were carried over
generations. The filial generations were only monitored, not exposed to any hydrocarbons.
The most important result of the present thesis was that the individual oxygen consumption
rate in the heavily exposed population (30%-V) stayed homogenous and stable throughout
generations while the two additional populations (10%-V and 0%-V) showed unequal
variances and significant differences in the rates of individual oxygen consumption between
generations. These findings suggest that heavy hydrocarbon exposure derived from crude oil
could cause a reduction of variation that is carried over generations and indicate that events
such as oil spills could affect exposed populations throughout generations.

Svenskspråkig sammanfattning
Råolja är en icke-förnybar naturresurs som används i produktionen av många vardagliga
förnödenheter som bränsle och plast (Harayama et al. 1999). Råolja är en brännbar vätska
som består huvudsakligen av molekyler som byggs upp av kol och väte, dvs. kolväten
(Rudzinski & Aminabhavi 2000). Vissa kolväten, som bensen och andra aromatiska kolväten,
är giftiga för levande organismer, och således betraktas råolja som ett miljöskadligt ämne
(Almeda et al. 2014).
Råoljeutsläpp i miljön förekommer regelbundet till följd av olyckor eller likgiltighet
(HELCOM 2016). Risken för marina oljeutsläpp är speciellt stor i Östersjön eftersom trafiken
i dessa områden är livlig och försvåras av krävande farleder med grynnor och smala partier
(Suzdalev et al. 2014). År 2013 uppskattades det att 250 miljoner ton råolja samt av den
raffinerade produkter transporterades årligen över Östersjön (BRISK 2013). På grund av den
höga risken för oljeutsläpp är det viktigt att känna till möjliga effekter av oljeexponering i
länder med kust längs Östersjön.
Tidigare oljeutsläpp i Östersjön har ökat förståelsen av akuta effekter hos marina organismer
orsakade av råoljeexponering, men långtidseffekter har inte studerats systematiskt (Elmgren
et al. 1983). På grund av att långtidseffekterna av råoljeexponering inte är så utförligt
studerade, är betydelsen av oljeutsläpp för Östersjöns marina miljö svåra att bedöma. Målet
med detta examensarbete har varit att belysa möjliga långtidseffekter av exponering för
kolväten som härstammar från råolja och således bidra till kunskapen om möjliga
långtidseffekter av den här exponeringen.
Speciellt oljeutsläpp utgör ett hot för akvatiska miljöer eftersom det i form av ett hydrofobt
ämne sprider sig effektivt längs vattenytan (Harayama et al. 1999). Förutom detta, kan
naturkrafter som vågor bidra till att giftiga kolväten upplöses i vattnet (Albers 1995). Den
effektiva spridningen leder även till att ett lokalt spill påverkar ett omfattande område (EPA
1999). Den delen av olja som upplöses i en kolumn av vatten kallas för Water-solube
Fraction (WSF) och den består för det mesta av polycykliska aromatiska kolväten (PAH),
heterocykliska föreningar, resiner och asfaltener (Akaishi et al. 2004). I denna studie
tillverkades en syntetisk WSF enligt Martínez-Jerónimo et al. (2003) anvisningar för att
kunna efterlikna en naturlig kolväteexponering i samband med oljeutsläpp.
Metabolisk respons hos försöksorganismer har dokumenterats i samband med tidigare
experiment där organismer har blivit exponerade för kolväten som härstammat från råolja
(Christiansen et al. 2010). Eftersom största delen av alla metaboliska processer är
syreberoende, är förändringar i organismers individuella syreförbrukning en faktor som
speglar deras metaboliska respons (Kleiven 1992). Förändringar i reproduktionsframgång har
även blivit dokumenterade till följd av tidigare experimentella kolväteexponeringar (Geiger
& Buikema 1982). På grund av att både individuell syreförbrukning och
reproduktionsframgång verkade vara lovande parametrar för att mäta effekter av
kolväteexponering, utnyttjades dessa i denna studie.

I denna studie exponerades två populationer (F0) av Daphnia magna för två olika
koncentrationer av WSF (10 volymprocent WSF och 30 volymprocent WSF) medan en tredje
population förblev som en icke-exponerad kontrollgrupp. Exponeringsperioden av F0generationen började då individerna var 48-timmar gamla och räckte 48 timmar. Efter
exponeringsperioden mättes effekterna av exponeringen genom att följa med individuell
syreförbrukning (ṀO2) och reproduktionsframgång. Avkomman av de olika behandlade
populationerna vid F0-generationen studerades sedan likadant under två generationer (F1 &
F2) då de inte längre exponerades för kolväten som härstammade från råolja. Följande
generationer (F1 & F2) undersöktes för att se ifall exponeringen av föräldrarna i F0generationen hade orsakat förändringar som överfördes från föräldrar till följande generation
(transgenerationella effekter).
Daphnia magna är ett lämpligt försöksdjur då man vill forska i möjliga transgenerationella
effekter, eftersom kräftdjurarten ifråga förökar sig asexuellt i gynnsamma omständigheter (t
ex. laboratorium) (Kleiven et al. 1992). Asexuell reproduktion leder till att avkomman är
genetiska kopior av föräldrarna och till att eventuella individuella skillnader därmed snarare
borde bero på epigenetisk variation orsakad av miljöfaktorer än på variation som följd av
genetisk rekombination (Dukić et al. 2019). Alla individer i föräldragenerationen (F0)
härstammade från en enskild slumpmässigt vald individ av arten Daphnia magna och
representerade således samma genotyp. Förhållandena för de skilda populationerna i alla
generationer kontrollerades för att motsvara varandra i fråga om temperatur, ljus, pH och
näring. Endast exponeringsgraden till WSF varierade under exponeringsperioden mellan
populationerna i F0-generationen (kontroll, 10 volymprocent WSF och 30 volymprocent
WSF).
Resultaten i denna studie anger att varken den individuella syreförbrukningen eller
reproduktionsframgången i F0-generationen påverkades signifikant av varierande WSFexponeringsgrader, eftersom inga signifikanta skillnader observerades mellan individer med
olika exponeringsgrad (Kruskal-Wallis Test p> 0,05). Däremot hittades skillnader i
individuell syreförbrukning mellan populationer bland de följande generationerna, F1 och F2.
Individerna som härstammade från populationen som blivit utsatt för den kraftigaste kolväteexponeringen (30 volymprocent WSF) representerade betydligt högre syreförbrukning än
individerna som härstammade från den icke-exponerade kontrollpopulationen eller de
individer som härstammade från den mindre exponerade populationen (10 volymprocent
WSF) (pairwise comparison Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.000). Inga signifikanta skillnader i
reproduktionsframgång hittades mellan de olika populationerna inom de följande
generationerna.
Intressanta resultat erhölls då individuell syreförbrukning hos olika generationer inom varje
population jämfördes med varandra. Det framkom att alla generationer (F0, F1, F2) av den
kraftigast kolväteexponerade populationen representerade homogen individuell
syreförbrukning (Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances, F = 0,656, p = 0,523). Den
individuella syreförbrukningen förblev oförändrad mellan de olika generationerna
(independent samples Kruskal-Wallis Test, H = 3,537, p = 0,171). Alla dokumenterade
värden för syreförbrukning mellan olika generationer av den kraftigast exponerade

populationen förblev även inom normaldistributionen (Shapiro-Wilks p >0.05). Dessa resultat
tyder på att den kraftiga kolväteexponeringen förorsakade en sorts metabolisk stabilitet som
överfördes från den exponerade föräldragenerationen (F0) till följande icke-exponerade
generationer (F1 & F2).
Till skillnad från populationen som härstammade från de kraftigast exponerade individerna
visade både den mildare kolväteexponerade såväl som kontrollpopulationen heterogen
individuell syreförbrukning mellan de olika generationerna (Levene’s Test for Homogeneity
of variances, p = <0.001). Även signifikanta skillnader i individuell syreförbrukning kunde
observeras mellan olika generationer inom båda populationerna (Kruskal-Wallis p <0.05).
Vissa generationer representerade även värden av individuell syreförbrukning som stod
utanför normaldistribution (Shapiro-Wilks p <0.05). Växlande syreförbrukning tyder på att en
mildare exponering inte förorsakar likadan rigiditet som den kraftigare exponeringen.
En del av den använda syntetiska 30 volymprocent WSF-lösningen konserverades direkt efter
tillverkningen och en annan del av lösningen fick avdunsta i dragskåp under
exponeringsperioden i 48 timmar. Dessa sampel analyserades kemiskt i samband med
experimentet för att få en uppfattning om de kemiska komponenterna som försöksdjuren
exponerades för. Den totala kolvätehalten av lösningen nådde 3.6 mg/l i det direkt
konserverade samplet. Bara en bråkdel av kolvätena anses vara direkt giftiga för levande
organismer. En stor del av dessa giftiga molekyler hör till PAH-föreningar. Det visade sig att
PAH-halten i lösningen var 27 μg/l men minskade drastiskt till 1.9μg/l under avdunstningen.
I den syntetiska WSF lösningen var majoriteten av PAH-föreningarna naftalen men även små
mängder av fenantren, fluoren och acenaftylen hittades. Dessa giftiga molekyler är
lättflyktiga och avdunstar snabbt även i samband med oljeutsläpp som sker i naturen (Albers
1995).
Kolvätehalten i vattenkolumnen i samband med riktiga oljeutsläpp är svår att jämföra direkt
med experimentella kolvätehalter vid användning av syntetisk WSF, eftersom naturliga
omständigheter, som solljus, vågor, salinitet med mera i allmänhet påverkar mängden
upplösta kolväten i vattenkolumnen då oljeutsläpp inträffar. Dessutom påverkar storleken av
utsläppet och typen av olja mycket de molekylära komponenterna som upplöses (Wernersson
et al. 2004). Erhållna värden från vattenkolumnen i samband med riktiga oljeutsläpp går ändå
i samma riktning som den tillverkade syntetiska 30 volymprocent WSF-lösningens värden.
Till exempel Pécseli et al. 2003 erhöll halter från 0,641 till 12,833μg /l vid den danska kusten
i samband med en olycka där 2400 ton råolja rann ut i havet. De motsvarande värdena i
examensarbetet i fråga är troligen inte mycket högre än de som Pécseli et al. 2003
dokumenterade. Detta beror på att samplet av den syntetiska 30 volymprocent WSFlösningen i denna studie konserverades direkt, medan PAH-föreningarna fick fritt avdunsta i
samband med det riktiga spillet tills Pécseli et al. 2003 nådde olycksområdet. Ifall samplet av
den syntetiska 30%-V WSF lösningen i denna studie låtits avdunsta lika länge hade de
erhållna värdena antagligen varit rätt lika de Pécseli et al. 2003 erhöll.
Den observerade minskningen av variation gällande individuell syreförbrukning till följd av
en kraftig kolväteexponering kunde betyda att kraftigt exponerade individer och deras

avkomma inte lägre kan justera sin metabolism enligt förändringar i sin levnadsmiljö. Detta
är en intressant synpunkt som möjligen skulle löna sig att studera vidare för att underlätta
sammanställning av framtida riskbedömningar gällande marina oljeutsläpp i Östersjön.

1 Introduction
Crude oil is an important natural resource in the production of everyday products such as fuel
and plastics (Harayama et al. 1999). It is a flammable liquid mainly consisting of a mixture of
diverse molecules called “hydrocarbons” (Rudzinski & Aminabhavi 2000). Some of these
hydrocarbons are toxic to living organisms. Therefore, crude oil is considered hazardous to
the environment (Almeda et al. 2014). Crude oil is regularly spilled in nature as a result of
ignorance or accidents. Spills occur even though there are strict regulations considering crude
oil transportation, usage and disposal (HELCOM 2016). Especially aquatic environments are
vulnerable regarding oil spills. Crude oil spreads along the water column horizontally and
does not remain locally on the spill site (Harayama et al. 1999). This way the oil-affected area
becomes larger compared to spills on land and can harm considerably large areas in aquatic
ecosystems (EPA 1999).
In the Baltic Sea, the risk for marine oil spills is high due to heavy trafficking and challenging
shipping lanes. Hence, understanding the environmental impacts of oil spills in countries
located at the coast of the Baltic Sea is essential (Suzdalev et al. 2014). Diverse acute
consequences to living organisms have been observed previously after oil spills, but little is
known about the long-term effects of these events on organisms at spill sites (Elmgren et al.
1983). This thesis aims to investigate possible long-term effects by focusing on effects which
are passed over generations (transgenerational) following an aquatic crude oil hydrocarbon
exposure.
Three parental populations (F0) of Daphnia magna were reared and exposed to crude oil
hydrocarbons in the current study. Two types of hydrocarbon exposures were used, a light
and a heavy crude oil hydrocarbon exposure, also a control treatment where the individuals
were not exposed to any hydrocarbons was conducted. To expose the crustaceans for crude
oil hydrocarbons, a water-soluble fraction (WSF) of crude oil was prepared by diluting crude
oil in water, and this fraction was used as the source of hydrocarbons in the exposures. The
cultivation medium of the lightly exposed Daphnia contained 10%-V WSF and the medium
of the heavily exposed contained 30%-V WSF during the 48-hour exposure periods.

1

Selected parameters were measured from the exposed populations and the control population
after the exposure period to indicate possible effects of the hydrocarbon exposure. The
offspring originating from the differently treated parental populations (F0) were then studied
in the following two generations, F1 and F2, without exposing them to hydrocarbons. The
filial generations originating from different parental populations (10%-V WSF, 30%-V WSF,
control) were studied further to see if any possible effects of the original parental
hydrocarbon exposures could be seen in the offspring of the exposed populations indicating
transgenerational effects.
The parameters measured during the study were the individual oxygen consumption rate
(ṀO2) and reproduction success of the hydrocarbon-exposed Daphnia magna. These
parameters were chosen, since metabolic responses (Christiansen et al. 2010) and changes in
reproduction success (Geiger & Buikema 1982) have been recognized as acute consequences
of crude oil hydrocarbon exposures conducted in the laboratory. Metabolic responses are
generally reflected by changes in individual ṀO2, because metabolism is oxygen-requiring in
the long run. The metabolic activity and reproduction success of an individual are both also
ecologically important parameters associated with the overall fitness of an individual
(Kleiven 1992).

1.1 Oil spills in the Baltic Sea
Oil spills caused by intentional discharges have decreased significantly in the Baltic Sea
during the past decades due to effective aerial surveillance combined with substantial fines
and penalties (Aigars et al. 2011, Haapasaari et al. 2013). The governing commission of
Baltic Sea welfare, HELCOM (Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission - Helsinki
Commission), reported in 2016 that only 82 discharges were detected during aerial
surveillances in 2015 and that the amount of oil released was estimated to be less than 50 m3
during the entire year. This is a significant decrease in detections reported. The corresponding
number of oil releases detected in 1995 was documented to be 649 and the amount of oil
released during that year was estimated to reach almost 600 m3. However, it should be noted
that these numbers describe only the numbers of detected discharges in the Baltic area and
may give an imperfect picture of the situation. When inspecting the surveillance data
published by HELCOM (2016) one can, for example, notice that aerial surveillance over
Russian parts of the Baltic has been infrequent.
2

Due to the observed reduction of intentional discharges (Aigars et al. 2011, Haapasaari et al.
2013), the main risk of marine oil spills in the Baltic Sea is created by the possibility of
marine trafficking accidents. The report of Sub Regional Risk of Spill of Oil and Hazardous
Substances in the Baltic Sea (BRISK) (2013) estimated that over 250 million tons of crude oil
and fuels refined from crude oil are shipped each year over the Baltic Sea region. This
amount corresponds to 11% of all the crude oil, and related fuel, shipping on a global scale
(Brusendorff et al. 2012). Besides heavy trafficking, the Baltic Sea shipping lanes have many
shallow and narrow sections, underwater rocks and challenging weather conditions, such as
ice-coverage during wintertime. These factors lead together to the fact that the Baltic Sea is a
high-risk zone for marine oil spills caused by shipping accidents, such as groundings or
collisions (Haapasaari 2013). Oil platforms and terminals are also possible sources for
accidental oil spills in the Baltic Sea (Suzdalev et al. 2014). The Kravtsovskoye oil extraction
platform, located near the Curonian Spit, a UNESCO World Heritage site (Aigars et al.
2011), for example, has been reported extracting and transporting approximately 700 000
tons of oil yearly (Lukoil 2010). Several spills have already been registered to occur at this
platform, some of these notable in size (Suzdalev et al. 2014).
The estimated time interval for large scale oil spills, releasing more than 5000 tons of oil in
the Baltic Sea, has been estimated to be 26 years. However, the interval for smaller spills,
releasing 3000-5000 tons of oil, has been estimated to be merely four years (Brusendorff et
al. 2012). Ship traffic in the Baltic Sea has been expected to increase by 64% from the
situation in 2014 by the year 2020. The increase results from the construction of new Russian
oil terminals and the expansion of Lithuanian terminals at Klapeida and Butinge. Moreover,
the size of tankers is expected to grow, contributing to the possibility of significant oil spills
(Suzdalev et al. 2014).

1.2 Crude oil chemistry
Different crude oils vary in molecular composition depending on the source and origin of the
oil, but generally, 50-90% of the liquid consists of hydrocarbons (Jiang et al. 2010).
Hydrocarbons are a diverse group of different molecules that consists of a carbon (C) chain
and hydrogen (H) bound to the carbon core. Different hydrocarbons can vary to a great extent
in molecular weight and structure, giving them varying properties (Almeda et al. 2014).
3

Carbon and hydrogen together build electrically neutral, nonpolar molecules. The nonpolarity makes hydrocarbons hydrophobic. The hydrophobicity is one of the reasons why
crude oil creates a horizontally spreading slick on the water surface when spilled into aquatic
environments (EPA 1999). The nonpolar hydrocarbons are fat-soluble and many of them,
therefore, can penetrate the fatty-acid layer of a cell wall and cause cellular damage when
interacting with living organisms in aquatic environments (Sikkema et al. 1995). Nonhydrocarbon substituents of hydrocarbons increase the electrical polarity of hydrocarbons
and, thus, increase the solubility of hydrocarbons in the water column (Mannio et al. 2011).
The hydrocarbons which are considered as the most toxic components in crude oil are called
“Aromatic hydrocarbons”. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain at least one Benzene ring which is
the simplest aromatic compound. Approximately 1-20% of crude oil hydrocarbons belong to
the aromatic fraction (NRC 2003). Non-aromatic hydrocarbons are referred to as “Aliphatic
hydrocarbons” (Kang et al. 2014) and they are less toxic (Sikkema et al. 1995).
Benzene is a highly toxic circular molecule that consists of six carbon atoms (Philip 2013).
The structure of benzene contains special alternating single and double bonds between all the
carbons that make the molecular structure very persistent (Albers 1995). Benzene and other
compounds that contain one benzene ring bound with non-aromatic substituents are called
“monoaromatic compounds”. Benzene and three alkylated monoaromatic compounds,
toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, are found commonly in crude oil. These compounds are
generally referred to with the acronym “BTEX” due to their abundance in crude oil and
related substances (NRC 2003, Kang et al. 2014).
Molecules that consist of one, or more, benzene units are called “Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons” (PAHs). The PAHs consisting of two or three benzene rings are the most
common PAHs found in crude oil. As much as 90% of the PAHs present in crude oil usually
belong to this group of molecules (NRC 2003). Much like the monoaromatics, PAHs can be
substituted by various non-aromatic molecule groups. Naphthalene is the simplest PAH built
by two combined benzene structures and no substituents. The compound consisting of three
benzene structures and no substituents is called phenanthrene (Menon & Menon 1999).
Other, non-hydrocarbon, molecules found in crude oil are for example mineral salts, trace
metals, and organic molecules which are built of a hydrocarbon structure where other
elements, such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S), are incorporated. Well-known
groups of these complex organic molecules are resins and asphaltenes (Albers 1995).
4

Molecules containing other elements, apart from hydrogen and carbon, often possess a charge
and are, thus, water-soluble compared to pure hydrocarbons (Stanford et al. 2007).

1.3 Behavior of spilled crude oil in aquatic environments
When crude oil is spilled in the aquatic environment, the oil becomes modified by the powers
of nature. These physical modification processes are referred to as “weathering” (Wernersson
2004). Weathering happens, for example, when waves break the oil column and mix the oil
with water creating water-in-oil emulsions. This also dissolves crude oil molecules in the
water column (Albers 1995).
The molecules that dissolve to water are called “Water-soluble Fraction” (WSF) of the crude
oil (Martínez-Jerónimo et al. 2003). The WSF is a mixture of different crude oil components:
PAH-compounds, heterocyclic compounds, resins and asphaltenes (Akaishi et al. 2004). The
hydrocarbons dissolved in water are highly bioavailable and some of them very toxic for
aquatic organisms (NCR 2003). The quantity of hydrocarbons that dissolve in water after oil
spills vary considerably depending e.g. on weather conditions and sampling time. For
example, concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds (PAC) varied between 641 and
2833 ng/l at different sites on the Danish coast that were affected by a spill where 2400 tons
of heavy bunker oil was released in 2001 (Pécseli et al. 2003).
Together with the environmental conditions, such as pH and amount of sunlight (Wernersson
2004), the molecular composition of crude oil affects the outcome of weathering processes. A
significant fraction of the released hydrocarbons is usually evaporated within a couple of
days following an oil spill. Especially molecules having low molecular weights evaporate
effectively (Albers 1995). For example, in a 4.3 m3-sized crude oil spill in the North Sea,
more than 50% of the light hydrocarbons (<17C) were lost from the oil slick within 25 hours
(Gros et al. 2014). However, parts of the oil do not dissolve, but create small oil droplets
which are dispersed as free particles in the environment (Almeda et al. 2014). Complex PAH
compounds that do not dissolve easily in the water column, due to high hydrophobicity, can
also be absorbed in the bottom sediment (Menon & Menon 1999).

1.4 The effects of oil spills on the marine life of the Baltic Sea
Oil spills affect the living organisms in aquatic environments in various ways. Mortality is
caused by hydrocarbon toxifications, but also by a plain physical disturbance that the oil
causes. For example, seabirds and mammals lose the heat isolation of their coatings if
covered in oil. This, in turn, can lead to death caused by hypothermia (Hartung 1976). The
Baltic Sea is no exception regarding harmful consequences, as local mass deaths of oilcovered sea birds have been detected at the occasions of oil spills (Žydelis et al. 2006).
Investigations of the effects after local oil spills in the Baltic Sea have documented significant
reductions in the marine macrofauna populations. In October 1977, 1000 tons of fuel oil was
spilled in the Swedish archipelago, resulting in a drastic reduction of the macrofauna
abundance in the oil-contaminated observation site, only 16 days following the spill. Species
such as the amphipod Pontoporeia sp. and the polychaete Harmothoe sarsi vanished almost
completely from the macrofauna samples. The crash in population densities was, however,
recovered within the two following years (Elmgren 1983). Similar back and forth oscillations
in the population densities of macrofauna have been documented by several other case
studies regarding oil spills in the Baltic Sea (Bonsdorff 1981, Notini 1978). Population
oscillations following an oil spill could be caused by mass deaths following a hydrocarbon
exposure and thereby, small reproduction capacity of a reduced population or by a reduced
reproduction capacity of the individuals that remain alive following an oil spill (Rousi &
Kankaanpää 2012).
In addition to mass deaths, developmental and reproduction disturbances have been detected
in the case studies of Baltic oil spills. For example, the production rate of abnormal eggs
increased for the planktonic copepod Monoporeia affinis following a spill in the Swedish
archipelago (Elmgren 1983). The abundance of abnormal herring (Clupea harengus
membras) larvae also increased following a crude oil spill in 1987 on the Finnish coast where
5000-6000 tons of oil was released (Rahikainen et al. 2017).
Genotoxic effects of oil exposure have been documented, for example, in two oil spills at the
Butinge oil terminal, Lithuania. In November 2001, more than 10 tons of oil was spilled in
the sea at the Butinge terminal (Tracevskis & Bradley 2001). Micronuclei (MN) are small
fragments of DNA which are abnormally found outside the nucleus in cells. The high
occurrence of MN indicates a disturbed chromosomal division usually due to exposure to
6

genotoxic substances (Luzhna et al. 2013). In the Butinge terminal, the numbers of MN were
1.7-2.5 times higher two years after a spill in 2001 compared with an uncontaminated
reference site (Baršienė et al. 2006). Increases in MN of M. edulis cells were also observed at
the same site following an additional oil spill in February 2008 when 6.5 tons of crude oil
was spilled (Suzdalev et al. 2014). The frequency of MN was 5.6 times higher than the
reference value six months following the second oil spill, indicating quite long-lasting effects
of a single spill at individuals’ cellular level (Baršienė et al. 2012). Carcinogenic effects
caused by the genotoxicity of crude oil have been suggested to be one of the major long-term
effects of oil spills. The occurrence of carcinogenic effects in nature is challenging to monitor
systematically and, thus, the idea remains hypothetical (Bonsdorff 1981, Elmgren 1983).
Acute hydrocarbon exposures are not expected to create genetical differences between the
individuals, since genotoxic effects are associated with chronic hydrocarbon exposures,
lasting for months (Baršienė et al. 2006, Kreitsberg et al. 2010, Baršienė et al. 2012).
Oil spills have been shown to influence the metabolism and enzyme activity of animals living
in the Baltic Sea. For example, increased excretion of hydrocarbon metabolites was
documented in the harbor of Gothenburg, Sweden, when bile liquids of local eelpout
(Zoarces viviparus) individuals were analyzed for two weeks following a 10-100 ton oil spill
(Sturve et al. 2014). Living in brackish water demands metabolic adaptation of both
saltwater- and freshwater-originating species and creates an underlying metabolic stress for
the organisms living in the Baltic Sea. The release of crude oil-derived molecules in the water
column is increasing the metabolic stress of the living organisms, since the organisms must
detoxify many of the lipophilic substances penetrating the cell walls. Considering the high
basal rates of metabolic stress in Baltic fauna, pollution-caused metabolic stress can, thus, be
regarded especially challenging for organisms living in the Baltic Sea. An increase in the
metabolic rate due to oil exposures following spills could reduce the energy available for
other vital functions of organisms (Rousi & Kankaanpää 2012).

1.5 Toxicological effects of the Water-Soluble Fraction (WSF)
Effects of acute exposure to crude oil WSF have been investigated by several researchers in
laboratory experiments using many different organisms. Acute exposures to the sub-lethal
concentrations of hydrocarbons have been associated with the induction of many different
physiological responses in aquatic organisms, such as decreased heart rate or arrhythmia
7

(Lipschitz et al. 1982), increased rate of opercular movements in fish (Thomas & Rice 1975),
decreased swimming activity (Carls & Rice 1988) and even narcosis (Lari et al. 2016). Most
of the responses listed above have also been documented to recover within 24 hours in a
pollution-free environment (Thomas & Rice 1975, Lipschitz et al. 1982, Carls & Rice 1988,
Lari et al. 2016).
Some damage following acute exposure to hydrocarbons can, however, persist throughout the
life cycle of an organism. Life stages at an early age are considered the most vulnerable when
individual long-term effects following hydrocarbon exposure are considered. Exposures to
PAH compounds during embryonic development can cause severe physiological and
neurological malformations (Hodson 2017) and decrease the growth rates of the exposed
individual for a long time (Gilliers et al. 2012). Acute hydrocarbon exposure was, for
example, observed to depress the growth rate of Daphnia pulex and to cause a decrease in the
number of broods produced in a study by Geiger & Buikema (1982). These depressions were
significant in the exposures of phenanthrene in 0.36 mg/ L. The phenanthrene-exposed
animals also reached reproductive age approximately three days later than control animals.
The reductions were assumed to be caused by a depression in metabolic activity. Similar
results considering metabolic depressions after hydrocarbon exposure have also been
observed in the study by Crider et al. (1982). In their study, Daphnia magna was exposed to
stepwise increasing concentrations of a naphthalene solution. The exposure lasted 24 hours
and the ṀO2 was reduced by half at concentrations over 8 mg/l.
Decreased metabolic rates following hydrocarbon exposures have been documented also in
fish. Christiansen et al. (2010) investigated the effects of a crude oil WSF exposure on
immature, approximately three-year-old, polar cod (Boreogadus saida). The concentration of
PAH compounds during a 60 min exposure was 4.3 μg/ L and this type of acute exposure
caused the mass-specific ṀO2 to decrease by 58% when compared with control individuals.
The decreasing effects of a hydrocarbon WSF on metabolism have, however, not been
observed in all studies. For example, Geiger & Buikema (1981) did not find any significant
differences between the ṀO2 of exposed and non-exposed D. pulex when they studied
organisms that were exposed to varying concentrations of WSF. In a following experiment,
the same authors (Geiger & Buikema 1982) observed a contrasting effect following lifelong
chronic (< 0.6 mg/ L) naphthalene exposures. The prolonged exposure was documented to
increase the amount of offspring produced. Organisms exposed to low naphthalene
8

concentrations lived longer and reproduced earlier than the other studied groups. In light of
this observation, small enough concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons were assumed to
stimulate, not to depress, metabolism.

1.6 Aim of the study
The current study aimed to investigate the possible transgenerational effects of an acute (48
hours) crude oil-derived hydrocarbon exposure using the ṀO2 and reproduction success of D.
magna as parameters. Acute exposures have been suggested to mimic natural exposure-time
for water-living organisms following the events of oil spills (Lipschitz et al. 1982) since the
hydrocarbons are naturally diluted within a short time due to evaporation and other
weathering processes (Martínez-Jerónimo et al. 2003). The liquid containing the
hydrocarbons used in the exposure was prepared by mixing oil with water to simulate a
natural dissolution process resulting in a crude oil water-soluble fraction (WSF).
My interest was to investigate if individual changes, following an acute crude oil WSF
exposure, could be passed further to the offspring of the affected individual. The ṀO2 and
reproduction success were for this reason investigated by examining hydrocarbon-exposed
individuals (F0) and their offspring in two generations (F1 and F2). Three populations were
created for the study purpose: one population originated from heavily exposed (30%-V WSF)
parents, another population originated from lightly exposed (10%-V WSF) parents and one
from non-exposed parents used as controls.
The current idea, to investigate if transgenerational changes can be observed following an
acute crude oil hydrocarbon exposure, is inspired by research where no traditional genetic
changes are passed on between generations, rather the observed effects in offspring of
exposed individuals are generated epigenetically (Vandegehuchte et al. 2014). Daphnia
magna was selected as a model organism due to it being a well-studied cladoceran and a
commonly used test subject in ecotoxicological (Adema 1978, OECD 2004) as well as
epigenetic (Harris et al. 2011) research. Normally, D. magna reproduces asexually in
laboratory circumstances (Kleiven et al. 1992). The asexual reproduction leads to the
offspring being genetic copies of the parental organism (Harris et al. 2011). The genetic
variation between a parthenogenetic D. magna and its clonal offspring has experimentally
been proven to be very low by Dukić et al. (2019) who screened for genetic variation
9

between asexually generated clonal generations of D. magna. The assumption that genetic
variation between individuals would manipulate the results of an experimental exposure, such
as the one in question, can be reduced using one single D. magna to create a clonal
population of model organisms to be used in the experiment.
The study hypothesized that the ṀO2 and the reproduction success of the parental
populations would differ between the hydrocarbon-exposed groups and the non-hydrocarbonexposed control group since the hydrocarbon agents of crude oil have been recognized as
biohazards that alter the well-being of living organisms (Elmgren 1983, Carls & Rice 1988,
Rousi & Kankaanpää 2012, Rahikainen et al. 2017). Also, it was expected that these
differences might persist in the offspring of the differently treated parental populations
because transgenerational effects have been detected in preceding studies of hazardous
exposure (Vandegehuchte et al. 2014, Trijau 2018). The alternative that the changes would be
indicated by other than direct significant differences in the means of measured parameters
was also considered as a noteworthy alternative. For example, changes in variation without
changes in mean have been recognized as important responses following environmental
contamination (Nikinmaa & Anttila 2019).
Indications of transgenerational effects would mean that an acute hydrocarbon exposure
following an oil spill can affect the well-being of marine organisms in a longer perspective
than a single individual life cycle. This point of view is not often considered in risk
assessments regarding Baltic Sea oil spills (Rousi & Kankaanpää 2012). Finding the evidence
of transgenerational effects would also motivate further investigations of possible epigenetic
changes following a crude oil hydrocarbon exposure, since epigenetic changes have already
been associated with other PAH-exposure (Weis et al. 1998, Huang et al. 2016).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Laboratory preparations and experimental animals
A stock culture of D. magna was received on 8th June 2017 from the Laboratory Centre for
Ecotoxicology and Risk Assessment of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE)
(Jyväskylä, Finland). After the arrival, the daphnids were cultivated at the University of
Turku in a laboratory of the section of Physiology and Genetics. The cultivation was done in
a 7.5L glass aquarium provided with an air stone and filled with the growth medium M7
(Appendix 1). The growth medium had been prepared following the instructions of the
OECD Guideline for testing of chemicals (OECD 2004).
The photoperiod of the laboratory was fixed on 16 h light and 8 h dark. The light bulbs used
were OSRAM Relax 15W 2700 K (Ledvance, Augsburg, Germany). The room temperature
was controlled to be within the range of 18–22 °C by measuring the temperature of the M7 in
the cultivation aquarium of the daphnids. The measurements were carried out using a
handheld meter pHenomenal® OX4100H (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, U.S.). The same
meter was used to measure the oxygen saturation of the M7. The oxygen saturation was
controlled to be above 86% of air saturation (Limits for normoxic conditions following Seidi
et al. (2005)). The pH of the medium in the aquarium was monitored twice a week with a
Tetra® pH test (Tetra Fish, Melle, Germany) and maintained within 7.0–7.5. The cleanness
of the aquarium was controlled during the measurements and the aquarium was replaced
when needed. The daphnids were fed by adding algal Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata
(Appendix 2). The algae were added to the aquariums three times a week, so the M7 held a
green color throughout the cultivation.
For creating a genetically similar lineage of daphnids, one full-grown individual was
randomly chosen from the stock aquarium on 16th June 2017 and transferred into a separate
aquarium where it could reproduce freely. The conditions regarding nutrition, light, pH, and
temperature were adjusted as for the stock aquarium. All the individuals used in experiments
originated from this aquarium, which had the clones of the chosen mother individual.
11

The animals in this experiment were always transferred carefully using clean Pasteur pipettes.
daphnids were individually collected by sucking them up from the original location and
releasing them into the desired location. On occasions, when a specific number of daphnids
of specific age were replaced, the individuals were released from the pipette on a FALCON®
40 µm cell-strainer (Corning Inc., Corning, New York, U.S.) that was submerged in the
growth medium in the location of placement. The filtering of growth medium along the study
was also conducted by letting the M7 run through a FALCON® 40 µm cell-strainer into
sterile beakers, repeatedly for three times before pouring the filtered medium to the desired
location.

2.2 Pilot experiments
A series of pilot experiments were conducted to determine the most suitable design for the
study of the transgenerational effects. The intention of the first pilot experiment (paragraph
2.2.1) was to verify the age that daphnids started to carry eggs in the present laboratory
conditions to avoid exposing the eggs to the WSF. Exposing the eggs to hydrocarbons could
affect the developing embryo negatively (Incardona et al. 2004) and, thus, skew the ṀO2 or
reproduction success in generation F1. However, it should be noted that avoiding the
exposure of visible eggs is not ensuring that the individuals in the F1 generation were not
exposed to hydrocarbons as primordial cells (Trijau et al. 2018) and therefore the F1
generation cannot be considered as strictly unexposed.
The second pilot was about determining a suitable age for the model organisms (paragraph
2.2.2). Newborn daphnids are sensitive and might suffer damage when transferred from an
aquarium to another (Hoang & Klaine 2007) and, thus, a lower limit for handling daphnids
was determined. The second pilot was conducted to avoid the situation where the dysfunction
of the studied organisms could have been caused by the study process itself, rather than the
exposure to hydrocarbons.
The purpose of the third pilot experiment was to monitor mortality and the ṀO2 of D. magna
following exposure to different concentrations of a WSF derived from crude oil (paragraph
2.2.3). The ideal concentration would be non-lethal for the daphnids, but significantly
affecting the ṀO2 so that a clear effect of the exposure was indicated.
12

2.2.1 Maturity for carrying eggs
The individuals for this experiment were obtained by transferring one parental individual to a
500 mL beaker where it reproduced for 24 h and was removed afterward, so no new
individuals were born to the aquarium. The age of the born offspring was defined as 24 h
when the parent was removed. Five individuals were selected from the brood for analyzing at
which age the daphnids reach reproduction maturity. These individuals were studied during
24hour intervals until each individual had developed visible eggs and the individuals could be
interpreted as mature for reproduction.
Individual offspring was studied by dropping the individual on a microscope slide glass with
a Pasteur pipette and examine the individual with an Olympus SZ-CTV microscope
(Olympus, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan), using magnification 2.0. After the examination, all the
individuals were returned to the original beaker until another 24-hour interval had passed and
the next examination began. The day when individuals started to carry eggs was noted and
determined the endpoint of the observation period.
All the individuals displayed visible signs of maturation on the fifth day of the observations,
since clear formation of eggs could be spotted in the posterior cavity of the body. The age of
five days was, thus, defined as the absolute end of exposing the individuals to crude oil
hydrocarbons.

2.2.2 Tolerance of experimental procedure-related stress
Two groups of different-aged daphnids were raised to examine differences in stress tolerance
between age groups. The older group was generated 24 hours before the younger group by
transferring one full-grown individual from the parent aquarium into an unoccupied 7.5L
glass aquarium filled with M7 growth medium and algae. After the individual had been in the
aquarium for 24 hours, all newborn daphnids were caught by filtering the M7 through a
sterile cell strainer. The caught individuals were transferred into a 300 mL beaker filled with
200 mL of growth medium filtered from the aquarium where the offspring were born. The
mother individual was transferred into a new aquarium and left there for another 24-hour
period. The 24 hours younger clutch was similarly caught and transferred into a 300 mL
beaker. Twenty individuals from each age group (24 hours and 48 hours) were then
transferred into new beakers representing a simulated WSF solution, containing 250 mL fresh
M7 medium and 250 mL filtered medium from the aquaria were the individuals originated
from.
13

The transferred daphnids were left to acclimatize into the new environment for 48 hours (this
corresponds to the time of WSF exposure in the experiment investigating transgenerational
effects). After 48 hours the mortality in the different groups was documented and compared
to find out possible sensitivity to transfer or environmental change-related stress. The
number of dead individuals in each treatment was compared with the original number of
living individuals (20) by division and this product represented the percentage of mortality in
each treatment.
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑠
× 100% = 𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒
𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑠

The group of younger daphnids (24 h) was clearly found to be more sensitive to transfer and
environmental change-related stress. The mortality percentage was 25% in the younger
group, since five individuals were found dead after the treatment. Only one was found dead
in the group of older daphnids (48 h), resulting in a 5% mortality percentage. Therefore, 48hour-old individuals were used for further exposures. Considering these requirements, the age
of the exposed daphnids would be below the age defined for maturation (Paragraph 2.2.1).

2.2.3 Determination of suitable WSF exposure concentration
On the starting day of an experiment, a set of 20 full-grown individuals were transferred in a
7.5L aquarium filled with M7 and algae for reproduction. After 24 hours, the full-grown
individuals were removed from the aquarium using a strainer. All newborn individuals in the
aquarium were transferred back to the aquarium and left to grow for 24 h, before the
beginning of the exposure.
The preparation of a 100%-V WSF liquid began two hours before the newborn individuals
were separated from the parental individuals (see Appendix 3 for detailed preparations).
Briefly, 100 g of crude oil (Russian Export Blend medium crude oil, Neste Oil, Naantali,
Finland) were mixed with 900 mL of fresh M7 for 24 h, where after the water fraction was
collected. The watery fraction was considered as 100%-V WSF. The test liquids used in
exposures were prepared immediately after the 100%-V WSF liquid was collected. A fresh
100%-V WSF was prepared for each experimental set. The finalization of the test media
lasted approximately 2 hours and the full 24 hours of the maturation period was completed
during this time, resulting in 48-hour-aged individuals.
14

The test liquids were prepared from the 100%-V WSF in a fume hood into 1000 mL beakers
by measuring and mixing assigned volumes of the freshly prepared WSF and M7 medium
filtered from the stock aquarium. The control liquid was prepared like the WSF containing
test liquids except that no 100%-V WSF liquid was added. Instead of adding WSF to the
control treatment, a defined volume of fresh M7 medium was added to stimulate an
environmental change corresponding to the replacement of M7 with WSF.
For the first set of pilot experiments, a control, a 50%-V, a 30%-V, and a 10%-V WSF liquid
were prepared. For the second set of pilot experiments, a control, a 10%-V, 15%-V, and a
20%-V WSF liquid were prepared (Table 1).
Table 1 The assigned volumes of WSF and M7 medium used to create different concentrations of WSF to the exposure liquids. The final
volume of each test-liquid was 500 mL. The entire M7 medium, except the fresh M7, used was filtered from the aquarium where the test
organisms were stored before the start of the exposure. Fresh M7 was added to the control treatments to stimulate similar stress caused by
the environmental change that was caused by the addition of the 100%-V WSF liquids to the exposure liquids.

Clean air stones were added to each beaker with test liquids. The flow of air was fixed to a
modest level so that only small bubbles were popping up to the surface of the test liquid, but
no intense water movement was observed. Twenty daphnids (48 h) were transferred to each
WSF exposure solution with strainers. The adding of daphnids to all the test liquids was
performed within a 15-minuteperiod. The individuals were left to the beakers for a 48-hour
exposure period in a fume hood where the light period was fixed as previously. The
temperature in the hood was not manipulated but followed the room temperature. No pH
adjustments were performed on the final test liquids and algae were not added to the test
liquids during the exposure period.
After the exposures, the ṀO2 and mortality in each group were calculated. The ṀO2 was
calculated using ten individuals from each treatment. The measurement was conducted with a
Loligo® 24-channel optical fluorescence, oxygen-sensing microplate (Loligo systems,
Viborg, Denmark) connected with sensor dish® reader (SDR) (Presens Precision Sensing
15

GmbH, Resenburg, Germany). The Loligo® microplate had 24x80 μL measuring chambers
where individual daphnids could be placed to measure the individual ṀO2 within each
chamber. The measurements of ṀO2 were performed in two lots, since the total number of
the daphnids to be studied exceeded the number of the chambers available. In each
measurement, a set of four chambers were left empty to control for any background effects on
the ṀO2.
A volume of 85 μL of fresh oxygen saturated M7 was pipetted to each measurement chamber
20 minutes before the daphnids were placed in the chambers. The freshly prepared M7 had
been saturated with oxygen in a batch of 30 mL by enclosing the liquid in a 50 mL falcon
tube and shaking the tube vigorously for 2 minutes. After the shaking, the cap was released
and the M7 was left standing within the tube until used.
The daphnids were rinsed from algae and the test liquid before placing them in the chambers
by submerging the individuals twice in fresh M7. The rinsed individuals were transferred to
Loligo® oxygen-sensing microplate so that one individual from each test solution was placed
on the plate in alternative order so that individuals from each solution would spend about
equal time on the plate before measurement (5 individuals per WSF treatment per
measurement set). After transferring daphnids to chambers, the outlets of the chambers were
sealed with approximately 0.7×0.7 cm square pieces of Parafilm M (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, Missouri, US) with clean tweezers. No air bubbles were left between the Parafilm M
and the M7 in the chambers. A silicon panel and a weight were carefully placed on the
microplate and the measurement system was covered with black plastic bags before the
measurement was started.
The measurements were done with SDR v4.0.0 software (PreSens, Resenbourg, Germany)
and for the software temperature, air pressure, chamber volume and the desired measurement
interval (for the first set of the experiment once per 3 minutes, but in all the rest of the
measurements once per minute) were set for each measurement. The temperature of M7 was
measured with HI 145 Digital Thermometer (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, Rhode Island,
U.S.). The current air pressure was obtained from the Finnish Meteorological Institute by
checking the local air pressure of the weather station nearest to the University of Turku
(Artukainen, Link 1).
The ṀO2 was read until air saturation inside the chambers decreased to 50%-V. The daphnids
were removed and the microplate was rinsed between the measurements first with hot tap
16

water, then with filtered milli-Q water and last with fresh M7. The plate was then dried by
vigorous shaking. The next set of individuals were then measured as described above. A
waiting time of 10 min was implemented before adding the daphnids.
The sample sizes of different groups were equal in the two sets of pilot experiments (10
individuals measured) except for the 15%-V WSF exposure were individual daphnids had
adhered on the glass walls of the beaker. This disturbance caused the death of 11 individuals,
therefore, the ṀO2 was measured only from nine individuals.
The remaining individuals alive in each beaker were counted after conducting the ṀO2
measurements. The mortality rate was calculated as before (paragraph 2.2.2).
The reported percentages for the 50%-V WSF exposure and the 30%-V WSF exposure
originate from the first set of the pilot experiments and the reported percentages for the 20%V WSF exposure originate from the second set of the pilot experiments. The 10%-V WSF
exposure and the control treatment were performed in both experimental sets and the
mortality percentages reported by the results are based on the average of these values (See
Results, Paragraph 3.1). Due to a problem in the procession of the 15%-V WSF exposure, the
percentages reported originate from a separately conducted mortality test that was
accomplished after the two first sets of pilot experiments, but still following the same
scheme.
Suitable concentrations of the WSF to be used in the actual WSF exposures were determined
based on the mortality within the different concentrations of WSF. This choice was made
since no statistically significant effects of the hydrocarbon exposures in the two sets of pilot
experiments could be seen when comparing the ṀO2 of the exposed animals and the control
treatment of each set (see Results, Paragraph 3.1.2).
The 10%-V WSF exposure was not observed to cause mortality in relation to the control
treatment. Due to this, 10%-V WSF exposure was selected to represent a low-concentration
exposure causing no mortality in the experiment investigating transgenerational effects. The
30%-V WSF exposure was chosen to represent a more harmful exposure, since this treatment
caused up to 50% mortality in the pilot experiments. (Results 3.1, Figure 1).
The temperature during the measurement of the first experiment 06.07.2017 was 19.8 °C and
air pressure 1013 hPa. The temperature during the second measurement 20.07.2017 was 20.2

17

°C and air pressure 1014 hPa. See Appendix 4 for the illustrated temperature curve
throughout the experimental period of pilots and the main experiment.

2.3 Transgenerational effects of WSF exposure
All the procedures in final WSF exposures were done similarly as in pilot experiments. The
WSF concentrations for exposures were 0%-V (control), 10%-V and 30%-V as determined in
paragraph 2.2.3. The number of daphnids used in exposures is given in Table 2. Four batches
of the 100%-V WSF solution were prepared for the final experiments following Appendix 3.
Also, a chemical analysis of the exposure liquid was performed on a 30%-V WSF sample
following Appendix 3. The exposures were conducted using 7.5L aquaria. The ratio of
animals per volume of test medium was kept the same as in the pilot experiments (20
dapnids/500 mL of test medium) and the needed volumes of test media were counted using
this ratio (Table 2).
Table 2 The volumes of 100%-V -WSF and M7 medium used to create a total volume of a 10%-V and a 30%-V WSF exposure medium are
presented on separate rows. No WSF was added to the control treatment. Also, the number of daphnids designated for each treatment is
presented on the uppermost row.

The aquaria were placed in a fume hood and clean air stones were added to each aquarium.
The daphnids were transferred to each aquarium with a strainer. The start of the exposure was
the point when all the aquariums had received age selected (48 h, like Paragraph 2.2.3)
daphnids. The exposure period was 48 hour long.

2.3.1 Measuring the ṀO2 of the exposed F0 individuals
Measurement of individual ṀO2 of the exposed daphnids begun immediately after the
exposure period had finished. The measurements were done as in the pilot experiment but
using 21 individuals from each differently treated population. Therefore, the measurements
were conducted in three sub-sets. During each measurement, the ṀO2 of seven individuals
from each population was measured. Three measurement chambers were left empty to control
for possible background effects on the ṀO2. The transferring of daphnids to the cambers was
performed as previously.
The temperature during the measurement of the F0 generation 21.08.2017 was 21.4 °C and
air pressure 1012 hPa. See Appendix 4, Figure 4.

2.3.2 Transferring F0 daphnids for further reproduction and collecting the
offspring representing F1 generation
Twenty individuals were picked randomly from the remaining individuals in the exposure
tanks and the control population. The chosen 20 individuals per population were transferred
into three separate 900 mL glass beakers filled with fresh M7, provided with algae and air
stones. The beakers were placed in the same fume hood where the exposures had been
conducted. The individuals in the beakers were let to mature and reproduce for 11 days. The
number of born offspring per day was recorded during this period.
The number of offspring was recorded by filtering the water from a beaker through a cell
strainer to an additional 900 mL beaker and counting the number of newborn animals caught
in the net. After all the individuals had been caught within the cell strainer it was dipped into
a 300 mL glass beaker containing fresh M7 so that the caught daphnids were released into the
liquid. The parental individuals were further transferred into the 900 mL beaker containing
the filtered M7 from the maturation beaker. The offspring in the smaller beaker were
discharged. This routine was repeated during the maturation period at 24-hour intervals.
The clutches born on the 11th day of the maturation period were caught and counted, but the
offspring were not discharged before 50 individuals representing the offspring of each
population were collected representing 24-hour-aged daphnids. The chosen offspring were
transferred into three new 900 mL beakers provided with air stones, fresh M7 and algae and
let to grow in these containers, representing generation F1. The parental organisms (F0) were
discharged.

2.3.3 Measuring the ṀO2 of the F1 and F2 individuals and documenting
their reproduction success
The newborn individuals in the beakers were let to grow an additional 72 hours in the
beakers, beakers, so the age of 96 hours was reached by the F1 individuals. The age of 96
hours equaled the age when the ṀO2 of the exposed parental organisms in the F0 generation
had been measured. Measurement of ṀO2 of 21 individuals per population was performed in
three sub-sets on the F1 individuals as previously done for the parental F0 individuals.
Since the possible influence of the temperature on the ṀO2 had been noticed during the pilot
experiment, temperature adjustments were done 12 hours before starting the measurement so
that the temperature was fixed to what it had been during the measurement of the first
generation. The temperature was fixed by heating the laboratory with an electric radiator and
observing the temperature change with a handheld HI 145 Digital Thermometer (Hanna
Instruments) from a 50 mL Falcon tube containing a fresh M7 medium.
The temperature during the F1 generation measurement 04.09.2017 was 21.8 °C and air
pressure 1012 hPa. The temperature during the F2 generation measurement 19.09.2017 was
21.4 °C and air pressure 1010 hPa. See Appendix 4, Figure 4.
After the ṀO2 measurement was completed 20 remaining individuals from each beaker was
further transferred into three new 900 mL glass beakers supplied as previously. Overlapping
daphnids were discharged. Twenty individuals in each beaker could mature and reproduce for
one day more than the previous generation since the needed clutch size was not reached on
the 11th day. The number of born offspring was recorded following the same 11-day period
and 24-hour interval as in the F0 generation.
Fifty individuals representing the second-generation offspring (F2) from each population
were collected on the 12th day and transferred into three new 900 mL beakers and left to
grow for 72 hours as previously. The excess organisms were discharged. The ṀO2 of 21
individuals from F2 generation per each beaker was recorded when these individuals had
reached the age of 96 hours. Temperature adjustments were done similarly as in the F1
generation. After the measurements, 20 individuals from each beaker were further transferred
into 900 mL maturation beakers for the reproduction success observation of F2. The
reproduction was observed following the 24-hour interval for 11 days.

2.4 Mathematical treatment of the ṀO2
The SDR reader measures the amount of oxygen present in the Loligo ® microplate chambers
using an optical fluorescence oxygen sensing technology. A sensor measures the phase angles
of light penetrating the microplate chambers with set intervals. The phase angle is dependent
on oxygen saturation (Link 2). The phase angles for the M7 medium in the chambers were
documented by SDR v4.0.0 (Presens Precision Sensing GmbH, Resenburg, Germany)
software. The documented phase values at each measuring point were transformed into ṀO2
using the Microplate analysis tool v1.0.0 provided by Loligo® Systems.
The analysis tool is based on a Stern-Volmer (S-V) equation for defining oxygen
concentration in percentages. In the equation, the phase angles of oxygen-free water are
divided with the measured phase angle in the medium at a certain measuring point. The ratio
of the phase angles is then used to count the oxygen content in the chamber at the measure
point by dividing it with the S-V constant added with one (see equation below). The S-V
constant is a value within the analysis tool possessed by Loligo®.

The used phase angle of oxygen-free water was 54.45 °. This value was originating from a
calibration dataset for liquids at 25 °C, received from Loligo®-software team.
The values for percent air saturation counted with the Stern-Volmer equation were plotted by
time for each chamber. Only the values from 95% to 70% of air saturation were used in
calculations. Values measured during the first 180 seconds, when the daphnids were in the
chamber, were discharged from the analysis of the ṀO2 in the experiment where
transgenerational effects were studied. A wait-time was not implied to the analysis of the
ṀO2 of the pilot experiments. An ṀO2 slope, describing the individual oxygen consumption
in each chamber by O2/individual/min, was transposed by the analysis tool provided by
Loligo® Systems. These slopes were used to compare individual ṀO2 between different
groups and generations in the statistical analysis of data. Unsuccessful measure results were
21

excluded from the analysis and this reduced the sample size in some of the analyses
(Appendix 4, Table 9).

2.5 Statistics
The analysis software IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, U.
S.) was used in all the statistical treatments of the data. The data sets were always checked for
homogeneity with Levene’s test for variance and a Shapiro-Wilks test was used to check for a
normal distribution within the groups within each data set.
If the p-values of the two tests listed above were non-significant (>0.05), the assumptions of
homogeneity and normal distribution were not violated and a One-way Analysis of Variance
(One-way ANOVA) was used to analyze differences between the ṀO2
(picomoles/individual/ min) within the different populations. In cases where the analysis was
showing a p-value <0.05, and expressing a significant difference between the populations, a
post-hoc Tukey test was conducted.
In cases where the data set was not found homogenous or normally distributed the
comparisons of the grouped values were completed with a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test.
In cases where the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was indicating a p-value <0.05, and so
expressing a significant difference between the populations, a pairwise Kruskal-Wallis
comparison was performed.
The differences in ṀO2 between the common treatment (the 10%-V -WSF) of pilot
experiments were analyzed with a One-Way ANOVA and a Post Hoc Tukey-test. The
populations (50%-V WSF, 30%-V WSF, 10%-V WSF and control) of the first set of pilot
experiments were compared with each other and the populations (20%-V WSF, 15%-V WSF,
10%-V WSF and control) of the second set of pilot experiments were compared with each
other. Both comparisons were performed using a One-Way ANOVA.
The results of the main experiment were compared in the inter-generational and
transgenerational ways. In the inter-generational comparison, Independent Samples KruskalWallis test was used to compare the different populations within each generation (each
generation: F0, F1, and F2 tested separately). In the transgenerational comparison, the
independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the differences between
22

generations within each population (30%-V WSF, 10%-V WSF, and control tested
separately).
The number of born daphnids per day was compared between the populations within each
generation with Kruskal-Wallis (inter-generational comparison only). Different generations
were not compared with each other.

3 Results
3.1 Pilot experiments
3.1.1 Comparison of the corresponding treatments in the two sets of pilots
According to Levene’s test (F = 0.123 p = 0.730), the variances in the ṀO2 of daphnids were
equal between both the first and second 10%-V WSF pilot experiments conducted. The
normal distribution was also confirmed in both set values by a Shapiro-Wilks test p > 0.05.
The conducted One-Way ANOVA indicated that the ṀO2 significantly differed between the
first and the second set of 10%-V WSF performed (F = 7.233, p = 0.015). The ṀO2 of
daphnids of the second set was 65.3% higher in comparison with the daphnids from the first
set of pilot experiments.

3.1.2 Comparing ṀO2 between treatments in the first set of pilot
experiments
The first set of pilot experiments included 50%-V, 30%-V,10%-V WSF exposure, and the
control treatment where 50%-V of the filtered M7 was replaced with a fresh medium. The
ṀO2 data within each treatment was normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks p > 0.05) and
variances were equal between the treatments (Levene’s test F = 2.199, p = 0.105). One-Way
ANOVA did not show significant differences (F = 2.532, p = 0.072) between ṀO2 of
individuals exposed to different concentrations of WSF or the control M7. The average ṀO2
recorded in the treatments are shown in figure 1, paragraph 3.2.5.

3.1.3 Comparing ṀO2 between the treatments in the second set of pilot
experiments
The analyzed treatments of the second set of pilot experiments included the 20%-V, 15%-V,
10%-V WSF exposures, and a control treatment where 20%-V of the filtered M7 was
replaced with fresh medium. The ṀO2 data was normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks p >
0.05) in all other populations except the 15%-V WSF (Shapiro-Wilks F = 0.792 p = 0.019)
and variances were equal between the populations (F = 1.817 p = 0.162). IndependentSamples Kruskal-Wallis Test did not show significant differences (F = 2.589, p = 0.460)
between the ṀO2 of the individuals exposed to different consecrations of WSF control24

treated individuals. The averages of the recorded ṀO2 are shown in figure 1, paragraph
3.2.5.

3.1.4 Mortality observed in the different WSF exposures
The mortality percentages from each exposure concentration are shown in figure 1 together
with the means of the recorded ṀO2. The highest mortality was observed in the 30%-V WSF
exposure, where 50%-V of the exposed daphnids were dead after the 48-hour exposure
period. The observed mortality pattern in both conducted 10%-V WSF exposures and the
control treatments was the same. Mortality kept rising stepwise at higher WSF
concentrations.

Figure 1 The average values of the ṀO2 rates in the first and second sets of pilot experiments are shown with
the grey and black lines. The values of ṀO2 are shown on the left-side Y-axis. The mortality is presented by the
red line and the mortality percentages are shown on the right-side Y-axis. WSF concentrations of each
measurement point are given on the X-axis. N=10 per ṀO2 measurement, except the 15%-V WSF where the
N=9. N=20 in observation of mortality.

3.2 Chemical analysis of the 30%-V WSF samples
The chemical analyses of the 30%-V WSF solution showed that the total amount of PAH-compounds
decreased 93%-V from the sample that was immediately conserved to the sample that was conserved
after the 48-hour evaporation period. The documented concentrations of PAH’s can be seen in Table
3. Most of the singularly detected PAH-compounds had decreased below the detection levels in the
latter conserved sample, only naphthalene being detectable as a separate PAH-compound.

3.3 Results of the experiment investigating transgenerational
effects
3.3.1 Intergenerational comparisons
The variances in the ṀO2 of the exposed and control individuals within the F0 generation
were found unequal by Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances (F = 5.332, p = 0.008).
The ṀO2 within each group (control, 10%-V WSF and 30%-V WSF) was found normally
distributed using Shapiro-Wilks (p > 0.05). Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test
indicated no significant differences in the ṀO2 data between the different groups in the
parental generations (H = 0.672, p = 0.715).
Variances in the ṀO2 of the individuals from the first filial generation (F1 generation) were
found equal by Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances (F = 2.726, p = 0.072). The ṀO2
within the populations of individuals originating from parents exposed to 10%-V WSF or
30%-V WSF was found normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks p >0.05), but the ṀO2 of
individuals originating from the control-population was not normally distributed in ShapiroWilks, p = 0.000. Significant differences in the ṀO2were seen in the offspring originating
from differently treated parental populations (Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test H =
27.927, p = 0.000). The F1 offspring of the population that was exposed to 30%-V WSF had
48.1% (Pairwise comparison Kruskal-Wallis H = -25.3 p = 0.000) higher ṀO2 than the
offspring of the control individuals. The F1 offspring of the 30%-V WSF exposed population
had also 61.3% higher (Pairwise comparison Kruskal-Wallis H = -25.250 p = 0.000) ṀO2
than the F1 offspring of the 10%-V WSF exposed population. Any significant differences
were not indicated between the F1 offspring of the control population and the 10%-V WSFtreated population. The results are visualized in figure 2 in paragraph 3.3.2.
The variances within the second filial generation (F2) ṀO2 data were found equal by
Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances (F = 2.152, p = 0.125). The ṀO2 of the F2
offspring originating from the exposed populations (10%-V and 30%-V WSF) were normally
distributed (Shapiro-Wilk’s test p >0.05), but the individuals originating from the control
population did not show normally distributed values of ṀO2 (Shapiro-Wilk’s test W = 0.889,
p = 0.022). Significant differences, between the F2 offspring with different origins, were
pointed out by an Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test (H = 20.639, p = 0.000). The
lowest mean of the ṀO2 regarding the F2 generation was recorded for the offspring
originating from the 10%-V WSF exposed population, as seen in figure 2.
27

Individuals of the F2 generation that originated from the control population (Pairwise
comparison Kruskal-Wallis H =15.000 p = 0.024) had a significantly (29.3%) higher ṀO2
than the F2 offspring of daphnids exposed to 10%-V WSF. The F2 offspring of the
population exposed to 30%-V WSF (Pairwise comparison Kruskal-Wallis H = -25.571 p
=0.000) had a 57.3% higher ṀO2 than the F2 offspring of daphnids exposed to 10%-V WSF.
No significant difference was found between the F2 offspring of the control population and
the F2 offspring of the 30%-V WSF exposed population (Pairwise comparison KruskalWallis H = -10.571 p =0.185). Specific ṀO2 means and standard deviations for each
generation within the population are given in Appendix 4, Table 9.

3.3.2 Transgenerational comparisons
Examining the population exposed to a 30%-V WSF, the variances of the ṀO2 in the parental
generation (F0) were found equal with the two filial generations (F1 & F2) when tested with
Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances (F = 0.656, p = 0.523). The values within each
generation were found normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilks p >0.05). There were no
significant differences in the ṀO2 between the generations representing the population
generated from the parents exposed to a 30%-V WSF when the generations were compared
with an Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test (H = 3.537, p = 0.171).
The different generations presenting the population originating from the parents exposed to a
10%-V WSF did not show equal variances in the ṀO2 between generations (Levene’s Test
for Homogeneity F = 17.598, p = 0.000). The values within each generation were found
normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk’s p > 0.05). Significant differences between the different
generations in the population were indicated by an Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test
(H = 11.290, p = 0.004). Kruskal-Wallis pairwise comparisons indicated significant
differences between the F1 and F0 generation (H = 13.856 p = 0.039). The F0 had 44.1%
higher ṀO2 than the F1 generation. Significant differences between the F2 and F0 generation
were also indicated by the Kruskal-Wallis pairwise comparison (H = 17.865 p = 0.004). The
F0 had 53.2% higher ṀO2 than the F2 generation. No significant differences were indicated
between the F1 and F2 generation representing the population originating from the parents
exposed to a 10%-V WSF, as seen in figure 2.
The ṀO2 data from the control population was not found to have equal variances in ṀO2 of
different generations when tested with Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of variances (F =
8.027, p = 0.001). The values within the populations were found normally distributed in the
28

F0 generation (Shapiro-Wilk’s test p >0.05), but not in the F1 generation (W = 0.957 p=
0.489) or the F2 generation (W = 0.889 p = 0.022). Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis
Test indicated significant differences between the generations (H = 7.408, p = 0.025).
Pairwise comparisons gave a significant difference in the ṀO2 (H = 15.050 p = 0.022)
between the F0 generation and the F1 generation, F0 having 34.4% higher ṀO2. No
significant differences were found between F0 and F2 generation or F1 and F2 representing
the offspring of unexposed controls.

Figure 2 The mean and the SD of ṀO2 (Y-axis) for each generation (X-axis). The different populations are represented by
different colored lines. Star symbols (**) at the top of the figure indicate significant differences between the populations
within the generation in question. The color of the stars indicates between which populations the differences are found. Ex.
A blue star next to a black star at the point of generation F1 indicates that there is a significant difference in the ṀO 2 of the
individuals originating from the 10-% WSF-treated population and the individuals originating from the 30-% WSF-treated
population. Letters at the foot of the figure stand for differences between the generations within each population. The color
of each letter indicates which population it is presenting and a change of letter between generations means that there is a
significant difference in the ṀO2 between these generations. If a generation is presented by two letters, it is indicating that
the generation is similar to both generations presented by the letters. Ex. The ṀO2 of the F2 generation (a, b) in the Controlpopulation is statistically resembling both F1 (b) and F0 (a), but the ṀO2 of the F1 and F2 significantly differ from each
other, since represented by different letters. N=21 at each point of ṀO2 measurement.

3. 4 Reproduction success
Trends of reproduction success can be seen
from Figure 3, where the bars are
representing numbers of offspring at each
day throughout the 11-day observation
period. Without including statistical
evidence, it can be seen in the diagram
representing the P0 generation that the WSF
exposed organisms showed a three-day delay
in reproduction. The WSF exposed
individuals of both treatments in the
generation P0 gave birth to offspring first on
day 7 when the control group of the P0
generation reproduced on day 4 of the
observation period.
The clutch sizes were not even throughout
the 11-day observation periods but varied
from zero up to the highest recorded clutch
consisting of 322 individuals (generation F2,
the heavily exposed population). The largest
clutch sizes occurred especially in the latter
days of the observation period in all the
generations and populations. Only one
exception can be observed in this trend when
studying Figure 3: the F2 generation of the
population originating from the heavily
exposed population had the largest clutch
born already on day six. Also, the largest
clutches were born on day 7 for the control
Figure 3 The number of offspring (Y-axis) borne per day
(X-axis) for each population during an 11-day observation
period. The different generations P0, F1, and F2 are
included in different boxes and different populations are
represented by different colored staples.

population and the lightly exposed
population. Larger clutches were not
observed at later days during the observation
period in the F2 generation.
30

In the control population, the mean value for the number of offspring per day in the F0
generation was 48 (SD. 76.7) and the total number of offspring was 529. The individuals
exposed to a 10%-V WSF liquid had 196 offspring in total. The mean value for the number of
offspring per day was 18 (SD. 26.7). The individuals exposed to a 30%-V WSF liquid had a
total number of 298 born offspring. The mean of born offspring was 27 per day (SD. 53.71).
Considering the clutch sizes of different populations in the F0 generation the variance in
clutch size appeared equal (Levene’s test for homogeneity F = 0.91 p = 0.). The clutch sizes
were not found within normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk’s test of normality p <0.05 for each
population). A Kruskal-Wallis Test (H = 1.60, p = 0.22) indicated no significant differences
in the clutch sizes between the differently treated population in the F0.
The offspring of the 30%-V WSF exposed individuals and the control individuals in the F1
generation both gave births to offspring on day 6. The offspring of the 10%-V WSF exposed
individuals gave birth to their first clutch two days later. The mean value for the number of
offspring born per day in the population originating from the 10%-V WSF exposed founders
was 24 (SD. 36.6) and the total number of born offspring was 267. The mean value for the
number of offspring born per day in the population originating from the 30%-V WSF
exposed founders was 34 (SD. 37.1) and the total number of born offspring was 370. The
mean of born offspring per day was 28 (SD. 60.9) for the individuals originating from the
control population and the total number of born offspring was 295.
Variance in clutch size appeared equal in the F1 generation (Levene’s test for homogeneity of
variances F = 0.316 p = 0.731). Clutch sizes were not normally distributed in any group
(Shapiro-Wilk’s test of normality p <0.05). A Kruskal-Wallis Test (H = 0.73, p = 0.69)
indicated no differences in the clutch sizes between the different populations in the F1
generation.
The individuals in the F2 generation broke the earlier trends so that the individuals from the
exposed populations reproduced before the individuals in the control population. The
population originating from individuals exposed to a 30%-V WSF liquid started to reproduce
at day five, whereas the control population started to reproduce at day six, simultaneously
with the population originating from individuals exposed to the 10%-V WSF. The mean
value for the number of offspring born per day in the population originating from the 10%-V
WSF exposed founders was 36 (SD. 49.4) and the total number of born offspring was 395.
The mean value for the number of offspring born per day in the population originating from
31

the 30%-V WSF exposed founders was 71 (SD. 103.3) and the total number of born offspring
was 778. In the control population, the mean of born offspring per day was 44 (SD. 78.4) and
the total number of born offspring was 395.
Variance in clutch size appeared equal (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances F = 1.01
p = 0.38). Clutch sizes per day were not within normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk’s test of
normality p <0.05) and the Kruskal-Wallis Test (H = 1.66, p = 0.44) indicated no differences
in the clutch sizes between the different populations in the F2 generation.

4 Discussion

The current study provides an interesting viewpoint to transgenerational effects caused by
acute and heavy hydrocarbon exposure, an event that can follow marine oil spills (Rousi &
Kankaanpää 2012). The main result of this thesis was that the ṀO2 in the population
originating from the heavily exposed F0 generation (30%-V WSF) did not change throughout
generations in contrast to the two other populations:10%-V WSF and control. Generally, the
ṀO2 was lower in the F1 and F2 generations compared with the parental generation (F0) in
the two other populations that demonstrated differences between generations within each
population. The variances in ṀO2 were also equal in the F0, F1, and F2 generations of the
heavily exposed population. Contrastingly, the variances were not equal between the different
generations in the lightly exposed population or the generations in the control population
indicating that the heavy hydrocarbon exposure caused the reduction of variation in the ṀO2
throughout the generations that followed.
The stability of the ṀO2 throughout generations and the low variances of individual ṀO2
documented in the F0 generation of the heavily exposed population could indicate that a
heavy hydrocarbon exposure can cause the deterioration of the ability of an individual to
change its ṀO2 in a changing environment. This defect is possibly carried over generations
since the indication of a stable ṀO2 could be seen in the later generations of offspring. A
perspective like this is often forgotten in the risk assessments of oil spills (Elmgren 1983,
Rousi & Kankaanpää 2012, BRISK 2013, Nikinmaa & Anttila 2018) and makes the current
results very important. The possible explanation behind this phenomenon will be discussed
on a hypothetical level later in the discussion.
The trend of ṀO2 stability throughout generations in the heavily exposed population was not
reflected on the reproduction success, since the clutch sizes during the observation period
displayed equal variances in all the populations at every generation. Also, no significant
differences were documented in the clutch sizes between the different populations in any of
the generations, indicating that all the populations performed similarly in reproduction.

4.1 The chemical components in the WSF
As described in the introduction, the dissolving of molecular components from crude oil in
the water column depends greatly on environmental conditions as well as the amount and
type of oil released (Wernersson et al. 2004). Due to this, it is difficult to directly compare the
chemical composition of the water column following an actual spill with the created WSF
that was used in the current study. However, the PAH concentrations in the 30%-V WSF
exposure seemed to lie within the range of PAH concentrations that have been documented
following previous marine oil spills. The PAH concentration of the immediately conserved
30%-V WSF was found to be 27μg/l when again the concentration of corresponding
molecules named “Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds” (PAC) varied between 0.641
and12.833μg /l at different sites in parts of the Danish coast where 2400 tons of heavy bunker
oil was spilled (Pécseli et al. 2003). Oil spills of this scale have been estimated to occur in the
Baltic Sea in intervals of four years (Brusendorff et al. 2012). The PAH concentrations of the
immediately conserved WSF seem somewhat higher than the PAC values documented by
Pécseli et al. (2003), but the difference is not presumably very dramatic. Thus, it is known
that a significant fraction of the water-diluted hydrocarbons usually evaporates within a short
time following the release of oil into the water column (Albers 1995). The quick reduction of
PAH compounds is seen in the sample that was left to evaporate for 48 hours: only 1.9μg of
PAHs in one liter was present in the evaporated sample. If the analyzed sample of WSF had
not been conserved immediately, it would probably have reached exactly corresponding
values with Pécseli et al. (2003) following a couple of hours of evaporation.
The total hydrocarbon concentration in the created 30%-V WSF was high (3.6 mg/l), but only
PAHs in crude oil are generally considered as directly harmful components for living
organisms (Sikkema et al. 1995) and, thus, the effects of a crude oil hydrocarbon exposure
are associated specifically with the PAH concentration during the exposure. In the following
part, the major PAHs found in the WSF will be discussed due to their importance as
disruptive chemicals. Even small acute concentrations of PAHs have been noted to result in
biological uptake. For example, Corner et al. (1976) exposed adult copepod Calanus
helgolandicus for 24 hours to 10μg/l of naphthalene and observed a mean uptake of 3.6 pg of
naphthalene in the tissue of each exposed copepod. When considering the possibility of
biological uptake, it should also be noted that the algal P. subcapitata was also present in the
34

exposure tanks during the exposure period. It is most likely that the algae did perform
biological uptake of the harmful hydrocarbons during the highest peak of concentration and,_
thus,_ created an additional intake path of hydrocarbons to the D. magna in the tanks. Even
though most of the water-diluted PAHs had evaporated from the later WSF sample, D. magna
possibly took up PAHs in meaningful concentrations throughout the 48-hour period while
consuming the P. subcapitata. Regarding these factors, it is assumed that significant uptake
of PAHs, by exposing D. magna to WSF of crude oil, most likely was happening even though
the concentrations of PAHs were mild during the 48-hour exposure period of the parental
generation.
In the current exposure, the concentration of single PAHs was lower than what has been
reported in studies where the harmful effects of a hydrocarbon exposure have been
documented previously (Crider et al. 1982, Geiger & Buikema 1982, Schirmer et al. 1998).
However, the effects of a hydrocarbon exposure should most likely not be associated with
any single PAH present in the WSF, since the effects are more likely a matter of a synergistic
action of all the components in the WSF. This assumption is based on results where effects
following exposure to a single PAH have been documented to be milder than effects
following exposure to a mixture of hydrocarbons. For example, Moles & Rice (1983) noted
that 40-day chronic exposures to pure naphthalene (<0.87mg/l) caused significantly milder
reductions in the growth rate of juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbus) than the
corresponding concentrations of mixed hydrocarbons from crude oil WSF. Berdugo et al.
(1977) derived a WSF from aromatic heating oil and pure naphthalene. Naphthalene alone
did not cause any mortality at concentrations 1-2mg/l following a 24-hour exposure of the
copepod Eurytemora affinis, but 100% of the test organisms died within six hours following
an exposure to WSF of heating oil where the naphthalene concentration was between 252
and420μg/l.
In the created WSF, 92% of the identified PAHs were naphthalene. The concentration of
naphthalene was 25μg/l at the starting point of the experiment and decreasing to 1.7μg/l
during the 48-hour period. Phenanthrene, fluorene, and acenaphthylene were also found in
the sample conserved at the starting point, but all of them in lower concentrations than 1μg/l.
The PAHs in question are all light molecules containing two to three benzene molecules. The
presence of these compounds could be expected, since light PAHs are commonly found in

35

crude oil (NRC 2003). These light PAHs are also regarded as more water-soluble than the
heavier PAHs containing more benzene units (Albers 1995).
Naphthalene is formed by two combined benzene units without any substituents (Sikkema et
al. 1995). Studies using bacterial cells have shown that naphthalene can penetrate the cell
membrane passively and cause cellular malfunction following the uptake (Bateman et al.
1986). Naphthalene is well bioavailable in aquatic environments due to being relatively
water-soluble (Albers 1995). This also explains the high occurrence of naphthalene in the
created WSF. Significant effects of naphthalene on the ṀO2 have been seen in previous
research, but only when the exposure concentrations of naphthalene have been at least 40
times higher than in the current experiment. Darville & Wilhm (1983) noted a trend of
significant decrease in the ṀO2 of the Tanytarsus dissimilis and Chironomus attenuates when
the organisms were exposed stepwise to rising concentrations (1- 12mg/l) of naphthalene
during one hour per each exposure concentration. Lower concentrations than 1 mg/l (24 h) of
naphthalene were not found to cause any significant effects on the ṀO2 of D. magna (Crider
et al. 1982). The low concentrations of naphthalene could, thus, explain that no differences in
the ṀO2 of D. magna were discovered between differently treated individuals in the F0
generation.
Phenanthrene is built from three benzene units with no subunits (Hawkins et al. 2002).
Phenanthrene can accumulate in fish tissues and disrupt of the cell membrane that leads to
apoptosis (Sikkema et al. 1995). Abnormal mitochondrial functioning has also been identified
to be one of the mechanisms behind phenanthrene-caused cell death. A significant decrease in
mitochondrial membrane potential was accompanied by a significant amount of cell death
following a 48-hour exposure (53.5mg/l) to phenanthrene in adult Chinese rare minnows
(Gobiocypris rarus) (Hong et al. 2017). Mitochondrial dysfunction would probably lead to
lowered ṀO2, but to achieve this effect the concentration of phenanthrene would need to be
considerably higher than the concentration of phenanthrene in the currently created WSF.
Phenanthrene exposure has also been associated with decreased developmental rates and
reproduction rates in experiments where Daphnia pulex has been exposed to concentrations
of 0.11 mg/l and above of phenanthrene during lifelong exposure (Geiger & Buikema 1982).
Fluorene is a three-cyclic compound where two outermost cyclic structures are benzene rings
and the one in the middle is a cycloalkane (NCBI 2018a). Acenaphthylene is a molecule that
is built up by a naphthalene unit combined with a cycloalkane structure on one of the
36

horizontal sides of the naphthalene unit (NCBI 2018b). Exposure to both fluorene and
acenaphthylene has been shown to cause cell membrane perturbation when rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill-cells have been cultivated together with these contaminants for
only two hours at concentrations below 100μmol/l (Schirmer et al. 1998). These
concentrations correspond to approximately 16.6 mg/l for fluorene and 15.2 mg/l for
acenaphthylene and, thus, represent significantly higher concentrations of the substances than
what were present in the currently used WSF.
Part of the toxicity of PAHs is due to reactive metabolic products which cause cellular
damage. Metabolic processing of fluorene (Kopecka-Pilarczyk 2009), acenaphthylene
(Shimada et al. 2015), naphthalene (Brausch & Smith 2009) and phenanthrene (Yin et al.
2007) has been associated with up-regulated expressions of enzymes from the family
cytochrome P450. The P450 enzymes catalyze the detoxification processes of xenobiotics by
oxidizing the compounds. Oxidized PAHs can form reactive molecules that disrupt the
structure and function of essential proteins of the cell (O’Brien 1991) or give rise to reactive
oxygen species (ROS) that can disrupt biomolecules within the cell (Hawkins et al. 2002).
Shi et al. (2005) observed membrane disruption due to the lipid peroxidation of the cell
membrane fatty acids with a 150% increase in ROS prevalence in goldfish (Carassius
auratus) following a 24-hour exposure to naphthalene 0.5mg/l. ROS formation following a
phenanthrene exposure was also indicated in a study by Yin et al. (2007) by increasing the
rates of oxidative stress on the liver of the goldfish after a 4-day exposure to 50μg/l. Enzymes
belonging to the P450 family are recognized from nearly all domains of life, also daphnids
(Plopper et al. 2001, Brausch & Smith 2009). Thus, it is likely that harmful metabolites did
form in the metabolism of the model organism used in the current study and that levels of
oxidative stress would have been a suitable additional parameter to measure when
considering the effects of the WSF exposure in the F0 generation.

4.2 Effects seen in the F0 generation
The WSF exposures were not observed to directly shift the ṀO2 of the exposed individuals in
the pilot experiments nor the main experiment as expected. The lack of the significant
differences in the ṀO2s of the differently treated populations is probably due to this
parameter being affected by many other factors in addition to the exposure to oil (Clarke &
Fraser 2004) and a more perfectly defined environment would have been needed to study the
37

direct effects of a WSF exposure on the ṀO2. However, the variances of ṀO2 by the
differently treated populations in the F0 generation were unequal and the heavily exposed
population displayed the lowest standard deviation of ṀO2. This reduced variance is thought
to be a direct indicator of the effects of the heavy hydrocarbon exposure in the 30%-V WSF
exposed population.
Another directly seen consequence caused by the WSF exposure, in the pilot experiments and
the main experiment, is the increasing mortality following the increasing concentrations of
WSF. Also, a noted difference between the populations in the F0 generation was that both the
lightly and heavily exposed populations gave birth to their first brood three days later than the
control population. The delayed birth-giving indicated that the WSF exposure affected the
individuals by slowing down their sexual maturation. The delay of reproduction could be
expected based on previous experiments where Daphnia pulex had been exposed to
phenanthrene (Geiger & Buikema 1982). Exposure to PAHs has also been associated with
hormone-disrupting functions in a study where crayfish (Procambrus clarkia) had been
exposed to naphthalene (10 mg/l) for 48 hours and reduced ovarian development
demonstrated (Sarojini et al. 1994).
Also, when discussing the lack of the significant differences of the WSF exposure on the
ṀO2 of the exposed individuals at the parental generations it should be noted that only the
exposure-surviving individuals were included in the ṀO2 measurements and possible shifts of
ṀO2 could have been present in the individuals lost before the measurement.

4.3 Transgenerational effects in the F1 and F2
Based on the current results, it can be suggested that constancy of ṀO2 throughout
generations was generated by the heavy WSF exposure. This is demonstrated by the
insignificant differences of the ṀO2 between the generations within the heavily exposed
population and by the fact that the heavily exposed population was the only population in
which equality of variances was documented between generations using Levene’s test for
homogeneity of variances. Uniformity like this was not documented in the two other
populations where significant differences in ṀO2 were noted between different generations
within a population and equal variances were not present. Also, the F1 generation of the
heavily exposed population presented significantly higher ṀO2 than either the control or the
lightly exposed populations, simultaneously when differences between the F0 generation and
38

the F1 generation within the heavily exposed population were insignificant. Both additional
populations had significantly lower ṀO2 in the F1 generation compared with the F0
generation but, for some reason, the heavily exposed population did not follow the same
patterns of change throughout generations as the two additional populations.
No similar trends were seen in the reproduction success of the filial generations and no delays
in the day for the birth of the first clutches was documented for the offspring of exposed
populations indicating that reproductive disturbances demand direct exposure and are not
passed over to filial generations.
In light of these results, it can be suggested that exposure to high enough concentrations of
the crude oil WSF could affect the exposed organisms as well as their offspring by causing
metabolic stability in the population originating from heavily exposed individuals. Since the
light WSF exposure did not show a similar trend of stability in the parental generation nor
following generations, it is assumed that a threshold of WSF concentrations should be
exceeded before such transgenerational stability can be seen.
Even if the heavily exposed population presented significantly higher ṀO2 in the F1
generation compared with both additional populations, these significant differences were not
present in the ṀO2 between the heavily exposed population and the control population any
more in the F2 generation. The standard deviation of the heavily exposed population was also
higher than what the standard deviation was in the two additional populations in the F2
generation. These results, thus, indicate that the transgenerational effects seen as metabolic
stability disappeared after the first two generations had passed and that the transgenerational
effects caused by a heavy hydrocarbon exposure could be dissipating within a certain
recovery time. In future research, it would be interesting to study the effects of a similar
exposure on even later filial generations (F3, F4, and F5). A study including additional
generations, would show whether the reduced variation would be continuous in later filial
generations F3, F4, and F5.

39

4.4 Reasons for the seen transgenerational effects?
The current study was performed to examine whether transgenerational effects following a
crude oil hydrocarbon exposure could be found, but explanations for the documented
phenomena can unfortunately not be provided by the current results. Considering
contemporary biological thinking, the most likely explanation is that the heavily exposed
individuals decreased the variation of ṀO2 in response to the hydrocarbon exposure. This
assumption is based on the conception that genetically similar individuals, such as asexually
produced clones, can display different phenotypes after being exposed to different
environmental conditions (Pigliucci 2006). Even if the used model organism is a clone, it has
been proved that individual D. magna can have high phenotypic plasticity (Sakwińska 1998)
and, thus, differences in the ṀO2 could be assumed to occur naturally following
environmental change. Natural plasticity of the ṀO2 is also indicated by the unequal
variances of the ṀO2 and values not following normal distribution within the control and the
lightly exposed populations. The lightly exposed and the control population showed higher
standard deviation in the ṀO2 of the parental generation indicating that no factors reducing
ṀO2 variation were present in the treatments of the parental individuals.
Phenotypic alternations of offspring due to parental exposure have also been seen in previous
studies of clonal model organisms. Brausch & Smith (2009), for example, created
naphthalene resistant offspring in D. magna by exposing <24-hour-aged individuals for 48
hours, generation after generation, to higher and higher concentrations of naphthalene. The
LC50 of the first generation was 7.8μg/l, but during the study, the LC50 of the twelfth
generation became three times higher. Already the fourth generation displayed significantly
increased naphthalene tolerance due to the parental exposure to the PAH. The induced
resistance was explained by increased P450-enzymatic activity and supports the idea of
offspring changing their metabolic appearance following parental exposure to PAHs. The
current results can also be seen as evidence of phenotypic alternations due to parental PAH
exposure.
One explanation for the low standard deviation of the ṀO2 in the heavily exposed F0
generation could be that the heavy exposure-caused a type of metabolic shift of the exposed
individuals that reduced the variation of ṀO2. The inability of PAH-exposed organisms to
adjust the metabolism to changing oxygen contents and to cope with the demands of hypoxia
40

has been documented previously by Zou & Stueben (2006). In the study, the shrimp Penaeus
aztecus was exposed to naphthalene (500μg/l, 19–21°C) within a respirometer and the
response to stepwise lowering oxygen concentrations was recorded. To be able to maintain a
normal function of oxygen-dependent metabolism the naphthalene-exposed shrimps needed
1.33mg/l more oxygen to be present in the environment compared with the non-exposed
shrimps. Higher oxygen demand could explain the high ṀO2 in the F1 generation of the
heavily exposed population, but the ability to perform oxy-regulation following PAHexposure has not been studied from the offspring of the exposed organisms and the study of
Zou & Stueben (2006) gives no outlook to the transgenerational nature of the phenomena.
Some effects of exposure to PAH-compounds have been explained with epigenetic changes
induced by hydrocarbon exposure (Weis et al. 1998, Huang et al. 2016) and epigenetic
mechanisms have also been offered as a cause behind phenotypic plasticity (Metzger &
Schulte 2016). The documented phenomena of reduced variation throughout generations
among the heavily exposed population could, thus, be further investigated with epigenetic
markers to investigate whether the heavy hydrocarbon exposure changed variances of ṀO 2
via this mechanism.
Epigenetic changes are chemical changes on the surface of the genetic material,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that alter the way DNA is transcribed. Epigenetic changes can
also be passed over to the offspring affecting also the following generations (Bird 2007). One
of the best-known examples of epigenetic change is DNA methylation. Methylation is the
addition of methyl groups on the DNA molecule so that the transcription of genes is changed
(Metzger & Schulte 2016). Epigenetic changes can, thus, establish a significant difference
even between genetically similar individuals (Bestor 1998).
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon-exposure induced DNA methylation has been documented
by Huang et al. (2016) who observed significant reduction in micro-ribonucleic acid(miR)synthesis due to methylation of DNA encoding for a specific miR: the miR-133a. The effects
were observed when rat H9C2 cells were cultivated with 0.05μM of phenanthrene for 24
hours. The cells where methylation had occurred represented significant enlargement in size
and a twice more active protein synthesis compared with the non-exposed control cells. The
enlargement of the cultivated cells was coupled with the reduction of the miR-133a that is
normally inhibiting over-producing proteins. Interestingly, also the F1 generation of the
heavily exposed population displayed higher ṀO2 than the two additional populations. The
41

elevated ṀO2 could hypothetically indicate a higher phase of protein synthesis in the
offspring originating from the heavily exposed parents.
When discussing the possibility of epigenetic changes, the research of Trijau et al. (2018)
should be noted, since the study screened for transgenerational DNA methylations in three
generations following exposure of a parental population of D.magna for γ-radiation. Trijau et
al. (2018) found that methylations that occurred in germline cells, not somatic cells, could be
transmitted to the following generations. In the current research, the individuals representing
the F1 generation were exposed to hydrocarbons as primordial cells and, thus, the epigenetic
characteristics present in this generation should be passed over to the following F2
generation.

4.5 Consequences of the stable ṀO2
Lack of oxygen is associated with enforced effects of harmful PAH-exposures (Mu et al.
2017). Development in phenanthrene-enriched environment (100 μg/l) accompanied with
hypoxic conditions (2 mg/l O2) has shown to be significantly more harmful to the
development of larval zebrafish, than the same phenanthrene exposure in oxygen-rich (6.0
mg/l O2) concentrations (Cypher 2017). In research by Negreiros et al. (2011), cellular
damage of gill lamellar epithelium, indicated by hyperplasia and hypertrophy, was found
significantly more frequent in the slender seahorse (Hippocampus reidi) when exposed (8 h)
to hypoxia (1.5 mg/l O2) and crude oil (18 mg/l) simultaneously than if either of these factors
occurred separately. Analysis of the immediately conserved 30%-V WSF revealed much of
the same components which were present in the exposure by Negreiros et al. (2011)
(naphthalene 12 mg/l, phenanthrene 0.41 mg/l, and fluorene 0.87 mg/l). The heavily exposed
individuals in the F0 generation would, thus, supposedly have been very sensitive to reduced
oxygen levels in the environment during the time when the reproduction success was
monitored following the exposure. It would, thus, be interesting to study in the future whether
this kind of sensitivity is present in the offspring of heavily exposed organisms.
The loss of variation in the ṀO2 seen in the F0 and F1 of the heavily exposed population
could mean that the ability to adjust the metabolism to respond to changing environmental
conditions, like the temperature, was reduced due to the parental exposure. This type of
rigidness could be very harmful in natural environments where adapting to constantly
42

changing environmental conditions is necessary for the survival of daphnids (Carvalho 1987).
In general, adaptation to e.g. changing temperatures can be considered as necessary for all
living organisms especially in the Baltic Sea due to the presence of the four seasons. For
example, the mean temperature of surface water varied from 1 °C to 16 °C yearly during
1990-2017 in Bothnia Bay (HELCOM 2018). Offspring originating from the heavily
hydrocarbon-exposed parental organism could have difficulties tackling environmental
changes and, thus, the survival of these individuals could decrease drastically in the Baltic
Sea.
An acute decline in the population densities of planktonic species with short generation times
often follows an oil spill and the increase is usually seen when a couple of generations have
passed (Notini 1978, Linden 1979, Elmgren 1983). In light of the current results, it can be
concluded that recovery from oil exposure can last for several generations and, since
abnormal ṀO2 could be assumed to increase mortality in nature (Clarke & Fraser 2004), the
recovery time of a couple of generations could explain the observed short lag-phase of
decrease in planktonic population densities following oil spills. This would mean that also
transgenerational effects lie behind the population oscillations following oil spills and that the
effects documented are not merely caused by acute toxification of individuals that experience
the oil spill.

4.6 Reasons for variation in ṀO2 in the control and the lightly
exposed population
The laboratory conditions were only maintained between 18 and 22 ºC and the room
temperature was not fixed. This could have influenced the ṀO2 of the model organism used,
since small poikilotherm animals as D. magna have been observed to be especially sensitive
to the variation of the environmental temperature (Clarke & Fraser 2004). Thus, higher
temperatures are expected to stimulate increased metabolism and to cause higher ṀO2 (Khan
& Khan, 2008). The effect of small temperature variations is indicated by the significant
differences in the ṀO2 between the two identical 10%-V WSF exposures of the pilot
experiments. The only difference between the first and the second set 10%-V WSF exposure
was a 0.4 ⁰C temperature increase between the first (19.8 ºC) and second pilot (20.2ºC). This
elevation in temperature could be assumed to lie behind the significantly higher ṀO2 seen in
43

the 10%-V WSF exposure of the second pilot. It needs to be noted, however, that
measurements were made at the same temperature. Nevertheless, it seems that the cultivation
temperature had a significant influence on the ṀO2 in both the lightly exposed and the
control population, but not in the heavily exposed population.
Changing ṀO2 throughout the generations in the control and the lightly exposed daphnidpopulation could also be associated with the fluctuating temperatures of the laboratory during
the experimental period. The temperature of the stock aquarium had a slightly decreasing
trend during the experiment period. This decreasing trend in temperature could provide an
explanation for the lower ṀO2 observed in the F1 & F2 of the control and the lightly exposed
populations compared with the F0. Of course, new experiments where the temperature would
be stable between generations would need to be conducted to evaluate these assumptions.
An additional factor that might have caused differences in ṀO2 between the F0 generation
and the two filial generations seen in the lightly exposed and the control population is that the
parental generation was subjected to more relocation than the filial generations and,_ thus,_
the parental generations supposedly experienced more transfer-related stress than the filial
generations. The attempt was to equalize the treatments of each generation by creating a
sham exposure to the filial generations by letting them mature in a container to reach the
corresponding 96 hours of age when the ṀO2 of the parental organism was measured, but an
error was done in this sham exposure since the parental generation was let to mature in a
container until only 48 hours of age, where after they were transferred to the exposure tanks.
The filial generations were mistakenly not relocated at 48 hours of age but, instead, the filial
generations were let to mature in a single container until they reached the age of 96 hours.
This mistake might explain some of the differences seen between the different generations in
the lightly exposed and the control population since it was creating differences between the
treatments of generations and the amount of stress they were subjected to.

4.7 Evaporation of Water-Soluble Fraction of crude oil
High evaporation rates of PAHs from the WSF were indicated by the current results.

Especially low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons have been documented to evaporate quickly
44

from the WSF (Wakeham et al. 1983). These low-molecular-weight PAHs, which are also
found in the current WSF, are known to be highly volatile (Hong et al. 2017). When
considering the PAH reduction during the experiment, the trend of the total hydrocarbon (C5C40) levels seen in Table 4 is rather confusing. The concentration of the hydrocarbons was
increasing from 3.6 mg/l to 4.7 mg/l from the sample representing the starting point to the
end of the evaporation period. This pattern can, however, be explained by the fact that the
analysis was conducted from separate samples and, thus, the initial concentrations of
hydrocarbons may have been different.
The samples were collected into the bottles from the faucet at the bottom of the container and
so the sample to be collected last presented the surface layer of the WSF. One possibility is
that the surface layer contained dispersed oil droplets invisible to the eye that enriched the
last sample with petroleum hydrocarbons. The last sample collected was indeed the bottle that
was used to analyze the hydrocarbons following the 48-hour evaporation period. The genesis
of oil droplets has been documented when the behavior of oil slicks has been observed
following weathering processes, such as mixing oil with water by the waves (Wernersson
2004). The droplets possess the physical characteristics of oil and can flow in the most
surface layer of water (Almeda 2014) and, thus, it is natural that they ended up in the sample
filled up last.

45

5 Conclusions

The study aimed to investigate possible transgenerational effects following a crude oilderived hydrocarbon exposure. The results of the study showed such effects in the heavily
exposed population (30%-V WSF) where parental exposure was reflected in the filial
generations by reduced variation. Stable ṀO2 and equal variances between the generations
within the population could be recognized. In contrast, the ṀO2 varied and the variances were
unequal between the different generations of the two additional populations, the control and
the lightly exposed one.
The thesis in hand disputes the traditional methods to study crude oil hydrocarbon exposurecaused effects since these effects have mainly been investigated by tracking direct changes of
function such as vitality, reproduction capacity, and other physiological changes of the
exposed animals. The transgenerational effects of the current exposure were not however
observed as direct changes in function, but rather as reduced variation: standard deviation of
the ṀO2 was much lower in the heavily exposed population than it was in the two additional
populations, the control and the lightly exposed.
In the future, it would be engaging to research the molecular mechanism behind the observed
phenomenon and, also to investigate the impact of it on the affected individuals. A deeper
understanding of the results in hand would allow better utilization of them in risk assessments
considering oil spills in the Baltic Sea.

Appendix 1
Preparation of the cultivation medium M7
Daphnia magna was cultivated in a medium called “M7”. This medium was prepared
following the instructions in ´´OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals´´ (2014).
The preparations were made in two steps by first weighing and solving all the individual
components of “Stock 1” and “Stock 2” into separate stock solutions. The stock solutions
were stored at room temperature throughout the experiment period. The M7 was prepared by
combining desired volumes of the stock solutions from Stock 1 (Table 5) and Stock 2 (Table
6) together and lastly adding 1 mL batch of melted vitamin solution (Table 7). Whenever
components were dissolved into individual stock solutions or when a mixture of the stock
solution was done these solutions were always stirred with a magnetic stirrer to assure the
homogeneity of the solution. The pH of the ready M7 was set to 7.0-7.5 using 3M HCl
(Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK) and controlling the pH with Beckman Phi 32 pH meter
(Beckman Coulter Inc. Brea, California, U.S.). M7 was stored in a cold room for a maximum
of 1 week.
Table 5 The molecular components of Stock 1 are listed in the left-most column. Each component was weighed
and dissolved individually into a stock solution with a concentration given on the second rightest column of the
table. When a batch of M7 was prepared the individual solutions were combined in volumes presented in the
rightest column to create an outset-solution where components from Stock 2 were added.

Cultivation of the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata
The received stock culture of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (24th May 2017) was divided
into 6 x 1L Erlenmeyer flasks. A stock liquid for the P. subcapitata cultivation was prepared
following a protocol obtained from the Laboratory Centre for Ecotoxicology and Risk
Assessment of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) (Jyväskylä, Finland). A stock
liquid for the algae cultivation liquid was prepared by weighing and dissolving all the
individual components listed in Table 8. This stock liquid was then divided into 10 ml falcon
tubes and stored in a freeze at -20 °C. Actual cultivation liquid was prepared by melting and
mixing a single 10 mL batch of the stock liquid with 1990 mL of boiled and again cooled tap
water. This procedure gave a total of 2 l of cultivation liquid.
The growth flasks were re-filled with algae growth medium approximately twice a week to
keep a stable 800 mL liquid volume within each cultivation flask. Oxygen was supplied to the
flasks through MILLEX®-GP 0,22 µm sterile filters (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts,
U.S.) with air-pumps. A photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h dark was fixed for the algae using
the OSRAM Relax 15W 2700 K light bulbs.

Preparation of nutrition for Daphnia magna
Nutrition for daphnids was prepared from the living algae. For one dose of nutrition, 45 mL
of the algae culture was filtered through a FALCON® 40 µm sterile cell strainer (Corning
Incorporated, Corning, New York, U.S.) into 50 mL VWR® plastic High-Performance
centrifuge tubes (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, U.S.). The dosage in the tubes was
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4000 rpm with a Biofuge™ Stratos™-centrifuge (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham Massachusetts, U.S.).
The supernatant was discharged, and the remaining algae pellets were suspended with 15 mL
of fresh M7-media by shaking the centrifuge tube with a closed cap. The generated
suspension of M7 and P. subcapitata was added to the cultivation aquarium of daphnids to
maintain a constant light green in the cultivation medium.

Appendix 3
Preparation of one batch of a 100%-V WSF liquid
The procedure was performed adaptively following a description of WSF preparation by
Martinez-Jeronimo et al. (2005). A stock liquid of 100%-V WSF was created by weighing
100 g of crude oil (Russian Export Blend medium crude oil, Neste Oil, Raisio, Finland) into a
2.5L clean plastic bottle in a fume hood. Nine hundred mL of fresh M7 growthM7 growth
medium was then poured into the bottle and the bottle cap was closed. The mixture of oil and
M7 was stirred with a magnetic stirrer ~200 rpm for 24 hours. The mixture was then left to
separate from each other for one hour in a custom-made separation funnel. After the
separation, the M7 fraction was collected into a clean 1L glass bottle. The collected liquid
represented the 100%-V WSF.

WSF samples chemical analyses
Four samples of 30%-V WSF solution were prepared for chemical analysis. Four clean 1L
glass bottles were filled with 300 mL of the 100%-V WSF and 700 mL of fresh M7. The
bottle caps were sealed, and the liquids stirred by shaking the bottles by hand.
After the shaking two of the bottles were reopened and placed in a fume hood for a 48-hour
period. The evaporated samples were created to see how time affected the hydrocarbon
composition of the test-liquid. The liquids in the two remaining bottles were conserved
immediately by adding 2 mL of 6M HCl (Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, UK) to each and
then shaking the bottles with the cap sealed. The conserved bottles were stored in a cold room
under 5°C.
When the 48-hour period was reached, the bottles in the fume hood were conserved as
previous. The conserved samples where sent for further analysis to Novalab Oy, Karkkila,
Finland were the total hydrocarbon content (C5-C40) and concentrations of 16 different PAH
compounds (US-EPA PAHs) were determined.
The total hydrocarbon content was determined with a gas chromatography-flame ionization
detector (GC-FID) on heptane dissolved samples that had been cleaned, dried and
consecrated before the analysis. Based on the results, the hydrocarbons were divided into
middle heavy (>C10-C21) and heavy hydrocarbons (<C21-C40). External samples and blank
control samples were analyzed simultaneously with the test-liquid samples as a control. The
60

16 PAH-compounds were extracted with Toluene and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) with selected ion monitoring (SIM) technique. Also, these sample
extracts were cleaned, dried and consecrated before the analysis. The results were calculated
by using two inner standards for each compound. The detection limits of the method were
<0.05 mg /l for C10-C40 and 0.1 µg/l for PAH compounds.

Appendix 4
Temperature and ṀO2
The temperature in the laboratory was followed by measuring the temperature from the stock
aquarium of D. magna on a daily basis. The monitoring was done with a handled meter
pHenomenal® OX4100H (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, U.S.).
The measurements were performed to control that the temperature of the M7 was held
between 18 and22 °C. The measurements were not documented every day due to that all of
the measure values were found to lie within the fixed range. The documented values of
temperature during the experimental period are presented in figure 4. The vertical lines in
Figure 4 are also indicating the points for the ṀO2-measurements conducted. The numeric
values of the ṀO2-rates are given in table 9.

Figure 4 The temperature of the daphnid stock aquarium cultivation medium throughout the experimental
period. Y-axis represents the temperature in Celsius degrees and X-axis the time proceeding. The dots on the red
line are presenting temperature measure points and specific dates for the measurements given at each dot. The
vertical lines titled A, B, C, D and E are points of ṀO2-measurement days. A is the measurement day of the first
pilot experiment. B is the measurement day of the second pilot experiment. C is the measurement day of the F0
generation ṀO2 in the main experiment. D is the measurement day of the F1 generation ṀO2 in the main
experiment. E is the measurement day of the F2 generation ṀO2 in the main experiment.
