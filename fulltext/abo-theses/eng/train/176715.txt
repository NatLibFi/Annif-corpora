With the recent trend to shift from fossil feedstock to bio-based alternatives for fuels and
materials, a range of platform chemicals emerges. Utilization of these platform chemicals is of
great importance in the means of biorefining. For this, aldose oxidation has been of interest for
several years and the most common, glucose has been intensively studied. However, until now
only oxidation of individual sugars has been investigated. This work presents studies on the
catalytic oxidation of sugar mixtures of C6 glucose and C5 arabinose and focuses on
distinctions in the reaction. Catalysts of sizes ‚â§65 ¬µm with Au nanoparticle contents of 1 and
2 wt-% supported on Al2O3 and various types of carbon-based supports were investigated for
oxidation reaction purposes. Compared to other metals, Au exhibits the advantage of bypassing
over-oxidation, thus leading to deactivation. TEM revealed a distinct difference in PSD
between the supports and a parallel correlation to catalytic activity in oxidation reactions of
aldose mixtures. Oxidation reactions of arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures over 1% Au/Al2O3
catalysts were performed in a semi-batch reactor under varying conditions using molecular
oxygen as the oxidizing agent. The reactions were carried out under controlled pH conditions
and at atmospheric pressure. Alkaline pH conditions were applied to enhance reaction rates, yet

notable equilibrium shifts to lactones and fructose were observed at values above pH 8, limiting
the pH range. Similarly, temperatures above 70 ¬∞C exhibited lower rates and selectivity.
Increased partial pressure of oxygen enhanced the rate, though induced losses in selectivity to
aldonic acids. Furthermore, investigations on influence of varying arabinose ‚Äì glucose mass
ratios over 1% Au/Al2O3 catalyst and influence of catalyst loading were conducted. The catalyst
showed low activity during recycling and deactivation is concluded. Finally, a kinetic model
representing the catalytic oxidation reactions of arabinose and glucose, respectively, along with
the isomerization to fructose and ribulose was developed. The estimated values of the model
were concluded to fit well to the experimental data and the model‚Äôs validity was verified.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Biorefining
The principle of biorefining and green chemistry has gained immense popularity over the recent
decades. The trend to shift from fossil raw materials to sustainable options has developed into
a hot topic in both society and industry and research has strongly focused on this field. However,
as a substantial amount of backbone chemicals in our society, making up many of our everyday
utilities, is made from fossil-based feedstock, further development is still necessary. Thus,
refining of bio-based materials into fuels and materials along with valorization of valuable
chemical compounds have become main concepts of biorefining.
Today, biomass is utilized in multiple ways (Fig. 1.1). Besides chemical compounds
valorization through pyrolysis, gasification and different fractionation methods biomass is still
mostly burnt for energy production purposes. Fractionation of biomass compounds can be done
by several different methods and/or a combination of these. Pressurized hot-water extraction
(PHWE) is used for valorization of extractives [1], hydrolytic depolymerization and hydrolytic
hydrogenation for fractionation of saccharides [2].

Fig. 1.1. Biomass utilization pathways.

Lignocellulosic biomass, i.e. dry biomass, is split into three major building blocks: cellulose,
hemicelluloses and lignin. Lignin serves as the binder in the biomass and is principally present
1

Sebastian Franz
in the entire biomass. It glues the cells to the fibers together and the fibrils in the cell walls.
Lignin consists of heavily branched aromatics connected throughout the plant structure. This
results in only one single molecule of lignin in an entire tree, thus making the exact lignin
structure difficult to determine
Cellulose is the greatest constituent and is made up from non-branched polysaccharide chains
of Œ≤-D-glucose. These polymeric saccharides form the cell walls and tissue in biomass and give
it the strong structure. Hemicellulose is slightly more complex. It is composed of several
different monosaccharide units of pentoses (C6) and hexoses (C5) forming polysaccharides.
The backbone can consist of either one or multiple saccharides linked together attached with
uniform branching. An example of a hemicellulose are arabinogalactans. The backbone of
arabinogalactans consists of Œ≤-D-galactose and is branched with Œ≤-D-galactose, Œ±-L-arabinose
and glucuronic acid side chains [3].
Regarding chemical valorization, obtained aldoses (glucose, arabinose, galactose, etc.) can be
considered as platform chemicals for further valorization. Aldose hydrolysis results in an
alditol, reaction with an alcohol gives a hemiacetal and acids are formed by oxidation [4].
Gluconic acid, an aldonic acid derived from glucose oxidation, finds its use as a base for buffers
or additives in food and beverage products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals [5].
Extensive research on oxidation of monosaccharides into aldonic, uronic and aldaric acids has
been conducted and especially oxidation of glucose has extensively been studied [6-8]. Kusema
et al. demonstrated hydrolysis of arabinogalactan in acidic environment and subsequently the
individual oxidation of arabinose and galactose monosaccharides [9-11]. Further on, Herrera et
al. published a study on simultaneous hydrogenation of monosaccharide mixtures into their
respective alcohols [12]. However, so far, no studies on simultaneous oxidation of
monosaccharide mixtures into their acids have ever been reported, which confirms the
uniqueness of this work.

1.2 Catalysis by gold
To initiate oxidation reactions of aldoses, the presence of a catalyst is essential. Catalysts are
defined dependent on their nature and state as either heterogeneous, homogeneous or
enzymatic. Studies on the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid by oxygen have been conducted
2

Sebastian Franz
by both enzymatically and heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. For oxidation of arabinose to
arabinonic acid, reported methods have been conducted with heterogeneous catalysts [10, 13].
Additionally, the storing and handling requirements are less demanding for heterogeneous
catalysts, making them a more favorable choice for oxidation reactions of monosaccharide.
Noble metals such as silver, copper, platinum and palladium gained a lot of attention as
heterogeneous metal catalysts during the 20th century and are widely used in industry. The
awareness of gold (Au) as a catalyst has arisen in the recent decades, especially due to the
discovery of the high catalytic activity of small gold particles in low-temperature oxidation of
CO [14, 15]. Today, the use of gold as catalysts has besides oxidation reactions been widely
extended, including hydrogenation reactions, alkylation reactions and modification reactions of
olefins [16]. In oxidation reactions, advantages of gold over other metals is found not only in
the catalytic activity, but also in the catalyst stability. When the concentrations of dissolved
oxygen exceed the reacting amount of oxygen, oxygen starts to accumulate on the catalyst
surface, prohibiting reaction and promoting catalyst deactivation. The deactivation by overoxidation has been a substantial issue for metal catalysts [17-19]. On the contrary, Tokarev et
al., as well as Kusema et al., reported that gold does not encounter over-oxidation and is hence
a suitable catalyst for oxidation reactions with oxygen [20, 21]. Fig. 1.2 displays a simple
illustration of glucose oxidation with oxygen over a gold catalyst.

Fig. 1.2. Illustration of oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid by oxygen over supported gold particles.

Various carbon composites, silica and various metal oxides such as CeO2, TiO2, Fe2O3 and
Al2O3 have been reported as support materials for Au nanoparticles aimed for oxidation
reactions [11, 16, 22]. Carbon has been popular due to its stability in both acidic and alkaline
media and the convenient recovery of the catalyst by burning off the carbon [23]. However,
3

Sebastian Franz
gold catalysts supported on carbon for arabinose oxidation have been reported as less active
compared to catalysts supported on Al2O3, TiO2 and ZnO [10]. Although Delidovich et al.
presented results for glucose oxidation over Au/C comparable to Au/Al2O3 [22], the mean
particle sizes of gold nanoparticles supported on carbon are generally significantly larger [21,
24, 25].

1.3 Reaction mechanisms & isomerism
1.3.1 Glucose ‚Äì Mutarotation & isomerism
In aqueous solutions, D-glucose appears in five different forms (Fig. 1.3-a). Mutarotation
conforms the cyclic structure into two anomers, Œ± and Œ≤. These anomers of glucose differ in the
location of the hydroxyl group of the anomeric center located next to the ether bond.
Furthermore, isomerization of the ring gives cyclic hemiacetals of five-membered ring
structures (furanose) and six-membered ring structures (pyranose). Each of these four
structures,

Œ±-D-glucofuranose,

Œ≤-D-glucofuranose,

Œ±-D-glucopyranose

and

Œ≤-D-

glucopyranose, is in equilibrium with the acyclic D-glucose form. However, due to the higher
strain in the ring of the five-membered structure and thus lower stability, the amount of
glucofuranose has been reported to be below 0.2%, while the pyranose form reflects around
99.8% [26]. The acyclic form appears in a very low quantity (0.02%). Noteworthy is that an
increased pH favors the formation of the acyclic glucose [13]. The distribution between Œ±-Dglucopyranose and Œ≤-D-glucopyranose has been reported to be around 1:2, with 34.2-36% of
the Œ± anomer and 64 ‚Äì 65.8% of the Œ≤ anomer [27, 28]. However, the trend shows that the
amount of furanose increases slightly with temperature [29]. Additionally, in conditions of pH
8 and above, glucose undergoes basic catalyzed isomerization, shifting the carbonyl group from
the carbon-1 carbon to the carbon-2, forming fructose (Fig. 1.3-b) [30]. Open-chain aldoses
tend to react with the hydroxyl group, being dehydrated into a dehydrogenated aldehydrol form.
This intermediate reacts fast with hydrogen to form aldehydrol. For glucose, the ratio between
aldehydrol and aldehyde has been reported to be approximately 1:2. Yet, according to the trend,
the distribution between aldehydrol and aldehyde favors the hydrated form with a decreased
open-chain length [31].

1.3.2 Glucose ‚Äì Reaction mechanism
Following the suggestions for arabinose oxidation presented by Correia et al. [13], two reaction
pathways for glucose oxidation are present (Fig. 1.4). In one route, the acyclic glucose is
converted into its aldehydrol form after which the molecule is adsorbed onto the catalyst active
site. Oxidation results in gluconic acid giving hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. In alkaline
conditions, gluconic acid appears as gluconate, as the carboxyl group is deprotonated by the
base.
The other route proceeds through the furanose ring form, which adsorbs directly onto the
catalyst site. It reacts further to a dehydrated form of glucono-1,4-lactone (glucono-Œ≥-lactone),
followed by rapid deprotonation to an ester, isomerization into the more stable six-membered
ring of glucono-1,5-lactone (glucono-Œ¥-lactone) and desorption from the catalyst site. Alkaline
hydrolysis of the ester group with water opens the lactone ring and results in gluconic acid,
which is present as gluconate in alkaline media.

1.3.3 Arabinose ‚Äì Mutarotation and isomerism
Similar to glucose, five different conformations of arabinose are present in aqueous solutions;
two pyranoses (Œ±, Œ≤), two furanoses (Œ±, Œ≤) and one acyclic (Fig. 1.5). Since the pyranose form
is more stable than the furanose form or the acyclic form, the arabinopyranose form appears as
the major component with around 95% (60% Œ±-pyranose, 35% Œ≤-pyranose) at 31 ¬∞C [29]. The
arabinofuranose form represents approximately 4% (3% Œ±-furanose, 1% Œ≤-furanose) and the
acyclic arabinose the remaining ‚â§1%. These numbers are notable higher than for glucose at
similar conditions.
In most literature, isomerization of arabinose to ribulose is reportedly catalyzed by enzymes
[32, 33]. Murzin et al., however, reported aldose ‚Äì ketose interconversion of arabinose to
ribulose over a heterogeneous catalyst at basic pH [34]. Accordingly, the catalytic isomerization
of arabinose to ribulose over Au nanoparticles is suggested in this work.

1.3.4 Arabinose ‚Äì Reaction mechanism
Correia et al. developed a kinetic model for the mechanism of arabinose oxidation where both
cyclic and acyclic arabinose are oxidized, following two pathways [13]. Low quantities of both
cyclic arabinofuranose and acyclic arabinose indicate their lower stability, allowing to consider
both as reactive components. Fig. 1.6 illustrates the reaction pathways for arabinose oxidation.
One reaction route starts from arabinofuranose which is directly adsorbed and oxidized into its
arabino-1,4-lactone (arabino-Œ≥-lactone) form and further isomerized into a more stable arabino1,5-lactone (arabino-Œ¥-lactone). In alkaline aqueous conditions lactone is hydrolyzed and the
ring structure is opened. The resulting arabinonic acid is deprotonated in the alkaline media to
arabinonate. The other route starts with the acyclic arabinose form, which in alkaline aqueous
conditions is transformed into its corresponding aldehydrol form. In this case, the aldehydrol is
adsorbed onto the catalyst site and oxidized into arabinonic acid. Again, the acid occurs as
arabinonate due to the alkaline conditions.

1.4 Scope
The objective of this work was to perform catalytic oxidation reactions of sugar mixtures over
gold catalysts at constant pH. The reaction was performed in a batch mode reactor and oxygen
was used as the oxidizing agent. As catalysts gold nanoparticles supported on different alumina
and carbon were used. To investigate and understand the reaction fundamentals, focus was set
on the following tasks:
-

Screening Au catalysts supported on both Al2O3 and different carbon structures in
oxidation of sugar mixtures.

-

Investigation of a correlation between catalyst particle size and catalytic activity.

-

Exploring the influence of such parameters as temperature, pH, oxygen pressure,
catalyst mass and sugar ratios.

-

Comparison of the individual influence of the parameters on oxidation of C5 arabinose
vs C6 glucose.

-

Development of a kinetic model based on a feasible reaction mechanism.

2 EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Catalyst preparation
The support is known to have an influence on the physiochemical and catalytic properties. With
the purpose of investigating different supports, catalysts with Au nanoparticles deposited on
different types of alumina and carbon were used. Two methods for the preparation of
heterogeneous catalyst were selected: direct ion-exchange (DIE) and deposition-precipitation
with urea (DPU). In DIE, the metal ions are deposited onto the catalyst surface through
electrostatic interactions, while in DPU the reposition relies on supersaturation [35]. The
catalysts used in this work were all prepared by different collaborators. In this work, ten
different catalysts in the oxidation of glucose and arabinose were studied, as presented in Table
2.1.

2.1.1 Gold nanoparticles on alumina support (Au/Al2O3)
Al2O3-supported Au catalysts a) and b) (Table 2.1) were prepared by Irina Simakova (Boreskov
Institute of Catalysis, Russia) according to the deposition-precipitation method (DPU)
presented in [10]. To 1.6 mM aqueous solution of HAuCl4 with urea (0.21 M) heated up to 81
¬∞C, alumina support in powdered form was added. The amount of HAuCl4 solution was
calculated to result in the final gold loading of 1% in the catalyst. The suspension of HAuCl4,
9

Sebastian Franz
urea and Al2O3 was mixed under heating at 81 ¬∞C for 4 hours and then filtered. Afterwards, the
catalysts were washed with water and then additionally with a NH4OH solution for the removal
of excess chloride after deposition of gold onto the support [10, 36]. After further washing with
deionized water and filtering, the catalysts were dried at room temperature. Catalyst a) was
dried for ca. 6 h and was wet upon the pretreatment, while catalyst b) was dried for 24 and was
well dried. Finally, pre-treatment of the catalysts was done in an airflow with an increasing
temperature ramp of 2 ¬∞C/min until 350 ¬∞C.
Catalyst c) (Table 2.1) was prepared by Olga Simakova (√Öbo Akademi University) using
presumably direct ion exchange analogous to other Al2O3-supported catalysts with this Au
content [37].

2.1.2 Gold nanoparticles on carbon-based support (Au/C-x)
Carbon-based catalysts (d ‚Äì i) (Table 2.1) were prepared by Nataliya Scherban (L.V.
Pisarzhevskiy Institute of Physical Chemistry, Ukraine). The microporous carbon support i)
was prepared by pyrolysis of sucrose. Mesoporous supports d) through f) were carbon-silica
composites based on a mesoporous cellular foam (MCF). The composite was obtained by
mixing MCF with sucrose and H2SO4 in an aqueous solution. Melamine in ethanol was used to
functionalize C-N-MCF and C-N-MCF-Ox supports. Removal of silica present as a result from
the carbon-silica composites was done by treatment in an aqueous HF solution, washing and
drying. Preparation of CxNy-MCF was done by pyrolysis of ethylenediamine and CCl4. C3N4
was prepared by the method presented in [38].
The loading of Au onto the catalysts, corresponding to 2 wt-%, was performed according to
the procedure described in [39, 40]. After pre-calcination at 150 ¬∞C for 2 h, the support (1 g)
was mixed with a solution of 25 ml 4.2 mM HAuCl4 and 0.42 M urea and heated under stirring
(90 ¬∞C, 250 rpm) for 24 h. After cooling, washing and drying, the catalysts were calcined in air
at 250 ¬∞C for 2 h.

2.2 Catalyst characterization methods
2.2.1 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The particle size was determined using transmission electron microscopy (JEOL JEM1400Plus). The samples were prepared by suspending the catalyst particles in ethanol and
pipetted onto the microscope grid. As highly volatile ethanol evaporated, pure catalyst particles
were observed in the imaging. The Au particle size distribution was determined by measuring
the particle diameter for over 300 particles for each sample using ImageJ software [41].

2.3 Experimental setup
2.3.1 Reactor setup
All reactions were performed in a 250 ml glass semi-batch slurry reactor (Fig. 2.1). The reactor
was equipped with a gas entrainment impeller and a heat jacket using water. The solid catalyst
and the liquid were in batch mode, while
the gas was continuously fed into the
slurry. A Brooks 5850S device was used to
control and adjust the gas feed. Excess gas
was vented via a heat exchanger to the
atmosphere. In this way escape of any
vapors, changing the reaction mixture
composition,

was

prevented.

Upon

entering the reaction mixture, the gas was
led through a metal frit to minimize the gas
bubble size and, together with efficient
agitation, diminishing the limitations by
the diffusion of oxygen into the solution.
Temperature and pH were controlled with
a Metrohm Titrando 907 device equipped
with a Metrohm Unitrode electrode.

2.3.2 Oxidation of sugars
The reactor was flushed with around 65 ml/min argon and heated to the desired reaction
temperature. During flushing, the dry catalyst with particle size < 65 ¬µm was inserted into the
reactor. Catalyst particles that remained on the upper reactor walls were washed down to the
bottom with 0.5 ml water. Simultaneously, the sugar solution of L-Arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich,
‚â•99%) and/or anhydrous D-Glucose (Fluka, ‚â•98%) were heated to approximately 40-50 ¬∞C
under stirring to minimize the temperature difference. The solution contained in all cases a total
amount of 2 g/100ml sugar dissolved in deionized water with a total volume of 150 ml. This
specific sugar concentration was chosen as it lies in the same region as the products in the
hydrolysis of hemicellulose into monosaccharides, as reported by Kusema et al. [9]. Once the
reactor was fully flushed, the sugar solution was poured into the reactor and heated in argon
atmosphere to the reaction temperature under stirring and pH control. A high agitation rate of
1000 rpm was used to diminish the influence of external mass transfer limitations. Upon
reaching the reaction temperature, the argon flow was reduced to the value used in the reaction
and the pre-adjusted oxygen was introduced into the argon flow, resulting in a total gas flow of
40 ml/min. The pH was controlled by addition of 1 M NaOH.
Before taking a sample, a pre-sample of 0.3 ml was withdrawn with a syringe and discarded,
after which a fresh sample of 0.7 ml was withdrawn from the reactor. The samples were filtered
through a 0.45 Œºm PVDF filter to avoid catalyst particles from entering the analysis devices
and to inhibit further reactions.

2.3.3 Washing of catalysts
For recycling, the catalysts were taken out of the reactor together with the reaction mixture and
let to sediment, after which most part of the liquid phase was discarded. The remaining slurry
was centrifuged, the liquid removed, the catalyst washed with deionized water and again
centrifuged. This process was repeated 3-4 times before the remaining water was dried off.
Drying of the catalyst took place in an oven at 58 ¬∞C before being stored in a desiccator until
reuse.

2.4 Analysis methods
2.4.1 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Analysis of the reactants and products was performed by high performance liquid
chromatography (VWR Hitachi Chromaster) equipped with a 300x7.8 mm Bio-Rad Aminex
HPX-87C column and a RI detector (VWR Hitachi Chromaster 5450). The operating
temperature of the column was set to 80 ¬∞C and the flow rate 0.6 ml/min using 1.2 mM CaSO4
as the eluent, resulting in a column backpressure ranging between 65 and 70 bar. The injection
volume of the sample was set to 10 Œºl.
Identification of the products was done by comparing the retention time with the standards as
well as by applying the splicing method (Table 2.2). Quantification was performed by
calibrating a series of samples of known concentrations. The slope from the linear plot of the
concentration as a function of the peak area, was used to determine the concentrations.
It should be mentioned that the peaks of glucono-Œ¥-lactone and gluconic acid overlap. Hence,
the glucono-Œ¥-lactone was neglected and instead counted into the gluconic acid. The remaining
data concerning calibration are available in Appendix I.

2.4.2 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
Potential leaching of metal particles into the liquid phase during the reaction was investigated
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer, Elan 6100 DRC Plus). The
liquid samples, placed in a PTFE vessel, were dissolved in aqua regia solution in a microwave
oven (Anton Paar, Multiwave 3000). Subsequently, the samples were diluted with water, first
to 100 ml and then further to volumetric ratio 1:5. The acids used for the aqua regia solution
were of Suprapur¬Æ grade (30% HCl, Merck; 65% HNO3, Merck). For calibration, a
commercial multielement standard was used.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Catalyst characterization
Catalyst characterization was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for
determination of the particle size distribution (PSD) of gold on the catalyst support. Reportedly,
catalytic oxidation of sugars is structure sensitive with a maximum catalyst activity at cluster
size 2.3 nm, exponentially decreasing at higher and lower sizes [37]. Large particle sizes (dp )
for the carbon-based catalysts were hypothesized and thus only two carbon-based catalysts (see
Section 3.2.1) were investigated along with all three Al2O3-supported catalysts (Fig. 3.1-Fig.
3.5).
The PSD was determined by manually measuring dp for over 300 Au particles from at least six
different positions, which also was used for calculating the mean particle size (dp ) from
equation (1). However, particles of sizes larger than 10 nm were not considered, as they were
presumably not affecting the oxidation reaction. Therefore, also the calculation of the turnover
frequency was pretermitted.

Au catalysts supported on Al2O3 demonstrated a PSD certainly closer to the reported optimum
than carbon-supported catalysts. The largest difference between Al2O3-supported catalysts was
the percentage of particles of size below ‚â§10 nm. For catalyst 1% Au/Al2O3-B particles sizes
of up to 77 nm were observed while for the other Al2O3-supported catalysts all particles were
‚â§35 nm. Due to the large interval, catalyst 1% Au/Al2O3-B had only 75% of the counted
particles within the interval of below 10 nm, while 1% Au/Al2O3-A and 1% Au/Al2O3-C had
85% and 99%, respectively. On the other hand, application of a modified Gauss fit,
implemented in the Origin software, for particles ‚â§10 nm showed that catalyst 1% Au/Al2O3-B
peaked at around ùëëùëù,ùê∫ùëéùë¢ùë†ùë† = 2.2 nm. This implies that most of the counted particles are around
this size. Compared to the other catalysts, this is the closest to the reported optimal particle size.
17

Sebastian Franz
For catalyst 2% Au/C-MCF only 15% of the counted particles were within the 10 nm interval.
For these particles, dp was calculated to 3.85 nm. Simultaneously, particles with sizes up to 138
nm were measured, resulting in an exceedingly broad overall PSD. In comparison, catalyst 1%
Au/C had 93% of the particles within this area. dp , however, was significantly larger with 4.65
nm for particles ‚â§ 10 nm. The modified Gaussian distribution fit peaked at 1.95 and 4.25 nm
for catalysts 2% Au/C-MCF and 1% Au/C, respectively. For catalyst 2% Au/C-MCF, however,
should be considered with care due to a low amount of particles ‚â§ 10 nm. Graphs for the full
PSD range are available in Appendix II.
Catalyst 1% Au/Al2O3-B was also analyzed after an oxidation reaction of 1:1 arabinose ‚Äì
glucose mixture at 70 ¬∞C, pH 8 and 0.125 atm pO2. Prior to imaging, the catalyst was washed
according to the method described in Section 2.3.3. Larger particles were not to be found in the
same quantity as for the fresh catalyst. Comparison of measured PSD (Fig. 3.6) between the
fresh and the used catalyst confirmed these observations. Based on these observations an ICP-

For Al2O3-supported catalysts, fiber-like structures were observed (Fig. 3.7-i ‚Äì iii). These
structures consist of pseudoboehmite, AlOOH, a precursor for Œ≥-Al2O3 formation by calcination
[42]. However, a correlation between the particle size and pseudoboehmite structures was not
observed. Silica particles remaining from the catalyst preparation were observed for Au/C-MCF
(Fig. 3.7-iv).

3.2 Oxidation of sugars
During oxidation of sugars, a special focus was put on six parameters which were suspected to
influence the reaction. Catalyst support, temperature, pH, mass of catalyst, sugar concentrations
and partial pressure of oxygen were the key issues studied. The reaction with 1% Au/Al2O3-B
and conditions of 1:1 arabinose ‚Äì glucose mass ratio, 70 ¬∞C, pH 8, pO2 = 0.125 atm and mcat =
0.1 g was used as a reference reaction. The use of mass ratios is justified by the compatibility
to the industrial use of units. In this work, the converted values of mass ratios to molar ratios
are presented in Table 3.3. The stirring speed of 1000 rpm was constant for all experiments.
The pH control setup ensured minimal pH fluctuations of ¬±0.1 from the set point. It has been
verified that under similar conditions, the external mass transfer limitations can be neglected
[21]. Due to the small catalyst particle size, internal mass transfer limitations were also
neglected.

19

Sebastian Franz
Noteworthy are issues with the reaction setup which appear upon reaction start. When the
solution is poured into the reaction and flushed with argon, the liquid contains oxygen but is
not saturated. Consequently, the initial reaction rate was thus influenced by oxygen saturation.

3.2.1 Catalyst support screening
In total ten gold catalysts supported on
either carbon, carbon composites or
alumina were investigated (Table 3.2).
Oxidation reactions were carried out at
70 ¬∞C, pH 8 and pO2 = 0.125 atm with
1:1 arabinose ‚Äì glucose mass ratio.

between the catalysts (Fig. 3.8 & Fig. 3.9). Catalysts with carbon-based supports showed low
to negligible catalytic activity compared to Al2O3-supported catalysts. From Table 3.2, catalysts
f), h), i) and j) showed minor or no catalytic activity. For catalyst h) a significant formation of
fructose could be suggested, as the amount of arabinose appeared to increase while the amount
of glucose decreased and no aldonic acids were formed. Since the peaks of arabinose and
fructose overlap, glucose isomerization to fructose was hypothesized. The appearance of
fructose is also determined for catalyst e), where fructose formation contributes to convergence
of the mass balance closure. The carbon-supported catalysts that exhibit significant acid
formation, i.e. catalysts d), e) and g) show besides arabinonic acid an equal selectivity to both
gluconic and glucuronic acid. For Al2O3-supported catalysts, glucuronic acid was either not
observed or present in negligible amounts.

Catalyst B showed the highest selectivity to gluconic acid with 100% selectivity at 98%
conversion, compared to 91% and 89% for catalysts A and C, respectively. The major byproduct in the reactions with catalysts A and C is presumably fructose. However, the influence
of fructose decreases at higher conversion and has thus less impact towards full conversion
(Section 3.2.2). The selectivity to arabinonic acid was around 100% for all three catalysts.

3.2.2 Influence of catalyst loading
To study the influence of other parameters, it is desired to operate at a catalyst loading where
no limitations due to the gas ‚Äì liquid mass transfer occur. Oxidation reactions of 1:1 arabinose
‚Äì glucose mass ratio with different catalyst loadings of 1% Au/Al2O3-B were performed under
the same conditions of 70 ¬∞C, pH 8, and pO2 = 0.125 atm. Plotting the rate against the catalyst
loading reveals that the productivity at sugar-to-gold molar ratios above 24000:1 does not
significantly change with an increased catalyst loading (Fig. 3.11-left). Consequently, the rate
dependent on the mass of catalyst obtains a maximum at 0.1 g catalyst loading. Furthermore, at
low catalyst loading the reaction order increases, indicating mass transfer limitations [22].
Accordingly, subsequent experiments were performed at the catalyst loading of 0.1 g.

3.2.3 Influence of sugar concentrations
In mixtures of arabinose and glucose, the two sugars compete for the adsorption onto the
catalyst surface. Thus, different ratios between the sugars may influence adsorption. The
concentrations of individual were adjusted by varying the ratios between arabinose and glucose
while keeping the total sugar content of 20 g/l. Mixtures with mass fractions of 1, 0.75, 0.5 and
0.25 of both arabinose and glucose, respectively, were investigated (Fig. 3.12). The parameters
ùëò and ùëõ were evaluated with equation (3) using Origin Software.
As the fraction for glucose decreases, a negative reaction order was observed. For high mass
fractions oxidation of arabinose is preferred. With a decreasing amount of arabinose, the rate
of glucose oxidation is increasing.

Fig. 3.12. Oxidation of arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures with alternating mass ratios over 1% Au/Al2O3-B at 70 ¬∞C, pH 8,
pO2 = 0.125 atm and mcat = 0.1 g. The graphs of the individual sugars are kept separate for illustrative purposes.

For mass fractions lower than 1, the rate of arabinose oxidation changes linearly with the mass
fraction. However, for solutions with arabinose mass fractions equal to 1, the rate of arabinose
is similar to the rate at mass fraction 0.75. Oxidation of glucose reveals the same behavior as
for arabinose. For mixtures, the rates for glucose oxidation are approximately half of the rates
for arabinose. The highest overall rate was obtained for arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixture with the
mass ratio 3:1, which can be related back to the rates for formations of furanose and open-chain
form. For solutions with arabinose mass ratios of 0.75 and higher, the rate for the formation of
these components is limiting the oxidation reaction of arabinose. With addition of glucose, the
glucofuranose and its acyclic form will also be available on the catalyst surface, increasing the
catalytic activity.

On the contrary, higher glucose fraction decreases the selectivity to gluconic acid, presumably
due to an enhanced formation of fructose. Along with the selectivity, the calculated and

and the summarized overall reaction. The rates are calculated accoding with c0 = 0.06 mol/l for both arainose and glucose.

For the experiments with only one sugar, no overlapping peaks appear during analysis. Thus, it
is possible to observe all products separately and determine a more accurate selectivity towards
the aldonic acids. As seen in Fig. 3.14, the selectivity towards the respective aldonic acids is
very high. For arabinose, the corresponding lactone appears to some extent, yet rapidly
decreasing with time. Furthermore, small quantities of ribulose formation are observed
throughout the reaction, decreases, however, towards full conversion of arabinose. For glucose,
the most considerable by-product is fructose, which like arabino-Œ¥-lactone only has a greater
significance in the beginning, decreasing with conversion.
An unidentified product was observed for both arabinose and glucose oxidation. It is
hypothesized that this product reflects a formation of oligomers, as it during analysis appears
at similar retention times as confirmed oligomers (6.2 min). Graphs from HPLC analysis for
both reactions are presented Appendix IV.

3.2.4 Influence of temperature
Oxidation of arabinose over gold nanoparticles had earlier been conducted at 60 ¬∞C [13]. In this
work, for comparison, the reaction temperature interval from 50-80 ¬∞C was studied. Besides the
increase in catalytic activity with temperature according to Arrhenius‚Äô equation, as discussed
in Section 1.3, the mutarotation equilibrium is slightly shifted with temperature towards a
higher furanose fraction, hence giving a higher amount of reactive compounds. On the contrary,
the gas ‚Äì liquid solubility follows the equation for temperature and pressure dependent gas
solubility in water (6) [44], thus suffering with increased temperature. The temperature T is in
Kelvin (K).

Reactions with varying temperature were performed at pH 8, pO2 = 0.125 atm and the catalyst

illustrative purposes, the reactions for arabinose and glucose are split into separate graphs (Fig.

As expected, the trend shows an increasing rate with temperature, although identical results at
60 and 70 ¬∞C for arabinose oxidation were observed (Table 3.4). However, at 80 ¬∞C a decrease
in the overall rate was observed, thus giving the maximum rate at 70 ¬∞C for glucose and at 6070 ¬∞C for arabinose. The same behavior and maximum were observed for catalyst 1%
Au/Al2O3-A. Overall, temperature had a larger impact on glucose than on arabinose oxidation.
Furthermore, lower selectivity towards gluconic acid was obtained especially at temperatures
above 70 ¬∞C. The selectivity to gluconic acid was noticeably lower at 80 ¬∞C than at temperatures
below 70 ¬∞C. Thus, the apparent activation energy (Ea) is calculated from the linearized form
of the Arrhenius equation (7) without considering the data at 80 ¬∞C.

3.2.5 Influence of pH
Oxidation of aldoses gives aldonic and uronic acids and thus a decrease in pH, causing not only
a decreased rate, but also potentially catalyst deactivation. Low pH enhances adsorption of the
acids on the catalyst, hindering adsorption of reactants and suppressing the reaction [21]. With
increased pH, the ring-opening process of the lactones is favored and thus a higher yield of
aldonic acids is obtained. For glucose, it has been reported that from neutral pH values,
conversion of lactone into glucuronic acid increases rapidly [47]. However, high pH values
promote the formation of by-products. For example, an increase in pH enhances the

Three experiments at pH values 7, 8 and 9 were conducted under the same conditions of 1:1
arabinose ‚Äì glucose mass ratio, 70 ¬∞C, pO2 = 0.125 atm and mcat = 0.1 g (Fig. 3.17). It was
considered that the isomerization to fructose would play a significant role at pH values from 10
and above, hence no experiments at higher pH were performed. In other studies, reporting
arabinose oxidation under similar conditions, pH in this range had a significant impact on the
reaction [21]. However, in the current work no major influence of pH on the reaction was
noticed. For arabinose, pH 8 and 9 displayed close to identical results, while the reaction
proceeded slightly less slowly at pH 7 (Fig. 3.18). Glucose showed equivalent results, where
the rates at pH 8 and 9 were akin and slightly lower at pH 7. The highest selectivity towards
gluconic acid was obtained at pH 8. At 9 the selectivity to gluconic acid suffered presumably
31

Sebastian Franz
due to a higher isomerization rate to fructose. Specific values are given in Table 3.5. At pH 7,
the lower selectivity to aldonic acids could be explained by a decreased rate of the lactone ringopening.

3.2.6 Influence of oxygen pressure
It has earlier been mentioned that gold does not undergo over-oxidation and thus, an excess in
oxygen will not induce catalyst deactivation. However, due to the adsorption of oxygen onto
the active sites, an excessive concentration of oxygen may lead to lower availability of active
sites to sugar molecules, diminishing the oxidation rate.
Since oxygen also is a reactive component, the rate equation for the nth order is modified to
also include the oxygen concentration as a parameter. Earlier, as the oxygen concentration was
constant it was included into the rate constant k in equation (3). Now, ùëò is further fractionated
according to equation (8), where ùëò‚Äô reflects the rate constant independent on the oxygen
concentration, ùëêùëÇ2 the oxygen concentration and ùëõùëÇ2 the reaction order for oxygen.

Fig. 3.19. Oxidation of 1:1 arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures over 1% Au/Al2O3-B at different oxygen pressures and conditions of
70 ¬∞C, pH 8 and mcat = 0.1 g. For illustrative purposes, the sugars are displayed in separate graphs.
The lines represent the rate calculated with equation (3).

While oxygen concentration increases linearly, the oxidation rates of arabinose and glucose
does not follow the same trend (Table 3.6). At oxygen pressures below 0.125 atm, a clear
insufficiency of oxygen is observed, indicating the presence of gas ‚Äì liquid mass transfer
limitations and thus decelerating the reaction. On the contrary, at oxygen pressures over 0.125
atm the rate slightly started decreasing, resulting in a rate maximum at 0.125 atm. At oxygen
pressures above 0.125 atm, the high concentration of oxygen results in a large amount of
adsorbed oxygen, thus hindering the adsorption of the monosaccharides and limiting the
reaction.
Consequently, for both arabinose and glucose, the application of equation (8) results in
ùëõùëÇ2 values of approximately 1.2¬±1 (Fig. 3.20). When investigating the rates in Table 3.6, it
also becomes apparent that oxidation of arabinose is slightly more sensitive to the concentration
of oxygen compared to oxidation of glucose.

In terms of selectivity, compared to the high selectivity at 0.125 atm, significantly lower
selectivity to gluconic acid was achieved at 0.250 atm, followed by 0.0625 atm. Because
arabinose is the favored adsorbed molecule, the high oxygen content at 0.250 atm may induce
less available sites, which further hinders glucose adsorption and oxidation and instead
enhances fructose formation. Additionally, this hypothesis would be supported by the high
selectivity to arabinonic acid observed at all oxygen pressures.

3.2.7 Catalyst stability
Catalyst deactivation implies a loss of catalytic activity and/or selectivity over time. A stable
catalyst shows no or very minimal catalyst deactivation. Catalyst stability is important from
both an economic point of view and practical viewpoints.
Reasons for catalyst deactivation in heterogeneous solid ‚Äì liquid reactions can be coking,
meaning the formation of carbon on the catalyst surface, sintering of the metal particles to larger
clusters due to high temperatures, leaching of the active metal into the liquid phase, poisoning
and transformations of the active phase, e.g. oxidation of the metal. As mentioned in Section
1.2, gold has the advantage of not over-oxidizing by oxygen. pH affects not only the rate, but
also the stability of Au catalysts, i.e. lower pH shortens the catalyst lifetime, reportedly [48].
Occasionally, deactivated catalysts can be regenerated to improve activity, for example, coke
can be burnt off. The initial catalytic activity is, however, usually never retained. On the
contrary, leaching and sintering are generally irreversible.
In continuous systems, catalyst deactivation can easily be detected by decreased conversion or
change in selectivity. For batch reactions, the catalyst is recycled and used again in a reaction
with the same conditions. In the current work, 0.1 g 1% Au/Al2O3-B catalyst was used in the
oxidation reaction with the mass ratio of 1:1 for the arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixture at 70 ¬∞C, pH
8 and pO2 = 0.125 atm. After the reaction, the catalyst was washed and recycled. The recycled
dry catalyst weighted 0.086 g and the loss in catalyst mass was considered by multiplying time
with the mass of gold. For graphical comparison, the results are displayed in Fig. 3.21.

Sebastian Franz
to Section 3.1, where it was observed that the spent catalyst did not contain as many large
particles as the fresh catalyst, a strong hypothesis was leaching of Au into the liquid. ICP-MS
analysis, however, showed only very minor content of gold in the liquid close to the lower limit
of detection (Appendix VI). Therefore, catalyst coking is suspected, which should be further
investigated.

3.3 Kinetic modelling
A well-structured model for catalytic arabinose oxidation has earlier been demonstrated by
Correia et al. [13], which is partially based on the model presented by Kusema et al. [49]. In
this work, the presented model was used as a basis and extended for the simultaneous oxidation
of arabinose and glucose. The routes in the model presented in [13] are inspired by the oxidation
routes of glucose. Hence, no interferences regarding the use of this model as a basis for the
modelling of the simultaneous oxidation of arabinose and glucose were concluded. The reaction
routes and steps are listed in Table 3.8 for which the nomenclature is found in Table 3.7.

For both arabinose and glucose, two mechanisms have been developed for the oxidation to their
corresponding aldonic acids and subsequently to their anionic form. For glucose, the
mechanism contains three routes Ni and four routes for arabinose. Additionally, the
36

Sebastian Franz
isomerization process of glucose to fructose and the potential isomerization of arabinose to
ribulose are also considered as routes.
All adsorption ‚Äì desorption reaction steps (1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 15, 18, 23, 26, 28) are considered to
rapidly be at quasi-equilibrium, not significantly influencing the overall reaction rates [13].
Reaction steps 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 17, 20, 22 and 25 are expected to be fast, not affecting the rates.
Hence, in route NI , reflecting the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid proceeding via the
lactone form, the critical step is the reaction between adsorbed glucose and adsorbed molecular
oxygen (step 3). Under the reaction conditions used in this work, oxygen is considered to be
molecular adsorbed, as stated in [50]. Routes NII and NIII describe the mechanism starting from
acyclic glucose. In NII , glucose is via a nucleophilic attack in alkaline environment rapidly
converted to its aldehydrol form. The step determining the rate of the route is the nucleophilic
attack (step 8). Route NIII reflects the subsequent oxidation of the adsorbed aldehydrol (step
11). Route NIV reflects the homogeneous catalyzed isomerization of glucose to fructose.
The fifth route, NV , describes the oxidation of arabinose to arabino-Œ¥-lactone. After the reaction
between arabinofuranose and oxygen (step 16), both in adsorbed state, the ring of the resulting
arabino-Œ≥-lactone is rapidly conformed to arabino-Œ¥‚Äìlactone as an intermediate. Route NVI
reflects the subsequent ring-opening of the lactone in alkaline environment (step 19) and is a
reaction with H2O. However, as water is in excess, the reaction is dependent on the availability
of hydroxide [13].
Routes NVII and NVIII represent the oxidation of arabinose proceeding via the aldehydrol of
arabinose. First, arabinose is attacked by a nucleophile, hydroxide, and converted to its
aldehydrol (step 21). Subsequently, the adsorbed aldehydrol reacts with oxygen to arabinonic
acid (step 24) and later to arabinonate in route NVII . Finally, NIX reflects the heterogeneously
catalyzed isomerization of arabinose to ribulose.
Reaction steps 4, 12, 16 and 24 give hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. It is, however,
noteworthy that during analysis no H2O2 was detected, presumably due to its unstable nature in
aqueous and alkaline environment.

Accordingly, the kinetic model comprises of the critical steps: furanose oxidations (steps 3 and
15), aldehydrol formations (steps 8 and 21) aldehydrol oxidations (steps 11 and 24) as well as
the ring-opening of arabino-Œ¥-lactone (step 19) and the isomerization to fructose (step 14) and
ribulose (step 27). On this basis, the rate equations are derived (10)-(18).

However, due to the excessive overlapping of peaks
during analysis, several components were not possible
to quantify. Thus, simplification of the model is
necessary where only the most substantial reactions are
regarded (Table 3.9). The model is stripped down to
only involve the reaction of glucose and arabinose with

estimation was done by numerically solving the differential equations (52)-(56) with the
Simplex method. The best parameter estimation is achieved at the closest correspondence
between the estimated fit and the obtained parameters (Fig. 3.22-Fig. 3.24). Thus, the objective
function ùëÑ is set by maximizing the degree of explanation ùëÖ 2 (57). The latter is described by
the ratio of the squared difference in the experimental (ùëêùëíùë•ùëù ) and the estimated (ùëêùëíùë†ùë° )
concentration values, and the square of the differences between ùëêùëíùë•ùëù and the mean of the

The results show that with the values from the parameter estimation are presented in Table 3.10,
the simplified model fits the experimental data well with a 97.33% degree of explanation.
Although high explanation was confirmed, important to note is that the results display relatively
high standard deviations of the parameter values. However, the rate constants for the
isomerization processes are minimal compared to the oxidation reactions, allowing to conclude
that only minor formations of fructose and ribulose occur in mixtures as well. Important to note
is that the experiment with oxygen pressure 0.250 atm was left out during model estimation, as
the mass balance closure was inadequate and hence interfering with the other data fitting.
The higher value of the equilibrium constant for arabinose confirms that arabinose adsorption
is more favored over glucose. Furthermore, the more significant effect of temperature for
arabinose oxidation is also confirmed by the higher activation energy value compared to
glucose.

Parameters

Table 3.11 describes how the parameters are correlated to each other, i.e. how one parameter is
affected by a change of another parameter value. A high correlation close to 1 indicates that the
parameter values are unreliable. In Table 3.11, the highest correlation found is 0.988, while
most of the correlations are significantly lower. Hence, the reliability of the estimated
parameters can be considered as satisfying.

4 CONCLUSIONS
Because of the global trend to shift from fossil to bio-based feedstock, the valorization of
chemical compounds from biomass is an essential implementation in the concept of biorefining,
which oxidation of derived monosaccharides is part of. In this work, aerobic oxidation of
arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures over gold nanoparticles in a batch reactor at constant pH has
successfully been conducted. A great correlation between catalyst particle size and catalytic
activity was observed, giving that catalysts with particles of sizes close to 2-3 nm are favored
for aldose oxidation reactions. High dp for carbon-supported catalysts resulted in low or no
activity. Consequently, catalysts supported on Al2O3 showing significantly lower ùëëùëù are more
suitable for oxidation reactions.
Oxidation reactions of arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures over 1% Au/Al2O3-B revealed that
oxidation of arabinose (C5) is more favored compared to glucose (C6) under all conditions
investigated. Computed results confirmed a more favored adsorption of arabinose. Furthermore,
studies of mutarotational processes show a higher content of reactive components for arabinose
under investigated conditions.
Due to mutarotation, the highest productivity is obtained with arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures
with 3:1 mass ratio (0.78:0.22 molar ratio). From aldose-to-gold molar ratios of 24200:1 and
above, the rate is not limited by mass transfer processes. Furthermore, arabinose oxidation
shows higher influence by catalyst loading. Oxidation reactions of arabinose ‚Äì glucose mixtures
with 1:1 mass ratio (0.55:0.45 molar ratio) under varying conditions of temperature, pH and
oxygen pressure, rate maxima were achieved at 70 ¬∞C, pH 8 and 0.125 atm. For arabinose, the
results at 60 ¬∞C and 70 ¬∞C were identical while for glucose, the results were identical for oxygen
pressure 0.125 atm and 0.250 atm. At these conditions, the reaction order of both arabinose and
glucose oxidation was close to 0th order. For deeper understanding of the influence of oxygen
pressure, further experiments have to be conducted.
Overall, high selectivity to the corresponding aldonic acids was achieved under all conditions.
These highest selectivity of almost 100% to both arabinonic acid and gluconic acid,
respectively, was achieved at the above-mentioned conditions, i.e. 70 ¬∞C, pH 8 and 0.125 atm
oxygen pressure, thus making them most suitable for the reaction. Temperatures over 70 ¬∞C
induce catalyst deactivation and pH values above 8 enhance the formation of by-products,
especially for glucose. Thus, for optimal selectivity, only a narrow condition interval is
47

Sebastian Franz
available. Further investigations showed that catalyst deactivation after washing process
prohibits recycling of the catalyst.
Due to analytical issues, a simplified model had to be derived with only the main reactions and
isomerization processes, thus excluding any intermediate steps. The model was confirmed to
fit the experimental data well with an R2 of 97.33%.

SWEDISH SUMMARY ‚Äì SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Under de senaste √•rtiondena har till f√∂ljd av klimatf√∂r√§ndringen och minskade tillg√•ngar
trenden att fr√•ng√• fossila br√§nslen och r√•material √∂kat massivt. Konceptet f√∂r utnyttjandet av
biomassa f√∂r att ers√§tta fossila motsvarande har blivit av stort intresse och forskning inom
omr√•det √§r h√∂gaktuell. Idag anv√§nds biomassa fr√§mst f√∂r att framst√§lla energi genom
f√∂rbr√§nning. F√∂r utnyttjandet av biomassans kemiska inneh√•ll och egenskaper finns alternativa
metoder som pyrolys, f√∂rgasning, extraktion och hydrolys.
Lignocellulosa, dvs. torr biomassa, best√•r av tre delar: cellulosa, hemicellulosa och lignin. De
tv√• f√∂rstn√§mnda best√•r av sackarider. Cellulosa inneh√•ller endast polymerkedjor av glukos som
best√•r av sex kolatomer (C6), medan hemicellulosa √§r ett samlingsnamn och kan best√• av olika
l√§nkade monosackarider med b√•de fem (C5) och sex (C6) kolatomer. Arabinogalaktan har
exempelvis en ryggrad av Œ≤-D-galaktos med f√∂rgreningar av Œ≤-D-galaktos, Œ±-L-arabinos och
glukonsyra. Genom hydrolys fraktioneras polysackariderna i biomassan till monosackarider.
Dessa monosackarider utg√∂r en bas f√∂r vidare kemikalieframst√§llning ur biomassa. Hydrering
av aldoser (glukos, arabinos, galaktos) ger motsvarande alditoler och vice versa resulterar
oxidering i bildningen av syror, endera aldonsyror, uronsyror eller aldariska syror (eng. aldonic
acids, uronic acids, aldaric acids). Dessa syror anv√§nds i bland annat matprodukter, kosmetika
och l√§kemedelsprodukter.
Framf√∂rallt den katalytiska oxideringen av glukos har tidigare studerats intensivt. Ut√∂ver det
visade Kusema et al. hydreringen av arabinogalaktan samt separat oxidering av arabinos och
galaktos. Ytterligare publicerades studier om hydrering av sockerblandningar i arbetet av
Herrera et al. Inga studier om oxideringen av sockerblandningar har dock publicerats, vilket
g√∂rs i det h√§r arbetet.
Oxideringen av glukos (C6) har i tidigare studier rapporterats genom b√•de heterogena och
enzymatiska katalytiska processer. Enzymer uppvisar dock nackdelar n√§r det kommer till
f√∂rvaring och anv√§ndningsf√∂rh√•llanden. I litteratur om oxidering av arabinos (C5) har tidigare
alltid anv√§nts heterogena katalysatorer som bland annat platina, palladium och guld. Nackdelen
med de tv√• f√∂rstn√§mnda har dock konstaterats vara √∂veroxidering av metallen, vilket leder till
att katalysatorn inaktiveras. Guld har bevisats att undg√• detta fenomen och √§r f√∂rdelaktigt f√∂r
oxideringsreaktioner, varf√∂r det anv√§nts i det h√§r arbetet.

I vattenl√∂sningar upptr√§der b√•de glukos och arabinos i olika former: en √∂ppen form och fyra
ringstrukturer, Œ±-och Œ≤-pyranos samt Œ±- och Œ≤-furanos. Pyranos √§r i majoritet medan den √∂ppna
formen och furanosformerna upptr√§der i endast marginella m√§ngder och √§r mera instabila
komponenter. De instabila egenskaperna antyder att det √§r den √∂ppna och furanosformerna som
√§r de aktiva komponenterna i reaktionen. D√§rav uppst√•r tv√• oxidationsreaktionsrutter f√∂r
vardera sackariden. Den ena rutten g√•r √∂ver den ringformade furanosstrukturen som adsorberas
vid katalysatorn och oxideras till aldonens lakton. Efter desorption fr√•n katalysatorn inducerar
den basiska milj√∂n √∂ppningen av ringstrukturen och aldonsyra erh√•lls, som i basisk milj√∂
dehydreras till glukonat. Den andra rutten f√∂rl√∂per √∂ver den √∂ppna formen, som i basisk milj√∂
katalyseras till aldehydrol. Denna adsorberas p√• katalysatorn, oxideras till glukonsyra och
desorberas. Igen √∂verg√•r glukonsyra till glukonat i det basiska mediet.

fungerade som inert.
Skillnaderna i katalysatorb√§rare framg√•r fr√§mst ur den aktiva metallens partikelstorlek p√•
katalysatorn. Inverkan av partikelstorleken √§r av stor vikt eftersom oxideringsreaktioner har
visats vara starkt p√•verkade av den. Katalysatorns aktivitet √§r beroende av temperatur och pH,
samtidigt som pH √§ven inverkar p√• produkterna. Eftersom syre beh√∂vs f√∂r oxidering var
reaktionen beroende av tillg√•ngen till syre samt ledig katalysator, som p√•verkades av m√§ngden
katalysator i reaktionen.
Resultaten visar att oxideringen av arabinos var klart effektivare √§n glukosoxidering i samtliga
sammanhang. Guldpartikelstorleken p√• de analyserade kolbaserade katalysatorb√§rarna (b√•de 1
viktprocent och 2 viktprocent Au) var klart h√∂gre √§n f√∂r Al2O3-katalysatorb√§rare med 1
viktprocent Au. Oxideringsreaktioner under identiska f√∂rh√•llanden visade j√§mf√∂rbara resultat
med mycket h√∂gre reaktionshastigheter f√∂r Au/Al2O3-katalysatorer. Den mest aktiva
katalysatorn visade en partikelstorleksf√∂rdelning f√∂r partiklar ‚â§ 10 nm p√• 2,63 nm. Denna
katalysator anv√§ndes f√∂r samtliga fortsatta parameterunders√∂kningar i studien. Betr√§ffande
