Title: Knowledge Transfer in Mergers and Acquisitions, Contribution of Social Integration and
the Role of Management
Supervisor: Gunilla Widén

Abstract:
Mergers and acquisitions have since the 1920s been a growing trend for companies to expand
their business. Despite their popularity, the majority of mergers and acquisitions are considered
failures. Reasons for failures were traditionally linked to financial and strategic issues.
However, human and organisational culture related issues have increasingly gained recognition
since the 1980s, with poorly managed post-acquisition/merger integrations being attributed to
failures as well. Recently companies engaging in mergers and acquisitions have focused on
gaining strategic rather that financial growth. In today’s knowledge intense society, knowledge
can be considered an organisation’s most important strategic asset, placing knowledge
management in the centre of mergers and acquisitions.
This thesis contributes to research by evaluating how organisational culture and social and
managerial actions contribute to knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions. More
specifically, this thesis aims to evaluate how social integration contributes to knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions and what is management’s role in building a culture
supporting knowledge transfer. The literature review provides an overview of mergers and
acquisitions, the role of organisational culture and issues surfacing in post-acquisition/merger
integrations. The literature review also presents knowledge management as a concept, its role in
mergers and acquisitions and human and culture related issues affecting knowledge transfer.
The research of this thesis is based on a post-acquisition integration process from the acquiring
company’s perspective. Research aimed through in-depth interviews to evaluate how social
integration affected knowledge transfer by assessing employees’ experiences in locating and
applying knowledge. Results indicated social integration contributes to knowledge transfer by
affecting employees’ willingness and ability to accept, locate and apply knowledge from the
acquired company. The role of management was evaluated by assessing how managements’
actions during the integration affected the integration. Based on findings, lack of support and
resources impacted knowledge transfer negatively by hindering employees’ ability to focus on
core tasks and limiting opportunities to become acquainted with the acquired company. Results
therefore indicated that the role of management is to acknowledge cultural differences and
provide sufficient support and resources for the integration.

1 Introduction

1.1 Area of Research
Since the 1920’s companies have invested significant amounts investments into mergers
and acquisitions (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). The success rate of mergers and
acquisitions has however been poor, with fewer than 50% being profitable (Gupta,
2010). A number of reasons for merger and acquisitions failures have been identified,
but the majority of research indicates towards poor management of postmerger/acquisition integration (Lakshman, 2011).
More specifically, personnel related issues surfacing during integrations have
increasingly been identified as reason for failures in mergers and acquisitions
(Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). Research indicates, personnel related issues are often
overlooked by management in mergers and acquisitions as they are perceived as soft,
unquantifiable and difficult to manage with focus being placed more on financial and
strategic issues. Although personnel related issues in mergers and acquisitions is a
largely researched topic, concrete tools and framework for managing them is scarce
(Gupta, 2010).
Organisational culture gained recognition as the source of personnel issues in mergers
and acquisitions in the 1980’s (Sherman & Hart, 2006) with knowledge management
gaining relevance in the 1990’s with its importance in mergers and acquisitions being
identified as well (Lyytinen, Heo & Yoo, 2007). Research on the effects of
organisational culture has focused mainly on issues in combining differing cultures in
mergers and acquisitions with research on knowledge management focusing on issues in
knowledge transfer. Most recently correlation between the two has been evaluated.
Knowledge transfer is highly dependent on individuals (Hislop, 2013) and since
individuals’ behavioural patterns are equally influenced by organisational culture
(Cartwright & Cooper, 1992), its effects on knowledge transfer need to be assessed
separately (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).

1.2 Overall Aim of the Thesis and Research Questions
In today’s knowledge society, companies are increasingly engaging in mergers and
acquisitions in order to gain new knowledge (Kongpichayanond, 2009). Successfully
transferring knowledge can therefore be considered a key value creator in mergers and
acquisitions (Junni, 2012). Organisational culture is argued to either hinder or support
knowledge transfer in mergers. It is also argued that cultural differences to a certain
extent support knowledge transfer in post-merger/acquisition integration. This support
is however somewhat dependent on managerial implications such as social and
operational integration.
This thesis aims to contribute to research on knowledge transfer in postmerger/acquisition integrations by evaluating the effects of organisational culture on
knowledge transfer. More specifically this research aims to evaluate how the role of
management and the level of social integration contribute to knowledge transfer in postmerger/acquisition integration. The research questions this study aims to answer thereby
are:
-

Research question 1: How does social integration contribute to knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions?

-

Research question 2: What is the role of management in shaping a culture
supporting knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions?

The thesis is based on the post-acquisition integration process of two comparatively
large companies operating within the same industry. The companies had little
overlapping operations prior to the acquisition, meaning that their services were
complimentary. The study is focused on the human resource department of the
acquiring organisation and was conducted through a qualitative approach consisting of
interviews with four members of the human resource department.

1.3. Study Object
Cultural issues and issues with knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions have
been assessed separately in literature but research on the causal-effects of the two is
6

Jutta Viskari
scarce. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the effects of culture on knowledge transfer,
although the author acknowledges there are multiple other factors affecting the process.
The decision was made to limit the study on the human resource department of the
acquiring company as majority of the work in executing the post-acquisition integration
was placed on this department. The number of employees increased significantly due to
the acquisition and inflicted numerous adjustments to the acquiring company’s human
resource processes. Since the two organisations had little overlapping operations, the
integration also meant in addition to adjusting existing processes, creating new ones.
The interviews aimed to obtain an overview of the combining organisational cultures
and how potential differences in cultures affected transferring knowledge by assessing
how interviewees experienced the integration.
The number of interviewees was chosen based on the overall size of the human resource
department and were selected from different levels of the department, in order to gain a
comprehensive overview of the integration effects on said department. The interviews
consisted of a few premeditated open-ended questions, since the overall aim of
interviews were to create open conversation in order to gain in-depth information based
on the interviewees’ personal experiences and perceptions.

1.4 Structure of the Thesis
This thesis begins with a literature review. The literature review provides an overview
of mergers and acquisitions, general history of the phenomena, motivations behind it
and categorisations. Following this, is an overview of organisational culture and how
the concept affects mergers and acquisitions. The literature review then proceeds to
assess post-merger/acquisition integration and general issues surfacing during the
process. Lastly the literature review provides and overview of knowledge management
as a concept, further assessing it in the context of mergers and acquisitions.
The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of mergers and acquisitions as a
phenomena and commonly recognised challenges during them. Organisational culture
and its role in mergers and acquisitions are assessed in-depth since it represents the
basis for the study. As the research is situated on a post-acquisition integration, an
7

Jutta Viskari
introduction to the subject is necessary. The integration chapter also provides a short
description of generally identified issues during the process, from a managerial
perspective as the study aims to evaluate the effects of managerial implications. An indepth overview of knowledge management and its role in mergers and acquisitions is
necessary to support the knowledge management approach of the study.
After the literature review the thesis proceeds to present chosen study methods and
study object. Methodology chapter provides and overview and justification of the
chosen study methods and sampling strategy. Following this an outline of the two
combining companies, timeline and overview of the acquisition, integration process and
the studied department is given. The operations of both companies are described in
detail to support understanding of the area of research. The results of the study are
analysed and interpreted in chapter 4 with results being further categorised into five
main themes identified during the interviews in relevance to subject of the study.
Results and their reflection to the literature review are discussed in the discussion
chapter. The discussion chapter also provides answer to the research questions. Finally
suggestions for further research and limitations to the study are made.

2 Literature Review
The purpose of this thesis is to understand the role of management in building a culture
supporting knowledge transfer and how social integration contributes to knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions. To understand how these factors relate to
knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions, what first needs to assessed is the
concept of mergers and acquisitions. This chapter therefore begins with an overview of
mergers and acquisitions as a phenomenon. Secondly, an overview of the role of
organisational culture in mergers and acquisitions is provided in order to understand
how deeply organisational cultures affect organisations and what challenges in
combining cultures may occur during mergers and acquisitions. Assessing
organisational culture as a separate concept is crucial to the study as both research
questions are highly linked to the concept. Mergers and acquisitions are more often
followed by integration a process, on which this thesis is also centred around. Therefore
integration as a process and the most commonly faced issues during it are covered
within the literature review as well. Lastly, the literature review provides and overview
of knowledge management in mergers and acquisitions. Knowledge management in
mergers and acquisitions is largely focused on knowledge transfer which is the main
theme of this thesis. However in order to fully understand knowledge transfer, one
needs to understand the concept of knowledge management. Therefore a brief overview
of knowledge management is provided followed by an in-depth assessment of
knowledge managements’ role in mergers and acquisitions.

2.1 Mergers and Acquisitions
Section 2.1 focuses on defining mergers and acquisitions. History of mergers and
acquisitions is presented briefly, followed by an outline of the motives behind of
mergers and acquisitions. Lastly an overview the most common categorisations of
merger and acquisition types are provided.

2.1.1 History of Mergers and Acquisitions
“A merger is a combination of two corporations in which only one corporation survives
and the merged corporation goes out of existence. In a merger, the acquiring company
assumes the assets and liabilities of the merged company.” (Gaughan, 2014, p. 12)
Mergers and acquisitions have been a growing trend for roughly 30 years. According to
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) mergers have occurred in waves, the first being in
1920s’, with the next wave taking place in the 1960s and a significant wave during the
1980s’. According to Gaughan (2014), the next two waves in the 1990s and the most
recent in the early 2000s were both record setting and different in comparison to not
only each other, but also to prior waves. The wave of mergers and acquisitions in the
1990s came to a halt due to the recession which took placed in 1990-1991 but picked up
soon after in 1993-1994 shading the 1980s wave with what Gaughan (2014) refers to as
an era of “megamergers” and cross-border deals. What set the 2000s wave apart from its
predecessors was that it was truly international, involving a great deal of European and
Asian organisations, when the phenomena had previously been mainly focused in the
United States.
During the 2000s, the amount of mergers and acquisitions declined in the U.S. but
increased in European markets. Another recession however beginning in January 2008
caused again a pause in mergers and acquisitions, resulting in ongoing deals being
reigned in and recently made deals being renegotiated, or even cancelled (Gaughan,
2014). Since 2008, merger and acquisition activity has remained turbulent, with the
phenomena fluctuating along with global economy (Gleich, Hasselback & Kierans,
2010). Within recent years the phenomenon has become increasingly strategic with
mergers and acquisitions being executed to gain strategic growth for both parties, rather
than financial growth for the acquiring party. Although challenges surfacing during
mergers and acquisitions are increasingly acknowledged (Sherman, 2018) the
phenomenon is ongoing and companies thirst towards mergers and acquisitions is
unlikely to decline (Gleich, Hasselback & Kierans, 2010).
Due to the long history and popularity of mergers and acquisitions there exists vast
amount of research and knowledge on the topic. However it is increasingly
acknowledged that mergers and acquisitions are plagued with difficulties and despite
their popularity, understanding on difficulties emerging during them is limited.

2.1.2 Merger Categories
Mergers are commonly categorised into three categories: horizontal, vertical and
conglomerate. A horizontal merger is a merger in which two organisations operating
within the same field (Gaughan, 2014) and within same or similar stages of production
unite (Gupta, 2010). The aim and benefit of horizontal mergers is achieving economies
of scale by combining overlapping operations, diversifying products and services,
reducing employee and advertising costs and altogether gaining improved control over
the market (Gupta 2010). Horizontal mergers are regulated by government owned
entities and are evaluated by them if an organisation risks gaining a too much power
over a market. Government regulations hinder the creation of monopolies (Gaughan,
2014) or oligopolies with one organisation gaining all, or most of the power over a
certain market (Gupta, 2010).
A vertical merger is a merger between two organisations in different stages of
production (Gupta, 2010), meaning they operate within same industry but in different
fields. Companies involved in a vertical merger could for instance be engaged in a
buyer-seller relationship with the acquiring company focusing on production and the
target on distribution (Gaughan, 2014). Vertical mergers are appealing to organisations
as provide monetary savings in processes previously having to be outsourced (Gupta,
2010). Vertical mergers are not similarly regulated by government entities but do
contain risks as companies expand into operations outside their core competencies
(Gaughan, 2014).
A conglomerate merger occurs when companies operating in unrelated businesses and
stages of production combine. The motive behind conglomerates is usually
diversification through expanding a company’s business portfolio (Gupta, 2010). A
company can also resort to a conglomerate when experiencing a decline in their own
line of business due to market changes. According to Gaughan (2014), conglomerates
have a track-record of being unsuccessful whereas horizontal and vertical mergers tend
to be more successful since organisations are able to transfer existing knowledge and
knowhow to the acquired organisation (Gupta, 2010).

11

Jutta Viskari
In addition to mergers and acquisitions, companies can engage in takeovers. Takeovers
differ from mergers and acquisitions in terms of how willing a company is to be
acquired. During a takeover a company obtains control over another company by
acquiring control over its assets either directly or indirectly, usually by acquiring most
of the company’s shares. The motives behind takeovers are the same as in mergers and
acquisitions (Baker & Kiymaz, 2011).

2.1.3 Motives behind Mergers and Acquisitions
Successful mergers and acquisitions are an increasingly effective way for organisations
to “get rich quick” and therefore their amount is unlikely to decline as they are an
appealing option for companies to grow along with internal growth (Junni, 2012).
The main reason behind organisations’ interest in mergers and acquisitions is the
constantly changing market and increasing competition. According to Cartwright and
Cooper (1992) organisations are due to the rapidness of changes hesitant to invest in
long term internal growth. A new production unit, requiring multiple years and large
investments in resources, may become obsolete in a few years and is therefore not as
appealing of an investment as mergers and acquisitions (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
The aim of mergers and acquisitions is to create synergies. The extent to which
synergies are reached has been recognised as source of value in mergers and
acquisitions. Synergies are achieved when combining companies are able to create more
value together than separately (Gaughan, 2014).
According to Junni (2012) there exist multiple types of synergies depending on the type
of merger/acquisition. Cost-based synergies aim towards economies of scale or scope
through diversification of assets and other capital. Revenue-based synergies are created
through combining assets of merging companies reaching towards innovation and
increased market share. Revenue-based synergies leverage on target companies’ skills
complementary to the acquiring organisation’s knowledge. Both cost- and revenuebased synergies require a level of integration as opposed to market- and financial
power-synergies which aim towards gaining power through price control, volume and
size (Junni, 2012).

12

Jutta Viskari
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) also refer to unstated psychological motives behind
mergers and acquisitions since motives behind an acquisition are not always in fact to
gain long term financial benefits for a company, but gaining individual benefits.
Individuals such as managers can make advances towards acquisitions in the fear of
becoming obsolete. Decisions to expand through acquisitions and mergers can resonate
positively towards the individual making these decisions. The outcome of the decisions
is not significant, as it is likely for these individuals to have moved on by the time the
actual financial outcomes of an acquisition or merger are revealed. These decisionmakers tend to also be situated far from the actual managerial work involved in postmerger/acquisition integration and therefore success cannot necessarily be perceived as
their responsibility (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).

2.2 The Role of Organisational Culture in Mergers and Acquisitions
Studies focusing on organisational culture have recognised that cultural differences are
directly related to multiple issues emerging in mergers and acquisitions (Junni, 2012)
also linking cultural synergies to value creation (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). Goulet
and Schweiger (2007) state although effects of organisational culture are recognised in
mergers/acquisitions, little effort has been placed in understanding the issue and how to
manage it. “Significant gaps remain in our understanding of how cultural
understanding can be achieved to help bridge cultural differences and promote cultural
acceptance between combining firms as they converge on a shared culture” (Goulet &
Schweiger, 2007, p. 2).
Organisational culture is according to Goulet and Schweiger (2007) a deeply rooted set
of shared values, goals, roles norms and customs followed by employees.
Characteristics of organisational culture are often unacknowledged by employees but
impact largely how business is conducted (Goulet & Schweiger, 2007) and can be
difficult to change or mould (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). Cartwright and Cooper
(1992) further argue organisational culture affects all aspects of how business is
conducted from how work is organised and communicated, how performance of
employees is evaluated, to how employees dress and speak to one another. National
cultures impact organisational culture to a certain extent but, organisational cultures
13

Jutta Viskari
within the same nationality can differ and therefore need to be assessed separately
(Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007). The description of an organisational culture is similar
to the description of a national culture, similarly shaped by the history and the founders
of the company. Other determinants of organisational culture are the field in which a
company operates in, its size and used technologies. The size of a company also
determines the amount of subcultures formed throughout the organisation, in its
divisions and departments (Schein & Schein, 2017)
Mergers and acquisitions are often compared to marriage and from the perspective of
organisational culture two companies need to be compatible in cultures for the marriage
to work (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). Moderate cultural differences can in optimal
scenarios offer new and useful perspectives for companies, but large cultural distances
can cause opposite results, hindering creation of complimentary operations (Björkman,
Stahl & Vaara, 2007).
According to Gupta (2010) acquiring organisation's culture is often unintendedly
perceived as superior to target organisation’s culture, enforcing disruptive “us vs. them”
categorisations. Goulet and Schweiger (2007) further note that this is particularly
typical in horizontal mergers when both organisations are operating within the same
field, possessing similar first-hand knowledge on the industry. Perceptions of
superiority result from lack of knowledge on the other company’s culture. Unequal
perceptions of cultures may lead to conflicts, negative attitudes towards the integration
and mistrust in its management (Goulet & Schweiger, 2007).
Organisational cultures are likely to clash during mergers and acquisitions without
competent management, but even more so if organisational cultures are ill matched
(Goulet & Schweiger, 2007). Gupta (2010) states clashing cultures may lead to culture
shock among employees potentially causing a significant and extended impact on their
performance. Since cultural collisions can be costly and may lead to severe personnel
issues, Goulet and Schweiger (2007) go as far as suggesting only companies with
relatively similar organisational cultures should be combined.
According to Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) people are by nature inclined to a
“them vs. us” mind-set due to which employees may perceive outside members
negatively. Since initial merger/acquisition negotiations are usually confined to a select
14

Jutta Viskari
group of people taking behind closed doors, evaluations of external cultures are in
preliminary stages often based on rumours. Assessments during these stages are
unlikely to be made in positive spirits, often focusing more on cultural differences,
rather than similarities. Employees tend to also idealise their own organisational culture
noticeably more during mergers and acquisitions, leading to an even more negative
perception of external cultures (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).
Similarities in organisational cultures mitigate the probability of cultural clashes as
employees are more likely to be attracted to external cultures with similarities.
Similarities in cultural traits also increase level of trust among employees motivating
them towards creating a combined culture (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).

2.2.1 Organisational Culture Types
A number of researches exist on different organisational culture types. The chosen
categorisation to this thesis identifies four main types of organisational culture: power,
role, task/achievement and person/support (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
Power cultures
Distribution of power is essential to power cultures with power usually resting with one
individual e.g. founder of the company or within highest management. Individuals with
power enjoy the respect of employees and such cultures are typically described as
hierarchical or old-fashioned. Power culture organisations tend to have uneven levels of
salaries and reward systems which are linked to level of performance and longitude of
service reflecting loyalty towards the company and its leader. Power cultures are further
divided into two sub-categories: patriarchal and autocratic power cultures. The two are
differentiated based on the background of the individual with presumed power. Power
in patriarchal power cultures, rests in the hands of an individual with strong
commitment to the company, either through ownership or other personal stake. The
individual is thus more personally invested in the future of the organisation and usually
highly valued by employees.
Power in autocratic cultures lays similarly either with one person or a selected group of
individuals but these individuals are not personally invested in future of the
organisation. Therefore these individuals are not as valued by employees and
15

Jutta Viskari
consequently the working environment in companies with autocratic power cultures is
often described as dissatisfying (Cartwright and Cooper, 1992).
Role cultures
Role cultures are characterised by the definitive organisational roles of employees. Role
cultures aim towards maximised efficiency and are often encountered in large
organisations. Role cultures however efficient are usually plagued with bureaucracy, are
slow to change and adapt slowly to changing environments. Employees following
company rules are praised for doing so. Role cultures offer security and stability for
employees but the inflexibility of the organisation can be frustrating to some
(Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
Task cultures
Task cultures can be viewed as opposite of role cultures. Employees in
task/achievement cultures are committed to completing tasks with little concern to how
they are completed. Emphasis is placed on what is achieved rather than how it is
achieved. Task cultures lack corporate rules and standards but are highly flexible and
enable creativity. Task cultures are team oriented and departments tend to have varying
cultures and manners of conducting business. Organisations with task cultures lack
control and can therefore be hard to manage in challenging circumstances. As
employees have autonomy and are often personally invested in their work, individuals
may also become overworked and experience burnouts. Task cultures are often
encountered in start-ups and younger organisations (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
Person/support cultures
Person/support cultures are most common in non-profit organisations. Person/support
cultures are more concerned with supporting growth of its individuals rather than
growth of the organisation. General environment of organisations with person/support
cultures is collective and knowledge about each aspect of the organisation is shared
openly (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).

16

Jutta Viskari
2.2.2 Social Integration and Organisational Culture
Social integration was originally defined as “the degree to which group members are
psychologically linked or attracted toward interacting with one another in pursuit of a
common objective” (Briel, Schneider & Lowry, 2019 p. 17). Björkman, Stahl and Vaara
(2007, p. 5) have further defined the concept as “the creation of a shared identity, the
establishment of trusting relationships, and the absence of divisive conflicts between the
members of the combining organisations”.
Briel, Schneider and Lowry (2019) argue that social integration is crucial for companies
engaging in merger and acquisition activities in an attempt to acquire new knowledge.
Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) identify social integration as an essential part of
successfully combining two organisational cultures. Similarly connecting social
integration to culture, Junni (2012) refers to social integration as socio-cultural
integration due to the embeddedness of organisational culture in employees’
professional identities. According to Junni (2012) scholars have in recent years
increasingly turned focus towards post-acquisition social integration and its effects on
merger/acquisition outcomes. Studies on the effects of social integration have however
mainly focused on the target instead of the acquiring company (Junni, 2012) and lack
sufficient definition of the concept (Briel, Schneider & Lowry, 2019).
Social integration consists of multiple dimensions, with Briel, Schneider and Lowry,
(2019) identifying four dimensions to the concept: the environmental, the affective, the
cognitive and the behavioural dimension. The environmental dimension refers to
resources such as time and space, enabling interaction between individuals during
mergers and acquisitions. The affective dimension refers to how individuals perceive
one another. Perceptions are crucial as social integration is likely to be more successful
if employees are attracted the combining company. The cognitive dimension refers to
common ground shared by individuals, enabling social integration. Common ground
such as shared language and similar operations contribute to the cognitive dimension.
Lastly, the behavioural dimension refers to a shared vision or goal between individuals
clarifying roles and supporting co-operation (Briel, Schneider & Lowry, 2019).
According to Briel, Schneider and Lowry (2019) although the dimensions are likely to
be interrelated they can separately contribute to successful social integration.
17

Jutta Viskari

Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) argue that through social integration and proper
management joining companies can mitigate common cultural issues, supporting the
creation of a combined culture. As means of implementing social integration Björkman,
Stahl and Vaara (2007) suggest techniques such as rotating employees, visitations,
executing joint training programmes and creating task forces or cross organisation units.
Such activities according to Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) have shown to increase
levels of trust among employees, supporting the creation of a combined culture.
Junni (2012) further notes as means of implementing social integration competent
management, visible social integration and extensive communication, emphasising the
role of management. Managing social integration during mergers and acquisitions can
be challenging as opposing companies are often perceived as threats. Feelings of threat
create obstacles in social integration by forming a basis for “us vs. them”
categorisations. Such issues are mitigated by employees finding opposing cultures as
appealing (Junni, 2012), which is consequently a reflection of successful social
integration (Briel, Schneider & Lowry, 2019)
Björkman Stahl and Vaara (2007) also found social integration to be negatively affected
by levels of operational integration. Social integration is more likely to succeed if the
target company is granted autonomy over its operations. It is however common for the
acquiring company to demand control over operations of the target company, imposing
their own processes and culture. Forcing organisational culture and processes can be
perceived by the target company as direct criticism to their way of conducting business.
By doing so the acquiring company limits the target company’s decision-making power
often resulting in higher resistance and a negative attitude towards the acquiring
company, potentially hindering any potential social integration (Björkman, Stahl &
Vaara, 2007).

2.2.3 Cultural Learning
According to Goulet and Schweiger (2007) organisations experience cultural learning
when comparing their own organisational culture to external cultures and are able
through deep-level learning to mitigate cultural conflicts during mergers and
18

Jutta Viskari
acquisitions. Goulet and Schweiger (2007) categorise cultural learning into three levels:
surface-level cultural learning, deep-level cultural learning and no cultural learning.
Through cultural learning employees learn how and why business is conducted. Cultural
learning is limited by embeddedness of cultural characteristics due to which, employees
may be unable to recognise, communicate and rationalise characteristics of their
organisational culture. Additionally the juxta positioning of companies can affect
employees’ willingness to communicate certain aspects of culture. Deeply embedded
cultural characteristics tend to exist in unwritten forms, making their identification even
more challenging for organisations (Goulet & Schweiger, 2007).Therefore knowledge
shared about organisational culture is often limited to surface level, when the need in
mergers and acquisitions gain a deeper understanding. Therefore companies need to go
beyond opposing attitudes and create feelings of empathy and togetherness during
mergers and acquisitions. Through feelings of empathy employees are able to relate
rationally to cultural differences and perhaps begin to understand each other and aim
towards building a shared culture (Goulet & Schweiger, 2007).

2.3 Post-acquisition and Merger Integration
Section 2.3 provides and overview of commonly faced managerial issues in postacquisition/merger integrations. First personnel related issues are evaluated, followed by
a description of management’s role in integrations. Lastly the role of communication
during integrations and general issues emerging from lack of communication are
presented in final part of this chapter.

2.3.1 Personnel Issues
It is commonly agreed in merger and acquisition literature that despite their increasing
popularity, many have delivered disappointing results (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).
With approximately 30-40% considered successful (Gupta, 2010), reasons behind
failures are often deemed to poorly managed post-merger/acquisition integrations
(Lakshman, 2011) and personnel issues emerging in process (Gupta, 2010). According
to Cartwright and Cooper (1992) failures in mergers and acquisitions were traditionally
linked to financial or strategic related reasons such as overpaying for the target
19

Jutta Viskari
company, unrealistic earning predictions, sudden changes in markets or the two
organisations being ill matched strategically. Human aspects of mergers and
acquisitions began to receive attention during the 80’s which could be regarded as one
of the most significant waves of the phenomena. Despite rising interest towards the
subject, its role within mergers and acquisitions has received little attention and research
on the subject remains scarce (Junni, 2012).
Although personnel issues are of most sensitive kind, they are often overlooked in all
phases leading up to mergers (Gupta, 2010). Companies invest substantial amounts of
resources into evaluating and planning financial and strategic aspects of mergers and
acquisitions, failing to recognise the human aspects of the process and the extent to
which they affect outcomes (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992). According to Lakshman
(2011) managers may overlook human issues due to lacking knowledge on its effects
and believing they are unmanageable, further arguing that provided information on
managing human related issues lacks models and tools for managers. Cartwright and
Cooper (1992) speculate human issues are overlooked by managers because they are
unquantifiable.
Mergers and acquisitions however trending, are usually one-time experiences for
companies and managers. Therefore companies and managers are unlikely to have the
opportunity again in their careers to use knowledge gained from mergers and managing
people during them. This knowledge would naturally be more than useful for any
organisation during mergers but also in creating models and guidelines (Cartwright &
Cooper, 1992). Impeding creation of proper management tools is also that acquisitions
and mergers are largely processed behind closed doors until their official
announcement. The decision-makers and people processing acquisitions and mergers
consist often only of upper-level management, lawyers and financial people, such as
investment bankers who have little knowledge of managing personnel, especially during
challenging circumstances such as mergers (Gupta, 2010). Cartwright and Cooper
(1992) argue that companies looking to acquire need to consider in addition to rational
elements, the affective elements of the potential merger. Rational elements are the
aforementioned financial and strategic computable aspects whereas affective aspects are
softer, emotional aspects of the deal.

20

Jutta Viskari
Mergers are one of the most life alternating experiences for employees in their careers,
the effects of which have been broadly evaluated in literature. Effects are mainly caused
by uncertainty relating to mergers and acquisitions and may vary depending on whether
a company is merging, being acquired or taken over. A hostile takeover can be
considerably more difficult for the target company compared to an amicable merger.
Nevertheless, all combinations of two companies produce a reaction in employees
(Gupta, 2010). Initial emotions experienced by employees, along with uncertainty can
be powerlessness, disbelief, anger, betrayal and shock among others. These emotions
affect employees’ professional behaviour and can lead to lower productivity and
eventually employees leaving the company (Gupta, 2010).
Nature of the merger itself and personal traits of an individual affect how strongly they
experience negative feelings during mergers and acquisitions. Personality types, selfesteem and the ability to tolerate uncertainty were among the personal traits recognised
by Cartwright and Cooper (1992) affecting employees’ reactions to mergers and
acquisitions. Professional statuses, such as length of employment relationship, and how
secure an employee felt of their status at current work and within the job market were
acknowledged as factors affecting employees’ reactions (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
Junni (2012) refers to the social identity theory in understanding individual behaviour in
mergers and acquisitions. According to the theory an individual can have multiple
identities depending on context. “Personal identity” is the most unique and true identity,
but an individual is likely to have a “social identity” determining behaviour in group
settings and an “organisational identity” emerging in work environments. When an
individual's social identity is destabilised in scenarios such as mergers and acquisitions,
individuals resort to ingroup-outgroup distinctions to protect their identities. Such
categorisations have been identified as sources of employee stress and anxiety (Junni,
2012).
There exists a distinct stigma in acquisitions where the company being acquired is
usually perceived weaker and therefore negative reactions, protective behaviour over
identities and ingroup-outgroup categorisations are more likely to surface within the
target company. However, such behaviour has been recognised within the acquiring
organisations as well (Junni, 2012). In addition to personnel resisting changes inflicted

21

Jutta Viskari
by mergers, managers need to be prepared for a higher turnover in personnel (Gupta,
2010).

2.3.2 Managerial Issues
Decision-makers’ position in mergers/acquisitions is crucial and according to
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) upper-level management needs to be involved in the
process as opposed to trusting the effects and changes to trickle down to all levels.
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) emphasise the need for upper-level management to
remain as involved as possible in post-acquisition/merger integration, supporting
middle-level managers in enforcing agreed merger/acquisition terms. Additionally
personnel issues should not be left to the concern of existing departments as their
schedules are likely to be full due to other integration issues. Cartwright and Cooper
(1992) suggest companies look into hiring and external consultant or appoint a group of
individuals to overlook the integration process. An external individual is more capable
of providing an impartial perception of the process and can therefore be more effective.
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) also note that as managers rarely have first-hand
experience of mergers/acquisitions an outside individual who is an expert in the area
can provide crucial new perspectives.
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) identified four possible approaches to integrating
changes during mergers and acquisitions: aggressive, conciliative and indoctrinative or
educative approach. A single approach is unlikely to be insufficient but a combination
of several approaches can be effective.
The aggressive approach aims to the complete and fast replacement of the acquired
organisation’s culture by paying little attention to personal issues by replacing resisting
employees or threatening to do so. The effects of the aggressive approach are
controversial and often have little success. The conciliative approach aims to rationalise
the integration to employees in order to avoid conflicts. It is a much softer approach but
can also result in employees complying to changes less. The corrosive approach aims to
implement change through invisible persuasion. It consists of convincing key
individuals or groups of individuals of the changes and involving them in the process.
By doing so, management relies on these select individuals to spread changes
22

Jutta Viskari
throughout the organisation. Issues in corrosive approach usually lie in identifying key
individuals and persuading them to the acquiring company’s side. Lastly, the
indoctrination or educational approach relies on educating employees on the culture and
processes of the acquiring company. The approach ensures comprehensive learning and
understanding but can also be perceived by employees as patronising propaganda
(Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).

2.3.3 Communication Issues
Difficulties and lack of communication are more often at the root of problems in
mergers and acquisitions. Language barriers are expected in especially cross-border
mergers and acquisitions. Issues however also occur during mergers/acquisitions within
the same nationalities, as individuals’ interpretation of explicit and implicit cannot be
predicted (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007). The beginning stages of any
merger/acquisition is an indicator of the process to come, however the importance of
initial communication about the merger/acquisition is often overlooked with many
companies making the mistake of mismanaging the critical early weeks (Gupta, 2010).
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) found in their research that employees were likely to hear
about a merger/acquisition through unofficial sources presenting an unfavourable image
of the acquiring company and integration process to come.
Cartwright and Cooper (1992) argue sufficient effort in communication should be made
from the announcement of the merger/acquisition. The Announcement needs to be
thorough, informative and honest, reaching all employees of the organisation, preparing
employees for the changes to come but in a positive manner, respective of their culture,
and acknowledging potential fears and uncertainties. According to Gupta (2010) a
carefully planned communication strategy aims to eliminate false rumours swirling
around the organisation and create a clear picture of the future. A clear picture of the
future has been found to increase the level of commitment of employees as they are able
to envision themselves within the organisation’s future plans (Gupta, 2010).
Goulet and Schweiger (2007) also emphasise the need for future plans to be
communicated reliably. Clearly stating the acquiring company’s intentions regarding
the integration eases uncertainty among employees. Goulet and Schweiger (2007)
23

Jutta Viskari
further note, since communication is vulnerable to employees’ own interpretations, it
needs to be supported by other culture integration activities as well.
Employees should be provided an outlet to communicate and receive answers to their
questions and concerns from the very beginning of the integration process. Employees
may even mourn the loss of their own culture and therefore management should
encounter sufficient time for this grieving process (Cartwright & Cooper, 1992).
According to Gupta (2010), top-level management should remain involved in
communication strategies as it brings more credibility to the message and provide
employees with an outlet to share their thoughts and concerns and. Outlets such as
group meetings provide management with an image of personnel issues during
merger/acquisition and a chance to address employees concerns and straighten
misinformation (Gupta, 2010).
Moreover, Cartwright and Cooper (1992) urge companies to communicate consistently
throughout the integration process and suggest companies assign a group of people
responsible for conducting communication. Communication should introduce the new
imposed organisational culture realistically, acknowledging areas that are likely to
change as a result of the integration. Providing employees with rationalisations of
decisions is crucial for understanding and acceptance of changes. Communication’s
goal is to mitigate potential cultural clashes and other issues as much as possible.
Employees of the acquired organisation are likely to focus more on differences and
negativity but through competent communication, employees’ attention can be turned
towards similarities and positive topics (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).

2.4 Knowledge Management in Mergers and acquisitions
In addition to gaining new capabilities, such as technologies and reaching economies of
scale, mergers and acquisitions are recognised as means of gaining new knowledge
(Junni, 2012). To understand the role of knowledge in mergers and acquisitions, one
needs to understand the concept of knowledge management and challenges relating to it.
This section therefore begins by presenting the two dominant perspectives of knowledge
management and how issues relating to sharing different types of knowledge are
24

Jutta Viskari
perceived by them. After this an overview of knowledge transfer is provided, followed
by an outline of issues affecting the process during mergers and acquisitions.

2.4.1 Defining Knowledge Management
In today’s knowledge society, knowledge can be considered an organisation’s most
important asset. Koenig (2012) defines knowledge management as: “The process of
capturing, distributing, and effectively using knowledge”. Maintaining existing
knowledge along with knowledge creation, exploitation and sharing are key processes
for organisations, providing a competitive advantage in the ever changing market
environment (Nonaka, Ryoko, Konno & Teece, 2001).
Knowledge management is generally agreed to consist of four stages: knowledge
acquisition and creation, knowledge capturing and storing, knowledge dissemination
and transfer and application. Acquiring and creating knowledge consists of increased
use of existing knowledge assets and the formation of new knowledge. Existing and
newly created knowledge needs to be identified, captured and stored for future use in a
structured and accessible way. Disseminating and transferring knowledge is the process
of sharing knowledge throughout an organisation or external parties. It is a crucial step
in knowledge management as it ensures that knowledge is used and applied by
individuals (Kongpichayanond, 2009).
Nonaka et al. (2001) argue that whilst solving problems with existing knowledge,
companies challenge existing systems and processes, creating new problems and
consequently new knowledge in solving them. Therefore companies cannot be
perceived as merely entities processing knowledge but ones constantly creating new
knowledge, dynamically conversing with its environment, causing and reacting to
changes in it (Nonaka et al., 2001).
The two dominant epistemologies in knowledge management are the objectivist and
practice-based perspectives. Difference between the two epistemologies is how they
perceive tacit and explicit knowledge and relationship between the two knowledge
types. Explicit knowledge is objective, well defined knowledge existing in written
forms easily accessible by individuals. Tacit knowledge is the opposite. Existing in
25

Jutta Viskari
individual’s consciousness, often unconsciously, tacit knowledge is challenging to
capture and transfer (Groff & Jones, 2011).

2.4.1.1 The Objectivist Perspective
The objectivist perspective, also referred to as the “epistemology of possession”
perceives knowledge as an entity possessed by individuals. The objectivist perspective
regards knowledge as something that can exist objectively, outside of humans and can
therefore be transformed into codified, explicit form and be understood by anyone.
The objectivist perspective favours explicit knowledge over tacit, placing a clear
distinction between the two.
Tacit knowledge is knowledge deeply embedded within individuals. It is highly
subjective, covering both cognitive and physical skills and is therefore hard to
communicate (Hislop, 2013). The objectivist perspective therefore perceives that only
explicit knowledge can be shared and in order to be effectively shared, tacit knowledge
must be converted into explicit form. The perspective also assumes that after becoming
explicit, knowledge can be shared directly between individuals. The conduit, or
otherwise known as transmitter/receiver model, illustrates the transferral of knowledge
between individuals. The model visualises how codified, explicit knowledge can be
transferred from a sender to a receiver without a relationship between the two. The
assumption also is that no part of explicit knowledge is lost during transferral and both
the sender and receiver are able to interpret it equivalently (Hislop, 2011).

2.4.1.2 The Practice-Based Perspective
The practice based perspective challenges assumptions of the objectivist perspective by
emphasising the tacit dimension of knowledge and its existence deeply embedded
within individuals and social contexts (Iverson & McPhee, 2002).
The practice based perspective emphasises learning and managing knowledge as
opposed to conserving it in information systems (Kongpichayanond, 2009) and is based
on the assumption that much of what individuals do, is learned through practice with
acquired knowledge becoming an inseparable part of them. The practice-based
26

Jutta Viskari
perspective perceives knowledge as an activity rather than an entity and the term
“knowing” is therefore preferred in this context (Hislop, 2013).
The practice based perspective perceives knowing as a constant, partly unconscious
process which includes the entire body, as opposed to the objectivist perspective
perceiving knowledge as more of a cognitive process only involving the brain.
The practice-based perspective also challenges the distinction between types of
knowledge claiming explicit and tacit knowledge are inseparable as all explicit
knowledge contains tacit dimensions and vice versa. The perspective challenges the
transmitter/receiver model by arguing the level to which knowledge is embedded within
individuals and subjective to external factors such as cultures, meaning that parts of
tacit knowledge are lost in the process of converting it into explicit form. Therefore
according to the perspective, knowledge can never truly be explicit making the concept
of knowledge management a much more complex issue (Hislop, 2013).
This also affects the extent to which knowledge can be managed. According to the
practice-based perspective the tacitness of knowledge means that knowledge cannot
directly be managed by organisations. Knowledge sharing is perceived as an interaction
between individuals and therefore effective knowledge sharing requires efforts towards
establishing a sharing culture within organisations and creating platforms for
individuals to freely share their knowledge (Hislop, 2013).

2.4.2 Knowledge Transfer
Gaining and creating knowledge during mergers and acquisition depends on successful
knowledge transfer. Vaara and Sarala (2010, p. 1368) define knowledge transfer as “the
benefits of the knowledge flows between the acquiring and the acquired firms”.
Junni (2012) outlines several approaches to knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be
either transferred from the acquiring company to the target company in order to improve
its performance or in an attempt to reach economies of scale through standardisation
and removing overlapping operations. In the opposite scenario the acquiring company
transfers knowledge from the target company to its own operations. Such strategies can
be implemented when the acquiring company wants to adjust its operations to mimic
the ways of the target company or in order to preserve the target company’s knowledge
27

Jutta Viskari
assets. A third option for mergers and acquisitions is to combine knowledge assets in
order to create new knowledge benefitting integrated operations. This is the most
complicated of all strategies as it requires combining operations whilst preserving
knowledge assets of each organisation (Junni, 2012).
Much like prior mentioned problems with creating cultural synergies, mergers and
acquisitions are argued by Lyytinen, Heo and Yoo (2007, p. 322) to be “plagued with
difficulties to integrate knowledge resources”. Much of the problems related to
knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions stem from the aforementioned human
and cultural issues (Junni, 2012).
Research on knowledge transfer has identified numerous factors affecting knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions such as types of knowledge, individuals’ motivation
and ability to share knowledge and the levels of social and operational integration
(Junni, 2012; Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007; Gammelgaard, Husted & Michailova,
2005). These factors will be further assessed in the following sections.

2.4.2.1 Personnel Issues and Knowledge Transfer
Gammelgaard, Husted and Michailova (2005) argue that studies evaluating challenges
in mergers and acquisitions from the human perspective have widely focused on other
issues such as cultural clashes, reactions and perceptions of individuals. Knowledge
management relies heavily on individuals and can thus be considered a human issue in
mergers and acquisitions and management in general (Kongpichayanond, 2009).
Lyytinen, Heo and Yoo (2007) further note that knowledge management studies have
mainly focused on internal knowledge management issues rather than knowledge
management beyond company borders.
Mergers/acquisitions interrupt knowledge sharing processes and can have permanent
disruptive effects on even the most developed knowledge sharing practices. Therefore
among other strategies, organisations need implement a knowledge sharing strategy for
mergers/acquisitions evaluated on both collective and individual levels (Gammelgaard,
Husted & Michailova, 2005).

28

Jutta Viskari
According to Lyytinen, Heo and Yoo (2007) companies aim to mitigate internal issues
in knowledge sharing through, cultures, processes, routines and technologies. As
mentioned, mergers and acquisitions disturb these enablers of knowledge sharing by
bringing in new knowledge. New employees’ appropriate knowledge in different ways
invalidating previously configurated knowledge management tactics. The existing
knowledge management processes are further disrupted by tight schedules. As
integrations are usually implemented under tremendous time pressures combining
organisations tend to have insufficient time resources to establish adequate knowledge
management processes to replace the old ones (Lyytinen, Heo & Yoo, 2007).
Knowledge sharing and management under normal circumstances can be problematic
for companies as motivating employees to share knowledge, capturing and codifying it
can be costly and time consuming. These challenges are heightened during postmerger/acquisition integrations (Gammelgaard;Husted;& Michailova, 2005)

2.4.2.2 Knowledge Sharing Behaviour
Disclosing tacit knowledge is often dependant on disseminative capacity (Junni, 2012)
which means an individual’s ability and willingness to share knowledge in an
understandable way (Gammelgaard, Husted & Michailova, 2005). Knowledge can be
stored unconsciously and may be unacknowledged by individuals when necessary
(Dalkir, 2011). However, individuals may also be unwilling to share knowledge for
various reasons. This behaviour is referred to in knowledge management as knowledge
hoarding behaviour. According to Gammelgaard, Husted and Michailova (2005)
knowledge hoarding behaviour is highly situational and subjective to external effects
and more likely to occur in knowledge intensive industries as knowledge workers are
commonly valued based on their level of knowledge.
Employees may hoard or choose to share knowledge, depending on how they perceive it
affecting their status. Mergers and acquisitions induce feelings of uncertainty and an
individual may resort to knowledge hoarding if they consider their position insecure. An
individual may also evaluate benefits of sharing knowledge based on potential gains and
with right incentives, perceive knowledge sharing as more beneficial to their status than
hoarding (Gammelgaard, Husted & Michailova, 2005; Lakshman, 2011).

29

Jutta Viskari
Knowledge hoarding behaviour can also be induced by fears of exploitation (Junni,
2012) and knowledge parasites. Individuals possessing crucial knowledge spent a
significant amount of time gathering it, and are therefore unlikely to simply give
knowledge to other individuals. Knowledge hoarding behaviour may also be induced by
fears of criticism and inferiority (Gammelgaard, Husted & Michailova, 2005).
Effective knowledge transfer relies in addition to the knowledge sender’s willingness to
share knowledge, in the receiving individual’s willingness and ability to accept,
comprehend and apply the gained knowledge (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007). This is
referred to as absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity is argued to have a collective
dimension, defining an organisation’s ability to receive and assimilate knowledge from
external sources (Junni, 2012). Absorptive capacity consists of both the receiver’s
motivation and ability to receive and integrate knowledge (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara,
2007) and is generally agreed by scholars to form of three stages: knowledge
recognition, assimilation and exploitation (Briel, Schneider & Lowry, 2019)
Organisational culture has a direct effect on absorptive capacity as cultural differences
may affect both employees’ ability and willingness to identify and apply useful
knowledge from the opposing company. According to Björkman, Stahl and Vaara
(2007) the more different two organisational cultures are, the less likely it is employees
are open to receiving knowledge from the opposing company.
Absorptive capacity is attributed by Gammelgaard, Husted and Michailova (2005) to
knowledge-rejecting behaviour. At the root of the knowledge rejecting problem is the
“not invented here syndrome” defined as: “the tendency of a project group of stable
composition to believe it possesses a monopoly of knowledge of its field” (Nobuo &
Nobuyuki, 2012, p. 3) leading to individuals or groups of individuals to reject
knowledge from external sources. Knowledge rejecting behaviour can occur both in the
acquiring and target company, at its worst leading to disruptive behaviour such as
sabotaging and refusal to utilise offered knowledge. According to Gammelgaard,
Husted and Michailova (2005), knowledge rejecting behaviour can be induced by
mistrust in offered knowledge but also professional pride of individuals. Individuals
prefer creating their own knowledge especially if they are unqualified to properly
evaluate the quality of external knowledge. Employees of the acquired organisation are
prone to value their own culture even more during mergers/acquisitions and due to this
30

Jutta Viskari
be less accepting of external cultures and all aspects of it (Gammelgaard Husted &
Michailova, 2005).

2.4.2.3 Social Integration and Knowledge Transfer
How combining companies perceive and value each other’s knowledge assets and both
parties’ motivation to share knowledge affects knowledge transfer in mergers and
acquisitions (Junni, 2012). Social identification theory emphasises the need for shared
social identity and its effects on knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions (Junni,
2012). Lack of shared identity has been identified as source of personnel problems
emerging in mergers and acquisitions, consisting of negative attitudes towards the
merger/acquisition, ingroup-outgroup categorisations and increased rates of employee
turnover. These issues according to the social identification theory hinder effective
knowledge transfer (Junni, 2012).
Björkman, Stahl, and Vaara (2007) attribute social integration to collective and
individual absorptive capacity. As explained in chapter 2.2.2, social integration is the
process of creating combined social norms. Successful social integration creates trust
among employees and contributes to shared values and goals. Successful social
integration creates networks and communication between units and is thus likely to
improve employees’ capabilities in finding, transferring and absorbing knowledge
beyond company borders (Björkman, Stahl, and Vaara, 2007).
Briel, Schneider and Lowry (2019, p. 17) refer to social integration in the context of
knowledge absorption as “the extent to which members of a group participate and
collaborate in knowledge recognition, assimilation and exploitation”. Briel, Schneider
and Lowry (2019) argue that mechanisms fostering environmental, affective, cognitive
and behavioural social integration contribute positively to knowledge absorption.
Environmental, affective, cognitive and environmental social integration are further
explained in chapter 2.2.2.
Mechanisms fostering environmental social integration offer necessary resources for
employees to socially interact during integrations. Mechanisms can be temporal,
31

Jutta Viskari
offering sufficient time for interaction, or spatial enabling face-to-face or virtual
interaction between individuals supporting knowledge absorption. Environmental social
integration enables knowledge recognition, assimilation and exploitation by offering a
shared space for individuals to seek knowledge and interact with one another.
Mechanisms fostering affective social integration support knowledge absorption by
creating positive perceptions motivating employees to collaborate effectively in sharing
and applying knowledge. Mechanisms such as social gatherings increase understanding
among individuals directly affecting their ability to recognise knowledge. Positive
emotions towards the opposing company further increase employees’ willingness to
exploit knowledge consequently increasing the ability to also assimilate knowledge.
Mechanisms, such as training, fostering cognitive social integration create a shared
context between employees supporting knowledge absorption. Shared context allows
employees to understand how and why knowledge is applied, enabling knowledge
assimilation and exploitation. Cognitive social integration is essential in combining
knowledge but less crucial for knowledge recognition, as employees are likely to be
able to identify crucial knowledge even without deeper understanding of its origins.
Mechanisms fostering behavioural social integration create common goals and support
co-operation making them crucial for knowledge exploitation. Behavioural social
integration is less essential to knowledge recognition and assimilation as these stages of
knowledge absorption require less coordinated actions (Briel, Schneider & Lowry,
2019).
Briel, Schneider and Lowry (2019) further argue that mechanisms of social integration
moderate the effects of knowledge characteristics on knowledge absorption.
Characteristics affecting knowledge absorption are knowledge distance, tacitness and
complexity. Knowledge distance refers to the extent of differences between an
organisation’s existing knowledge and external knowledge. This gap is reduced by
cognitive social integration as it offers common ground for employees increasing their
understanding of knolwedge. Absorbing tacit knowledge is particularly crucial for
process innovation where organisations apply new knowledge directly into existing
processes. Mechanisms fostering environmental and cognitive social integration are
recognised by Briel, Schneider and Lowry (2019) as enablers of absorbing tacit
knowledge. Due to the contextual dimension of tacit knowledge, it can only be shared
through interaction, offered by environmental social integration. Additionally, sharing
32

Jutta Viskari
tacit knowledge requires common ground offered by cognitive social integration (Briel,
Schneider & Lowry, 2019).
Knowledge complexity refers to the number of individual components contributing to a
knowledge entity. Due to the number of components, knowledge is often scattered
between individuals and departments, making it near impossible for a single individual
to comprehend the totality of all components. Complex knowledge is particularly
difficult to absorb as it requires understanding the relatedness of components and the
ability to apply this understanding into new processes. Briel, Schneider and Lowry
(2019) found mechanisms fostering behavioural and cognitive social integration as
enablers of absorbing complex knowledge. Absorbing complex knowledge requires
strong cooperation offered by behavioural social integration. Cognitive social
integration creates a common ground supporting understanding between employees and
closing knowledge gaps thus supporting exploitation of complex knowledge (Briel,
Schneider & Lowry, 2019).

2.4.2.4 Operational Integration and Knowledge Transfer
Along with social integration, the level of operational integration has been identified to
affect knowledge transfer (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007). Research indicates that
levels of operational integration depend on whether merging companies operate within
similar fields. If two organisation’s share common ground the acquiring organisation is
less likely to choose high levels of operational integration. According to Junni’s (2012)
research, shared common ground indicates improved absorptive capacity requiring less
invasive operational integration as combining companies are able share knowledge
effectively through other means.
Allowing autonomy for the target company can support knowledge transfer as the
approach is likely to support employee motivation and mitigate employee turnover.
Employees are likely to remain more satisfied and have a more amicable perception of
the acquiring company if little operational changes are inflicted due to the
merger/acquisition. According to Junni (2012) research also suggests allowing
autonomy supports knowledge creation in the target company, whereas high levels of
33

Jutta Viskari
operational integration may have negative effects on innovation. However, findings
have also shown that by allowing autonomy, knowledge transfer is likely to remain
scarce as the combining organisations establish little interaction between one another
(Junni, 2012).

2.4.2.5 Organisational Culture and Knowledge Transfer
Much of the human related knowledge transfer issues surfacing in mergers and
acquisitions are attributed to organisational culture. Vast differences in organisational
cultures can induce ingroup-outgroup categorisations which are further believed to
result in lack of trust between joining companies. Establishing trust is crucial for
knowledge transfer as it affects individuals’ knowledge sharing behaviour and cultural
differences can therefore be argued to affect knowledge transfer through to dissimilative
and absorptive capacities. Research however also indicates cultural differences may
have positive effects on knowledge transfer if cultural features have contributed to
complimentary knowledge assets (Björkman, Stahl & Vaara, 2007).
Vaara and Sarala (2010) evaluated the effects of organisational culture and cultural
integration on knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions by including the variable
of social and operational integration. Vaara and Sarala (2010) categorise cultural
learning into cultural convergence and crossvergence and found cultural integration to
have positive effects on knowledge transfer regardless of differences in organisational
cultures.
Vaara and Sarala (2019) define cultural convergence as integration in which one
culture, usually the one of the acquiring companies is preserved and cultural traits of the
target organisation are diminished in order for the two cultures to become more similar.
Cultural crossvergence is cultural integration in which cultures are equally combined to
create a new, unique organisational culture consisting of cultural traits from both
parties. Cultural convergence is more likely to support knowledge transfer when
knowledge is transported from the acquiring to the target organisation, whereas cultural
crossvergence is likely to have a positive impact on knowledge transfer when

34

Jutta Viskari
knowledge is transferred from the target organisation to the acquiring organisation
(Junni, 2012).
Junni (2010) found both cultural convergence and crossvergence depend highly on
managerial efforts to cultural learning initiatives. Cultural learning in mergers and
acquisitions aims towards a deep understanding on core cultural characteristics of
combining organisations. Cultural learning is according to Junni (2012) initiated by
management and crucial for knowledge transfer as it supports knowledge disseminative
and absorptive capabilities by improving understanding between combining
organisations. Junni (2010) further argues that cultural learning initiatives are especially
crucial when knowledge is transferred from the target organisation to the acquiring
organisation.

3 Methods
This section presents the chosen study method and how the study was conducted. An
overview and justification of study method is provided followed by a description of data
collection process, selected sample size and an overview of how study results were
analysed. This section also presents the two case companies involved within the postacquisition process on which this study is based upon, and a description and
justification of the interviewees selected to this study.

3.1 Study method
The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate how social integration contributes to knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions and the role of management in shaping a culture
supporting knowledge transfer. The chosen study method to this study was in-depth
interviews, a form of qualitative study method (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). The study
method was chosen based on the overall objective of the thesis. Organisational culture
tends to be highly embedded within employees who may be unable to identify and thus
communicate aspects of it. Social integration is reflected in employees’ personal
experiences and perceptions of the opposing company. Similarly, management’s role
and necessity are subjective to employees’ perceptions as some may perceive it as more
crucial to integration processes than others. In-depth interviews are an effective research
method when the purpose is to gain in-depth insight on interviewees’ personal
experiences and perceptions (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003) and therefore suitable for this
research.

3.2 Data collection
The role of interviewer in in-depth interviews is to facilitate an environment where
interviewees feel free to express their opinions, feelings and experiences but also to
participate actively in conversation (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). Interviews were conducted
individually with each employee to allow free speech and establish an environment of
trust. Two interviews were conducted face-to-face in the interviewees’ place of work
and two through virtual platforms. Time preserved for each interview was one hour,
36

Jutta Viskari
which was sufficient since all interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes. Interviewees
were informed about the general theme of the study, but detailed descriptions were not
given to avoid prejudices and support open conversation.
In-depth interviews are often performed using broad, open-ended questions contrasted
with simple yes or no questions. Open-ended questions leave room for conversation and
exploring topics deeply, whereas yes or no questions serve mainly as an affirmation to
answers (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). The interviews consisted mainly of open conversation
with, few open-ended, pre-determined questions guiding and supporting conversation.
Questions were based on themes of the study. The interviews were recorded for the
purposes of the analysis but transcriptions were not added to this thesis, due to the
sensitivity of the topic and to preserve anonymity of interviewees’ and companies
involved. Direct quotes from the interviews are included within the thesis to support
reliability of the analysis.

3.3 Case companies
This section presents the two companies involved within the post-acquisition integration
process. Due to anonymity reasons, the acquired company will be henceforth referred to
as company A and the acquiring as company B. Both companies’ operations are
described in detail to support understanding of the analysis and findings of this study.
Company descriptions are based on company documents provided by a representative of
company B’s human resource department.
Company A
Although the combining companies operated within the same field, company A’s core
operations were relatively unfamiliar to company B. Company A’s operations were
largely determined by the needs of public customers requiring a pre-determined number
of professionals agreed to in contracts. Therefore, the majority of company A’s
employees in addition to professionals offering services worked in staffing duties,
locating, contacting and employing professionals to fulfil the needs of public customers.
This department will henceforth be referred as staffing.
37

Jutta Viskari
Company A’s professionals worked mainly in units owned by public customers whereas
company B mainly employed professionals within their own units, offering services to
their own private customers. As company B did not have an outside entity determining
amounts of professionals needed to be employed per unit, the company did not have a
similar staffing department as company A.
As previously stated staffing employees’ core task was hiring professionals for public
customers but tasks also included managing existing professionals. The professionals’
employment relationships were formed with company A, not the customers, which
meant staffing employees were responsible for employment processes and contractual
terms. Professionals worked for multiple customers performing shifts in varying units at
varying times with the staffing employee being responsible for their schedules. Majority
of the contracts with public customers included a pre-determined amount of
professionals per shift that company A had guaranteed to deliver. The amounts were
more often contractually tied to sanctions that were imposed by customers if the
company failed to deliver agreed amounts of professionals.
The day-to-day operations of staffing could therefore be described as rather hectic since
employees potentially managed multiple customers and professionals, whilst constantly
hiring new professionals to ensure that customer requirements were met under the threat
of sanctions. The number of existing professionals and new hires were high in
comparison to the number of employees working in staffing, meaning that one
employee was likely to have a lot on their plate.
The types of professionals employed both by company A and B were in a favourable
position within the job-market, the need for them surpassing their amount. Having
substantially high job security, professionals were not dependant on companies such as
A and B but rather companies and the public sector were dependent on them. This
meant that professionals had the upper hand in negotiating employment terms.
Company A, being bound by contracts to deliver professionals to customers, was
therefore a rather flexible negotiator in terms of employment contracts, agreeing to
various terms in order to ensure a hire.

38

Jutta Viskari
Staffing employees worked in regional offices serving customers and professionals
within their respective regions. Amounts and types of customers, as well as the amounts
of professionals varied between different regions. Most regional offices would also have
sub-departments delivering customers with services of professionals with different areas
of expertise. The respective market situation affected how business was conducted in
each regional office. Policies often differed between sub-departments operating within
regional offices and therefore employment terms and processes varied substantially
within company A.
Each professional needed to be processed into the payroll and human resource system
by the payroll department based on employment contracts delivered to them by staffing
employees. As mentioned, employment terms varied and some variations could not be
processed within the limitations of the system. In such cases, variations would be
processed manually by the payroll.
Company B
As previously stated company B had different operations compared to company A’s.
Company B had few public customers, but professionals employed by these customers
were mainly employed full-time, meaning that their status with public customers were
more or less stabilised.
Professionals were mainly employed to certain units and managed by the managers of
each unit. Unit managers handled employment contracts and relationships, but
contractual terms and all aspects of employment relationships were closely monitored
by regional managers and the human resource department. Although units could be
large, a unit manager in company B had fewer employees to manage than an individual
staffing employee of company A.
Company B utilised the same payroll and human resource system as company A, but in
a very different manner. Company B employed approximately three times the number
of employees than company A and therefore employment terms and processes were
highly standardised. Standardisations were based strongly on labour agreements and
legislation, which company B was known to follow to a tee.
39

Jutta Viskari
Professionals were processed into the payroll and human resource system by unit
managers but before forming a contract, each employment relationship and its terms
were overlooked by the human resource department. The department intervened to each
contract if it had any deviations to standardised company terms and policies. After
human resources, each contract was overlooked by a unit manager’s supervisor and
payroll, which both also intervened if any deviations were spotted. This meant that
employment relationships and their terms were checked by three separate entities,
before contracts could be made with professionals. Although each employment
relationship needed to pass three evaluations, the process was relatively quick due to the
highly standardised terms and policies resulting, in only a number of employment
models.
Having a clear picture of employment models and what each employment relationship
could entail, made verifying them more or less a routine process for all departments
responsible. The system of company B was developed in a manner which made the
process as automated as possible, requiring little manual work. The process also ensured
each employment relationship followed the terms and policies of company B.
Due to the high number of employees processed by human resources and payroll on a
daily basis, the general mentality within these departments was to do as little work as
possible for the managers in order to maintain responsibility of managing employees as
the tasks of managers. This mentality supported the task division within company B,
with human resources and payroll advising and assisting managers in using systems and
managers managing their own employees.
Most of the responsibility in overlooking contracts was placed on company B’s human
resource department. The human resource department in addition to overlooking each
employment contract advised middle-level managers, such as unit and regional
managers, in matters relating to employment relationships and in using the payroll and
human resource system. The department was also responsible for developing and
introducing new employment terms and policies and integrating newly acquired
companies into the human resource and payroll system.

40

Jutta Viskari
3.4 Selected Interviewees
The conscious decision was made to limit the focus of this restudy to company B’s
human resource department as the integration mainly focused on this department’s
operations. The company A’s operations were focused on hiring employees, making the
combined organisations rich in personnel and placing human resources at the centre of
operations.
Interviews were conducted with four employees from company B’s human resource
department. The purpose of these interviews was to gain an understanding of how the
acquisition actualised within the human resources department and how it affected the
employees involved closely and remotely to the process. The human resource
department of company B is rather small and therefore the number of interviewees was
chosen in correlation to the number of employees working in the department.
Interviewees were chosen from various levels of the department, performing different
tasks during the post-acquisition integration in order to receive a comprehensive image
of the process and its effects on the department. In order to preserve anonymity of
interviewees, specific information other than the longitude of employment relationships
and a description of interviewees’ tasks within the integration process will not be
disclosed. Interviewees will be henceforth referred to as employee 1, 2 and 3 and 4.

4 Analysis and interpretation of results
Section four first provides a brief description of the post-acquisition integration process
of company A and B and general tasks of the human resource department of company B
during integrations. Both descriptions are based on company documents provided by a
representative of company B’s human resource department.
Secondly this section provides an analysis and interpretation of the results of the
interviews. To understand managements’ role in creating a culture supporting
knowledge transfer, and the contribution of social integration to knowledge transfer, the
interviewees’ perceptions of both cultures had first to be assessed. By doing so, this
thesis aimed to evaluate if connections could be made with employees’ perceptions of
cultures and levels of social integration and how these factors affected knowledge
transfer. Lastly the aim was to evaluate the management’s role and how it affected
knowledge transfer during the post-acquisition integration.

4.1 Post-acquisition integration process
Company B acquired new companies regularly and the human resource department
therefore had a relatively routine process to integrating new employees into their
systems. Acquisitions were unlikely to demand adjusting existing processes and
policies, but if necessary, managers re-negotiated employment terms to fit company B’s
processes and policies. This ensured that the human resource department had to simply
integrate employees into the human resource and payroll system. The human resource
department was also responsible for training new employees and managers to using the
human resource and payroll system. Company B had made some larger acquisitions
within the past ten years prior to acquiring company A, but company A was by far the
largest acquisition.
The planned duration of the post-acquisition integration of company A and B was one
year. The integration was divided into two parts, a smaller integration being
implemented during spring over the course of five months, and the second larger
integration, on which this thesis is focused on, during the rest of the year. Since the two
companies had little overlapping operations, company B wanted to preserve company
42

Jutta Viskari
A’s operations as they were, with as little interference as possible. The decision was
however made to integrate all human resource and payroll processes and systems, the
integration therefore concerning mainly company B’s human resource department. All
company A’s employees needed to be transferred into company B’s human resource
and payroll systems and since company B wanted company A’s business to remain
more or less intact, the integration did not entail renegotiating employment terms.
Therefore, before transferring employees from company A’s systems to company B’s
systems, the human resource department needed to identify all company A’s
employment models and adjust systems and existing processes accordingly to support
them.

4.2 Organisational Culture
Interviewees’ perceptions of company A seemed to vary not only depending on their
position but also involvement in the integration process. Employees 1 and 2 were
involved mostly in integrating company A’s employees into the human resource and
payroll system, whereas employees 3 and 4 performed other tasks relating to the
integration. Employees 1 and 2 had also been employed by company B for a longer
duration than employees 3 and 4. Interviewees involved in the systems integration,
expressed more frustration towards the differences between organisational cultures. A
correlation could also be made with the longitude of employment relationship.
Interviewees who had been employed by company B for a longer time had a somewhat
more critical perception of company A’s culture and how business was conducted.
Additionally, these interviewees expressed less criticism towards their own culture and
operations. The biggest source of frustration seemed to be the lack of processes in
human resources and the amount of employment models. For instance, two of the
interviewees mentioned that:
“No one in company A seemed to think too much why things were done the way they
were. Everything was taken as is, whereas here we actually think about what we are
doing, why and how. We know how to make processes and hold on to them. Company A
did not have any HR-processes, everyone did what they wanted”. (Employee 1)
“Personally, what was the most difficult to me was that everything was so unclear. I
like to be organised and then everything was a mess”. (Employee 2)
43

Jutta Viskari

“What has been the hardest for me are the 10,000 exceptions (in the employment
models). The palette was very clear before the acquisition and I don’t have
understanding towards the deviations. I mean, I sort of like how they have made us
question our methods but still I’m baffled by how this big of a mass can do everything
differently, like so-so”. (Employee 1)
The role and process orientation of company A was acknowledged by all interviewees,
but interviewees more involved in the systems integration, employed by company B for
a longer duration, seemed to favour the process approach. Interviewees who were less
involved in the systems integration had consequently been employed for company B for
a shorter period. These interviewees did favour company B’s culture but also identified
limitations to it. These interviewees were able to critically evaluate both cultures as they
also described company A’s culture and its origins rather clearly, identifying pros and
cons to it as well by stating that:
“It is clear as skies that we have processes, lines between which we operate. Company
A does have certain things in books, but not necessarily for the purpose of following
them. This perhaps reflects on that everything is allowed as long as results are reached
and that the company remains agile and flexible. This brings a certain advantage but
also results in overlapping tasks, mixed responsibilities and roles”. (Employee 3)
“We have rather clear roles and an organisational structure, but our systems structure
is not always the most flexible and agile and that brings certain challenges”. (Employee
3)
“Company B is much more process driven and the owners of processes hold a much
tighter grip on their own processes than in company A. To a certain extent company A
is much freer and you perhaps get the impression that no one cares how thigs are done
as long as certain results are reached. The methods behind results are not as essential
as the results whereas in company B we hold quite tightly to agreed methods. Well, not
quite tightly, really tightly”. (Employee 4)

4.3 Social integration
Once the interviewees’ perception of both cultures, and their ability to critically
evaluate them was assessed, the contribution of social integration could be assessed.
Interviewees managing systems integration stated no efforts in social integration during
the post-acquisition period whereas employee 3 disclosed learning opportunities and
employee 4 had become familiarised with company A through other means. Employee 3
44

Jutta Viskari
and 4 therefore, had a clear picture and understanding of company A’s operations, as
they stated that:
“August and September were spent on trying to understand the business. It started to
unravel during October once we knew what changes the business would require. I felt
like to business was quite easy to understand. I mean it was quite the process but once it
was explained for the third and fourth time it became clearer and I felt like by the end of
September I was caught up with everything”. (Employee 3)
On the opposite end, employee 1 involved in the systems integration stated to have no
picture nor understanding of what the business consisted of, indicating familiarisation
efforts had been scarce or non-existent. Employee 1 and 2’s answers indicated that lack
of knowledge on company A’s operations resulted in a lack of understanding increasing
their frustration towards differences. Employees 1 and 2 being less socially integrated
criticised how processes were managed in company A and justified their own culture,
by saying:
“It showed that we have a small management whereas they had ten people managing
only one person. They had become used to someone doing the work for them but here a)
dot it yourself and b) you only have one person you can contact (in HR matters) and not
10 people managing 10 different things”. (Employee 1)
“I had to wonder how they had managed it all. People did things without understanding
what they were connected to, why and how”. (Employee 2)
Least socially integrated and involved in the integration, employee 1 was sceptical and
less motivated towards combining processes and felt frustrated that processes were
combined the way they were, stating:
“We manage masses and you perhaps remember the exceptions of a small group, but
you can’t remember the exceptions of your group and then your colleagues group. I
understand that you can’t do this according to systems but when you manage masses
you have to do so. You simply cannot manage masses with 10,000 exceptions to the
processes. I think they realised this too late into the process” (Employee 1)
Employee 3 and 4 with the most learning opportunities were more motivated towards
creating a combined culture and operations were more optimistic of the outcome of the
process and expressed little feelings of frustration towards it, they indicated that:

45

Jutta Viskari
“I myself did feel like everyone truly had a genuine will to take best practices from each
company and combine them” (Employee 3)
“I don’t think that the integration process could have been done otherwise, I felt like it
was the best choice” (Employee 4)
Level of understanding brought by social integration could therefore be determined to
affect employees’ motivation and attitude towards the integration. What could also be
determined was that social integration increased interviewees’ ability to critically
evaluate both companies’ cultures and resulted in a more amicable perception of the
opposing company. Once interviewees’ perceptions of cultures and levels of social
integration were determined, their effects on knowledge transfer could be assessed.

4.4 The Effects of Social integration on Knowledge Transfer
Employees 1 and 2 were most dependent on knowledge transfer as they were involved
in the systems integration, which was the focus point of the entire integration process.
As prior identified, employees 1 and 2 had received less learning opportunities and were
therefore less socially integrated. Both employees 1 and 2 described issues in locating
the right people with the right knowledge in company A. According to employees 1 and
2, locating knowledge was challenging since company A lacked clear roles, with several
people managing several smaller entities, mentioning that:
“You needed to know who to contact for information or else things would go wrong.
Everyone’s matters were managed by a different person and no one knew who was
managing whose matters”. (Employee 1)
“It was so challenging to even find the smallest group of people who knew something.
No one knew which employees were being transferred, where they should be transferred
and why. Even internally they didn’t know who knew something, it was all so unclear,
and no one had answers for anything”. (Employee 2)
In addition to difficulties in locating people with the right knowledge, interviewees
struggled with the lack of processes in company A and amount of employment models,
describing that:
“It was so weird to me that let’s say these five people manage these 100 professionals
but then all five do things however they want to” (Employee 1)
46

Jutta Viskari

“It was a big source of confusion for me that there wasn’t a single person you could ask
about the employment models. No matter how many fragments there are you would
think there would be someone managing them and on top of them” (Employee 1)
In addition to locating individuals with knowledge, interviewees had challenges in
grasping knowledge entities. Interviewees expressed frustration towards how employees
in company A were unable to communicate how processes were built and why. These
issues were especially described by employees 1 and 2 in charge of systems integration
and needing to integrate processes into company B’s systems, they mentioned that:
“She knew what she had manually input something in the systems but had no idea on
where the thing she had input came from. No one knew how to explain entities everyone
only understood their own small portion of the process. If they had done something they
did not know what is was connected to. Employees had come and gone and therefore
nobody understood how systems worked and therefore did a lot of manual work”.
(Employee 2)
“It felt like a number appeared from somewhere and someone moved that number
somewhere but they had no idea what that number consisted of”. (Employee 1)
Employees also disclosed having difficulties in understanding knowledge provided by
company A and information being processed differently to company B’s systems,
mentioning that:
“They speak a completely different language. A certain group of employees within the
system could entail employees from any other groups. Nothing is what is seems. It was
all a big mess and they merely found it amusing. It would have been much easier to be
the sending party than the receiving in this case”. (Employee 2)
Employee 4, also partially involved in the systems integration, identified similar issues
in interpreting knowledge as employee 1 and 2. However, being more socially
integrated, employee 4 had a different outtake on the matter. Employee 4 was able to
critically evaluate circumstances perceiving fault in both parties, stating that:
“The problems began when two completely different companies spoke in different
languages. Company B did not understand what company A was doing and company A
did not understand what company B was asking of them. Company B just did not
understand that you could do things differently and it constantly came as a surprise to
them. I think this problem applied to company A as well, when you have done things a

47

Jutta Viskari
certain way for a long time you just don’t grasp that things can be done differently”.
(Employee 4)

4.5 The Role of Management
This thesis also aimed to understand how management contributes to a culture
supporting knowledge transfer in acquisitions. All interviewees expressed criticism
towards upper level managements’ contribution to the integration. Interviewees were
uninvolved in the early stages of the integration process. This indicated that
management perhaps unacknowledged the effects of human resource issues on the
integration process as one of the interviewees mentioned that:
“I was whisked without warning to an ongoing meeting. I think the purpose of the
meeting was to figure out company A’s operational culture from the perspective of HR,
but no one from HR was in the meeting apart from me when I was summoned. I don’t
think they realised that the people participating in that meeting were not capable of
explaining these things as they perhaps would have wanted”. (Employee 4)
Interviewees also described how they were appointed to the integration once it had
already commenced, further indicating that human resources were unacknowledged
during early stages, as it was indicated by one of the interviewees:
“By the time the integration was appointed to me it was a train that had already left the
station and I merely jumped aboard”. (Employee 3)
Initial predictions and statements given by management during the pre-acquisition
phase indicated they had little understanding on how different the organisational
cultures of the two companies were. Predictions according to interviewees affected
preparedness towards the integration, by stating:
“I don’t think they recognised the problem (cultural differences) well or at all.
Company B seemed to take it for granted that we do things this way so surely you do
too. At least in the beginning they seemed to have the attitude that yeah we will manage
this easily. I think it came as a surprise to them. I mean I’m not a 100% sure but I think
it did”. (Employee 4)
“Oh, they said that the systems integration will be so easy since company A was using
the same system. They said that company A’s version of the system was so good. Well it
wasn’t”. (Employee 1)

48

Jutta Viskari
Employees 1 and 2 having been involved in previous integrations had a negative
perception of the process in general, indicating that previous integrations had been
challenging as well. Employees 1 and 2 also stated that management had become rather
distant from integration processes from the perspective of human resources, and lacked
understanding on the amount of work they inflicted on human resources. Employees 1
and 2 mentioned that:
“An acquisition is never nice new just because of the sheer amount of work. I feel like
do they even appreciate the amount of work we put into them? I don’t think I’ve ever
received much gratitude”. (Employee 2)
“There is not a single integration that HR hasn’t successfully managed everyone has
always received their salaries more or less correctly and in time. I think that because
we have never failed, management does not realise how difficult integrations are on our
department and therefore don’t think we need any help or extra resources”. (Employee
1)
Resourcing was a significant issue identified by all interviewees during the integration.
Like employee 1 had stated, resources had more or less always been tight during
integrations, but according to answers especially so in this case. The integration of
company A was the largest integration of company B’s history and heavy on human
resources due to the type of business both companies were involved in. Most
interviewees described challenges in managing the integration along with other day-today tasks. Human resources had requested the help of a project manager, but one was
not appointed to the integration. This was mentioned by three interviewees:
“Yeah, we’ve been manging this on our own. We asked for a project manager to help
human resources, but we didn’t get one. I felt like there were so many issues that were
left for me to resolve, issues that I usually didn’t have to worry about during
integrations. This case was so foggy. How can it be that once there is an acquisition
involving 3000 people, all of a sudden, we have to do everything on our own? This was
just so poorly organised all in all”. (Employee 2)
”It is a big problem that acquisitions are placed on top of your work. The bigger the
acquisition the more impossible the situation gets. Sure, you can manage a 30 person
acquisition on the side but an acquisition of 3000 people is a completely different
story”. (Employee 1)
“I was in charge of three other entities along with the integration and I did everything
else on the side. No one reacted to the resourcing problem, nothing was done to it. This
was the biggest and most complicated integration and we did it with the smallest
resources”. (Employee 3)
49

Jutta Viskari

The statements of interviewees supported employee 1 and 2’s speculation on that
management lacked understanding on how integrations affected human resources. Two
interviewees described how lack of resources resulted in a lack of focus in the
integration consequently affecting the quality of the process:
“We lived hand-to-mouth in terms of the integration. We simply did not have time to
make fancy plans. I did not have time to update the project plan for HR or organise
entities. I was just shooting here and there. It would have been easier if I would have
been able to focus.” (Employee 3)
“I would have taken more resources immediately in the early autumn. Many things
would have become easier, if we could have focused”. (Employee 3)
“It all fell on one person. It is the worst when you are in the midst of the rush and you
would need to familiarise people for three weeks before they get a grasp of it”.
(Employee 1)
“I mean it would have been great if someone else in addition to me could have done the
tasks I was doing”. (Employee 4)
Employees 3 and 4 also recognised how the rush created by lack of resources affected
social integration. Although these employees were more socially integrated than others,
they recognised how time limitations limited opportunities to become familiarised with
company A. Although the initial purpose was to perhaps combine cultures and
operations equally, human resources had insufficient time to understand and compare
best practices of both companies. This was described by two interviewees:
“I must admit that we haven’t really had the time to look at everything and think where
we could learn.” (Employee 2)
“At that point when you are in the middle of that insane rush and you have immense
amounts of work to do it is impossible to fit very deep learning on the other company to
that”. (Employee 2)
Therefore, the lack of resourcing could be determined to affect knowledge transfer
through lack of social integration. In addition to the general rush under resourcing also
affected communications. For unknown reasons management did not engage
communications department to the integration, leaving responsibility of
communications to employee 4. According to employee 4, the lack of support from
50

Jutta Viskari
communication reflected on the integration, increasing change resistance in company A
and creating further challenged for human resources, as it was indicated that:
“They were saying that we hadn’t communicated changes or provided training but we
have been communicating and offering training constantly, every week. We have had to
do this integration without the support of communications although the department has
been closely engaged in previous integrations. I was the one doing the HR
communication without their support, on the side. I feel like it effected the integration.
In previous integrations things have been communicated in a nicer package”.
(Employee 3)
Communication reflected poorly to other interviewees who agreed that communication
is a crucial part of the integration process and felt it was ill-managed.
In addition to communication from company B to A, internal communication was
lacking. Employee 1, being the least involved in the integration, but still partaking in
the systems integration, was critical towards what was integrated and how, indicating
that the purpose of the integration and generally agreed terms of the acquisition were
miscommunicated throughout the department. Employee 1 stated:
“It’s useless for the acquired company to fight back during acquisitions but for some
reason all employment models were allowed to pass through. They were for some
reason or maybe on purpose allowed do what they wanted but you cannot combine two
companies so that one half follows processes and the other half doesn’t. I think they
realised this a bit too late. It would have been easier for me to process this if someone
would have offered me an explanation on why this was happening”. (Employee 1)
The lack of internal communication affected employee 1’s motivation towards the
integration and creating a combined culture and operations. What could also be
concluded that this affected their willingness to accept and apply knowledge transferred
from company A.

5 Discussion
This chapter discusses findings of the thesis. First connections to literature review are
discussed followed by answers to the research questions. Findings in connections to
literature review are discussed through themes relevant to the thesis. First, findings on
organisational culture types, personnel issues emerging during the post-acquisition
integration and the connection in findings between organisational culture and social
integration are discussed. Lastly findings on the managements role and knowledge
transfer in relation to literature review are assessed.

5.1 Organisational Culture Types
Based on the analysis of the interviews, one can conclude that company B and A had
rather different organisational cultures. Although the two companies operated in the
same field, their core businesses differed, partially contributing to differences in
organisational cultures as well. What could be determined based on the findings is that
company A’s organisational culture was especially shaped by the industry the company
was operating in. Business was driven by very specific needs of external clients,
resulting in a more pressured business environment. Certain results needed to be
achieved with the threat of sanctions. Arguably this had shaped organisational culture
towards a more result driven rather than a process driven direction.
Findings on organisational cultures supported Cartwright and Cooper’s (1992)
categorisation of organisational culture types. All interviewees’ descriptions of
company A’s culture fit the characteristic of task cultures. According to Cartwright and
Cooper (1992) employees in task cultures are result driven and committed to
completing tasks with less concern placed on how they are completed. This was
identified by all interviewees as the key characteristic of company A.
Nearly all pros and cons in company A’s operations identified by interviewees were
identical to Cartwright and Cooper’s (1992) descriptions, agreeing that company A’s
culture enabled creativity and a level of flexibility but also led to lack of standardised
processes resulting in a number of sub-cultures and different ways of conducting
business between internal departments. What could be drawn from the findings is that
these cultural characteristics contributed to the multiple different employment models
52

Jutta Viskari
and lack of cohesiveness between them and in no one in company A having an allencompassing image of all employment models.
Task cultures are by Cartwright and Cooper’s (1992) definition difficult to manage in
challenging situations. This was evident in findings as nearly all interviewees stated as
main source of challenges during the integration being the amount of employment
models and no one in company A’s management having comprehensive image of them.
Due to the dominant culture, company A’s operations were scattered and rather difficult
to manage in terms of process creation and systemisation.
Interviewees described company B’s operations as being built on strict processes,
standards and rules, supported by clearly defined roles. These characteristics are
identified by Cartwright and Cooper (1992) as characteristics of role cultures. Role
cultures offer a certain level of security and clarity, but have the tendency to be
bureaucratic and slow in decision-making processes. As opposed to task cultures, role
cultures are more concerned with the process in completing tasks than the results. In this
sense, role and task cultures are polar opposites and differences in valuing processes can
based on the findings be regarded as one of the main sources of problems in during the
integration.
Interviewees described how they were faced with the unfamiliar problem of being
unable to locate key employees and their roles in company A during the integration.
Role cultures according to Cartwright and Cooper’s (1992) description rely heavily on
roles and tend to have strict hierarchies, traits which could be identified in interviewees’
descriptions of company B. Therefore, being unable to locate individuals and similarly
clear role descriptions in company A, explains the level of frustration in the
interviewees as this was a significant difference in traits between the two cultures.

5.2 Personnel Issues
Findings in interviewees’ attitudes towards other cultures and ability to critically
evaluate their own culture supported Gupta’s (2010) findings on the effects of longitude
of employment relationships. What could be drawn from results is that interviewees
who had been employed by company B the longest found structure and clarity of their
organisational culture comforting but were unaware of its restrictions. These findings
53

Jutta Viskari
supported Goulet and Schweiger’s (2007) notion on the embeddedness of culture,
according to which cultural characteristics are deeply embedded within individuals to
the extent that employees are unable to communicate or rationalise them. Interviewees
who had been employed by the company longer were not necessarily able to recognise
cultural characteristics particular to their own culture but merely perceived them as best
practices for conducting business.
These interviewees also perceived their culture superior to the company A’s and had a
more negative perception company A’s culture, stating little to no negative traits in their
own culture but mentioning several negative traits in company A’s culture. Interviewees
perceiving their culture as superior to company A’s supports Goulet and Schweiger’s
(2007) findings, according to which feelings of superiority are likely to surface
especially in horizontal mergers where combining companies have similar operations.
According to Goulet and Schweiger (2007) feelings of cultural superiority enforce an
“us vs. them” mind-set. This was also supported by findings as interviewees inclined to
perceive their own culture superior, made a more clear distinction between the two
companies and their cultures. Interviewees with feelings of superiority whilst being
employed by the acquiring company support Junni’s (2012) findings according to which
feelings of superiority are likely to surface in target company’s employees but may also
surface in the acquiring company’s employees.
Interviewees whose employment relationships had lasted for a shorter period were able
to better evaluate and identify the restrictions and benefits of both companies’ cultures
and related more positively towards company A’s culture. These interviewees expressed
some frustration in company B’s culture describing it as rather inflexible due to its strict
processes and systems approach. These interviewees also perceived company A’s
flexibility and task approach more positively.

5.3 Cultural Learning and Social Integration
Based on findings, effects of cultural differences on the integration were most evident in
employees in charge of systems integration. Although company A’s operations were
preserved nearly intact, human resources systems were integrated fully with employees
1 and 2 being charge of tis execution. Other interviewees were in charge of different
54

Jutta Viskari
processes and were therefore less affected by cultural differences and unaware of the
difficulties in the systems integration.
The results supported findings of Goulet and Schweiger’s (2007) and Björkman, Stahl
and Vaara (2007) on the effects of cultural learning and social integration in mergers
and acquisitions. Goulet and Schweiger (2007) state that deep level cultural learning
improves employees' ability to understand opposing cultures and critically evaluate their
own. Deep levels of cultural learning mitigate cultural clashes and support the creation
of a combined culture. Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) refer to similar findings
emphasising the role of management in social integration. The majority of interviewees
stated little efforts were made to educate company B’s employees on company A and its
operations. Results indicated that level of learning depended on what tasks interviewees
were conducting in terms of the integration and learning was somewhat confined to
levels of department uninvolved in the systems integration.
Interviewees with more learning opportunities were empathetic towards company A’s
culture and understood its origins. These interviewees were also more motivated
towards creating a combined culture and had the ability to rationally evaluate which
characteristics of each culture were beneficial for operations and thus worth preserving.
Based on the findings, interviewees working on systems integration had less cultural
learning opportunities. These interviewees were more likely to have a negative
perception of company A’s culture and be less motivated towards creating a combined
culture. They were also inclined to perceive company B’s culture superior to company
A’s, which according to Goulet and Schweiger (2007) also derives from lack of
knowledge on other cultures. Interviewees with fewer learning opportunities were less
capable of critically and rationally evaluating both cultures than interviewees who were
offered more learning opportunities. Findings showed these interviewees experienced a
bigger culture shock during the integration further enforcing an “us vs. them” mind-set
among them.
Goulet and Schweiger (2007) also emphasise the importance of understanding in
cultural learning and its effects on cultural appreciation. The correlation between
understanding and appreciation of opposing cultures was supported by findings as
interviewees with less understanding of company A’s operations and culture, seemed to
appreciate it less. This was evident in how interviewees described company A’s culture.
Interviewees with less learning opportunities were likely to use unfavourable adjectives
55

Jutta Viskari
when describing company A’s culture whereas interviewees with increased learning
opportunities used more favourable adjectives.
Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) suggest techniques such as employee rotation,
visitations and joint task forces as means of social integration. Findings indicated such
techniques were implemented during the integration but excluded company B’s human
resources responsible for systems integration. Meetings between these interviewees and
company A were mainly focused on gathering information for the systems integration
rather than learning. Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) also argue that granting
autonomy for the target company supports social integration and limiting autonomy can
have the opposite effects. This was somewhat supported by findings as company B did
grant a certain level of autonomy for company A by preserving their operations but did
require highly integrated human resource processes and systems. Findings showed this
controversy caused confusion and frustration in one interviewee decreasing their
motivation towards the integration and building a shared culture.

5.4 Role of Management
Findings indicated that human issues were somewhat overlooked during the acquisition,
supporting Cartwright and Cooper’s (1992) research according to which management
tend to place more focus on financial and strategic issues during mergers and
acquisitions. Interviewees were uninvolved in the early decision-making stage of the
acquisition, many describing the integration process as a moving train to which they
merely jumped aboard. The experiences described by interviewees were similar to
Gupta’s (2010) findings according to which acquisitions and mergers are during the
early stages are largely processed behind closed doors including mainly lawyers and
financial managers and excluding human resources.
According to multiple sources managerial implications affect integration processes
heavily. This was evident in findings as the majority of interviewees felt the integration
was heavily under resourced in personnel and lacked the support of upper-level
management. Resourcing issues were overlooked by management as well as
interviewees requests for a project manager. Under resourcing was recognised by all
56

Jutta Viskari
interviewees as an issue which affected the integration process negatively with many
also underlining the need more involved management. Interviewees felt that improved
resources would have enabled better planning and increased focus to the process
bringing more structure and making it less arduous on the department.
Lakshman (2011) argues managers might overlook human resource issues due to lack of
understanding on the process and its effects on mergers and acquisitions. This was
supported by findings as interviewees stated management in company B had become
distant from the integration process from the perspective of human resources. What
could be determined was that interviewees felt unappreciated and unacknowledged by
management in terms of their work on integrations. This had resulted in a slightly
resentful and negative attitude towards integration processes in general. Interviewees
speculated perhaps the company’s management trusted human resources to an extent to
which they felt as if the department needed less of their support or recognition.
Along with resourcing issues, interviewees identified problems with communication as
a source of problems during the integration. Company B’s communications department
not partaking in the integration process supported Gupta’s (2010) findings according to
which communication is often overlooked by management. Gupta (2010) further argues
that intentions of the integration should be communicated clearly. Similarly Björkman,
Stahl and Vaara (2007) argue that communication needs to provide employees with
rationalisations for changes. By failing to do so employees are likely to be less
understanding and accepting of them. These arguments were evident in findings based
on which little was communicated to them about the integration. Consequently,
employees were somewhat confused about what was intended to be integrated and why.
Also, employees less involved in the integration process and thus provided with less
rationalisation were more apprehensive towards the changes inflicted by the integration.

5.5 Knowledge Transfer
What could be determined from findings is that majority of problems in knowledge
transfer during the integration stemmed from cultural differences since organisational
cultures had shaped the two companies into having and valuing different types of
57

Jutta Viskari
knowledge. Findings indicated company A representing task culture was more focused
on completing tasks rather than how tasks were completed. This resulted in a lack of
processes, due to which majority of knowledge possessed by company A’s employees
was tacit with little knowledge existing in written, explicit forms. Company B on the
other hand represented role culture relying heavily on agreed processes existing in
written, coded forms therefore relying heavily on explicit knowledge.
Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007) argue great cultural differences may affect
employees’ absorptive capacity. As explained in previous chapters absorptive capacity
refers to an individual’s ability and willingness to recognise, assimilate and exploit
knowledge from external sources. This was shown in findings as interviewees had due
to differences in knowledge types, challenges in locating, understanding and applying
knowledge from company A. According to Gammelgaard, Husted and Michailova
(2005) and Lyytinen, Heo and Yoo (2007) tacit knowledge has been widely recognised
as a barrier in knowledge transfer during integrations. This barrier was evident in
findings as it affected heavily interviewees’ absorptive capacity and therefore
knowledge transfer. Willingness to absorb knowledge was also affected by employees’
personal perceptions. Particularly interviewees employed by company B the longest
were inclined to knowledge rejecting behaviour and showed traits of the “not invented
here syndrome” which are attributed by Gammelgaard, Husted and Michailova (2005)
to absorptive capacity.
Due to the tacitness of company A’s knowledge, knowledge transfer depended on
company A’s employees’ disseminative capacity. Disseminative capacity, as described
by Junni (2012) and Björkman, Stahl and Vaara (2007), refer to an individual’s
willingness and ability to share knowledge. The study was incapable of evaluating
willingness of company A’s employees in sharing knowledge, findings did however
indicate towards company A employees’ inability to identify and share crucial
knowledge as interviewees consistently referred to inconsistency and unpredictability in
company A’s knowledge. This indicated that tacitness of company A’s knowledge
affected employees’ disseminative capacity, supporting Dalkir’s (2011) findings on the
matter.

58

Jutta Viskari
The implied inconsistency in company A’s knowledge also supported Briel, Schneider
and Lowry’s (2019) findings on knowledge complexity and its effects on absorptive
capacity. Based on findings knowledge in company A was particularly complex as
interviewees struggled with locating knowledge and expressed frustration with no one
in company A having an all-encompassing understanding of knowledge entities.
Lacking understanding on knowledge components and their interrelatedness created
challenges in applying knowledge to existing processes. What can therefore be
determined is addition to difficulties in recognising knowledge, complexity of
knowledge affected interviewees’ ability and willingness to assimilate and exploit
knowledge, affecting all stages of knowledge absorption.
As previously stated, social integration was extended to only parts of the human
resource department. Lack of social integration resulted in interviewees lacking
understanding of company A’s processes consequently affecting their ability to
recognise, assimilate and exploit knowledge. Findings therefore supported Björkman,
Stahl and Vaara’s (2007) findings connecting social integration to absorptive capacity.
Several issues during knowledge transfer and findings indicating lack of social
integration also supported Briel, Schneider and Lowry’s (2019) arguments on how
crucial social integration is to absorptive capacity and therefore knowledge transfer.
Findings showed little of Briel, Schneider and Lowry’s (2019) categorisations on
mechanisms fostering post-acquisition integration. Interviewees expressing criticism
towards resourcing and time constraints indicated little environmental social integration
mechanisms were applied during the integration. Similarly, interviewees having
difficulties in understanding how knowledge had been applied in company A and
therefore struggling with applying it to new contexts, indicated efforts in cognitive
social integration were scarce.
Interviewees stating the integration process was unclear suggested the process lacked
coordination and common goals, indicating the lack of mechanisms fostering
behavioural social integration. Traits of affective social integration were shown in
interviewees more socially integrated as these interviewees were more positive towards
company A, increasing their willingness to cooperate. In contrast, interviewees less
socially integrated, had little positive feelings towards company A, indicating
mechanisms of affective social integration were applied to only certain levels of the
department. The lack of social integration mechanisms could therefore be determined to
59

Jutta Viskari
contribute to difficulties in knowledge transfer by negatively affecting interviewees’
absorptive capacity.

5.6 Answering Research Questions
This thesis aimed to understand the effects of organisational culture on knowledge
transfer in post-acquisition integration. More specifically, the aim was to understand
how effects of cultural distance on knowledge transfer are impacted by managerial
implications and social integration. The research questions to which this thesis therefore
aimed to answer were:
-

Research question 1: How does social integration contribute to knowledge
transfer in mergers and acquisitions?

-

Research question 2: What is the role of management in shaping a culture
supporting knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions?

Before these questions could be answered, what needed to be understood were the
effects of organisational culture on knowledge transfer. Findings showed that respective
organisational cultures had shaped the two companies into preferring different
knowledge types, with company A preferring tacit and company B explicit knowledge.
Differences in knowledge types were found to affect both companies’ disseminative and
absorptive capacities, creating obstacles in knowledge transfer.
Cultural distance appeared in addition to different knowledge types in a number of
human related issues. Findings indicated human related issues such as negative attitudes
and “us vs. them” categorisations were heightened due to great cultural differences and
lack of understanding on combining company’s operations and culture.
Once the effects of cultural distance on knowledge transfer were understood and
identified, contribution of social integrations and managements’ role in the matter could
be evaluated.

60

Jutta Viskari
5.6.1 Research Question 1
This thesis contributes to the literature by showing that clear distinctions could be made
based on effects of social integration between interviewees presented with more and
interviewees presented with less cultural learning opportunities. However, this thesis
was unable to evaluate how effects of increased levels of social integration reflected on
knowledge transfer as tasks of interviewees within this group were less affected by
cultural distance. This thesis however, could evaluate how social integration contributed
to these interviewees attitudes towards company A’s culture, their ability to critically
evaluate both cultures and motivation towards creating a combined culture. These
results of the thesis are consistent with literature and previous findings that show these
factors were found as crucial to knowledge transfer.
Moreover, findings showed that interviewees with more learning opportunities and thus
more socially integrated better understood company A’s culture, its operations and
origins. Through understanding interviewees had become more empathetic towards
company A’s culture identifying positive features in its culture. Consequently, these
interviewees were able to also identify negative features within their own culture
understanding its limitations. By being able to critically evaluate both cultures, socially
integrated interviewees were more motivated towards creating a combined culture and
operations equally entailing features from both companies.
Findings indicated that interviewees less socially integrated lacked understanding on
company A’s culture and operations understanding little of about their origins. These
interviewees had less empathy towards company A and therefore had a somewhat more
negative perception of its culture and operations. Interviewees with less learning
opportunities identified little to no positive features in company A’s culture and little to
no negative features within their own culture. By being unable to critically evaluate
both cultures, these interviewees were hesitant and less motivated towards creating a
combined culture.
Also, the findings showed lack of social integration consequently affected knowledge
transfer through interviewees’ absorptive capacity. Since less socially integrated
interviewees lacked understanding on company A’s culture and operations, they
struggled in addition to locating knowledge in interpreting transferred knowledge and
applying it to company B’s processes. Additionally, absorptive capacity was found to be
61

Jutta Viskari
somewhat affected by interviewees attitudes and perceptions stemming from lack of
social integration. Interviewees having a more negative perception affected their ability
and willingness to apply transferred knowledge towards creating a combined culture
and processes.
Regarding the first research question, social integration increases employees
understanding on combining companies’ culture, their ability to critically evaluate both
cultures and affects attitudes towards the opposing culture. Lack of social integration
results in lack of understanding, inability to critically evaluate own and opposing
cultures and somewhat negative attitudes towards the opposing culture. The effects are
directly reflected on absorptive capacity affecting employees’ ability and willingness to
apply transferred knowledge. Due to lack of social integration employees are likely to
have difficulties in locating knowledge and interpreting and applying transferred
knowledge. Additionally, negative attitudes and perceptions of opposing company’s
culture and operations are likely to affect employees’ willingness to apply transferred
knowledge. Therefore, it can be concluded, based on the findings of this thesis that
social integration contributes to knowledge transfer in mergers and acquisitions by
affecting employees’ absorptive capacity.

5.6.2 Research Question 2
It is generally agreed in literature that failures in mergers and acquisitions are more
often due to management overlooking cultural and human related issues. Management
tends to in pre-merger/acquisition stages focus more on financial and strategic factors
rather than cultural compatibility and leave post-merger/acquisition integrations for
middle-level managers. The findings of this thesis showed that this was more or less the
case in this research as well and consistent with the literature. However, this thesis was
unable during this stage evaluates success rate of the acquisition, but could, based on
interviews assesses the effects of managements actions on the post-acquisition
integration. Interviewees stated little to no participation to the pre-acquisition phases
and received little support from upper-level management during the integration. What
can be therefore concluded is that the management of company B placed minor
consideration on significantly different cultures in pre-acquisition negotiations which
62

Jutta Viskari
consequently affected the post-acquisition integration. Integration was left largely to the
concern of company B’s human resource department receiving little support from
management although a project manager was requested by them to assist with the
process. More resources were requested as it became evident to human resources
department that the integration process would more arduous than expected. These
requests were however unacknowledged by management.
What could be determined from the findings is that the lack of resources resulted in a
tight schedule as one employee was responsible for multiple tasks. Multitasking during
the rather difficult integration resulted in lack of focus in the process and interviewees
having little opportunity to become acquainted with company A. Interviewees in charge
of the systems integration were presented with less learning opportunities which
reflected directly in their absorptive capacity during the knowledge transfer. Findings
also showed that by having fewer opportunities to become familiarised with company A
led to interviewees having more negative perceptions of company. Interviewees were
inclined to “us vs. them” categorisations and were less motivated towards integrating
processes and creating a combined culture. Such attitudes were found to deepen
negative effects of cultural differences on knowledge transfer.
Communication is crucial in mergers and acquisitions but was largely overlooked
during the integration. Little was communicated to interviewees about the acquisition
itself and company A, limiting their knowledge to rumours and external sources.
Additionally, communications department was for unknown reasons unengaged to the
integration, leaving communication to company B’s human resources. None of the
department’s employees having expertise on the matter, whilst managing multiple other
tasks, meant communications received minor attention.
Findings showed that managements’ role in supporting knowledge transfer is crucial
when integrating culturally distant companies. Management’s role in shaping culture
supporting knowledge transfer begins in pre-acquisition phases during which cultural
aspects should be evaluated along with the financial and the strategic aspects of the
merger/acquisition. Literature suggests that management should involve human
resources during pre-merger/acquisition stages in order to thoroughly evaluate
organisational culture and its potential effects in integration processes later on. Based on
63

Jutta Viskari
the findings this would have benefitted the case of company A and B as perhaps
management of neither company possessed sufficient amounts of knowledge on both
companies’ culture and human resource processes.
What can be argued based on the findings is that by acknowledging cultural differences
during early stages companies may better prepare for their effects on the integration. By
acknowledging the effects of cultural differences managers should also consider how
personnel in charge of the integration are resourced. If combining organisations have
drastically different cultures, more issues can be expected to be caused by them,
potentially requiring more personnel to manage integration. Resourcing can mean hiring
external employees or ensuring that sufficient amounts of employees are able to focus
solely on the integration process. With sufficient resources, employees conducting the
integration are able to better focus on specific tasks and become acquainted with the
combining company. Improved resourcing additionally requires acknowledging
professional limits of existing employees and departments and providing support where
needed. Based on findings, management engaging communications and appointing a
project manager to the integration process would have brought significant benefits.
Improved resources and capable support allow more time for employees conducting the
integration to focus on issues contributing to knowledge transfer whilst mitigating
human related issues.
Regarding the second research question, based on the finds of the thesis, the role of
management is firstly to acknowledge and evaluate differences in organisational
cultures and their potential effects on the post-acquisition/merger integration during premerger/acquisition stages. Secondly, managements’ role is to ensure that sufficient
support and resources are provided for the integration considering differences in
organisational cultures.
These measures ensure that employees executing the integration have sufficient time to
become acquainted with the combined company and are able to focus on tasks within
their lines of expertise. Although these measures are not directly related to knowledge
transfer, they contribute to a culture supporting knowledge transfer by mitigating the
effects of cultural issues and enabling employees to focus more on the process and their
core competencies.

64

Jutta Viskari

6 Limitations and Further Research
The scope of the study was limited to the human resource of company B. Limiting the
scope was appropriate due to the post-acquisition integration of company A and B being
mainly focused on human resource processes and selected interviewees were employees
most involved in the integration from the perspective of human resources. Involving
other departments would not have brought significant benefits to this thesis, however
receiving perspectives from managers especially involved in the decision making
processes during pre-acquisition stages would have allowed a deeper assessment of the
research topics. Receiving justification (or lack thereof) behind decisions and decision
making processes would have brought an interesting perspective and potentially more
depth to the findings. Further research evaluating the role of management in building a
culture supporting knowledge transfer should therefore aim to receive the input of
higher levels of management as well.
The scope of this study was also limited by the relatively small human resource
department and the amount of employees involved in the post-acquisition integration
process. Although interviewees had differing experiences in terms of the integration and
conclusive findings could be made based on the results of the interviews, a larger scope
could have provided more variability to findings. By studying larger companies or
departments, further research could evaluate the contribution of social integration and
role of management in knowledge transfer from a broader perspective.
This thesis was able to only evaluate how the lack of social integration affected
knowledge transfer, since interviewees dependent on knowledge transfer were less
socially integrated. Interviewees more socially integrated were less involved within the
systems integration and their tasks therefore being less dependable on knowledge
transfer. The contribution of social integration on knowledge transfer could have been
evaluated more thoroughly if interviewees more socially integrated were involved tasks
requiring knowledge transfer. Further research should therefore consider including
individuals exposed to varying levels of social integration but also involved in processes
requiring knowledge transfer.

65

Jutta Viskari
Findings showed that knowledge transfer from the target company to the acquiring
company was significantly impacted by social integration and the role of management,
through how they impacted employees’ in charge of the integration process. It would
have however been interesting to assess how employees of the acquired company
experienced the integration process. Involving employees from the target company
would have broadened the study by bringing an alternative perspective to the research
topics. By assessing how employees of the acquired organisation perceive the acquiring
organisation, and by identifying efforts in social integration and how actions of the
management reflected on the integration process from their perspective, further research
could evaluate how these factors impact knowledge transfer from the acquiring to the
target organisation. Involving the target organisation would also enable a more
comprehensive evaluation of knowledge transfer within the integration process
altogether when comparing experiences of both companies.
It would be useful for further research to therefore explore social integration efforts and
the role of management from the perspective of both the acquiring and the acquired
organisation and how they impact knowledge transfer between both companies. When
evaluating knowledge transfer it would be interesting for future research to also
compare how significant and moderate organisational cultures reflect on the effects of
social integration and how the need role of management varies depending on cultural
distance.
