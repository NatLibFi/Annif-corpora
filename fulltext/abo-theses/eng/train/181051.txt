Abstract:
Over the past decades, the European Court of Human Rights has become overwhelmed by the
massive numbers of applicants constantly lodging their complaints with the Court. In the early
2000s, the Court noted that over half of all its judgments concerned repetitive applications
complaining of the same systemic violation, and introduced the pilot-judgment procedure in
2004.
The pilot-judgment procedure allows the Court to examine a complaint beyond the situation of
the single applicant, directing the respondent State to solve the underlying problem and introduce
remedies at the domestic level. The pilot-judgment procedure also allows the adjournment of all
repetitive applications while pending the introduction of remedial measures at the domestic level.
However, since the introduction of the pilot-judgment procedure, the Court has routinely sought
to address systemic human rights violations even outside the explicit application of the procedure.
In so-called quasi-pilot judgments, the Court indicates general remedial measures but does not
employ all elements of the ‘full’ procedure.
The characteristics of both pilot and quasi-pilot judgments vary extensively, and often it remains
unclear why the Court selected a certain approach. Furthermore, distinguishing between pilot and
quasi-pilot judgments is not always easy. The procedure crucially allows flexibility, but at the
same time, to the outside eye the procedure appears unpredictable and inconsistent.
By studying how the Court has in practice applied relevant legal instruments, this thesis
undertakes to clarify which considerations influence the selection of the approach. The thesis will
show that although certain patterns in the practice of the Court can be detected, much remains
inconsistent and lacking transparency.
The study will find that since the adoption of the first pilot and quasi-pilot judgments, some
aspects have been streamlined and clarified. In case-law from the last ten years or so, the Court
has been increasingly clear in the differentiation of pilot judgments from quasi-pilot judgments.
Yet, for the vast part, it remains unclear how the Court selects its response to a particular systemic
problem. This thesis will find that the Court seems to take into consideration for example the
level of cooperation of the respondent state and the complexity of the substantive issue at hand.
Furthermore, when the Court has identified a systemic problem, its first response is only rarely a

‘full’ pilot judgment. More typically, the Court will employ the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure
only after numerous declaratory and quasi-pilot judgments in respect of the same systemic
problem have been delivered, but proved unsuccessful.

1. Introduction
1.1. Overburdening of the Court and Introduction of the Pilot-Judgment Procedure
The European Court of Human Rights (the Court, or the Strasbourg Court) is infamously
overburdened by the number of individual applications it receives. There are many reasons for the
massive number of applications lodged. One is that of widespread, systemic problems which affect
hundreds or even thousands of people, resulting in repetitive applications complaining of the same
systemic problem.
Since the beginning of the 2000s, the Court, together with the other bodies of the Council of Europe,
has sought to address the problem of repetitive judgments. In 2003, the Explanatory Report to
Protocol 14 recognised that the Court delivered a total of 703 judgments, out of which 60 per cent
concerned repetitive issues.1 In 2004, the pilot-judgment procedure was adopted after the issuing of
resolution Res(2004)3 by the Committee of Ministers (CM). The pilot-judgment procedure was
introduced to better identify underlying systemic problems and the sources to those problems.2 The
execution process would be clarified, since the Court were to both identify the underlying problem
as well as the measures needed to address it in the pilot judgment.3 In 2011, the pilot-judgment
procedure was incorporated into the Rules of Court, Rule 61, therefore strengthening its legal basis.
Through the pilot-judgment procedure, the Court does not need to examine all repetitive cases
separately. In practice, if the Court identifies a systemic problem when examining cases, it can choose
one case (or a group of cases) to be examined as the pilot. The pilot judgment will then serve as an
example to help solve the broader problem and be applied to the remaining repetitive cases at the
domestic level. The pilot-judgment procedure gives the Court the opportunity to adjourn all repetitive
cases pending the examination and execution of the pilot by domestic authorities, reducing backlog,
and allowing the Court to better focus on other issues as well.4

The execution of the pilot judgment is indeed critical to effectively solve the underlying systemic
problem, and hence, the Court has grown more aware of execution matters.5 To assist the CM in the
execution of pilot judgments, Rule 61(3) of the Rules of Court specifically provides that the Court
shall identify “[…] the type of remedial measures which the Contracting Party concerned is required
to take at the domestic level by virtue of the operative provisions of the judgment.” 6 Hence every
pilot judgment has indications of remedial measures in the operative provisions, as provided for by
Rule 61(3).
The CM therefore encouraged the Court to indicate remedial measures in pilot judgments to make
the execution process more effective, and this practice was later also codified in the Rules of Court.
However, the Court has not limited itself to only indicating general measures in pilot judgments. Socalled quasi-pilot judgments resemble pilot judgments in that they also concern systemic problems,
and the Court indicates general measures for the respondent state to take. However, in a quasi-pilot
judgment, the Court does not employ the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure as provided for in the Rules
of Court, but instead opts for a ‘hybrid’ version of it.

1.2. Research Questions and Aim of the Thesis
The aim of this thesis is to study how the Court responds to systemic human rights violations. One of
the most prominent responses to systemic problems is the pilot-judgment procedure, but the Court
does not apply the procedure to all systemic problems. The application of the pilot-judgment
procedure will be examined throughout the thesis in parallel with other responses where the Court
did not apply the pilot-judgment procedure. By doing so, this thesis seeks to create a comprehensive
analysis of the mechanisms that the Court uses to address systemic problems.
The research questions are: What defines a pilot judgment? Which factors invite the Court to apply
the pilot-judgment procedure in cases where it has identified a systemic problem? Further, which
factors affect the Court’s decision when choosing the type of mechanisms to apply both in pilots and
other judgments?7 To answer the questions and create a comprehensive analysis, this thesis will
examine elements of both ‘full’ pilot judgments and so-called quasi-pilot judgments.

(ECtHR), para. 234, and Donald and Speck, 2017, p. 93.

Such ”mechanisms” applied by the Court in this sense entails, for example, the type of general measures indicated or
the adjourning of similar applications.

Earlier studies have found that interlocutors at the Court find the flexibility of the Court’s procedures
to be an asset.8 Many argue that flexibility is essential, since systemic problems are so different in
every case. In Rutkowski and others v. Poland from 2015, the Court itself emphasised that “[…] one
of the important features of the pilot-judgment procedure is its flexibility, enabling the Court to adapt
it to a variety of legal and factual situations in different States and to its own caseload developments
[…]”.9
However, to the outside eye, the pilot-judgment procedure and other ‘hybrid’ forms of it lack
foreseeability and transparency. Therefore, this thesis will carry out a comprehensive analysis,
scrutinising the approaches utilised by the Court when tackling systemic problems in judgments.
In addition to the various forms of pilot judgments, the Court has developed a number of other
mechanisms to help reduce its caseload resulting especially from repetitive cases. For example, since
the entry into force of Protocol 14, a Committee consisting of three judges can declare admissible and
even render a judgment if an application is the subject of “well-established case-law of the Court”.10
Another innovation was the Single Judge procedure, also initiated by Protocol 14; if an application is
clearly inadmissible, a Single Judge may declare it as such.11 However, such mechanisms will not be
studied for the purposes of this thesis; instead, the aim is to study judgments where the Court has
identified, or could have identified, a new systemic problem and the approach or approaches it selects
to tackle it.12 Only the Chambers and the Grand Chamber may adopt decisions or judgments in cases
where no established case law exists.13
After this introductory chapter, chapter 2 will examine distinguishing features of pilot judgments and
quasi-pilot judgments, how the Court identifies systemic problems, and how the practice has
developed in recent years. Chapter 3 will discuss in more detail how the Court appears to select its
approach in a particular case after a systemic problem has been identified. Chapter 4 will then focus
on another mechanism that was introduced through the pilot-judgment procedure: the adjournment
of repetitive applications, and the several forms in which the Court decides to adjourn or not adjourn

them. The Court has taken a more active role in the field of execution through these approaches by
going beyond the issue of a single case.14 Although issues surrounding the new role of the Court will
rise throughout the thesis, chapter 5 will further examine the Court’s role in the execution of pilot and
quasi-pilot judgments.

1.3. Material and Method
The relevant primary source of this thesis is the European Convention of Human Rights (the
Convention), and especially article 46 on the binding force and execution of judgments. Although the
majority of judgments adopted by the Court are declaratory in nature, the Court sometimes indicates
remedial measures under article 46 for the respondent state to take. For the purposes of this thesis,
general remedial measures will be studied, since they concern the broader situation beyond the single
applicant.
Article 46(1) simply provides that “The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final
judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.” It therefore does not explicitly grant the
Court the power to indicate remedial measures, an issue which will be discussed further in the thesis.
To analyse the application of the pilot-judgment procedure, Rule 61 of the Rules of Court is of utmost
importance. Rule 61 on the pilot-judgment procedure was incorporated into the Rules of Court in
2011, codifying the application of the procedure, although the Court had delivered pilot judgments
since 2004. It must be noted that only the Convention may establish competences of the Court, and
the Rules of Court cannot establish any new powers without a legal basis in the Convention. The
addition of Rule 61 may therefore only be seen as having codified a practice that was already applied
by the Court within the powers conferred to it by the Convention.15
By studying the case-law of the Court, emphasis will be on how the Convention provisions and the
Rules of Court have been applied in practice. Of value are also earlier studies by qualified academics
who have had the chance to interview officials within the Court, including judges, providing inside
information on their experience about work ‘on the ground’. Therefore, by analysing the practical
application of legal provisions, the thesis follows a legal dogmatic method.

systemic problems, or even pilot judgments, the Annual Reports on the Supervision of Execution of

Judgments and Decisions of the Committee of Ministers have been used extensively to identify such
judgments. Since its 7th Annual Report, from 2013, the reports have included an explicit list of both
pilot judgments and “Judgments with indications of relevance for the execution (under article 46)”.16
These categorisations make it considerably easier to find relevant case-law from 2013 onwards than
earlier. Due to the absence of an effective search tool for pilot or quasi-pilot judgments in HUDOC,
this thesis cannot guarantee to have exhaustively examined all case-law addressing systemic
problems.

2. Identifying and Responding to Systemic Problems
2.1. ‘Full’ Pilot Judgments
The pilot-judgment procedure was incorporated into the Rules of Court in 2011, hence codifying the
procedure.17 The first part of Rule 61 provides that
The Court may initiate a pilot-judgment procedure and adopt a pilot judgment where the facts of an
application reveal in the Contracting Party concerned the existence of a structural or systemic problem
or other similar dysfunction which has given rise or may give rise to similar applications.

The Rules of Court do not define the terms ‘structural’, ‘systemic’, or ‘other similar dysfunction’,
and the Court has never clarified the terms either. Resolution Res(2004)3, which initially introduced
the pilot-judgment procedure in 2004, only mentioned the term ‘systemic’, and in the earliest pilot
judgments Broniowski and Hutten-Czapska, the Court also only used the term ‘systemic’.18 In the
Burdov (no.2) pilot judgment, the Court used the term ‘structural’ for the first time, and this time, the
Court even referred to the underlying problems in the earlier cases Broniowski and Hutten-Czapska
as ‘structural’ instead of ‘systemic’.19 Since no explanation can be found, the terms appear
interchangeable.20
In order to use consistent language, this thesis will use the term ‘systemic’, unless the underlying
problem in a particular case is described by the Court solely as ‘structural’. In that case, the language
used by the Court will be mirrored when discussing the particular case.
Rule 61(2)(a) goes on to provide that before the procedure is initiated, the Court must seek the views
of the parties to the case on the structural or systemic nature of the problem and the suitability of
applying the pilot-judgment procedure. Unless this procedural obligation is fulfilled, a judgment
cannot be considered a ‘full’ pilot judgment.21

In pilot judgments, the Court always indicates general measures in the operative provisions of the
judgment, as provided for by Rule 61(3) on the pilot-judgment procedure. Some sources state that the
indication of remedial measures in the operative part of the judgment is defining for a pilot judgment,
but in reality, it is not quite as simple.22 It is true that in quasi-pilot judgments, the Court more
commonly suffices to indicate general measures in the reasoning of the judgment only. There are,
however, judgments where the Court has indicated general measures in the operative provisions
without expressly applying the pilot-judgment procedure.23 In such judgments, it is not always easy
to distinguish whether the pilot-judgment procedure was, in fact, applied – this question will arise in
relation to several judgments throughout this thesis.
Rule 61 does not provide an exhaustive definition of the pilot-judgment procedure, and several
academics mention the complexity of jurisprudence in the area.24 Still, only few question why the
jurisprudence is complex and inconsistent, and whether it should be more foreseeable. Judge
Sicilianos, writing extra-judicially, notes the difficulty of distinguishing the features of a quasi-pilot
judgment from a pilot judgment.25 Although briefly analysing the many features that pilot judgments
and quasi-pilot judgments have in common, Sicilianos still does not discuss why the Court decides to
invoke – or not invoke – the pilot-judgment procedure in certain cases.
Wallace argues that the existence of quasi-pilot judgments as a “sub-category” in itself is an indication
of inconsistency in the jurisprudence of the Court.26 However, his study is focused on the pilotjudgment procedure and merely mentions quasi-pilot judgments, leaving out any further analysis on
the matter. The statement is truly thought-provoking: it is indeed unclear why, in quasi-pilot
judgments, the Court does not apply the pilot-judgment procedure instead. Clearly, the Court has
identified a systemic problem since it seems fit to indicate general measures.

There is no absolute definition as to the features required of a ‘full’ pilot judgment. In a study from
2010, Philip Leach identified that six ‘full’ pilot judgments had been delivered at the time, and
identified the following common characteristics of the judgments:
(i)

the explicit application by the Court of the pilot judgment procedure;

(ii)

the identification by the Court of a systemic violation of the Convention;

(iii)

general measures are stipulated in the operative part of the judgment in order that the respondent
state should resolve the systemic issue (which may be subject to specific time limits). 27

He therefore suggested that these be the criteria that define a pilot judgment. It must be kept in mind
that the study was conducted before 2011, so the pilot-judgment procedure was not yet codified in
the Rules of Court. However, these criteria are still often referred to by authors also in more recent
literature.28
Interestingly, Leach proposed these criteria because according to him, all six ‘full’ pilot judgments
that were identified shared these same characteristics. When examining these judgments – Broniowski
v. Poland, Hutten-Czapska v. Poland, Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), Olaru and others v. Moldova, Yuriy
Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine and Suljagic v. Bosnia and Herzegovina – one can differentiate the
application of the procedure in Broniowski from the others.29 In the Broniowski judgment on the
merits from 2004, the Court never expressly applied the pilot-judgment procedure. It was only in the
friendly settlement judgment, from 2005, when the Court explicitly stated that it had indeed applied
the pilot-judgment procedure to the case.30 Tomov and others v. Russia from 2019 is another example
of a pilot judgment where the Court did not expressly invoke the pilot-judgment procedure in the
judgment, but which has all elements of a pilot judgment and is identified as a pilot judgment by the
CM.31 Hence, for the purposes of this thesis, the lack of explicit application by the Court of the pilotjudgment procedure will not automatically categorise a judgment merely as a quasi-pilot.

In addition to Leach, other authors have similarly suggested definitions for pilot judgments; Luzius
Wildhaber, President of the Court at the time of the Broniowski case, took a stricter approach. In
2007, he identified the “main elements” of the judgment, which included the oft-repeated elements
that the Court discloses a systemic problem which may give rise to numerous subsequent applications,
and the Court indicates general measures and uses also the operative part to reinforce said measures.32
Wildhaber, however, went further and recognised that for the judgment to be considered a pilot, it
must be adopted by the Grand Chamber, all pending applications deriving from the same cause must
be adjourned, the general measures indicated must have retroactive effect, and information about the
approach must be communicated to the CM and the other bodies of the Council of Europe.33 He
commented particularly on the issue of adjourning repetitive applications, stating that “[u]nless the
Court adjourns them, the procedure is hardly a pilot judgment procedure. There is always a close
connection with the enormity of the Court’s workload”.34
Of course, this was also before the procedure was codified in the Rules of Court, which now expressly
state that the examination of all similar applications may be adjourned “as appropriate”, and therefore
the adjourning of similar applications cannot be considered a requirement for pilot judgments today.35
There are examples of ‘full’ pilot judgments where the Court decided not to adjourn repetitive
applications, a practice which will be further discussed in chapter 4.
The Rules of Court also do not prevent Chambers from applying the pilot-judgment procedure, and
so it would be difficult today to argue why such judgments should be relinquished to the Grand
Chamber only.36 Leach, however, did not propose that all pilot judgments must be delivered by the
Grand Chamber, and additionally, noted only that a pilot judgment may adjourn all similar
applications, but did not include it as a proposed criterium for a pilot judgment (even though at the
time, all pilot judgments had indeed adjourned all similar pending applications).37 His suggestions
for the definition of a pilot judgment better reflect the most common perceptions of a ‘full’ pilot
judgment today, which is perhaps the reason his study is still often referred to.

2.2. Quasi-Pilot Judgments
The term ‘quasi-pilot judgment’ is used to describe judgments that are not merely declaratory, but
where the Court instead addresses a systemic problem and indicates general measures under article
46. Quasi-pilot judgments resemble pilot judgments, but do not bear all the characteristics; typically,
general measures are only indicated in the reasoning of the judgment, and not imposed in the operative
provisions. Furthermore, the Court rarely adjourns repetitive applications in quasi-pilot judgments.
Since the Court does not employ the ‘full’ procedure, it does not ask the parties to submit information
on the systemic nature of the problem.38
The term quasi-pilot has not been used by the Court, but it is a common term found in literature to
describe judgments that resemble pilot judgments. The CM has also used the term, for example in its
Annual Report from 2012:
The European Court’s interaction with the Committee of Ministers, in implementing Article 46, is
constantly evolving. For several years now, the Court contributes to the execution process more and more
frequently and in various ways, e.g. by providing, itself, in its judgments recommendations as to relevant
execution measures (so called quasi-pilot judgments or ‘Article 46 judgments’) [...]39

Quasi-pilot judgments follow no distinct procedure comparable to the pilot-judgment procedure. It is
a categorisation of judgments that merely resemble pilot judgments. Unfortunately, it often remains
unclear why the Court decides to use this sort of ‘hybrid’ between a pilot and an ordinary, declaratory
judgment.
Interestingly, the Court sometimes refers to earlier quasi-pilot judgments as pilot judgments. For
example, in the pilot judgment Kurić and others v. Slovenia, the Court expressly referred to “the pilot
judgment Lukenda v. Slovenia”.40 However, although the Court did indicate general measures in the

operative provisions in Lukenda, it did not expressly apply the pilot-judgment procedure and did not
discuss the option of adjourning repetitive applications.41
Similarly, the quasi-pilot judgments Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey and Scordino v. Italy have in later caselaw occasionally been referred to as pilot judgments.42 The categorisation of Xenides-Arestis as either
pilot or quasi-pilot is difficult, but the Scordino case can hardly be considered a pilot judgment since
general measures were indicated in the reasoning only.43 This, again, seems to indicate the flexible
way in which the Court interprets the pilot-judgment procedure and the categorisation of pilot
judgments; these judgments are all responses to address systemic problems, although the Court did
not adhere to the strict application of the pilot-judgment procedure.

2.3. Defining Systemic Problems
2.3.1. Identification of the Underlying Problem
When the Court issues a quasi-pilot or pilot judgment, it usually makes an assessment on the systemic
nature of the problem. Especially to apply the pilot-judgment procedure, the Court must first identify
a “structural or systemic problem or other similar dysfunction which has given rise or may give rise
to similar applications”.44 The requirement is two-fold; there must exist a systemic problem, and that
problem must have given rise or possibly give rise to similar applications.
Systemic human rights violations in this sense are most often attributable to deficiencies in the
legislation or administrative practices of the State party.45 Such systemic deficiencies reveal failures
of the state party in fulfilling its obligations under the Convention.46 The Court stated already in
Broniowski that the denial of the applicant’s right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions

41

The Court always discusses the option of adjourning repetitive applications in pilot judgments, even when the outcome
is not to adjourn them. See chapter 4.

[…] was neither prompted by an isolated incident nor attributable to the particular turn of events in his
case, but was rather the consequence of administrative and regulatory conduct on the part of the
authorities towards an identifiable class of citizens […]47

The identification of a systemic problem and its underlying causes is essential in pilot judgments to
assist the respondent state in finding the right remedial measures for execution of the judgment. The
other essential requirement, that the problem must affect a large number of individuals, relates again
to the need to effectively resolve the violation in order to both prevent and relieve the ever-growing
workload of the Court. Application of the pilot-judgment procedure is intended to be beneficial to the
individual applicants as well, since a more effective and streamlined procedure to address the
systemic problem means that their case is more effectively resolved.48
Only one pilot judgment can be found where the Court used only the great number of applicants as
an indication of a systemic problem – Ališić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia,
Slovenia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 2014. In all other ‘full’ pilot
judgments, the Court has made a separate assessment on the underlying problem giving rise to the
applications. Ališić and others is a complex case, but essentially it concerned violations of the right
to peaceful enjoyment of property (article 1 of Protocol 1) and the right to an effective remedy (article
13 of the Convention). The applicants, who had been citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic, had
made foreign-currency savings but had been unable to withdraw them due to a series of events and
the absence of an agreement between the successor states.49 The number of similar applications were
over 1,800, lodged by over 8,000 applicants.50 The Court seems to have based its finding of a systemic
problem solely off of the high number of repetitive applications, since no further assessment was
made on the nature of the problem.
In all other pilot judgments, recognising the sheer number of similar applications has only been part
of the broader assessment made by the Court about the systemic nature of an underlying problem.
The following sections will further explore to what extent the number of repetitive applications
influence the Court’s decision to apply the pilot-judgment procedure.

2.3.2. Significance of the Number of Applications
As of February 2021, the number of pending applications allocated to a judicial formation of the
Court is 65,100.51 The enormous workload caused by the number of pending cases was one of the
main reasons to introduce the pilot-judgment procedure in 2004.
Rule 61(1) of the Rules of Court provides that the Court may initiate the procedure if a systemic
problem “[…] has given rise or may give rise to similar applications.” Therefore, to apply the pilotjudgment procedure, a great number of applications is not explicitly required. A systemic problem
that may give rise to similar applications is sufficient.
However, case-law of the Court reveals that the pilot-judgment procedure has only been applied when
a systemic problem already has given rise to repetitive applications. The number of repetitive
applications has varied extensively; in Hutten-Czapska v. Poland, the number of repetitive
applications was a modest 18, while for example in Greens and M.T. v. United Kingdom, the number
of repetitive applications was approximately 2,500.52
Indeed, the small number of pending applications in Hutten-Czapska did not prevent the Court from
invoking the pilot-judgment procedure; although it must be noted that the actual number of applicants
was higher than 18, as one of the applications had been lodged by an association of approximately
200 applicants.53
In the judgment, the Court argued that the application of the pilot-judgment procedure does not have
to be linked, or based on, the number of similar pending applications, which is true, based on Rule
61(1) of the Rules of Court.54 The Court further argued that it must take into consideration the
potential inflow of future applications, and so prevent potential backlog before it happens.55 The case

pending applications was at a high of 119,298 (statistics from the Court’s Annual Report from 2009, p. 140). Various
reforms, such as the pilot-judgment procedure, have evidently relieved a great part of its workload.

concerned inadequate housing legislation, and the Court estimated that as many as 100,000 landlords
in Poland were affected by the legislation.56
It seems that the potential inflow of future applications alone is not sufficient for the Court to invoke
the pilot-judgment procedure, although the Rules of Court would not prevent it. So far, the Court has
never invoked the pilot-judgment procedure unless repetitive cases already existed.
For example, in the case Suso Musa v. Malta, the Court identified serious weaknesses in the
respondent state’s legislation but refrained from applying the pilot-judgment procedure. The
applicant, an irregular immigrant, had been detained in Malta for 18 months without an effective
remedy that would have allowed him to challenge the lawfulness of his detention.57 The Court
therefore stated that the respondent state must “[…] secure in its domestic legal order a mechanism
which allows individuals taking proceedings to determine the lawfulness of their detention […]”.58
Furthermore, the Court concluded that both the duration of his detention and the inadequate
conditions of the detention facility amounted to a violation of article 5(1) of the Convention. The
Court recommended that the respondent state take the necessary general measures to improve the
conditions of detention as well as limit the detention periods in the context of immigration.59 The
general measures were indicated in the reasoning of the judgment only, which is typical for quasipilot judgments.
The Court motivated the indication of general measures by, inter alia, stating that the identified
problems may give rise to numerous applications in the future.60 This argument can be found in both
pilot judgments and quasi-pilot judgments. The difference seems to be whether, at the time of the
judgment, similar applications already have been lodged. In the case of Suso Musa, the Court referred
to just one previous judgment regarding the issue.61 There were eventually five cases under the Suso
Musa group when the CM closed its supervision of them in 2016, declaring that all individual and
general measures had been implemented.62

The number of repetitive applications was only a handful, and the Court did not give any estimation
as to how many individuals were potentially affected. However, it is apparent from the Suso Musa
group of cases that Malta, as a small island nation at the external border of the EU, had had difficulties
in coping with the influx of immigrants.63 Considering that Malta had had problems with the number
of arriving immigrants, coupled with the issues raised by the applicants in just these five cases, one
can only imagine the number of possible similar applications that the Court could have received. The
group of people affected was presumably by no means limited to these five applicants, as the Court
itself noted in Suso Musa. However, it made no further assessment on the scope or systemic nature
of the problem, although it is implicit in the judgment.
The small number of repetitive applications is, however, not a sufficient answer as to why the Court
refrains from invoking the pilot-judgment procedure in certain cases. While the Court has refrained
from invoking the pilot-judgment procedure when there have been no similar applications pending,
it has in some cases refrained from invoking the pilot-judgment procedure despite great numbers of
similar pending applications. The following section will examine cases where the Court clearly
identified large-scale human rights violations which had already resulted in numerous repetitive
applications, but the Court refrained from invoking the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure.

2.3.3. Systemic Problem, But No Pilot Judgment
The case of Scordino v. Italy is an early example of a quasi-pilot judgment where numerous similar
applications were already pending. As the case is from 2006, the first pilot judgment Broniowski v.
Poland had been adopted only two years earlier. Scordino is a complex case, essentially concerning
the excessive length of domestic judicial proceedings and property rights regarding adequate
compensation for expropriated land. The Grand Chamber found violations of the right to peaceful
enjoyment of possessions (article 1 of protocol 1) and the right to a fair trial (article 6(1)).
The Grand Chamber indicated general measures under article 46 in paragraphs 182-189 of the
judgment. The measures were not imperative, but instead resembled suggestions to help the state
party execute the judgment. For example, the Grand Chamber noted that preventive measures were

the best solution; instead of only instituting a remedy to compensate victims of lengthy judicial
proceedings, it would be more effective to organise the domestic judicial system so that it can meet
the requirements and keep up with its caseload.64
In the judgment, the Court noted that there were “hundreds” of similar applications from Italy, all
concerning the length of proceedings in similar expropriation of property cases.65 For some reason it
still refrained from invoking the pilot-judgment procedure. A year later, in the just satisfaction
judgment of Scordino v. Italy (no. 3), the Court, again, noted that no effective remedy was in place,
but made no explanation as to why not invoke the pilot-judgment procedure.66
The Scordino cases are already 15 years old, but the Court has taken a similar approach in more recent
case-law. For example, Luli and others v. Albania from 2014 also concerned the excessive length of
judicial proceedings. The judgment encompassed six applications on the same issue, which the Court
had joined. In the judgment, the Court also referred to several previous judgments concerning the
same issue.67
Furthermore, the Court noted that there were several dozens of similar applications pending.68
Clearly, there was not just a risk of future similar applications – similar applications, and even
judgments on the same issue, existed already.
In the judgment, the Court indicated general measures “[…] so that the Court does not have to reiterate
its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases”. 69 The Court even continued by
“drawing attention” to Resolution Res2004(3) and Recommendation Rec 2004(6) of the Committee
of Ministers regarding the effectiveness of the Convention system.70 Despite this, the judgment did
not so much as even mention the possibility of invoking the pilot-judgment procedure, and general
measures were indicated in the reasoning of the judgment only. The Court referred to the general

measures indicated in Scordino v. Italy regarding excessive length of proceedings, providing a
number of examples of remedies that the respondent state could utilise to comply with the judgment.71
As this chapter has demonstrated, the Court has so far not invoked the pilot-judgment procedure
unless a number of similar applications were already pending before it. The Rules of Court do not
provide for such a requirement, but perhaps the Court does not want to depart from the initial
intentions of pilot judgments, one of which was to relieve the burden of having to examine repetitive
cases.
What is more difficult to explain are the cases were repetitive applications already did exist, but the
Court still did not invoke the pilot-judgment procedure. In these cases, the Court indicated general
measures to remedy the problems and to prevent the future inflow of similar applications. However,
since it did not adopt a pilot judgment, all repetitive applications remained for the Court to examine
separately.
Over the years, the decision to apply the pilot-judgment procedure or another ‘hybrid’ form of it has
rarely been consistent or predictable. The following section will further look into certain ‘trends’
concerning pilot judgments and quasi-pilot judgments, such as the substantive issues these judgments
have sought to tackle, the frequency of pilot judgments and quasi-pilot judgments issued, and how
they have changed over the years.

2.4. Prevalence of Pilot Judgments and Quasi-Pilot Judgments
In recent years, the number of new pilot judgments has been sparse. In 2020, 2019, 2017, and 2016
only one pilot judgment was issued each year; in 2018, the Court did not issue a single pilot
judgment.72 It is, however, impossible to assess the Court’s enthusiasm to issue pilot judgments in
the future – the number of pilot judgments issued by year has fluctuated since the introduction of the
procedure in 2004. Between 2006 and 2008, the Court did not issue a single pilot judgment, but in
the following years, it picked up on the practice again. It culminated in 2012, when a record-breaking

72

17

number of seven pilot judgments were issued, and since then, the number has varied between zero
and four per year.73
The number of quasi-pilot judgments issued by year has constantly been slightly higher than that of
pilot judgments.74 For example, in 2020 the CM identified 13 judgments with remedial indications,
nine of which concerned general (as opposed to individual) measures.75 However, considering that
the Court delivered a total of 871 judgments in 2020, the vast majority of them remain declaratory in
nature.76
Interestingly, in all four pilot judgments adopted between 2016 and 2020, the Court found violations
of article 3 relating to inadequate conditions of detention (although one of the cases related solely to
the transport of prisoners).77 Out of three pilot judgments issued in 2015, an additional two cases
concerned inhuman or degrading treatment in detention.78 The third pilot judgment from 2015
concerned the excessive length of domestic judicial proceedings.79
The substantive rights addressed in pilot judgments have varied somewhat, but there seem to have
been certain ‘trends’. All but two pilot judgments have fallen into one of four categories: excessively
lengthy domestic judicial proceedings, non-enforcement of domestic judicial decisions, property
rights, or inhuman or degrading treatment in detention.80
Based on views expressed by former president of the Court Luzius Wildhaber, Kindt argues that the
pilot-judgment procedure may also be viewed as a tool to effectively dispose of applications of more
technical issues, such as excessively lengthy judicial proceedings or the prolonged non-enforcement

of national judgments.81 In the pilot judgment Gerasimov and others v. Russia (from 2014) on the
excessive length of judicial proceedings, the Court indeed explicitly noted that as an international
human rights court, it is not appropriate for it to continuously issue repetitive judgments with basic
calculations of monetary compensation.82 Such task is better fit for domestic authorities, and therefore
the Court has presumably thought it suitable to apply the pilot-judgment procedure to such issues.
While the portion of pilot judgments addressing more ‘technical’ violations has traditionally been
predominant, it is interesting to note that pilot judgments in recent years have, instead, shifted to
concern such absolute rights as the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment,
guaranteed by article 3 of the Convention. Out of all seven pilot judgments issued since 2015, the
Court found violations of article 3 in six of them. The particular reasons for the growing number of
pilot judgments addressing rights protected by article 3 are impossible to know; the Court has
addressed other systemic problems in recent years as well, but refrained from applying the pilotjudgment procedure to those.
For example, the quasi-pilot judgment Zherebin v. Russia concerned disproportionately extensive
pre-trial detentions amounting to a violation of article 5(3) of the Convention.83 The Court recognized
some 700 similar applications pending before it, and made an assessment on the underlying systemic
nature of the problem and acknowledged it as being widespread. 84 It indicated general measures in
the reasoning of the judgment but did not apply the pilot-judgment procedure.85
The cases Riedel and others and Mečiar and others against Slovakia concerned an inadequate rentcontrol scheme in breach of article 1 of Protocol 1 on the right to peaceful enjoyment of property.86
The Court recognised some 200 applicants in a similar situation whose cases were pending before it
(although the number of applications was only 14, as some of them were submitted by groups of

individuals).87 Additionally, it had already delivered several judgments on the same issue, where it
had indicated general measures which the Slovakian government had failed to implement.88
These are just two examples of systemic problems in recent years that did not concern article 3. The
number of similar applications cannot have been the determining factor to refrain from applying the
pilot-judgment procedure; in pilot judgments concerning article 3, the numbers of pending
applications have varied extensively. There were approximately 120 similar pending applications in
Sukachov (2020), 680 in Tomov (2019), 3,200 in Rezmives (2017), and 450 in Varga (2015), but
merely 50 similar applications in W.D. (2016) and 40 in Neshkov (2015).89 It seems that the Court’s
new tendency to apply the pilot-judgment procedure to these types of cases is, at least to some extent,
motivated by something other than just concerns over its caseload.
It has become clear that the number of repetitive applications is not necessarily decisive when the
Court chooses its approach regarding a systemic problem. The following chapter will discuss other
factors that affect the Court’s choice of approach to a specific systemic problem.

3. After a Systemic Problem Has Been Identified
3.1. The Importance of State Cooperation
3.1.1. Pilot Judgments
The previous chapter recognised that the identification of a systemic problem which has given rise
(or may give rise) to an inflow of applications does not necessarily lead to a pilot judgment. This
chapter will further discuss factors which affect the decision of the Court when choosing its approach.
One major consideration it takes into account is the level of cooperation from the respondent state,
especially if the Court considers invoking the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure.90
As Rule 61(2)(a) provides, the Court must always seek the views of the parties to the case before
initiating the pilot-judgment procedure, both on the existence of a systemic problem and on the
application of the procedure.
When examining pilot judgments, it becomes apparent that states are rarely eager to have the Court
initiate the pilot-judgment procedure and instead, might even oppose its application.91 Although the
Court takes into account the level of cooperation from the side of the state, initial opposition towards
the application of the procedure does not prevent the Court from initiating it. Respondent states might
often also be cooperative, at least to some degree, even when they have first opposed the application
of the pilot-judgment procedure.92
At the early stage of the procedure, the respondent state might be reluctant to submit information on
the systemic nature of the problem.93 If that is the case, the Court admits amicus briefs from third
party interveners or relies on reports by third parties.94 The comprehensive information received by
the Court allows it to substantiate and gain credibility in its assessment on the systemic nature of the

problem. Gerards argues that this is the first step in convincing the domestic authorities of the
existence of a widespread problem that must be remedied, and a method to make an initially
uncooperative state potentially more cooperative.95
The role that cooperation plays in the selection of the approach cannot be read from case-law of the
Court. In the admissibility decision Demopoulos and others v. Turkey, the Grand Chamber remarked
that the speedy execution of judgments is “greatly assisted” in cases where the respondent state is
cooperative.96 However, in the same paragraph, it continued by stating that
Contracting States are bound, in any event, to comply with the Court’s judgments, whether or not they
have been engaged in a dialogue as to their willingness to find general solutions to a widespread problem.
The Court’s competence to undertake a pilot-judgment procedure in respect of a series of repetitive or
clone cases is not conditional on a Government’s conduct.97

In practice, the level of cooperation of the respondent state has greatly affected the Court’s decision
to apply the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure since the beginning.98 Even today, the fact that the Rules
of Court require the Court to seek the views of the parties implies that the Court does take into account
the stance of the state.
Regarding the early pilot judgments Broniowski v. Poland and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland, the Polish
Constitutional Court had already declared the relevant domestic legislation as deficient in its
judgments prior to the pilot judgments adopted by the Strasbourg Court.99 Despite judgments by the
Constitutional Court, the executive and legislative branches of the government failed to address the
problem, until the Strasbourg Court provided its support through the pilot judgments and therefore
secured cooperation between the Constitutional Court and the other branches of the Polish
government.100 Also Luzius Wildhaber, President of the Court at the time of the Broniowski judgment,
noted that the pilot-judgment procedure was particularly applicable to the Broniowski case because
of the receptiveness of the Polish government.101

The majority of judges of the Court and its Registry seem to agree with the substance of the statement
by Wildhaber: cases where the respondent state is cooperative are particularly suitable for the pilotjudgment procedure.102 Academic research has typically come to the same conclusion.103 Interviews
conducted by Kindt with members of the Registry even revealed that the level of state cooperation is
one of the most crucial factors taken into account when the Registry proposes the application of the
pilot-judgment procedure to a certain case.104
Since cooperation of the state party is crucial in the successful application of the pilot-judgment
procedure, cooperation is crucial also in the reduction of the caseload of the Court.105 Delivering
judgments on an individual basis only does not solve the underlying systemic problem, and so the
Court will have to continuously examine new applications on the matter. Furthermore, it can be
argued that applying the pilot-judgment procedure better reflects the principle of subsidiarity.106 It
shifts the responsibility of solving the underlying problem from the Court to the respondent state.107
Judge Spano has even called the era after the Interlaken Declaration ‘the age of subsidiarity’, “[…]
empowering the Member States to truly ‘bring rights home’[…]”.108 Indeed, the role of the state is at
the core of a successfully executed pilot judgment. Although the Court is the one to order general
measures, said measures include setting up a domestic remedy so that all repetitive applications can
be processed at national level.109
Interestingly, in pilot judgments, occasionally the cooperative stance extends also to the side of the
Court. The remedial measures it indicates might give leeway to the national authorities in order to be
received well on the domestic level. In Broniowski, for example, the Court recognised the “state of
the country’s finances” and stated that article 1 of Protocol 1 did not guarantee a right to full
compensation for all claimants in all circumstances.110 Thus, Gerards notes that through the pilotjudgment procedure, the Court has taken a more sympathetic and understanding approach rather than

Earlier, arguments were typically the opposite: concerns were raised that the pilot-judgment procedure excessively
encroached the freedom of the State to choose the remedial measures and did not adequately take into account the principle
of subsidiarity. The perspective has since shifted, but concerns are occasionally still raised. See also Kindt, 2018, pp. 4851.

being harsh and reprimanding.111 She argues that the success of the execution of the judgment is
determined less by the mere authority of the Court, and more by its ability to understand the situation
and persuade the state into compliance.112 Fikfak, while recognising this very same pattern in followup judgments to Ivanov v. Ukraine, instead regrets the unfavourable position for the applicants.113
Indeed, one judge admitted in her interview that such ‘award decreases’ may be due to their worries
about state compliance with the judgment.114 The practice therefore is intended to enhance execution
of the judgment, but at the expense of lower just satisfaction awards for the individual applicants in
the case.
The fact that the pilot-judgment procedure will more likely be applied to a case where the state party
is cooperative resembles more a political than judicial explanation as to why the procedure is applied
to systemic problems inconsistently. Admittedly, the pilot-judgment procedure is heavy and lengthy.
All parties involved, including the Court, are more inclined to apply it if they can expect the
respondent state to execute the judgment.115 The pilot-judgment procedure also shifts the workload
from the docket of the Court to that of national authorities, which is one reason why the Court would
want to be assured that national authorities will follow through.

3.1.2. Quasi-Pilot judgments
State cooperation is important not only in pilot judgments. When the Court indicates any type of
remedial measures, it makes an assessment to determine the type of approach that will have the most
impact.116 This entails a similar assessment as when adopting a pilot judgment. Also outside the pilotjudgment procedure, the successful execution of a judgment is most likely when the respondent state
can agree with the substance of the judgment, and remedial measures are clear and straightforward.117
However, it is not solely a matter of the state agreeing with the substance of the judgment, but even
just understanding what is required of it. The indication of remedial measures makes it easier for the
respondent state to interpret judgments of the Court and identify what is required of it to execute the
judgment.118

Judges have expressed concerns that imposing excessively prescriptive and ambitious general
measures might actually cause the state to become more hostile towards the Court.119 When the
indication of general measures is intended to assist the implementation of judgments, in such a case
the result could be the exact opposite. However, not all judges seem to agree; some judges do not find
it appropriate to be concerned of backlash, and truly enough, concerns about the resulting situation
for the victims should be more important than political considerations.120
Still, there are practical implications if the Court were to completely disregard the stance of the
respondent state; the Court is not equipped with strong enforcement mechanisms and cannot, for
example, order sanctions in cases of non-compliance.121 Selecting the most appropriate form of
measures – not necessarily the most prescriptive or ambitious – might therefore be the Court’s best
bet to ensure compliance and best possible outcome for the victim.
On the other hand, if the Court was excessively worried about the reaction of the state, many
opportunities to indicate remedial measures would have been lost. The fact that the respondent state
is uncooperative does not automatically entail non-enforcement of the judgment or hostility by the
state. Academics and judges alike have noted that in some instances where the state is already
uncooperative, it might take advantage of a vague and merely declaratory judgment to do nothing but
the bare minimum.122 An indication of general measures in the judgment is a useful point of reference
for the CM and civil society to establish whether implementation has been carried out properly, and
makes it more difficult for the state to get away with poor execution measures.123
Evidently, the importance of cooperation from the respondent state is highlighted in pilot judgments,
but even outside the ‘full’ procedure, judges are aware of the stance of the respondent state when
selecting their approach towards a systemic problem. The weight attached to the stance of the state,
however, varies even within the Court. Cooperation is not the only pragmatic consideration that plays
a part in the decision; the substance of the issue at hand, especially if it is of a complex nature, affects
the decision as well.

3.2. Significance of the Complexity of the Systemic Issue
3.2.1. No Clear Source of the Systemic Problem
Although the level of state cooperation is a major consideration for the Court to take into account, the
nature and complexity of the substantive issue at hand also affects its selection of the approach. For
example, S.Z. v. Bulgaria concerned an inadequate investigation into a case of human trafficking,
where the Court found a violation of the procedural limb of article 3 of the Convention. 124 It noted
that it had already delivered numerous judgments concerning inadequate investigations in Bulgaria,
often finding violations of the procedural limbs of articles 2 and 3.125 The Court recognised that the
problem was systemic and structural, but could not pinpoint the exact cause of the problem or the
measures needed to improve the quality of investigations, and so it did not indicate any general
measures but left the matter to be supervised by the CM.126
In their study on the Court’s remedial practice, Donald and Speck also found that judges were hesitant
to indicate remedial measures when the issue was of a complex nature.127 In an interview they
conducted, one of the judges expressed their concern about making any speculative assessments and
hence indicating general measures that would discredit the competence of the Court.128 For example,
the structural problem examined in S.Z. was of a very broad nature, namely ineffective investigations,
and from the outset, the cases did not seem to have any single ‘common denominator’ which could
have been pointed out with certainty.
When the Court applies the pilot-judgment procedure, the parties are invited to submit further
information about their views on the causes of the problem and the appropriate remedial measures;
in quasi-pilot judgments, it is unusual for extensive information on the underlying systemic problem
to be part of the parties’ pleadings.129 Hence, when issuing quasi-pilot judgments, the Court might
not be as well-equipped to indicate elaborate general measures as in ‘full’ pilot judgments. This,

however, seems somewhat like a self-fulfilling prophecy; the Court does not consider applying the
pilot-judgment procedure, so it does not ask the parties to submit their views on the underlying
systemic problem, and consequently, it does not have enough information about the problem to
indicate elaborate general measures.
Inevitably, the question arises whether issues regarding remedies should be included in the parties’
submissions routinely. It would most certainly advance the practice if both the applicant and the
respondent state had the chance to be more involved at the pre-judgment stage.130 Engaging the parties
could make the process more transparent and assert the legitimacy of the final pronouncements under
article 46 by the Court. Further, it would assist the Court in identifying the underlying problem
without having to do all the investigative work alone.

3.2.2. Complex Technicalities
In other cases, while the source of the systemic problem is clear, the details of the case and the
measures needed to remedy it are so complex that the Court refrains from indicating any prescriptive
remedial measures.
Cases under article 1 of Protocol 1 concerning, for example, rent control schemes or restitution for
expropriated property are often complex in nature, and at least one judge has explicitly stated that the
indication of elaborate remedies is not suitable in such cases.131 There have been pilot and quasi-pilot
judgments concerning such issues, but only in exceptional cases has the Court been elaborate in its
description of required general measures.132 More often, the Court has either suggested a variety of
remedies for the respondent state to choose from (such as in the quasi-pilot judgment Scordino v.
Italy) or simply stated that legislative amendments must be made or a domestic remedy instituted,
leaving the domestic authorities and the CM to work out the details.133

The complex technicalities of a case have therefore not necessarily prevented the Court from applying
the pilot-judgment procedure. Yet, in Cordella and others v. Italy, the Court refused to apply the
pilot-judgment procedure, explaining that it had no expertise regarding the technical measures needed
to clean up an area polluted by a steelwork plant.134 The case encompassed two applications lodged
by some 180 applicants, and additionally, the Court found that the pollution endangered the health of
not only the applicants, but the entire population living in the area.135
The applicants expressly requested for the pilot-judgment procedure to be invoked, since it was clear
that a great number of people were affected.136 They also asked the Court to impose general measures
to remedy the situation.137
Under article 46, the Court reiterated that the cleaning of the polluted area was essential and urgent,
and that the ‘environmental plan’ must be implemented as rapidly as possible.138 This environmental
plan for the clean-up of the area had been approved by domestic authorities already in 2012, and had
been set out to be implemented in 2014, but the implementation had been postponed until 2023.139
Hence, the Court decided to indicate general measures, emphasising the urgency of the matter, but
refraining from indicating anything prescriptive. Judges have also expressed that when seemingly
effective reforms are already underway at the domestic level, they rarely wish to interfere – but on
the other hand, instead of simply appraising the reform process, they often try to “inject urgency” into
the process.140
The Court, understandably, refrained from prescribing general measures regarding the technical issue,
a task which was better suited for domestic authorities. However, since earlier pilot judgments have
been adopted where the Court similarly did not want to pronounce itself on the specific means to
achieve a certain goal, it seems peculiar that the Court’s lack of expertise in the field of environmental
clean-up is what prevented it from applying the pilot-judgment procedure to this case.

It must be noted that the problem in Cordella was confined to a very limited area: that of just a few
municipalities whose environment was most affected by the steelwork plant.141 It is unclear whether
the Court would be willing to apply the pilot-judgment procedure to a systemic problem limited to
such a small area; as of now, it has not done so. In two earlier cases from Slovenia, Mandić and Jović
and Strucl and others, adopted on the same day in 2011, the Court did not recognise a structural
problem of overcrowding in Slovenian prisons despite arguments by the applicants.142 It stated that
“[…] the Court does not consider that it can at present conclude that there exists a structural problem
consisting of ‘a practice that is incompatible with the Convention’ nationwide […]”.143 It quoted the
Rules of Court but added the word ‘nationwide’, implying that in its view, problems that were not
nationwide could not be considered structural or systemic.
However, when an administrative practice is deficient regionally, such as in Cordella, Mandic and
Jovic, and Strucl and others, resulting in a systemic problem and capable of causing an influx of
applications, it seems unnecessary to restrict the pilot-judgment procedure only to nationwide human
rights violations. The Court provided no reason why it would be necessary to differentiate between
nationwide and regional problems. Since the intention of the pilot-judgment procedure is to
effectively dispose of repetitive applications and solve the underlying problem, such differentiation
between nationwide and regional does not seem to serve any practical purpose.

3.2.3. No Pilot Judgment Despite Extensive Information About the Systemic Problem
Typically, the Court only receives information on the systemic nature of a problem when it considers
the application of the pilot-judgment procedure, but occasionally the parties to the case submit such
information also outside the procedure. In Aslakhanova and others v. Russia, the Court “put a number
of specific questions to the parties” to better understand the scope of the issue.144 The case concerned
five applications that the Court had joined: they all complained of disappearances of their relatives,
evidence suggesting that state agents were responsible. Particularly the applicants, but also the
government, provided the Court with extensive information about the issue. The applicants also
submitted their views on the flaws and the ineffectiveness of the existing legislation, even suggesting
specific provisions of the domestic law to be amended.

The Court noted that by the time of the judgment in 2012, it had already delivered more than 120
similar judgments, and there were still similar applications pending against Russia.145 Although the
issue was clearly systemic, and the Court received extensive information on the matter, it did not
invoke the pilot-judgment procedure. In 16 paragraphs of the body of the judgment, the Court
indicated exceptionally prescriptive general measures for the respondent state to take.146
The answer as to why the pilot-judgment procedure was not applied cannot be found in the judgment;
it does not reveal whether the question was raised. Both parties to the case did provide the Court with
information about the issue, and the general measures indicated by the Court seem to be largely based
on those submissions. However, the respondent state mostly denied the existence of a systemic
problem and reassured the Court of amendments and other measures that had already been taken
regarding disappearances.147 It seems that what all pilot judgments have in common is the willingness
by the respondent state to cooperate and address the issue, at least to some degree. Perhaps that is
exactly what the case lacked.
The Court also stated that although similar applications were pending, it would not adjourn them
because of the serious and continuing nature of the issues. The adjourning of cases is a typical feature
of pilot judgments, but not a defining one. The Court has adjourned applications outside the pilotjudgment procedure, and it has also adopted pilot judgments where it did not adjourn similar
applications, especially when the case has concerned article 3, such as this one.148 Therefore the
decision not to adjourn similar applications is not necessarily what prevented the Court from applying
the pilot-judgment procedure in the case of Aslakhanova and others.
In the case of Aslakhanova and others, the Court relied on the information provided by the applicant
to indicate exceptionally prescriptive measures without invoking the pilot-judgment procedure. The
Court does not, however, always indicate general measures even when the applicant expressly makes
such a request and provides information. In the case of Abu Zubaydah v. Lithuania, the Court received
comprehensive information and explicit requests by the applicant on the measures they wished to be
taken. The Court eventually only endorsed some of the measures requested by the applicant.149 It

stated that it is not “for the Court to address to the respondent State detailed, prescriptive injunctions
of the kind requested by the applicant”, without offering further explanation.150 Such lack of
consistency and transparency considerably complicate the finding of patterns or conclusions in the
Court’s practice to apply the pilot-judgment procedure or indicate general measures under article 46.

3.3. No Indications of Remedial Measures
When the Court has identified a systemic problem, it does not always issue even a quasi-pilot
judgment. There are examples of judgments where the existence of a systemic problem seems
apparent, but the Court either does not make an assessment on the systemic nature of the problem, or,
in some cases, does identify a systemic problem but refrains from indicating general measures. This
section will further examine such examples.
In Sejdovic v. Italy, the Court identified a systemic problem concerning the lack of effective
mechanisms to secure the right of persons convicted in absentia.151 However, it refrained from
indicating general measures since the respondent state had already adopted new legislation to tackle
the problem.152 The new legislation had not yet been implemented in case-law, making it difficult to
assess its effectiveness.153
The Court adopted similar approaches in Kauczor v. Poland and two years later in Kharchenko v.
Ukraine, where it identified structural problems concerning article 5 of the Convention in both
cases.154 In each case, the Court noted the numerous similar judgments it had adopted on the issue as
well as applications that were still pending.155 In the case of Kauczor, the Court had specifically
requested the Polish government to submit its views on the structural nature of the problem, while in
Kharchenko, the Court itself described the issue as structural.156 In both cases, the Court welcomed
amendments that had been made in domestic legislation, but stated that further measures were needed

to comply with the Convention requirements.157 The judgments lack further indications of general
measures, simply stating that such measures will be required.
In Kauczor and Kharchenko, the absence of general measures is not as easily explained as in Sejdovic.
In Sejdovic, the Court stated that if the newly adopted legislation proved to be effective, no further
general measures were necessary.158 In Kauczor and Kharchenko, however, the Court acknowledged
the newly adopted legislation, but could already determine it as insufficient to address the
problems.159 Strangely, it did not elaborate on the issue, nor indicate the measures needed to achieve
compliance with article 5 of the Convention. The judgments therefore do not offer any assistance on
how to execute them, leaving it to the CM to supervise the general measures which the respondent
states would choose to adopt. The decision not to indicate general measures seems odd since the CM,
in resolution Res(2004)3, expressly invited the Court to do so whenever it identified a systemic
problem so as to assist it in the execution stage.160 The Court even acknowledged this in Kharchenko,
and yet without further explanation, decided not to indicate such measures.161
The case of Volodina v. Russia is considerably more recent.162 The applicant had suffered from
domestic violence, including severe physical abuse as well as death threats when she tried to leave
her abuser. Authorities remained passive to the situation despite the applicant’s repetitive complaints.
The Court took a gender-sensitive approach, and reiterated earlier case-law when concluding that
violence against women is a form of discrimination against women.163 The judgment cites statistical
data on domestic violence in Russia, which confirms that it mainly affects women, as well as reports
on the generally passive attitude of local authorities who often treat domestic violence as a private
issue.164 The Court briefly acknowledged this existing “large-scale structural bias”, but did not
elaborate on it further and did not come back to the issue.165 It found violations of article 3 as well as

Judge Pinto de Albuquerque issued a separate opinion where he regretted the missed opportunity to
indicate general measures under article 46.166 Indeed, in the judgment, the Court stated that the
Russian legal framework is inadequate in several important aspects; for example, domestic violence
is not defined as a separate offence and there is a threshold for the gravity of injuries required before
a public prosecution can be launched (which additionally does not take into account any other form
of abuse than the physical aspect, leaving out, for example, death threats in this case).167 The problem
is clearly systemic, and the Court even partly acknowledged this – so why did it not impose general
measures?168
As evident from the separate opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, there are disagreements even
within the Court on the suitability to indicate general measures in any given case. As for addressing
the issues in Volodina as systemic, developments might be forthcoming. Tunikova v. Russia is a group
of four pending applications that have been communicated to the Russian government. The cases
reveal that the Court has submitted questions to all parties on the existence of an underlying systemic
problem regarding “the absence of any legislation dealing with the phenomenon of domestic violence
in Russia”.169 The Court also asked whether the deficiencies would call for indications of general
measures under article 46. This signifies that the Court is prepared to indicate general measures to
address the problem – perhaps we might even acquire a pilot judgment.

3.4. The Ideal Moment to Adopt a Pilot Judgment?
The previous section discussed cases where the Court seemed aware of a systemic problem, but only
issued a declaratory judgment. This section will further discuss why pilot judgments or quasi-pilot
judgments rarely are the first responses by the Court.
There have been instances where the Court has not invoked the pilot-judgment procedure, but instead
issued a quasi-pilot judgment as a ‘warning’ to the respondent state, and even instances where the
Court was clearly aware of a systemic problem, but only issued a declaratory judgment. In an

interview conducted by Kindt, one respondent said that such an approach can be used when the Court
does not yet find it necessary to apply the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure. Similarly, in interviews
conducted by Donald and Speck, they found that judges regularly engage in discussions on the
‘optimal’ moment to move beyond mere declaratory judgments.170
Such evaluation can sometimes even be read from the judgments. In Lakatos v. Hungary, the Court
seemed to be unable to conclude whether extensively ordered pre-trial detentions in Hungary could
amount to a systemic problem. It noted that since 60 similar applications were pending before it, the
applicant’s situation was not “prompted by an isolated incident”, but right after, explained that the 60
similar applications had accumulated over quite a long time, a period of five years. 171 That, together
with on-going efforts by the Hungarian government to remedy the situation, led the Court to conclude
that a pilot judgment was not necessary at this point, but
[…] should the efforts made by the Government to tackle the underlying Convention problem prove to
be insufficient, the Court may reassess the need to apply the pilot-judgment procedure to this type of
cases […]172

Similarly, in Novruk and others v. Russia, the applicants were HIV-positive foreigners in Russia,
who, on the sole basis of their diagnosis, were denied entry, stay and/or residence in the country.173
The Court noted that measures to reform the legislation were already underway at the time of the
judgment, but that the proposed draft legislation was not adequate.174
In Novruk and others, the Court, again, must have contemplated invoking the pilot-judgment
procedure, since it is apparent that the parties to the case had been asked to submit their views on the
structural nature of the problem.175 Submissions by the respondent state reveal that it would not
welcome the application of the pilot-judgment procedure, and that in its view, no structural problem
existed.176 Although the level of state cooperation is important when the Court considers the
application of the procedure, initial opposition is not conclusive.

Indeed, the respondent state cannot have been said to be entirely disapproving, since new draft
legislation had already been proposed. The Court still deemed the proposal to be inadequate; as it
was, it only applied to foreigners who had spouses, parents or children in Russia.177 It was also unclear
whether the proposed legislation would have retroactive effect, affecting individuals such as the
applicants who had already been denied entry, stay or residence. The Court refrained from indicating
general measures, but, again, stated that if the efforts made to tackle the problem proved to be
insufficient, “[…] the Court may reassess the need to apply the pilot-judgment procedure to this type
of cases.”178
Although the Court itself stated in the judgment that it will refrain from indicating general measures,
the reasoning makes clear that general measures are required since the Court described what the
proposed draft legislation lacked.179 No pilot judgment on the issue has since been adopted, even
though execution of the case is still pending before the CM.180
Although the Court has not (yet) lived up to the ‘ultimatums’ it gave in Novruk and others or Lakatos,
there are earlier examples of quasi-pilot judgments that have later been followed by pilot judgments.
The quasi-pilot judgment Iacov Stanciu v. Romania from 2012 concerned overcrowded prisons, and
the Court indicated general measures in the reasoning of the judgment.181 Subsequently, the pilot
judgment Rezmiveş and others v. Romania concerned the same structural issue and was adopted in
2017.182 In Rezmiveş and others, the Court referred to Iacov Stanciu and the guidance it had offered,
but regretted the inadequacy of measures adopted since.183 By the time of the Rezmiveş and others
pilot judgment, there were already some 3,200 repetitive applications pending before the Court on
the issue.184 This time, it ordered general measures in imperative terms and held that the respondent
state must, within six months, submit a timetable for their implementation.185

Pilot judgments and quasi-pilot judgments are typically adopted after a number of declaratory
judgments have already been issued.186 In fact, it is rare for the Court to adopt a quasi-pilot or pilot
judgment on a newly identified problem.187 This chapter has discussed not only how the Court takes
into account the receptiveness of the state or the nature of the systemic problem, but also the ‘ideal’
moment to move beyond mere declaratory judgments. In some examples, the Court has started by
issuing declaratory judgments, then moved onto indicating general measures through a quasi-pilot
judgment, and if the problem has still persisted, escalated the matter and adopted a ‘full’ pilot
judgment. These assessments made by the Court seem to be greatly influenced by its expectation of
the most effective approach to ensure compliance by the respondent state.
The following chapter will discuss the Court’s approaches to handling repetitive applications
concerning certain systemic problems, and how the Court varies also these approaches partly
depending on its expectation of how it will affect execution.

For some recent examples, see for example Sukachov v. Ukraine (14057/17), judgment of 30 January 2020, ECtHR,

the problem for the first time, without referring to previous judgments. Cordella and others v. Italy (54414/13 and
54264/15), judgment of 24 January 2019, ECtHR, is an example of such an exception of quasi-pilot judgments.

4. The Element of Adjourning Repetitive Applications
4.1. Pilot Judgments Concerning Violations of Article 6(1) of the Convention
4.1.1. Rumpf v. Germany and Vassilios Athanasiou v. Greece: The First of Their Kind
One distinct feature of the pilot-judgment procedure is the adjourning of similar cases while
examining the one case that the Court has chosen as the pilot. It is not an exhaustive rule; there are
instances where cases have been qualified as pilot judgments, although the Court refrained from
adjourning repetitive applications. This chapter will examine such exceptions, beginning with the
earliest example Rumpf v. Germany. A comprehensive analysis of the adjournment of applications in
pilot judgments since then reveals a pattern; the Court has refrained from adjourning only in cases
either relating to article 6(1) of the Convention, or when the pilot judgment has revealed an
exceptionally urgent problem, such as violations under article 3 of the Convention. The following
sections will further analyse case-law from this perspective.
In Rumpf v. Germany, the Court continued to process similar cases to remind the respondent state on
a regular basis of the obligations resulting from the judgment.188 The systemic issue in Rumpf
concerned article 6(1) of the Convention, specifically the excessive length of judicial proceedings,
and it was the first pilot judgment where the Court did not resort to adjourning similar applications.
Although the reasoning sounds noble, at the time of adoption in 2010, the decision was questioned.189
Pilot judgments are always processed as matters of priority, not just in the case of Rumpf.190 If the
Court had indeed revealed a systemic problem, and it considered the problem to be so urgent that the
state party must be reminded of it in repetitive judgments, then why adjourn applications under the
pilot-judgment procedure in most other cases? The reasoning did not strike as consistent with the
spirit of all earlier pilot judgments, implying that in some cases the respondent state must be reminded
regularly through new judgments, while in others not.
Since the judgment is from 2010, the pilot-judgment procedure had not yet been codified in the Rules
of Court. Since 2011, Rule 61(6)(a) has provided that repetitive applications may be adjourned “as

appropriate”. Therefore, the question has been clarified and the Court is not obliged to adjourn
applications in ‘full’ pilot judgments.
Still, chapter 2 recognised the adjourning of similar cases as one of the features that makes the pilotjudgment procedure so effective in reducing the backlog caused by repetitive applications. The Court
has never applied the pilot-judgment procedure unless similar applications have already been lodged,
although neither the Rules of Court nor Resolution Res2004(3) require it. Perhaps it doesn’t want to
depart from one of the initial intentions of the pilot-judgment procedure, namely relieving its
workload resulting from systemic problems.
Not adjourning repetitive applications undermines these arguments. So, the Court chooses to apply
the pilot-judgment procedure, but not to relieve the burden of its caseload. If relieving its caseload is
not essential, then, moreover, the Court could apply the pilot-judgment procedure in cases where no
similar applications exist yet, but it has identified a systemic problem.
Regarding the case of Rumpf, Gerards suggests that the Court seems to take different approaches
concerning the adjournment of similar applications based on what it expects will be the most effective
instrument to put pressure on the respondent state.191 Indeed, as noted, the Court wanted to remind
the respondent state on a regular basis of its obligations; perhaps, in the case of Rumpf, the Court
believed that the continued processing of pending applications would be the most effective means to
put pressure on the state into executing the judgment. Gerards also goes on to suggest that the number
of pending applications might affect whether the Court will adjourn similar applications. 192 In the
case of Rumpf, the number of similar applications pending was some 55, which is admittedly not a
significant increase in the workload of the Court.193
The pilot judgment Vassilios Athanasiou and others v. Greece was adopted just a few months later
the same year.194 Interestingly, the Court did not adjourn similar applications in that case either. The
case also concerned the excessive length of domestic judicial proceedings, and the Court explained
that it wanted to avoid a situation where applicants who already suffered from excessively lengthy
proceedings would have to have their case put on hold once again. 195 The concerns raised by the

Court in Vassilios Athanasiou related therefore to arguments also put forward by numerous authors:
the pilot-judgment procedure raises issues regarding individuals’ access to justice.196 Since the case
of Rumpf was another excessive length of proceedings case, the Court might have had similar reasons
not to adjourn repetitive applications at the time, although no expression of such is found in the
judgment.
In Vassilios Athanasiou, the number of repetitive applications pending before the Court was
approximately 200. Since the Court was concerned about the proceedings eventually only becoming
lengthier if it adjourned all repetitive cases, one might conclude that it would continue the
examination of repetitive applications in all pilot judgments concerning the excessive length of
proceedings. Indeed, two pilot judgments concerning the excessive length of proceedings against
Bulgaria were adopted the following year, in 2011, on the same day; Finger and Dimitrov and
Hamanov.197 The Court decided to continue processing all repetitive applications in the usual manner,
although it already recognised approximately 500 and 200 of them in each case, respectively.198 Since
then, however, it seems that the Court has continued to take the issue into account, but the approaches
have somewhat varied. Different variations will be discussed below.

4.1.2. Adjourning Part of the Repetitive Applications
Ümmühan Kaplan v. Turkey is an example of a pilot judgment in which the Court continued the
examination only of those applications that had already been communicated to the respondent state.199
As Gerards notes, the burden that the examination of all repetitive cases imposes on the Court might
affect its decision on the adjournment of them, and indeed, in this case the Court recognised a total
of approximately 2,700 repetitive applications pending.200 Examining them all separately would
certainly have required an immense effort. Of the 2,700 applications, just over 300 had been
communicated to the government, allowing the Court to adjourn 2,373 applications.201 The approach
seems to strike a balance between two competing interests. It allowed the adjudication of those

applications that were already being processed, not delaying their proceedings any further. It also
relieved a significant part of the burden that the systemic problem imposed on the Court.
The Court drew attention to the fact that a new remedy regarding the issue had already been
introduced in Turkey, which was a welcomed development to address the systemic problem.202 The
sheer number of applications was therefore seemingly not the only reason to adjourn them. Since
Turkey had already introduced a new remedy to address the problem, the Court had reason to believe
in the respondent state’s capability of offering redress to the applicants. After the judgment, further
remedies were introduced in Turkey, and in two separate inadmissibility decisions of 2013, the Court
accepted the new remedies as effective.203 The CM has since closed its supervision of the judgment,
declaring it executed.204
Later the same year, the Court took a similar approach in the pilot judgment Manushaqe Puto and
others v. Albania concerning the systemic problem of prolonged non-enforcement of national
judgments.205 The judgment reveals that the applicants expressly requested that the Court continue
the processing of those applications that had been communicated to the government.206 The Court not
only continued to process the communicated applications, but all applications lodged before the
delivery of the judgment.207 It only adjourned potential new applications for a period of 18 months,
expecting the government to implement remedial measures within that time limit. 208 In Gazsó v.
Hungary, adopted in 2015, the Court similarly adjourned all potential new applications, but continued
to process the pending applications in a usual manner.209

4.1.3. Continuing the Communication of Applications
In 2009, the Court adopted three pilot judgments concerning the prolonged non-enforcement of
domestic judgments: Olaru and others v. Moldova, Burdov v. Russia (no. 2) and Yuriy Nikolayevich

Ivanov v. Ukraine. The Court found violations of articles 6(1) and 13 of the Convention in each
case.210
The problem with non-enforcement of judgments resembles that of excessive length of proceedings;
when a domestic court judgment is not enforced, the individual is similarly left to await the fulfilment
of justice. In the Olaru and others case, the Court expressly stated that
[…] it would be unfair if the applicants in such cases, who have allegedly been suffering continuing
violations of their right to a court for years and have sought relief in this Court, were compelled yet again
to resubmit their grievances to the domestic authorities, be it on the grounds of a new remedy or
otherwise.211

The Court argued that one of the aims of the pilot-judgment procedure was to allow speedy redress
at the domestic level to the large numbers of people affected by the structural problem.212 It therefore
not only drew attention to the burden of its own caseload, but also to the rights of the individual
applicants and their interests. It adjourned the adjudication of repetitive applications, but continued
to communicate them to the respondent state. By communicating all applications concerning the issue
and letting the government process them instead of the Court, the result could, in the best case, be
favourable both to the applicants and the Court. The applicants would be afforded redress, and the
Court would not have to deliver separate judgments for each of them.
In each case, the Court relied on the respondent states to execute the measures it indicated in the pilot
judgment, and decided to adjourn the adjudication of all repetitive applications, only communicating
them to the respondent state.213 Proceedings concerning potential new applications were to be
adjourned in their entirety.214

In the cases of Burdov and Olaru and others, the approach yielded results, even though it was a slow
and not entirely efficient process. The Russian and Moldovan governments introduced new remedies
within the time limits set by the Court.215
At first, however, the new remedies in Russia proved to be insufficient; the Court adopted another
pilot judgment on the same issue in 2014, Gerasimov and others.216 The Court continuously referred
to Burdov (no. 2), and, while recognising the developments that had taken place, indicated how the
new remedies were not sufficiently comprehensive, for example not encompassing the situations of
the applicants in Gerasimov and others.217 Regarding the adjournment of repetitive applications, it
took an identical approach to that of Burdov – the positive developments experienced as a response
to the judgment seem to have influenced this decision.218
Unfortunately, Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v. Ukraine, however, is arguably the worst example of nonexecution of a pilot judgment.219 The Ukrainian government failed to execute the general measures
within the one-year time limit it had been afforded, and requested for an extension of the time limit,
which the Court granted.220 The Court denied the government’s second request for an extension, and
in 2012, resumed the examination of some 2,000 applications that had initially been adjourned.221
In his article, Zsolt Bobis notes that the pilot judgment in Ümmühan Kaplan (discussed above) was
adopted just three weeks after the Court was obliged to resume the examination of the adjourned
applications in Ivanov.222 He argues that the new approach – to continue processing the applications
already communicated to the government but adjourn the rest – could have been influenced by the
shortcomings experienced in Ivanov.223 By choosing to continue processing only the communicated

The Court noted the remedies introduced by Russia in Gerasimov and others (29920/05 et al.), judgment of 1 July

applications in Ümmühan Kaplan, the Court could significantly ease its caseload (by almost 2,400
applications), while at the same time constantly pressuring the respondent state into compliance by
continuing to process and adopt judgments on the remaining 330 cases that had already been
communicated. It also better balanced the situation for the applicants, since the pilot judgment in
Ümmühan Kaplan did not entail further delays for the applicants of the communicated cases – unlike
in Ivanov, where the adjournment eventually only led to longer delays for all applicants.224
However, the continued adjudication of applications in Ivanov might in any event have resulted in
the same outcome. The continued communication of the cases to the Ukrainian government was
possibly meant to pressure the state into compliance in the same way that the continued adjudication
of cases would have done.225 Considering the extensive difficulties of execution of the Ivanov
judgment, and the overall failure by the Ukrainian government to address the widespread problem of
non-execution of national judgments, it is difficult to say whether any approach adopted by the Court
could have effectively pressured the government into compliance.226 The previous chapter discussed
the role of state cooperation regarding the application of the pilot-judgment procedure, and indeed, it
might well be that lessons learned from Ivanov have contributed to the Court’s caution in the field.
Although the approach proved to be unsuccessful in the case of Ivanov, the Court has utilised it again
later. In two pilot judgments against Greece in 2012, the Court adjourned the adjudication of all
repetitive applications, only communicating them to the government. 227 The Court drew attention to
the pilot judgment Vassilios Athanasiou, also against Greece (discussed above), but found it
unnecessary to continue the processing of applications as it had in that case, even though the number
of pending applications was smaller in these latter pilot judgments combined.228 The Court even
reasoned that it was exactly because of the smaller number of applications that their adjournment was
appropriate – an argument that seems a bit peculiar.229 However, following the judgment in Vassilios

Athanasiou, the Court noted that new measures had been implemented in Greece. Perhaps the smaller
number of applications meant instead that the Court was confident that they would be relatively easily
dealt with at the domestic level, since Greece had already earlier shown its responsiveness towards
the problem.230
In the pilot judgment Rutkowski and others v. Poland from 2015, also concerning the excessive length
of proceedings, the Court again emphasised the flexibility allowed by the pilot-judgment procedure,
deciding, again, to only communicate applications while adjourning their adjudication.231 The HudocExec database reveals that in 2017, when the two-year time limit was running out, the Court was able
to strike out some 400 repetitive cases following the Rutkowski judgment, where a solution had been
found on the domestic level for the individual applicants to the case.232 However, as of January 2021,
the case was still pending execution, since the underlying systemic problem resulting in the
continuing ineffectiveness of the judicial system persisted in Poland.233
The previous sections have explored the approaches regarding adjournment of repetitive applications
in pilot judgments concerning the excessive length of judicial proceedings or the non-enforcement of
national judgments. The approaches have varied extensively; in some of the cases, even if the Court
did not adjudicate them, they were communicated to the respondent state to encourage speedy redress
at the domestic level. In others, the Court continued to process repetitive applications, either all or in
part. The number of repetitive applications appears to influence the decision regarding the approach
to take; where there have been large numbers of applications, the Court has been reluctant to process
them all in a regular manner. In fact, the Court has not continued the processing of all applications in
any excessive length of proceedings pilot judgment since 2011 – in the more recent cases, it has
instead always opted for other ‘hybrid’ approaches, but never adjourning all proceedings in their
entirety. For a visualised overview over the adjournment of applications in all pilot judgments
concerning either the excessive length of judicial proceedings or the non-enforcement of domestic
judicial decisions, see Annex I.

Continuing to adopt judgments or continuing to communicate applications to the respondent state are
useful tools to put pressure on the state. It also serves the interests of the applicants; their grievances
are not put on hold again, after already having suffered excessively lengthy proceedings. When a
systemic problem has concerned a violation of article 3, or another matter of exceptional urgency, the
Court has in general adopted a similar approach, taking into account the vulnerable situation of the
applicants and hence continuing to process all applications. The following section will examine such
cases in more detail.

4.2. Pilot Judgments Concerning Urgent Situations
Ananyev and others v. Russia, the first pilot judgment concerning a violation of the prohibition of
inhuman or degrading treatment, was adopted in 2012, that is, after the pilot-judgment procedure was
incorporated into the Rules of Court.234 The Court refrained from adjourning similar applications,
drawing attention to Rule 61(6) of the Rules of Court, which indeed provides that the examination of
all similar applications may be adjourned “as appropriate”.235 The Ananyev and others case concerned
overcrowded cells in remand prisons, and the Court found violations of articles 3 and 13.236 It
identified the urgency and importance of complaints concerning inhuman and degrading treatment,
and therefore chose to continue processing applications complaining of the same issue.237
The Court has later applied the same reasoning in other pilot judgments concerning inhuman or
degrading treatment in detention. It did not adjourn repetitive applications in the pilot judgments
Varga and others v. Hungary (2015), Neshkov and others v. Bulgaria (2015), or Sukachov v. Ukraine
(2020), referring to Ananyev in each case.238 The Court has not been thoroughly consistent in this
practice – in the pilot judgment Rezmives and others v. Romania, the Court also found a violation of
article 3 regarding conditions of detention, and although it continued to process all communicated
applications, it adjourned those that had not yet been communicated to the state.239

234

In the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (17885/04) and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (17599/05), judgments of 22 October
2009, the Court identified the overcrowding of Polish detention facilities to be systemic and widespread, but general
measures were only indicated in the reasoning of the judgment and similar applications were not adjourned, and so, for
the purposes of this study, they are not considered full pilot judgments.

Similarly, in the case of M.C. and others v. Italy, the Court continued to process all communicated
applications.240 The applicants had accidentally been infected with either HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis
C following a blood transfusion or the administration of blood derivatives.241 They all received
compensation for the permanent damage sustained, but in 2010, a legislative decree that resulted in
the drastic reduction of the amount of compensation was adopted in Italy. 242 Even though the Italian
Constitutional Court held that the relevant provisions of the legislative decree were unconstitutional,
the applicants’ situations were not reassessed.243
The Court found violations of article 6(1) and article 1 of Protocol 1, since the legislative decree
pursued only the state’s financial interests, had specifically denied the applicants reassessment of
their compensation, and had denied the applicants compensation which they had earlier obtained
through final domestic judgments.244 The Court also found a violation of article 14 taken in
conjunction with article 1 of Protocol 1.245
The case did not concern ‘core rights’ (articles 2, 3, 4, or 5(1) of the Convention) as the other
judgments under this section did, but the urgency of the situation was apparent. Many of the
applicants’ health deteriorated during the proceedings due to the infections, and one applicant
suffered from nervous breakdowns and attempted suicide several times.246 Six of the applicants died
before the judgment was delivered.247 The decision to continue the processing of all communicated
cases was consistent with earlier practice, taking into account the vulnerable and urgent situation of
the applicants.248
In the pilot judgment W.D. v. Belgium from 2016, the Court found violations of both article 3 and 5
concerning the lack of appropriate treatment of prisoners with mental disorders. 249 Still, the Court
decided to adjourn all similar applications for two years, giving the respondent state time to remedy
the situation. The Court took a similar approach in Tomov and others v. Russia in 2019, where it
recognised that the substantive issue was similar to that of Ananyev from six years earlier but

adjourned all repetitive applications nonetheless.250 The judgments offer no explanation why the
Court decided to adjourn the applications – it is certainly a deviation from all previous practice in
pilot judgments concerning ‘core rights’.
In the judgment Torreggiani v. Italy, concerning overcrowded prisons which the Court found to
amount to a violation of article 3, all similar applications not yet communicated to the respondent
state were adjourned.251 In an interview conducted by Kindt, one respondent from the Court said that
the Italian government had already taken steps to remedy the situation, and so the applicants would
find redress quicker at the national level than if the Court had examined the cases separately. 252 The
respondent also stated that the Registry of the Court simply would not have had enough Italian
lawyers to be able to effectively examine all repetitive applications.253 Such information cannot be
found in judgments, meaning that one cannot know for certain whether similar factors played a part
in the cases of W.D. and Tomov.
Based on interviews conducted by Kindt, it seems that there is disagreement within the Court on the
suitability to adjourn cases when the violations concern article 3 of the Convention. One interviewee
was of the view that in cases where the applicants are still in the violating conditions, the case cannot
be bargained, while another stated that the adjournment or non-adjournment is not determined by the
underlying issue.254 If, however, the substance of the violation is not decisive, it seems odd that the
only pilot judgments where the Court refrained from adjourning repetitive applications all concern
either problems arising from urgent situations or issues of excessively lengthy proceedings or nonenforcement. If, on the other hand, cases under article 3 “cannot be bargained” when the applicants
are still in the violating conditions, applications should not have been adjourned in the case of W.D.,
where the applicants were still in the violating conditions (in Tomov, the applicants themselves were
not in the violating conditions anymore, but the systemic problem still persisted).255 Such
disagreements within the Court result in an inconsistent practice that lacks transparency. For a
visualised overview over the treatment of repetitive applications in all pilot judgments concerning
‘urgent’ issues, see Annex II.

4.3. Adjourning Repetitive Applications Outside the Pilot-Judgment Procedure
Clearly, the adjournment of similar cases is not what makes a pilot judgment a pilot judgment. The
previous sections discussed pilot judgments where the Court refrained from adjourning repetitive
applications. The case-law is further complicated when examining quasi-pilot judgments: In XenidesArestis v. Turkey from 2005 and Zorica Jovanovic v. Serbia from 2013, the Court never explicitly
invoked the pilot-judgment procedure but adjourned similar cases nonetheless.
After Turkish military forces had occupied Cyprus in 1974, Mrs Xenides-Arestis had been forced to
abandon her home. Turkey failed to provide any sort of compensation for the continuing occupation
of her home, leading the Court to find violations of article 8 and article 1 of Protocol 1. The Court
ordered the respondent state to remedy the situation, not only in respect of the applicant but also in
respect of all similar applications pending before the Court.256 The measures were imposed in the
operative part of the judgment, which would be typical for pilot judgments. The Court even set a time
frame; the remedy for everyone affected should be available within three months from the judgment,
and redress should be ordered within three months after that.257
The Court noted that there were approximately 1,400 similar applications pending before it, and
decided to adjourn them pending the implementation of the general measures indicated in the
judgment.258
It is, admittedly, difficult to classify whether the pilot-judgment procedure was applied in XenidesArestis, since it does have almost all elements of a pilot judgment; a widespread systemic problem, a
large number of similar pending applications, and the Court adjourning all similar applications as
well as imposing general measures in the operative part of the judgment.
In his study, Leach considers Xenides-Arestis to be a quasi-pilot judgment, not only because the pilotjudgment procedure was never expressly applied, but also because the Turkish government never
accepted any responsibility for any violation of the Convention.259 What all ‘full’ pilot judgments

seem to have in common is some level of cooperation from the side of the state party.260 In its Annual
Report of 2005, the Court itself recognised that “although the [Xenides-Arestis] judgment is not a
‘pilot judgment’ in the strict sense, it forms part of a group of judgments in which the Court has
significantly developed its role in relation to the execution of judgments.”261 So, at the time when the
judgment was adopted, it was certainly not categorised as a pilot judgment. Interestingly, in the
admissibility decision Demopoulos and others v. Turkey from 2010, the Court itself, the Turkish
government and the applicants continuously refer to the Xenides-Arestis case as a pilot.262 Perhaps
the judgment was later marked a pilot, but since there seems to be no public information about it, it
is impossible to know. Information within the Court seems limited as well, since Judge Sicilianos, as
late as in 2014, referred to Xenides-Arestis as a quasi-pilot.263
Since Xenides-Arestis is from 2005, the pilot-judgment procedure was relatively new and had not yet
been codified in the Rules of Court. A more recent example of a case with similar elements is Zorica
Jovanovic v. Serbia from 2013.264
The case concerned the fate of the applicant’s new-born son, who had allegedly deceased in the
maternity ward at the hospital in 1983. The applicant and her family were never let to see the body
and were not informed where he was buried, leading her to suspect that he had, in fact, not died but
been abducted. The authorities failed to provide any credible explanation and refused to investigate
the issue further. In the early 2000’s, Serbian media began reporting of numerous similar cases.
The Court found a violation of the applicants’ right to respect for family life under article 8 of the
Convention, and ordered in the operative provisions of the judgment the respondent state to secure a
mechanism to provide individual redress not only to the applicant, but to all parents in a similar
situation.265 The mechanism was to be instituted within one year from the date when the judgment
became final. The Court also adjourned all similar pending applications for one year, presumably so
that the respondent state would be given a chance to execute the general measures within the time
limit.266

In Zorica Jovanovic, the existence of a systemic problem was never established by the Court.267 In
Xenides-Arestis, the Court at least explicitly identified “[…] a widespread problem affecting large
numbers of people […]”.268
In the Zorica Jovanovic judgment, references are made to various reports concerning the issue of
‘missing babies’ in Serbia.269 For example, a parliamentary report from 2006 stated that “hundreds”
of parents in similar situations had applied to the Serbian Parliament to ask for redress.270 The reports
are cited in the judgment, but without any assessments or comments by the Court.
The acts complained of happened between the years 1970 and 2000, before Serbia ratified the
Convention (in 2004), so the Court understandably did not find it relevant to examine the lawfulness
of the practice at the time; it could not have found a violation on this matter in any case, since it did
not have jurisdiction ratione temporis.271 Instead, it focused on the ongoing nature of the violation,
namely that the applicant still had no possibility of redress.
The Court did observe that the respondent state’s response had still been inadequate between 2006
and 2010, when some efforts had been made to offer redress, but eventually no amendments to
existing legislation were made. It also observed that there was “a significant number of potential
applicants”.272 Yet, the Court made no further assessment to establish the existence of a systemic
problem.273
The judgment does not reveal whether the parties to the case were asked to submit any information
on the issue.274 The Court also did not provide any estimation about the number of people affected,
or the number of repetitive pending applications, which it usually does in pilot judgments.
Considering that the Court adjourned all repetitive applications, the case of Zorica Jovanovic cannot
have been the only one.

267

Such an assessment is inherent in pilot judgments, as provided for by Rule 61(1) of the Rules of Court.

Many elements in the Zorica Jovanovic judgment indicate the application of the pilot-judgment
procedure, especially the adjourning of repetitive pending applications and ordering general measures
in the operative provisions of the judgment. However, it seems to lack one of the most essential
elements: the identification by the Court of a systemic problem and the underlying cause to that
problem. Moreover, in its Annual Report from 2013, the Committee of Ministers did not list the
Zorica Jovanovic case under pilot judgments, but instead under “[j]udgments with indications of
relevance for the execution (under Article 46)”.275
This chapter has discussed the practice of adjourning repetitive applications as a mechanism to
respond to systemic problems, and especially with a focus on exceptions to that approach. Usually,
repetitive applications are adjourned in pilot judgments to make the procedure more efficient for the
Court and grant redress to the applicants at the domestic level rather than through numerous separate
judgments by the Court. Exceptions to the general rule have been made in pilot judgments raising
issues of excessively lengthy judicial proceedings and prolonged non-enforcement of domestic
judgments (so as not to put the applicants’ complaints on hold yet again), as well as in cases that raise
exceptionally urgent issues. Still, even under these categories of pilot judgments, the case-law has
proven to be complex.
What is even more surprising are the two examples in the case-law of the Court where it adjourned
repetitive applications without applying the pilot-judgment procedure. There is no explicit basis for
doing so, since the Rules of Court only provide for the adjournment of applications under the pilotjudgment procedure. Besides, the exceptions are so rare that they might be regarded as deviations
from established case-law rather than precedents. Nonetheless, they have added even more
complexity to an already complex practice.

5. The Court’s Role in the Execution of Pilot and Quasi-Pilot Judgments: A Closer Look
5.1. Competence of the Court to Indicate or Impose Remedial Measures
Article 46(1) of the Convention, which the Court relies on when it indicates remedial measures,
simply reads that “[t]he High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the
Court in any case to which they are parties.” It does not explicitly confer any power to the Court
regarding the indication of remedial measures. Article 46(2) only goes on to provide that “[t]he final
judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its
execution”, thus creating a division between the competence of the Court vis-à-vis the CM.
The vast majority of the Court’s judgments include no indications of remedial measures for the state,
but are instead declaratory in nature. The absence of such indications in a judgment does, however,
not imply that merely the payment of damages would suffice to execute the judgment. The Court has
repeatedly held that in addition to paying just satisfaction, the respondent state must choose, under
the supervision of the CM, the appropriate remedial measures to put an end to the violation.276
Simply paying just satisfaction is inadequate, because when the Court has found a breach of the
Convention, it imposes on the respondent state a legal obligation to “[…] restore as far as possible
the situation existing before the breach”.277 If such restoration is in practice impossible, the state must
choose the means of remedy that are most compatible with the conclusions of the judgment.278
Therefore, when the Court orders remedial measures, it does not impose any new obligations on the
state, but instead, simply clarifies already existing obligations.279
The declaratory nature of judgments has traditionally been thought to reflect the subsidiarity
principle; the state must achieve a specific result, but the Court does not dictate the means by which
to do so.280 Additionally, the declaratory nature of judgments was viewed as essential to reflect the
division of powers between the Court and the CM.281 Against this background it is easier to

277

52

understand why the issuing of judgments containing individual or general measures raised plenty of
critical voices when the practice first started.282 Such voices have since subsided, and the competence
of the Court to indicate remedial measures also outside the explicit pilot-judgment procedure is
broadly accepted in legal doctrine today.283 This shift in perspective is supported by the generally
welcoming attitude of state parties, who find remedial indications helpful so as to execute sufficiently
without going overboard.284 Even within reluctant states, there are also conscientious domestic actors
who find financial or technical excuses for non-compliance frustrating; if the Court then spells out
what it would like to see, such excuses are more difficult to maintain.285
Similarly, the Execution Department of the Court seems to encourage judges to indicate as clearly as
possible the desired remedies in the judgment since it “simply helps them in their work”.286 However,
neither the Execution Department nor the CM will advise the Court in a specific case at the judgment
stage.287 Such interference at the judgment stage, especially by a political body such as the CM, could
jeopardise the Court’s judicial independence.
However, as recently as in 2017, Judge Raimondi, joined by six other judges, stated that “the Court
is invested with no competence, of any kind, in the field of the execution of judgments”.288 Befittingly
described by Donald and Speck as a “throwback to the traditionalist view of the Court’s role”, the
statement is quite misleading.289 Case-law under article 46 today, including pilot judgments, has
grown remarkably. In such judgments the Court is certainly involved in the field of execution, since
it indicates measures to the respondent state regarding the execution of the judgment.290 The following
sections will further examine the evolving role of the Court in the field of execution.

282

For some examples, see the partly dissenting opinion of Judge Zagrebelsky in Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (35014/97),
judgment of 19 June 2006 [GC], ECtHR, Sicilianos, 2014, pp. 249-252, Fyrnys, 2011, and Yildiz, 2015.
283
To put it shortly, confidence in the Court’s competence to interpret the Convention (including article 46) has grown
since. For some thorough analyses, see for example Sicilianos, 2014, pp. 253-257, Donald and Speck, 2017, pp. 101-102,
and Jahn, 2014 (on individual remedial measures).
284
Villiger, 2015, p. 36. For example, in Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland (26374/18), judgment of 1 December
2020, the Court stated that general measures must be implemented to prevent similar violations, but that being said, the
state was not obliged to reopen all previous similar cases (para. 314).

5.2. Imposing Remedial Measures in the Operative Provisions
Neither the Convention nor the Rules of Court contain any specifications regarding statements which
should be reserved for the operative provisions, other than Rule 61(3) concerning the pilot-judgment
procedure.291 According to the Court’s Practice Direction on just satisfaction claims, it is only in
“extremely rare” cases that the Court can impose consequential orders in the operative provisions to
remedy a violation.292 It applies to both individual and general measures.
Typically, the Court only imposes remedial measures outside the pilot-judgment procedure when
there is but one form of action to take to end or redress the violation. Cremer therefore argues that
here, again, the Court does not impose any new obligations on the respondent state, and similarly,
does not encroach on the competence of the CM, since presumably, the CM would have had to point
out the exact same measures.293
In the ‘infant’ years of the pilot-judgment procedure, the Court did in some quasi-pilot judgments
order general measures in the operative provisions of the judgment.294 Since 2013, the Court has been
increasingly wary of ordering general measures in the operative provisions of the judgment, and has
ordered specific general measures in pilot judgments only.295 Perhaps this development is a response
to the calls for consistency in the application of the pilot-judgment procedure and the difficulties to
distinguish between pilot judgments and quasi-pilot judgments.296 Be that as it may, the development
291

Rule 61(3) provides that “[t]he Court shall in its pilot judgment identify both the nature of the structural or systemic
problem or other dysfunction as established as well as the type of remedial measures which the Contracting
Party concerned is required to take at the domestic level by virtue of the operative provisions of the
judgment”.

295
Donald and Speck, 2017, p. 91 (statistics 2013-2016). By examining judgments identified as “having indications of
relevance for the execution” in the Annual Reports of the CM published since then, 2017-2020, as well as filtering the
HUDOC database for Article 46 judgments in the past 12 months, one can conclude that specific general measures have
been provided in the operative provisions in pilot judgments only. The last quasi-pilot judgment with specific imperative
general measures in the operative provisions was Zorica Jovanovic v. Serbia (21794/08), judgment of 26 March 2013,
ECtHR. In the quasi-pilot judgments McCaughey and others v. the United Kingdom (43098/09), judgment of 16 July
2013, ECtHR, and Ali Riza and others v. Turkey (30226/10 and 5506/16), judgment of 28 January 2020, ECtHR, the
Court did impose a general obligation to remedy the systemic problem in the operative provisions, which is regrettably
an exceptional inconsistency. However, since Rule 61(3) on the pilot-judgment procedure provides that the type of general
measures must be imposed in the operative provisions, these two cases can still be clearly distinguished from ‘full’ pilot
judgments.
296
Even the Ministerial Conference at Interlaken drew attention to the problem in 2010, stressing “[…] the need for the
Court to develop clear and predictable standards for the ‘pilot judgment’ procedure as regards selection of applications,
the procedure to be followed and the treatment of adjourned cases, and to evaluate the effects of applying such and similar

54

is certainly welcomed as it has clarified the differentiation between pilot judgments and quasi-pilot
judgments.
In pilot judgments, the type of general measures which will be required are always imposed in the
operative provisions.297 More and more frequently however, the Court only imposes on the state an
obligation to make available a domestic remedy or remedies – either compensatory, preventive, or
both.298 The obligation remains quite general, without specifying the content or details of said
remedy.299
More thorough assessments and elaborations on the measures to introduce are found in the reasoning
of pilot judgments.300 By doing so, the Court signals that general measures beyond the payment of
just satisfaction are imperative, but the choice of such measures is left to the respondent state. In the
reasoning of the judgment, the respondent state can find guidance on the type of measures to choose
from, without being bound by one. This creates an ‘obligation of result’ in the operative provisions –
to introduce a domestic remedy or remedies – but does not dictate imperatively the means to achieve
it.301 The Court performs a balancing act between its own competences, those of the state, and those
of the CM; a primary example of taking the principle of subsidiarity into consideration.302
In addition to imposing general measures, the Court may set a time frame for the measures in question
to be adopted.303 Such time frames are included in the operative provisions as well, making them
legally binding, and signifying that the Court is further reaching into the sphere of supervising the
execution of judgments.304 On the one hand, the Court foresees and sets the groundwork for the
execution process. On the other hand, time frames might be viewed as a tool for the Court itself to set

a deadline when it is appropriate for it to review the repetitive cases and check up on the domestic
situation.305
The CM, as a political body, is reluctant to set deadlines that must be met by the respondent state,
and hence, execution processes might become lengthy.306 If a time frame is determined by the Court
in imperative terms, the execution process will typically be facilitated. Especially in lengthy, drawnout situations a fixed time limit can be helpful.307 Still, it is not without risk; the Court is not as
experienced as the CM in matters of execution and might unknowingly expect results beyond reach
of the domestic authorities. Such drawbacks could be foreseen by allowing the parties to comment
beforehand on not only the remedies, but also the time frame envisaged by the Court.308
Recently, the Court has in several cases taken a more cautious and perhaps complementary approach
by requiring an action plan to be produced in cooperation with the CM within a binding time frame.309
In such cases, the Court does not call for the substantive problem to be remedied within a certain time
frame, but simply that the State must have a plan concerning the steps it will take to solve the problem
within the specified time. Although this approach would seem to catch the optimal balance of powers,
it was for some reason not applied in the two most recent pilot judgments from 2019 and 2020.310
5.3. Indicating Remedial Measures in the Reasoning of the Judgment
In general, remedial measures in the reasoning of the judgment are not considered legally binding,
while remedial measures in the operative provisions of the judgment have binding force.311 The Court
has held that concerning judgments where it has merely indicated individual or general remedial
measures, ultimately, the choice of measures to implement remains with the respondent state, under

ordered domestic remedies to be made available within eighteen months.

the European Court of Human Rights” – report, p. 3, and Judge Serghides in para. 73 of his partly dissenting opinion in
Khlaifia and others v. Italy (16483/12), all consider remedial measures in the reasoning only as simply non-binding

the supervision of the CM.312 It further held that such flexibility is necessary, taking into account,
inter alia, the applicant’s evolving situation.313 Nevertheless, execution measures eventually adopted
by the respondent state must be compatible with the “conclusions and spirit” of the Court’s
judgment.314
However, judges of the Court do not entirely agree on the legal nature of remedial measures appearing
only in the reasoning of the judgment. Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) is a so-called “followup” to the earlier case Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal, where the applicant had been convicted without
being heard in person, resulting in a violation of article 6(1).315 The Court had reiterated the Öcalan
clause in the reasoning of the judgment by stating that “a retrial or a reopening of the case, if
requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation”.316
The respondent state did not, however, follow the recommendation and instead, refused to reopen the
proceedings, and so the applicant lodged the follow-up.317 In the follow-up, the Grand Chamber
concluded, by a majority vote of 9-8, that the refusal to reopen proceedings could not constitute a
violation, since in the view of the majority, the Court had no jurisdiction to order the reopening of
proceedings.318
Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, joined by Judges Karakaş, Sajó, Lazarova Trajkovska, Tsotsoria,
Vehabović, and Kūris expressed in a dissenting opinion to Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) that
remedial measures in the reasoning part of the judgment have the same legal force as those in the
operative provisions, and hence, the Court should have again found a violation.319 The statement
contradicts views of other judges within the Court as well as most academics.320

In a more nuanced way, Judge Kūris explains how, in this particular case, a retrial would have been
the only true redress of the violation.321 This is, perhaps, a better suited argument in this case; the
Court could have found a violation again in Moreira Ferreira (no. 2), not because the respondent
state had failed to implement a measure merely indicated in the reasoning, but because it was the only
measure that would have truly restored the situation.322 Judge Kūris goes on to state that the message
of the first Moreira Ferreira judgment was “Very, very clear”, but that in hindsight, it might have
been more appropriate to impose the remedial measure in the operative provisions.323
In conclusion, it is difficult to find support to the statement of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque that
remedial measures in the reasoning part of the judgment have the same legal force as those in the
operative part; generally, the reasoning is regarded as obiter dicta and therefore not legally binding.
However, in some cases, such as in Moreira Ferreira, the finding of a violation leaves no real choice
as to the measures required to remedy it, and the absence of an explicit order to implement the specific
measure should not discharge the state of its obligation.
Indeed, general measure indications in the judgment are better described as guidance for the execution
stage, instead of imperative orders. The state cannot excuse non-execution by claiming that it does
not know what is expected of it if the Court has thoroughly clarified certain general measures.324 They
are still just that; clarifications that cannot be enforced, but instead are meant to be persuasive.
However, such indications vary in form and in some judgments, the Court merely implies that general
measures will be required. For example, in the recent judgment Shlykov and others v. Russia, the
Court indicated under article 46 only that
It will be for the respondent State to implement, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers,
such measures as it considers appropriate to secure the rights of the applicants and other persons in their
position, in order to discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention. It is thus inevitable
that the Court’s judgment will have effects extending beyond the confines of these particular cases. 325

In other cases, the Court has made a more thorough assessment of the systemic nature of the problem,
and again, merely indicated that general measures will be required without specifying the matter
further.326
Such open-ended article 46 indications in judgments have raised both praise and critique. On the one
hand, one CM official argued that just the identification of a problem is helpful in guiding the
execution proceedings, expressly spelling out that remedial measures beyond the payment of just
satisfaction is required.327 On the other hand, Judge Kūris suggested that the language used by the
Court has “often been too tentative and therefore somewhat uneven, confusing and inconsistent”,
implying that in his view, the Court is being excessively cautious, causing confusion.328
Although ‘tentative’, such cautious, indicative wordings can act as the first step to nudge the
respondent state to act beyond the single case. It might be another mechanism for the Court to assess
the receptiveness of the domestic authorities, before considering heavier measures.329
Surprisingly, not only non-monetary remedial indications affect the execution of the measures, but
even monetary remedies awarded to the individual applicants might influence the execution of the
broader systemic problem. The following section will further discuss the Court’s practice regarding
just satisfaction awards in multiple applicant cases and how they might influence the state’s
willingness to solve the underlying problem.

5.4. ‘Quantity Discount’ on Monetary Remedies and its Effect on State Reluctance to Solve
the Underlying Problem
Since the aim of this thesis is to study how the Court addresses systemic human rights violations, it
would not serve the purpose to conduct an elaborate study concerning the awards of just satisfaction
granted to the individual applicants of the cases. However, in some situations, just satisfaction awards
might lead to poor execution of general measures, an outcome which is of interest for this study. The

state might remain reluctant to address the underlying problem, simply being content with paying the
compensation but taking no further measures.
An interesting aspect is that just satisfaction awards are lower in multiple applicant cases than when
the violation concerns a single individual.330 In interviews with judges conducted by Veronica Fikfak,
the judges admitted that they were concerned about compliance if the accumulated just satisfaction
awards were too high.331 For example, for the victims of non-enforced judicial decisions in Ukraine,
a persisting problem, the amounts awarded for non-pecuniary damages decreased significantly over
time.332 Fikfak further argues that this approach by the Court is counter-intuitive from a behavioural
economic viewpoint.333 Instead of being concerned of the ability of the state to pay adequate
compensation, the Court should be more concerned about the message it is sending: the failure to
properly address a systemic violation will not become more expensive, but instead cheaper over time
and with each applicant. The approach certainly does not encourage states to change their conduct,
particularly since the thorough execution of general measures required to solve an underlying
systemic problem are often extensive.334 The payment of just satisfaction awards, especially if they
are reduced over time and with each applicant, might just seem like the easier option.
For the Court, it is a difficult line to walk. Judges wish to ensure that the victims get “at least
something”, especially if the respondent state is going through an economic crisis.335 Similarly,
Gerards argues that the execution of pilot judgments might be facilitated by a display of understanding
from the Court, instead of mere authority and might.336 However, such an approach does not consider
the deterrent effect on the state’s willingness to actually solve the underlying problem if just
satisfaction awards are fixed at an affordable rate. Nevertheless, the Court evidently is concerned
with issues arising at the execution stage when it affords monetary awards, since it seeks to award
redress that it can expect the state to pay. Perhaps it just has not considered the effect such an approach
might have on the execution of general measures.

For example, as the Court has emphasised since Scordino v. Italy (36813/97) (para. 183) in the numerous excessive
length of judicial proceedings cases, a domestic compensatory remedy is in principle not adequate; states must organise
their judicial systems so that they can meet their caseload. Such reforms are undeniably immense.

So far, this chapter has discussed how the Court influences the execution of judgments in advance,
before the judgment has been issued and transferred to be supervised by the CM. Although the CM
supervises the execution of judgments, the following section will argue that the Court does have a
complementary role also in the supervision of execution of judgments.

5.5. A Complementary Role in the Supervision of the Principal Judgment
5.5.1. Follow-up Cases as a Mechanism to Supervise Execution
As a rule, although the Court is becoming more involved in the field of execution, it does not have
jurisdiction to supervise the execution of judgments.337 For example, the Court does not examine
follow-up applications complaining solely of a failure by the respondent state to execute a previous
judgment obtained by the applicant. In such cases, the applicant typically attempts to rely on article
46 by complaining that the respondent state has not fulfilled its obligation to abide by the earlier
judgment of the Court. Since article 46(2) provides that the CM is responsible for supervising the
execution of judgments, the Court has generally ruled that it does not have jurisdiction ratione
materiae to examine whether a state has complied with a specific judgment.338
The Court is therefore concerned of encroachment upon the competence of the CM. However, the
concern only seems to cover the supervision of execution when the same applicant lodges the followup complaint.
For example, in the case of Sidabras and others the applicants complained that the respondent state
had not amended legislation which the Court had found to have given rise to a violation in its earlier
judgment. The Court did note, again, that the abrogation of the domestic law in question would be
the most appropriate general measure to redress the violation, but that the supervision of such general
measures fell within the competence of the CM and not the Court.339 The Court therefore considered

337

Article 46(2) of the Convention confers such competence to the CM.
See, for example, Verein Gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) (32772/02), judgment of 30 June
2009, ECtHR, paras. 61-63, The United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria (No. 2)
(41561/07 and 20972/08), judgment of 18 October 2011, ECtHR, para. 56, Egmez v. Cyprus (12214/07), ECtHR, decision
of 18 September 2012, para. 50, and Kudeshkina v. Russia (28727/11), decision of 17 February 2015, ECtHR, para. 53.
To date, the only exception to the rule is Emre v. Switzerland (no. 2) (5056/10), judgment of 11 October 2011, ECtHR,
where the Court declared admissible and found a violation of article 46.

that the failure by the respondent state to implement general measures did not, in itself, amount to a
new violation.
However, the case was lodged by three applicants who had all received a judgment by the Court on
the same issue earlier. The Court did find a new violation in respect of one of the applicants, since he
had lodged new domestic proceedings since obtaining the first judgment by the Court, and had
received a new unfavourable domestic decision, again explicitly relying on the unamended
legislation.340 Therefore, although the Court could not examine the non-execution of general
measures in abstracto, the judgment very clearly indicated both to the state and the CM that the
abrogation of the law in question was necessary to fully comply with the Convention requirements.
Subsequently, the Court has indirectly supervised the execution of previous judgments by adopting
judgments in respect of new applicants who are complaining of the same issue, or even specifically
complaining of general measures implemented at the domestic level in response to a judgment by the
Court. Cases concerning the excessive length of proceedings in Italy were some of the earliest cases
where the Court identified systemic issues.341 The pilot-judgment procedure had not been introduced
at the time, and the Court did not indicate remedial measures in the early cases. Nonetheless, Italy
introduced the so-called Pinto Act, a domestic remedy which offered redress also to those applicants
who had already lodged a complaint with the Strasbourg Court.342
Unfortunately, in the view of the Court, the Pinto Act did not resolve the systemic issue.343 It was a
purely compensatory remedy, not resolving the ineffectiveness of the Italian judicial system.344 As
such, it transferred the burden of applications from the Strasbourg Court to the domestic courts, which
themselves had also been overburdened already.345 Furthermore, the calculation of just satisfaction
awards diverged between the Italian domestic courts vis-à-vis the Strasbourg Court.346 The Court was
compelled to continue the examination of follow-up cases a number of times, and recognising
developments made since the earliest judgments (such as the introduction of the Pinto Act), it

indicated general measures that were still required by the respondent state to comply with its
obligations under the Convention.347
By examining new cases complaining of the same systemic problem as previous applicants, the Court
may seek to address the issue once again and review the measures adopted following its previous
judgments.348 This practice culminates in the follow-up cases examined by the Court following a pilot
judgment. In such follow-up cases, the Court examines the remedies introduced at the domestic level
following the pilot judgment; if the domestic remedy appears effective, the application will be
declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, but exceptionally, if the domestic
remedy is not effective, the Court will declare the application admissible and, once again, seek to
address the systemic problem in question.349 Admittedly, the assessment made by the Court remains
somewhat superficial, and most commonly, the mere establishment of a new remedy will suffice,
even when no stable practice has emerged.350 Although the Court is aware that the supervision of the
execution of judgments falls within the competence of the CM, it does not seem too bothered about
this aspect of supervising execution.351
Follow-up cases may serve as a method for the Court to continue the examination of general measures
implemented by domestic authorities and their capability to tackle the systemic issue in question.
Declaring inadmissible such complaints under article 46(2) would be quite the strict self-imposed
interpretation of the Convention; after all, the applicants in such cases are relying on substantive
provisions of the Convention and are victims of human rights violations. The Court is only indirectly
ruling on matters of execution. Where the CM has declared a previous judgment executed, the Court
will approve the remedies adopted since as well, careful not to encroach upon the competence of the

For example, in Zadrić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (18804/04), decision of 16 November 2010, in response to general
measures adopted since the pilot judgment Suljagic (27912/02), the Court found the new remedy to be effective, while in
the cases Ilyushkin and others v. Russia (5734/08 et al.) and Kalinkin and others v. Russia (16967/10 et al.), judgments
of 17 April 2012, follow-ups to the Burdov (no. 2) (33509/04) pilot judgment, the Court exceptionally could not fully
endorse the newly created domestic remedy and was compelled to issue new judgments concerning the same issue.

CM.352 Only in cases where the previous judgment has still been under the supervision of the CM and
no final resolution adopted, has the Court indicated further general measures to bring the situation up
to Convention standards.353

5.5.2. … Until the Court has had Enough?
Section 4.1.3. discussed the continuing over-all failure by the Ukrainian government to execute the
Ivanov pilot judgment. For years, the Court had been going back and forth adjourning and then
continuing to examine repetitive cases, as well as attempting to find new solutions to the problem.354
Eventually, in Burmych and others, which joined together over 12,000 follow-up applications in the
aftermath of Ivanov in 2017, the Grand Chamber remarked that it was for the CM to supervise the
execution of obligations arising from pilot judgments, and that the Court’s role was “essentially
limited to its identification of a systemic problem and, if appropriate, indication of general remedial
measures to be taken in execution”.355 The statement is at odds with earlier follow-up cases where
the Court, in fact, reviewed the execution of general measures.356 The Court itself even proceeded to
list earlier follow-up cases where it had done exactly that.357
The Court then went on to argue why a new approach was needed, and with a majority vote of ten to
seven, struck all 12,148 applications out of its list, to instead be processed by the CM under the
execution proceedings following the Ivanov pilot judgment.358
According to article 37 of the Convention, the Court may strike an application out of its list of cases
if the applicant does not intend to pursue his application, the matter has been resolved, or for any
other reason established by the Court. Rule 43(3) of the Rules of Court provides that when an
application has been struck out, it will be transmitted to the CM, which will supervise “the execution
of any undertakings which may have been attached to the discontinuance or solution of the matter.”
In this case, the CM would therefore supervise the Ukrainian government’s undertakings to

implement the general measures which the Court had imposed already in the Ivanov judgment,
ensuring relief for all applicants whose complaints arose from the same systemic problem.359
The Court came to this conclusion after the Ukrainian government presented data according to which
there were still some 120,000 potential applicants with an unenforced judicial decision in Ukraine,
capable of continuing the massive influx of applications and further compromising the effectiveness
of the Convention system.360 The Court noted that although it had created an accelerated summary
procedure for follow-up cases to Ivanov, no meaningful impact had been made, and the number of
applicants seeking redress from the Court (unable to do so at the domestic level) had instead only
grown by each year.361 If continued, the Court saw no other prospect than the growing number of
applicants substituting the Court for the domestic authorities, who should be offering redress in the
individual cases, as the Ivanov pilot judgment provided in imperative terms.362
Therefore, the Court finally concluded that “[…] nothing is to be gained, nor will justice be best
served, by the repetition of its findings in a lengthy series of comparable cases, which would place a
significant burden on its own resources […]”.363
The case originally encompassed only five applications, but in the judgment, the Court joined the
12,143 remaining pending applications to it as well.364 Only the five original applicants’ claims had
been examined by the Grand Chamber; the remaining 12,143 applications, annexed to the judgment,
had not been subject to judicial review.365 Considering that Ukraine had failed to introduce any
general measures since Ivanov, meaning that there was no domestic remedy for the applicants to rely
on, the ensuing situation must have induced uncertainty.366According to the joint dissenting opinion
by the seven judges who voted in the minority, no case, including strike-out decisions, should be
decided without judicial consideration.367

In the dissenting opinion, the judges note that the CM as a political body does not have the
competence to examine the individual cases, especially since it will entail non-enforceable political
decisions – achieved together with the Ukrainian government, the ‘wrongdoer’ itself – instead of
being achieved through judgments by a judicial body.368 The judges in the minority further claimed
that the CM was not at all consulted about the decision to transfer thousands of cases to them and was
not given the chance to comment their view about this new interpretation of the division of
competences.369
The decision to strike these applications out is, in theory, in line with article 46 providing the CM the
competence to supervise the execution of judgments.370 However, in practice, it is a deviation from
the Court’s earlier interpretation of article 46; when faced with a sufficiently massive influx of
applications, it chose to simply pass on the burden and change its interpretation. It comes without
saying that the shift in institutional balance is substantial; as the dissenting judges noted, 12,143 of
the applications had not been subject to any form of judicial review, and would instead be examined
by the respondent state, under supervision of the CM, through a political process.371 In practice, the
legal obligations imposed by judgments was now off the shoulders for Ukraine in thousands of cases.
It should be clear that all applicants have the right to have the facts of their case examined individually
by the Court, otherwise the right to individual application is in practice denied. 372 It is already
questionable for the Court to adopt a new approach, not for a “legal interpretation of human rights”,
but solely because in this case it suited the Court best.373 However, even this could possibly be
justified had the Court actually examined the facts of each individual case, an exclusive competence
of the Court that should not be open to interpretation.

6. Conclusion
Since 2004, the Court has sought to address systemic human rights violations by identifying the
underlying causes and indicating general measures going beyond the single applicant of the case.
Now that the practice has evolved and matured, some distinct patterns can be identified, although
many aspects remain inconsistent – or flexible, depending on the perspective.
The most prominent approach of the Court is the pilot-judgment procedure, but throughout the years,
the Court has issued more quasi-pilot judgments than ‘full’ pilot judgments. The characteristics of
both pilot and quasi-pilot judgments vary extensively, and definite demarcations are difficult to make.
Rule 61 of the Rules of Court on the pilot-judgment procedure has set the framework for the pilotjudgment procedure, but at the same time, left plenty open for interpretation. By its very nature, the
procedure allows flexibility, which has let the Court accommodate it to various situations.374
In several cases, it remains unclear whether the Court applied the ‘full’ pilot-judgment procedure or
issued a quasi-pilot judgment. Since pilot judgments have been issued since 2004, but the procedure
was not codified until 2011, some early inconsistencies may be excused considering its infancy.
However, as late as in 2013, the Court issued a judgment in the case of Zorica Jovanovic v. Serbia,
which heavily resembles a pilot judgment, but was not identified as such by the Court nor the CM.
General measures were imposed in the operative provisions and similar applications were adjourned,
but the Court made no assessment on the systemic nature of the problem.375
Such a recent divergence complicates the analysis, but since then, the Court’s practice has become
more streamlined. Pilot judgments are now more often clearly distinguished from quasi-pilot
judgments; in the last eight years, it is only in ‘full’ pilot judgments that the type of general measures
required have been included in the operative provisions of the judgment.376 However, although the

374

See also Kindt, 2018, p. 26.
Rule 61(3) of the Rules of Court requires such an assessment to be made, and Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee
of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 12 May
2004, at its 114th Session) also called the Court to identify the underlying problem.
376
The last case to contain specific general measures in the operative provisions outside the ‘full’ pilot-judgment
procedure was Zorica Jovanovic v. Serbia (21794/08), judgment of 26 March 2013, ECtHR. In the operative provisions
of the quasi-pilot judgments McCaughey and others v. the United Kingdom (43098/09), judgment of 16 July 2013,
ECtHR, and Ali Riza and others v. Turkey (30226/10 and 5506/16), judgment of 28 January 2020, ECtHR, the Court only
imposed a general obligation to remedy the systemic problem, without specifying the type of general measures required;
see also section 5.2.
375

67

distinction between ‘full’ pilots and quasi-pilots has been clarified, it is still difficult to predict the
approach of the Court in any given case. Nevertheless, this thesis has sought to find common patterns
among cases addressing systemic issues.
An overwhelmingly important consideration in the selection of the approach appears to be the level
of cooperation of the state. Throughout the thesis, it has become clear that the Court is extremely
reluctant to invoke the full pilot-judgment procedure in case the respondent state is uncooperative.
This requirement can even implicitly be read from Rule 61(2)(a), providing that the Court must seek
the views of the parties to the case before applying the pilot-judgment procedure. That being said,
initial opposition does not automatically preclude the Court from applying the procedure; especially
after having gathered substantial information about the systemic problem, the Court may gain
credibility and persuade the state to be cooperative.
Already after the Broniowski judgment, Luzius Wildhaber, president of the Court at the time,
considered this ‘requirement’ of state cooperation also to be the most fundamental problem of the
procedure.377 The over-all failure of Ukraine to execute the Ivanov pilot judgment, which eventually
led to the decision to strike out over 12,000 applications in Burmych and others, further reaffirmed
that the absence of state cooperation could be detrimental for the success of the pilot-judgment
procedure. Since the pilot-judgment procedure shifts the responsibility of the repetitive cases from
the docket of the Court to that of the domestic authorities, the Court would certainly want to be
affirmed that the domestic authorities will follow through.
Further, the Court is reluctant to apply the pilot-judgment procedure or even indicate general
measures when the substantive issue at hand is complex or it is difficult to pinpoint the exact causes
of the underlying problem. Making an assessment based on speculations could discredit the authority
of the Court. However, even in such cases execution could be facilitated by simply explaining to the
domestic authorities that the problem must be addressed, spelling out that measures beyond the
individual applicant are required. Further elaborations are not necessarily needed.
Additionally, the pilot-judgment procedure has only rarely been invoked as the first response when
the Court has identified a systemic problem. More often, in cases caused by a systemic problem, the
Court has gradually moved from declaratory judgments to quasi-pilot judgments, possibly eventually

377

Wildhaber, 2009, p. 89.

68

employing the pilot-judgment procedure if the underlying issue still has not been resolved. Indeed,
actors within the Court have confirmed that the optimal moment to move beyond declaratory
judgments is actively discussed in situations of partial or non-execution.
Regarding the Court’s practice when either adjourning or continuing to process repetitive
applications, again, one of the concerns seems to be that of execution. The Court anticipates the
approach which will most effectively put pressure on the respondent state. At the same time, it is still
concerned of its own workload; if the number of repetitive applications is high, it will not process
them all, but perhaps adjourn part of them. Furthermore, the substantive issue of the underlying
problem is of importance: The Court continues to process repetitive applications only in such cases
where their adjournment would be particularly disadvantageous to the applicants.
When selecting any approach to address a systemic problem, the over-arching issue for the Court
seems to be concerns of compliance at the execution stage. The Court selects the approach which it
can anticipate the respondent state to execute, sometimes at the expense of the individual applicant.
To make the process more consistent and transparent, the parties to all cases could be asked to submit
their views regarding remedies routinely, and not just when the Court considers applying the full
pilot-judgment procedure. Through this process, on the one hand, the applicant could provide the
Court with valuable information. On the other hand, based on the submissions of the respondent state,
the Court could perhaps also better anticipate its receptiveness to a particular approach. The process
could hence gain transparency and credibility.
