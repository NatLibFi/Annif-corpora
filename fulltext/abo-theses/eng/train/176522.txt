Title: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing: The Role of Conversion Design on
the Corporate Website
Supervisor: Markku Heikkilä
Abstract: As the buying process has moved online, the corporate website has taken a
central role in B2B lead generation. Consequently, the website is the main lead
generation tool for many B2B companies. The main goal in online lead generation is
to convince website visitors to submit their contact information to the owner of the
website, this is known as converting. Due to a website’s general lack of human-tohuman interaction, the site alone must be able to convince visitors to convert.
Therefore, companies must develop the design and content of their websites to facilitate
conversions, in other words, they must utilize conversion design.
One company that uses their corporate website as the main lead generation tool is
Hibox Systems Oy Ab. This master’s thesis was conducted as a case study on behalf
of this case-company to evaluate the role of conversion design on the corporate website
in a lead generation context.
The case study incorporated a qualitative literature review and a qualitative content
analysis while it also utilized quantitative data to support the conclusions made in the
qualitative research. The study can therefore be classified as mixed methods research.
The principles of conversion design that were found through the literature review were
assembled into a hypothesized model and applied on the case-company’s website. This
resulted in an increase of the conversion rate, meaning that there was an increase in
leads after the hypothesized model was applied.
The results of the study were therefore positive. The hypothesized model of conversion
design was proven to be a successful method for creating corporate websites that
generate a higher number of leads. Consequently, conversion design was concluded to
play a major role in online lead generation.

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

1 INTRODUCTION
The first chapter will present the background information and underlying problem that
form the foundation of this thesis. It will also present the aim of the study, how the
research was conducted and the research dependencies, while finally presenting the
structure the thesis itself.

1.1 Background
In digital marketing, there are few online channels as important as the corporate website.
The corporate website is the only channel that marketers have complete control over as
they are free to design, optimize and tweak without any external restrictions (Ryan 2014,
p. 44). Websites can be used for a multitude of purposes, of which lead generation has
become one of the most common. Especially in business-to-business (B2B) markets, lead
generation is used as a primary marketing practice. Lead generation can be seen all over
the web, from singing up for newsletters or webinar to submitting a sales inquiry for a
specific product or service. However, most companies do not fully leverage the potential
of their lead generation websites, as they fail to convert potential buyers into leads due to
a lacking website design. Often, corporate websites are designed with a company-centric
approach without further consideration for the visitors using the site, i.e. they contain
what the company that owns the site wants them to contain, rather than what the website
visitors and potential customers really need. The most successful websites have been
shown to prioritize a user experience that visitors truly enjoy, but despite this customercentric web design is still surprisingly rare (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 36). Delivering
what the potential buyers are looking for is a prerequisite for them to convert, because
visitors who are not convinced of the value in the product or service offering are very
unlikely to sign up for a newsletter or complete a contact form. However, they are very
likely to simply move on the next competitor in line, such is the nature of the web.
Companies engaged in online lead generation need to invest in developing their websites
to generate as many leads as possible and to maximize the quality of those leads. B2B
companies in particular that are bound by a lengthy buying process (Gillin &
Schwartzman 2011, p. 7) should strive to convert as many website visitors as possible to
achieve a growing trajectory. In most B2B cases, a converted lead does not equal a sale
1

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

due to the buying process, but a converted lead does equal a sales opportunity. This is the
essence of online lead generation in B2B, increasing sales opportunities. According to a
study made by HubSpot Research (2016), 72% of companies with fewer than 50 leads
per month do not achieve their revenue goals. While companies that do acquire more than
50 leads per month were shown to have a substantially greater chance of hitting their
goals. The tipping point of 50 leads is obviously not universal for all markets and
businesses, but the study did show that there is a relationship between a higher number
of leads and a higher chance of reaching revenue goals. This means that the more leads a
company has, the likelier its business is to grow.
In lead generation, the inbound marketing framework has become the main marketing
concept for generating leads online. The website is the main lead generator or conversion
engine in this framework (Kurvinen & Seppä 2016, p. 187). In practice, this means the
website is responsible for the actual gathering of leads. As mentioned above, many
companies fail to fully utilize the potential of their websites despite its recognized
importance in the lead generation process. The virtual nature of websites means that they
mostly lack human-to-human interaction, which puts on-page content and design at the
forefront of converting website visitors into sales leads. To fully leverage the corporate
website as a critical part in the procurement of new business, companies need to design
and plan their sites accordingly. Generating leads is the fundamental task of any lead
generation site. This thesis will research the practice of designing websites for this task.

1.2 Research problem
Hibox Systems Oy Ab is a B2B company that primarily focuses on online lead generation
as its core marketing tactic. Therefore, the procurement of actionable sales leads is the
foremost priority of the company’s marketing efforts. The company utilizes a corporate
website to procure new leads and to market the company’s service offering and brand.
The website is the most important marketing communications channel the company
currently deploys as a part of their marketing strategy. Most of the company’s sales leads
are generated through the website, effectively making the website not only the most
important communication channel between the company and its potential buyers, but also
the most important channel for increasing sales opportunities. Despite the importance of
the website within the company’s marketing strategy and lead generation funnel, design
2

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

principles for lead generation has not been considered to any greater extent at the time of
the website’s development (Turajlic 2018).
At the time this thesis was started, desktop traffic on the website generated roughly 35
leads per month with a conversion rate of 1,46 % (averages for 2018, see appendix A).
With regard to the sales and revenue the company is generating in total, the numbers of
leads are not too low. However, the conversion rate shows great potential for increasing
the number of website visitors that convert into leads. This combined with the fact that
the website’s main task is to generate leads but has not been designed with modern
conversion design principles, highlight a flaw in the lead generation process.
Additionally, many leads generated from the website do not fulfil the specifications
required for constituting an actionable lead (Komarov 2018). It can therefore be
concluded that through proper research and development of the website design, the
number of generated leads and the quality of those leads could hypothetically be
improved.

1.3 Aim of the study and research questions
This thesis is conducted as a case study on behalf of the case-company Hibox Systems
Oy Ab. The aim of the study is to research the role of design on the corporate website as
it refers to the generation of sales leads. Upon completion of the study the case-company
will be able to draw conclusions regarding whether or not the design of their site should
be considered as a type of lead generation tactic. In practice, the research will study if the
number of website visitors that convert into actionable leads can be increased by
developing the visual design and on-page content of the website. This will be done by
creating a new design for one preselected page on the case-company’s corporate website,
which will then be compared with the previous design.
The research questions have been defined as the following:
1. How can the conversion rate of a corporate website be increased through design?
2. How has the new design of the case-company’s subject page affected the
conversion rate?

3

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

1.4 Limitations
This case study is specifically limited to the case-company’s corporate website. No results
or methodologies regarding conversions or design on other websites will be
acknowledged apart from proven frameworks defined in the literature review (see chapter
4 and 5). Only one webpage on the company’s website will be used as a test subject for
the study, meaning that all development and testing will be confined to one URL and not
the entire website. Furthermore, the study will not concern itself with any other aspects
of marketing or lead generation that are not in direct relation to the website, nor will it
consider aspects such as how traffic is generated to the website. It will only concern itself
with situations taking place on the website, from visitors landing on the subject page to
converting. This means the study will also not consider how leads should be handled after
they have converted.
The analysis and evaluation of both the new and the old design will be performed through
screenshots. Meaning that mostly static elements that can be interpreted visually will be
acknowledged in the study, however, some interactive elements will be included as well.
Other elements that can be interpreted by the human senses, such as sounds for example,
will not be taken into consideration. Nor will technical aspects such as loading times and
server speeds that otherwise might affect the user experience be included in the study.
Google Analytics will be used for the collection of website visitor data to be used in
combination with above mentioned screenshots and to determine the conversion rate of
the subject page. Mainly data for the subject webpage will be used throughout the study.
Data from any other page on the website or aggregated data for the entire site will only
be used to present broader aspects such as the average conversion rate, or to better
illustrate overall website performance and only if this is needed to support the readers
understanding of a specific subject or process (all data used in the study can be viewed
under Appendices).
The case-company receives roughly 75 % (see appendix B) of its website traffic to the
subject page from desktop computers and laptops. Therefore, the study will be confined
to analyzing the desktop version of the subject webpage. Other formats of the webpage
design, including mobile and tablet versions will not be included in the study. The
screenshots used in the study will also be limited to a specific screen resolution of 1920
x 1080 as this is the most used resolution among the visitors to the subject page (see
4

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

appendix C). Moreover, it would not be practical or reliable to perform the study based
on multiple screen sizes or devices as it would require an extremely wide scope. All
screenshots for analysis was taken in the same web browser, which in this case is Google
Chrome, to avoid any inconsistencies that might occur between browsers.

1.5 Structure of thesis
The thesis is divided into 7 chapters, of which chapters 1 and 2 work as introductory
chapters presenting the background for the study and the case-company. Chapter 3 depicts
the research methodology, while Chapter 4 and 5 respectively, represent the findings of
a literature review that focused on examining existing literature regarding lead generation
and conversion design to create a hypothesized model of optimal conversion design. This
model was used in the development of a new design for the subject page and in the
evaluation of the page. Chapter 6 presents the results of the research by evaluating the
new and old design of the webpage and by examining the conversion rate. Chapter 7 is a
concluding chapter that answers the research questions, provides recommendations for
the case-company, suggestions for further research and takes a critical look on the study
itself. All chapters have multiple sections that depicts various subjects related to the main
subject of the chapter in question. Headings for all chapters and sub-sections can be found
int the table of contents.

2 CASE-COMPANY: HIBOX SYSTEMS OY AB
This chapter will present the case-company of this thesis. After briefly presenting the
company’s history and fundamentality, it will go through the company’s core business
along with its verticals and the company’s marketing & sales strategy.

2.1 The company
Hibox Systems Oy Ab (hereinafter Hibox) is a small-to-medium-sized enterprise
operating within the Information Technology (IT) industry, specifically with developing
and selling interactive information and entertainment solutions for television-based
services. The company is privately owned and is headquartered in Turku, Finland, while
operating a research and development (R&D) facility in Vaasa, Finland and a global sales
office in Vienna, Austria. Hibox employs 32 individuals, of which the majority are either
back-end or front-end developers. The rest of the staff consists of administrative
personnel including sales & marketing professionals (Granholm 2018).
Founded in 2004 to develop a new IPTV-solution (Internet protocol television) for a
newly developed hotel chain, Hibox’s service offering has developed into a complete
television technology service that thanks to its flexibility can be adapted to many
television-based systems. This allows the company to focus on a wide range of customer
segments and can facilitate a high number of projects with a relatively limited number of
staff.

2.2 Service offering and verticals
The core product consists of a middleware-platform. Middleware is per definition
“software that facilitates exchange of data between two application programs within the
same environment, or across different hardware and network environments”
(WebFinanceInc. 2018). Focused on television technology, Hibox’s middlewareplatform is designed to connect existing application programs to end-user devices such
as televisions, mobiles and tablets. Apart from this solution, Hibox develops additional
products for their customers that complete the service offering. These products consist of
e.g. casting solutions, mobile applications, and software and hardware for both evacuation
and housekeeping systems. The company markets their products and services to other
6

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

businesses in need of serving their own end-customers with television technology-based
solutions. A typical business model in B2B context as the end-user is often not the same
individual as the actual purchaser (Gillin & Schwartzman 2011, p. 6-7). This effectively
classifies Hibox as a business-to-business (B2B) company.
Hibox focuses their service offering on two main verticals with several customer
segments in each. The verticals are Hospitality and IPTV & OTT (Internet protocol
television and over-the-top) providers. The hospitality vertical’s largest customer
segment is hotels, but does also consist of cruise ships, healthcare facilities, senior living
and even correctional facilities. Providers within IPTV & OTT mainly consist of
telecommunications operators, media companies, broadcasters and OTT providers.
Figure 1: Hibox’s vertical markets split into customer segments.

Due to its character as a middleware / software company and its reseller business model,
Hibox is a truly global brand. According to Hibox CEO Staffan Granholm the company’s
activities are not constrained by any geographical limitations (Turun Sanomat 2013).
Thanks to this fact and regardless of the company’s small stature, Hibox has managed to
grow into one of the strongest competitors on the market, especially in the Nordic
hospitality market as of recent years, but also on a global scale in multiple verticals. For
example, the increased digitization of the healthcare industry is becoming a predominant
driver for further development of the healthcare-specific solutions and is forecasted to
increase revenue streams in the coming years.

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

2.3 Marketing and sales strategy
With a small marketing budget and a staff of 32 employees, of which the majority focus
on developing and supporting Hibox’s core business, there are limited resources available
for marketing communications. Currently, all marketing and sales efforts are performed
with a small team consisting of the company’s C-level executives, sales personnel and
one marketing employee. Due to these limited resources, the marketing and sales strategy
is two-fold, it combines a reseller-model with in-house marketing and consists of three
key areas: lead generation, sales and account management. The strategy is based on the
inbound marketing framework which is explained in more detail in section 3.1.1. The
strategy is illustrated in figure 2.
Figure 2: Hibox’s marketing and sales strategy.

The reseller-model works as an added dimension to the marketing and sales strategy and
represents the majority of all international sales while all domestic operations are
performed by Hibox. The reseller network is crucial to the company’s growth because
with current resources, Hibox could not generate the same number of sales as they do
today without this global network. Therefore, the reseller network plays a key role and is
an integrated part of the marketing and sales strategy (Shaw 2018). However, many of
the leads that resellers handle are assigned to them by Hibox and are originally acquired
through Hibox’s website.
Hibox supports resellers with marketing material, lead acquisition and other sales
operations to help the resellers effectively generate new customers. However, the resellers
market Hibox’s products independently within their specific region and their marketing
efforts are not directly controlled by Hibox.

Apart from supporting the resellers, Hibox’s own marketing efforts mainly focuses on
cost-efficient online marketing done in-house with the goal of attracting high-quality
leads of a sufficient number (Granholm 2018). Additionally, Hibox also performs some
offline marketing consisting mainly of industry-specific tradeshows and exhibitions, or
collaborations with partners. Events are also advertised through online channels.
Despite the reseller networks important role in the strategy, most of the company’s
marketing resources go into in-house marketing. Due to this fact, and the fact that Hibox
does not directly control the marketing activities of the resellers, Hibox’s own marketing
efforts is the constitutional focus of this study. The primary output of these marketing
efforts are leads. As figure 2 shows, the lead acquisition plan forms the main part of all
marketing activities and is the first step to generate actual sales.
2.3.1 Lead generation plan
The lead generation plan, as with the majority of the marketing activities is based online.
The plan is built around the corporate website www.hibox.tv. The website is the primary
channel for all the company’s marketing communications. Traffic from all other online,
and to a great extent offline, sources are directed towards the website (Lehtinen 2017, p.
7). The website works as a platform on which the company can present their products and
brand, but first and foremost it is a platform for acquiring leads. Leads are collected by
convincing website visitors to complete a contact form, which allows the company’s sales
team to reach out to the potential customers and secure a sale.
The primary method of attracting visitors to the website is search engine optimization
(SEO). Through SEO Hibox aims to achieve high rankings in Google’s search engine
result pages and thus, drive a high number of high-quality traffic towards the website by
attracting the interest of the users. High-quality traffic in this case refers to traffic that
consists of B2B buyers that is in the buying process of finding a service provider of
Hibox’s nature, meaning that they have a true intent of converting into a lead already
when they arrive at a landing page on the site. A secondary traffic source is social media.
Specifically, LinkedIn and Twitter are used to nurture existing relationships, increase
brand awareness but also ultimately drive traffic towards the website as a secondary
method after SEO.

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

As could be seen already in figure 2 in the preceding section, the company’s lead
generation plan revolves heavily around the website. Together with the traffic sources,
the website forms an online lead generation funnel in which the website plays a central
role working as the main enabler in the conversion process. Figure 3 illustrates the funnel
and shows its relevance within the marketing and sales strategy.
Hibox’s business revolves heavily around the procurement of new leads and the company
website has been identified as a decisive part of the lead generation plan. As determined
in section 1.2 the website was not originally designed with any specific frameworks that
aim to increase conversions, albeit its decisive role in the procurement of leads is
indisputable. It is therefore in the interest of the case-company to study if the conversion
rate and quality of leads can be improved by focusing on the most central element in the
lead funnel, the website.
Figure 3: The online lead generation funnel of Hibox.

As per section 1.3, this case study will focus on if and how Hibox can improve their
conversion rate and the quality of incoming leads with the company website as the
principal subject of study. Improving the conversion rate directly translates to an
increased number of leads that enables an increase in revenue for Hibox and an
improvement of the company’s marketing communications.

2.4 Chapter summary
This chapter has presented the case-company and its fundamentals, its product and service
offering, the operating industry and its verticals, as well as the company’s marketing and
sales strategy. Furthermore, it has defined the importance of lead generation within the
case-company’s marketing efforts and explained the key role of the corporate website as
a conversion-platform in the lead generation funnel. The website has the key objective of
providing sales qualified leads for the company’s sales team. Chapter 4 will take a more
detailed look at lead generation, lead generation through websites, the application of lead
generation in B2B markets and how the B2B buying behavior facilitates this type of
marketing. Chapter 4 will also focus on what role design plays in the online lead
generation process, before chapter 5 will define designing for conversion in more detail.
However, before diving into the main topic of this study, the research methodology will
be presented in the following chapter.

3 METHODOLOGY
This chapter will depict the research methodology of this thesis. It will explain the
complete research design by depicting the research methods that were chosen to answer
the research questions, the type of data collected to analyze the results and how those
results were interpreted.

3.1 Case study research
The main aim of this study is to assess what role design plays in the generation of leads
through the corporate website. The author of this study has chosen to call the practice of
increasing the number of leads generated by a corporate website through design as simply:
conversion design. Why this exact term was chosen is discussed more thoroughly in
section 4.2. The case-company Hibox Systems uses online lead generation to gather sales
leads, the company’s website works as the primary tool for this endeavor. This study
came about as the researcher is an employee of the case-company and improving the
company’s lead generation efforts is a continuous priority due to its importance in the
sales cycle. In addition to the case-company’s interest in the topic, the researcher has both
a personal and professional interest in the field.
With the objective of improving the conversion rate as a guide for the study itself, the
research and the accompanying research questions focus on how this objective can be
achieved. When a how or why question is asked about a contemporary set of behavioral
events of which the researcher has little or no control, the research falls under the
definition of a case study. The case study is an empirical method that investigates a
contemporary phenomenon in an in-depth manner and within the phenomenon’s realworld context, the phenomenon being the so-called case (Yin 2018, p. 9-15). Järvinen
(2012, p. 10-11) similarly classifies the case study as primarily being a theory-creating
approach of an empirical nature that aims to study reality, and stresses what the definition
of reality actually is. However, Järvinen (2012, p. 36-63) also outlines what he calls
theory-testing approaches and some case studies also fall under this approach depending
on the context of the case and the study.
The theory-testing approach aims to analyze if a particular theory, model or framework
illustrates a certain part of reality particularly well. In other words, researchers test the
12

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

theory. The selected theory can be chosen out of numerous contenders that are relevant
for the phenomenon of interest. However, in some studies there is no proper theory,
meaning that the researchers must build the theory themselves (Järvinen 2012, p. 36).
Malhotra (2007, p. 42) defines case studies within qualitative research as being “an
intensive examination of a few selected cases of the phenomenon of interest”. He also
states that the website is an example of such a case.
Due to the available definitions of case studies and the context within which they are
used, the case study is a natural fit for this study. The phenomenon of interest is the role
of design within online lead generation as per the aim of the study. The case in which this
phenomenon is to be tested is represented by the corporate website of the case-company.
This particular phenomenon i.e. lead generation and conversion design is very limited in
existing theories and research. Virtually no, academic research or literature was found
relating to this specific topic. Some related research form other research fields were
identified, such as the studies made by Harris and Goode (2010) and Santos (2003) as
presented in chapter 4. Educational books on the topic however do exist, although good
references these books have been mostly produced by business practitioners and
companies, meaning they fall outside of the borders of academia.
The existing theories, models and frameworks suggest that for this study the theory must
first be built in order to research the phenomenon of interest, as Järvinen (2012, p. 36)
recommends. Yin (2018, p. 34) also suggests constructing preliminary theories or
theoretical propositions regarding the study’s topic when designing case studies.
Therefore, the research must first define how design effects conversions based on existing
theories and literature through a literature review.
This is also in line with Hevner, March, Park & Ram’s (2004) framework for information
systems research, which suggest that IS research consist of two stages; develop & build
and justify & evaluate, see figure 4.

13

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 4: Information systems research framework (Hevner et al. 2004, p. 80).

According to this model, the research problem and consequently the phenomenon of
interest is defined by the existing environment. The phenomenon manifests itself as a
tangible business need. In turn, the knowledge base consisting of existing research,
frameworks, theories, data analysis techniques etc. provides the material for carrying out
IS research. In this study, the case-company, its website and the importance of lead
generation comprise the business need, while existing literature and the researcher’s
professional expertise make up the knowledge base. With the model by Hevner et al.
(2004) as the guiding framework, researchers can aim to develop and build theories for
their study, which can then be tested in real-world scenarios through justification and
evaluation. In doing so, the research results in an application of some sort to the existing
environment (hopefully meeting the initial business need) and a contribution to the
knowledgebase, as can be seen in figure 4.
The research design of this study was based on the model by Hevner et al. (2004) due to
its appropriate fit for the aim of the study. The environment and business needs are what
drove the study in the first place, the knowledge base aided the research that studied how
and if those needs could be met. In practice, this meant that through a literature review of
the knowledge base, consisting of existing research, theories and methods, a hypothesized
model of conversion design was created in chapter 4 and 5. After which the model was
14

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

tested and analyzed in a real-world environment through a preselected webpage on the
case-company’s corporate website, as depicted in chapter 6. The effect of the
hypothesized model on the conversion rate was measured through relevant metrics. As
per the above and following the model by Hevner et al. (2004) in combination with
Järvinen’s (2012) suggestions of theory building in theory-testing research the study can
be broken down into two main steps.
1. Develop and build: Forward a hypothesized model of conversion design through
literature review of existing theories and previous research.
2. Justify and evaluate: Test the robustness of the model through application on the
subject webpage followed by a qualitative content analysis supported by
additional quantitative data.
Step 2 involved actually designing a new version of the subject page based on the
hypothesized model and analysis of how that version performed in comparison to the
previous version. The subject page’s design before the implementation of the model will
throughout this thesis be referred to as the old design, and the design after the
implementation will be referred to as the new design.
The model by Hevner et al. (2004) draws similarities with both Järvinen’s (2012) and also
March and Smith’s (1995) model for IS research in the sense that all three models discuss
IS research as being a two-fold process of build and evaluate. Albeit they use different
terminology to some extent, the main premise remains very similar. March and Smith
(1995, p. 258) refer to the build process as the construction of an artifact, while the
evaluate process refers to the creation of criteria for assessing the artifacts performance.
The hypothesized model in this study represents the artifact March and Smith refer to.
The fact that these three models are fairly similar strengthens the appropriateness of the
model by Hevner et al. (2004) for this study and consequently the reliability of the
research design.
When it comes to optimizing for more leads, Rabhan (2013, p. 90) suggests beginning
with a page in the conversion funnel that most visitors have to go through to convert. Ash
(2012, p. 252) also suggest beginning with the best performing pages that generate the
most revenue. Additionally, no page on a website is exactly the same as another in terms
of design. Some visual elements remain the same in order to portray a coherent and
understandable design, but the visual and written content of a page should not be
15

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

duplicated to another. Therefore, it is not feasible to analyze the role of design across all
pages on the website simultaneously, but rather focus on one page as a subject of study.
The page chosen for this study is the main page for the company’s hospitality products:
https://www.hibox.tv/Hotel-TV-Platform.shtml. It is a page that arguably all visitors
interested in the hospitality vertical go through, as such it is also one of the website’s top
performing pages in terms of conversions and traffic (see appendix D).
3.1.1 Qualitative literature review
To develop the hypothesized model, a literature review was performed. The literature
review is a research method in which the researcher reviews a body of literature,
represented by the knowledge base as per the Hevner et al. (2004) to immerse himself in
the phenomenon of interest and to identify key concepts and methodologies that are
relevant to the study (Hart 2018, p. 31). Due to the unquantifiable nature of this literature
review it classifies as a qualitative research method. Bryman and Bell (2011, p. 26-27)
defines the qualitative research strategy as being an inductive approach that concerns
itself with the generation of theory. Which is exactly what this literature review was
conducted for; generation of theory presented through the hypothesized model. As such
the literature review constitutes the develop and build stage of the model by Hevner et al.
(2004).
The literature review comprises chapter 4 and 5 of this study and consisted of existing
literature and research within the fields of inbound marketing, lead generation, usercentered design, conversion rate optimization, landing page optimization, and eservicesapes. The review included references from other fields as well consisting of both
academical research and other sources, but the ones mentioned above make out the topics
and frameworks that were found the most relevant for conversion design. As mentioned
previously, the amount of academic research conducted within the context of lead
generation and web design is very limited. Out of the various fields mentioned, eservicescapes and how they relate to service quality was one of the few fields that had
been properly researched in academic context and did not focus on lead generation, but
on purchase intentions withing e-commerce. However, parallels can be drawn between
purchase intentions in e-commerce and conversions in lead generation, as will become
apparent throughout chapter 4 and especially section 4.2.4. The most prominent

16

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

references on conversion design found in the review, were books or guides created by
business practitioners and marketing companies, such as Halligan and Shah (2014),
Blanks and Jesson (2018), Rabhan (2013), Ash (2012), Goward (2013) Rothman (2014)
and Gardner (2018). Other noteworthy references from the academic field would be
Chaffey (2015), Chaffey and Elis-Chadwick (2012), Chaffey and Smith (2013) and Frick
and Eyler-Werve (2015). However, none of the academic references that were found
focus exclusively on conversion design, nor do they treat the subject with the same
importance as the before mentioned authors.
The purpose of the literature review was to develop a deep understanding of conversion
design and through that understanding put forward the hypothesized model of optimal
conversion design and as such it comprises the develop and build stage of this case study
in accordance with the model by Hevner et al (2004). To then perform the justify and
evaluate stage, a qualitative content analysis was performed.
3.1.2 Qualitative content analysis
As was mentioned in section 3.1, the application and testing of the hypothesized model
on the subject page involved developing a new design. To thoroughly analyze the new
design and to highlight the differences between the old design that was not based on the
hypothesized model and the new design in terms of the visual and contextual differences,
a visual analysis had to be performed. The primary data source for this analysis was a
number of screenshots as will be discussed in section 3.2.1. To clearly evaluate the
hypothesized model through the subject webpage and due to the written and visual nature
of the case in question, a qualitative research method was chosen for this part of the case
study as well. The qualitative content analysis constitutes the justify and evaluate stage
of the model by Hevner et al. (2004).
The qualitative content analysis is a technique suitable for analysis of multiple types of
data, such as written and visual data (Saldaña 2013). Websites are exactly that type of
medium, it is a visual presentation of both written text, images, symbols and graphics.
Bryman and Bell (2011, p. 289-91) define content analysis as a way of analyzing printed
or visual documents and texts through predetermined categories in a very systematic and
replicable manner. This consistent approach aids in suppressing possible bias and is not
very focused on generating data, rather it outlines an approach to how data (texts and
17

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

documents) can be interpreted. As such, content analysis can be used to analyze many
different types of media and is especially applicable to various types of unstructured
information, such as interviews and qualitative case studies. Websites have also been
known to be a fitting subject of study for the content analysis approach. Duriau, Reger
and Pfarrer (2007) concluded that the content analysis has a lot of potential in relation to
the enormous amount of text, graphic content, audio and video that comprise
organizational and corporate websites.
3.1.3 Mixed methods research
The research done in the literature review defined that theory generating stage of the case
study (develop and build in the model by Hevner et al. (2004)) as being an inductive
approach. However, the evaluation stage of the case study, the content analysis (justify
and evaluate in the model by Hevner et al. (2004)), concerns itself with the testing of the
theory built in the literature review, which according to Bryman and Bell (2012, p. 2627) would classify this part of the study as deductive and consequently as incorporating a
quantitative research method. This is due to the fact that theory testing studies are
specifically considered as quantitative. However, the data collected and interpreted in the
content analysis, the screenshots, are a qualitative and not a quantitative data source.
Additionally, the research design itself based on the model by Hevner et al. (2004) and
with influences from Järvinen (2012) and March and Smith (1995) can also be considered
a deductive approach on the holistic level. Namely, the process of deduction is as follows;
(1) theory, (2) hypothesis, (3) data collection, (4) findings, (5) hypothesis confirmed or
rejected and (6) revision of theory (Bryman & Bell 2011, p. 11), which is very much in
line with the research design and structure of this case study. Furthermore, to actually
measure if the hypothesized model had facilitated the aim of the study, in other words, if
the new design had any tangible effect on the number of generated leads, the case study
had to consider some quantitative data in addition to the qualitative data. The quantitative
data mainly consisted of the conversion rate of the subject page.
All of the above combined with the fact that the study is a case study incorporating both
a literature review and a content analysis classifies this study holistically as a mixed
methods research. This approach occurs when the researcher cannot rely on only one
research strategy alone, such as a qualitative or quantitative one, but must validate the
18

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

research findings with a method from the other strategy (Bryman & Bell 2011, p. 636).
Bryman and Bell (2011), Yin (2009) and Järvinen (2012) also speak for the usage of
mixed methods research as they advocate the usage of both qualitative and quantitative
data in the same study to produce better results. The usage of multiple data sources that
come about from a mixed methods research is usually referred to as triangulation, which
will be explained in more detail in the following section. The study can however be said
to incorporate a deductive research design into a predominantly qualitative research
method fueled by primary data of a qualitative nature. The study also utilizes quantitative
data as secondary data to further confirm or reject the conclusions drawn through the
qualitative research. The priority therefore lies on qualitative research while the
quantitative data is used in sequence as per Bryman and Bell’s (2011, p. 632)
classification of mixed methods research approaches.

3.2 Data Collection and analysis
If possible, both qualitative and quantitative data should be used in any case study as the
need for using multiple sources of evidence is much greater than in other research
methods (Yin, 2018, p. 127). Combination of multiple data points further enhances the
reliability of the results and is referred to as triangulation. Triangulation is the procedure
of observing a research issue from at least two different points (Flick, von Kardoff &
Steinke 2004, p. 178) and enables researchers to cross-check their findings from one
research strategy against the findings from a method belonging to another research
strategy (Bryman & Bell 2011, p. 397). The benefit of triangulation is that data collected
through different means and from different sources produce a wider scope of coverage
and may result in a more complete picture of the phenomenon of interest (Järvinen 2012,
p. 75). Yin (2009, p. 97-101) also argues that case studies must address multiple data
sources in order to prove facts.
However, qualitative data is the dominant data that theory-testing research concerns itself
with (Järvinen 2012, p. 75). In this study, the qualitative primary data consisted of existing
research, theories and business methods for the literature review, but also of screenshots
of the subject webpage. Sequentially, the quantitative secondary data was gathered from
Google Analytics through a sequential A/B split test.

19

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

3.2.1 Qualitative primary data - screenshots
Screenshots worked as the primary data for analyzing the design of subject webpage.
Screenshots were taken before and after the implementation of the hypothesized model.
Primary data is data explicitly collected by the researcher for the specific purpose of
addressing the research problem (Malhotra 2007, p. 42). The screenshots constituted the
visual documents of qualitive content analysis as defined by Bryman and Bell (2011, p.
289) in section 3.1.1. The reason for choosing screenshots as the primary data is simple,
it is the only way to visually analyze a webpage, other than doing it live in the Internet
browser. The latter was not possible for the old design as the live webpage was changed
to the new design before the analysis could be made, which left screenshots as the only
viable option.
The screenshots of both the old and the new design were taken at the same screen
resolution of 1920 x 1080 because this was the most frequently used screen resolution on
website visitors’ devices (see appendix C). Google Chrome was the Internet browser of
choice for the visitors by a clear majority (see appendix E), so all screenshots were taken
in this specific browser. Additionally, irregularities in how webpages are displayed are
common between browsers, so taking all screenshots in Google Chrome made sure no
such irregularities interfered with the research. However, the possibility of such
irregularities does raise questions about the reliability of the results of the study when
only one Internet browser is taken into consideration although in reality, multiple
browsers are used for accessing the case-company’s website. However, the differences
that might exist in the design were deemed to be so minimal that it would not have had
any significant effect on the result of the case study.
For both designs, four screenshots were taken. They portray the page itself and the lead
generation form, which is not hosted directly on the page but as an overlay. Three out of
four screenshots are of the lead generation form to show its different states. The form is
an interactive element which means that it changes according to how visitors engage with
it, hence the different states. All screenshots of both the old and the new design can be
viewed in appendix F and G, respectively. The screenshots of the old design where taken
22.02.2019 and the screenshots of the new design where taken 08.05.2019. The design of
the subject page was updated on the 25th of February 2019.

20

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

The issue with using screenshots as a primary data source is that they are static, while
webpages mostly are dynamic and always include some level of interactivity. Visual data
in general has been known to be more difficult to analyze in content analysis research
when comparing to text documents (Saldaña 2013, p. 52). Despite this, some level of
interactivity was still analyzed in this study, such as the above-mentioned lead generation
form, due to interactivity’s positioning as a key element in conversion design as will
become apparent in chapters 5 and 6.
3.2.2 Coding schedule and coding manual
In order to examine the screenshots and evaluate their design a process of evaluation had
to be created and the screenshots themselves needed to be translated into usable data. In
this study the above was achieved through the process of coding. Coding is a crucial step
in the process of performing content analysis. It requires the researcher to assemble a socalled coding scheme. A content analysis coding scheme consists of two main parts: a
coding schedule and a coding manual (Bryman & Bell 2011, p. 299).
To understand coding, one must first understand the definition of code in this context.
Saldaña (2013, p. 3) defines code in content analysis as the following; “A code in
qualitative inquiry is most often a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a
summative, salient, essence-capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of
language-based or visual data”. He continues to state that websites are an example of such
visual data. Malhotra et al. (2007, p. 431) states that a code is usually defined as a number
and exemplifies this by explaining that e.g. the sex of respondents in a survey can be
coded with numbers; 1 for females and 2 for males. However as was mentioned in the
previous section, visual data is notoriously difficult to analyze. Therefore, Saldaña (2013,
p. 52) recommends generating language-based data that accompany the visual data, he
summarizes that researchers must use words to articulate their “take” on visual data. Due
to this fact, this study used words, phrases and whole sentences to evaluate the
screenshots, the screenshots being the visual data referenced above.
The coding scheme been stated to be the main reason as to why content analysis can be
considered a safe research methodology. Namely because the coding scheme can be
corrected if flaws are detected as the study progresses (Tallerico, 1991; Woodrum, 1984
in Duriau et al. 2007, p. 7). The coding scheme and mainly the coding manual is what
21

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

allows for the systematic approach of content analysis as described in previous sections.
The coding manual essentially defines a set of rules or instructions so that the gathered
data, i.e. code, can be categorized into reasonable groups for practical interpretation
(Malhotra 2007, p. 431-433). In other words, the coding schedule is what the researcher
uses to document the analysis findings based on the rules set in the coding manual. To
further understand the concept of coding, Järvinen (2012, p. 71) offers a very
understandable explanation; within qualitative research, “coding is the process of
analyzing data”.
The coding manual used in this study was based on the hypothesized model presented in
section 5.5, it was thus built on the dimensions depicted in the hypothesized model. See
appendix H for the coding manual. The evaluation of the screenshots was documented in
two separate coding schedules, one for each version of the design of the subject page,
these can be viewed in appendices I and J. In this manner the analysis of the subject page
combined language-based data (the coding schedules) with visual data (the screenshots)
as per Saldaña’s recommendation above.
3.2.3 Quantitative secondary data - Google Analytics
The main difference between qualitative and quantitative research is that qualitative
approaches focus on providing insights and understanding of the problem at hand, while
quantitative approaches seek to quantify data and apply a statistical analysis. Scholars and
advocates of both approaches have been known throughout history to quarrel and debate
about which one is better, while in fact the combination of both can generate more reliable
results and provide valuable insights that can help in creating successful marketing
strategies (Malhotra 2007, p. 143). Yin (2018, p. 126) explains that many case studies
have relied on a single source of evidence but also states that a single-source approach is
not recommended in case study research. He argues that the opportunity to use different
data sources is one of the most significant strengths of case study data collection. This is
the process of triangulation as discussed in the preceding sections.
The characteristics of the two approaches determine the type of data collected, the
quantifiable and statistical nature of quantitative research means that quantitative data
consists of numbers, while qualitative data can consist of text, documents and visual data
as has been discussed.
22

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

In contrast to primary data, secondary data consists of data that is collected for another
purpose than the problem at hand (Malhotra 2007, p. 42). The secondary data, when
compared to primary data, is in addition to the above; easy and rapid to collect, has a low
collection cost and a short collection time (Malhotra 2007, p. 107). In this case study the
quantitative secondary data consisted in its entirety of numerical data from the tool
Google Analytics. The main data collected was the conversion rate of the subject page,
which indicates how many website visitors convert into leads. The conversion rate was
used to determine the effect of the hypothesized model and thus determine the role of
design for the generation of leads. However, other secondary data regarding the subject
page was also used to either support or determine various aspects throughout the study,
such as visitors’ devices, screen resolutions, historical data etc., all secondary data
collected from Google Analytics can be viewed in the appendices. All of the secondary
data has only been collected from the subject page www.hibox.tv/Hotel-TVPlatform.shtml and only from desktop devices, with the exception of the page
performance comparison which includes data from multiple pages (see appendix D).
The subjectivity of the screenshot analysis, although systematically conducted through
the coding schedule, multiplied the importance of the secondary data. The screenshot
analysis was subjected to the personal views of the researcher, meaning it was subjective
in nature. This type of bias was minimized through a proper research design and through
the fact that the coding schedule was based on the hypothesized model, but when e.g.
analyzing a dimension such as aesthetics, it is impossible to entirely eradicate the
subjective views and opinions of the researcher. The only way of doing that would be to
design a coding schedule with set rules of analysis, which was the case in this study,
however, some factors in design are based on personal beliefs and opinions and even
cultural differences, aesthetics being a good example of such a factor. Even though the
subjectivity of the screenshots is a weakness in the design of the case study, not leaving
any room for this subjectivity would limit the study in other ways and might produce a
result that is not representable of the average website visitor. Namely, as the real-world
website visitors are individual human beings with their own subjective views, it would
not be accurate to eliminate the subjective views of the researcher entirely.

3.2.4 A/B split testing and conversion experimentation
For performing an actual test of the designs, a modified A/B split test was performed. As
explained in more detail in section 4.2.5, A/B split testing is common practice in
conversion experimentation (Ash 2012; Goward 2013; Rothman 2014). In this case study
a sequential test was performed, where the old design was replaced by the new and the
difference in conversion rate was assessed over time. Ash (2012, p. 214) recommends
parallel A/B tests over sequential ones, however, parallel testing requires specific tooling
while a sequential test can be done with simple analytics, such as those provided through
Google Analytics (Rothman 2014, p 323; Ash 2012, p. 256). Additionally, the time
constraints of this study where such that the sequential method was deemed more
appropriate.
The model by Hevner et al. (2004, p. 80) presented in section 3.1 manifested the overall
research design of this case study. The sequential A/B split test constituted the assess part
of the model (see figure 4, section 3.1). Therefore, the A/B test combined with the
screenshot analysis were the main tools for evaluating the develop and build stage of the
model, thus making up the justify and evaluate stage. The unique purpose of the A/B test
was as such to either validate or invalidate the hypothesized model.

3.3 Chapter summary
This chapter has described the methodology of this thesis. First of all, it has been
concluded that the thesis in itself manifests as a case study, wherein the phenomenon of
interest was the role of design in the generation of leads in online lead generation,
specifically on websites. The actual case was the corporate website of the case-company
from which one webpage was chosen as the subject of study. The research strategy can
be classified as a mixed methods research as it incorporates a qualitative literature review
and content analysis consisting of qualitative data, while also utilizing quantitative data
to cross-check the findings in the qualitative research.
The thesis’s research design was based on the model by Hevner et al. (2004) and can
roughly be divided into two main stages; a develop and build stage where a hypothesized
model of conversion design was created, and a justify and evaluate stage which task was
to validate or invalidate the hypothesized model. The structure of the research design can

24

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

be considered as a deductive one. The research design also draws on suggestion by
Järvinen’s (2012) theory-testing methodology to complement the model by Hevner et al.
(2004).
In practice, the develop and build stage consisted of an extensive literature review of
existing literature and research that resulted in the hypothesized model. Sequentially, the
justify and evaluate stage was performed by applying a new design on the subject page,
a design that was developed in accordance with the hypothesized model. The old and new
design where then evaluated through a content analysis that analyzed screenshots of the
subject page’s two different designs by the help of a coding schedule that was created for
this purpose. To additionally examine the results from the content analysis and to
establish whether or not the hypothesized model had had any impact on the conversion
rate of the case-company’s website, quantitative data from Google Analytics was
collected and analyzed.

4 LEAD GENERATION FOR B2B MARKETING
The website and online lead generation have been acknowledged as primary enablers for
increasing sales opportunities for the case-company Hibox, and as such have been
acknowledged as the principal subjects of study. The purpose of this chapter is to examine
lead generation in a B2B marketing context and to define which role the website plays in
the lead generation process, as well as what designing for conversion means.

4.1 The evolution of B2B buying behavior and its effect on
marketing
Buying behavior within B2B has changed drastically during the last decade. As with
many aspects of marketing and business in general; globalization, digitization and the
rapid development of the Internet have brought about this change. According to Rothman
(2014, p. 11) B2B marketers used to apply so called outbound marketing techniques to
put marketing content directly in front of buyers to generate leads and sales. These
techniques included advertising, email, TV, radio and print media. These techniques put
the marketers in control of what information buyers were exposed to. Today, the Internet
with its easily accessible information has enabled a power shift in favor of the buyers,
effectively putting the buyers in control of the buying process (Kurvinen & Seppä 2016,
p. 13). Buyers can access an abundance of information at any time of their choosing and
have increased ability to block and ignore traditional outbound techniques through spam
filters and new information sources such as search engines (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 38). Figure 5 depicts a modern B2B buying process with six different stages.
Researchers agree that the Internet has become a significant element for B2B buyers in
the search and evaluation stages of the buying process (stages 3 and 4 in figure 5),
meaning that most buyers today begin the process by researching products and services
online (Adamson, Dixon & Toman 2012, p. 54: Holliman & Rowley 2014, p. 285).
According to Kaye (2014) the majority of B2B buyers begin their buying process by
looking for information with the aid of search engines, and some studies show that as
much as 90 % of buyers use search engines at some point during the buying process
(Snyder & Hilal 2015).

26

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 5: The B2B buying process (Charlesworth 2018, p. 22). Revised.

The increased use of search engines highlights the importance of a functional and
competitive corporate website. Websites are the tool with which companies generate
visibility in search engines and the ultimate source of information that buyers are looking
for. They work as the main marketing communications hub for most digital marketing
efforts. Ryan (2014, p. 44) considers websites to be the most important digital real estate
a business can own, and that eventually all digital marketing activities are channeled back
to this single point. The website’s critical role in the B2B buying process makes it one of
the most important tools for B2B marketers. This has contributed to the development of
new marketing tactics that increase traffic to websites and that increase conversions. The
main marketing model used by marketers today for this purpose is inbound marketing
(Chaffey & Ellis-Chadwick 2012 p. 628).
4.1.1 The rise of inbound marketing
The evolutionary change of the B2B buying process fueled by the technological boom
has given birth to new digitally focused marketing concepts. Inbound marketing and one
of its most prominent sub-components content marketing, focuses on earning their

27

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

customers by providing valuable content and seeing the buyers as part of the value
creation process rather than subjects of marketer-ruled advertisements.
According to Patrutiu-Baltes (2016, p. 66), inbound marketing has the aim of winning the
target audiences’ interest through digital tools, i.e. to draw buyers to products and services
through the conscious decision of the buyers themselves. It is a digital marketing concept
that is performed online through marketing techniques that include content marketing,
SEO, social media marketing and branding. It is also the opposite of traditional outbound
marketing with the very nature of not being as intrusive as the traditional techniques, but
rather attracting buyers through problem recognition and timely solutions of high-quality
content that fulfils either an emotional or useful criterion (Opreana & Vinerean 2015 p.
29-32). In other words, inbound aims to win the targeted buyer’s interest through welltimed content hosted online that the buyers themselves decide to engage with. Inbound is
considered to have a bottoms-up approach to marketing as the focus is for companies to
be found by buyers rather than the companies finding the buyers. Table 1 explains the
main differences between traditional outbound marketing and inbound marketing and
thus gives a good explanation of what inbound is in practice.
The purpose of inbound marketing is to pull buyers towards a business (Avery, Dahod &
Steenburgh 2009, p. 1; Patriutu-Baltes 2016, p. 62; Pateman and Holt 2011, p. 10), and is
largely similar to the concept of pull marketing. However, inbound focuses on the entire
sales cycle while pull is mostly concerned with the traffic generating aspect of inbound.
Yet the adjective pull helps in understanding the tactics of inbound since it describes the
nature of attracting buyers to a company rather than the other way around. Chaffey and
Smith (2013, p. 400) suggest the Internet to be the perfect place for a pull-type marketing
strategy where marketers can pull customers to their website trough search engines and
social media.

Inbound marketing defines a methodology of four pillars, or stages, that describes steps
that marketers need to take in order to move buyers along the sales cycle. The four stages
are attract, convert, close and delight. The sales cycle is geared towards a digital arena as
per the definition of the marketing concept itself. The framework is illustrated in figure
6.
Figure 6: The 4 stages of inbound marketing (Champion 2018; Kurvinen & Seppä 2016,
p. 187). Revised.

29

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

This framework and its stages with their respective outputs is realized through various
marketing techniques and tools. The convert stage describes the act of taking an online
visitor from just a visitor to a sales qualified lead, this stage in the framework embodies
the concept of lead generation on the web, and thus illustrates where in the sales cycle
lead generation primarily takes place. Lead generation, as part of inbound marketing is
on a holistic level also concerned with the generation of traffic to the website, meaning
that lead generation also concerns itself with the attract stage. However, as have been
mentioned throughout, this study focuses on the role of the website in the online lead
generation process, therefore the convert stage is the stage of relevance for the purpose
of this study.
In practice, this stage consists of convincing a buyer to click a call to action (CTA) in a
digital marketing channel that takes the visitor to a dedicated landing page, i.e. a webpage
designed to convert the visitor into a lead (HubSpot 2018).
With regard to the B2B buying process described in section 4.1 and illustrated in figure
5, the inbound marketing framework can be understood as beginning from stage 3 of the
buying process, the research stage (see figure 5). The way in which buyers use the Internet
in the buying process makes lead generation the key objective of modern B2B websites
(Charlesworth 2018, p. 153). The importance of the corporate website can therefore not
be understated. It is a pivotal element of the lead generation process and in turn a
fundamental part of the overall sales strategy of a B2B company.
4.1.2 Lead generation defined
“The true power of inbound marketing lies in its ability to not only stretch the top of your
sales funnel (and pull more people in), but also stretch the middle (get more to convert)”
(Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 109). This is exactly where lead generation comes in,
convincing more website visitors to convert into leads. Rothman (2014, p. 10) explains
lead generation as being the marketing process of capturing and engaging interest in a
service or product with the goal of creating a sales pipeline and eventually new customers.
In practice, this means attracting and converting prospects that have shown interest into
potential customers (Kolowich 2018).
B2B sales is dependent on a long buying process. Buyers are not likely to acquire
something “off-the-shelf” as in B2C. They evaluate options thoroughly before settling on
30

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the provider they feel fits best. Due to this evaluation process, lead generation is essential.
Sellers need to acquire leads, i.e. potential buyers, to be included in the buyers’ evaluation
process, and to be able to affect that process. Due to the way the B2B buying process
works and to the behavior of B2B buyers, the creation of a lead is a requirement for an
actual sale to take place. Therefore, lead generation is a major part of the B2B marketing
and sales mix.
In its simplest form, a lead is the output of a certain marketing activity such as a campaign
or strategy. According to Morey and McCann (1983, p. 196), a lead is the name of a
person or business that can be considered a prime prospect for a company’s product or
service. This definition still holds true today, but in the age of online lead generation,
leads usually consist of contact details rather than just a name. In fact, an email address
or a phone number is far more valuable than just a name, because it allows for easy contact
to the possibly interested buyer.
A company can actively seek to acquire several different types of leads for different
purposes with different tactics. For example, lead generation can be used for list building,
newsletter signups, e-book downloads and gathering sales leads. It can be done through
both online and offline tactics, such as SEO, newsletters, webinars, cold calls, events or
print media (Schultz, Doerr & Frederiksen 2013, p. 195-219). Ultimately, the goal of lead
generation is growth, as mentioned above, yet how the leads are gathered can vary greatly.
For example, visitors can be asked to provide their personal information to sign up for a
webinar or to be allowed to download a free e-book. The most straightforward method
for B2B websites, however, is to persuade visitors of the value proposition so that they
convert into a lead out of interest for the company.
The case-company of this study uses lead generation for the acquisition of sales qualified
leads (hereinafter lead), i.e. a potential customer that has shown interest in the casecompany’s products and services and is therefore susceptible to further marketing and
sales efforts by moving forward in the sales cycle, from the convert to the close stage in
the inbound marketing framework. The wanted outcome for a lead is for the lead to
eventually turn into a paying customer (Shaw 2018).
The case-company’s corporate website that serves as the subject of study for this thesis,
resembles Chaffey’s (2015, p. 17) definition of a service-oriented relationship-building
website. The purpose of such websites is to stimulate purchase and build relationships for
31

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

businesses that sell products that are not suitable for direct online selling. The main
business contribution of these sites is encouragement of offline sales and to generate
leads.
4.1.3 The lead generation website
“If you have to absolutely nail one thing for lead generation success, it is your website”
(Rothman 2014, p. 99). The corporate website is the main online marketing hub for most
businesses where potential buyers come looking for information and in online lead
generation it is the single most powerful conversion engine. The website has essentially
replaced the traditional B2B marketing brochures, catalogues and trade shows with a
digital and dynamic upgrade that is hosted on the Internet (Charlesworth 2018, p. 21).
With regard to a piece of content that presents a business and its services or products,
nothing has really changed. However, the opportunities a website provides compared to
a traditional outbound marketing tool such as a printed brochure are endless.
A website provides marketers with the possibility to measure and develop the user
experience in real-time to provide increased value for their visitors, and marketers have
complete control to tailor brand messaging and other marketing communication elements.
Despite all these obvious benefits, the role the website plays within lead generation is the
most valuable aspect for B2B marketers.
The website is a platform for turning potential sales prospects into leads and is a critical
stage of the inbound marketing sales cycle. It can be defined as a conversion engine for
online traffic, without which all other traffic-generating digital marketing efforts would
be in vain because traffic in itself is worthless (Ryan 2014, p. 35). Traffic needs to be
converted into leads in order to be moved along the sales cycle and create tangible value
for a business, in other words paying customers. Generating leads revolves around the art
and science of conversions, which is to encourage website visitors to convert from visitor
to lead. This is done by helping visitors take a predefined action on the website; in most
B2B lead generation cases visitors convert by submitting their contact information
through a lead generation form (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 109: Rabhan 2013, p. 38). The
conversion rate is the proportion of visitors that convert into leads and is usually
represented as a percentage. Figure 7 depicts the conversion rate and the website
conversion process.
32

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 7: The website conversion process (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 42).

Providing visitors with a website that fulfils their requirements and piques their interest
however is not easy. It can take a visitor as little as 50 milliseconds to judge whether to
stay on the site or just exit without viewing any more pages on the site, also known as
bouncing (Lindgaard, Fernandes, Dudek & Brown 2006). According to Frick and EylerWerve (2015, p. 184) 47 % of visitors also expect a page to load in two seconds or less,
additionally emphasizing the importance of creating a good first impression. The
abundance of information available to the buyers makes them very critical to what content
they deem worthy. Even if visitors decide to stay on the site, they have the option of
navigating away at any given moment if they lose interest. This provides challenges for
lead generation websites since visitors are constantly one click away from abandoning
the site, meaning that they can bounce at any stage of the sales funnel. This phenomenon
is illustrated in figure 8.
The contemporary sales funnel in figure 8 can be considered to represent a website, it is
also an alternative presentation of the B2B buying process (see figure 5). Visitors can
enter the funnel at any stage depending on if they e.g. enter the homepage first, or a
subpage deeper in the funnel. They might also arrive at the site with the intention of
converting and therefore jump directly into the purchase stage, or they might still be in
either the search or evaluation phases of the buying process and arrive at the website at
the beginning of the funnel. Also, the traffic source from which the visitor is arriving, and
a range of other elements affect at which stage of the funnel and buying process the visitor
enters the site (Charlesworth 2018, p. 121-123). Important to understand is that visitors
can exit and enter the funnel at any stage, as figure 8 shows. Marketers must therefore
33

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

carefully consider how the website is tailored towards these different scenarios and
various user needs, as well as give clear incentives for visitors as they are guided towards
conversion through the funnel.
Figure 8: A contemporary sales funnel (Charlesworth 2018, p. 122). Revised.

The number of possible exits combined with the short attention span of website visitors
also highlights the fact that grabbing the visitors’ attention already at the point of entry
(the first page they see) is of utmost importance, preferably one page would be enough to
convince a visitor to convert no matter where in the funnel they are. This means that the
visual perception a visitor experiences is a deciding factor in the conversion process.
Charlesworth (2018, p. 21) confirms the hypothesis above by stating that “The B2B
website has the key objective of lead generation – making the presentation of information
an essential element.” This highlights the fact that the visual elements combined with the
presented information will affect whether the visitors convert or not. It can be concluded
that as the corporate website has become a powerful tool for B2B marketers and a major
part of the B2B buying process, the two most important elements of lead generation
websites are the content visitors see on the site and the presentation of this content, in
other words the visual design. There are many design principles to consider when
developing lead generation websites. The remainder of this chapter will focus on
presenting the most important design methods for increasing conversions through design.

34

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

4.2 Conversion design
The previous sections have defined the corporate website’s importance within B2B
markets, and it can be summarized that the website is; a major part of the buying process,
a central channel for all digital marketing communications, the best online conversion
tool today, a crucial part of online lead generation, and most importantly; that the design
and content presented on the website is a deciding factor in the conversion process.
Throughout this study, the term conversion design will be used as an umbrella term for
all conversion related web design practices, all of which will be described in the following
section. Conversion design therefore refers to the practice of developing websites with
the aim of increasing conversion rates. The term itself was chosen as there are many
different design methods and frameworks marketers must consider when designing for
conversions as will became apparent in the remainder of this chapter, so to illustrate the
combination of these different design approaches a term was needed. Conversion design
was chosen by the researcher due to its holistic angle and it is not a widely used term by
practitioners.
As the Internet has evolved, so has the design and usage of websites. Initially visual
design was a secondary objective in developing websites, after which they evolved into
the commercial space where aesthetic design was so important that it often outshined
usability. With the rise of the search engines website development focused mainly on
creating search engine friendly sites that rank well. Today SEO is still a major element of
web design, and visual design combined with usability are the main focus areas for most
websites. However, websites are often made for the companies making them, rather than
for the visitors using them, as mentioned in previous sections. Modern, result-driven
websites should be developed from a user point of view, with visual design and usability
being complemented by content and conversions. Customer-centric web design is still
surprisingly rare because most web designers either focus on what management thinks
looks best or what their clients, i.e. other companies, think looks the best (Gofman,
Moskowitz & Metz 2009, p. 286; Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 35). Obviously, design and
usability are mandatory. A beautiful design combined with an easily navigated site
provide for a pleasing user experience, but it is arguable that a functional design that
focuses on providing customer-oriented content and a clear path for conversion generates
measurable growth in sales as well as a good user experience, while e.g. an aesthetically
35

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

appealing site alone would not have the same effect on sales growth (Blanks & Jesson
2018, p. 35-37).
Essentially, a user-centric design approach is needed because a website that simply looks
great can only go so far. A good lead generation website needs to have a healthy
combination of lead generation tactics, good design and usability to facilitate maximum
conversions (Rothman 2014, p. 99-101).
The Power Law of CRO
Conversion design is a sales growth activity with a long run focus. By optimizing the
main conversion engine (the corporate website) for a higher number of conversions, the
number of leads will grow which in turn will increase the number of sales and the
company’s revenue. One could think of conversion design as one of the most important
business tasks of a web-based business, or a business that uses the Internet as a main tool
for lead generation, such as the case-company Hibox. In fact, Blanks and Jesson (2018),
authors of Making Websites Win and founders of the company Conversion Rate Experts
present a framework they call: The Power Law of CRO. CRO meaning Conversion Rate
Optimization which is a term they have coined but is synonymous to conversion design,
see section 4.2.2. The Power Law illustrates the achievable sales growth that conversion
design facilitates (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 51-56).
It builds upon three benefits as a result from higher conversion rates that together
facilitates a disproportionate increase in profit; (1) increase in customers results in an
increase of revenue, (2) generating higher conversion rates do not require significant
financial investment, meaning that it results in a greater profit increase than many other
marketing activities, and (3) with increased profit, marketers have more funding which
can be allocated towards increasing traffic to the website and the three benefits repeat
themselves. The process of these benefits is illustrated in figure 9 below.
Testing is the “gold standard”
Designing for conversion is also about experimentation. Testing different variants of a
webpage to see which one converts the best and has the highest level of interaction from
its visitors is a fundamental part of conversion design. It is an iterative design process,
which in practice means measuring various KPI’s and adjusting the webpage accordingly.
By tracking the actions (or inactions) of your visitors when they visit a certain version of

36

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

a webpage, you can reliable determine what they prefer, testing is therefore the “gold
standard” of conversion improvement (Ash, Ginty & Page 2012, p. 66)
Figure 9: The power law of CRO (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 51-56).

For lead generation websites the main KPI is normally the conversion rate (Saleh &
Shukairy 2011, p. 10). Experimenting with new elements continuously is essential for
improving the conversion rate because it is next to impossible to know beforehand what
a specific group of website visitors will interact the best with, it is a sort of trial and error
process.
Where to begin when trying to design for conversions can be a daunting task because
there are many concepts within marketing literature that touch on the subject of lead
generation and web design, and when marketers need to provide for aesthetics, usability,
conversion and customer-oriented design it becomes even more complex. These concepts
must be laid out so that the actual conversion boosting elements of a webpage can be
identified. The following sections of this chapter will aim to briefly go through the main
web design and marketing concepts that play a role in conversion design.
4.2.1 User-centered design
User-centered design (UCD) is a design approach that puts the user in the forefront of the
design process. It considered the users’ needs, desires and perspectives as primary drivers
for designing (Ash 2008, p. 60). On the corporate website, this greatly involves supplying
37

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the users with the right information and answering their questions, but in addition to that
it is very much about functionality. From a visitor’s perspective, a functioning website is
the prerequisite for engagement. For example, if a website simply does not function the
way it was intended to or hinders the visitors from reaching a goal through a technical
error, it will mostly likely experience high bounce rates and close to no engagement.
Visitors that have a bad experience on the website might never return and it will also
damage their image of the brand behind the website. These examples highlight the two
main subjects of user-centered design: usability and accessibility (Chaffey & Smith 2013,
p. 291).
Usability
Usability can be thought of as the baseline for web design, a web site with poor usability
will not convert its visitors no matter how many conversion boosting elements marketers
try to apply. In fact, poor usability can have dire consequences because research suggests
that visitors’ likelihood to ever engage with a company is highly dependent on the
visitors’ experience on the corporate website and as many as 75 % of visitors say they
judge the credibility of a company based on the website’s design (Loveday & Niehaus
2008, p. 1). Usability describes how easy a service or product is to use. The underlying
premise is to help the visitor in achieving his or her goal by providing a smooth humancomputer interaction. Chaffey and Smith (2012, p. 291-292) describe three characteristics
for usability of Internet platforms:
•

Effectiveness: The accuracy and completeness with which specified users can
achieve specified goals in particular environments.

•

Efficiency: The resources expanded in relation to the accuracy and completeness
of goals achieved.

•

Satisfaction: The comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and
other people affected by its use.

To satisfy all these characteristics web designers focus on creating seamless navigation,
clear page structures, appealing visuals and consistency in their designs. Often websites
can create a negative user experience thanks to lacking usability. If the visitor gets
confused by an overwhelming and unclear information structure or gets lost in poor
navigation, the visitor is unlikely to engage with the company.

38

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Historically, B2B websites have been known to have poor usability. The Nielsen Norman
group, acknowledged experts in the field of user experience research on websites and web
applications (Nielsen Norman Group 2019), found in a study (Nielsen 2006) that many
B2B sites emphasize internally focused design, meaning that they fail to deliver an
appealing user experience and fail to answer the visitors’ main questions. Even today this
is the norm for corporate websites. However, companies that do not experience a direct
return on investment from web usability, in contrast with ecommerce sites for example,
are beginning to realize the benefit of good UX (Nielsen 2018).
Accessibility
Accessibility does not require as much theoretical explanation as its counterpart usability,
but it is no less important for user-centered design. Web designers and marketers should
design websites so that they are equally accessible by all users from all relevant platforms,
such as desktop, mobile and different web browsers. Users with disabilities need to be
considered, especially visually impaired or blind users. Logical website structures and
clear labelling makes the site easier to navigate, for both visually impaired and nonimpaired users. Many users with sight-disabilities also use screen-readers to navigate the
web which means that sites must be optimized for this purpose (Chaffey & Smith 2013,
p. 293-294).
Beyond usability and accessibility
Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 282), when discussing user-centered design, accessibility
and usability, state that commercial site design is based on creating persuasive and
compelling experiences that drive engagement from visitors through relevant messages
and content that encourages them to stay on the site and return in the future. Also,
according to Bevan (1999 cited in Chaffey 2015, p. 538) a website must meet the needs
of the visitors to meet the needs of the organization. In accordance with these statements,
web design must be user-centric and aim to answer all the questions visitors might have,
user-centered design can be considered as synonymous to user experience (Chaffey 2015,
p. 538). This goes beyond the practices of merely creating a seamless technical experience
which has been the dominating motivator behind web design for quite some time. Of
course, these factors are still of significance today, but they are prerequisites rather than
differentiators. For generation Y users for example, aesthetics has been shown to be very
important and usability has been shown to be taken for granted (Djamasbi, Siegel & Tulis
39

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

2010, p. 309). Non-functional sites are simply not tolerated by visitors because there is
always an alternative site or company they can turn to.
Frick and Eyler-Werve (2015, p. 171) describe that a website must follow professional
design standards that portray credibility, reliability, expertise and consistency and that
this type of credibility-based design is the number one factor for increasing conversions
through design. They define the four criteria of credibility-based design as:
1. Site speed: a website must have quick load times.
2. Reliability: No broken pages, spelling mistakes or similar errors can be present
on the site.
3. Attractiveness: The visual design must be appealing and support the content on
the site.
4. Ease-of-use: Good usability and navigation are required to make content easily
findable.
If either one of these criteria are not met than the site in question will most likely lose part
of its visitors. The delivery of a superior user experience has evolved to be more complex
than just creating a functional website. A truly user-centric website that can deliver results
incorporates conversion and business goals into the design, aligns these goals with those
of the visitors and leverages basic accessibility and usability best practices.
4.2.2 Conversion rate optimization
When discussing design from a conversion perspective there are two terms one generally
comes across. Conversion-centered design (CCD) and conversion rate optimization
(CRO) are essentially two terms for the same practice, which is designing websites for
the main purpose of conversion. Both can be thought of as the same concept and are often
used interchangeably by marketers, in this and the following chapter, the term CRO will
be used when describing either of these. There is also a third concept called landing page
optimization (LPO) that at its core is very similar to CRO due to the fact that both share
the same end goal. LPO will be discussed in the following section.
Conversion rate optimization is the art of persuasion that delivers commercial results
(Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 284). It is the practice of convincing a visitor to take a
predefined action that results in a conversion (Blanks & Jesson 2018; Rabhan 2013; Saleh
40

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

& Shukairy 2011). In online lead generation scenarios this action usually consists of
completing a form as described in section 4.1.3. Blanks and Jesson (2018, p. 51) also
define CRO as web design done right and as the framework that helps a webpage achieve
its goal, whether that is to sell, generate leads, generate signups or downloads, or
something else. CRO can be applied to any webpage in any industry.
At its core it is a user-centric approach just as UCD, because it focuses on how the visitors
can be persuaded to convert, and in order to convert the visitors must be pleased with the
experience and information they receive on the website. Therefore, CRO is highly
concerned with the user experience a website offers. Everything that constitutes good
user-design and was described in the previous section is also considered good conversion
design. It is next to impossible to convince a B2B buyer visiting a webpage to convert if
e.g. the usability of that page is of low quality.
One could say that user-centered design alone is not as evolved or effective as conversion
rate optimization. CRO applies additional levels of optimization that benefit both the
visitor and the company behind the website. While most websites are designed for beauty,
CRO favors functionality over aesthetics. Meaning that a neat looking design is important
but unless that design is geared toward supporting both the visitors and the company’s
goals, or fails to do so, beautiful visuals are futile (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 67).
Apart from functionality, one other distinct characteristic of CRO is that it aims to achieve
the marketer’s goal rather than the visitor’s goal. Take the definition of a conversion as
presented by Gardner (2018, p. 1-11) as an example; from a usability perspective that a
lot of non-CRO designers adhere to, a conversion might be a visitor completing a set of
predefined tasks in a flow of micro-conversions such as an ecommerce checkout process.
Here the aim is to make the flow of tasks as easy and as pain free as possible for the visitor
and thus, helping the user complete his or her goal, i.e. to go through the checkout process.
With a CRO-design approach however, the mindset is different. Firstly, the aim is to make
the visitor complete one task only as opposed to several tasks. Secondly, this task is a
purely business-driven action such as converting into a lead, meaning that the focus is not
on making the process itself as easy as possible, but creating a persuasive experience that
makes sure the visitor converts and thus completes the marketer’s goal. The intuitiveness
of the process is definitely important, but it is not the main focus.

41

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Compared to most design frameworks, CRO is defined as sales-driven practice since it
concerns itself with increasing conversion as others do not. The financial benefits of
designing for conversion can also be easily measured, whereas other aspects of web
design do not generate direct and measurable business value. To achieve higher
conversion rates, CRO combines many tools and techniques of which measurement is the
key controller. As will be explained in section 4.2.5, decisions that are taken in CRO are
based on research and analysis of the user experience on the corporate website. The
statement that CRO concerns itself with achieving the marketer’s goal exclusively, as was
stated earlier, is not entirely true. The marketer’s and the business goals are the motivation
behind optimizing for conversions, but when that optimization is based on detailed
measurement of what visual elements and what type of content visitors want to engage
with, CRO achieves the visitor’s goals simultaneously.
Whereas user-centered design focuses mainly on usability and aesthetical aspects such as
navigation, color and layout, CRO focuses on symbols, imagery, contrast, call to action,
forms, engaging copy and placement of these elements. So called persuasive design
combined with psychological triggers are used as devices to increase conversions
(Gardner 2018, p. 4). CRO can be adapted to any type of webpage; product pages, home
pages or even blog posts, but at the heart of conversion design sits the landing page. Just
as UCD embodies usability and accessibility in CRO, landing page optimization, or LPO,
embodies the persuasive design part of CRO.
4.2.3 Landing page optimization
Landing page optimization focuses on conversion design for a specific type of webpage.
The landing page is a term used for a type of page that is specifically designed to receive
traffic from a predefined source and convert this traffic into leads. In its purest form it
can be any page a visitor lands on but within marketing it is usually a page designed with
a single business-driven objective in mind and built around one call to action that is the
enabler for said business objective (Unbounce 2018).
It is a one-stop conversion page and can even be hosted on a separate site and not on a
company’s main website. These types of landing pages are usually created as part of a
marketing campaign our outreach program, e.g. as the destination of an advertisement in
a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign. Despite building on similar principles, there is one major
42

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

difference between LPO and CRO that affects the design: their purpose. Landing pages
are meant to receive targeted traffic. In the aforementioned PPC campaign for example,
the visitor would already have clicked on an advertisement showing their interest in the
product or service. This allows more targeted messaging and better optimization of the
landing page itself, giving marketers a greater possibility of convincing the visitor to
convert compared to other pages on a website that receives more untargeted traffic
(Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 109-124). Other pages must therefore try to facilitate for a
larger audience than a landing page, a highly targeted page for untargeted traffic is not
likely to convert very well.
Due to the interruptive push nature of the marketing techniques that utilize landing pages,
LPO could be considered to be a part of outbound marketing rather than inbound
marketing. PPC for example is an outbound technique that is used in search engine
marketing. However, landing page techniques can also be applied to keyword-targeted
pages which draw organic traffic through the practice of SEO, which in turn is classified
as inbound marketing. Despite their categorization in marketing methodology, LPO and
CRO have a lot of crossovers and are essentially two concepts of the same technique, just
applied in different scenarios. LPO can be considered to be a part of CRO because CRO
does not limit itself to a specific type of webpage but is rather a complete concept for
generating more conversions on the web.
In landing page optimization, the so-called AIDA model developed by Elias St. Elmo
Lewis in 1989 is often applied. The AIDA model is a sales funnel framework that website
visitors are said to progress through in sequence, ending in conversion (Ash et al. 2012,
p. 39). When applied to a landing page, visitors go through all the stages of the funnel on
the same page.
The acronym AIDA stands for:
•

Awareness (or Attention)

•

Interest

•

Desire (or Decision)

•

Action

The Action stage is where the actual conversion takes place and Ash (2008, p. 68) states
that this is where the design of the landing page plays the most important role, especially
43

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

when there is an absence of any other physical or virtual interaction between the company
and the visitor, which is often the case on lead generation websites.
As the landing page manages to capture attention and interest, which it must do in the
first milliseconds as described in section 4.1.3, the elements on the page must stimulate
desire and action in the visitor to ultimately result in a conversion (Chaffey & EllisChadwick 2012, p. 453). In other words, the landing page needs to satisfy all the stages
of the AIDA model to result in a conversion, at least theoretically. Where the visitor is in
the buying process also makes a key difference and the page as whole must therefore
speak to different types of buyers. However, landing pages are generally made for
targeted traffic from a specific marketing activity, so the filtering of buyers might also be
done in an earlier stage making the page targeted to a specific type of buyer in a specific
stage of the buying process, as mentioned above.
According to Leake, Vaccarello and Ginty (2012, p. 141) a landing page must follow
expected conventions and resonate with the targeted customer segment, and social and
psychological signposts that indicate that the presented service or product is the best
possible choice must be applied. By social and psychological signposts, the authors refer
to visual ques in form of both imagery and text that provokes certainty and trust in the
visitors on the website. For landing pages, the main conversion point, i.e. the call to action
is the most important element that visitors should be guided towards with these ques.
Evidently web design has been studied from various perspectives and there are several
schools of thought on how optimal web design is performed. In practice, what approach
a company should take with their website is largely dependent on the company’s business
objectives. Within lead generation for example focus is on usability and conversion
design which is normally associated with the inbound marketing concept. However, there
are other fields of marketing that have had a significant impact on conversion design. One
such field that of services marketing.
4.2.4 E-servicecapes and service quality
For mainly web-based businesses or companies that perform the majority of their
marketing communications online, the corporate website might be the only interaction a
visitor has with a business before converting or committing to a purchase. More often
than not it is also the first point of communication between buyer and seller, as the buyer
44

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

finds the provider in the research phase of the buying process. The website essentially
replaces the physical interaction that takes place in a traditional bricks and mortar
business which limits the possibilities to influence the potential buyer. Therefore, the
experience the visitor has on the website and the overall service quality of this experience
is very important for increasing conversions.
The field of services marketing concerns itself with assessing the total perceived service
quality a customer experiences when interacting with the service provider. Grönroos
(1982, cited in Santos 2003, p. 234) describes total service quality as being the customer’s
perception of the difference in expected service and the perceived service. Parasuraman,
Zeithaml and Berry (1988, p. 15) further developed service quality by defining it as the
consumer’s judgement and evaluation of a service’s overall superiority in comparison
with its competitors. It is highly related to customer satisfaction and the perceived quality
results from a comparison of customer expectations and actual performance.
Services delivered through websites are considered as so-called e-services, i.e. services
delivered digitally and normally online. The website itself forms an e-servicescape. There
are various types of e-services, but in this study the e-servicescape refers solely to
websites. The term servicescape derives from the physical environment in which a
customer receives a service. The servicescape has a significant impact on the consumer’s
perceived service quality (Grönroos 2008). The actual interaction between seller and
buyer during which the service is delivered is called the service encounter. In the case of
e-servicescapes, a more accurate interpretation of the service encounter is the interaction
between the website visitor and the website, where the visitor is the buyer and the website
represents the seller. The service encounter is a critical moment within the service
delivery process (Bitner, Brown & Meuter 2000) and for websites and other eservicescapes that lack the physical ability of explaining a value proposition in person,
the service encounter takes on even greater proportions. The interaction is between the
user and a digital system and is, therefore, a sort of self-service encounter (Lovelock &
Wirtz 2011). The self-service nature of websites means that the website must be able to
facilitate an adequate user experience and deliver a high service quality on its own, in
other words through design.
E-services rely in part on other quality dimensions than the physical servicescape because
the encounter is almost completely visual, between user and screen. The lack of personnel

45

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

and the virtual nature affects how the user interacts with the service. In comparison with
traditional servicescapes, factors such as usability, appealing visual design and
comprehensive user interfaces have been found to be prominent determinants of quality
in e-servicescapes (Grönroos, Heinonen, Isoniemi, & Lindholm 2000).
Service quality has been proven to be a key factor between success and failure in eservices and especially e-commerce (Yang 2001, cited in Santos 2003, p. 234).
Furthermore, it has been found that service quality and customer satisfaction are key
elements in forming purchase intentions (Taylor & Baker 1994, p. 163). A variety of
frameworks for assessing service quality has been created of which the SERVQUAL
framework developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988) has been regarded as the most
prominent (Yang, Jun & Peterson 2004, p. 1151). The framework, originally created in
1985, consisted of ten dimensions but was simplified to the five dimensions tangibles,
reliability, responsibility, assurance and empathy (Parasuraman et al. 1988). These
dimensions work as measurement devices of service quality. Despite the considerable
recognition of the SERVQUAL framework as a tool for assessing service quality, it has
been found not to be adequate for assessing the service quality of websites, because the
five dimensions are primarily geared towards customer-to-employee interactions (Yang
et al. 2004, p. 1151), which is not applicable in the digital arena that mainly consists of
human-to-computer interactions.
New models have been created to facilitate assessment of the service quality of digital
services. Among these are e.g. Webqual by Loiacono, Watson and Goodhue (2007) and
E-S-QUAL by Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Malhotra (2005). Both of these tools, similarly
to the SERVQUAL, define various dimensions and determinants for increased service
quality and provide good insight into how designers should develop websites for
increased conversions.
Most models for measuring e-service quality have been developed through extensive user
testing wherein visitors evaluate websites so that researchers can determine which
dimensions they seem to value and what the determinants these dimensions consist of.
Most models share both dimensions and determinants but differ in balancing the
importance and naming of these factors. “Service quality is an elusive and abstract
construct that is difficult to explain and measure” (Lee & Lin 2005, p. 161) which is no

46

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

doubt due to the fact that all people evaluate websites differently, as they have different
expectations of quality and different requirements.
However, marketers can draw valuable insights and conclusions from studying existing
models, as they all mostly share the same characteristics. Trust, for example, is considered
by researchers to be a major determinant for e-service quality, as first suggested by
Gummesson (1979, cited in Santos 2003, p. 234). According to Harris and Goode (2010,
p. 230), trust between buyer and supplier is the single most important element for
increasing purchase intentions on websites. They also provide a conceptual model of
which factors are the most important in creating trust, and consequently, increasing
purchase intentions. The model and its various factors are portrayed in figure 10.
Figure 10: A conceptual model of e-servicescapes, trust and purchase intentions (Harris
& Goode 2010, p. 232). Revised.

Other researchers also recognize the importance of trust but do not necessarily consider
it the single most important element for increased conversion or purchase intentions,
rather as one of many dimensions (Loiacono et al. 2007; Lee & Lin 2005; Yang et al.
2004; Zeithaml et al. 2005). Similarly to Harris and Goode (2010), Santos (2003) also
presents a conceptual framework for measuring e-service quality. Santos’s model
includes eleven quality determinants divided between two categories that she calls the
incubative dimension and the active dimension. The incubative dimension deals with the
website’s design, while the active dimension is defined as support, speed and
maintenance. This categorization is based upon time, where the incubative dimension is
47

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

related to quality determinants relevant before the website is launched and the active
dimension is related to determinants relevant after launch (Santos 2003, p. 238-243).
Santos’s model and its quality determinants is depicted in table 2. Parallels can be drawn
between Santos’s incubative and active dimensions and UCD and CRO. The incubative
dimension mainly concerns itself with similar elements as UCD, while the elements in
the active dimensions are similar to important elements within CRO.

Other researchers propose similar models for web development with regard to enhancing
the service quality of e-servicescapes. Abels, White and Hahn (1998) developed six userbased design criteria for websites which were: use, content, structure, linkage, search and
appearance. Yang (2001), in turn, presented reliability, responsiveness, access, ease of
use, attentiveness, credibility and security as main dimensions for e-service quality.
All models briefly presented here, as well as other models not included in this section,
provide valuable insight into how website visitors evaluate their experience. The
importance service quality has for conversions and the challenges this importance
develops for e-servicescapes, such as the corporate website, requires insights into which
elements website visitors consider in their evaluation of e-service quality (Yang et al.
2004, p. 1150). Which elements should be applied in the design of a conversion-centered
website is what chapter 4 will aim to decipher by taking a deeper look into the specific

48

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

on-page elements that can be used to increase service quality and conversions, but first
one crucial element of conversion design must be clarified, namely the art of
improvement through measurement.
4.2.5 Measuring conversion design
“Conversion optimization analyses the behaviour of consumers, focuses on what
motivates a particular market segment to react in a certain way to marketing
elements and advises companies on how to adjust their marketing and sales mix
in response” (Saleh & Shukairy 2011, p. 2).

As the previous quote states and as was briefly outlined in section 4.2, conversion design
is mainly about experimentation and measurement of those experiments. The techniques
defined so far in this dissertation are therefore not guaranteed to succeed. However, they
are proven methods that scholars and businesses alike have proven to be efficient, but
every website and market segment is different. This case study can be defined as a
conversion design experiment in itself; it analyses the best practices in the field, applies
them on the corporate website and finally measures if the implemented techniques have
had any significant effect. If the results were to be negative, then that does not directly
indicate that the effort has been in vain. Rather it indicates that some elements were not
exactly right for the relevant market segment. So, the experiment continues with a new
round of experimentation and testing to find the best converting version, because that is
what conversion design is. Once a website has been designed with a user-centric
conversion mindset it will also become easier to test and tweak smaller elements that
require less effort from the marketer, thanks to the fact that the groundwork has already
been laid. As Leake et al. (2012, p. 141) puts it: “The more recent CRO, or landing page
optimization, is based on carefully isolating and testing elements of a webpage to provoke
more conversions”.
Albeit the underlining goal of marketers is lead generation and profit increase, conversion
design tests the user experience of websites, while profit increase and other financial
measures is the result of that testing. The premise is to understand what visitors engage
with on a page. The most commonly used and recommended methods of conversion
experimentation and testing is A/B split testing and multivariate testing (Rothman 2014,
p. 321-323).

49

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

According to Ash et al. (2012, p. 331), A/B split testing is the most basic version of
conversion experimentation and a good starting point. In contrast, multivariate testing
requires deeper analysis and consists of a lot more variables than A/B testing. A/B split
testing is the practice of creating two or more versions of the same page and splitting the
traffic between these versions by randomly assigning visitors. A test usually consists of a
champion version (the original page) and a challenger version (the alternative page). The
version that generates the highest number of conversions will become the new champion
which in turn will be challenged by another round of tests (Ash et al. 2012, p. 332).
Multivariate testing, however, is inherently much more complex as it involves multiple
challenger versions. It allows for testing of multiple combinations of multiple versions of
a set number of page elements, while using the same type of random assignment amongst
visitors as A/B testing (Goward 2013, p. 288-290). To simplify, multivariate testing lets
marketers carry out many A/B tests concurrently, showing a different combination of
elements for each visitor and providing data on which combination of elements or which
specific elements generated the best result among visitors (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 45).
Table 3 illustrates how a multivariate test could work. It assumes that a page has two page
elements with two variables (e.g. two versions of a heading and two versions of a CTA).
This number of variables results in four possible versions of a page, 2 x 2 = 4. Assuming
the original variables are on the champion page the possible combination of all variables
would result in three challenger pages.

Theoretically, this method could be used for an infinite number of page elements, but
understandably it becomes increasingly complex as the elements increase. This type of
50

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

testing requires a software solution with automation processes for data gathering and
analysis (Rothman 2014, p. 323).
Both multivariate and A/B testing can be used for very granular testing of specific
elements on a page or complete page redesigns. Complete redesigns are not uncommon,
but they require more time and development to perform and a positive result cannot be
guaranteed so it is debatable whether the test is worth performing. Back-to-back testing
with incremental granularity changes are better for singling out specific elements, while
it also is fast and easy to implement, e.g. changing a heading. However, if a site has a low
amount of traffic these types of tests take a significant amount of time. Therefore, if a
page has many elements that should be tested under a time constraint, a complete redesign
can be the better option compared to fine-granularity tests (Ash et al. 2012, p. 256).
Both Ash et al. (2012, p. 331) and Goward (2013, p. 291) suggests favoring A/B testing
over multivariate. Multivariate testing has its benefits, but it is a far larger project to
undertake and can therefore generate a significant amount of costs. It is also very complex
for most marketers to perform. Due to the high number of possible page versions
multivariate testing can facilitate, a test requires a lot of time to gather a reliable amount
of traffic for every page version in order to be beneficial. According to Goward (2013, p.
291), multivariate testing can require as many as 60 000 – 100 000 unique monthly
visitors per page to generate reliable results.

4.3 Conversion design in practice
Conversion design can be a complex process. The different concepts, the terminology and
the various approaches can be confusing. When should marketers think from an LPO
standpoint and when from a CRO standpoint? Or when should usability go before a
supposedly highly converting psychological que, Or when should a page sacrifice a
beautiful design for something that allows for better functionality? Focusing on small
fixes is a good, and an easier start, and many scholars and consultants talk about
improvements that quickly or easily improve conversions. However, only focusing on
“low-hanging fruit” will not achieve the full potential of a website, i.e. it will not generate
as many leads as it could (Rabhan 2013, p. 1-2). Knowing which solutions and elements
of conversion design to apply when and where requires an educated understanding of the
concept itself. Conversion design could be summarized as modern-day web design that
51

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

focuses on driving measurable results beyond just marketing, and in actual sales. The
website is a tool for lead generation and for many businesses the most important tool in
the sales cycle. Naturally, the step forward would be to try and increase the number of
leads the website produces, but as has been mentioned many companies do not realize
this. They focus on presenting their products from an internal perspective and with a
visual focus, rather than focusing on developing a functionally useful customer-centric
website (Nielsen 2006; Gofman, Moskowitz & Metz 2009, p. 286; Blanks & Jesson 2018,
p. 35; Rabhan 2013, p. 111).
The following quote by Leake et al. describes conversion design well. In this case, the
authors are discussing the relationship between usability and CRO but the same is true
for all concepts within conversion design.
“While usability and CRO are not exactly the same thing, they are not in conflict,
and they are highly related. Marketers can combine these two practices to create
efficient copy and design based on principles of usability and then, with CRO,
tailor the landing page to the target audience and maximize its effectiveness. In
that tailoring, the design and messaging groups need to be flexible and test
approaches that do not always follow usability instincts.” (Leake et al. 2012, p.
142)

The actual process of conversion design adopts an experimental approach with an
iterative design process. Decisions are based on what the previous test or experiment
generated as a result. The work process is illustrated in figure 11. The goal (step 2) is
usually to increase leads but it can also be other factors, such as making visitors navigate
to a specific page or to effect what type of leads are generated. Step 3 is maybe the most
significant step in the process since it relates to identifying and designing the on-page
elements that will have an impact on the conversion rate. As results are measured the
process repeats itself.
An experimental approach is best suited for small and frequent incremental changes
because this harbors continuous improvement, which results in an upward trajectory of
conversions. More comprehensive redesigns of entire websites can feel like problemsolvers, but in the long-run a new design will encounter the same problems as the old one.
Therefore, it is better to continuously improve on what one already has to see positive
results (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 67). Small incremental changes are also a lot easier to
manage, implement and especially measure.
52

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 11: An experimental process of conversion design.

The theoretical concepts presented in this chapter are, as Leake et al. (2012, p. 142) puts
it “not in conflict”, rather they should work in unison, complementing each other.
Conversion design requires a business-driven mindset, it is a combination of web design
and marketing that is motivated by return-on-investment. This is what this chapter has
described so far. It has provided the fundamentals for understanding what designing for
conversion is and how it differs from other approaches to web design.
However, how to perform conversion design in practice is still unclear. To be able to
increase conversion rates marketers must understand which variables or on-page elements
that visitors’ value, thus having an effect on the conversion rate (Yang et al. 2004, p.
1150). This essentially describes step 3 in the work process in figure 11; identify variables
that can reach goal.
In his book Designing Web Usability, Jakob Nielsen (2000) divides web design into three
main areas; Site design and structure, page design, and content design. From a conversion
point of view these areas hold true, although they require some development. Site design
and structure refers to subjects that are relevant for the entire website, these are subjects
such as the design style, organization of content (information architecture) and
navigation. Page design refers to subjects thar are related to layout, title, content,
responsiveness and on-page navigation. Content design in turn is concerned with
copywriting and presentation of content including the use of bullet lists and hyperlinks.

53

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 291-336) also describe key areas that are relevant for web
design, namely function, form and content. Functions refers to interaction, navigation and
structure, while form refers to aesthetics created by visual design including graphics,
color, style, layout and typography. Content, in turn, refers to copywriting and relevancy
to target audience.
Most models found in the field of e-servicescapes that were discussed in section 4.2.4
describe quality determinants that are highly similar to the areas of web design that the
authors above discuss. The quality determinants are also very much related to the
fundamentals of persuasive design found in the concepts of user-centered design,
conversion rate optimization and landing page optimization as was presented in previous
sections. Although the concepts presented are considered as separate fields both in
academia and business, they are all relevant for businesses that aim to increase their
conversion rate through a corporate website. Therefore, common dimensions for
conversion design based upon all the various marketing fields and conceptual models
described in this chapter must be established so that an in-depth analysis of conversion
design on the case-company’s webpage can be carried out. As Santos (2003, p. 236)
explains “there is a need for web designers to understand consumers and for academic
researchers to evaluate the Internet and provide an appropriate framework”.
As described in section 4.2.4, most conceptual models for e-service quality share similar
quality determinants despite differences in focus and naming conventions. The same is
true for all models of web design as the models by Nielsen (2000) and Chaffey and Smith
(2013) exemplify. The design frameworks of UCD, CRO and LPO are also quite similar,
they simply adapt different approaches and are generally applied in various scenarios of
web design. LPO and CRO share the same ultimate goal of increasing long-term sales
while UCD focuses on improving the user experience, which is prerequisite of increasing
conversions and sales in LPO and CRO.
By borrowing from the conceptual models of e-service quality and the user experience
and sales driven mindsets of UCD, LPO and CRO, a hypothesized model for conversion
design can be created. Just as e-services define quality dimensions and determinants, the
presented model defines conversion dimensions and conversion determinants. Table 4
defines the relevant conversion dimensions that have been identified through the literature
reviewed in chapter 4, while chapter 5 will take a deeper look into these dimensions to

54

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

establish the relevant conversion determinants after which the complete model is
presented in section 5.5. The conversion dimensions in table 4 have been identified
through various sources cited throughout this chapter. However, four models; Nielsen
(2000), Harris and Goode (2010), Chaffey and Smith (2013) and Santos (2003) have been
used to illustrate the logical categorization of each dimension. The conversion dimensions
have been established as aesthetics, usability, content and credibility.

4.4 Chapter summary
Chapter 3 has discussed lead generation in B2B marketing with a specific focus on the
corporate website, and more precisely the design of the corporate website as a lead
generation site. The chapter has analyzed this theme through an academical lens by
defining the most prominent marketing concepts and theories that are relevant in the
development of lead generation websites. It has defined the concept and the role of
conversion design as a part of this development. So far, the theoretical concepts that guide
55

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

conversion design have been accounted for, but in order to understand how these concepts
are applied in practice, the specific elements that can and should be optimized on a
webpage must be identified. The following chapter will examine all the elements on a
webpage that can have a positive effect on conversions. The chapter is divided into four
main parts based on the quality dimensions presented in section 4.3, Aesthetics, Content,
Usability and Credibility.

5 DEVELOPING A CONVERSION-CENTERED WEBSITE
This chapter will analyze the main dimensions of conversion design through the various
design frameworks and marketing concepts that were defined in chapter 4. To provide a
proper understanding of what on-page elements marketers should focus on when
designing for conversions, the chapter will aim to thoroughly explain all dimensions and
their respective conversion determinants. Based on the findings throughout this and the
previous chapter, the hypothesized model for conversion design will be presented in
section 5.5. This model will be applied in the development of a new design for the casecompany and will also work as the basis for evaluation of the new and old design of the
subject page.

5.1 Aesthetics
Visual design, while creating pleasing user experiences and enhancing usability, has also
been proven to be a major quality determinant for most website visitors. In fact, Lindgaard
and Dudek (2002) found that visual appeal can be independent from usability, i.e. if the
visitors encounter major issues with usability, it will not affect their perception of the
visual design. Moreover, they found that a visually good-looking website can even draw
attention away from usability problems. However, this does not mean that usability
should or could be sacrificed for aesthetics, but it does highlight the influence visual
appeal has over website visitors. Lindgaard et al. (2006) also found that the visual appeal
is especially important during the very first moments a visitor experiences on a page. This
is because the visuals are detected first, before the visitor interacts or engages with the
site to judge other aspects such as usability and content. The visual appeal that the visitors
encounter during the first impression also influences how they judge the continued
56

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

experience on the website. If the first impression is positive, they may rate the following
content more favorably, which will inherently drive visitor engagement (Jennings 2002).
This effect of evaluation and enjoyment that visual appeal has, especially through the first
impression, is in psychology called the halo effect. This is due to cognitive conformation
bias, which refers to a trait in human psychology that drives people to search “for
confirmatory evidence supporting their initial hypothesis while ignoring disconfirmatory
evidence” (Lindgaard et al. 2006, p. 115). Consequently, visitors can disregard or
downplay negative factors that might occur later if the first impression is good enough.
However, conformation bias is not limited to positive first impressions, in fact negative
impressions have a great impact on user evaluation as well (Everard & Galletta 2003, p.
60-61). A negative first impression may lead to visitors ignoring potential positive factors,
not allowing their opinion to be changed as they continue to browse the website.
When creating visual appeal, marketers must also remember to follow certain guidelines,
such as that of visual hierarchy for example. Visitors interpret the importance of
perceptual elements on a page through their arrangement and size. Usually hierarchically
important elements such as the headings are expected to be at the top, simultaneously
large elements such as an image or a text block signifies greater importance. By aligning
elements properly, visitors can be guided through the page. This allows marketers to guide
visitors to important on-page elements such as call to actions, or to mark an important
element through visual hierarchy (Djamasbi et al. 2010, p. 308).
Depending on factors such as demographics, visitors also expect certain standards and
other familiar elements from websites. Djambasi et al. (2010) found in their study that
generation Y web users find visual appeal to be particularly important in the evaluation
of websites. These visitors seem to consider usability as a prerequisite, while aesthetics
is an expectation (Djambasi et al. 2010, p. 309). The study concluded that generation Y
finds characteristics such as images of people, search features and a small amount of text
to be very important for visual appeal.
Studies also show that website visitors rank the look of the design and the structure of
information as top determinants when judging the credibility of websites (Fogg, Soohoo,
Danielson, Marable, Stanford & Tauber 2003, p. 23). Visual appeal develops trust
between the visitor and the site, whereas a non-visually appealing site might lead the
visitor to question its credibility and the credibility of the business. The correlation
57

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

between beauty and trust can be so irrational that visitors make on the spot and intuitive
emotional decisions purely on the perception of appearance (Karvonen 2000, p. 87). Apart
from judging the website’s quality and credibility based on aesthetics, visual appeal has
also been recognized as a good predictor for visitors’ purchase intentions, which in B2B
lead generation context can be considered as intention to convert, and as a predictor of
the intention to revisit a website (Loiacono, Watson & Goodhue 2002).
5.1.1 Typography
Typography plays a great role in complementing the visual appeal of a webpage and its
contribution to the persuasive power of a website is often underestimated (Chaffey &
Smith 2013, p. 316). When it comes to typography and design there are not that many
rules but failing to adhere to common rules may result in a very unappealing website.
Generally, text must be clearly readable, visually appealing to the audience and refrain
from screaming colors and theatrical effects. A very futuristic typeface in a bright color
combined with a blinking effect will probably not appeal to a B2B buyer looking for a
multimillion-dollar software investment.
Typography is mainly used for portraying site personality, or visual brand identity.
Personality can be described as e.g. “formal” or “fun”. In a B2B context visitors tend to
lean to the formal and towards information-intensive websites. The choice of typefaces
must also be consistent and sans-serif fonts are considered to work best on the web
(Chaffey & Elis-Chadwick 2012 p. 316). However, specific types of fonts can create
different emotional responses in visitors such as the formal or fun mentioned above, but
also anger, excitement or confusion. Just as size and layout effects the visual hierarchy of
a webpage, so does typography. Solid typographical structures provide substance for
visitors, thus helping in identifying headings, separating links from copy and finding
important information that might e.g. be presented in a bulleted list. A page should be
easily scannable, and towards that end typographical structures have a significant role to
play (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 124).
According to Chaffey and Elis-Chadwick (2012 p. 317) font sizes are also important for
structure and design, the difference in size between different parts of a text can suggest
level of importance, but also suggest coherency to neighboring elements. It has been
suggested that e.g. elderly website visitors require larger text for increased readability.
58

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

However, one study that tested web usability differences among young and senior web
users found that the increase of text size did not affect the performance of any age group
(Chadwick-Dias, McNaulty & Tullis 2003). Following font-size standards is generally
recommended. Italics and underlining can have a negative effect on readability and create
confusion. Underlining, for example, usually indicates a hyperlink, i.e. a clickable
element. As with most aspects of design, typography requires consistency. It is mainly
driven by readability and visual hierarchy and the maintenance of consistency regarding
these aspects throughout the website. All practical elements regarding typographical
styling should be predetermined and controlled for consistency.
5.1.2 Color and contrast
The impact of color has been studied in virtually every field of marketing, and web design
is no different. In virtual environments, the use of color can take even larger proportions
than in many offline settings. This is due to the fact that marketers are confined to a virtual
environment where only visual elements can be used to communicate with the visitors
and affect their senses. Color is especially important for highlighting specific page
elements, such as elements marketers want to draw visitor attention towards, and for
enhancing readability (Goward 2013, p. 191). According to Chaffey and Elis-Chadwick
(2012 p. 317), color on websites should satisfy three sets of criteria; be the right fit for
the target segment, fit with the corporate brand and be right for both usability and
accessibility. While satisfying all three of these areas, the color pallet must also balance
them equally and therefore consist of a set of colors that simultaneously satisfies all three
areas while also working well together.
Many studies have been made in the pursuit of deciphering the meaning of colors for
website visitors and it has been proven to have a prominent role in website aesthetics
(Brian & Phillips 2003). Coursaris, Swierenga and Watrall (2008) studied color
temperatures in web design and found that the majority of visitors prefer cool colors over
warm ones. The most visually appealing color scheme was found to be a cool color for
the top part and primary elements of a page, and either another cool color or a warm one
for the secondary elements. Colors have also been known to be associated with different
emotional responses. For example, in western cultures red is associated with anger,
danger and love, while blue is associated with calmness, reliability and professionalism.

59

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

However, associations with color is highly dependent on cultural norms and can be
perceived differently by different people (Chaffey & Elis-Chadwick 2012, p. 315).
Perceived color associations are also not as important as the clarity of the color combined
with contrast, and the design of the actual elements (Goward 2013, p. 193).
In conversion design, it is not always so much about actual colors as it is about contrasts.
Some suggest that specific colors, such as red, are good for CTA buttons because it
commands attention (Goward 2013, p. 193), in fact, it is the contrast of the button that
draws visitor attention, not the actual color of the button. For example, a predominantly
blue website design will not benefit from a CTA button with another shade of blue, while
a green or red button may generate an increase in conversions because then the button
would stand out. Despite the significance of contrast, color cannot be deemed irrelevant
for conversion purposes, but elements that should stand out are more dependent on the
use of contrast between colors than the actual choice of color (Gardner 2018, p. 15).
The easiest way to have the greatest possibility of freedom regarding contrast on a website
is to utilize neutral background colors. Light background colors are generally the easiest
on the eyes, because a dark typeface on a light background is easier to read than the other
way around. The most important thing is to make sure there is a high level of contrast
between background and text, regardless of the background color (Frick & Eyler-Werve
2015, p. 85). The neutral background color is not only healthy for visitors’ eyes, it also
facilitates a design that is easy to understand, as the visitors clearly comprehend the text
and elements on the page as they stand out from the background. A neutral color is also
preferred in comparison with graphics or images in the background, since these can make
it difficult to distinguish key elements from the background itself (Everard & Galletta
2006, p. 66; Ash 2008, p. 132).
As with all aesthetically focused design elements of a webpage, also color needs to
comply with scannability. Reduced contrast between background and other elements
affects the site’s readability and can cause frustration for visitors (Frick & Eyler-Werve
2015, p. 85; Everard & Galletta 2006). Furthermore, Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 315)
highlight that the use of white space is essential for a usable and visually appealing design.
White space is basically the empty space between elements on a webpage, it is usually
represented by the background color of the page. White space is important for both
readability and usability, because it gives an “airy” feel and allows the user to clearly

60

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

distinguish one element from another. Websites that do not properly utilize white space
tend to be perceived as crowded and can have a negative effect on the user experience.
A final aspect of color that is useful to consider is the brightness of the colors used on the
website. Brightness of text for example can look different on different screens depending
on external factors beyond of the marketer’s control (Goward 2013, p. 192). Visitors can
manipulate the settings of their devices, use blue-light filters or similar and even the light
in the physical environment that the visitor is in can affect how visible certain elements
on a webpage are. Contrast plays a key part here as well, considering that e.g. a bright
color on a neutral background might not have enough contrast on all screens to be
displayed properly.
5.1.3 Imagery
Most websites incorporate some sort of imagery in their design. Websites with images
have been found to have a positive correlation with visual appeal (Cober, Brown & Levy
2004). Djambasi et al. (2010) found in their research that images, especially large images
that dominate a page correlate well with most visitors. It has also been suggested that
since the virtual environment lacks human contact, this can be substituted with images of
people. Images of people spark a psychological connection with the visitors that generates
the artificial feeling of human contact and warmth (Hassanein & Head 2007). Including
faces and real human beings can also help in personalizing a brand.
In terms of conversion design however, Ash (2008, p. 138) points out that images are a
powerful two-edged sword. Images can either complement the value proposition and key
elements on the website and support desired visitor actions, or they can work as a
distraction that takes focus away from where the visitor is supposed to go. However, when
used well, images can have a powerful impact on conversions. Visitors cannot help but
to look at images with humans in them and their vision is usually drawn to faces (Ash
2008, p. 138). This is a psychological trait that has been examined through eye tracking
studies (Gardner 2018, p. 21). Images can, therefore, be utilized to guarantee increased
exposure for call to actions and other prominent elements on a page.
Images can additionally be used as directional ques to guide attention to a specific
element. If a page e.g. includes an image with a person looking in a specific direction, the
image can be placed so that the model’s vision is directed towards a point of interest on
61

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the page. Visitors will instinctively look at the models face and subsequently in the same
direction as the model is looking. Gardner (2018, p. 19) calls this the “suggestive power
of the eye” and can also be realized through images of animals. Directional ques are not
limited to real-life images of people, symbols and icons such as arrows can be used for
this purpose as well. Images that portray some sort of pathway, such as a road or tunnel
can also guide attention if used cleverly. Goward (2013, p. 182) states that “the placement
of images, graphics and copy either guide your reader’s eye or block its flow”. Despite
the suggestive power of images as directional ques and their influence on visual appeal,
it is crucial that a webpage advocates clarity and has a suitable balance between all of the
elements on the page, including CTAs, text, images, icons and links.

5.2 Content
With the importance of search engines and the rise of content marketing, content is one
of the most important elements in all of digital marketing, and therefore equally important
in conversion design. Meerman Scott (2015, p. 128) states that “Content is not only king,
but president and pope as well”. If a website delivers aesthetic appeal and creates a
positive first impression while adhering to important usability factors (discussed in detail
in the following section), the content is what will convince visitors to convert. This is
especially true in B2B where buyers generally require more information than in B2C.
Visual ques and persuasion design in itself can obviously not generate leads, at least not
leads of good quality. According to Rabhan (2013, p .109), conversion rate optimization
is divided roughly into two halves, of which the first is design, layout and other usability
related elements, and the other is tweaking messages and words on the page. Redish
(2012, p. 1) also neatly describes the importance of content through a metaphor by
comparing a website to a simple three-legged stool. The legs represent the critical parts
of navigation, usable design and technology, but on their own the legs can’t stand upright,
they need a seat to be useful and usable. That’s where content comes in.
The content on a webpage needs to deliver what the visitors are looking for and it needs
to do this quickly (Ryan 2014, p. 30). Web content must be tailored to the audience it is
intended for, but it also needs to grab attention, be scannable and written in a clear way.
Visitors do not have the patience to read longer texts or dig for a value proposition
themselves, if they do not see the value immediately, they will leave (Ryan 2014, p. 61).
62

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Therefore, it is important to deliver the most essential points first, at the top of the page
in the so-called above the fold area which is the first screenful a visitor sees (explained in
more detail in section 5.3.2). The first screenful is also responsible for the first impression
mentioned earlier.
Deciding what to put at the top of a page is easier said than done. Marketing professionals
suggest designing the above the fold area as a mini landing page (Gardner 2018). The
mini landing page is built upon the five-point punch; (1) a heading with (2) subheading,
(3) a benefit statement with benefit list, (4) an urgency or special offer statement and (5)
a CTA. The mini landing page method is illustrated in figure 12.
Figure 12: The mini landing page (Gardner 2018).

Blanks and Jesson (2018, p. 62-65) advocates a, what they call, functional approach to
web design when focusing on conversions. They suggest that understanding the visitors
and the business, and then designing accordingly is most important. Usually that means
a healthy balance between content and aesthetics, but webpages can lean more heavily
towards either one, depending on the target segments needs and the business goals.
However, Blanks and Jesson (2018, p. 65), do state that designing for function, i.e.
designing for the needs stated above in the most functional and intuitive way possible, is
more important than beauty. Visual appeal cannot take the forefront in design. Beauty
should not be allowed to limit the functionality of a webpage because functionality plays
63

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

a greater role in driving conversions. Mostly beauty does not aid in creating quality leads,
however, it has been proven to be a significant experience affecting factor as described in
section 5.1.
Within web design in general content refers mainly to the written copy of a page, as still
today written text and the links between these texts is the core of the web (Ryan 2014, p.
50). Copy defines all the text present on a page, including headings, product descriptions,
value propositions etc. (Rabhan 2013, p. 109). When trying to align visitor needs and
business goals, copy must be written for the visitor and be persuasive at the same time.
5.2.1 Copywriting
The subject of copywriting is rather large and includes a lot of intricacies. For the purpose
of conversion design, copywriting mainly concerns the placement of content, providing
the relevant information for the target segment and using persuasive copy to increase
conversions. Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 326) suggest the CRABS method when creating
copy for the web. CRABS stands for; chunking, relevance, accuracy, brevity and
scannability. Chunking, brevity and scannability relate to the visual presentation of the
text, which is largely dependent on the fact that visitors indeed scan pages and do not
actually read word for word. Relevance and accuracy in turn, represent the customercentric approach of copywriting, i.e. the copy should be relevant for the visitors’ needs
and be available at the right time in the right place in a manner of context that is supported
by both visual and written elements. Similarly to CRABS, Rabhan (2013, p. 109) state
that copy should satisfy three psychological checkpoints for visitors; relevance,
credibility and value.
As was mentioned in section 5.1.1, scannability is a major element from a design and
readability standpoint. How text is styled, organized and divided helps visitors in
identifying the key messages on the page, this is also one of the most important elements
to in conversion design, as improving scannability involves e.g. avoiding large blocks of
text by the use of headings, subheadings and bullet points (Ryan 2014, p. 61). Various
visual elements can also be used to further separate copy and provide context, but the
copy should also manage to do this by itself. Bullet lists for example are an efficient way
of designing for scannability as these are easy to read and they draw attention. Bullet lists
are therefore a good way of maximizing the chance of visitors reading important copy.
64

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Good conversion copy should aim to list benefits and not just features. Specifically, how
the visitor benefits. For example, “24/7 support” is a feature while “get help anytime” is
a benefit. Both statements emphasize the same thing; that the business offers live support
for their customers, but “get help anytime” clearly tells the visitor what benefit they will
receive from that support (Rabhan 2013, p. 117).
The study by Djambasi et al. (2010) also suggested that visitors do not like to read long
texts on the web, further emphasizing that texts should be kept short and divided into
contextual paragraphs. Tullis and Tullis (2007, in Djambasi et al 2010, p. 312) confirmed
this as they also found a correlation between the number of characters on a page and the
visual appeal of that page. Conclusively, visitors combine visual appeal with a small
amount of text.
What is said where is crucial in conversion design. As mentioned in the previous section,
the most important content should be situated at the top of a page. Ryan (2014, p. 61) and
Leake et al. (2012, p. 156) suggests adapting the inverted pyramid technique to webpage
copy. According to the pyramid the most important points should be delivered first, and
supportive content delivered in a decreasing order of importance down the page, just as
many sources has suggested so far. Besides the CTA and benefit lists or statements, the
heading is the most prominent part of the top of a page. It is what draws attention right
away and what visitors look for to gain an indication of what the page is about. Headings
are difficult to perfect because they must satisfy a number of factors, they should e.g. be
keyword optimized for SEO, be descriptive of the content on the page, describe how
visitors may benefit, have a customer-centric tone, entice and engage the visitor etc., the
list goes on. Obviously, a handful of words cannot satisfy all criteria, it is also a matter of
context and placement. Every individual element on the page must not by itself increase
conversion, the objective is rather to find a balance between important elements and
tailoring for visitors’ needs. However, as far as attention goes the heading is an element
that needs to be thought about carefully. Redish (2012, p. 158) outlines seven guidelines
for writing persuasive headings on the web:
1. Use your site visitors’ words.
2. Be clear instead of cute.
3. Think about your global audience.
4. Try for a medium length (about eight words).
65

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

5. Use a statement, question, or call to action.
6. Combine labels (nouns) with more information.
7. Add a short description if people need it.
Source: Redish (2012, p. 158).
The tone used by businesses in their web copy tends to be very we based. Companies
focus more on telling visitors that they are the best in their specific field, rather than
focusing on the value that visitors will receive (Rabhan 2013, p. 112). Delivering the
value proposition is crucial, but there is a difference in saying “we sell the best TVs” and
“improve your entertainment experience with the best TVs ”. The main notion is to create
copy from the visitor perspective, telling them what they will get, rather than presenting
what it is the company behind the website does. The difference might be subtle, but the
visitor is interested in how the provided service or product will benefit him or her, by
making the visitors translate a company-centric copy to why it is valuable for them is a
very unnecessary step that can hinder conversions and is easily avoidable by focusing on
customer-centric copy in the writing process. This is also in line with something that Ash
(2008, p. 134) calls marketese. Marketese is a copywriting style that embellishes a
product or service by making it appear more attractive and usually involves boasting and
unsubstantiated claims such as “world’s leading provider” or similar. Visitors do not
resonate with this type of language as they have learned to tune out promotional copy
over time, a conversational tone that focuses on the visitor is therefore better.
However, how to write where is contextual. When trying to persuade visitors of value,
customer-centric copy is relevant, and it is important to talk to the visitors, but companycentric copy also has its place. For example, using “we”, “I” and “us” aids in developing
a conversational tone. Every interaction between a visitor and a website is a conversation
begun by the visitor and should be treated as such (Redish 2012, p. 2).
Specific wording has also been proven to have a huge impact on conversion rates. Just by
changing the wording of a heading for example has been shown to have both negative
and positive effects on completed conversions (Rabhan 2013, 110: Goward 2013, p. 195).
Changing specific words that have an impact is usually related to high value elements
such as headings or the call to action. Some of the easiest increases in conversion come
from changing the copy on a page, because ultimately design goes only so far, while copy
persuades visitors (Rabhan 2013, p. 110).
66

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

5.2.2 Call to action
“In order for a website visitor to become a lead, you have to tell him where to go and
what you want him to do” (Rothman 2014 p. 102). Guiding visitors is achieved through
many elements; navigation, layout and visual ques among others, but in conversion design
one of the most vital elements is the call to action (CTA).
As the single purpose of a conversion-centered page should be to persuade visitors to
perform an action, the CTA is the most important design element in fulfilling that
purpose. The call to action is usually a link to a lead generation form. Styling CTAs as a
button is commonplace but they can also be regular text-based hyperlinks (Goward 2013,
p. 194). The CTA should portray the offer that a webpage makes to the visitors, and
therefore it needs to stand out. This means it must be visually prominent and should be at
the top of a page, major CTAs should always be in the first screenful (Fessenden 2018).
CTAs should also be included on all pages of a site (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 136) and
should be consistent, at least on a page-level (Ash 2008, p. 149).
Visually prominent buttons are commonplace because they easily draw attention when
used correctly, i.e. when used in combination with color, contrast, placement and context.
Capsulation is also a common technique for CTAs and forms, it creates an immediate
sense of importance as visitors understand the visual que that a bordered area must be of
significance (Gardner 2019, p. 63). Creating visually prominent CTAs can be achieved
through other visual design elements as well, whitespace and sizes of elements and fonts
for example are relevant methods, and the use of imagery and icons with directional ques
as mentioned in section 5.1.3 have been proven to increase conversions. Leake et al.
(2012, p. 143) also point out that the CTA must follow expected conventions as visitors
are used to certain elements being in a certain way, such as the navigation at the top for
example. Extravagant designs for CTAs that do not utilize buttons or are presented as
simple links might therefore have negative implications. However, animated effects, such
as hover effects can help buttons stand out and indicates to the visitors that it is a clickable
object (Ash 2008, p. 154).
Even though conversion design should rely on incremental testing and metrics, the visual
prominence of CTAs and other high value elements such as headings can also be tested
through the eye-blur technique (Rabhan 2013, p. 96-97; Leake et al. 2012, p. 143). When
squinting so that a person’s vision gets blurred, only colors, high-contrast or brighter
67

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

elements will be visible. This test gives a good indication of what will draw the most
attention on a page, these elements are also what visitors’ subconsciousness will process
first and thus decides what they will consciously engage with first. The eye-blur technique
can be used in the design stage to assess if high value elements are as prominent as
planned.
In an eye tracking study of a corporate website that had the goal of increasing submitted
lead generation forms, having multiple links to the form on the same webpage resulted in
a higher rate of conversions. The links alone did not necessarily cause the increase but
when placed within relevant context as part of an intuitive design more visitors found
their way to the form and also eventually converted (Boaz, Cueno, Kreps & Watson 2002,
p. 162). The emphasis of context suggests that the content, CTA and design must all
achieve a state of flow for the visitor, i.e. the content needs an intuitive path and it must
feel as a natural step to e.g. press a CTA button. Many CTAs to the same goal are therefore
beneficial, but not if they do not provide contextual value. Having many CTAs on the
same page is also a matter of attention ratio which is described in detail in section 5.3.2,
but in short attention ratio describes the number of distracting actions a visitor can
perform on a page that is not directly related to the business goal.
As mentioned previously, the wording in the call to action might have a significant impact
on conversions. Which words work best however, is a trial and error process but there are
some generic guidelines for what might have a positive impact on the conversion rate.
Action-oriented verbs such as buy, share or request clearly state that it is an action. The
result of said action can also be included, and the benefit the visitor will receive by
performing that action is important. For example, “get your free trial now”, is action
oriented while translating both the result and the benefit at the same time (Frick & EylerWerve 2015, p. 120). In other words, being too vague and unfocused is a mistake (Leake
et al. 2012, p. 143).
Focusing the CTA is also dependent on the visitor’s intent. If the main action on the site
is to convert into a lead, that from a buyer’s perspective means submitting an inquiry for
additional information regarding a specific product, then a CTA such as “Request your
consultation” is significantly more focused and action-oriented than something such as
“how can we help you” (Leake et al. 2012, p. 143). Which exact words that make up the
CTA is also affected by the tone of voice, ideally customer-centric, and other individual

68

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

words that have a positive correlation with CTA clicks. Among these words you, free and
get are good examples that have been proven to perform well (Redish 2012, p. 198;
Rabhan 2013, p. 118). Very generic CTAs with text such as “click here” or “read more”
should be avoided because they provide none of the value-adding elements mentioned
above (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 121). Halligan and Shah (2014, p. 137) also mention
the phrase “contact us” as being one of the least converting call to actions.
The message a CTA provides should be compelling. Visitors are skeptical in giving out
personal information so if the content is making them consider converting, the CTA must
persuade them. Offering additional content with a promise of added value through
benefits is a good practice for convincing visitors. This content can be webinars,
whitepapers, consultations or demos, anything that the visitors will deem beneficial and
thus allows them to convert into a lead (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 135). If a B2B company
usually propose demos to potential buyers for example, then offering this value already
in the CTA is good practice.
The most educating theory regarding CTAs, and also web usability in general, is
epitomized in the book Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug (2014). When visitors arrive
on a website, they should not have to think about what to do. They want to be guided,
told where to go, what to do and what they will get, and CTAs especially must match this
premise.
5.2.3 Visitor needs
When creating content for visitor’s needs it is important to recognize that visitors do not
always share the same needs. Even if they are in the same target segment, their needs can
vary drastically according to each individual’s situation. On a broader scale a website is
segmented into different content themes by having different pages, and each individual
page should be aligned to a business and a visitor goal (Leake et al. 2012, p. 146).
However, on the page-level visitors can share a goal but differ in the way they will reach
that goal because they are in different stages of the buying process. Some might be
persuaded to convert at the top of the page, while others need more information and scroll
down, in which case they first need to be convinced that the content below is of value by
the above the fold content (Goward 2013, p. 162). On top of that, B2B buyers on the web
rarely move linearly between the stages of the buying process. They jump in and out while
69

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

researching solutions and evaluating options. One visitor might arrive at a bottom-offunnel product page, then move on to a top-of-funnel blog article before deciding to
convert on the homepage several days or months later (van den Akker 2019).
The AIDA model which was discussed in section 4.2.3 is, albeit old, a good framework
for defining how to structure the contextual hierarchy of content on a webpage (Gardner
2018). The AIDA defines the stages a web visitor goes through before converting;
awareness, interest, desire and action (Ash 2008, p. 68). Tailoring the page towards these
stages automatically creates a hierarchy. First the page must create awareness that the
visitor’s attention is drawn to and which provides incentive to keep reading, after which
the content should match the interest and desire stages as the visitor scrolls down by
providing further information and finally, provoke the visitor to take action with a call to
action.
This adaption of the AIDA model relies on the visitor converting at the bottom of the
page. On the contrary, marketers and authors alike suggest that a CTA should always be
present at the top of the page (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 136). Rabhan (2013, p. 102)
states that many visitors will never scroll down far enough to see the CTA if it is only at
the bottom. However, this is dependent on what works best with specific visitors and
should be tested. Different models can work differently between pages and a website does
not need to follow a set model throughout all of its pages, e.g. a combination of the AIDA
and other models such as the mini landing page model for the first screenful could be a
good match on one page, while only the AIDA works better on another. Goward (2013,
p. 194) suggests having one CTA at the top and one at the bottom, but also encourages to
test what works best. All this being said, most sources seem to agree that a CTA visible
above the fold is best practice.
The AIDA is based on a linear progression from the first stage that is at the top of a
webpage, to the last which is at the bottom. This is a logical content hierarchy as research
minded visitors who scroll down probably want to know more details and is also aligned
with the inverted pyramid technique. However, the AIDA does not directly define
different types of visitors. All visitors might go through the stages, but they might still
have different needs. Which means that the stages must be tailored to various needs and
not just one, otherwise some visitors will not move through the stages but jump off as
they consider the information provided to be lacking. Therefore, the various stages should

70

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

be tailored according to the identified visitor profiles, e.g. some buyers might be more
technical than others, meaning that the value proposition in the interest stage for example
should speak to both technically savvy and non-technical visitors (Näse 2019).
Rabhan (2013, p. 102-103) further suggests designing each screenful or “foldpage” as a
separate page to target various visitor needs. Visitors who scroll are likely to be researchminded and want to explore every detail of the product. Therefore, more detailed content
and educative material works better further down the page. Some visitors act on impulse
and convert right away, meaning that a CTA such as a button or even short form should
be above the fold to satisfy these visitors. Considering each screenful as a segment of its
own can also help in the optimization process as marketers can consider how to make
each separate foldpage convert better. For example, every foldpage can have its own call
to action tailored to a specific visitor profile or customer segment. Rabhan (2013, p. 149)
also suggests applying an exit strategy for every foldpage in the form of CTAs or subtle
links to more detailed product pages. The point being that if visitors are going to navigate
away from the current page, they end up somewhere that brings them closer to a
conversion.

5.3 Usability
Usability is one of the key concepts of web design that has a direct correlation with user
experience and satisfaction, websites must be designed with usability as a guiding
framework (Nielsen 2000). As conversion design aims to apply a customer-centric
approach to web design that still has a stronger focus on business goals than user-centered
design, usability is one of the main pillars for maintaining a good user experience and
improving conversions. Poor usability leads to a negative user experience and might lead
to the visitors questioning the credibility of the website (Harris & Goode 2010: Everard
& Galletta 2003).
“The theory behind web usability is straightforward enough: simple, elegant and
functional design helps users to achieve what they want to achieve online more
effectively. It’s about taking the frustration out of the user experience, making
sure things work intuitively, eliminating barriers so that users accomplish their
goals almost effortlessly. Your goal is to help the user to do what they want to do
in the most efficient and effective way possible. Everything else is just web
clutter.” (Ryan 2014, p. 47).
71

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Nielsen (2012) defines usability as how easy and pleasant the features that a visitor needs
are to use, i.e. usability is a top determinant for whether visitors to a corporate website
enjoy their experience or not. The virtual environment that constitutes a website also
increases the importance of usability in comparison to non-virtual service environments.
As Nielsen (2019) confirms, the difference between the physical and virtual world has
consequences of great proportion for usability. In the psychical world buyers are unlikely
to exit a store just because they are not entirely satisfied with the experience, they will
rather complete their goal despite a negative service encounter. On the web however,
visitors always have the option of exiting a site whenever they want to (see section 4.1.3,
figure 8) and the existing competitors are just a click or two away. Exiting an unpleasing
website takes less than a second and more often than not the visitor navigates back to a
search engine result page and chooses the next competitor of the list, whilst in the physical
world the effort to go to a competitor from the original service provider is far more
laborious.
In the model developed by Harris and Goode (2010) based upon visitor trust in websites,
usability and visual appeal where the top two determinants for developing trust. Also,
Chaffey and Smith 2013, p. 311-328) state that aesthetics and ease of use are the key
factors for making visitors return to a website. This shows that usability is not only
important for user satisfaction, but that usability is an evaluation criterion in deciding
whether or not a visitor will engage further with the company behind the website, meaning
that the implications usability has on conversions is undeniable.
5.3.1 Navigation
One major factor for achieving optimal usability and ease of use is navigation (Chaffey
2015, p. 560). Chaffey and Elis-Chadwick (2012) define navigation as “how easy it is to
find and move between different information on a website. It is governed by menu
arrangements, site structure and the layout of individual pages”. Since navigation
represents how visitors move around a site or page, it can be broken down into both sitewide navigation and on-page navigation. Therefore, it encompasses elements such as
menu items, links, flow and layout (layout will be analyzed in more detail in the next
section). Navigation builds on website structure, or information architecture, which is the
technical term. Information architecture represents how content (i.e. pages, documents

72

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

and files) are grouped on the website and how they relate to one another. The architecture
requires techniques such as card sorting or blueprints to be established. A thought-out
architecture with understandable hierarchies allows visitors to form a mental map of the
site, making sure they do not become lost (Chaffey & Smith 2012, p. 328).
Chaffey (2015, p. 560-561) defines two different approaches to architectural hierarchy on
websites. These are the narrow and deep approach and the broad and shallow approach,
see figure 13. Narrow and deep means that there are few links per page, but the hierarchy
goes deep, meaning that most pages have a link to a subpage. An architecture such as this
facilitates clean pages that do not become cluttered with links, because every page only
needs one or two links to the next level down in the hierarchy. The broad and shallow, in
contrast, has more links per page and thus a shallower hierarchy. The benefit of this
approach is that visitors are required to make fewer clicks to reach a specific piece of
content, which can be beneficial since some suggest that visitors should be able to find
the content they are looking for in a maximum number of three clicks (Chaffey & Smith
2012, p. 329).
Figure 13: The narrow and deep approach compared to the broad and shallow (Chaffey
2015, p. 561). Revised.

Exceptional navigation can aid in achieving a so-called state of flow for visitors. Flow is
defined as seamless interactivity between human and machine characterized by an
intrinsically enjoyable experience. It also generates a loss of self-consciousness and self73

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

monitoring (Novak, Hoffman & Young 2000, in Seonjeong & Miyoung 2012, p. 47).
Flow has been identified to increase purchase and revisit intentions among website
visitors (Agarwal & Karahanna 2000; Luna, Peracchio & de Juan 2002), meaning that
generating a state of flow through navigation and web design will have a positive impact
on conversion rates. In fact, navigation has been found to be imperative for achieving
flow (Rettie 2001). Chaffey and Smith (2012, p. 329) also describe flow as the “degree
or power a consumer has over the site”. A satisfiable degree of control results in an
enjoyable experience. Allowing the visitors to feel in control is dependent on navigational
elements such as buttons and links to help them easily find the information they want.
More often than not, a navigational element is also a point of interactivity, i.e. an element
that allows the visitor to perform any type of action. As such, interactivity is also
important for a state of flow. Interactivity will be discussed in detail in section 5.3.3.
Creating a good navigational experience can be difficult when you want to satisfy user
intents, buyers in different stages of the funnel, visitor goals and business goals. Some
elements are also expected of the audience, such as placing the main navigation menu at
the top of a page, including tabs for “home” and “about”, and the company logo in the
upper right or left corner (Rabhan 2013, p. 147; Leake et al. 2012, p. 157). Navigation is
highly dependent on visual ques and labels such as the ones described above, also called
signposts.
Nielsen (2000, in Chaffey & Smith 2012, p. 330) states that highlighting where on the
page the visitor is located is important so that the visitor does not feel lost among the
content. This can be achieved through highlighting items in the main navigation menu or
implementing a breadcrumb-navigation trail that shows through which pages the visitor
has navigated to arrive at the current page. However, this is not purely restricted to
navigational elements such as menus. The website should constantly communicate what
is going on to the visitor. Headings of pages, for example, should resemble the wording
in the menu to create context, and the use of progress bars, loading indicators and thank
you pages is highly recommended (Esparza 2015). In conversion design, these elements
are especially important in the lead generation form to create a state of flow and avoid
confusion.
Visitors also expect the same menu for every page of the website (Rosen & Purinton
2004), which is in contradiction with some LPO principles that suggest removing the

74

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

navigation all together to direct the visitor’s attention exclusively towards converting.
However, this approach is recommended for pages that serve as a tailored landing page
for advertisements, meaning that the visitors do not navigate from the main website to a
page that is missing a navigation menu. Usually these pages are on a different site all
together (Ash 2008, p. 100), but they still run the risk of generating a confusing user
experience if the overall design is similar to the main website. For example, a visitor
might have seen the navigation menu on the main site only to return at a later time to a
landing page that does not have the menu which they expect to be there (since the visual
design is otherwise the same). Moreover, research indicates that the main navigation
should have no more than seven items. Simplicity in navigation, as in all usability design,
is paramount (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 330). In short, navigation should make sure that
everything on a website is easily accessible and that the visitors enjoy the experience of
finding the information that they need (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 328).
5.3.2 Layout & Simplicity
The layout of a webpage has a direct effect on visitor retention. Not only is the layout a
usability and accessibility factor, but it is also related to the first impression the visitor
gets from the website which is one of the most crucial elements, both for conversions and
retention. By first impression, marketers mean the very first things the visitor sees when
they arrive at the site. This does not only involve the visual impression per se, but factors
such as site speed for example also has an affect (Rosen & Purinton 2004, p. 793). The
first impression might be very negative if the webpage loads very slowly. Based on the
first impression, visitors decide within milliseconds whether they will stay, or leave the
site to look for an alternative. The first impression emphasizes the importance of the very
top of a webpage. In conversion design, this is called above the fold and represents the
first screenful of a page as has been described.
The visual layout above the fold is a primary component that effects the first impression.
The information processing that goes on in the visitor’s mind is entirely based on visual
ques such as shapes and colors at first, after which the visitor will scan the page and
finally rest their attention on the first area of focus (Goward 2013, p. 232). The aesthetic
appeal is therefore crucial as a first quality determinant and retention building factor. The

75

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

above the fold layout and content is exclusively responsible for the first impression and
therefore decisive for conversions and page engagement.
Some pages are structured so that important content or design elements are further down
the page, but this does not make the above the fold content any less important. Example:
a page has many segments of content in a hierarchical order and the aim is to make visitors
scroll and convert them at the bottom of the page according to the AIDA model. The
bottom of the page is therefore very important from a conversion standpoint, but the first
impression will still determine whether the visitors will make it to the bottom in the first
place (Goward 2013, p. 233).
The term above the fold derives from the newspaper industry in which it early on was
identified that the best place to position important adverts or notices was above the folded
part of the cover page, as this is the area that most people are likely to see. There has been
an emerging trend in web design of creating longer pages, surely related to the mobile
first phenomena, which suggests the above the fold content has lost its importance.
However, extensive eye tracking, heat map and scrolling research still suggests that what
the visitors first see is very important in most cases (Rabhan 2013, p 224). This does not
mean that all the content must be placed at the top, rather that the various sections of the
page should be tailored to different needs as suggested in section 5.2.3, and the above the
fold content is very much a part of that. Content prioritization is needed to define the most
important content that needs to be at the top of the webpage (Fessenden 2018) and the
mini landing page model explained in section 5.2 is a good tool for defining the above
the fold content.
In a study by Santos (2003, p. 240), it was also found that visitors prefer websites that can
fit into one screen. This indicates that visitors do not prefer long webpages which support
the statement above, that the area above the fold is important. The above the fold area is
exactly that which fits into the very first view of the visitor’s screen, meaning that its
effected by the screen resolution of the visitor’s device.
In addition to the first impression, user research has also suggested that most website
visitors do not engage in scrolling, i.e. they do not scroll further down the page. This can
be concluded from Santos findings regarding the “one screen fit”, and is also confirmed
by Goward (2013, p. 79). Other studies also display the same results. A very recent eye
tracking study by the Nielsen Norman Group on desktop monitors, showed that visitors
76

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

do scroll more than they used to, but that they still spend the most time at the top of a
webpage. The study showed that visitors spend 57 % of their time above the fold and 74
% in the first two screenfuls. Compared to a similar study the group made in 2010, the
above the fold viewing time was significantly lower in 2018, 80 % in 2010 versus 57 %
in 2018 (Fessenden 2018). However, both studies show the same pattern of decreased
visitor attention after the first fold. The results of the 2018 study are illustrated in figure
14.
The improved tendency to scroll is most likely a result mobile first, as well as responsive
and minimalist design principles. Despite this, it is clear that visitors still prefer content
at the top and do not engage in too much scrolling. The study even found that when only
analyzing the above the fold screenful, visitors designated more attention to the
information at the top of the screenful than to that at the bottom. Failing in providing a
good first impression or not giving visitors visual signifiers that there is more content
below can have an increasingly negative effect on scrolling (Fessenden 2018).
Figure 14: Percentage of viewing time in the eye tracking study by the Nielsen Norman
Group (Fessenden 2018). Revised.

Visitor behavior indicates that content needs to be prioritized from the top down in the
layout of a webpage. Another important element regarding the layout is that of simplicity.
Rosen and Purinton (2004) found simplicity to be one of the most important elements of
consideration when designing websites. Due to short attention spans, visitors do not like
sites that are confusing and messy. Sites need to be clean and easy to navigate, especially
for first time visitors. Simple designs were also found to be more visually appealing to
77

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

visitors. Simplicity also has a positive effect on the first impression since it generates a
straightforward and understandable design, additionally it also facilitates faster loading
times. Simplicity in content is also very important and too much content, especially above
the fold will overwhelm visitors (Goward 2013, p. 235).
With regard to simplicity, conversion design outlines something called attention ratio.
Attention ratio is the ratio between all the actions that can be taken on a webpage and the
one single business driven action conversion design wants visitors to perform. In practice
all the actions that can be taken are all the clickable links (or other elements) on the page.
If a page has 57 links and one CTA then the attention ratio is 57:1 (Gardner 2019, p. 1012). Marketers should strive to minimize the attention ratio, preferably to be 1:1. An ideal
attention ratio of 1:1 is obviously not practical for normal webpages such as a homepage
or product page, because all pages need navigational links, but for landing pages an
attention ratio of 1:1 is achievable. Normal pages should still strive towards a minimum
number of distractions for the sake of simplicity and ultimately user experience.
Gardner (2019, p. 17) also outlines an exception to a 1:1 attention ratio for landing pages,
that is highly relevant for product pages. If a page has multiple links that strive towards
the same goal, then the attention ratio can be higher. For example, a call to action can be
repeated many times on the same page, thus increasing the attention ratio but maintaining,
if not increasing, the potential for conversion as visitors are still guided towards the same
business driven action. If the information architecture has been strategically planned, then
most links will also take the visitor to additional relevant content that can increase his or
her chance of converting, rather than decrease it. However, this process needs to be
carefully thought out through content prioritization. Unnecessary links are considered
leaks that disrupt the conversion funnel which should be a predefined path that visitors
follow. Goward (2013, p. 232-233) also discusses that an abundance of visual and
contextual distractions increases the potential for visitors to bounce because it generates
confusion as the visitors try to localize where the most important information is placed
and what the message of the page is.
There are many models for designing the layout of pages. Among the most common ones
are the Gutenberg Rule (or diagram), the F-pattern and the Z-pattern. All these models
are based on how readers visually scan pages and consume the page content (Eldesouky
2013, p. 152). Frick and Eyler-Werve (2015, p. 83-84) describe the Gutenberg Rule as

78

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the optimal tool for webpage layout design. The Gutenberg Rule states that by default a
reader’s vision will begin by scanning at the upper left corner of the page and continue
diagonally towards the lower right. During this process the upper right receives the most
attention after the upper left, while the bottom left receives the least amount of attention
as the vision path terminates in the lower right. However, the Gutenberg Rule is generally
only applied to western cultures that read from left to right. See figure 15.
The F-pattern was developed by Jakob Nielsen as a result of eye tracking studies in the
early 2000’s. It identified that readers scant text in an F-shaped pattern, beginning from
the top right in a horizontal movement. As they go along vertically downwards, they scan
less and less to the right, decreasing the width of the horizontal movement incrementally
(Pernice 2017). See figure 15.
Figure 15: The Gutenberg Rule and the F-pattern (Eldesouky 2013, p. 152-155).

Interestingly, the Nielsen Norman Group (Pernice 2017) found in their research that the
F-pattern also applies to right-to-left languages and is not restricted to western cultures,
but it is mainly relevant when there is a lot of unformatted text on a page. Unlike the
Gutenberg Rule, the F-pattern is not a suggested model for layout design per se. It rather
emphasizes a negative aspect of how visitors consume large chunks of text, such as a
blogpost for example. When visitors scan in the F-pattern they might easily miss content
of value if it is not placed along the f shaped path. Similarly, businesses miss out on the
opportunity to convey their value proposition. Therefore, the F-pattern defines that the
79

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

top part and especially the top left is the most attention receiving position of a page, but
also that designers should negate the F-pattern through visual design and web formatting
to avoid not communicating key messages. Specifically, through the following tactics:
1.

Include the most important points in the first two paragraphs on the page.

2.

Use headings and subheadings. Ensure they look more important, and are more visible, than
normal text so users may distinguish them quickly.

3.

Start headings and subheadings with the words carrying most information: if users see only the
first 2 words, they should still get the gist of the following section.

4.

Visually group small amounts of related content — for instance, by surrounding them with a
border or using a different background.

5.

Bold important words and phrases.

6.

Take advantage of the different formatting of links and ensure that links include informationbearing words (instead of generic “go”, “click here” or “more”). This technique also improves
accessibility for users who hear links read aloud instead of scanning the content visually.

7.

Use bullets and numbers to call out items in a list or process.

8.

Cut unnecessary content.

Source: Pernice 2017.
The final pattern, the Z-pattern suggests that visitors’ eyes follow a Z-shaped pattern,
beginning in the upper left and terminating in the lower right. The Z-pattern has also been
developed into the Golden Triangle pattern and the Zig-Zag-pattern (Eldesouky 2013, p.
153-155). The Golden Triangle is formed of the first horizontal and diagonal lines of the
Z-pattern and closes these two with one vertical line. Additionally, the Zig-Zag-pattern
suggest that vision flows in a number of consecutive Z-patterns. All variations are
illustrated in figure 16.

80

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 16: The Z-, Golden Triangle- and Zig-Zag-patterns (Eldesouky 2013, p. 153-155).

All of these models suggest that the most important elements of a page or screenful should
be placed along the patterns path or in the different areas specified in the Gutenberg Rule
(Eldesouky 2013, p. 154: Frick & Eyler-Werve, p. 83-84). These elements include call to
actions, headings, lists, forms and other important elements that aid in conversion. Which
specific model marketers apply is highly dependent on the content, visual design and
visual hierarchy, information architecture, value proposition etc. No model is therefore a
definite framework, but they aid in designing usable layouts that facilitate conversion.
One page can utilize one specific model, but it can also use a combination of models
either divided by folds or even within the same fold. As with most elements in conversion
design, rigorous testing helps in defining the best method for a specific webpage and
target segment. However, as a general rule, the top of the page should be reserved for
high-priority content such as key business and visitor goals. Secondary or related
information can be accommodated in the lower parts of the page (Fessenden 2018).
5.3.3 Interactivity
“The goal of interaction design is to make it as simple and intuitive as possible for visitors
to take action on your site” (Frick & Eyler-Werve, 2015, p. 79). Web site interactions can
be defined as any number of actions that a visitor can take on a webpage. The most basic
interactions are acts that all visitors perform every time they visit a page. These can be as
simple as mouse clicks and drop-down menu selections, or slightly more advanced such
81

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

as search function interactions or drag and drop features (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 333).
Interactivity also includes larger themes on websites such as navigation schemes, blogs,
shopping cart checkout processes, contact or support forms and social media integrations
(Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 79).
Basically interaction, as the word is defined, could be as simple as a visitor viewing a
page and navigation around the page or site, thus the visitors “interacts” with the web site.
Chaffey and Smith go on to claim that interaction is not necessarily only between the
website and the visitor but also between automated systems and human interaction
facilitated through two-way communication. However, they also state that interaction in
web design is related to the amount of control and involvement the visitor has over his or
her own user experience (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 333). This is also in agreement with
Steuer’s (1992, p. 14) definition of interaction; “the extent to which users can participate
in modifying the form and content of a mediated environment in real time". Laurel (1991,
p. 29) defines interactivity as the visitors “feel” of being involved in the ongoing action,
while Wardrip-Fruin (2009, p. 75) describes interactivity in virtual environments as the
changes a visitor can make that effects the state of the system or what influence a visitor
has over future outcomes as a result of a specific interaction. To summarize, interaction
and the design of it in web design can be seen as allowing the user to take various actions
on the webpage, just as the beginning quote of this section states. Visitors reading a piece
of content is therefore, in web design terms, not interacting. It is engagement, but
interaction is reserved for conscious tasks that involve an action from the visitor.
According to Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 333-336) interaction-design can also facilitate
the buying process of visitors by moving them along the funnel. Interactive elements can
especially be useful in the learning, deciding, buying and after-sales support stages of the
funnel. Examples of interactive elements in these stages are animations and simulations
of product features, downloadable content, chats, on-site search engines, location
selection tools, feedback questionnaires etc. The presence of interactive elements
combined with an intuitive design of such elements that together improve the user
experience has been proven to have a positive effect on how visitors engage with a site
(Hoffman & Novak 1996) and that interactivity also plays a role in assessing the
credibility of a website (Harris & Goode 2010). In fact, Bauer, Grether & Leach (2002)
concluded that interactivity is a core subject when discussing online exchange in business
contexts.

Lead generation forms
For corporate websites operating in B2B lead generation, the main point of conversion is
the lead generation form, a form is the most common and intuitive way to capture
information on potential customers online (Rabhan 2013, p. 38). The importance of these
forms cannot be understated because it is the last stage of the conversion process and the
ultimate business driven action marketers optimize their websites for and want visitors to
perform. All conversion design variables such as calls to action, aesthetic appeal and
credibility signals lead to this conversion point, so success here is extremely important
(Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 191). The failure to apply a smoothness between the
navigation to the form and the steps of interactions taken on the form, in other words a
failure of flow, may result in visitors not taking action and moving to a competitor site
(Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 79). Chaffey (2012, p. 403) suggests that forms need to
achieve flow in order to deliver results. Evidently, the usability, intuitiveness,
presentation of content and design of a lead generation form is critical. All other
conversion design efforts are in vain if the form or forms have a high abandonment rate.
For corporate websites, the lead generation form might also be the most prominent
interactivity feature on a site, due to the fact that it is entirely dependent on visitor action.
Research suggests that this interaction should be made as easy and quick as possible.
Multiple academic sources and industry best practice summaries claim that forms should
ask for as little information as possible because longer forms can hurt conversions,
especially for lead generation purposes (Rothman 2014, p. 113; Frick and Eyler-Werve
2015, p. 191; Gardner 2018, p. 8; Ash 2008, p. 100; Santos 2003). This is mainly due to
the fact that long forms are overwhelming and require a significant investment of time
from the visitor (Rabhan 2013, p. 41). With visitor attention spans become shorter by the
day, this is an understandable argument. Long forms have also been found to limit flow
(Rettie 2001). There are many alternatives to long forms, and these can have different
benefits depending on target segment, market and type of service a company offers.
Rabhan (2013, p. 40-51) outlines five main types of lead generation forms; Long capture,
short capture, short-to-long capture, multistep and smooth capture.
Long capture forms typically consist of six or more data-entry fields, the number of fields
is essentially unlimited. As mentioned above, long forms generally have a negative effect
on conversions, but they can e.g. be used if companies want to screen out non-serious

83

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

buyers. Because the assumption is that serious buyers will not have a problem with filling
out all of the fields. Short capture forms are the opposite, they can be as simple as a signup
form with two data-entries. Generally, they can be from one to six fields and should ask
for the minimum amount of information required for follow-ups. The latter is true for all
variations of forms, as mentioned above. Ash (2008, p. 100) recommends asking the
question: “Is this information absolutely necessary to complete the current transaction?”
Despite the high conversion rates short forms typically have, the information they capture
might not be enough. Depending on the size of, and resources allocated to the company
sales team, more information might be required.
A Short-to-long form is a short form followed by a longer form. These forms might cause
frustration among visitors, but they have also been proven to deliver higher conversion
rates (Rabhan 2013, p. 49). The next variation of such a form is the multistep form. The
multistep form is a long form divided into multiple steps. Multistep forms require step
indicators for usability so that the visitor knows how far a long in the process they are.
These types of forms have been shown to increase conversion rates as well compared to
long capture forms (Taylor 2018). However, the multistep form according to Rabhan’s
definition, is an outdated version that requires the visitor to navigate between separate
webpages, airline checkout processes and more complex registration processes are good
examples of this. The modern multistep form is what he calls the smooth capture form.
This is a form that does not require the visitor to navigate between pages, it achieves the
same effect of a multistep form through smooth animations that gives a sense of
continuation of the same process rather than a new step, while hosted on one single page.
Many companies involved in online lead generation apply this approach and the normal
term for these forms today is that of the multistep form. In this dissertation the term
multistep form will be used when referring to a form with the same characteristics as
Rabhan’s smooth capture form. In short, the multistep form is a long form divided into
many short forms and uses animated transitions to facilitate the various steps which
results in a more intuitive process.
Overall forms should prioritize clarity and friendliness (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p.
191), feel easy and simple to complete (Hunt 2011, p. 197) and they should have clear
and concise title that describes the benefit the visitor will acquire by completing the form.
The title works as an additional persuasive incentive (Ash 2008, p. 100). Ash also states
that all descriptive labels and explanatory texts should be minimized and that forms
84

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

should not include any optional fields because these do not adhere to the “ask for the
minimum amount of information required for follow-up” rule. Shneiderman and Plaisant
(2005, p. 298) say that the instructions should be comprehensible and utilize terminology
that the visitor understands, but they also emphasize that the form should be brief and
adhere to brevity in the copy. Leake et al. (2012, p. 152) concur with minimizing forms
by stating that all “business-side ease” and “nice-to-have” questions should be avoided,
while also stating that sensitive information such as revenue and similar should not be
asked for in the form but inquired in the follow-up stage by the sales team if necessary.
Leake et al. (2012, p. 152) also suggest testing alternate versions of various design
elements such as submit button dimensions, colors etc. Shneiderman and Plaisant (2005,
p. 297) provides an extensive list of guidelines for designing usability-friendly and
converting forms:
•

Meaningful title.

•

Comprehensible instructions.

•

Logical grouping and sequencing of fields.

•

Visually appealing layout of the form.

•

Familiar field labels.

•

Consistent terminology and abbreviations.

•

Visible space and boundaries for data-entry fields.

•

Convenient cursor movement.

•

Error correction for individual characters and entire fields.

•

Error prevention where possible.

•

Error messages for unacceptable values.

•

Marking of optional fields.

•

Explanatory messages for fields.

•

Completion signal to support user control.

Most of these guidelines have been touched upon to an extent already, but the visual
appeal, use of white space and boundaries, and the logical grouping are noteworthy.
85

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Shneiderman and Plaisant also mention the importance of error messages. According to
Goward (2013, p. 215) visitors can feel a sense of stupidity due to poor form design and
arcane and stark (usually red) error messages, making visitors feel stupid or blamed
obviously leads to a negative user experience. Forms should accommodate visitors in a
friendly way, and they should be allowed to recover from errors easily as this will result
in improved conversion rates. Additionally, Frick and Eyler-Werve (2015, p. 192) suggest
always left aligning both fields and copy in forms, responsive form design for a wide
range of devices and avoid cluttering forms with unnecessary design elements.

5.4 Credibility
Many marketing practitioners (Goward 2013; Hunt 2011; Leake et al. 2012; Rothman
2014) highlight the importance of visitor trust in conversion optimization and lead
generation. Service marketing professionals (Harris & Goode 2010; Santos 2003;
Karvonen 2000) argue that trust is one of the most important quality determinants in
customers’ assessment of service quality. In fact, trust is said to be the fundamental
principle for creating conversions, and that the role of trust in e-servicescapes such as
websites is far more important than in physical servicescapes. This is due to the lack of
human-to-human interaction in e-servicescapes (Harris & Goode 2010; Ribbink, van Riel,
Liljander & Streukens 2004).
New approaches are needed to build trust between seller and buyer in the digital world
because the regular trust building practices such as human contact are at best impractical,
but normally completely absent (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 176). Companies must
therefore manage to persuade visitors of their credibility merely through the design and
content of their websites. The trust needed to convert is not only related to the visitor
trusting that the service provider is truthful and has good intentions, they also need to be
convinced of the value the service provides. Consequently, the corporate website must
satisfy issues related to legitimacy and visitors’ privacy, but also satisfy or exceed
expectations of service or product quality.
Visitor trust can be interpreted as a reflection of company credibility, because trust is
evoked in the visitor through the credibility of the website, i.e. a credible site builds visitor
trust (Everard & Galletta 2006, p. 60). Fogg and Tseng (1999) describe this credibility as

86

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

a mix of trust and expertise, where trust refers to the goodness and accuracy of the
company and expertise refers to knowledge, experience and competence of the company.
Harris and Goode (2010, p. 232) state in their model that trust in the website is the
constitutional link between all design elements and visitors’ purchase intentions (see
section 4.2.4, figure 10). Ojasalo and Puhakainen (2004) also concluded that if visitors
experience a lack of trust on the web, they are unlikely to perform any transaction or to
engage with the business in question further. Moreover, Everard and Galletta (2003)
found that flaws in the design has a strong correlation with declining purchase intentions
on websites. By flaws, the authors refer to technical factors such as errors and
incompleteness in the design, but also to poor style which they define as interfering
graphical elements, inconsistent copy styling and improperly formatted tables. Flaws
diminish the perceived service quality of the site which in turn leads to diminished trust
and a low intention to purchase. These findings also correlate with the study done by Fogg
et al. (2003) which revealed that website visitors value the look of the design and the
structure of information when judging credibility, as discussed in section 5.1.
The link between usability, aesthetics and credibility is evident, and it is safe to assume
that if the design and content of a website does not portray credibility and consequently
does not evoke trust, then the chance of conversion is minimal. Important to remember is
that visitors are wary of their privacy on the web and by completing in a lead generation
form for example, they are putting their own personal privacy at risk (Rothman 2014, p.
115). Therefore, visitors must be convinced that the value they will receive outweighs the
trouble of converting, and that the website is secure enough to risk giving up their
personal information.
It is arguable that B2B buyers are not as sensitive with their personal information as B2C
consumers since they are operating in the name of their employer rather than as private
individuals, i.e. they would have a lower threshold for converting. However, no such
evidence has been found, B2B and B2C visitors display an equal amount of prejudice and
skepticism towards online services as the individual’s values and beliefs stay constant.
However, the rationale for this attitude can vary. B2C-consumers greatest concern tends
to be personal security. B2B buyers, while cautious of personal security, also want to
avoid any and all risks of a business venture failing, which includes the careful selection
of possible service providers (Leake et al. 2012, p. 144). Also, Leake et al. (2012, p. 19)

87

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

explain that both business and consumer branding efforts are dependent on trust between
buyer and seller, meaning that trust in a brand is highly relevant for B2B buyers. Chaffey
and Smith (2013, p. 160) further state that people trust well-known brands and that some
brands are even trusted more than governmental institutions.
The importance of brand trust is evident for overall company credibility and for a business
that mainly markets itself through online channels and a corporate website, the website is
the main channel where brand trust can be influenced. Expressing credibility through the
corporate website therefore has far reaching implications for online businesses and is not
only relevant for the practice of optimizing website conversions, a lack of visitor trust can
result in buyers generating a negative perception of the brand as a whole. Additionally,
creating a trustworthy website aids in SEO efforts. Search engines use mainly site
popularity and trust to determine if a website is credible or spam (Frick & Eyler-Werve
2015, p. 52). The trust that search engines refer to is based on visitor engagement with
the site and how many other websites link to the site in question. Meaning that the trust
of the visitors is needed to generate search engine trust.
Creating trust through design is affected by multiple factors, e.g. brand names, complete
sites without obvious flaws, privacy and security statements, online communities and
refund policies help in building trust (Everard & Galletta 2006, p. 60). Many factors are
related to the content, design and usability of the site. Goward (2013, p. 217) goes as far
as stating that; “You can make all the conversion-optimization improvements imaginable,
but if there are technical glitches on your website, all credibility is lost”. This highlights
the importance of a functional website in the creation of trust, but credibility is also
largely dependent on meeting visitor needs. Questions such as does it have a proven track
record, do others use it, and will you deliver, are typical questions that visitors go through
when researching a site (Hunt 2011, p. 164).
Visitors need reasons that confirm they are moving in the right direction, and effectively
reasons that answer questions such as the above. Hunt (2011, p. 164) calls these reasons
affirming positives, signs that reassure the visitor of the value proposition and credibility
of the company, thus persuading the visitor of the fact that this is the right provider for
him or her. This is mainly achieved through copy. The style of writing can inspire
credibility, but the copy can also talk about specific topics such as guarantees,
achievements and awards to do this, or provide proof of concept through testimonials and

88

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

endorsements (Rabhan 2013, p. 110). Specific symbols such as icons or images can also
contribute to credibility. The following sections will discuss various credibility signals
that can be used in copy and design of corporate websites to increase credibility and evoke
trust.
5.4.1 Social proof
Kim and Kim (2003) describe social influence as the social effect other people’s opinions
have on you when determining whether or not to adopt a new technology or purchase a
product. In fact, many social psychology studies have shown that people can change their
mind or beliefs based on the opinions of others (Goward 2013, p. 129). In marketing, this
has been acknowledged for a long time and the fact that people tend to be drawn to things
that other people like or value is not new. For this reason, marketers try to provide
evidence that other people have purchased or are satisfied with a product and/or service,
this evidence is commonly known as social proof (Goward 2013, p. 128). Due to the
general distrust of websites and resulting importance of credibility combined with the
short attention span of visitors, social proof is very important in conversion design.
Social proof creates a level of authentic believability that gives visitors an impression of
high quality as others have deemed the quality provided to be adequate (Gardner 2018, p.
34). This is the essence of persuasion in conversion design, most visitors will not take a
company’s word at face-value unless it is a trusted brand, so messages and symbols that
indicate social proof must be present on a webpage. Many credibility signals can be
classified as social proof, essentially all types of third-party validation such as reviews,
social shares, testimonials, security certifications etc. are a type of social proof because
they are indications of credibility bestowed on the seller by others, hence “social”. In
short, social proofing is “based on transferring goodwill from other people or companies
to yours” (Ash 2008, p. 92).
Customer ratings and reviews are two good versions of social proof. “Incorporating star
ratings and comments can add authenticity to a site and help increase conversion rates”
(Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 334). Especially e-commerce sites should incorporate reviews
as visitors want to know the personal experience of others before they purchase a product.
In B2B however, reviews per se are not necessarily that applicable, it depends on the
character of the service. While B2B e-commerce sites would surely benefit from reviews,
89

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

B2B lead generation websites that are bound to a longer sales cycle may be better of using
testimonials, endorsements and other social proof signals.
Client testimonials usually take the form of a quote on a webpage. Clients make a positive
statement regarding the value they have received which can then be added to the copy of
the webpage. Today, many companies also incorporate testimonials in videos through
client interviews. A testimonial is similar to a review with the exception of being a direct
and short quote regarding a specific product or service. A review tends to be a free-form
opinion on something specific and can be both negative and positive as it is an evaluation.
In contrast, a testimonial is specifically written to highlight something positive and is as
such not an evaluation but a praise. Testimonials should persuade others of the value
proposition, and preferably they should be written by peers in the same industry as the
webpage visitor. People are persuaded by others who they like or that are like them, so
endorsements from people known to the target segment or people that the target segment
can relate to have the greatest impact on credibility (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 185).
Especially buyers in B2B want the affirmation that others within their industry are using
the business in question and that it has a strong reputation in that industry (Leake et al.
2012, p. 30-31).
Goward (2013, p. 130) also points out that using client logos, either in addition to, or in
place of testimonials is a good way to showcase existing clients to visitors. Logos are
generally better than merely listing brands, due to the brand credibility a logo embodies.
Goward (2013, p. 126-127) also describes case studies as the most powerful tool for
creating credibility on websites. With case studies, marketers can demonstrate how
existing clients have benefitted from a service or product. When visitors see how a seller’s
product or service has solved the problems of their industry peers, they can envision how
it could work for them as well. Case studies are normally presented in a written format or
through slides on the web, but the increase in popularity of video consumption makes
video with dedicated client interviews a very good option for case studies.
Finally, social media is a good social proof tool due to its reliability. People can directly
see the profiles of others who engage with a corporate social media account, making their
statements more credible. Testimonials on the website for example are not as genuine
because there is no way for visitors to tell if they are true or not (Goward 2013, p. 30).
However, with regard to the corporate website itself, social media can be utilized by e.g.

90

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

displaying number of social shares, having a live feed to a social media account or sharing
recommendations and reviews originally posted on social media.
5.4.2 Performance and security indicators
Performance indicators are a good way of portraying the quality of a service. Hunt (2011,
p. 171-173) emphasizes the importance of providing details through numbers and
showing evidence when designing for credibility. Numbers and statistics have been
proven to increase credibility, and evidence that support a value proposition is a lot better
than just a statement. Good evidence can be various types of social proof such as
testimonials, as explained in the previous section. However, it can also be other elements
of third-party validation or statistics that only the company behind the website can
provide. For example, number of customers or similar can boost credibility because
humans tend to think that “if many others use it, it must be good” (Goward 2013, p. 124134). Third-party validation such as media mentions gives the site some of the media’s
brand credibility because it shows that the media in question has trusted the company.
Awards can indicate that the company is an industry leader or give credibility to the value
proposition. Additionally, professional reviews from media or respected industry leaders,
or symbols for other third-party validation standards such as TRUSTe or Fair Trade shows
credibility, and in many cases indicate security (Goward 2013, p. 124; Hunt 2011, p. 174175).
Visitors are inherently skeptical on the web due to the insecurities the web presents with
its high number of privacy invasions, identify theft and various types of fraud or scams
(Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 161). Therefore, they need security indicators that signals that
the site is secure, i.e. it can be trusted with personal information and it is not a scam or
fraud. This might well be the final hurdle to overcome in the conversion funnel as visitors
might think twice before completing the form even though they have been convinced of
the value. Having a clear and accessible privacy policy is important at this stage to
reassure the most skeptical visitors. Adding a link to the privacy policy directly in the
lead generation form increases the likelihood of visitors converting into a lead (Halligan
& Shah 2014, p. 121-122). This type of promise of handling personal information with
care from seller to buyer should always be present when asking for visitors’ details (Hunt
2011, p. 174).

91

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Both Hunt (2011, p. 174) and Harris and Goode (2010, p. 238) also mention that the
presence of a simple phone number makes visitors feel more secure because it indicates
that there are real people they could call if needed. As mentioned in section 5.3.1, visitors
also expect the company logo to be present on every page. This is not only relevant in a
usability context but in a credibility context as well. Visitors need to be assured of the
fact that they are still on the same website to avoid confusion and feelings of insecurity
that can lead to distrust. This is also achieved through context and consistency in the
design (Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 330-331). Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 323) also point
out that visitors spend most of their time on other sites and not yours, meaning that they
expect all sites to be similar to the ones they visit most often. Deviations in common
design can therefore lead to a loss of credibility. Not having the logo at the top as
mentioned above is an example of such deviation. Apart from other common usability
practices, visitors expect to find security indicators such as contact information and the
privacy policy in the footer of every webpage (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 147;
Chaffey & Smith 2013, p. 320).
Harris and Goode (2010) also found that financial security is one of the main categories
that lead to trust and increased purchase intentions. Financial security, as Harris and
Goode define it, is mainly related to webpages where a financial transaction takes place,
such as an e-commerce website. However, other scholars also highlight security in
general as a quality determinant and trust enabler in e-servicescapes such as websites. To
visitors, security means that they are free from danger, risk or doubt and is related to both
financial security and security of sensitive personal information (Santos 2003; Yang et al.
2004). Some security symbols are expected by visitors, and are also web development
standards, such as a valid SSL certificate for example. Visitors that provide payment
details can also expect a padlock or other type of security certification symbol (Hunt 2011,
p. 176). Google also requires websites that contain input fields to be served over https,
otherwise a “Not secure” warning will be shown in the url address field to visitors who
use Google Chrome, while sites that Chrome deems secure have a padlock icon in this
position (Lawrance 2016).
Visitor trust is evoked from credibility throughout a website, meaning that it is affected
by all elements throughout conversion design. Tangible benefits such as the value
proposition itself, features, offers and other incentives for example play a role in painting
a credible picture. Professionalism in both aesthetics, content and usability matter as well,
92

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

while rich information provided through content marketing adds to a brand’s identity as
a leader and innovator (Goward 2013, p. 118-125). Credibility is therefore an integral part
throughout lead generation and conversion design, but it can also be influenced by the
specific elements listed in the sections above.

5.5 The effect of design on the conversion rate
Based on the findings in this literature review, a hypothesized model was put forward (see
figure 17). The model works as the basis for the content analysis of the designs on the
subject page which will be presented in chapter 6. It takes influences from the EServicescapes model developed by Harris and Goode (2010, p. 232) that was presented
in section 4.2.4 (see figure 10).
The model builds upon the four main dimensions for conversion design that where
depicted already in section 4.3 and that have been researched in detail throughout this
chapter: aesthetics, content, usability and credibility. The dimensions have now been
developed further by the addition of separate conversion determinants for each
dimension. These determinants depict specific on-page elements of a webpage that
visitors have been found to consider when evaluating a site, that enhances the user
experience and that have been proven to increase conversions.
Aesthetics refers to elements that generate visual appeal for the visitors. These elements
revolve heavily around visual hierarchy that indicate the level of importance of different
pieces of information. The main conversion determinants for creating visual appeal are
typography, color & contrast, and imagery. Through the placement, structure, styling and
hierarchy of these elements, webpages can generate visual appeal and a positive first
impression.
The content on the page, including the copy, CTAs and visitor tailored content should
satisfy the visitors’ needs, i.e. answer all questions visitors might have, while it also
should facilitate the business goal. The content on the page is what ultimately convinces
potential buyers to convert. In order to do this the presented content should provide
relevance, credibility and value for the visitors and should be presented in a manner that
facilitates readability, scannability and a logical structural hierarchy through e.g.
headings, paragraphs and lists.

93

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Usability is related to the ease of use of the website. Logical and clear navigation that
constantly communicate to the visitor where in the information architecture he or she is
must be developed. The layout should be structured so that high-value content, from both
the visitor and the business perspective, is easily identifiable and presented quickly
through the use of e.g. the Gutenberg Rule. The layout and navigation should also adhere
to simplicity to not create a confusing user experience. A website should also incorporate
features of interactivity that makes the visitors feel in control of their actions. The lead
generation form is one of the most critical interactivity components of a usable lead
generation site. The ultimate goal of usability is for visitors to easily navigate, understand
and find information on the page, thus achieving a state of flow.
Credibility relates to evoking visitor trust in the website and subsequently trust in the
company. All categories in the model relate to portraying a credible image, e.g. a visually
appealing design can have a positive effect on credibility, but certain elements such as
social proof that mainly consists of third-party validation, and performance and security
indicators can be leveraged in the design to increase credibility and provide a sense of
security for visitors. Figure 17 illustrated the hypothesized model of conversion design
including all the conversion dimensions and determinants mentioned above.
Figure 17: Hypothesized model for conversion design of corporate websites.

94

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

The aim of a conversion centered website is firstly to achieve the set business goal, which
in this case is a submitted lead generation form which translates into an increased
conversion rate, but secondly conversion design should also achieve the visitor’s goal.
The visitor goal is a prerequisite to the business goal. By incorporating the conversion
determinants in the design, marketers can enhance the user experience and thus the
perceived service quality of the website. When achieving this improved level of quality,
the business goal of an increased conversion rate can be achieved.
Balancing the business goal and the visitor’s goal can theoretically be confusing.
However, to clarify, conversion design practices and usability are not the same, but they
are also not in conflict, as was explained in section 4.3. They are highly related to one
another. Enhancing the user experience through usability and efficient copy can by itself
have a positive impact on conversions, but adding conversion design principles in the
design process aids in tailoring the page to the target audience and in maximizing the
page’s effectiveness, both regarding conversions and improved service quality (Leake et
al. 2012, p. 142).

5.6 Chapter summary
This chapter has taken an in-depth look at design and usability factors that affect the
conversion rate of the corporate website. Through a literature review of existing literature
and research related to web design, servicescapes, CRO, LPO and UCD, presented in this
chapter and chapter 4, a hypothesized model was created that uses the fundamental
dimensions of conversion design depicted in section 4.3 as a basis. The model (presented
in section 5.5) further elaborates these categories by defining the main on-page elements
and quality determinants that constitutes optimal conversion design as conversion
determinants. With this model as the guiding framework, the coding manual (see
appendix H) was created so that the old and new design of the case-company webpage
can be analyzed to determine how well they incorporate the conversion design principles
of the hypothesized model.

6 DESIGN OF THE CASE-COMPANY WEBSITE
This chapter will present the case study results by beginning with a detailed look into the
evaluation of the case-company subject page. Firstly, the evaluation results of the old
design will be presented, and secondly the results of the new design. Both versions have
been evaluated through the coding manual (see appendix H). In conclusion, the main
differences and possible improvements between the two designs will be summarized, and
the actual difference in conversion rate will be presented by the use of quantitative data
consisting of web analytics metrics from Google Analytics.

6.1 Evaluation of the old design
This section will present the evaluation results of the old webpage design based on the
findings in the coding schedule of the old design (see appendix I). The presentation of the
findings will only focus on the most important conversion determinants that the analysis
has identified to avoid repeating what was established in the literature review in chapters
4 and 5. Therefore, the results presented here and in the evaluation of the new design
(section 6.2) will not go through every aspect of conversion design mentioned in earlier
chapters, nor will it go through everything from the coding schedule. It will, however,
focus on the most essential elements of the old design that are of relevance from a
conversion standpoint. Complete screenshots of the old design can be seen in appendix
F.
6.1.1 Aesthetics
Aesthetically the visual design is very pleasing. It is simple and elegant and does not
include elements that distract the visitor’s attention from the main elements of the page.
The webpage design is based on material design principles which facilities a very usable
visual hierarchy (Turajlic 2018). The visual hierarchy is well balanced overall. Headings
are clearly distinguishable from copy and the product images on the page are
proportionally large to mark their hierarchical importance. They draw visitor attention to
the offered products and give the visitor a preview of what the products might look like.
Vector illustrations are also used to illustrate the features of the service offering which
makes the content more understandable for the visitor. The imagery in general supports
96

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the value proposition of the page, which is the main reason for the use of images in
conversion design, and it also makes the service offering more tangible for the visitor
(Goward 2013, p. 186). However, the imagery does not make use of other directional or
visual ques apart from the product images.
The typographical structures also enhance the visual hierarchy and appeal of the design.
The sans-serif typefaces Montserrat and Roboto are the two fonts used. Montserrat is
reserved for headings and high value elements such as links, while Roboto is used for the
copy on the page. Both typefaces make the content of the page clearly readable and
understandable. The use of font-sizes and capitalization for certain elements also
improves readability and makes the content scannable, as the visitor quickly and easily
can separate headings from copy and thus choose what content to engage with further.
From a purely aesthetical standpoint, the first impression of the page is good. The design
and color choices are visually pleasing, comprehendible and indicates professionality.
However, the excessive use of white space and low amount of content in the first screenful
fails to deliver the value proposition to its full potential. The first screenful is the greatest
weakness of the old design due to the lack of content and high value elements. Because
the issues mostly regard the readable content and missing elements from the first screenful
it will be evaluated more thoroughly in the next section, 6.1.2, the layout of the first
screenful will also be touched upon in section 6.1.3.
Colors and contrasts
The webpage consistently uses the brand colors as the main color palette for the design,
with the only additional color being a very dark grey (#333333) for some parts of the
copy. The colors used on the webpage are illustrated in figure 18. The brand color palette
is made up of cool colors, which is in line with Coursaris’ et al. (2008) study and are also
fitting for a B2B company aiming to portray a professional and credible image. The
background colors vary from light to dark, specifically, white (#FFFFFF), light grey
(#EBEDEF) and dark blue (#25323A) are used as backgrounds. The shade of the dark
blue is somewhat different from the one presented in figure 18, as it has a small amount
of transparency to portray a static background image that scrolls with the content (see
appendix F: 3, 10).

97

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 18: The color palette used on the old webpage design.

The background image gives a nice visual effect when the visitor navigates the page.
However, having a background image for purely aesthetical purposes is debatable. In
conversion design form should follow function (Goward 2013, p. 182), and a background
image that is purely aesthetical and does not support the value proposition or aid in the
visitor’s goal is not in line with this notion. There should be a balance between aesthetics
and functional design (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 62), the background image used in the
old design does not violate that, but it is noteworthy that it does not have any functional
purpose for achieving the visitor or business goal. Additionally, a neutral background is
preferred to images because images can avert the visitor’s attention from the content on
the page (Everard & Galletta 2006, p. 66).
The use of the dark background color (#25323A) in some sections of the page works well
as it helps in separating the blocks of content from one another and the darker blocks are
not too long, which is good because large blocks of light text on dark backgrounds can
create eye fatigue. The font-size is also adequate, which is important because if the lighter
text is too small it can have a negative effect on readability (Goward 2013, p. 193).
The level of contrast between on-page elements is also satisfactory, elements are clearly
separated from one another and there is no section that limits readability or scannability
98

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

due to a lack of contrast. The light blue color (#29C1E6) is used as a highlighter to
emphasize certain elements on the page, which supports the overall design. Of all the
colors in the palette the light blue is also the most obvious choice for this purpose. With
regard to highlighting high value elements, the use of the light blue should be revised as
it is not reserved exclusively for this purpose (see appendix F: 3, 4, 5, 7). As the
highlighting color, it should be reserved for CTAs, links and headings or other elements
that the visitor’s attention should be guided towards. The one negative aspect of the light
blue itself, is that it is fairly similar to the generic blue used for hyperlinks across the web,
which can confuse visitors as it is more difficult to separate links from copy.
6.1.2 Content
The greatest flaw of the written content on the page is the lack of it. The existing content
is not in any sense poor, but the majority of the page, especially the first half, which
consists of the first screenful and the product presentation area (see appendix F: 1, 2, 3),
is mainly visual and not that contextual. The positives of the low amount of content is
that it is easily scannable and readable, but so are the portions of the page that has more
content, i.e. more content would not hurt either scannability or readability but might
instead improve the communication of the value proposition and provide more additional
incentives to convert. Listing additional benefits would be easy through e.g. bulleted lists.
The copy does have a balance of both customer-centric and company-centric tone-ofvoice but does tend to lean more to the company-centric, presenting the service offering
for its features rather than focusing on the benefits the buyer will gain from the service.
The first half of the page feels like a product brochure, which can work for some visitors,
but is a waste of digital real estate when considering the potential that the page has. The
presentation of the content is however, disregarding the issues mentioned above, properly
divided into comprehendible paragraphs and headings, the headings support the content
and the copy sounds professional but not too stiff.
First screenful and first impression
Even though the visual design is pleasing, the first impression a visitor can have is that
the first screenful is very empty. This can generate a feeling of incompleteness or that the
page has little to offer, causing the visitor to bounce off the page. Simplicity is important

99

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

in visual design and the first screenful facilitates that, but simplicity in content is not
necessarily equally good. The first screenful of the old design can be seen in figure 19.
Figure 19: The first screenful of the old design at 1920 x 1080 screen resolution.

Simplicity in visual design should facilitate the business and visitor goals by focusing
attention on the right elements. The first screenful does achieve that, or it does focus
attention on the main elements visible in the viewport, but that does not mean that the
elements presented are the “right” elements. For example, the first screenful does not
include any benefit statements for the visitor, rather it presents the products, as mentioned.
It does not include a call to action, except for the ‘Contact us’ button in the navigation
menu (see appendix F: 6), which uses very generic copy and is not highlighted to stand
out of the design through color, contrast, encapsulation or any other technique. The main
heading is the brand name of the product, which does not give any real value to the visitor
because the brand name itself is not very descriptive of what the page is about nor the
benefit the visitor might receive from engaging further. Analyzing the first screenful
according to Gadner’s (2018) mini landing page model and the so called five-point punch,
the first screenful of the old design only satisfies one of the five elements, which in this
case is the sub-heading (see figure 19 above and figure 12 in section 5.2).
The first screenful needs to deliver the most important information at first glance to the
visitor in order to convince them of; a) staying on the site in the first place, b) converting,
100

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

or c) researching the service offering further by scrolling down. The old design does not
achieve this. The content that is presented is decent; the sub-heading describes what the
content is about, it includes images with explanatory copy, it indicates for whom the
products are meant (‘For guests’), it utilizes the light blue as a highlighter and the content
is clear and scannable. However, the first screenful is the most crucial of areas on any
webpage and from a conversion design standpoint there are a lot of improvements that
could be made.
Call to action
As stated above, the topmost call to action is the ‘Contact us’ button in the navigation
menu. Having a call to action in the navigation menu is very good as it is constantly
visible while the visitors navigate the page, but it should also be highlighted in some way
so that it stands out and it should avoid very generic copy. The navigation menu call to
action in the old design fails on both of these accounts. In addition to the navigation menu
call to action, a CTA should also always be included in the first screenful.
The main CTA of the page is at the bottom. This CTA area, including client logos as
social proof and a light blue highlighted CTA button is a good representation of a
webpage call to action, see figure 20.
Figure 20: The call to action area at the bottom of the page in the old design.

However, this call to action has room for improvement as well. Call to actions should
strive to describe the benefit the visitor will receive from converting and what the action
of converting will result in from the visitor’s perspective. This is mainly achieved through
persuasive copy: action-oriented verbs, descriptive headings, benefit descriptions or lists
etc., combined with placement of this copy in relevant context so that the flow of content
forms a natural path from first landing on the page, to converting. The CTA area
illustrated in figure 20 does not fulfill these criteria. The combination of client references
101

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

and the CTA button is good, but as with many elements of the old design, the CTA area
does not live up to its full potential.
Visitor needs and content placement
The old design does a relatively good job of facilitating multiple visitor needs and
journeys. The AIDA model can be identified from the page as the content gets more
detailed the farther down the visitor scrolls. At the top the various product segments are
presented which create interest, after which the design tries to evoke desire by
communicating the company’s unique selling points as well as the benefits of the
product’s and company’s technical solution (see appendix F: 2, 7, 10). The CTA area at
the bottom of the page represents the action stage where visitors hopefully convert (see
appendix F: 8). Having a CTA at the bottom of the page can create great leaps in
conversion rates, and it is also good practice to greet visitors that have spent the time to
read through the whole page with a logical and business driven exit strategy instead of a
generic footer that just forces the visitors to scroll back up (Rabhan 2013, p. 150). Despite
the good use of the AIDA, the initial stage, i.e. the awareness stage, is inadequate due to
the issues of the first screenful, as mentioned throughout. The fact that the first screenful
does not provide the most important information briefly, means that the needs of potential
quick converters are being neglected.
The design is neatly separated into blocks through the use of different background colors
which helps visitors scan and find the specific piece of content that is most relevant to
them. The content also facilitates research-minded visitors as the content gets more
detailed further down the page and speaks to both technical and non-technical visitors,
but the degree of importance and the placement of the various content pieces is not
optimal. The inverted pyramid model suggests beginning with the most important content
and then adding content in a decreasing manner of importance (Ash 2012, p. 133). In the
old design the most important and valuable content is in the second half of the page,
effectively flipping the pyramid back to its original and flawed axis.
This is obviously subjective, to some visitors the content in the first half of the page, the
product presentation (see appendix F: 2), can be more important than the content in the
second half. The fact that the products are listed is therefore good, because many visitors
are interested in the tangible products that make up a large portion of the service offering.
The product section also gives a good overview of the products, making it easy for visitors
102

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

to quickly scan and find the products they are most interested in. It also makes sense from
a marketing perspective to place the product offering high up on the page. However, when
analyzing the content on a page-level, thus disregarding the links to more detailed product
pages in the product section of the page (see appendix F: 3), then the most informative
and valuable content from a buyer’s perspective is in the second half. This is due to the
same issue mentioned regarding the first screenful, i.e. the lack of information. The first
half of the page essentially forces visitors to navigate to the more detailed product pages
if they want to know more, meaning that they cannot convert on the subject page. Some
visitors might be convinced by a little additional information that could easily be hosted
on the page. To summarize, the issue with the page-level content is not directly related to
what content is placed where, rather to the fact that the second half is significantly more
informative than the first.
Of course, the objective of the product section might be to direct visitors toward the
detailed product pages, but that does not negate the fact that the subject page is inadequate
from a conversion design point of view. The business goal is to make visitors convert,
and the fewer steps they need to take to achieve that, the better. It is noteworthy though,
that the links to the product pages are part of an orthodox exit strategy that is in place in
the old design. Every page should have an exit strategy that guides visitors to the next
step they need to take to reach a conversion point (Rabhan 2013, p. 149), in the old design
the main exit points are the call to action button and the product page links. For many
research-minded and product interested visitors the links are a step in the right direction.
6.1.3 Usability
Many usability aspects, such as layout and simplicity have already been discussed in
section 6.1.1 and 6.1.2. However, the above sections have examined these factors from
the perspective of content and aesthetics. When focusing on usability alone, the
perspective becomes one that focuses on ease of use and user experience.
Layout and simplicity
The old design is simple, elegant and clean. It does not include any distractions that takes
away from the copy or high value elements on the page. The attention ratio of the page is
39:3 which is good considering that 24 of the link leaks on the page are either in the
navigation menu or the footer. The attention ratio of the unique page content is therefore
103

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

6:1 (one of the CTAs is in the navigation menu and one in the footer). However, all
outgoing links from a page should be considered as equal leaks, so limiting the navigation
menu items and links in the footer could benefit the user experience and make the page
more focused for its visitors.
With regard to the layout of the page, it has already been established that the page follows
the AIDA model and that the visual hierarchy, sizing of elements, visuals, headings and
paragraphs facilitate scannability and good readability. The block design separates
content and foldpages from one another (see appendix F: 7, 8, 10). Additionally, the
AIDA model is good for generating a state of flow. As a visitor scrolls down the page and
goes through the various steps of the AIDA, eventually reaching the CTA at the bottom
of the page and terminating at the lead generation form, the visitor can feel a state of
control over the user experience.
Except from the AIDA, the old design does not seem to incorporate any of the
recommended content structures in the layout. The Gutenberg Rule or mini landing page
model could significantly increase readability, provide valuable content to the visitors
and more effectively drive business goals, i.e. conversions. The most notable area that
could be developed with this in mind is the first screenful.
The design does do an adequate job of negating visitors’ tendencies to read in the skipping
manner of the F-pattern. The short paragraphs and low amount of written text facilitates
this. Not to say that the low amount of content is an overall positive, as has been
mentioned multiple times.
Navigation and interactivity
The webpage itself is relatively short in length so navigating around the page is not an
issue. The whole site is also relatively small when compared to larger websites that can
have hundreds of pages. The website utilizes a broad and shallow information architecture
which is suitable for its small scale, but it also results in the navigation menu having 8
items, 9 if you count the clickable logo on the far left (see appendix F: 11, 12), which is
a high number of menu items. The clickable logo, however, is a positive since it assures
the visitors that they remain on the same site. Having the logo visible at all times also
makes sure that visitors do not become lost as they can always navigate back to the
homepage. The navigation menu, including the logo, sticks to the top edge of the visitor’s
viewport and is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the page, meaning that it is
104

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

constantly and clearly visible as the visitors scroll and thus improves navigation. The
menu is visible and has the same design on every page of the website which is good for a
consistent user experience when navigating. It also includes expected items such as the
mentioned logo for the homepage but also an ‘about’ and ‘contact’ item.
Figure 21: The navigation menu of the old design.

The fact that the site uses a broad and shallow approach is good with regard to visitors
not having to dig very deep int the page hierarchy to find what they are looking for.
However, the fact that the main navigation only lists top-level pages that are at the highest
level of the information architecture (see level 1 in appendix K) forces possible sub-pages
(see level 2 and 3 in appendix K) to be linked on-page. This can contribute to sub-pages
and specific information being difficult to find and consequently to a confusing user
experience for visitors, especially if there are many links on a page.
In the case of the old design there are six sub-pages linked from the subject page, out of
which one is hidden behind an interactive scroll menu feature, meaning the visitor must
manually use the scroll feature to find the link (see appendix F: 7). It is debatable how
intuitive these sub-page links are, i.e. is the page layout clear enough so that visitors
intuitively understand how to navigate to the sub-pages to access further information.
This combined with the use of the light blue for both highlighting elements and links as
mentioned in section 6.1.1 can make navigation more difficult. However, it can be
concluded that the product page links (see appendix F: 3) are intuitive enough but that
there is room for improvement, especially due to the lack of content in this area as
discussed in the previous section. The fact that sub-pages are not findable through the
main navigation increases the importance of the on-page navigation and layout to
facilitate a pleasing user experience. Apart from clearly separating various pieces of
content within the same context and marking links for intuitive flow in the design, a
secondary navigation menu could assist in the on-page navigation.
Furthermore, the page does not indicate where on the website the visitor is located, i.e.
there are no communicative elements such as a breadcrumb navigation trail or a menu
item highlighter that shows the visitors where they are. This is especially bad for
navigation flow after a visitor has navigated deeper into the information architecture. If a
105

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

visitor has navigated to a sub-page of a sub-page of the main page for example, he or she
has no indication that reassures that he or she is still within the same subject page category
of content.
The scroll menu mentioned above is a nice interactivity feature that can increase
engagement from visitors. As Santos (2003, p. 239) describes, webpage visitors value
animations, which includes moving elements. Stacking content horizontally instead of
vertically also diminishes the page length, which in turn facilitates the lack of scrolling
displayed by website visitors (Fessenden 2018). The CTA button at the bottom of the
page (see appendix F: 5) is also well designed with an interactive hover effect that adds
some transparency to the button when hovered on with the mouse. This combined with
the button shape of the CTA clearly indicates that it is a clickable element.
Lead generation form
The lead generation form is not constantly visible on the page, it pops up over the entirety
of the viewport at the click of any of the CTA buttons (see appendix F: 5, 6). The form
has the dark blue background color (#25323A) combined with white (#FFFFFF) text and
input fields to make it stand out from the background, the light blue (#29C1E6) is used
for the button. This focuses attention on the form itself as there are no un-related
distracting elements present on the page which would be the case if the form was hosted
directly on the page. Having the form pop up also eliminates the need for encapsulation
or other techniques designed to make the form stand out. The contrast of the background
and the input fields already achieve this.
Figure 22: The lead generation form of the old design.

106

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

The structure and design of the form generates a clear path for conversion, there is no
uncertainty regarding what a visitor is expected to do. The topmost input fields ask
generic questions which allows the visitor to begin with something easy. As it continues
into more difficult questions regarding the visitor’s interest in the product offering, the
form provides interactive dropdown menus which makes it intuitive for the visitor to fill
in the relevant information.
The first dropdown menu has a preselected option based on which webpage the visitor
has navigated to the form from. In the case of the subject webpage that preselection is
Hospitality TV (see figure 22 and appendix F: 23). This design component has a positive
intention but is flawed in its execution. The preselection is presumably designed to
decrease the actions that the visitor must complete to convert. However, an additional
feature of the first dropdown is that it triggers a second compulsory dropdown once the
visitor has selected something in the first one, see figure 23.
Figure 23: The selection in the first dropdown triggers a second dropdown.

This automated trigger is not launched due to the preselection, resulting in an error
message upon completion of the form because the visitor has missed a compulsory field.
A field that the visitor has never even seen. Even the error indicators and messages that
appear as the visitor tries to convert fail to clearly indicate which field is incomplete as
the secondary dropdown is still not showing, see figure 24. Errors are otherwise shown
with clear red markings that indicate which fields still needs to be edited and the form has
polite error messages that ask the visitor to complete the missing steps (appendix F: 13,
14).

107

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Figure 24: Error messages and indicators shown due to the incomplete secondary
dropdown. The secondary dropdown is still failing to appear at this stage.

Only when a visitor actively clicks the primary dropdown and selects another option than
the preselected one, will the secondary dropdown appear. Clicking the same preselected
value (‘Hospitality TV’) will not trigger the secondary dropdown, only an actual change
from the preselected value will trigger it. This is a significant bottleneck to overcome for
visitors as it creates a direct barrier for converting, only by the visitor’s conscious action
to manually solve the problem will the conversion be allowed to follow through. It is
arguable that many visitors will in fact change from the preselected value right away, thus
eliminating and never noticing the problem, but assuming that is the case would totally
ignore the visitors that do encounter this barrier.
Despite adequately communicating user errors, the form does not communicate correct
completion of the fields to the visitor. Arvola (2014, p. 120) explains that a form should
actively signal to the user when the form is correctly filled out.
When comparing to Shneiderman and Plaisant’s (2005, p. 297) list for user-friendly and
converting forms, the form in the old design ticks many boxes as has been partly
explained. From a design perspective it has a visually appealing layout and clear
boundaries between input fields, and with regards to the content, it incorporates a friendly,
polite and customer-centric voice, comprehensible instructions, descriptive input field
labels and consistent terminology. The content surrounding the form itself could be
improved. For example, both ‘Contact Us’ in the title and ‘Send’ in the CTA button are
very generic in their wording and does not provide any benefit statement or incentive (see
108

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

figure 22 or appendix F: 15, 16). ‘Contact Us’ for example, does probably not correlate
with what Shneiderman and Plaisant’s (2005, p. 297) defines as a meaningful title. The
word send, however, is an action-oriented verb as recommended by Frick and EylerWerve (2015, p. 120), but it does not include what benefit the visitor will gain by
performing the action. That lack of communication regarding received value and benefit
for the visitor is also apparent throughout the form and not only in the CTA button.
Additionally, the explanatory content above and below the form could be simplified and
shortened to provide more value as well as more focus on the form itself. The ‘About’
link (see appendix F: 24) for example directs visitors away from the form, rather than
focusing their attention on converting. The content is also missing incentives such as
social proof or performance or security indicators that would help validate the benefit and
value provided through converting.
According to Rabhan (2013, p. 40-51) and Ash (2008, p. 100) among others, a lead
generation form should also try to ask for as little information as possible. The form in
the old design consists of 9 input fields, which according to Rabhan’s (2013, p. 40)
classifies as a long capture form. Long capture forms have been shown to decrease
conversions, but there is a fine line between asking too much and too little. Asking less
will logically increase conversions because it requires less from visitors, but the quality
of those leads might degrade as the conversion rate increases due to this same reason; it
requires less effort and it fails to qualify leads thoroughly. It is still worth noting that the
old form is rather long and has a couple of input fields that are not necessarily needed.
For example, additional information regarding the visitor such as multiple forms of
contact such as email and phone number, or website address could be followed-up by the
sales team after the lead has come in.
An additional interactivity issue with the old form is that when the form is open on top of
the underlying webpage, the scroll function in the browser stays active, meaning that the
visitors are able the scroll the underlying page even though the form is open. This creates
an illusion of being able to scroll the form, when in fact, it is the page below that scrolls
and the form stays static. This results in a confusing user experience for a couple of
reasons; 1) the visitor is under the impression that the form should scroll and that the form
page is longer than what is visible in the viewport, 2) if the visitor has scrolled the
underlying page while on the form, the page will not be in the same position when the
visitor navigates away from the form as it was when he or she navigated to the form in
109

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the first place which disrupts flow and generates a feeling of being lost as the visitor does
not necessarily recognize the visible content.
6.1.4 Credibility
The overall design and the copy portray a credible image of the case-company. Most
noteworthy is the ‘Why Smartroom’ section in the middle of the page (see appendix F:
10), that convinces the visitor of the company’s expertise, customer support and value
proposition. The most noteworthy credibility signal when disregarding the written copy
are the client logos at the bottom of the page, they are strong signals that support
conversions. Showcasing existing clients is one of the best types of social proof since it
shows visitors that others have used the service and the clients’ brand equity rubs off on
the case-company. In accordance with the statements made by Frick and Eyler-Werve
(2015, p. 147) and Chaffey and Smith (2013, p. 320), the contact information and the
privacy policy are located in the footer (see figure 25). The footer also includes a thirdparty validation signal that improves credibility; the ‘Code from Finland’ logo (see figure
25 or appendix F: 19) and it features the case-company logo.
Figure 25: Footer of the old design.

The company logo is also constantly visible in the viewport due to its placement in the
navigation menu, as explained in section 6.1.3. While improving usability, this also
improves credibility as visitors are assured that they remain on the same website. The link
to the ‘About’ page in the navigation menu (see appendix F: 22) is a good element that
creates trust and credibility as this page contains images and names of all employees,
showing the actual people working in the company which personalizes the company
brand and makes it more relatable for visitors.
Visitors are also presented with a link to the privacy policy when they first land the page
through a cookie consent pop-up, which is displayed at the bottom edge of the viewport,
see figure 26. Today, this is expected by visitors and might feel trivial, but in fact, a
110

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

webpage that does not inform visitors of the use of cookies and how it handles visitors’
personal information can feel unsafe and lead to distrust. Customers have raised
expectations in the online world and websites must deliver clear service promises through
privacy statements, guarantees on security and customer service response times (Chaffey
and Smith 2013, p. 174).
Figure 26: Cookie consent pop up displayed when visitors first land on a page.

There are many positives regarding credibility, but there is still much potential for
improvement. All credibility signals are at the bottom of the page and no testimonials or
performance indicators are used, both of which would have a great impact on credibility.
The client logos are very good and are cleverly placed in context with the CTA, but alone
they are not enough to convince every visitor as there is no indication that these clients
have been pleased with the service offering, they are not equally convincing as a
testimonial or an endorsement for example. As mentioned in the previous section, signals
of credibility should also be used in the lead generation form as suggested by Hunt (2011,
p. 174), because security is a critical determinant for visitors when giving up personal
information. The form in the old design does not include any credibility signals (see
appendix F).

6.2 Evaluation of the new design
As the previous section (6.1) presented the evaluation results of the old design, this
section will present the results of the new design as per the coding schedule of the new
design (see appendix J). However, this section will focus more on highlighting the
changes between the old design and the new, rather than repeating an identical evaluation
as the previous evaluation of the old design. This makes sense because the new design is
based upon the hypothesized model created in this study and has been developed with the
old design as a starting point, theoretically the new design should be an improvement
from the old. Focusing on the differences also helps in avoiding repetition of elements
that have already been discussed in detail in section 6.1. For example, the brand color
scheme has not changed in the new design so there is no need to examine this in detail as
in section 6.1.1, figure 18. A complete screenshot of the new design can be seen in
appendix G.

6.2.1 Aesthetics
From an aesthetical point of view, the new design has maintained the same visually
pleasing style and simplistic design as the old design. However, there has still been some
significant changes, especially in the use of imagery and the use of colors. The new design
creates a good first impression due to aesthetical elements, but also due to changes in
three other conversion dimensions as will become apparent in the following sections.
Imagery
The greatest change in aesthetic appeal between the old and the new design is the use of
imagery. The new design incorporates a large image in the first screenful that supports
the value proposition of the page by portraying a happy couple using the hotel TV as can
be seen in figure 27.
Figure 27: First screenful of the new design at 1920 x 1080 screen resolution.

The image also utilizes directional ques by having the models focus their attention
through both gestures and vision towards the main CTA area. The CTA area includes a
benefit statement and benefit list along with the CTA button itself. Using images with
models to drive attention is the most powerful type of directional que because images
with peoples’ faces subconsciously draw visitors’ attention whereafter people
automatically look towards what the people in the image are looking at (Blanks & Jesson
2018, p. 142).
112

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

The whole first half of the page in the new design is vastly different from the old, which
means there has been changes in visual hierarchy and use of colors. Regarding hierarchy,
the product images are roughly the same size as before, but with the added content for
every product description (see figure 28 or appendix G: 11) every product area has a
greater role on the page than in the old design.
Figure 28: The product area for ‘Smartroom TV’, the first product under the ‘Hibox
Smartroom for your guests’ section of the new design.

The structure of the different product segments (‘Guests’ and ‘Staff’) are more clearly
separated by the use of background color. The guest-specific products have a white
(#FFFFFF) background, while the staff-specific products have a light-grey (#EBEDEF)
background (see appendix G: 19, 7). Furthermore, the potentially attention averting
background image that scrolled throughout the page has been removed in the new design.
Colors and contrasts
The colors used on the page are the same brand colors as in the old design, however the
placement and prioritization of those colors have changed slightly. The light blue
(#29C1E6) has now been reserved for CTA buttons or for highlighting certain elements.
For example, the product links, product feature lists and the testimonials are highlighted
with this color (see appendix G: 1, 3, 5) which guides focus towards these elements, while
other elements that used to be in the light blue in the old design have now been changed
to darker colors so they do not interfere with the visitors focus on the high-value elements.
Some other elements in the design are highlighted as well, such as the product links, but
these were already highlighted in the old design. In the new design the light blue is not
being used for anything else than highlighting, so the color is used more sparingly than
in the old design, but its new purpose helps high-value elements stand out and draw the
visitors’ attention.
113

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Color and contrast have also seen development in the form of transparency and gradients.
The background image in the first screenful is covered with a gradient combination of
white (#FFFFFF) and black (#000000), allowing the image itself to show through while
the text on top of the image remains clearly readable and distinguishable from the
background. The transparency of the black row with the various credibility signals also
helps the signals stand out.
Typography
The typefaces used in the new design remain the same as the old; Montserrat and Roboto.
Some minor changes in font-size have occurred that creates a good balance between
headings and copy which improves the readability as well as how visitors interpret the
structural layout of the page. The testimonials further down the page are in italics which
highlights them more clearly as quotes.
6.2.2 Content
A significant issue with the old design was the lack of content in the first screenful and
entire first half of the page. In the new design these areas also the areas that have received
the most attention and improvements, and an increase in written content is the most
noticeable change between the two designs.
Visitor needs, content placement and first impression
A major improvement in the new design is the added content in the first screenful. From
having very little content, the first screenful now has a more detailed heading with
explanatory sub-heading that works as a benefit statement, a benefit list and a CTA
button. This is an almost exact interpretation of Gardner’s (2018) mini landing page
model with the only completely missing element being an urgency or special offer
statement. Additionally, the sub-heading and benefit statement should, according to
Gardner’s model, be two separate elements. If the model were to be utilized fully, an
additional benefit statement should be added in combination with the benefit list while
the sub-heading would be an independent element.
The elements mentioned above give visitors a sense of the page and its value proposition
immediately when they enter the page. The new CTA button also draws attention right
away. Together these elements create a clear path of conversion as visitors can easily
114

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

grasp what the page is telling them to do. The business and visitor goals are now better
facilitated with this added content. It is clearly geared towards the business goal while
simultaneously facilitating the visitor goal, not only through content, but through
conversion determinants such as imagery, relating to the aesthetics dimension.
When looking beyond the business and visitor goals, the first screenful and resulting first
impression have been improved in other ways as well. The menu item highlighter in the
navigation menu is one example of an improvement. It instantly communicates where on
the website the visitor is located when they enter. New credibility signals have also been
added that assures visitors of the case-company’s credibility and value proposition
immediately, and the overall design is professional, simplistic and visually pleasing.
Therefore, conversion determinants from all four conversion dimensions can be identified
in the first screenful.
After the first screenful, the product area has seen the greatest increase in content in the
new design. Each individual product listing utilizes the same layout structure as in the
first screenful: a heading, benefit statement and benefit list. The first screenful uses this
model to point out the most important parts of the value proposition for the product
offering as a whole, while the product presentations do the same thing but for each
individual product that is categorized under the complete product family.
As in the old design the AIDA model can be identified from the new design as it begins
by creating awareness through benefits in the first screenful, interest through the more
detailed descriptions in the product area, desire through the unique selling points of the
product offering and finally ending in action with the CTA area at the bottom of the page
(see appendix G: 14, 3, 19, 7, 20, 17). Compared to the old design, the awareness and
interest stages have improved thanks to the added content in the areas relevant for these
stages, i.e. the upper parts of the page and especially the first screenful. The first half of
the page as a whole now offers more incentive and value for the visitor. It provides more
information, thus allowing the visitors to grasp the value proposition quicker and to
understand if the service offering is what they are looking for. In short, the whole page
can be said to better facilitate the visitor needs and goals, as well as the business goal
better than the old design. Beginning from the first screenful, every screenful aims to aid
the visitor in finding the information they are looking for while providing incentives to
convert.

115

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Copywriting
Most of the new content is rather still rather we based. The longer benefits statements (see
appendix G: 14, 37) incorporate you and tries to communicate with the visitors as if
talking to them, but there is still something missing. The overall feeling of the page just
presenting and selling a product that was so prominent in the old design, has not been
diminished with the new design. The benefit and feature lists make it easier for visitors
to digest the content and listing the core features for every product can be of value to the
visitors, however the tone is very company-centric here as well due to the fact that it
focuses on the products themselves. The features are, as the word suggests, features of
the product and not benefits that are relevant for the visitor. The copy should list benefits
and not features (Rabhan 2013, p. 117).
Call to action
The call to actions have been improved in the new design. There are now three call to
action buttons in total (see appendix G: 2, 4, 6), in contrast to the old design’s two. The
new and third button is the one in the first screenful. As there should always be a call to
action in the first screenful this is a major improvement. The supporting content above
and around the CTA button, made up of the mini landing page model (Gardner 2018)
constitutes a complete CTA area, meaning that there are multiple elements that visually
and contextually guide visitors towards performing the business action on the page. The
CTA area in the first screenful utilizes the main features of persuasive copy through
descriptive headings, benefit statements and lists, structured through relevant placement
of these elements.
The only call to action that was visible in the first screenful of the old design was the
‘Contact us’ item in the navigation menu. This CTA is still present in the new design, so
the first screenful now has two CTA buttons. The CTA in the menu has been updated to
take the shape of a light blue (#29C1E6) button such as the other CTAs on the page. This
makes it stand out in the menu and as the menu is constantly visible since it is a static
element, visitors always know how to convert. Even though the menu CTA has been
improved it still uses the generic copy, but the other CTA buttons on the page have been
updated to use more action- and benefit-oriented copy; ‘Request a free demo’.
The bottom CTA has also been altered slightly; it now has a heading of sorts above it;
‘The digital hotel experience redefined’ (see appendix G: 25) which works as a persuasive
116

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

phrase to entice visitors to convert. The heading above the client reference logos have
also been changed to a more customer-centric style of copy from the old company-centric
version. Together, the heading, logos and button work as a CTA area, but it applies
different persuasion techniques than the CTA area in the first screenful. Both CTA areas
use persuasive copy, action- and benefit-oriented verbs and placement in relevant context,
the main difference between the two is that the bottom one uses client logos as social
proof while the top one focuses on benefits. Using multiple persuasion techniques on a
page is encouraged and especially in proximity to CTA buttons to make up a complete
CTA area.
6.2.3 Usability
From a usability perspective the user experience has improved in a number of ways in the
new design. The main changes have occurred in the layout, which affects the on-page
navigation and state of flow that the page generates for visitors but there have also been
changes across the entire usability spectrum.
Navigation
One of the first things the visitor notices when entering the page is the navigation menu.
In the new design the menu structure remains unchanged. There are still 8 items and the
clickable logo in the menu, which is a substantial number, although the ‘Contact us’
button has been separated from the rest of the items, making the menu less bland. The
menu is also static in relation to the page, meaning that as the visitor scrolls the menu
remains visible at the top. The greatest improvement in the menu is the highlighter under
the active menu item, indicating to visitors where on the website they are located. The
menu item highlighter is portrayed as a gray underline (see appendix G: 16). A system
designed for any type of human to computer interaction should communicate the status
of the system and the highlight is a way of doing that.
The menu item highlighter is relevant, both from a site-wide navigational standpoint, and
an on-page navigational standpoint. It helps visitors navigate between pages while it also
helps visitors navigate a specific page due to the constant status communication. With
regard to on-page navigation, the page has also become significantly longer due to the
increase in content in the first half of the page. From a content perspective this is a good
thing, but from a usability perspective it can have negative implications. A longer page
117

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

means that the visitors must scroll more to see both the guest- and the staff-specific
sections (see appendix G: 7, 19), as well as the entire page for that matter. The worst-case
scenario is that this would disrupt the state of flow on the page. However, the added
content has a logical and hierarchical structure and is relevant in the context of the
products presented, so it could actually be argued that the added content benefits flow in
comparison to the old design. When visitors navigate the page, the added content helps
guide them along, giving them a clearer perception of the page and its value in relevance
to their own needs. The old design with its very limited content, however, did not provide
as much information, thus forcing visitors to make an effort to understand what the page
is about as opposed to the page just communicating that clearly.
Layout and simplicity
Another risk of making the page longer is that website visitors do not engage in scrolling
and if they do not find something relevant to them directly upon entering the page, they
will most likely bounce (Fessenden 2018). Furthermore, it could be argued that the old
design allowed visitors to more quickly grasp the entirety of the product offering due to
its short and compact nature. However, the structure of the added content provides a
logical path for the eye to follow and has not impaired the layout or navigation on the
page. Designing for lack of scrolling is especially important in the first screenful and the
new design facilitates that as it clearly reveals that there is more information further down
the page by showing the top of the product area, see figure 27 in section 6.2.1. The rest
of the page layout is also structured so that visitors are encouraged to scroll as much as
possible by having the layout designed so that every content section reveals that there is
more content underneath. The layout also facilitates the AIDA model through the content
structure as mentioned in the previous section. One visual design aspect in the layout that
can have a negative effect on scrollability however is the use of straight shapes and tiles
with different background colors to separate content sections from each other. They work
well for this purpose but as a visitor navigates the page these shapes create visual brakes
in the content rather than illustrating a clear path for a state of flow. Having most content
on the same background color or not making the background tiles extend all the way to
the ages of the viewport (see appendix G: 7, 20, 17, 7) or using diagonal lines instead of
horizontal lines are all good ways of making the content more “airy”, making it seem to
continue further down the page and to not seem so segmented visually.

118

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Despite the great changes in design, the new design has managed to maintain the elegance
and the simplicity of the old design. The greatest change in layout has occurred in the first
half of the page, while the second half has remained almost identical to the old design
with the exception of some changes in color and headings. The first screenful has taken
the Gutenberg Rule (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p. 83-84) into account by placing the
heading at the top left instead of in e.g. the center of the viewport. As the visitors’ vision
flows towards the bottom right in accordance with the Gutenberg, the visual cues in the
background image and the pointing remote as described in section 6.2.1 (see figure 27
and appendix G: 10) guides focus back to the benefit list and CTA button. In combination,
these elements maximize the possibility of a visitor allocating their attention towards the
CTA area, and thus makes sure that visitors’ do not miss the most important information
of the first screenful. The mini landing page model (Gardner 2018) used, as described in
the previous section has also improved the layout of the first screenful.
The attention ratio of the new design is 40:4 compared to the old design’s 39:3. The
attention ratio of the new design is slightly better than that of the old design
mathematically, but the placement of the CTAs is also remarkably important and the
added CTA button that makes up the increase in attention ratio is in the first screenful. As
this is the most important place to have a CTA the new attention ratio cannot only be
judged by mathematics. Due to the placement of the new CTA, the attention ratio of the
old design is disproportionately better than that of the old.
Interactivity
Interactive elements on the page help in keeping the visitors engaged and incentivizes
action on the page as they feel more in control of their own experience (Chaffey & Smith
2013; Laurel 1991; Steuer 1992). The new design has the same interactive horizontal
scrolling menu (see appendix G: 17) as in the old design, but the new CTA button design
and navigation menu creates more interactivity. The CTA buttons’ rounded corners
distinguish them more clearly as buttons that invite to click. They also have a nice hover
effect that reinforces their clickability in the eyes of the visitor. The menu item highlighter
that was mentioned previously is also an interactive element as the highlighter changes
color when hovered on. The underline that makes up the highlighter also has an animation
that makes it expand from the middle when hovering on the menu items that aren’t active

119

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

currently, improving the overall navigation on the whole website and not just the subject
page.
The interactive elements have as such improved form the old design, but with regards to
interactivity in general, the number of interactive elements on the page is still relatively
low. However, since interactions are described as the number of actions visitors can take
on any given page, having a low number of possible interactions is not necessarily a bad
thing. Conversion design wants to make visitors focus on actions that matter, in other
words business-driven actions as exemplified through the attention ratio. So, a low
number of actions is good as long as some (or most) of those actions are business driven,
which is the case in the new design of the subject page.
The lead generation form
The only conversion point on the page is the lead generation form, and as such it is also
the main business-driven action and combined with all of the preceding CTA buttons, the
greatest interactive element visitors can engage with. As in the old design, the form is still
rendered as a pop-up over the page as a visitor clicks a CTA and it utilizes the brand color
scheme in the same way as previously. From a functional perspective the new form is
exactly the same, i.e. it is a single-page form with same number of input fields that the
visitor must complete to convert. The changes that have occurred, can mainly be found
in the written content of the form combined with some minor visual design changes.
Figure 29: The lead generation form of the new design.

120

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

The heading, sub-heading and CTA button now describe the value proposition, the benefit
that a visitor will receive from submitting the form and what the action will result in (a
request for a free demo). Compared to the very generic ‘Contact us’ and ‘SEND’ in the
old design, this is a significant improvement. The explanatory content with the link to the
About page has been moved under the form and CTA button to not draw as much
attention. Guiding visitors that might not be looking to submit the form, but rather just to
contact an employee is good in terms of user experience but is not of so high priority that
it should be placed in the most prominent area of the form. The descriptive labels have
also gone through some minor changes to have a slightly more polite and customer-centric
tone.
The preselection issue in the old design (see section 6.1.3) has been fixed. The
preselection now automatically triggers the secondary dropdown, so it is visible when the
visitor navigates to the form, thus removing the problem. However, the scroll function of
the underlying page is still present and as in the old design, can lead to a confusing user
experience when navigating away from the form.
The form is still rather long as it includes all the same fields as in the old design. There
are 9 input fields, and counting the button press that visitors must perform to actually send
it in, there are 10 manual actions to perform. From a visitor perspective that can be quite
a lot of work to simply establish contact, work that can result in many visitors abandoning
the form, hence the reason why it is recommended to keep a form a short as possible.
Additionally, now new credibility incentives in the form of social proof, performance
indicators or security indicators have been added to the form.
6.2.4 Credibility
The old design managed to portray a professional and credible image through its design,
but it had a fairly low number of credibility signals on the page. The new design has
maintained the credibility elements from the old design, such as the constantly visible
logo, footer elements, about link in the navigation menu, privacy policy pop-up, client
logos and professional copy, while also adding new elements that paint a credible picture
of the case-company.

121

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Overall sense of credibility
The new design inspires more credibility than the old design. There are a couple of
reasons for this, but from a perspective of the overall feeling a visitor can experience
when viewing page, is that the case-company is one of professionalism, knowledge and
seriousness. Credibility is a mix of trust and expertise (Fogg & Tseng 1999) and the added
content especially portrays expertise, whereas the old design generated a feeling of the
opposite with its lack of content. The added content helps visitors identify themselves and
solutions to their needs, which reassures them they are moving in the right direction.
The visual design is also aesthetically pleasing, which is an important part of a webpage’s
overall credibility as visitors have a tendency to trust pages that they deem appealing
more than pages they deem less appealing. The improved layout and structure also affect
the perceived credibility (Fogg et al. 2003).
The design does also not include any technical errors such as the dropdown issue in the
old lead generation form, nor does it have any incomplete elements, interfering graphics
or inconsistent styling that could have a negative effect on visitors purchase intentions
(Everard & Galletta 2003). The page being functional is a prerequisite for generating
credibility and trust, so not having any glitches is very important.
Performance and security indicators
The old design had either a low or non-existent number of security and performance
indicators, which have been partly attended to in the new design. The first screenful
incorporates performance indicators, which immediately communicates the credibility of
the case-company to the visitor and that the service offering is of a high and reliable
standard. In practice the indicators are visualized in a black transparent banner under the
main content in the first screenful, see appendix G: 21 or figure 27 in section 6.2.1. The
banner includes numerical statistics on the case-company’s performance. Numbers and
statistics have a greater impact on credibility than mere statements explaining the same
thing, and they support the value proposition by describing number of served customers
and depicting the global status of the case-company. Through this they fortify the level
of product and service quality. However, no new security indicators have been added, but
the existing security indicators from the old design remain. The number of security
indicators is as such relatively low.

122

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Social proof
The new design incorporates the same social proof as the old design, i.e. the client logos
in the bottom CTA area. However, other elements that inspire authentic believability have
also been added to the page. In the same black transparent banner with the performance
indicators in the first screenful, there are two awards and two third-party logos that work
as social proof (see appendix G: 30, 31). Both the awards and the logos work as thirdparty validations that utilizes the brand credibility of others to assure visitors that people
are willing to vouch for the case-company. In other words, they convince visitors that
others have deemed the case-company as trustworthy and that their service offering
adheres to a high standard.
Under the product area, roughly in the middle of the page, the new design also has two
testimonials (see appendix G: 1). The client testimonials are quotes from the casecompany’s customers that visitors can easily relate to because the quotes are from
customers that most likely are in the same customer segment as the visitors. The
testimonials generate authentic believability because people are persuaded by other
people that they deem to be their peers. All credibility signals on the page, and most
prominently the testimonials, show visitors that the case-company has a strong reputation
within the industry, which is very important to B2B buyers (Leake et al. 2012, p. 30-31).
It is important to remember, that visitors are inherently skeptical on the web (Chaffey &
Smith 2013, p. 161). So even if these credibility signals would not manage to convince
visitors to convert, they reassure them that they are dealing with a real, credible company
that others have interacted with before them. Trust is a prerequisite for conversions as
argued by Harris and Goode (2010) among others, and indicators such as these are
prerequisites for communicating that essential sense of credibility that in turn evokes trust
in the company and brand.

6.3 Differences between the designs
The previous section focused on depicting the main changes and improvements in the
new design compared to the old. This section will summarize those changes in a more
concrete presentation through table 5. Identified conversion determinants that have
remained unchanged from the old design are similarly summarized in table 6. In other
words, table 6 depicts the positives and negatives regarding conversion design that were
123

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

already present in the old design and that have not been addressed in the new. By showing
both the changes between the designs and the unchanged conversion determinants, this
section provides a clear description of the current state of conversion design on the subject
page, and as such presents the results of the redesign as a whole. Both tables are
categorized according to the conversion dimensions that were defined in the hypothesized
model in chapter 5, and that has worked as the basis for the entire analysis throughout
chapter 6. The +/- column indicates whether the conversion determinant is of a positive
or negative nature within the context of conversion design.

As can be seen from table 5 a lot of improvements have been made to all of the conversion
dimensions. The only negative change is that the added content in the content dimension
has resulted in a longer page, which can have a negative effect with regard to the usability
dimension. Web visitors have been proven to not engage in scrolling (Fessenden 2018),
which means that a longer page can result in fewer visitors finding the content further
down the page. However, if the content manages to keep visitors engaged by facilitating
all of the conversion dimensions, this development is not that significant in its negative
nature. The improvements made across the board do definitely facilitate visitor
engagement better than the old design.
With regard to the page layout, the improvements have mainly taken place in the first half
of the page, specifically int the first screenful and in the following product presentation
area that together constitute the first half. The fact that the first half of the page has seen
the most significant changes was to be expected since that area was the most lacking in
the old design.
Aesthetical improvements, added content, usability elements and credibility signals are
all factored into the first screenful, resulting in an improved first impression. The
significance these improvements have on the overall conversion design is worth
emphasizing. The first impression visitors have when they arrive on a page is what
determines whether they will engage with the page or bounce, a positive first impression
may also result in the halo effect, increasing the holistic perception of quality among the
visitors (Lindgaard et al. 2006). The above the fold content is what determines their first
impression, therefore, the first screenful of any given webpage is the most important area
from a conversion design perspective (Ryan 2014, p. 61; Goward 2013, p. 162).
Conclusively, the first screenful and first impression have been affected by all conversion
dimensions. This is of course true for almost all areas of the page as the conversion
dimensions and their determinants work in unison to achieve an optimal level of perceived
service quality. It would be rather limiting to analyze conversion design based on different
areas in the page layout exclusively. However, the importance of the area above the fold
for the first impression, and the fact that the most important information for the visitor
should be communicated quickly (read: top of the page) to keep the visitor engaged, as
well as models such as the AIDA (Ash et al. 2012, p. 39) and the inverted pyramid

125

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

technique (Leake et al. 2012, p. 156) suggest that placement of copy and certain elements
in the layout is crucial in conversion design.
This is why this analysis has chosen the hypothesized model and the conversion
dimensions as a basis, while additionally indicating where on the page the changes have
taken place as illustrated in both table 5 and 6.
When looking at the specific conversion dimensions many of the presented conversion
determinants in the hypothesized model have been addressed. The aesthetics dimension
has improved in its use of multiple conversion determinants. Specifically, the use of color,
imagery and directional ques facilitates a converting page by focusing attention towards
conversion elements such as CTA buttons and areas, as well as other high value elements.
The added content in the first half of the page, added CTA areas with multiple persuasion
techniques including buttons and benefit statements and lists, as well as social proof,
improved AIDA model that facilitates visitor needs and the use of the mini landing page
model has constituted major improvements in the content dimension.
With regard to the usability dimension, improvements in layout, attention ratio, lead
generation form and navigation have been identified and can be said to improve the state
of flow that visitors experience when interacting with the site.
The credibility dimension in turn, has seen changes with regard to social proof,
performance indicators and security indicators. The added content from the content
dimension has also played a role in portraying a more credible picture of the casecompany as it adds expertise, professionalism and reliability.
The new design did not address all of the conversion determinants in the old design, nor
did it have to, most unaddressed conversion determinants already had a positive effect on
conversions. Table 6 depicts the conversion determinants that have remained unchanged
from the old design to the new.
There are however unchanged negative determinants in all of the conversion dimensions
except for one as table 6 shows. This indicates that there is still room for improvement in
the conversion design of the subject page. However, such is the experimentative nature
of conversion design. It is a continuous process of experimentation and it is good practice
to focus on smaller incremental changes (Blanks & Jesson 2018, p. 67), which means
marketers should not try to improve everything at once. In this regard, the study
126

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

performed in this thesis is unorthodox as it focused on a complete webpage redesign.
However, this depends on the circumstances surrounding the experiment and what the
actual goal is. In this thesis for example it was suitable to perform a quite extensive
redesign to facilitate the aim of the study.

6.4 Effect on the conversion rate
The new design has clearly made multiple changes and improvements on the subject page.
However, the changes have so far only been analyzed subjectively according to the
hypothesized model. To analyze if the changes have had any tangible impact in terms of
online lead generation for the case-company the changes need to be analyzed through a
127

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

relevant metric. In this case, that metric is the conversion rate. The conversion rate
consists of the percentage relation between the number of website visitors and leads
generated, i.e. the number of leads divided by the number of visitors. It indicates what
portion of the visitors actually convert into leads.
To analyze the change in conversion rate, quantitative secondary data consisting of the
precalculated conversion rate of the subject page was gathered during the time period
01.01.2018 - 31.12.2019. The new design was published on the 25th February 2019,
meaning that the new design was live for the majority of 2019, making it optimal to
compare monthly conversion rates year on year to analyze the effect on the conversion
rate between the old and the new design. Consequently, the conversion rate percentages
of the subject page presented in table 7 have been divided into two columns; 2018 and
2019, wherein the data collected during 2018 represents the old design, and the data
collected during 2019 represents the new. Furthermore, it is relevant to use datasets of
relatively long time periods to maximize the amount of collected data and thus increase
the reliability of the results.
All data in table 7 have been collected from Google Analytics and only includes desktop
traffic to the subject page www.hibox.tv/Hotel-TV-Platform.shtml as per the
methodology and limitations of the study.

All months of 2019 have seen an increase of conversion rate except for June and July.
The average monthly increase between 2018 and 2019, June and July included, is 53.10
%. When looking at the yearly average conversion rates, 2019 has seen an increase of
32.73 %, meaning that during 2019 the subject page converted 32 % more leads than in
2018.
June and July of 2018 had exceptionally high numbers compared to the historical average
of these months, 2.28 % and 2.39 % respectively on average for the previous three years,
2015-2017 (available data for the website dates back to January 2015). It can be argued
that since the summer period of the year is historically a calmer period with regard to
traffic and thus conversion rates, the summer months of 2018 were an anomaly, and as
such does not devalue the overall increasing trend of conversion rate during 2019.
Historically, the average conversion rates for June and July during the lead generation
forms entire lifespan (2015-2019) are 2.56 % and 2.74 % (see appendix L for all-time
monthly conversion rates and monthly averages), further supporting the argument that the
negative drop in conversions in the summer months of 2019 are not a result of issues with
the new design, rather the data is affected by the unproportionally high conversion rates
of June and July 2018.
The subject page was already experiencing a positive trend during January and February
of 2019 before the new design was implemented, which could suggest that the changes
in design were not the only aspects contributing to the increase in conversions. Other
factors beyond the scope of the study in this thesis might have benefited the number of
leads as well, such factors could be increase in traffic due to other marketing activities,
which is highly plausible since the case-company’s marketing activities were not put on
hold for the duration of this experiment. However, it should be noted that no marketing
activity or campaign was performed with a direct intention to influence the subject page
during this time.
There are seemingly sizable fluctuations in monthly change in conversion rates
throughout 2019. However, these year on year fluctuations are not in any way exceptional
as also this is subject to external factors that dictate the amount and intent of visitor traffic
coming into the website in the first place. Seasonal changes, visitor intent, visitor stage
in the buyer’s journey and differences in traffic sources (organic search, referral, direct

129

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

etc.) all might have an effect on the number of conversions over time. The main interest
is whether or not there is an upward trend in conversions, which there is.
Based on the results presented in table 7, it is reasonable to conclude that the changes in
design summarized in section 6.3 have had a positive effect on the conversion rate of the
subject page. Which indicates that the conversion dimensions including determinants
identified as core elements of conversion design in the hypothesized model are sound.

6.5 Chapter summary
This chapter has presented the results of the conversion design evaluations of both the old
and the new design. The results were based on the coding schedules for respective design
as presented in appendix I and J respectively. Section 6.3 summarized the main
differences between the designs to contrast the in-depth results depicted in sections 6.1
and 6.2. Section 6.4 presented what effect the changes in design has had on the conversion
rate of the subject page, concluding that the new design has contributed to an overall
increase in the conversion rate of the subject page. The hypothesized model created in
chapter 4 and 5 can therefore be deemed a success. As such, the results of the study
support mainly three conclusions; (1) the conversion rate of the case-company’s subject
page has been improved through design, meaning that (2) the hypothesized model
developed in chapter five and presented in section 5.2 works and due to this, (3) the casecompany should consider implementing conversion design as a major practice of their
online lead generation processes. These conclusions are what the following and final
chapter is centered around.

7 CONCLUSION
This concluding chapter will discuss the observations made throughout the research. It
will answer the research questions, discuss the hypothesized model created in chapters 4
and 5, give recommendations to the case-company and discuss implications of the results.
Furthermore, it will present suggestions for future research within the fields of
conversion design and lead generation.

7.1 Answering the research questions
This case study thesis set out to research one main object; the role of design on the
corporate website, as it refers to the generation of sales leads. The research aim was
facilitated by using the case-company’s corporate website as a subject of study. Through
the website, the researcher could test whether the conversion rate could be affected
through design. Two research questions where established; (1) How can the conversion
rate of a corporate website be increased through design?, and (2) how has the new design
of the case-company’s subject page affected the conversion rate? The following sections
will answer the research questions based on the findings throughout this thesis.
7.1.1 How can the conversion rate of a corporate website be increased
through design?
Design has a major role in increasing conversions on corporate websites. There are
multiple frameworks from multiple fields of marketing and business that touch on the
subject of conversions. Out of these, user centered design, conversion rate optimization,
landing page optimization and e-servicescapes & service quality have been judged as the
most important methodologies to consider when designing for conversion. Conversion
design, as this author has chosen to call the combination of all these methodologies,
considers four main categories as the most important to increase the conversion rate.
These conversion dimensions are aesthetics, content, usability and credibility (see chapter
5). They derive from creating an optimal experience for the website visitor. Each
dimension has a set of conversion determinants that describe certain tangible elements on
a website or page that can and should be optimized for stimulating conversions.

131

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

Within the aesthetic dimension marketers should focus on applying typographical
structures and type-face choices that improve readability and scannability of the webpage
content, use imagery that supports the value proposition and that directs attention to
desired areas of the page. The use of colors and contrast also play a key role in generating
an aesthetically pleasing design and focusing visitor attention. Creating content that
consists of customer-centric copy, facilitates the visitors’ needs and provides clear actions
for the visitors to perform constitutes the content dimension. Creating a state of flow
through logical and conventional navigation methods, well-structured layouts, simplistic
designs and interactive elements that engage the visitors constitute the usability
dimension. In turn, the credibility dimension seeks to evoke credibility and trust towards
the company by applying certain visual credibility signals such as testimonials, reviews,
performance numbers or security symbols.
Many determinants in conversion design are based on persuasion techniques such as
third-party validation, visual ques and elements that drive attention, but conversion design
is as much related to meeting visitors’ needs and providing an excellent user experience
in terms of usability and interactivity, as well as making it possible for visitors to achieve
their goals as efficiently as possible. The dimensions and their determinants derive from
generating visual appeal, visitor satisfaction, ease of use and trust among visitors, with
the end goal of improving the visitors’ perceived service quality (see section 5.5, figure
17). Conversion design is therefore very concerned with the website visitor, making it a
customer-centric practice. If the visitors perceive the quality of the presented service to
be of adequate standard and there are no visual elements or usability issues hindering
them, then the chance of conversion is very high.
The individual determinants within the four dimensions do not all have to be perfected to
influence the conversion rate. Individual improvements to any of the dimensions can also
have a positive effect. Which dimensions have the greatest impact is highly dependent on
market and target audience, as visitor behavior and needs vary across cultures and
business landscapes. With that said, the dimensions also work in unison to create a
holistically better user experience that improves the perceived quality of the website and
consequently of the product and company, meaning that marketers should strive to attend
to all conversion determinants while keeping the holistic experience in mind. To
incrementally improve the conversion rate of a corporate website, marketers should run
continuous data-driven testing on their pages. This involves applying small changes to a
132

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

relevant conversion determinant and analyzing how it changes visitor behavior and
engagement on the page. Examples of changes could be changing a heading, replacing an
existing color or adding a new piece of content.
7.1.2 How has the new design of the case-company’s subject page
affected the conversion rate?
The answer to this research question was effectively answered in section 6.4 so it would
be redundant to go through the intricacies of the effect on the conversion rate again. To
summarize the results, the new design, developed with the hypothesized model and its
conversion dimensions as a guiding framework, did have a positive effect on the
conversion rate of the page. The new design was tested throughout the year of 2019 and
compared against data from the previous year, during which the old design of the page
was active. The old design had not been developed with a conversion design framework.
The data from 2019 indicated an average increase in conversion rate of 32.73 % and only
two months of the year showed a decreased conversion rate compared to 2018. The
average monthly increase in conversion rate was 53.10 %.
The positive effect on the conversion rate indicates that the hypothesized model can
successfully be used as a model for increasing the conversion rate of corporate websites
and that the conversion dimensions it depicts are relevant components within conversion
design. It can also be concluded that the case-company’s website can indeed be optimized
towards a higher conversion rate through design, and that conversion design is a tactic
worth pursuing further as part of the company’s online lead generation.

7.2 Recommendations to the case-company
The aim of this research was two-fold; “research the role of design on the corporate
website as it refers to the generation of sales leads. Upon completion of the study the
case-company will be able to draw conclusions regarding whether or not the design of
their website should be pursued as a type of lead generation tactic.” Based on the
discussion in the previous section and in chapter 6 regarding the former part, the following
can be concluded regarding the latter; yes, conversion design is a lead generation tactic
worthy of further investigation and consideration by the case-company. The findings of
this case study both in theoretical terms, i.e. the definition of conversion design combined
133

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

with its benefits, and in terms of the results of the experiment performed on the subject
page, this author can with confidence recommend that the company implement
conversion design practices into their marketing efforts. Together with traffic generating
practices such as SEO and content marketing, conversion design should be a core element
of the marketing mix.
7.2.1 Incorporating conversion design into marketing strategy and lead
generation
The case-company Hibox already deploys a sales and marketing strategy that includes a
lead generation plan, in which the corporate website plays a decisive role for gathering
sales leads (see section 2.3.1). The website is, in fact, the main lead acquisition channel
for the company but has not been designed with a conversion design approach (Turajlic
2018). In its current form the lead generation plan is completely missing a strategy for
improving conversions on a page level. The lead generation plan only includes the main
steps; visitor lands on website, navigates to form and submits enquiry (see section 2.3.1,
figure 3), but there are no practices in place for how the company actually can influence
the number and quality of leads. A systematic and structured conversion design approach
could remedy that.
Due to this fact and based on the results of this case study, conversion design should take
a central role in Hibox’s marketing strategy. As the company’s marketing strategy and
lead generation plan is primarily based online, there are two main premises responsible
for the success of the strategy: (1) generating traffic to the website and (2) converting that
traffic into leads. Making website visitors convert is essentially the most important task
of the corporate website, highlighting how important conversion design is for Hibox.
Conversion design is not only about improving the conversion rate through visual changes
and persuasion, it is about facilitating the visitor, i.e. answering their questions, speaking
their language and providing solutions to their problems. It is about “making it as easy as
possible for the user to get their work done, as quickly as possible, and as painlessly as
possible” (Leake et al. 2012, p. 142). Conversion design is customer-centric and by
improving the visitors experience on the website and tailoring the companies messaging
regarding value propositions and benefits, Hibox increases the chance of converting better
leads. With all of the above in mind, the benefits of conversion design apply to a far

134

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

greater scope than simply generating sales leads. The leads can be considered to be the
positive output of an optimal website, a website that has been made optimal for the visitor
and not only for the company through the principles of conversion design. Conversion
design therefore creates a positive user experience, improves brand equity and increases
long-term sales. These realities indicate that conversion design is a must for companies
that perform that majority of their marketing activities and lead generation online, where
the corporate website works as the main communication hub, brand identifier and lead
acquisition platform.
Additionally, optimizing the corporate website for conversions is a very cost-effective
practice with a high return on investment. Compared to ad expenditures such as pay-perclick, social media ads, display advertising etc., conversion design has zero costs. Blanks
and Jesson (2018, p. 53-54) explain this as one of the three benefits that make up the
power law of CRO (see section 4.2), namely that if marketers double their conversion rate
their marketing expenditure remains the same while their revenue doubles. This results in
a disproportionate increase in profit. With Hibox’s limited marketing budget and the
company’s focus on always maximizing return on marketing investments, conversion
design is a perfect fit for the company’s marketing strategy.
Blanks and Jesson (2018, p. 67) also suggest, as discussed in section 4.3, that conversion
design adapts an experimental approach to facilitate continuous improvement which
results in a steady upswing of conversions. Therefore, Hibox should begin applying the
conversion design principles identified in this research incrementally while testing which
conversion determinants work best for their unique visitors. Changing internal process
and incorporating new marketing tactics can be a difficult process, piloting A/B tests on
specific conversion dimensions and determinants is, therefore, a good starting point for
developing a conversion design program as part of the marketing strategy and lead
generation plan. It is also fairly easy to conduct simple A/B split tests by only changing
one specific element while leaving all other variables the same. Small changes can have
a surprisingly significant effect on the conversion rate (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 113).
Questioning common assumptions regarding determinants on the website and testing
elements even though they perform well already should be common practice within a
conversion design program (Leake et al. 2012, p. 145-146). Focusing on the various
conversion dimensions separately can help in structuring processes and tests. For
example, Hibox could strive to first measure the usability of the website to make sure that
135

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

the visitors can interact with the website according to usability best practices, before
focusing too much on advanced conversion optimization testing such as benefit statement
phrasing or CTA button placement.
Furthermore, Hibox should review their corporate website to make sure that it does not
include any redundant information or elements that either are not relevant for the visitor
or are not tailored towards the visitor or business goal. In conversion design form should
follow function, and if an element on a page does not have a clear function, it is probably
wasting digital real estate and disrupting visitor attention. It is also important that the
company begin by targeting the best performing pages in terms of traffic and conversions,
as these have the highest potential of improvement with minimum effort, and it is logical
to begin with the pages that most visitors go through to convert (Rabhan 2013, p. 91).
7.2.2 Adapting to the B2B buying process
To further develop their lead generation plan and conversion design practices, Hibox
should focus on enhancing their content strategy by creating buyer personas and
facilitating the entire journey throughout the B2B buying process. This will allow them
to tailor the on-page content to desired target segments and to visitors that are in different
stages of the buying process, which makes sure that the site facilitates as many relevant
audiences with different needs and goals as possible. In fact, this should be a prerequisite
for running tests regarding content, but simultaneously these tests will inform the buyer
personas and inform what content works best in which stage of the journey. So, utilizing
conversion design testing in the development of target audiences is advised, but beginning
with rudimentary personas and buyer funnels will provide a better basis for a conversion
design program. Rabhan (2013, p. 22-34) suggests to always begin by creating a funnel
in order to understand the buyer’s journey and finding areas on the corporate website to
improve.
To increase the sales opportunities even more, Hibox should also consider providing more
interaction points and ways of converting in addition to the current lead generation form.
Visitors that are still top-of-funnel or in the middle stages of the buyer’s journey need
other ways of showing their interest in the case-company because a sales inquiry is too
bottom-of-funnel. These visitors are not quite ready to convert into a sales lead but are
still interested in the service offering and might be a very good lead further down the
136

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

road. If a corporate website does not capture contact information from these visitors as
well, then these potential leads might be lost forever Rabhan (2013, p. 37). So called
microconversions for this purpose could consist of offering exclusive downloadable
content or access to online demos in exchange for contact information, or allowing
visitors to sign up to a newsletter. Secondary conversion points such as these would
increase the value for visitors while they also would facilitate a broader audience of
visitors, because not all visitors that are interested in the products and service offering are
ready to engage in a conversation with the sales team just yet.
Visitors in the earlier stages of the buyer’s journey are still in research mode and want to
know more to better justify their ultimate decision, i.e. choosing the right vendor. Due to
this the corporate website needs to provide the visitors with the right material, such as the
ones mentioned above (Leake et al. 2012, p. 150-151). Microconversions such as these
should also ask for as little information as possible, because visitors higher in the funnel
might have a higher threshold for giving up personal information, an email address is
essentially all one needs to pursue a lead. It is better to provide visitors with options to
engage at whatever level they are comfortable, which can range from handing over only
a name and e-mail address for a newsletter to completing a longer form for a white paper,
webinar, or demo (Halligan & Shah 2014, p. 134).
Currently there is only one type of conversion that visitors can perform on the site, which
is to submit a sales inquiry. The fact that neither the content on the site, nor the conversion
points are tailored to different stages of the buyer’s journey is probably also a contributing
reason to why many of the incoming leads never continue the discussion after an initial
response to their query (Komarov 2019), they are simply not in a stage to enter a business
relationship yet. Similarly, the company’s experience has been that the website generates
a lot of low-quality leads (Granholm 2018), which is also in part a result of the website
and conversion points not being tailored to those visitors the company considers as being
high quality leads.
Having microconversions for visitors higher up in the funnel would allow Hibox to
convert leads that they might otherwise loose, and thus generate a larger lead database
segmented according to leads’ funnel stage and the varying intents of the different
visitors. Such segmentation could be to divide leads into marketing qualified and sales
qualified leads. Currently the case-company only facilitates sales qualified leads. By also

137

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

capturing leads higher up in the funnel and segmenting them as marketing qualified, the
company would be able to create targeted campaigns through e.g. email marketing in
order to convert more website visitors into paying customers in the long run.
Tailoring content and microconversions to a funnel that represents the buyer’s journey
has quickly become common practice within inbound marketing as B2B buying behavior
has moved online as was discussed in section 4.1. B2B marketers need to engage website
visitors through content and hopefully capture their contact information. In fact, the
modern B2B buyer expects to receive informative and valuable content from the
corporate website, so much so that research predicts that 80 % of the buyer’s journey will
occur without any direct human interaction by 2020 (Butterworth 2019). This means that
buyers will move very deep into the funnel before wanting to be in contact with a sales
representative, in other words, before converting. To facilitate this Hibox must be able to
provide enough value through their website to satisfy the buyer’s journey and buyers’
need for research regarding the service offering. Studies show that over half of B2B
buyers view as many as eight pieces of content during their purchase process, and over
80 % view at least five pieces of content (Andersen, Archacki, Bellefonds & Ratajczak
2017: Demand Gen Report 2014).
7.2.3 Additional observations within the conversion dimensions
A lot of positive changes were made to the design of the subject page during this case
study, but as was discussed in section 6.3 the new design of the subject page did not attend
to all conversion determinants, nor did it perfect the design. Some negative elements still
remain and the experimental process of conversion design urges marketers to keep testing
new ideas and alternatives, regardless of whether a determinant is seen as having a
negative or positive effect on the conversion rate (Leake et al. 2012, p. 145-146). Some
additional things that the case-company should consider going forward are tailoring
content to visitor needs and optimizing the lead generation form more.
Visitor needs
By adapting conversion design to the buyer’s journey and buyer personas that represent
the target audience as described in the previous section, the case-company will also be
able to better identify the visitors’ needs. The new design facilitates this better the old,
but the company-centric communication could still be improved. Creating content should
138

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

begin from the visitors’ needs, challenges and goals to truly embody user-centered design
in a conversion design setting. The new design aims to do just that and is in many ways
successful, but it is still a presentation of the various products and features of the product
offering and the case-company, as opposed to a page that puts itself in the shoes of the
visitor and is written directly from their point of view. Every interaction is a conversation
begun by the visitor (Redish 2012, p. 2) meaning that they have unspoken questions, and
the site’s job is to answer them in a conversational you-tone.
Additionally, the case-company should focus on performing actual user research when it
comes to optimization of the website. Conversion design in itself is a form of user
research, but in order to analyze whether or not visitors are finding what they are looking
for, or if they deem the website content valuable or to identify usability issues, the easiest
way is to ask the audience. Not to mention the fact that without unbiased research,
marketers can interpret audience’s behavior incorrectly (Frick & Eyler-Werve 2015, p.
28). This can be done through focus groups and surveys for example, but they can be
difficult to organize. A far easier way to begin would be to gather feedback directly
through the website by implementing small interactive forms on the site.
Lead generation form
In the new design, only some changes were made to the lead generation form as the
primary focus of the study was on the overall design of the page. However, as the only
conversion point on the case-company’s site, the lead generation form is arguably the
most important element in the entire design. The changes that were made consisted
mainly of content-based changes that focused on incorporating the value proposition,
action-oriented wording of the heading and CTA that also described the benefit of
performing said conversion. Additionally, the layout of the form was improved by
decreasing the number of disturbing elements around the form itself. All of these changes,
however, were paramount from a conversion design point of view, but some
improvements could still be made with regards to the length and interactivity of the form.
Regarding the length of lead generation forms it is recommended to always ask for as
little information as possible (Rothman 2014, p. 113; Frick and Eyler-Werve 2015, p.
191; Gardner 2018, p. 8; Ash 2008, p. 100; Santos 2003). However, external factors affect
the amount of information a company needs to capture in order to qualify a lead. In
Hibox’s case, the sales team is small and capturing as much information in this early stage
139

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

as possible is very important for internal resource efficiency, i.e. the more info the sales
team has to go on from the beginning, the more efficient their work process (Öhman
2018). Balancing this with a user-friendly form is therefore very important. The captured
information must be sufficient for the sales team, but not too much for the user. Also, if
the forms must be relatively comprehensive, the importance of other variables such as
intuitiveness, design and appeal are multiplied.
If shortening the form is not considered a possibility then redesigning it into a multistep
form or providing additional interactive features for communication, such as a chatbot,
could be an option that facilitates those visitors that deem the form too cumbersome.
Which also is aligned with adapting to the B2B buyer’s journey as described previously.
After all, refraining visitors from converting in the first place is not desirable. Another
possibility to convince visitors to fill out the long form would be to add more incentives
such as credibility signals or additional benefits that generates trust and convinces the
visitor that completing the form is worth the effort.
Having indicators such as checkmarks or similar for an approved value in every input
field would benefit the user experience by instantly communicating the status to the
visitor, thus making the whole process smoother and more enjoyable. It would also help
in improving the error indication, as fields would be checked for errors directly after input
there would not be a need to check all fields simultaneously when the visitor hits send as
it does now, resulting in the visitor being able to actually complete the process when
clicking the CTA as he or she expects instead of getting an annoying and intrusive error
messages at such a late stage in the process.

7.3 Revisiting the hypothesized model
Throughout this thesis, it has become apparent that there is a substantial gap between
academic research and business practices within the field of lead generation and
consequently conversion design for corporate websites. The e-servicescape has indeed
been studied within the frameworks of service quality by the likes of Bitner et al. (2000);
Grönroos et al. (2000); Santos (2003) and Harris and Goode (2010) to name a few, but
the e-servicescape is not synonymous with or limited to the website as a forum and there
are other avenues within lead generation to consider than just service quality, most of
which have been discussed in this thesis. The research performed in service quality mostly
140

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

concerns e-commerce websites and not lead generation, and research on service quality
and purchase intentions do not directly connect that field to lead generation although
many parallels can be drawn between the two.
Simultaneously, there is an abundance of academic literature on various types of design
such as web design, user-centered design and interaction design, all relatively similar but
still different in certain key areas or approaches and are all considered as legitimate design
frameworks. These approaches only touch upon the subject of conversions, generally
sidelining its importance to make way for more user focused subjects. Therein lies a
misconception of conversion design; that it is too business driven and not user centric.
However, based on the extensive literature review that resulted in the hypothesized model
and the conversion experiment conducted throughout this thesis, it has been argued that
conversion design is predominantly about the website visitor. It is true that the main goal
of conversion design is to generate business driven actions that lead to new business
opportunities and an increase in revenue (Gardner 2018) but focusing on the user is a
perquisite for generating business driven actions. Therefore, conversion design should be
considered as an equally legitimate framework as any other design framework.
Conversion design as a design framework is a product of increased competition in the
digital marketplace where the battle for visitors and their purchasing power grows more
intense as the web grows. As such it is a design framework created and adopted by
business practitioners such as marketing professionals such as Gardner (2018) and Blanks
and Jesson (2018), which is probably a contributing reason as to why it has received so
little attention from academia. Most concepts within conversion design, such as
conversion rate optimization (Blanks & Jesson 2018) and landing page optimization (Ash
2008) have been proven through trial and error in the hopes of creating more leads and
sales. Conversion design is therefore based on the analysis of visitor data and adapting to
visitor behavior interpreted from that data.
The hypothesized model presented in section 5.5, figure 17 has attempted to bridge the
gap between academia and business by acknowledging theories, frameworks and
concepts relevant for conversion design from both fields and has to a degree been
successful in this embargo, as proven by the A/B split test performed on the casecompany’s webpage. As such this study has, with the hypothesized model, contributed to
the existing knowledge base of online lead generation and through the application on the

141

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

subject page it has facilitated the business need of the case-company Hibox in accordance
with the model by Hevner et al. (2004). The study has also defined conversion design on
the corporate website as having a central and critical role in B2B online lead generation.
Additionally, the term conversion design as a universal term is not in wide use today.
Conversion design as a framework has in part been created throughout this study and the
term conversion design was coined by the researcher as a holistic term for designing for
conversion. Conversion design as it has been defined here, includes and applies
methodologies from all discussed fields; e-servicescapes & service quality, landing page
optimization, conversion-centered design, conversion rate optimization and usercentered design. It is therefore suggested that the term conversion design would be
adapted for wider use amongst scholars, marketers and business practitioners. Some of
the mentioned design frameworks, such as CRO and CCD are already used in this manner
today. However, they do not incorporate frameworks and methods from all other relevant
fields as the hypothesized model of conversion design does.
Additional models that define conversion design from a broader perspective would
benefit the field of lead generation as a whole. Currently, conversion design does not have
a distinct position within lead generation and mapping that position in relevance to other
lead generation practices would help marketers and businesses to prioritize their lead
generation efforts.
It has become apparent that many of the quality determinants presented in this model are
associated with one another. They can be said to apply to multiple, or all of the
dimensions, regardless of the categorization in the model. For example, navigation is an
important factor for aesthetics and not only usability, and the design of a lead generation
form must adhere to the principles of all the dimensions. Usability and aesthetics have
also been identified to affect the trust visitors have in the website and consequently the
company and service behind the website (Harris & Goode 2010), meaning that is not only
the credibility category that is relevant when trying to evoke visitor trust, rather credibility
can be portrayed throughout the design of all dimensions. In short, the determinants are
antecedents rather than separate components within the perceived service quality. That
being said, all dimensions and determinants can have an individual effect on the
conversion rate, but they can also affect the conversion rate in combination with other
determinants irrelevant of the categorization presented in the model.

142

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

It is however suggested by this researcher that conversion design is a subject in need of
additional academic research to analyze how lead generation on the corporate website can
be enhanced further. The current state suggests that many resources from the marketplace
are based on the individual experiences of certain practitioners and companies that have
been successful within the field. These experiences remain reliable and valuable, but to
push conversion design and online lead generation into the wider field of marketing as a
generally excepted and acknowledged framework that e.g. would be taught in
universities, academical backing is required. As Santos (2003, p. 236) explains “there is
a need for web designers to understand consumers and for academic researchers to
evaluate the Internet and provide an appropriate framework”. With regard to the
hypothesized model, studies on which conversion dimension is the most critical could be
performed, additional dimensions and determinants might be discovered.

7.4 Limitations of the study and guidelines for future research
This study was limited to the corporate website of the case-company and to only one
specific subject page. The subject page was completely redesigned in order to showcase
a large variety of the conversion dimensions and determinants presented in the
hypothesized model and to facilitate the aim of the study. The subject page was designed
with the hypothesized model as a guiding framework.
A complete redesign was suitable for this study, but as many scholars suggest, marketers
should focus on performing smaller incremental changes of one conversion determinant
at a time. Multiple experiments of different conversion determinants can of course run
simultaneously, but every experiment should be confined to only one determinant
increase the reliability of the results. When testing multiple determinants at the same time
it is difficult to determine which determinants have contributed to the greatest change,
regardless whether the results are positive or negative. It can for instance be concluded
from this study, that the hypothesized model facilitates a higher conversion rate.
However, it does not explain which conversion dimension(s) or determinant(s) marketers
should prioritize, which indicates that further research could be conducted to improve the
model. The model does not either directly incorporate placement of specific on-page
elements. The above the fold area was recognized as being the most important and
frameworks such as the AIDA indicate that placement should be thoroughly considered
143

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

when designing. The model does discuss the above factors and more regarding layout and
flow, yet placement was found to be of such importance that its priority and position could
be re-evaluated in future research.
Additionally, the A/B split test was performed as a sequential test, despite the fact that
parallel testing generally generates more reliable results. When performing conversion
experiments of this kind, parallel A/B testing or even multivariate testing would be
preferred. Furthermore, conversion experimentation is not limited to the sole metric
conversion rate. The conversion rate is the ultimate judge on how well a website manages
to convert its visitors, but this is highly contextual, as every site, company, industry and
brand have different conversion rates and they are not really comparable amongst each
other. Alternative metrics, data and analysis tools that are relevant for conversion
experimentation can be e.g. scroll depth, heat maps, CTA clicks, time spent on page,
bounce rates and many others that measure how visitors interact and engage with a
webpage. With such research tools there would not be a need to use screenshots for
analysis because visitor behavior could be tracked in real-time. That data would form the
basis of analysis, which would eliminate the need for a subjective and theoretical
comparison between page and conversion principles.
As discussed in section 3.2.3, the subjective nature of the qualitative content analysis,
with the screenshots as primary data, can be considered a weakness in the research design.
However, as was already concluded in section 3.2.3, eliminating this subjectivity
completely would not have aided the study in this specific case. Ideally, the screenshots
of the designs would have been evaluated through e.g. a focus group to utilize the opinions
of real users. This would have drastically improved the validity of the results.
In accordance with performing multiple smaller and incremental tests, future research
would benefit from diving deeper into specific conversion determinants within the
specific dimensions. This study focused on creating a holistic model, which resulted in a
model that is slightly lacking in depth with regard to the individual effect of specific
conversion determinants. Granular studies on how the conversion dimensions and
determinants relate to one another and how their importance varies on different markets
and among visitors with different demographics would be a significant contribution to the
understanding of conversion design. An experiment focusing on one determinant with
multiple parallel A/B split tests or multivariate tests would give valuable insight into how

144

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

each conversion determinant relates to increasing the number of leads and how the
determinants relate to each other, i.e. if one is significantly more important than another.
Furthermore, these types of experiments would give insight into which determinants have
the greatest impact on lead quality and not just lead amount. The quality of generated
leads could be compared between determinants upon the completion of determinantspecific tests. However, studying lead quality is a field of its own and would require its
own dedicated research and tests for proper analysis.
One of the fundamentals of conversion design is to facilitate both the visitors’ goals and
the business goals, meaning that the webpage content should be tailored towards the
visitors and what they want from the page while simultaneously facilitating the business
goal. The importance of understanding the visitor and their needs cannot be understated.
Marketers should perform user research through surveys, feedback forms, focus groups,
persona creation and empathy mapping to be able to define the visitors’ goal(s) and needs
before the design process begins. This as well, however, is a research field of its own and
can be argued to be beyond the scope of conversion design, but conversion design is a
very broad and complex practice, as has been described throughout this thesis. It
incorporates multiple design practices and methodologies, of which user research is one.
Unfortunately, no extensive or detailed user research was performed in preparation for
this study. This did not affect the reliability of the results in any way but would
undoubtedly have helped in creating a better design for the subject page and would
probably have resulted in even greater improvements in the conversion rate.

SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Leadgenerering på internet inom B2B-marknadsföring –
konverteringsdesignens roll på företagswebbplatsen
Introduktion
Leadgenerering på internet är i dag en av de viktigaste metoderna för B2B-företag att
anskaffa nya potentiella kunder, d.v.s. leads. Företagswebbplatsen spelar en central roll
för att dessa potentiella kunder för det första ska hitta företaget i fråga, och för det andra
för att de ska konvertera till leads. Trots detta är det få företag som optimerar sina
webbplatser

för

att

främja

konverteringar,

m.a.o.

utnyttjar

de

inte

s.k.

konverteringsdesign. Företagswebbplatser är ofta väldigt företagscentrerade och är
således inte skräddarsydda för webbplatsens besökare. Skräddarsydda webbplatser är i
regel mera framgångsrika inom leadgenerering än de som inte är det (Blanks & Jesson
2018, s. 36). B2B-företag bör därför sträva efter att prioritera en optimal
användarupplevelse för sina besökare och tillgodose deras behov så att de vill konvertera.
Att konvertera en maximal mängd av leads är särskilt viktigt för B2B-företag eftersom
dessa företag är bundna till en väldigt lång köpprocess (Gillin and Schwartzman 2011, s.
7). Dessutom visar studier att majoriteten av företag som får mindre än 50 leads per
månad inte når sina inkomstmål (HubSpot Research 2016).
Ett företag som förlitar sig på leadgenerering på internet som en huvudsaklig
kundanskaffningsmetod är Hibox Systems Oy Ab. Hibox fungerar som uppdragsgivare
för denna avhandling. Företagets webbplats är den preliminära kanalen för lead
generering och för företagets digitala marknadsföring i sin helhet. Trots webbplatsens
onekliga betydelse i leadgenereringsprocessen har webbplatsen inte utvecklats med
konverteringsdesign som ett vägvisande koncept. Syftet med denna avhandling är således
att

med

Hibox

Systems

webbplats

som

fallstudieobjekt

undersöka

konverteringsdesignens roll för att generera mera leads.
Avhandlingen kategoriseras som en fallstudie eftersom den utgör en fördjupad
undersökning av ett samtida fenomen, d.v.s. ett fall, i fenomenets verkliga kontext (Yin
2018, s. 9-15). Fallstudien utnyttjade i först hand en kvalitativ forskningsmetod men
använde sig också av kvantitativa data för att styrka slutsatserna i den kvalitativa
146

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

undersökningen. Kombinationen av multipla forskningsmetoder och data leder till s.k.
triangulering som framställer ett pålitligare forskningsresultat.
Inom den kvalitativa undersökningen utfördes en litteraturanalys av primära kvalitativa
data som bestod av relevanta källor såsom forskningsartiklar, böcker och artiklar på
internet. Källorna omfattade således både akademiska undersökningar och källor från
yrkesvärlden.

Litteraturanalysen

producerade

en

hypotetisk

modell

för

konverteringsdesign som användes för att utveckla en ny design av en förbestämd sida på
Hibox webbplats. Den nya designen speglades sedan mot den gamla genom att analysera
skärmavbilder

på

bägge

designer.

Skärmavbilderna

evaluerades

utifrån

en

kodningsmanual som också utvecklades genom litteraturanalysen (se bilaga H, eng.
appendix H).
Leadgenerering inom B2B
Orsaken till att webbplatsen har erhållit en central roll inom leadgenerering är att en stor
del av köpprocessen inom B2B har förflyttats till webben. I takt med internets framfart
har B2B-köpare börjat använda verktyg som sökmotorer för att finna leverantörer som
passar deras behov. Tack vare detta kan köpare värdera och jämföra produkter och tjänster
på egen hand, utan att kommunicera med en enda försäljare.
Förut bestod marknadsföring i rätt hög grad av s.k. pushstrategier, även känt som
outbound marknadsföring. Marknadsförare använde olika medel för att för att komma
inom köparnas synfält, man så att säga ”tryckte” ut sitt meddelande genom bland annat
tryckta medier, tv, radio och telefonsamtal. Då hade marknadsförarna kontroll över vad
köparna såg och hur de kom i kontakt med det de såg. Idag är det köparna som har
kontrollen tack vare den oändliga mängd information de har tillgång till via internet.
Dagens marknadsföring går därför till stor del ut på pullstrategier. Denna typ av
marknadsföring baserar sig på att locka till sig köparna genom att vara synlig där köparna
finns, t.ex. i en sökmotor, och övertala dem att av egen vilja kontakta säljaren, vilket inom
leadgenerering på internet oftast betyder att konvertera genom en webbsida.
Pullstrategier är alltså väldigt lämpliga för internet (Chaffey & Smith 2013, s. 400) och
en strategi som många B2B-företag utnyttjar är s.k. inbound marknadsföring. Inbound
marknadsföring är i viss mån synonymt med pullmarknadsföring, men till skillnad från
pull så skildrar inbound ett komplett ramverk genom vilket en köpare går från att vara
147

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

totalt obekant med ett företag och dess produkter eller tjänster, till att vara en betalande
kund.
I centrum av detta ramverk finns konverteringsprocessen där köparen går från att vara
medveten om företaget och ha skapat ett intresse för dess produkter eller tjänster till att
konvertera till ett lead som vill ha mera information och möjligtvis påbörja förhandlingar
om det som företaget i fråga erbjuder. Det är här som leadgenerering och
företagswebbplatsen kommer in. Webbplatsens uppgift är att presentera värdet för
köparen genom incitament och att skapa en så pass god användarupplevelse att köparen
medvetet vill ta steget att inleda en diskussion med säljaren. Leadgenerering på internet
av denna typ karaktäriseras av att köparen inte har någon människokontakt innan hen
konverterat. Således sker konverteringen i ett självbetjäningssyfte. Detta faktum betonar
vikten

av

webbplatsen

och

dess

förmåga

att

konvertera

köpare

i

leadgenereringsprocessen.
Konverteringsdesign på företagswebbplatsen
För att definiera konverteringsdesign som koncept bör man analysera alla former av
webbdesign som på ett eller annat sätt berör konverteringar. De mest relevanta
ramverken, forskningsområdena och koncepten inom marknadsföring idag är
användarcentrerad design, konverteringsgradsoptimering, landningstidsoptimering och
tjänstekvalitet i det virtuella tjänstelandskapet, d.v.s. webbplatsen (Nielsen 2000;
Chaffey & Smith 2013; Blanks & Jesson 2018; Ash 2008; Harris & Goode 2010; Santos
2003). För att förstå hur konverteringsgraden kan påverkas måste marknadsförare förstå
vad besökare värdesätter (Yang et al. 2004, s. 1150) och således identifiera vilka element
på en webbsida som är relevanta för att öka konverteringsgraden.
Bland alla de koncept som nämndes ovan kan man hitta diverse gemensamma nämnare
för virtuella tjänstelandskap i form av dimensioner som skildrar de helheter som bör
bearbetas för att förbättra tjänstekvaliteten, användarupplevelsen och mängden
konverteringar. Dessa konverteringsdimensioner utgör alltså de viktigaste områdena
inom konvertertingsdesign. Konverteringsdimensionerna är användbarhet, estetik,
innehåll och trovärdighet (se tabell 4 i kapitel 4.5). Utifrån dessa dimensioner kan man
ytterligare definiera diverse konverteringsdeterminanter som skildrar de specifika
element på webbsidan som marknadsförare bör optimera för att nå en maximal mängd
148

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

konverteringar. För varje dimension finns det två till fyra determinanter. Dimensionen
estetik utgörs av determinanterna typografi, färg och kontrast och bilder.
Innehållsdimensionen utgörs av skriven text, handlingsuppmaningar och innehåll
skräddarsytt för besökaren. Dimension användbarhet utgörs i sin tur av navigering,
layout och stilrenhet samt interaktivitet, medan den sista dimensionen trovärdighet består
av socialt bevis samt prestanda och säkerhet. Tillsammans utgör dimensionerna och
determinanterna den hypotetiska modellen för konverteringsdesign. Modellen illustreras
i figur 17 (se kapitel 5.5) och är utformad efter Harris och Goodes (2010) konceptuella
modell för ökad köpintention inom virtuella tjänstelandskap. Genom optimering av
determinanterna tillfredsställs varje konverteringsdimension vilket följaktligen leder till
att besökaren upplever visuell tillfredsställelse, att innehållet uppfyller besökarens behov,
att webbplatsen är lätt att använda och att den framkallar förtroende mellan besökaren
och säljaren. Tillsammans påverkar allt detta besökarens upplevda tjänstkvalitet som
förbättrar användarupplevelsen, vilket enligt den hypotetiska modellen leder till en ökad
konverteringsgrad.
Förutom konverteringsdimensionerna och dess determinanter, är ett specifikt område på
alla webbsidor särdeles viktigt inom konverteringsdesign, nämligen den första vyn som
besökare ser (Goward 2013, s. 162). Med första vy menas den initiala vy av en webbsida
som en besökare ser, d.v.s. den allra översta delen av sidan. Den första vyn är ytterst
viktig eftersom det är här som besökarna väljer ifall de tänker stanna på sidan eller
navigera vidare till nästa webbplats. Den första vyn måste därför kommunicera värdet,
möta besökarens behov och indikera att det finns mera relevant information längre ner på
sidan. Alla konverteringsdimensioner kan sägas vara av relevans i den första vyn p.g.a.
dess betydelse för besökaren.
Resultat
Den gamla designen (se bilaga F, eng. appendix F) på den förutbestämda sidan på Hibox
webbplats visade sig vara bristfällig ur en konverteringsdesignsynvinkel. I sin helhet hade
sidan en logisk och tydlig struktur, den presenterade relevant information och inkluderade
grundläggande konverteringsdeterminanter som t.ex. handlingsuppmaningar. Men det
var tydligt att den gamla designen inte tillfredsställde de flesta dimensioner i den

149

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

hypotetiska modellen, och även de konverteringsdeterminanter som kunde identifieras på
sidan var bristfälliga och uppfyllde inte sin fulla potential.
Den nya designen (se bilaga G, eng. appendix G) på Hibox webbplats däremot, kan
konstateras ha förbättrat webbsidan ur en konverteringssynvinkel. Förutom att själva
designen har många tydliga förbättringar i både enskilda konverteringsdeterminanter och
dimensioner, ökade också konverteringsgraden som ett resultat av den hypotetiska
modellen. Jämfört med den gamla designen har den nya designen signifikanta
förbättringar på hela första halvan av webbsidan. Särskilt den första vyn har genomgått
markanta förbättringar genom det nya innehållet som finns där. Den gamla designens
största svaghet var nämligen den översta delen av sidan. Den förbättrade första vyn ökar
chanserna för att skapa ett gott första intryck hos besökarna och således ökar chansen att
besökare hålls kvar på sidan och tar del av det presenterade innehållet.
Även om sidan utvecklades med den hypotetiska modellen som guide så finns det ännu
utrymme för förbättring. I alla dimensioner förutom estetikdimensionen finns det ännu
negativa konverteringsdeterminanter på webbsidan. Oberoende så är den nya designen en
signifikant förbättring av den gamla.
Den

hypotetiska

modellen

bevisades

också

vara

en

lämplig

modell

för

konverteringsdesign genom ökningen av konverteringsgraden. Konverteringsgraden
mättes över en period på ett år (2019) och jämfördes sedan med föregående period (2018)
då webbsidan ännu hade den gamla designen. Av de 12 månader som mättes var det
endast två som upplevde en lägre konverteringsgrad än föregående period. Den
genomsnittliga ökningen för hela perioden var en ökning på 32,73 %, från en
konverteringsgrad som låg på 2,18 % för 2018 till 2,90 % för 2019. Den genomsnittliga
månatliga ökningen år 2019 var 53,10 %.
Slutsats
Avhandlingens resultat visar att företag verkligen kan öka mängden leads genom design
och att företagswebbsidan spelar en central roll i leadgenereringsprocessen samt B2Bmarknadsföring. Den hypotetiska modellen bevisades vara ett lämpligt ramverk för att
utveckla

konverteringsdesignen

av

en

företagswebbsida

och

således

öka

konverteringsgraden. Under studiens lopp framgick det att det finns en signifikant klyfta
mellan

den

akademiska

världen

och

företagsvärlden

när

det

handlar

om
150

M.Lehtinen: Online Lead Generation in B2B Marketing

konverteringsdesign och leadgenerering. Företagsvärlden har utvecklat diverse ramverk,
modeller och koncept för att öka konverteringsgraden på företageswebbplatser, något
som drivits framåt av ökad konkurrens på digitala marknader. Akademisk forskning
ligger däremot efter och väldigt få studier finns att hitta angående konverteringsdesign,
leadgenerering och inbound marknadsföring överlag. Marknadsförare bör förstå sina
konsumenter, men akademisk forskning bör evaluera internet och bistå med lämpliga
ramverk (Santos 2003, s. 236). Därför är fortsatt forskning för att utveckla den
hypotetiska modellen att rekommendera. Modellen som presenteras i denna avhandling
har skapat en tillräcklig helhetsmodell ur ett holistiskt perspektiv, men de specifika
dimensionerna samt determinanterna bör undersökas på djupet. Hur dimensionerna och
determinanterna förhåller sig till varandra, vilka av dessa som har störst inflytande på
konverteringsgraden och hur deras betydelse skiljer sig från varandra mellan besökare
från olika marknader eller med olika demografiska och kulturella särdrag är goda exempel
för fortsatt undersökning. Ytterligare borde konverteringsdimensionernas möjliga
påverkan på kvaliteten av leads undersökas, d.v.s. hur marknadsförare kan öka kvaliteten
av leads och inte bara mängden genom design.
För uppdragsgivaren Hibox del har avhandlingen bevisat att företaget kan öka sin
konverteringsgrad genom design. Därför rekommenderas att Hibox inkluderar
konverteringsdesign

som

ett

grundläggande

koncept

och

praxis

i

sin

marknadsföringsstrategi, och att företaget strukturerar sina leadgenereringsprocesser för
att möta den moderna köpprocessen inom B2B.

Aesthetics
First impression (first screenful):

(+) No distracting visual elements.
(-) Excessive whitespace. There is room for adding elements that are beneficial for the visitor.
Visual hierarchy:
(+) Product images with links to more detailed pages are clearly dominant on the page [2].
(+) All on-page elements are well balanced size-wise.
(-) Heading in the first screenful is very small in comparison to available space [1].
(-) Visitors are immediately ushered to navigate to a more detailed product page due to the emphasis on
these links [2].

Color:
(+) The color palette is based on brand colors which portray a professional image.
(+) Colors are well balanced with each other.
(+) The page uses a cool color theme.

icons and some headings and links [3, 4, 5].

(+) The use of various background colors clearly separates the different sections from one another.

Contrast:

clearly separate from each other.
(+) The light blue is clearly distinguishable from the other colors.
(-) The gray background color at the bottom of the page is not as distinguishable from the white
background as the other colors and combined with greyscale logos at the bottom of the page appear rather
flat due to the lack of contrast but is still readable [8].

Imagery & directional ques:
(+) The page utilizes product images [2].
(+) Icons and vector illustrations are used to support the value proposition and placed in relevant context
[4, 9].
(-) There are no images of people.
(-) The number of icons and symbols is low.
(-) No directional ques that draw attention to high-value or converting elements.
(-) The moving background image is a nice design feature but draws visitor attention away from
important elements.
Content
Above the fold:

important information quickly.
(-) The design does not include or highlight any high-value elements.

(-) URL does not match the label for the page in menu item, nor does it match the heading on the page or
other content in the first screenful.
(-) The navigation menu is limited to one page per menu item and thus the highest level in the hierarchy,
sub-pages deeper in the information architecture are then linked from these top priority pages. This results
in sub-pages being more difficult to find since they are not included in the main navigation. The visitor
also gets lost more easily due to this, see appendix K.

engage with the page [7].

the button, invites to be pressed [5].

Lead generation form:

visually appealing.

and generic questions.

visitor attention away from completing the form, especially when placed above the form where the
visitor’s attention is first directed [17].
