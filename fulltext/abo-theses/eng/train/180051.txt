Title: Designing for first impressions: How do visually salient elements influence first
impressions of web pages?
Supervisor: D.Sc. Anna Sell
Abstract: New online businesses emerge every day, contributing to an overflow of unknown
vendors that rely solely on their online presence. As the number of unfamiliar online entities
without any offline presence grows, there is a need to understand how visual web design
decisions impact users’ impressions and the sense of trust. When there is no prior interaction
with a web page, the user’s first impression has a significant impact. First impressions in the
context of HCI are influenced by the visual design of a web page, which subsequently is
influenced by viewing behavior and the saliency of design elements.
An online survey was executed to explore how visually salient design elements influence
the user’s perception of appeal, trustworthiness, overall impression, and the prospect of further
use. Participants viewed six different fictional web pages with an exposure time of four
seconds. The results revealed that judgments of appeal do not affect perceptions of
trustworthiness; however, an impact was seen on overall impression ratings and the prospect
of further use. Repeated measures ANOVA’s for appeal ratings revealed highly statistically
significant pairings between stimuli, indicating that differences in design significantly
influenced ratings of appeal.
Conducted one-way ANOVA’s demonstrated that age or gender differences did not
significantly impact how the participants rated the web pages. Additionally, the study’s results
revealed that the lack of a visually significant element and a clear entry point does not generate
indifferent results. In its entirety, the study confirms prior first impression research regarding
the impact of visual appeal on first impressions and illustrates the importance of visual
prototypicality and aesthetic treatment.

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

1 INTRODUCTION
New businesses emerge every day, and progressively more companies decide to launch
their business with only an online presence, contributing to an overflow of new and
unknown actors. These unfamiliar actors have the same goal: to grasp the same users’ and
consumers’ interests. As the number of online entities without any offline presence grows,
the users become more critical and apprehensive towards new webpages and systems.
What makes users choose to interact with one web page over another when an abundance
of other options are at hand? The challenge for online entities may not necessarily be
attracting visitors since most users are used to aimlessly browsing the Internet. The
challenge is to convince the user to stay and to interact with the web page.
Even for businesses with distinctive offline presences, a web page is notably relevant in
order for companies to attain new and maintain existing consumers. For new entities
without an offline presence, a successful web page is all the more essential. When there
is no prior interaction with a vendor or a web page, the user’s first impression has a
significant impact on whether or not the user chooses to interact or even stay on the
webpage for more than a few minutes. Research has revealed that both positive and
negative first impressions can have long-lasting effects on user perceptions and
intentions, thus, suggesting that first impressions should attentively be considered when
designing web pages (Lindgaard, Fernandes, Dudek, & Brown, 2006).
First impressions of web pages are formed rapidly. Research confirms that long-lasting
first impressions are formed as quickly as within the first 50 milliseconds of the user’s
exposure to a web page’s visual design and content (Lindgaard et al., 2006). The fact that
first impressions arise within milliseconds of exposure indicates that first impressions are
developed already before users have had the time to consciously reflect on what they have
seen or had any time to process the content in front of them. The actuality that first
impressions are formed mostly without conscious reflection makes visual design and
visual communication critical. Suggesting that in order to create compelling, attentiongrabbing, and succeeding web pages, it is imperative to understand the factors that weigh
in and attract the subconscious attention of the user, as well as obtaining insight into what

1

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

makes the user subconsciously feel like the web page is reliable enough for further
investigation and continued use.

1.1 Objective and purpose
This study aims to gain insight into first impressions of web pages and how they are
formed, specifically how visual design elements impact the formation and outcome of
these first impressions. First impressions in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are
highly relevant since users continuously form influencing impressions while browsing,
searching, and performing tasks on the Internet. First impressions are formed of new
systems, web pages, applications, and even new visual content that a familiar entity might
present. Being aware of the impact and the possibilities that first impressions have can
help designers and developers create designs that are as good as possible and generate the
best possible first impression. Additionally, understanding what the user first fixates on
and possibly overlooks, provides insight into how web page designers and developers can
influence the user’s impressions as well as create better user experiences.
With an extensive user population online, it is imperative to understand viewing patterns
and their impact on forming impressions. Furthermore, understanding how web pages are
viewed and perceived will also demonstrate the significance of first impressions, how
they are formed, and how they impact web page users. As the online environment consists
mainly of visual elements, it is also essential to recognize the effect that specific design
decisions can have on user perceptions as well as user attention (Kahn, 2017). User
attention subsequently influences how web pages are viewed and how the visual
information is processed. Faraday (2000) argued that visually salient elements guide
visual attention and that these visually salient elements are hierarchical, proposing that
certain design elements are consistently processed before others and capture the user’s
attention before anything else.

1.2 Research questions
The thesis's main objective is to obtain an understanding of pre-use first impressions
within the HCI context. As well as explore the impact that visual design elements have
on first impressions and how these obtained impressions influence the perception of core
principals within web page use. The following research questions have been defined to
support the research objective:
1. What influences pre-use first impressions in an HCI context?
2. According to Faraday’s visual hierarchy, how do visually salient elements
influence pre-use first impression perceptions of visual appeal, trust, overall
impressions, and further use?

1.3 Structure of thesis
The thesis is structured as follows; the introduction will be followed by a literature review
of relevant research within the thesis’s scope in chapter two. Previous research regarding
web pages, how they are constructed, viewed, and used will be presented (section 2.1 and
2.2), as well as the use of visual elements and visual salience within the context of web
pages (section 2.3). Relevant literature and research of first impressions will be
introduced, including practical implications of first impressions (section 2.4 and 2.5). In
its entirety, the literature review will provide an extensive answer to the first research
question; what influences pre-use first impressions within an HCI context.
Following the literature review, in chapter three, the research methodology will present
the chosen method and provide a motivation for the selected approach by presenting
alternative methods and comparing both quantitative and qualitative methods (section 3.1
and 3.2). Followed by the application of the chosen method and data collection, with the
main focus on the survey design and the included stimuli design (section 3.3).

The results and an analysis of the obtained data will be presented in chapter four,
including a descriptive analysis and a quantitative analysis, conducted with one-way
ANOVA’s and repeated measures ANOVA’s (sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3). The results will
be discussed in chapter five, providing main findings, possible practical implications as
well as limitations, and possible further research. A Swedish summary is included at the
end of the thesis in chapter six.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW
The following chapter introduces and defines key concepts of the thesis, providing an
insight into previous research made within web page viewing behavior and first
impressions through a literature review. Additionally, as relevant information associated
with web page viewing behavior and first impressions, the chapter will review the
construct of web pages, visual design, and web page use.

2.1 Web page construct
Web pages have, throughout the past three decades, developed in their usability and visual
design. With new technology and increasing knowledge, the options are endless. Still,
there remain some key features to consider. According to Thielsch, Blotenberg, and Jaron
(2014), successful web pages are combinations of relevant content, highly perceived
usability, and aesthetic design; hence, constructed of three main pillars: content, usability,
and aesthetics, each construct being able to treat separately. These three pillars influence
how users perceive and rate the web page, thus making them essential factors in the
construct of first impressions as well as influencing elements of viewing behavior
(Thielsch et al., 2014). Since content is the primary reason a user visits a web page, it has
been considered to be of great importance. Content is defined by ISO 9241-151 (2006) as
content objects placed in a user interface, a content object defined as an “interactive or
non-interactive object containing information represented by text, image, video, sound or
other types of media” (p. 3). Usability is defined as the degree of efficiency and
satisfaction through which the user utilizes a product or system to achieve its goals (ISO,
1998). Usability can further be divided into inherent and apparent usability,
distinguishing usability as either objective or subjective. Apparent usability is regarded
as subjective, thus highlighting the importance of the user’s perception and usability
evaluation (Thielsch et al., 2014).
Aesthetics is a term that researchers have been struggling to define since it can mean
various things depending on the context. Aesthetics is repeatedly used synonymously
with visual appeal and beauty (Tuch, Presslaber, Stöcklin, Opwis, & Bargas-Avila, 2012).
5

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Nonetheless, the perception of beauty is subjective, and no general definition of what is
considered to be beautiful has been established. However, Moshagen and Thielsch (2010)
define aesthetics within the construct of web pages as follows:
“an immediate pleasurable subjective experience that is directed toward an object and
not mediated by intervening reasoning” (p. 3).
Tuch et al. (2012) suggested that aesthetics is evaluated through aesthetic appraisal and
aesthetic judgment. Subjective experiences, valued as positive, are considered aesthetic
appraisals. Normative criteria and thoughts of attributes that should be regarded as
aesthetic are aesthetic judgments. Aesthetic appraisal and judgment influence how we
perceive and assess the level of appeal of the visual stimulus. The assessed level of appeal
influences our first impression and judgment of the system or webpage as a whole (Tuch
et al., 2012).

2.1.1 User experience and visual design
User experience is a widely used concept, constituting different aspects. Albert and Tullis
(2013) define user experience as a measure or observation of a user’s experience. Their
definition includes three defining characteristics: “(1) a user is involved, (2) that same
user is interacting with a system, product or interface, (3) the user’s experience is
measurable, or observable” (Albert & Tullis, 2013). It is essential to distinguish between
usability and user experience since it is commonly mistaken to indicate the same thing.
However, usability is a part, and an important one, contributing to the entire user
experience. Usability measures how easily a user can carry out possible tasks. User
experience observes the user’s entire interaction, considering feelings, thoughts, and
perceptions (Albert & Tullis, 2013).
In the context of HCI, the visual design of a system or a web page user interface has the
ability to impact the user's experience altogether. The purpose of visual design is to
strategically implement design elements to enhance user engagement, interest, desired
perception, and aesthetic appeal (Michailidou, Harper, & Bechhofer, 2008). A successful
6

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

visual design increases the interaction value and is carefully calculated to serve the need,
knowledge, and purpose of the visit for existing and desired users. The main visual design
elements are agreed upon to be: lines, shapes, colors, textures, typography, and form.
Features like motion, images, symmetry, and position are also considered elements of
visual design. In a technological graphic user interface (GUI), buttons, icons, text fields,
windows, and pull-down or pop-up screens are categorized as design elements (Lynch,
1994). Design elements are generally placed according to design principles, which are
informal guidelines for designers developed throughout the years. The most common
design principles are unity, gestalt, space, hierarchy, balance, contrast, scale, dominance,
similarity, and complexity (White, 2011). Design principles' primary function is to guide
the viewers to comprehend the visually encoded information easily (Agrawala, Li, &
Berthouzoz, 2011). An effective visual presentation aims to help the users navigate,
interact, and understand the content effortlessly. Form, content, and cognition influence
the perception of visual stimulus. Furthermore, cognition influences how the user
retrieves and adopts the information it has retrieved (Michailidou et al., 2008).

2.2 Web page viewing behavior
Web pages are often a “combination of textual, pictorial and multimedia content” (Pan et
al., 2004), differing from other traditional visual stimuli. Thus, meaning that web pages
are viewed differently from images, even though web pages could be defined as complex
images. As design patterns and general design guidelines for web pages have emerged, it
has simultaneously contributed to users' expectations of how to view web pages and
where specific elements are typically placed (Buscher, Cutrell, & Morris, 2009). How
web pages are viewed can be explained by studying the eye movement behavior of the
user. Eye movements are categorized as either fixations or saccades. Fixations are
motionless gazes, lasting about 200 - 300 milliseconds, whereas saccades are eye gazes
moving continuously and rapidly between fixations (Pan et al., 2004). Generally, visual
information is processed and perceived only during fixations, when the eye movements
stay still for a brief moment (Buscher et al., 2009).

7

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Eye-movements are guided by how the image is processed, either through a bottom-up or
top-down process. The bottom-up process is determined by saliency; in other words, the
viewing process is influenced by the saliency of the content as well as the visual
complexity of the stimulus (Sutcliffe & Namoune, 2008). The bottom-up process is rapid
and naturally a subconscious process; the gaze is guided by low-level aspects of images
such as contrast, color, and luminance. The top-down process has been challenging to
define. It is considered to be governed by the user's goals, tasks, and knowledge of similar
types of visual stimuli. Since the user's interests heavily influence the top-down process,
the eye-movements are primarily directed towards areas that the user finds cognitively
compelling (Nyström & Holmqvist, 2008).

2.2.1 Web page viewing patterns
Web page viewing patterns provide insight into how users read and scan web pages; even
though users are different and have different intentions, eye-movements exhibit general
patterns governed by the web page’s construction and the processing of visual content.
Nielsen (2006) argued that the most common viewing pattern is the F-shaped pattern. As
seen in figure 1, the F-shaped viewing pattern starts at the top left corner of a web page,
the user’s gaze continuing with a horizontal movement across the top of the page, thus
creating the top bar of the letter F. The scanning continues downward, followed by a
shorter horizontal movement creating the lower bar of the letter F. Finally, with a motion
along the left side of the page, the stem of the letter is created.
The user’s tendency to exhibit the F-shaped viewing pattern comes with a few
implications that predominantly affects the positioning of content on the web page. Since
users rarely read through a text in a word-by-word manner, the most important
information needs to be located in the first two paragraphs. According to Nielsen (2006),
the user is even less inclined to skim through the content found further down the page,
concluding that most fixations fall at the first lines of a text. The following lines receive
significantly fewer fixations. The same applies to sentences; most fixations fall at the first
few words, located on the left-hand side, whereas the following words in the same line
receive fewer fixations (Pernice, 2017). However, it is essential to keep in mind that the
8

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Nielsen’s (2006) research focused on scanning patterns mostly related to text scanning
and reading, meaning that the tendency to exhibit the F-shaped patterns might differ
regarding image dominated web pages.

Figure 1: The F-shaped viewing pattern

Most users exhibit similar browsing behavior on the Internet, expecting to find what they
seek with the least amount of effort. The user’s desire to be as efficient as possible is
considered the reason for the F-shaped viewing pattern’s frequent appearance. Research
implies that the F-shaped viewing pattern arises due to text formatting, efficiency, and
commitment. If the text on the web page lacks clear and coherent formatting, there is no
direction for the users to find critical information, leading the user to create a path of its
own. This path is most likely to be the path that takes the user the least effort (Pernice,
2017). Even though the F-shaped pattern has been proven to be a reasonably dominant
viewing pattern for web pages, Pernice (2017) suggests a number of other viewing
patterns. For instance, in the spotted pattern, the user ignores large chunks of text and is
most likely scanning for something specific. In the layer-cake pattern, the user limits its
scanning to headings and subheadings, the pattern containing mostly horizontal lines. A
viewing pattern that is not so typical is the commitment pattern. The user fixates on nearly
everything in the commitment pattern, thoroughly reviewing the web page and its content
(Pernice, 2017).
9

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Shen and Zhao (2014) emphasize in their research that web page viewing differs from
natural viewing patterns since web page viewing patterns focus on the top-left corner.
According to their study, most of the first, second, and even third fixations fall in the topleft region. Specifically, first fixations tend to fall in the center “position that is slightly
toward top-left corner” (Shen & Zhao, 2014). The second and third fixations fall in the
direction of the top-left corner, however, still more towards the center of the page. A
positional bias of the top-left region is achieved by the preference of placing objects or
texts in the area. Logos, large texts, and objects in the center’s trajectory or the top-left
region attract first fixations’ attention. Shen and Zhao (2014) suggest that fixations tend
to cluster at the top-left corner and center of the page; subsequently, the cluster starts to
diversify after a few seconds.

2.2.2 Drivers of viewing behavior and patterns
Viewing patterns are guided by searching and scanning; searching refers to the user’s
attempt to find an entry point into the web page, whereas scanning refers to the user’s
behavior after locating an entry point (Djamasbi, Siegel, & Tullis, 2011). In the scanning
process, the user is susceptible to the information located in the entry point’s periphery.
The searching and scanning processes are mainly influenced by visual design elements
and the manipulation of them, i.e., the point of entry can be manipulated by: “size, color,
location, text style and visual information (images) of components” (Djamasbi et al.,
2011). Furthermore, the scanning process is influenced by proximity and the general
placement of web page components. Components close together are usually perceived as
being related to each other, thus, being processed together. When related information is
placed in close proximity, the user’s scanning becomes more effective, and the experience
more pleasurable (Djamasbi et al., 2011).
According to Buscher et al.’s (2009) research, the salience of elements direct first
fixations and subsequent fixations are directed by expectations and general knowledge of
where to find specific content — indicating that the salience of elements influences the
searching process and that the user’s expectations influence the scanning process.
Thus, suggesting that three different aspects govern viewing behavior: 1) the features of
10

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

the web page itself, 2) the user’s expectations of where to find relevant information, 3)
the user’s underlying task or need of information (Buscher et al., 2009). In order to
influence viewing patterns, web designers need to consider how visual elements are
applied, the placement of these visual elements, the primary reason for the user’s visit,
and the user’s expectations.

2.2.3 Visual salience
The saliency of objects has a significant impact on which objects are perceived and how.
The user’s first fixations are influenced by the most visually salient elements displayed,
meaning that the object or region that stands out the most will be processed and noted
first. Since the human brain is constantly scanning its surroundings, it cannot apprehend
or process every received input. Therefore, the brain processes regions and objects
separately, focusing on the most salient feature to process first (Peters & Itti, 2007).
Treisman & Gelade (1980) formed a framework for how visual salience is computed. To
determine which of the objects or regions are the most salient, a saliency map is
constructed of the incoming visual information. Visual neurons, sensitive to visual
stimuli, analyze the visual information, and compute a saliency map. The most salient
features are highlighted in the saliency map, thereby subconsciously influencing the
user’s gaze. The objects or regions that are determined as most salient are processed and
perceived first.
The impact of visual salience is based on visual salience bias. When the user processes
images and displays, the first fixation consistently focuses on the most visually salient
object in the image or display (Kahn, 2017). Because of the visual salience bias and how
visual information is processed, visually salient objects are more likely to be given
attention. According to prior research, the effect of visual salience bias can be long-lasting
and generally influences the user’s choices more than the user’s personal preferences
(Kahn, 2017). The visual salience bias has an even more prominent effect when the user
has a heavy cognitive load.

11

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

According to Peters and Itti (2007), visual salience is based on stimulus-driven signals;
the signals communicate to the user that particular objects or regions are significantly
different from the surrounding and worthy of attention. Visually salient objects or areas
are reasonably similar independent from the observer. However, changes in surrounding
stimuli and context can generate different saliency maps. Since the saliency of elements
depends on the context and surrounding stimuli, it is difficult to determine specific salient
objects. In natural environments where highly salient items are present, a perceptual
salience occurs, which is effortlessly and automatically computed (Itti & Koch, 2000).
Treisman and Gelade (1980) introduced different instances on how visual salience is
processed differently according to the context and surrounding stimuli, simple display
being one of them, where the user’s attention immediately is drawn to the most salient
item in the visual display. In the simple display, very little to none scanning of the display
occurs, suggesting that the visual information is processed all at once. Treisman and
Gelade (1980) named visual displays without significantly salient objects as conjunction
targets. The absence of significantly salient objects causes the user aimlessly to scan the
display in search of something captivating. Displays containing numerous items that
contribute little to visual salience do not influence attention to be drawn in any particular
location. However, in displays with only one or a few significant visually salient items,
the items will be highly attention-drawing since they are substantially different from the
rest.

2.2.4 Visual hierarchy
Visual salience in the context of HCI is affiliated with visual search and decision-making.
Web designers use images, headlines, icons, call-to-action-buttons, among others, to
direct attention. By making the objects colorful and stand out from the rest of the website,
the objects become salient (Kahn, 2017). However, web pages can be filled with salient
objects making distinct predictions difficult. However, web pages can be full of salient
elements making distinct predictions difficult. Faraday (2000) developed a visual
scanning model identifying a hierarchy between six different, visually salient features:
motion, size, image, color, text-style, and position. The visual hierarchy is formed by the
user’s perception and interpretation of the objects’ importance visually presented in the
12

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

user interface. The function of a visual hierarchy is ultimately to guide the user’s viewing
pattern. The elements that are the most visually salient are categorized as the most
important, thus, viewed first. Faraday (2000) proposed the following hierarchy among
visual design features:
1. Motion
2. Size
3. Image
4. Color
5. Text-style
6. Position
The visual user interface can easily be an overwhelming environment for the user. In
order for the user to process information efficiently and not overlook vital information,
there is a need for guidance. The visual hierarchy assists the user in “what to do, how to
do it, and what to expect” (Schlatter & Levinson, 2013). According to Faraday (2000), a
flat visual display lacking salient items and a hierarchy can lead to poor user experiences.
The user does not know what is essential nor where to focus. Furthermore, a web design
where too many objects are highlighted contributes to a cluttered design where nothing is
emphasized.
Faraday’s (2000) model consists of two stages, the search phase, and the scanning phase.
The search phase is the phase where the user finds its entry point. Per Faraday’s (2000)
model, the searching phase is guided by motion, size, images, color, text-style, and
position. The scanning phase is where the user extracts information from the elements in
the entry point’s proximity. The hierarchy of the objects determines the entry point. If an
element of motion is excluded, the size feature will determine the entry point. If both
motion and size are not a factor, an image is the next plausible entry point. The entry
point’s determination continues hierarchically for color, text-style, and position, given
that none of the features mentioned above being visually more salient (Faraday, 2000).

13

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

A web design with an impactful viewing pattern is designed so that crucial information
has more prominence or visual weight than elements that are considered less critical.
Visually prominent elements tend to draw more attention and are thus perceived as more
critical (Schlatter & Levinson, 2013). Using visually prominent elements, web page
designers can create desired entry points; since the entry point is the first element or
region that the user processes, it heavily influences the rest of the user experience and
how web pages are perceived. A viewing pattern guided by visual hierarchy can be altered
by the positioning and manipulation of elements in the interface, with changes such as a
variation in sizes, different use of color, use of interface types (i.e., buttons and links),
and general treatments of elements (Schlatter & Levinson, 2013). In order for the visual
design to guide the user, designers can use elements that carry different visual weight.
The features are categorized as dominant, sub-dominant, or subordinate, distinct from
most to least important (Still, 2018). Dominant elements are attention-drawing and carry
a lot of visual weight, whereas subordinate elements rarely attract attention. Subdominant elements have lesser visual weight and are created through different use of color
and contrast. Since the scanning phase follows the initial searching phase, it is essential
to consider what kind of elements are placed around the entry point and their classification
(i.e., dominant, sub-dominant, or subordinate).
Faraday’s model of visual hierarchy and entry points has, later on, received criticism. The
model was developed to examine the distribution of attention on a web page interface and
predict the user’s entry points. According to Still’s (2018) study, Faraday's (2000) model
is inadequate in predicting entry points. Still (2018) used web page stimulus with clear
entry points to examine the model; the overall results were dissatisfactory. From the
proposed visually salient elements, position was the only element that reached a
satisfactory result. Color and text-style did a fair job, whereas size and image failed as
entry points. Grier (2004; see Shen & Zhao, 2014) also questioned Faraday’s model,
concluding that the model is not sufficient for more complex web page viewing patterns
presented today. Faraday formulated the visual hierarchy model almost two decades ago,
and during that time, web design has developed immensely. Still’s results demonstrate
the need for an updated model for predicting entry points, adjusted to today’s design
practice. However, the elements proposed in Faraday’s (2000) original research are still
significant in investigating users’ viewing behaviors and viewing patterns.

2.3 Phases of web page use
When using a web page, the user goes through a series of phases. Research has suggested
that web page use entails “an exposure and impression formation phase, an evaluation
and use phase,” (Thielsch et al., 2014) and finally, the user’s intentional outcomes.
Thielsch et al. (2014) suggested a differentiation of three phases:
1. Pre-use first impression phase
2. Post-use overall impression phase
3. Intention formation phase
The pre-use impression phase is the phase where the initial first impression is formed. In
this phase, the user is only exposed to the web page’s visual stimulus and has not yet had
the time to cognitively process the content (Tuch et al., 2012) In the post-use overall
impression phase, the user matches the first impression of the visual content to the
impression formed by using the user interface. In this phase, content and usability are
influencing elements, as opposed to the pre-use first impression phase, where the visual
stimulus is generally the only influencing element. In the last phase, where intentions
towards the web page are built, the user forms its intentions for further use, intent to buy,
and intent to recommend or visit again (Thielsch et al., 2014).
As these three presented phases of web page use are all interlinked, it highlights the
importance of creating a positive impression throughout the user’s web page use in order
to impress the user, regardless of the desired outcome. However, further into this thesis,
prior conducted research will be introduced, demonstrating that creating a positive preuse impression carries a lot of weight since it heavily influences the following phases.

2.4 First impressions
First impressions are crucial when developing an opinion of something, as well as when
determining subsequent actions. Fundamental research made by Lindgaard et al. (2006)
has demonstrated that reliable first impressions are formed as fast as within 50

15

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

milliseconds of exposure. First impressions influence human behavior in various
situations and to a different extent, with both mid-and long-term effects (Tuch et al.,
2012). The subject of first impressions has been a compelling topic for researchers, and
research has been conducted within; psychology, marketing, usability, and so on. First
impressions is variously defined, and the apparent effects are different, considering the
context. Within marketing, the first impression is considered to be a quick evaluation that
habitually influences the overall impression of a product or consultant (Sheng,
Lockwood, & Dahal, 2013). In the context of HCI, first impressions could be similarly
explained. A first impression could be seen as an initial rapid evaluation of a web page,
system, or application, contributing to the formed impression.
Sheng et al. (2013) suggested that attention and interpretation of information are the main
activities that influence the impression formation process. The formation of a first
impression is seen as an active process, where the user gathers information, organizes it,
and forms a representation of what is seen. Users initially categorize what they see based
on salient features, such as “color, images, use of font, font size, the position of items”
(Sheng et al., 2013). Research conducted by Lindgaard et al. (2006) and Tuch et al. (2012)
exhibit that impression formation and information processing start within milliseconds of
exposure. Thielsch et al. (2014) argue that since impression formation is so rapid,
differentiating immediate and deliberate first impressions is important. Immediate first
impressions are mostly based on visual perceptions from bottom-up processes, while
deliberate first impressions are based on top-down processes. In comparison, top-down
visual stimuli processing is influenced by conscious reasoning and reflective cognitive
processes (Thielsch et al., 2014).

2.4.1 Impact of first impressions
The impact of first impressions within HCI has been researched, for instance, regarding
visual appeal and perception of usability (Tractinsky, Cokhavi, Kirschenbaum, & Sharfi,
2006), trust (Karvonen, Cardholm, & Karlsson, 2000), and credibility (Robins & Holmes,
2008). Regarding judgment and decision-making, first impressions can cause cognitive
confirmation bias. In a situation of cognitive confirmation bias, the user's positive first
16

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

impression can influence the perception of negative issues, suggesting that the user may
overlook issues and errors later on encountered. The confirmation bias also affects
perceptions in situations of negative first impressions. Users with negative first
impressions often have a more challenging time accepting positive aspects later on,
diminishing positive perceptions of appeal, usability, and content (Sheng et al., 2013).
The impact of confirmation bias and first impressions can, especially in the setting of web
page viewing, be imperative to understand to attain the user's attention and willingness to
revisit a web page. The cognitive confirmation bias has also been determined to have a
sustained effect on the user, further demonstrating that first impressions can have longlasting effects.
Since first impressions can have long-lasting effects, it is therefore vital to consider what
kind of first impressions web pages generate. Research has proven that participants
ranked perceived usability higher when the first impression based on visual appeal was
positive. Conversely, participants ranked perceived usability lower when the first
impression of visual appeal was negative, even though the usability was higher
(Lindgaard et al., 2006). The exhibited phenomenon is a form of a cognitive bias called
the halo effect, proving that first impressions have long-lasting effects and influence the
user's perception of usability, credibility, and trust (Djamasbi et al., 2011). Because of the
halo-effect, a first impression affects everything the user sees and processes afterward,
meaning that great content and usability might not have an impact if the user has already
formed a negative or positive first impression (Lindgaard et al., 2006).

2.5 Prior research in the field of first impressions
Majority of first impressions research within the field of HCI focus on the impact of visual
appeal and aesthetics on the formation of first impressions. Research observing the effect
on trust, credibility, informativeness, task performance, mental workload, and perceived
usability have been conducted, as well as research on cultural effects, gender differences,
and the behavior of different generation (Tuch et al., 2012). However, a common goal has
been to understand better what kind of elements and factors generate specific user
judgments. Fundamental research has, for instance, been made by Lindgaard et al. (2006),
17

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

their research confirming that first impressions of web pages are constructed rapidly
within milliseconds of exposure. Researchers have been inspired by Lindgaard et al.'s
studies and have provided further proof of the initial study's findings.

2.5.1 Exposure time
Lindgaard et al. (2006) conducted three studies to determine the time frame of forming
an impression based on a web page’s visual appeal. Participants viewed and rated the
visual appeal of web pages that were generally rated as the “best and worst examples of
visually appealing web pages by members of the Human Oriented Technology Lab”
(Lindgaard et al., 2006). Exposure times were limited to 500 milliseconds and 50
milliseconds. Results were highly correlated, concluding that 50 milliseconds is enough
time for a user to form a reliable first impression based on its visual appeal.
Tractinsky et al.’s (2006) research concluded that users can form immediate impressions
based on aesthetics and that these impressions are substantial. The study’s objective was
to provide further proof for the rapid pace of formation and the effect that aesthetics has
on first impressions. As opposed to Lindgaard et al.’s (2006) research, Tractinsky et al.
(2006) conducted two experiments with an exposure time of 500 milliseconds and a
longer exposure time to ensure the consistency of the formed opinion. Evaluations were
consistent between the shorter 500 millisecond exposure time and the longer exposure
time of 10 seconds, further supporting the evidence that reliable opinions are formed
already within milliseconds.

2.5.2 Judgments based on aesthetics
In research conducted after the initial study, the aim for Lindgaard, Litwinska, and
Dudek's (2008) esearch, was to identify visual attributes that affect judgments as well as
review how relationships between judgments of visual appeal, trust, and usability, differ
in terms of different cognitive demands. To further confirm findings from previous work,
the exposure time was limited to 50 milliseconds. The results revealed that judgments on
18

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

appeal formed significantly faster than judgments on trust and usability. All three
judgments were driven by visual appeal, even though perceptions of usability and
trustworthiness are differently processed since they are cognitively more demanding than
perceptions of appeal. The same study also aimed to determine if specific attributes or
combinations of attributes could potentially influence perceptions of appeal, trust, and
usability judgments. Six attributes were tested individually for each of the three
judgments. The chosen attributes were: balance, contrast, density, graphics, symmetry,
and text. The results revealed that density, contrast, and graphics had the best impact on
appeal ratings. Whereas balance, text, and contrast were prominent when it came to
trustworthiness. Lastly, graphics, balance, and contrast were determined to considerably
impact usability ratings (Lindgaard et al., 2008).
In research conducted by Tractinsky et al. (2006), the results exhibited that extreme
ratings on attractiveness, both positive and negative, were provided faster than average
ratings. Users evaluated web pages based on classical and expressive aesthetics design
dimensions. Classical aesthetics describes the design's clarity and orderliness, and
expressive aesthetics represents the creativity, originality, and richness of the web page's
design. Results revealed that positive impressions were, in general, combined with high
levels of both classical and expressive aesthetic dimensions. Furthermore, web pages that
were categorized as unattractive by users mainly had lower levels of expressive aesthetics
(Tractinsky et al., 2006).

2.5.3 Credibility and trust
In Albert, Gribbons, and Almada’s (2009) study, the aim was to research trust and the
impact that pre-conscious assessment has on it, as well as if these pre-conscious trust
assessments are reliable. Two trials studied the reliability of the user's trust judgments. In
the trials, screenshots of web pages were viewed for 50 milliseconds, further supporting
Lindgaard et al.’s (2006) suggestions that judgments are made rapidly within
milliseconds. Throughout the two trials, half of the participants were consistent with their
expressed judgments on trust. The results suggested that users are able to process the

19

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

feeling of trust already pre-attentively, thus concluding that the visual appeal of a web
page is also pre-attentively processed (Albert et al., 2009).
Kim and Fesenmaier (2008) researched the impact that first impressions have on
destination web pages' persuasiveness. Results concluded usability and inspiration as
primary drivers for positive first-impression formation; the results also indicated that
participants make rapid judgments in the context of tourism web pages. The study's
chosen determining factors were informativeness, usability, credibility, inspiration,
involvement, and reciprocity. Kim and Fesenmaier (2008) determined these factors as
considerable elements regarding the formation of first impressions regarding tourism
destination web pages. However, credibility, inspiration, involvement, and reciprocity
were confirmed not to be perceived as favorable by the users. In the formation of first
impressions, inspiration-related elements had the most impact, whereas usability and
credibility were determined as the following drivers. The results obtained from the
research further supporting the general findings regarding first impressions; visual appeal
and aesthetics have a significant impact on the formation of first impressions (Kim &
Fesenmaier, 2008).
Robins and Holmes (2008) studied the relationship between visual design and credibility.
In the study, web pages were designed with high and low aesthetic treatments to
determine visual aesthetics' effect on credibility. Web pages with high aesthetic
treatments were consciously designed, employing design principles for effective
communication, mindful use of colors and graphics to enhance the brand and overall
concept. For web pages with low aesthetic treatment, content and design elements were
placed without any considerations of making it visually appealing. Web pages with high
aesthetic treatment produced more positive judgments of credibility, further supporting
the hypothesis that a web page's visual design has a significant impact on the user's
perception.
The study focused on the visceral level of experience. A noteworthy aspect of the visceral
level is that there has not been any cognitive reflection. In other words, the visceral
experience is the immediate reaction. Robins and Holmes' (2008) findings demonstrated
that shorter exposure times resulted in more negative credibility judgments. The longer
20

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

the exposure time, the more positive the judgment of credibility tended to be. The results
imply that judgments are based on cognitive criteria. Robins and Holmes (2008)
concluded that establishing credibility through content is more challenging if a positive
judgment of credibility has not already been made at the visceral level.

2.5.4 Visual complexity and prototypicality
Michailidou et al.’s (2008) research presented results regarding first impressions, visual
complexity, and the perceived aesthetics of web pages. Visual complexity is defined as
the extent to which detail is contained in an image or an interface (Tuch et al., 2012). The
level of complexity is determined by structural elements and the characteristics of these
structural elements. Texts, links, images, and tables are categorized as structural elements.
The color and size of these elements are regarded as possible characteristics. Visual
complexity is dependent on “the density and the diversity of the elements” (Tractinsky et
al., 2006). Density is the number of structural elements on the web page, whereas
diversity is the variety of different structural elements placed in the interface (Michailidou
et al., 2008). In other words, visual complexity is constructed by the arrangement of
objects, symmetry, variety of colors, and the openness in the interface.
The study conducted by Michailidou et al. (2008) takes into consideration that
impressions of web pages are formed rapidly and that these impressions are the first
impressions of the user. However, contrary to other already mentioned research, in
Michailidou et al.’s (2008) study, the exposure time was not fixed. The results determined
a strong and high correlation between perceived visual complexity, aesthetic appearance,
and structural elements. In its entirety, the study demonstrates that it is possible to
manipulate user perception with structural changes in the layout of the web page. The
results exhibit that the overall structural layout is an essential possibility in predicting the
user’s impression (Michailidou et al., 2008).
Tuch et al. (2012) also researched the contribution of visual complexity and
prototypicality of web pages regarding first impressions. Prototypicality is created from
the user’s mental models that arise through experience. Prototypicality is, in a way, the
21

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

expectation the user has of the placement of objects on the web page. The main findings
in Tuch et al.’s (2012) research were that visual complexity and prototypicality of web
pages are essential elements regarding first impressions of aesthetic perceptions. The
study’s results revealed that web pages with high visual complexity resulted in more
negative first impressions. However, web pages with higher prototypicality levels created
more positive first impressions than web pages that had lower levels of prototypicality.
Negative first impressions were the highest with web pages with a high level of visual
complexity and low prototypicality level. Web pages with low visual complexity and high
prototypicality were considered visually appealing, concluding that the level of visual
complexity has a more substantial impact on web pages with high prototypicality (Tuch
et al., 2012). Beyond the effects of prototypicality and visual complexity, the researchers
also found that users were quick to respond in cases of web pages that were considered
attractive than with web pages that were deemed to be unattractive. The results from Tuch
et al.’s (2012) research highlight the importance of considering visual complexity and the
level of prototypicality, as well as how these two factors play together when designing
web pages.

2.5.5 Mode of use
Van Schaik and Ling (2009) expanded Lindgaard et al.’s (2006) research studying the
mode of use. The user’s prevailing situation defines the mode of use. The mode of use
can be either action or goal-oriented. In the goal-oriented mode of use, the user focuses
on accomplishing a goal, and the system functions as an aid to complete that goal.
Whereas in action mode, the user focuses on specific actions. Different modes of use are
subconsciously combined with distinct preferences. Users with goal mode generally
prefer web pages with classical aesthetics since the arousal is low, and the design is clear
and familiar. Web pages with classical aesthetics favor sensemaking, and the
understanding of the content is, in general, more comfortable. Users in action mode prefer
expressive aesthetics since it generates higher arousal levels with its complexity (Van
Schaik & Ling, 2009).

22

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

The mode of use is considered to be a pivotal factor when it comes to the stability of
created impressions. Van Schaik and Ling’s (2009) study demonstrated that the
perception of aesthetics was more stable when a context was provided, entailing that
including a mode of use form more reliable perceptions. The reason for this is that when
the user is provided with a context, the user is more likely to have a focus for its judgment
of the potential use, thus “producing less volatile judgements” (Van Schaik & Ling,
2009). In conclusion, Van Schaik and Ling (2009) demonstrated that the mode of use,
type of aesthetic design, and the knowledge the user possesses are essential factors to
consider in perception formation.

2.5.6 Influencing elements
Thielsch et al. 's (2014) research aimed to understand the user’s process of evaluating a
web page and the influencing elements. The study examined content, usability, and
aesthetics as influencing elements. Since content, usability, and aesthetics are expressed
by the objects placed in the user interface, they play a notable role in cognitive processing
and the visual perception of a web page. In the process of evaluating web pages Thielsch
et al. (2014) distinguished three phases of web page use: the phase for exposure and
impression formation, the evaluation and use phase, and an intentional outcomes phase.
The study further differentiated first impressions as immediate or deliberate. Deliberate
impressions are constructed from reflective cognitive processes and reasoning, whereas
immediate impressions are predominantly based on aesthetics alone.
The study’s general results were that all three, content, usability, and aesthetics,
contributed to the formation of first- and overall impression of a web page (Thielsch et
al., 2014). In the deliberate first impression formation phase, aesthetics had a significant
impact, whereas content had a moderate impact. In the intentional outcome phase, the
extent to which the user had the intention to revisit or recommend the web page, content
had a very high impact, “while aesthetics had a small but significant impact” (Thielsch et
al., 2014). Usability had no relevancy when it came to the intention to revisit or
recommend a webpage and only a “small to mediocre influence on first and overall
impressions” (Thielsch et al., 2014). The findings in Thielsch et al. 's (2014) research

23

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

suggest that also for deliberate first impressions, aesthetics is a decisive factor. However,
for the whole duration of use, content is a significant factor. In higher cognitive processes,
in cases such as deciding if the web page is worth revisiting, the influence of content
increases while the impact of aesthetics decreases; however, it is not eliminated.
Douneva et al. (2016) research studied how different web page designs influence first
impressions. For the study, company web pages were separated into different categories
identified through their salient characteristics. The study’s objective was to investigate
differences in first impressions, visual aesthetics evaluations, and the web pages’
memorability. Through that determining which web page designs, users were most
inclined to favor. The chosen web pages were categorized as follows (Douneva et al.,
2016):
1. Strong colors of one color family (SCOFA)
2. Large pictures (LAPIC)
3. The same amount of pictures and text (SAPAT)
The main findings regarding aesthetic preferences were that pages with an equal amount
of pictures and text (SAPAT) were assessed as professional and conventional. In contrast,
strong colored pages (SCOFA) were found to be less professional. Strong colored pages
were also determined as unimaginative and uninviting. Pages with large pictures (LAPIC)
were evaluated between SAPAT and SCOFA pages, being perceived as conventional but
not to the same extent as SAPAT pages. Regarding memory performance, pages with the
same amount of pictures and text generated the best results; however, both pages with
large pictures and pages with strong colors generated results close to the average.
The results can be explained by the prototypicality of the presented web pages. Most of
the pages in all categories had a high prototypicality, meaning that objects such as menus
and search bars are placed in places that the user expects to find them. Even with shorter
exposure times, web page designs that meet users’ expectations are more likely to be
remembered (Douneva et al., 2016). Based on the research results, web pages with an
equal amount of text and pictures are perceived as aesthetically more appealing, resulting
in high memory performances.

24

2.6 Impact of visual stimulus, appeal, and aesthetics
on first impressions
Lindgaard et al. (2006) argued that first impressions, especially in an HCI environment,
build and depend on aesthetics and visual complexity. The preference for visually
appealing objects is evident when it comes to product choices; the same preference exists
for system interfaces and web pages. According to Lindgaard et al.'s (2008) study,
perceived visual attractiveness accounted for 72% of the overall user experience and
usability. Users were found to perceive visually appealing systems as more usable than
less appealing versions.
Most of the prior studies have primarily stated their definition of visual appeal and
aesthetics. Definitions vary, still, all come down to the same principle that the perception
of visual appeal and aesthetics is subjective. Visual appeal, aesthetics, and beauty are
often used synonymously. Thielsch et al. (2014) defined aesthetics as a pleasurable
personal experience of an object. Lindgaard et al. (2006) approached aesthetics as a part
of visual appeal, concluding that aesthetics is an undefined subjective term about beauty,
agreeing with earlier research that aesthetics can be divided into two dimensions, classical
and expressive. Classical aesthetics refers to design concepts such as symmetry,
orderliness, cleanness, and pleasantness, whereas expressive aesthetics refer to
perceptions of originality, creativity, and fascination. The evaluation of classical and
expressive aesthetics is considered to be subjective; however, according to Tractinsky et
al. (2006) they still describe a general notion of aesthetics that is consensual.

2.6.1 Assessment of visual appeal and aesthetics
Tuch et al. (2012) argued that aesthetic judgments are formed by the perceived stimuli,
such as color, shape, and complexity of the objects and the interface. Previous experience
and knowledge influence how the stimulus is perceived. The perceived aesthetics is
processed in five different stages (Tuch et al., 2012). First, a perceptual analysis is made,
followed by an implicit memory integration; these first stages are processed
subconsciously and are thus intuitive. The following stages, three and four, are influenced
25

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

by knowledge and previous experiences, implementing higher cognitive processes. At the
final stage, all of the processed information is evaluated. From the final process, two
outputs have been suggested, "aesthetic appraisal and aesthetic judgment" (Tuch et al.,
2012). Aesthetic appraisals are what most web page designers hope to achieve since
appraisals are positively valued perceptions, while aesthetic judgments are negatively
connotated judgments (Tuch et al., 2012).
Lindgaard et al. (2008) studied the attributes balance, contrast, density, graphics,
symmetry, and text, to determine if specific attributes would generate higher ratings of
appeal, trustworthiness, or perceived usability. Thielsch et al. (2014) attempted to
measure aesthetics with a series of questions presented in a questionnaire. Four aspects
were examined; simplicity, diversity, color, and craftsmanship. Of these four aspects, 18
items were measured to find a general aesthetic factor. Tractinsky et al. (2006) had
participants evaluating web pages on a 10-point rating scale; the intention was to figure
out the user's level of agreement with the web page's design. Statements on expressive
aesthetics, such as sophistication, creativeness, and fascination, as well as classical
aesthetics statements such as cleanliness, pleasantness, and aesthetics, were studied.
Michailidou et al. (2008) highlighted that visual design could alter users' perceptions of
web pages with color modifications, used fonts and size, and images and animations.
Their research examined evaluations from a classical and an expressive point of view.
Five terms and their antonyms were used to evaluate web pages: (1) cluttered – clean, (2)
boring – intense, (3) disorganized – organized, (4) confusing – clear, and (5) ugly –
beautiful (Michailidou et al., 2008).

2.6.2 Practical implications of visual stimulus on first
impressions
First impressions are defined differently depending on how much time the user spends on
forming it. In terms of pre-use first impressions, the user has not had any time to process
what it has seen cognitively, meaning that the impression is based solely on a
subconscious impression derived from the visual stimulus. Visual information is

26

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

predominantly responsible for pre-use first impressions since visual stimulus is evaluated
immediately (Thielsch et al., 2014). In HCI, the visual stimulus is constructed of design
elements, graphical objects, and images placed in the GUI. Since pre-use first impressions
are formed within milliseconds, based on visual stimulus, the user’s viewing behavior is
an essential part of the impression formation. The user’s viewing behavior determines the
gaze pattern, most importantly determining where the gaze falls during these first
impactful milliseconds. The user’s viewing pattern can be altered by visual design
elements, meaning that visual design elements also influence first impressions. According
to Buscher et al. (2009), an element’s saliency directs the user’s first fixations. Following
fixations are guided by the user’s expectation and the knowledge of where to find specific
content. In conclusion, the user’s viewing behavior is governed by three different aspects:
1. The features of the web page itself.
2. The users’ expectations of where to find relevant information.
3. The users’ underlying task or need for information.
Especially in an authorless environment like the world wide web, visual design’s impact
serves a function beyond decoration (Robins & Holmes, 2008). Lindgaard et al. (2006)
demonstrated that first impression judgments are considerably stable; new information is
often processed in a biased way influenced by the initial impression. The opposing
evidence from additional attributes such as usability, functionality, and reliability has to
be significant in order for the impression to change (Tractinsky et al., 2006). Implying
that positive judgments of credibility already need to be made at a visceral level since it
is more challenging to establish credibility through authority or content, let alone
convincing the user if a negative impression already has been formed.
Research has proven that prototypicality significantly impacts how users judge appeal
and aesthetics (Tuch et al., 2012). As mentioned earlier, prototypicality represents the
user’s expectations of how objects are placed on a web page or system. Elements such as
navigation bars and logos are usually found in similar places regardless of the web page.
Michailidou et al. (2008) concluded that a high level of familiarity impacts the user’s
perception of appeal and impression. Correspondingly, Tuch et al.’s (2012) study
demonstrated that a high prototypicality creates positive first impressions. Contradicting
27

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

web page designs that differ significantly from users’ expectations can lead to suboptimal
first impressions. Familiar environments and designs are generally perceived as more
attractive and user-friendly than unfamiliar ones (Tuch et al., 2012). While new and
creative solutions could seem like great possibilities to make positive impressions, users
still perceive familiar and recognizable web pages as more appealing than unfamiliar
modern solutions.

3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The following chapter will present the research methodology as well as the design and
the procedure of the conducted study. The chapter will include a justification for the
chosen method alongside a description of qualitative and quantitative methods in general
and suggestions of alternative approaches. The research methodology serves as a guide
for the conducted study and for the decisions that have been made.

3.1 Methodology selection
According to Nyberg and Tidström (2012), the selection of research method should be
based on the research questions and what kind of a problem the researchers aim to solve.
Qualitative methods are considered well-fitted when the objective of the research is to
understand attitudes, experiences, and behavior in-depth. In contrast, quantitative
methods generate statistics from larger groups of participants through more time-efficient
methods, such as questionnaires or structured interviews (Dawson, 2011). Qualitative and
quantitative approaches are differentiated through the type of questions that are asked,
through expected answers, and used variables (Nyberg & Tidström, 2012).
Quantitative approaches typically aim to answer questions regarding frequency, quantity,
relationships, or connections. Answers are mainly provided in manners that can be
measured or placed on a scale for statistical processing or calculation purposes (Nyberg
& Tidström, 2012). Thus, providing opportunities for obtaining large scale insights and
statistical data on relationships, connections, and general perceptions. In quantitative
research, the method must be reliable in order for the results to be valid. The method used
should be tested and verified for the minimal occurrence of invalid data and confusion
from the participant (Nyberg & Tidström, 2012).
Qualitative research methods aspire to interpret and understand phenomena, who, why,
what, and how are typical question. In contrary to quantitative approaches, questions in
qualitative studies are seldomly answered with numbers. In qualitative studies, free
formulating answers are often included, and responses are divided into categories or
29

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

classes rather than frequencies or quantities (Nyberg & Tidström, 2012). Qualitative
approaches are traditionally more time-consuming, often having participants formulating
their own answers and going more in-depth with the obtained responses. Since qualitative
methods require more time and more resources, the samples are usually smaller.
However, with smaller samples, it is challenging to make sweeping statements (Nyberg
& Tidström, 2012).

3.2 Chosen method
The study aims to investigate how visually salient elements influence pre-use first
impression perceptions of visual appeal, trustworthiness, overall impressions, and further
use. Previous research within first impressions has mostly used quantitative approaches
or combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on previous studies and
the presented research question, a quantitative approach was chosen. A qualitative
approach could contribute in-depth insight into how users perceive web pages with
different salient elements, thus, offering explicit improvements to web page design.
However, according to Tractinsky et al. (2006), web page designers do not design for
individuals. Designers design for populations, thus highlighting the importance of
obtaining judgments from larger samples rather than individuals.
Since the study aims to explore the user’s pre-use first impression perceptions, the
exposure time is a contributing factor in choosing the approach. Pre-use first impressions
are formed within milliseconds of exposure, based solely on visual stimulus (Thielsch et
al., 2014). Because of the short exposure time, it might be challenging for the participants
to express their opinions and emotions, suggesting to include simple answer options. In a
setting where the participant freely formulates its answer, the answer’s reliability
becomes a factor since the perception might change during the process.
A user forms its perception based on visual stimulus and prior knowledge. In order to
avoid a situation that the participant would have previous experience or obtained
perception of an existing web page, new web pages without any connection to existing
web pages or brands have to be used. Prior knowledge or an already formed perception
30

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

even of a company name could lead to differences in results. A first impression is only
formed once, meaning that the perceived first impression influences any judgments made
after the initial exposure. Additionally, pre-use first impressions occur before the user has
had any time to interact with the web page, suggesting that participants should not be able
to explore the web page at all before providing their opinions. Previous studies have used
screenshots of web pages instead of active web pages to ensure the the answers’
reliability.

3.2.1 Alternative methods
Eye-tracking methods have been widely used in first impression studies, especially
regarding influencing visual elements and general viewing behavior. Eye-tracking
methods generate accurate evidence on eye movements and longer fixations, making it
easier to determine where attention subconsciously is drawn and what kind of elements
attract the most attention in which settings. However, even though eye-tracking studies
provide visible evidence, it does not necessarily always present the whole truth in how
the user perceives what has been seen. Sutcliffe and Namoune (2008) demonstrated that
eye-tracking devices provide data on areas and elements that can be considered salient.
However, these areas might ultimately be utterly uninteresting to the user itself, thus not
being as impactful as deemed. Since eye-tracking tests point out areas that are by default
salient but not necessarily interesting for the users, Sutcliffe and Namoune (2008) suggest
that a post-test memory recall of the web page content is a sufficient way to test the
saliency of areas.
An eye-tracking method would provide the study confirmation of salient elements and
regions and provide insight into how these elements influence general eye-movements
and fixations. However, results obtained from eye-tracking studies do not convey how
the user perceives the visual appeal, the web page’s trustworthiness, or the user’s overall
impression. Combining an eye-tracking study and a questionnaire could be a possible
approach that would generate both evidence on saliency as well as convey the user’s
perceptions and judgments. Nevertheless, the option would be more time-consuming for
the participants and those conducting the study, resulting in a smaller sample. Therefore
31

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

the author opted for a simple and more approachable option that would generate a larger
sample.

3.3 Application of method
An online survey was chosen to be the best procedure to obtain valid results and reach
out to as many participants as possible. An online survey offers several
advantages, i.e., participants can be reached quickly, effortlessly, and respond to the
survey more time-efficiently. A survey answered online also allows the participant to
complete the survey wherever and whenever. It does not contribute to the same kind of
pressure and possibly objective answers as an observed experiment. For researchers, an
online survey increases the capacity for a larger sample, and the obtained responses can
be transmitted straight to databases, facilitating the researcher's work.
In order to conduct an online survey successfully, the chosen tool needs to be accessible
and trustworthy enough for the participant to feel comfortable to complete the survey.
The survey should be short and straightforward and preferably offer some incentive for
the participant. Even though online surveys provide plenty of advantages, as to
everything, some weaknesses are essential to keep in mind when analyzing the data. There
is no guarantee that the participant has answered the survey truthfully or correctly, hence
why it is imperative to formulate the entire survey, including questions and instructions,
clearly and understandably.

3.3.1 Question design
In order to acquire users’ judgments and perceptions, four different questions, following
the research questions, were formulated for the survey. Each question, focusing on one
of the four aspects of perception the study aims to answer; appeal, trustworthiness, overall
impression, and further use.

32

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

The following questions were formulated:
1. How appealing did you find the web page? (unappealing – appealing)
2. How trustworthy did you find the web page? (untrustworthy – trustworthy)
3. What kind of impression do you have of the web page? (negative – positive)
4. Would you continue to explore the web page further? (yes, no, or I don’t know)
The presented questions were answered on a 5-point scale (see figure 2). Determined that
the use of a 7-point or 10-point scale would lead to extended periods of consideration for
the participant, furthermore leading to unreliable answers as the participant takes a longer
time to process the response. On the 5-point scale, in every question, option one
represented the negative antonym of option five. For the fourth question, options “yes”,
“no”, or “I don’t know” were provided. Questions were kept similar and short to obtain
quick and genuine answers from the participants.

Figure 2: Survey question design

3.3.2 Stimuli design
For the purpose of the study, fictional web pages were created based on the stimuli
guidelines presented in Still’s (2018) study. The study included five different fictional
web pages, each web page designed to highlight one element from Faraday’s (2000)
proposed hierarchy. The feature motion from the proposed visual hierarchy was excluded
from the survey due to the choice to use screenshots of web pages instead of actual active
web pages. The designs were simple, attempting to include only one clear entry point.
Still (2018) argued that contrast and neighborhood similarity are fundamental variables
when it comes to determining saliency. In order for an object such as an image to become
33

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

salient, it “must be distinct from its neighbors” (Still, 2018). Even though saliency cannot
be guaranteed, it is essential to avoid competition with other elements higher up in the
hierarchy (Still, 2018).
For the survey, six fictional web pages were created using templates from the website
builder tool Wix.com. One web page for each visual hierarchy element; size, image, color,
text-style, and position, and an additional from this point known as no hierarchy. In order
to compare the effect of visually salient items, the no hierarchy web page was created
without a clear hierarchy and any distinguishable salient items. The chosen web page
templates were altered to fit the needs and the requirements of each stimulus set.
Templates were chosen from existing categories such as business, store, creative, and
blog, providing diversity between the stimuli. The templates were chosen based on the
features that fitted the need the best without having to strip down the template of all
included components. However, colors, fonts, images, background images, and texts were
modified. The aim was to design the web pages to look as authentic as possible, including
logos, fictional company names, social media tags, as well as relevant content that could
be associated and presented in real-life situations. However, keeping in mind not to make
the features purposely attention-drawing or more salient than the proposed highlighted
element.

3.3.3 Size stimulus
According to Faraday (2000), larger elements are more prone to be noticed over smaller
elements. More extensive features attract more attention as well as are perceived as
visually more important than smaller ones. Attention is generally first drawn to the largest
element, thus perceived as more important (Faraday, 2000). For the size stimulus, Still
(2018) determined that the largest object on the web page should be either a block of text
or an image, complying that the element is clearly distinguished from its neighbors.
For the size stimulus, the web page was constructed of an image that was significantly
larger than the rest of the elements — clearly distinguished from the objects in proximity,
appointing the image as the most visually salient item (see figure 3). Texts, links, log-in
34

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

functions, and call-to-action buttons were included for the web page to seem credible and
perceived as a web page for an existing company. However, assuring that the elements
included would not be perceived as visually more salient than the image.

Figure 3: Size stimulus

3.3.4 Image stimulus
Faraday (2000) argued that images are preferred over text, placing images after size in
the visual hierarchy. Graphics can be applied to attract attention to specific target areas
since users will first pick out information from graphics and only after that from more
demanding mediums, such as text (Faraday, 2000). Still (2018) created the image
stimulus by including an image and surrounding it with text. For this study, the size
stimulus was designed similarly, placing an image in the middle of the web page and
surrounding the image with text blocks representing blog posts (see figure 4). Design
elements commonly affiliated with blogs, such as viewing numbers, links to comments,
and social media buttons, were included. The applied colors were subtle in order not to
attract attention.
35

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Figure 4: Image stimulus

3.3.5 Color stimulus
Color variations are often used to highlight important objects or areas. When objects are
similar in size and appearance, bright colors will attract more attention than heavier ones,
brighter colors dominating over darker (Faraday, 2000). Differences in color and contrast
provide the user visual search cues, clear contrasts exhibiting relationships between
objects, highlighting the important objects. To use color as a visually salient element, Still
(2018) proposed using only one color and presenting it as a colored text. The created
stimulus for color was kept simple, highlighting the headline with a colored text and using
that same color cohesively in the logo and navigation bar. Furthermore, to make the web
page appear authentic, social media icons were included, as well as a logo and a
navigation bar (see figure 5).

36

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Figure 5: Color stimulus

3.3.6 Text-style stimulus
Different text-styles, such as using different fonts and type formats, can be used to attract
attention and highlight meaningful words or texts (Faraday, 2000). The typeface
personality signifies the font size, weight, underlining, and italics; it provides the user
with nonverbal cues of the text. Such as how underlined links in blue often signify
hyperlinks. Still (2018) suggested manipulating a block of text, i.e., using italics or having
the text bolded to emphasize text-style. For this study, a short text-block was underlined
and bolded (see figure 6). A call-to-action button, log-in icon, and the logo were kept on
the web page, along with another short block of text. Additionally, a background fitted
for the theme was added but subdued with a low opacity.

37

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Figure 6: Text-style stimulus

3.3.7 Position stimulus
According to Faraday (2000), objects’ placement will guide the entry point if a distinction
has not already been made by size, image, color, and text-style. The user will exhibit a
top-left bias, directing its attention to the left, where reading begins. However, if no text
is present, the center will most likely be dominant. Eventually, users will “favor elements
at the top and left of the page” (Faraday, 2000).
Still (2018) created the position stimulus with a block of text positioned on the web page’s
upper part. Influenced by Still’s study, the designed position stimulus included a text
block in the upper middle part of the web page (see figure 7). An image was placed in the
lower part of the web page in order for the stimulus to look more authentic. Additionally,
a logo and navigation bar was included, as well as a call-to-action button to maintain
credibility and prototypicality.

38

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Figure 7: Position stimulus

3.3.8 No hierarchy stimulus
The purpose of the additional stimulus, no hierarchy, was to include a web page stimulus
that did not have an apparent visual hierarchy or prominent visually salient elements.
Visual displays without significantly salient objects are categorized as conjunction
targets. Any visual stimulus will contain elements that the brain assesses as somewhat
salient, and the gaze will initially fall on that object or region. However, since conjunction
targets lack significantly salient objects, it causes the user to scan the display aimlessly
in order to find these non-significant salient objects or regions (Treisman & Gelade,
1980). The aimless scanning can leave the user feeling frustrated or confused, leading to
a negative perception of the viewed stimulus.
For the study, the web page was designed to display a high prototypicality; however,
contrary to the other created web pages, without a clear entry point. The stimulus
contained several similar attention-drawing objects without an evident contrast that would
indicate specific objects to be significantly salient (see figure 8). Additionally, all the
39

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

placed design elements were similar in size, form, and positioning, forming an inadequate
visual hierarchy. In order to create an operating visual hierarchy, the elements in the entry
point's proximity should vary in such a degree that the elements guide the user to the next
essential region.

Figure 8: No hierarchy stimulus

3.4 Survey design
The survey for the study was constructed with the online survey tool Typeform. The tool
was chosen because of its versatility, features, and simplicity. The survey consisted of
two parts: the demographic questions and stimuli exposure. The demographic questions
asked for information such as year of birth, gender, and education. For clarity, the year of
birth was asked rather than age. Since individuals who are color-blind might perceive the
effect of color differently, a question was included asking whether or not the participant
is color-blind. The second part of the survey involved the created web page stimuli, each
stimulus presented and followed by the formulated survey questions.

40

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

The web page stimuli were presented for all participants in the following randomized
order:
1. Text-style
2. Image
3. No hierarchy
4. Color
5. Size
6. Position

3.4.1 Tool restrictions and solutions
Several different survey tools were considered, however, discharged due to a lack of
desirable features. Even the chosen survey tool lacked a few desirable features, such as a
timing feature. A timing feature would have made it possible to restrict the exposure time
and assured that the stimulus would only be seen once. Since the survey aims to explore
pre-use first impressions, a specified exposure time had to be included. The issue was
solved by presenting the web page stimuli in separate video clips. Thus, controlling the
exposure time and incorporating a neutral screen both before and after the exposure time
for a more concentrated observation. A limitation with this solution was that the
participant could accidentally or intentionally see the stimuli multiple times; however,
clear instructions were given to see the video clip only once. The constructed video clips
consisted of seven seconds of a black screen, followed by the web page stimulus for four
seconds, finishing with a black screen an additional four seconds. Each video clip lasted
14 seconds in total. The clips were assembled in the Apple Inc. software iMovie and
uploaded onto the video hosting and sharing platform Vimeo, and from there embedded
into the survey.
In order to obtain comparable data resembling real web page viewing, participants were
urged to use desktop computers or laptops and view the video clips containing the stimuli
in full screen. Based on previous research, the exposure time was limited to four seconds.
Since the chosen exposure time was short, a test round was included to minimize the
41

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

effect of possible confusion for the first stimulus, as well as for the results to be equal,
regardless of the order of the video clips. Participants were made aware that the first round
was a test round to minimize stress.

3.4.2 Data collection
The formulated survey was published on June 8, 2020, and open for 16 days until June
24, 2020. No specific audiences were targeted; however, a sample diverse in age and
gender was desired. The only prerequisite presented at the start of the survey was that the
survey would be done on a computer desktop or a laptop.
The survey was shared at the communication channel Yammer for Åbo Akademi
University, accessible for all students and all of the university faculty. Additionally, the
survey was shared on social media platforms such as Facebook and directly to the author's
friends and acquaintances. The survey was promoted to be quick and different, only
taking 5 – 10 minutes to complete. The participants were urged to send an email to the
author if they had any questions or wished to know more about the research. Results from
47 participants were recorded and analyzed; the obtained results are presented in chapter
four.

4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The following chapter presents and summarizes the obtained results from the conducted
study. First, an analysis of the descriptive information is provided, followed by the
quantitative data analysis results from repeated measures ANOVA's and one-way
ANOVA's.

4.1 Descriptive analysis
Four demographic questions were included at the beginning of the survey: gender, year
of birth, education, and whether the participant is color-blind. The obtained information
was summarized in the survey tool Typeform as well as processed in Microsoft Excel for
better readability. A total of 47 participants responded to the survey, of which 55% of
participants were female and 45% male. Options for education were limited to; uppersecondary, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and other. The greater part of participants,
49% had a master’s degree, 23% had a bachelor’s degree, 17 % had an upper-secondary
education, and 11 % reported their education level as other (see figure 9).

Figure 9: Distribution of education (n = 47)

43

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Year of birth was an open-ended question and based on the answers divided into four
categories; 1995 – 2000, 1994 – 1985, 1984 – 1975, 1974 – 1965, 1964 – 1954. The age
distribution is illustrated in figure 10. The 1994 – 1985 category is the largest one with
23 participants, an equivalent of 49%, followed by the 1974 – 1965 category with 9
participants.

Figure 10: Age distribution (n = 47)

Lastly, participants were asked if they are color-blind. As mentioned before, color
blindness might affect how webpages are perceived, specifically regarding the use of
color. Therefore color-blind participants had to be excluded from the analysis of the rest
of the results. Only three out of 47 participants reported color blindness and were
excluded from the results from this point on.

4.2 Quantitative data analysis
The results of 44 participants were examined. The stimuli were showed in a randomized
order from Faraday’s (2000) initially proposed hierarchy. All participants viewed the
stimuli in the following order; (1) text-style, (2) image, (3) no hierarchy, (4) color, (5)
size, (6) position. Participants rated each web page stimulus on a scale of 1 – 5 regarding
44

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

visual appeal, overall impression, and trustworthiness. For the questions regarding further
use, options “yes,” “no,” and “I don’t know” were presented.

4.2.1 Appeal ratings
For appeal ratings, the size stimulus had the highest mean value (M = 3.9), followed by
the no hierarchy stimulus (M = 3.8). The image and color stimuli both had the lowest
mean (M = 2.5), whereas the text-style stimulus (M = 3.2) and the position stimulus (M =
3.1) had average mean values (see table 1).

The text-style stimulus presented the highest standard deviation (SD = 1.10) for appeal
ratings. As seen in figure 11, the results indicate a divided opinion among the respondents.
For the position stimulus, the standard deviation is relatively high (SD = 0.98). In
comparison to the text-style stimulus, responses were evenly spread out for both the
position and the image (SD = 1.00) stimulus.

4.2.2 Trustworthiness ratings
As in the appeal ratings, size (M = 3.8) had the highest mean in trustworthiness ratings.
The standard deviation was considerably low (SD = .65), and most of the participants
seemed to agree (see figure 4). The stimulus for text-style and color received similar
responses resulting in identical mean and standard deviation values (M = 3.2, SD = .94).
All of the stimuli had considerably high means and low standard deviations compared to
the results from the other questions (see table 2).

As seen in figure 12, participants ranked the stimuli close to the average for all elements.
Hardly any participants rated the stimuli as untrustworthy (1) or trustworthy (5).
Indicating that not many participants felt like the web pages were untrustworthy, nor did
they think that the web pages were entirely trustworthy.

4.2.3 Impression ratings
Impression ratings were relatively high for all stimuli. The no hierarchy stimulus had the
highest mean (M = 3.8), followed by the size stimulus (M = 3.6). The text-style and
position stimuli had the same mean value (M = 3.5) but different standard deviations.
Text-style had SD = .98, conversely position had a lower SD =.90. The color and image
stimulus had the lowest means (M = 2.7, M = 2.8).

As seen in figure 13 and the standard deviation values (see table 3), there is a consensus
among the participants. Many participants chose the same values, resulting in lower
standard deviations, as well as average results. Only a few participants rated the stimuli
as negative or positive. None of the participants rated the impression of size, position, and
no hierarchy as negative.

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

4.2.4 Results of further use
As for all of the questions, the size and no hierarchy stimuli generated positive answers
regarding further use. Distinctly seen in figure 14, participants were most likely to explore
further the web page stimuli made for size and no hierarchy. For the size stimulus, 30
participants stated that they would continue using the web page. Correspondingly, for the
no hierarchy stimulus, 32 participants replied yes regarding further use. Participants
answered mostly yes, closely followed by no, and I don’t know for the text-style and
position stimuli. The color stimulus was the only stimulus where more participants replied
no than yes or I don’t know.

Figure 14: Distribution of further use replies

4.3 Repeated measures ANOVA
In order to discover possible statistically significant relationships, the obtained data was
processed and analyzed with the statistical tool IBM SPSS Statistics (v.26.0). Repeated
measures ANOVA’s were used to analyze relationships between designs. Bonferroni was
used as adjustment for multiple comparisons, and the level of significance was set to 𝛼 =
0.05. Mauchly’s test of sphericity was assumed if p ≥ .05.

48

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

For the appeal ratings, Mauchly’s test 𝓍 2(14) = 12.48, p = .57 did not indicate any
violation of sphericity. The differences between appeal rating means were statistically
significant: F(2, 215) = 19.44, p < .001.

Table 4: Pairwise comparisons for appeal ratings

49

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Pairwise comparisons revealed that size and image, size and color, image and no
hierarchy, as well as color and no hierarchy, were highly statistically significant with the
significance level p < .001. Size and text-style, size and position, image and text-style,
image and position, color and text-style, color and position, text-style and no hierarchy,
along with position and no hierarchy were all statistically significant, p < .05 (see table
4). The only nonsignificant pairs for appeal ratings were size and no hierarchy, image and
color, and text-style and position.
The repeated measures ANOVA results present only a few statistically nonsignificant
pairings, four highly statistically significant pairs, and the rest statistically significant.
The results for appeal ratings thus indicate that the differences in participant responses
result from differences in stimuli. Based on the results, it could be assumed that even with
a different and larger sample, the same statistically significant results would be present.
The ratings for trust did indicate a violation of sphericity, Mauchly’s test 𝑥 2 (14) = 29.32,
p = .010. As proposed by Howell (2012) and Field (2013), the Greenhouse-Geisser level
of significance p = .84 advocates the use of the Huynh-Feldt results since p > .75. The
differences between the means were statistically significant: F(4, 197.75) = 2.74, p = .028
using Huynh-Feldt results. The pairwise comparisons disclose that only the size and color
stimuli (p = .022) along with size and text-style stimuli (p = .011) are statistically
significant (see table 5).
Compared to the repeated measures ANOVA results from appeal ratings, the results from
trust ratings demonstrate a lack of statistical significance. The differences in stimuli were
only statistically significant for trust ratings when size and color, and size and text-style
were compared. The lack of statistically significant pairings indicates that differences in
participant responses are not due to differences in stimuli design.

50

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Table 5: Pairwise comparisons for trust ratings

For impression ratings Mauchly’s test 𝑥 2 (14) = 16.41, p = .29 did not indicate any
violation of sphericity. The differences between impression mean values are statistically
significant: F(2, 210) = 12.06, p < .001. The pairwise comparisons reveal that size and
image, size and color, image and text-style, image and position, image and no hierarchy,
color and text-style, color and position, color and no hierarchy are statistically significant
pairs (see table 6).
51

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

The repeated measures ANOVA for impression ratings shows that roughly half of the
pairings are statistically significant, whereas the other half of the pairings are not. The
results indicate that for statistically significant pairings, the difference in stimuli provokes
a difference in response. In contrast, for nonsignificant pairings, the response is not a
product of differences in the stimulus.

Further use ratings did not indicate any violation of sphericity with Mauchly’s test 𝑥 2 (14)
= 9.74, p = .78. The differences in means are statistically significant: F(5, 215) = 5.97, p
< .001. Size and image (p = .029), size and color (p = .013), color and no hierarchy (p
= .005) were the only pairs that were statistically significant (see table 7). The repeated
measure ANOVA for further use replies produced only three statistically significant
pairings. The results imply that the differences in replies are derived from differences in
53

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

stimulus design for the statistically significant pairings; size and image, size and color,
and color and no hierarchy. Since most pairings were statistically not significant, it could
be generally assumed that the difference in stimuli does not significantly impact further
use replies.

4.4 One-way ANOVA
One-way ANOVA’s were conducted to analyze the statistical relationships between
participants in different age groups, as well as the results from genders. In order to obtain
a better frame of reference, age groups were modified into three groups; 1991 – 2000,
1990 – 1971, 1970 – 1954 (see figure 15). Grouping the participants that are in their 20’s
in one group, participants in their 30’s and 40’s in one, and lastly participants in their 50’s
and older. For the age group, ANOVA post hoc tests were made according to Tukey,
Bonferroni, and Games-Howell. The level of significance was set to 𝛼 = 0.05, and a test
of homogeneity of variances was conducted.

Figure 15: Age distribution for updated age groups (n = 44)

For appeal ratings Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was not significant p >
.05. The one-way analysis showed that differences in year of birth had no significant
impact on ratings of appeal for size, F(2, 41) = .15, p = .86, image, F(2 , 41) = 2.74, p =
54

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

.08, color, F(2, 41) = 0.36, p = .49, text-style, F(2, 41) = .36, p = .70, position, F(2, 41) =
-83, p = .45, or no hierarchy, F(2, 41) = .28, p = .76. The results demonstrated that a
difference in age had no statistically significant impact on participants ratings. Meaning
that specific age groups did not within the group generate similar results.
For ratings on trust, Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was not significant p
> .05. Differences in the year of birth had no significant impact on size, F(2, 41) = 1.34,
p = .27, image, F(2, 40) = .11, p = .90, color, F(2, 41) = 2.54, p = .09, text-style F(2, 41)
= .08, p = .92, position, F(2, 41) = 2.04, p = .14, or no hierarchy, F(2, 41) = .92, p = .41.
The results from trust ratings indicate that a difference in age had no statistically
significant impact on any of the ratings of stimuli.
Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance for impression ratings was not significant
p > .05. Differences in the year of birth had no significant impact on the ratings for size
F(2, 40) = .01, p = .99, image F(2, 41) = 3.09, p = .06, color F(2, 41) = 2.91, p = .07, textstyle F(2, 41) = .01, p = .99, position F(2, 42) 0 .24, p = .79, or no hierarchy F(2, 41) =
.13, p = .88. As for appeal and trust ratings, there were no statistically significant
differences between age groups on impression ratings.
For replies on further use, Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was not
significant p > .05. Neither for ratings on further use did differences in the year of birth
significantly impact ratings for size, F(2, 41) = .99, p = .38, image, F(2, 41) = .19, p =
.83, color, F(2, 41) = .12, p = .88, text-style, F(2, 41) = .04, p = .97, position, F(2, 41) =
.93, p = .40, or no hierarchy, F(2, 41) = .54, p = .59. The analysis results display that for
further use replies as well, there were no statistically significant differences between age
groups. No statistically significant differences between age groups were found for appeal,
trust, or impression ratings and neither for replies on further use. The results illustrate that
the likelihood for further use, preferences in appeal, and impression generation are not
bound to age, nor are the elements that signify trust.
For significant differences in ratings as per gender, the responses of 44 participants were
analyzed, of which 43% male and 57 % female (see figure 16). For the gender one-way
ANOVA, no post hoc tests were conducted since there were only two factor-variables;
55

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

male and female. The level of significance was kept at 𝛼 = 0.05, and a test of
homogeneity of variances was conducted.
Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance for appeal ratings was not significant p >
.05. The one-way analysis revealed that the difference in gender had no significant impact
on ratings for size F(1, 42) = .29, p = .59, image, F(1, 42) = 1.80, p = .19, color, F(1, 42)
= .30, p = .59, text-style, F(1, 42) = .56, p = .41, position, F(1, 42) = .56, p = .46, or no
hierarchy, F(1, 42) = .40, p = .53. The results demonstrate that the differences between
male and female responses of appeal were not statistically significant. Meaning that the
results are not a consequence of male or female appeal preferences.

Figure 16: Distribution of female and male participants (n = 44)

For trust ratings, Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was not significant p >
.05. The gender difference did not either have a significant impact on ratings for size, F(1,
42) = .34, p = .57, image, F(1, 41) = .01, p = .92, color, F(1, 42) = .29, p = .59, text-style,
F(1, 42) = 2.02, p = 0.16, position, F(1, 42) = .43, p = .52, or no hierarchy, F(1, 42) = .58,
p = .45. As for appeal ratings, the difference between male and female trust ratings was
not statistically significant.
For impression ratings, Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was not significant
p > .05. A gender difference had no significant impact on ratings for size, F(1, 41) = .12,
p = .73, image, F(1, 42) = 1.83, p = .18, color, F(1, 42) = .10, p = .76, text-style, F(1, 42)
= 1.89, p = .18, position, F(1, 42) = .42, p = .52, or no hierarchy, F(1, 42) = 1.17, p = .29.
The results demonstrate that neither for impression ratings do gender differences have a
statistically significant impact.
56

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

For replies on further use, Levene’s statistic on homogeneity of variance was statistically
significant for size ratings p < .001, however, for image color, text-style, position, and
no hierarchy, Levene’s statistic was not significant p > .05. A difference in gender for
size replies was close to significant, F(1, 42) = 4.00, p = .05. However, for image, F(1,
42) = .09, p = .76, color, F(1, 42) = .004, p = .95, text-style, F(1, 42) = .11, p = .75,
position, F(1, 42) = .07, p = .79, and no hierarchy, F(1, 42) = .02, p = .88 a gender
difference had no significant impact. The difference in male and female responses was
not statistically significant for replies for the image, color, text-style, position, and no
hierarchy stimuli. However, for the size stimulus, a gender difference was close to
significant p = 0.05, implying that a statistically significant result could be found with a
larger sample. Meaning that for replies on further use of the size stimulus, gender could
have a statistically significant impact.

5 DISCUSSION
The following chapter will focus on the main findings from the conducted analyses
presented in the previous chapter. Main findings will be discussed as well as conclusions
derived from the discussion. Furthermore, possible practical implications, limitations, and
suggestions for further research will be presented.
This thesis aims to understand factors that influence pre-use first impressions, along with
studying how visually salient design elements influence first impressions of web pages.
In order to gain this insight, a survey was conducted with 47 respondents, from which the
answers of 44 participants were analyzed. Participants were asked to assess six fictional
web pages regarding visual appeal, trust, overall impression, and further use. The web
page stimuli: i.e., size, image, color, text-style, and position, were formed according to
Still’s (2018) guidelines of web page visual hierarchy derived initially from Faraday’s
(2000) study. A web page stimulus without any visually salient element was included in
order to observe whether web pages with visually salient elements generate higher ratings.
Even though previous research has confirmed that reliable judgments are formed within
milliseconds, the exposure time was extended to four seconds due to the study’s nature.

5.1 Main findings
In order to examine the effect that the lack of a clear entry point has, the no hierarchy
stimulus was designed not to possess a clear entry point or visual hierarchy as opposed to
the other created stimuli. The no hierarchy stimulus ratings were high in all categories;
appeal, trustworthiness, impression, and further use. The larger part of participants
responded that they would continue to explore the no hierarchy web page. As seen in the
results for the conducted repeated measures ANOVA’s, many of the no hierarchy
stimulus pairings were statistically significant for appeal, impression, further use, and
even one of the few for trust ratings. The results demonstrate that the statistically
significant differences found between the pairings are due to the differences in stimuli
design. In this study, the overall high results indicate that the absence of a clear entry
point and visual hierarchy does not lead to inferior ratings or impressions.
58

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Regarding visual appeal ratings, the stimulus for size and no hierarchy had the highest
mean values, whereas ratings for image and color had the lowest. The distribution of
ratings for each web page stimulus demonstrates that a consensus of perceived appeal
existed among the participants. Nevertheless, judgments of appeal can still be considered
subjective, as seen in the distribution of ratings for the text-style web page stimulus (see
figure 17). The text-style stimulus divided the participants roughly into two categories,
one group that perceived the web page as relatively appealing and another that perceived
the page as somewhat unappealing. The results from repeated measures ANOVA for
appeal ratings demonstrate that the statistically significant differences in ratings were due
to stimulus differences. Especially regarding the differences between the no hierarchy
stimulus and image, no hierarchy and color, as well as pairings of size and color, and size
and image, where p < .001. The highly statistically significant results indicate that
similar results should appear in other samples, regardless of size and diversity.

Figure 17: Distribution of appeal ratings for text-style stimulus

The stimulus for image and color received below-average mean values for visual appeal.
Designed according to Still’s (2018) guidelines, the web page stimulus for image
represented a blog, including an image surrounded by blocks of text (see figure 18). The
web page stimulus for color emphasized only one color and did not have any images, only
59

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

text (see figure 19). Djamasbi et al. (2010) demonstrated that users prefer web pages with
large elements and little text, offering a plausible explanation as to why the web pages
for image and color had lower mean values than the other web pages. In addition to the
user’s preference for large elements, visual complexity and prototypicality could explain
the low ratings.

Figure 18: Web page stimulus for image

According to Tuch et al. (2012), high levels of visual complexity and prototypicality lead
to negative appeal ratings. The image stimulus included several text blocks and other
structural elements, arranged in a way that is characteristic for blogs, concluding that the
image stimulus presents a high level of visual complexity as well as prototypicality.
Conversely, Tractinsky et al.’s (2006) study demonstrated that lower levels of expressive
aesthetics lead to negative appeal judgments. Expressive aesthetics indicating the level of
creativity, richness, and originality of the design, suggesting that the color stimulus
exhibits lower levels of expressive design in its simplicity and lack of different elements.

60

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

Figure 19: Web page stimulus for color

Trustworthiness ratings were high for all web page stimuli; size, no hierarchy, and
position had the highest mean values. The distribution of responses was even, again
indicating a consensus among the participants. The web pages with lower mean values
for appeal did not, contrary to predictions, have low trustworthiness ratings. Among
others, Kim and Fesenmaier (2008), and Robins and Holmes (2008) concluded that high
aesthetic treatments lead to a more positive perception of trustworthiness. Tuch et al.
(2012) argued that high prototypicality levels lead to higher perceptions of trust, implying
that appeal judgments do not dictate how trustworthy the web page is perceived as long
as it possesses a high level of prototypicality. For the repeated measures ANOVA of
trustworthiness ratings, the statistically significant pairings were size and color, and size
and text-style. Implying that for ratings of trustworthiness only in comparing size and
color, and size and text-style, the web page design elements impact the level of perceived
trustworthiness.
The stimulus for size, no hierarchy, position, and text-style had similar mean values on
ratings for overall impression. Image and color had, as in the ratings for appeal, the lowest
mean values. The text-style web page had an average mean value, indicating that the
divided appeal judgments did not affect the overall impression. The number of
statistically significant pairs in the repeated measures ANOVA were more than for

61

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

trustworthiness ratings. Statistically significant pairs were: size and image, size and color,
image and text-style, image and position, image and no hierarchy, color and text-style,
color and position, lastly, color and no hierarchy. The pairwise comparison results
indicated that the differences in design stimuli had a statistically significant impact on the
perceived impression for these pairs.
According to Thielsch et al. (2014), immediate impressions are predominantly based on
the level of aesthetics, meaning that web pages with high levels of aesthetic treatments
should generate positive impressions. However, from this study's findings, another
outcome can be determined. Web pages with below-average appeal ratings, such as image
and color, generated more negative impressions. Whereas web pages with average appeal
ratings, such as text-style, position, and web pages with above-average appeal ratings,
size, and no hierarchy, generated approximately the same level of positive impressions.
Meaning that average and above-average appeal ratings will generate a positive
impression, whereas web pages with below-average ratings generate a more negative
impression.

Figure 20: Distribution of replies for further us

The presented responses for further use were; yes, no, and I don’t know. Most participants
chose yes for size and no hierarchy, and for color, the majority chose no. For the rest of
the web pages, the responses were more evenly divided (see figure 20). Djamasbi et al.
(2011) implied that visual aesthetics is a strong predictor of the user’s willingness to
62

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

revisit a web page. Tractinsky et al. (2006) also suggested that aesthetic preferences
influence the interaction with a web page and possible outcomes. Likewise, Thielsch et
al. (2014) demonstrated that when it comes to the intentional outcome phase, e.g.,
revisiting a page or continuing exploring it, the content has the highest impact, and
aesthetics has a limited but still significant impact. The repeated measures ANOVA
conducted of further use replies resulted in three statistically significant pairings. Size and
image, size and color, and color and no hierarchy were the only statistically significant
pairings, indicating that differences in replies were not derived from differences in stimuli
for the rest of the pairings. The statistically significant pairings were the stimuli with the
highest and lowest mean values of appeal, partially supporting the conclusions made in
prior research. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that the participant’s interests
might also impact the responses of further use. The four-second exposure time can still
be enough time for the participants to apprehend what is seen and thus make conclusions
based on personal preferences of the content.
Djamasbi et al.’s (2010) study suggested that generation Y (generally considered as
individuals born 1981 – 1995) preferred web pages including “a large main image,
pictures of celebrities, little text, and a search feature” (p. 10). The conclusion supports
the findings in this study regarding the high mean of the size web page, where the stimulus
was constructed of a large image and a small amount of text. However, the conducted
one-way ANOVA did not present any statistically significant differences in mean values
between different age groups. The results are indicating that for this sample, age was not
a factor regarding preference for size. Further use replies of the size stimulus were almost
statistically significant between genders, indicating that size could be statistically
significant in a larger sample. Significant differences between age groups and male and
female responses are often assumed; however, the results of the conducted one-way
ANOVA’s demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

5.2 Conclusions
The results from the conducted repeated measures ANOVA's revealed statistically
significant pairings in all of the categories. The existence of statistically significant
63

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

pairings indicates a conclusive difference between the pairings and that similar results are
likely to be seen in a different sample. Appeal ratings had the highest number of
statistically significant pairings, suggesting that the differences in stimuli greatly
influence perceived appeal. Whereas for ratings of trustworthiness and further use, the
number of statistically significant pairings were considerably lower, implying that for this
study, the perceived trustworthiness and likelihood for further use is not based on
differences in design. For impression ratings, roughly half of the pairings were
statistically significant, meaning that differences in design had somewhat of an
effect. However, the differences were not as distinct as for appeal ratings.
The web page designs used in the study incorporated attributes such as navigation bars,
social media icons, call-to-action-buttons, and profile icons. As seen in the results, high
aesthetic treatments and the use of familiar icons and features create higher
prototypicality and, as a result of that, overall high ratings of trustworthiness.
Additionally, web page design has developed considerably during the past two decades,
and most web pages are designed in consideration of high aesthetic treatments. Web pages
are thus more aesthetic and have more elements that signify prototypicality than at the
time prior research was conducted.
In conclusion, visually salient elements influence pre-use first impressions to a different
extent. For visual appeal ratings, the differences in visually salient elements had a
significant impact on the results. Whereas for trustworthiness ratings, the differences in
salient elements had little to no impact. The impact was somewhat distinguishable for
impression ratings, and for further use intentions, the effect was insignificant. The lack
of a significantly visually salient element and a visual hierarchy did not result in lower
ratings as hypothesized, concluding that the applied high aesthetic treatments and
prototypicality of the stimulus were enough to ensure favorable perceptions of appeal,
trustworthiness, and overall impression.

5.2.1 Practical implications
As previous research within first impressions has demonstrated, the first 50 milliseconds
of exposure is essential (Lindgaard et al., 2006; Tractinsky et al., 2006). Pre-use first
impressions are predominantly based on visual stimulus, meaning that presented visual
stimulus influences the pre-use first impression and the following steps regarding the
impression formation process. Web page designers need to consider the first impression
of their designs. Because of the halo effect, first impressions have long-lasting effects,
both positive and negative.
For web page designers, this study's results illustrate the importance of prototypicality
and general aesthetic treatments. The results demonstrated that regarding trustworthiness
ratings, the differences in visual design had an insignificant impact. However, ratings
were favorable due to the high aesthetic treatments and prototypicality of the created web
pages. Further supporting the results suggested in Tuch et al.’s (2012) study, that to
achieve trustworthiness, web designers should consider the level of prototypicality and
visual complexity.

5.3 Limitations and suggestions for further research
Naturally, there were some limitations to the scope of the study. In order to gain more
accurate insight, it would be desired to study a larger and more diverse sample. The
sample used in this study was diverse in age; however, the participants' education and
backgrounds were reasonably similar. In addition, as for any online survey, it is
impossible to know if the participants have replied to the survey truthfully and followed
the given instructions.
This study revealed ratings on appeal, trustworthiness, impressions, and the likelihood of
further exploring web pages. The used stimuli represented hypothetical web pages of
blogs and businesses, possibly affecting the responses of further use. In order to obtain
more accurate results, the participants should be asked why they chose to continue
exploring the web page and why they did not. Throughout the study, no insight into the
65

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

motive of participants' answers was uncovered. A study uncovering the exact influencing
elements should be conducted to understand participants' precise perceptions.
Additionally, a suggestion for future research would be to include an eye-tracking
experiment to ensure the saliency of elements. The stimuli employed in the study could
have been altered and designed for months to ensure that none of the other included design
elements challenge the suggested entry point. Since an eye-tracking experiment was
unavailable, for this study, there is no proof of salience.

6 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH
Webbdesign för första intryck – hur påverkar visuellt framträdande
designelement användarnas första intryck?
Följande kapitel presenterar en svensk sammanfattning av avhandlingen som undersöker
första intryck av webbsidor, faktorer som påverkar dessa första intryck, samt en
granskning av allmänna designriktlinjer och hur dessa påverkar användarnas
uppfattningar.

6.1 Inledning
I dagens läge väljer allt fler företag att enbart förekomma online utan några fysiska lokaler
eller mötesplatser för möjliga konsumenter. Detta har bidragit till ett överflöd av okända
aktörer som tävlar över samma konsumenter. I takt med att nya aktörer ökar online, ökar
även konsumenternas skepticism mot dessa. För nya aktörer är det svåraste nödvändigtvis
inte att locka konsumenten till webbplatsen utan det komplicerade är däremot att få dem
att hållas på en och samma sida mer än några sekunder. I brist på tidigare interaktioner,
vad är det som lockar konsumenten att hållas kvar? Vad är det som övertygar
konsumenten att webbplatsen är pålitlig och värd att utforska ytterligare?
Vikten av ett starkt intryck online och speciellt ett positivt sådant har argumenterats för
aktivt. Även för väletablerade företag spelar webbplatsen en stor roll. Webbplatsen kan
till och med vara avgörande ifall företaget önskar behålla existerande och attrahera nya
kunder. För företag som ännu inte etablerat sig på marknaden är en välfungerade, attraktiv
och pålitlig webbplats grundläggande. I fall användaren inte har någon tidigare erfarenhet
av en aktör spelar det första intrycket en stor roll. Enligt tidigare forskning kan både
positiva och negativa första intryck ha långvariga effekter på en användare (Lindgaard et
al., 2006). Lindgaard m.fl. (2006) studie bevisar att pålitliga första intryck av webbsidor
formas ytterst snabbt, så snabbt som inom 50 millisekunder. Detta i sin tur tyder på att
första intryck främst baserar sig på visuella element eftersom en användare inte medvetet
hinner bearbeta informationen på en så kort tid.
67

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

6.2 Syfte och forskningsfrågor
Syftet med denna avhandling är att få en inblick av de faktorer som påverkar första
intryck, specifikt inom webbdesign, samt vilken roll specifika visuella designelement
spelar när första intryck bildas. Användare formar konstant första intryck då de besöker
nya webbsidor eller konsumerar nytt material från bekanta aktörer. Dessa formade intryck
har möjligheten att påverka användarens hela användarupplevelse, både med kort- och
långsiktig inverkan (Tuch et al., 2012). Det är således viktigt att förstå hur och till vilken
grad första intryck inverkar på användarupplevelsen men även hur dessa intryck uppstår
och vilka faktorer som påverkar skapandet av första intryck.
För att förstå första intryck och deras inverkan uppstår det även ett behov att förstå hur
användare läser webbsidor och vad för slags mönster användarnas beteende ger upphov
till. Den virtuella miljön består i hög grad av enbart visuella element och i och med detta
är det viktigt att förstå hur dessa visuella element påverkar användaren och hur specifika
val inom design kan inverka inte enbart på användarens uppfattning men även
användarens uppmärksamhet (Kahn, 2017). Användarens uppmärksamhet har en
inverkan på hur användaren betraktar webbplatsen medan användarens uppmärksamhet
påverkas av visuellt framträdande element (Peters & Itti, 2007).
För att uppnå det huvudsakliga syftet med denna avhandling har nedanstående
forskningsfrågor formulerats:
1. Vilka faktorer påverkar första intryck inom människa-datorinteraktion (HumanComputer Interaction)?
2. Hur påverkar Faradays visuellt framträdande designelement användarens första
intryck av visuell attraktion, trovärdighet, allmänna uppfattning och fortsatt
användning av en webbplats?

68

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

6.3 Litteraturöversikt
Litteraturöversikten kommer att behandla relevanta ämnesområden för avhandlingen, så
som användning och granskningsbeteende av webbsidor, användarupplevelse och
relevant forskning av första intryck. Ytterligare kommer även visuella designelement och
visuell hierarki behandlas som en väsentlig del för att förstå vad som påverkar
utformningen av första intryck.

6.3.1 Webbsidor
Framgångsrika och funktionerande webbsidor är enligt Thielsch, Blotenberg och Jaron
(2014) en kombination av relevant material, en hög nivå av användbarhet och ett
tilltalande utseende. Dessa tre faktorer är essentiella eftersom de påverkar användarens
perception och betygsättning av webbplatsen. Användarupplevelse är ett begrepp som
ofta missuppfattas vara detsamma som användbarhet men det är viktigt att skilja åt dessa
begrepp. Användbarhet mäter hur lätt det är för användaren att fullfölja möjliga uppgifter
medan användarupplevelse kan definieras som användarens hela upplevelse, innefattande
användarens känslor, tankar och uppfattning av webbplatsen (Albert & Tullis, 2013)
Den visuella designen av ett system eller en webbplats användargränssnitt, kan ha en stor
inverkan på användarupplevelsen. Enligt Michailidou m.fl. (2008) kan man med hjälp av
visuell

design

strategiskt

implementera

designelement

för

att

förbättra

användarengagemang, intresse, önskad uppfattning och visuell attraktion Linjer, former,
färger, texturer, typsnitt, former med mera klassas som designelement. Inom människadatorinteraktion klassas även ikoner, textfält, åtgärdsknappar (call-to-action button) och
popup-skärmar som designelement (Lynch, 1994).
Hur användare betraktar webbsidor kan förklaras med hjälp av ögonrörelser.
Ögonrörelser styrs i allmänhet av hur bilder bearbetas antingen genom en nerifrån-uppprocess eller en uppifrån-ner-process (Sutcliffe & Namoune, 2008). Även om användare
är olika uppvisar de ändå relativt liknande allmänna mönster när de bearbetar visuellt
material. Nielsen (2006) åskådliggjorde i sin forskning att det så kallade F-mönstret är
69

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

det vanligaste användare uppvisar. Allmänna mönster ger upphov till riktlinjer för
placering av visuella element och text. Dessa allmänna mönster för ögonrörelser och
uppmärksamhet går enligt forskning att manipulera till en viss grad. Enligt Faraday
(2000) uppmärksammar användare visuella element enligt en hierarki, där det elementet
som står högst upp i hierarkin uppmärksammas först.
Faradays (2000) visuella hierarki:
1. Rörelse
2. Storlek
3. Bild
4. Färg
5. Typsnitt
6. Placering

6.3.2 Första intryck
Första intryck har en betydande roll då det kommer till att forma uppfattningar, åsikter
samt till fortsatt agerande. Första intryck kan definieras som en hastig inledande
evaluering av en webbplats, ett system eller en applikation. Denna inledande evaluering
påverkar måttligt det slutliga intrycket (Sheng et al., 2013). Lindgaard m.fl. (2006)
demonstrerade i sin undersökning att tillförlitliga första intryck fastställs inom 50
millisekunder och att dessa hastigt formade intryck kan ha långvariga effekter, även
negativa. Ett negativt första intryck kan ge upphov till mer negativa bedömningar av
material och användbarhet på webbsidan. Detta i sin tur innebär att en webbsida med
relevant material och hög användbarhet klassas ofta som sämre ifall det första intrycket
inte är bra.
Effekten av första intryck inom människa-datorinteraktion har studerats bland annat
angående användbarhet (Tractinsky et al., 2006), tillit (Karvonen et al., 2000) och
kredibilitet (Robins & Holmes, 2008). Forskarna har varit eniga över faktumet att inom
första intryck spelar visuell attraktion en stor roll; eftersom det visuella bearbetas
70

M. Molin: Designing for first impressions

undermedvetet först lämnar det en liten roll för materialet och användbarheten att
påverka.

6.4 Metodik
På basen av de formulerade forskningsfrågorna, de korta exponeringstiderna för första
intryck och tidigare forskning föredrogs en kvantitativ forskningsstrategi. En kvalitativ
forskningsstrategi ger en djupare inblick i hur en användare resonerar, dock skulle
effekten av ett första intryck som baserar sig enbart på visuella element vara svårare att
säkerställa då användaren får mera tid till att reflektera.
För enkätundersökningen framställdes sex stycken fiktiva webbplatser, en webbplats för
varje designelement i Faradays (2000) visuella hierarki. Utöver dessa skapades även en
webbplats utan någon klar visuell hierarki för att kunna jämföra skillnader till webbplatser
med visuellt framträdande element. Webbplatserna skapades enligt de riktlinjer som
presenterades i Stills (2018) undersökning, den allmänna riktlinjer var att designelementet
i fråga skall vara det mest framträdande elementet på webbsidan. Designelement som
klassas högre upp i hierarkin skall inte kunna uppfattas som mer framträdande.
Den första delen av enkätundersökningen innefattade demografiska frågor så som kön,
ålder, utbildningsnivå och en fråga om färgblindhet. Den andra delen av
enkätundersökningen omfattade sju stycken korta filmklipp med designstimuli varav det
första klippet var en del av en testrunda. Filmklippen presenterades i följande
slumpmässigt dragna ordning: (1) typsnitt, (2) bild, (3) ingen hierarki, (4) färg, (5) storlek,
(6) placering. Efter varje filmklipp bads deltagaren att betygsätta designstimuli på en
skala från 1 till 5 enligt hur attraktiv de upplevde webbplatsen, hur pålitlig de ansåg
webbplatsen vara, vilket slags intryck webbplatsen gav (bra – dåligt), samt med hur stor
sannolikhet de skulle fortsätta utforska webbplatsen.
Enkäten delades främst via kanaler som nådde både studerande och anställda vid Åbo
Akademi men begränsades inte till någon specifik målgrupp. Enkäten besvarades av 47
deltagare och det erhållna data behandlades med Microsoft Excel och IBM SPSS (version

26.0). Av deltagarna identifierade sig 55,3 % som kvinnor och 44,7 % som män. Tre av
deltagarna var färgblinda och uteslöts således från resten av undersökningen.

6.5 Resultat och diskussion
Målet med denna studie var att undersöka faktorer som inverkar användarens första
intryck inom människa-datorinteraktion, samt granska hur visuellt framträdande
designelement påverkar första intryck av visuell attraktion, trovärdighet, allmänna
uppfattningar och fortsatt användning av en webbplats. Från enkätundersökningen
analyserades svaren av 44 deltagare. Resultaten för visuell attraktion var blandade dock
var deltagarna ense över att stimuli för storlek och ingen hierarki upplevdes som de mest
attraktiva.
Envägs variansanalyser (ANOVA) utfördes för att granska signifikanta skillnader mellan
tre olika åldersgrupper, samt skillnader mellan män och kvinnor. Nya åldersgrupper
uppgjordes enligt följande: 1991 – 2000, 1990 – 1971, 1970 – 1954. Inga statistiskt
signifikanta samband hittades förutom för sambandet mellan kön och fortsatt användning.
Levene’s statistik på homogenitet av varians var statistiskt signifikant för svar på storlek
stimulus p < .001. Skillnaden mellan genomsnittsvärdet för kvinnor och män var nära till
signifikant F(1, 42) = 4.00, p = .05. Utgående från detta resultat kan svaren för fortsatt
användning av storleks stimulus från ett större sampel även uppskattas vara signifikanta.
För att granska statistiska skillnader mellan webbplatserna utfördes en variansanalys med
upprepade mätningar (repeated measures ANOVA) för varje fråga. Resultaten
åskådliggjorde statistisk signifikanta par för varje fråga, dock fanns det skillnader mellan
antalet av signifikanta par. För värderingar av visuell attraktion var enbart storlek och
ingen hierarki, bild och färg, samt typsnitt och placering icke signifikanta. Vilket innebär
att för de statistiskt signifikanta paren uppstod skillnaderna i värderingarna på grund av
skillnader i webbplatsens stimulus. För värderingar av trovärdighet framkom det enbart
några få statistiskt signifikanta par, vilket i tur betyder att skillnader i designstimuli inte
har en signifikant inverkan gällande värderingar av trovärdighet.

Resultaten från undersökningen demonstrerade att värderingar av visuell attraktion och
skillnader i designstimuli inte hade någon signifikant inverkan på användarens
värderingar av trovärdighet. Visuell attraktion påverkade den allmänna uppfattningen
positivt då värderingarna var genomsnittliga eller bättre, medan värderingar av visuell
attraktion under genomsnitt påverkade den allmänna uppfattningen negativt.
Webbplatsen för ingen hierarki genererade genomgående positiva resultat och bevisade
således att uteslutandet av visuellt framträdande element och en visuell hierarki, inte gav
upphov till sämre resultat. Avslutningsvis hade ålder och kön ingen signifikant inverkan
på värderingarna av visuell attraktion, trovärdighet, den allmänna uppfattningen eller
benägenheten för fortsatt användning.
