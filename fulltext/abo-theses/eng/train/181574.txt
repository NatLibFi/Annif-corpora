Title: Goodwill or Opportunism? The Use of Coopetition in SME Internationalisation:
Perspective of Finnish SMEs
Supervisor: Irene Kujala
Abstract:
In an increasingly complex and competitive global business environment, coopetition
emerges as a potentially valuable strategy for SMEs engaging in internationalisation.
Coopetition in SMEs is driven by lack of resources, liability of smallness and newness
as well as a need for complementary resources. These are limitations for SME
internationalisation. This thesis thus sets out to explore how and why SMEs use
coopetition in the internationalisation process, with a specific focus on Finnish SMEs.
The thesis explores the drivers of coopetition in SME internationalisation, the initiation
process for coopetitive relationships in Finnish SMEs as well as the results of
coopetition for internationalisation.
A resource–based view of coopetition is used in this thesis to explain how and why
SMEs engage in coopetition for their internationalisation efforts, with a theoretical
review examining the drivers of coopetition in SMEs.
The study is conducted via a qualitative research method, employing a case study of
two Finnish SMEs that are actively cooperating with their competitors. The data
gathering process used semi-structured interviews that were further analysed through
the thematic analysis process. The results find that, in the case of the two Finnish
SMEs studied for this thesis, SMEs see positive effects of using coopetition in the
internationalisation process. Both SMEs increased their international presence thanks
to cooperative interactions with their competitors that allowed them to reduce costs of
internationalising as compared to acting alone, reaching a larger customer segment and
improving business opportunities. The case study exhibits both opportunistic
behaviours to improve competitive positions in relation to coopetitive partners and acts
based on goodwill to help competitors. In addition, managerial implications for using
coopetition in the internationalisation process are discussed.

Introduction

1.1 Background
The study of coopetition has received increased attention from researchers trying to
understand its paradoxical nature (Bengtsson et al., 2016; Czakon, Mucha-Kus et al.,
2014). Coopetition is a merging of competition and cooperation that creates a new
type of strategic relationship between two or more engaging firms (Roig‐Tierno et al.,
2018). In the complex and highly competitive global business environment of today,
coopetition emerges as a potential strategy to gain a competitive advantage by
increasing innovation, sharing costs and risks, enabling economies of scale, forming
R&D joint ventures and giving access to external knowledge and resources (Bengtsson
& Kock, 2000; Park et al., 2014; Roig‐Tierno et al., 2018). Thus, companies with
mutual goals and convergent interests may collaborate to take advantage of some of
the benefits of coopetition (Zineldin, 2004). Zacharia, Plasch, Mohan & Gerschberger
(2019) recommend that companies in highly competitive industries use coopetition as
a regular strategy.
According to Czakon, Fernandez & Minà (2014) there is growing evidence that
coopetition strategy has been spreading in the business landscape. The same authors
mention how coopetition can exist between big corporations, business units within
firms, between similar or different organisations and SMEs.
SMEs often suffer from a lack of resources and knowledge, as well as reputation and
networking difficulties, leading to difficulties in internationalisation (Morais &
Ferreira, 2020). Lack of sufficient resources can make it difficult for SMEs to identify
and target new international opportunities and enter into new ventures, but access to
these same resources is seen as a starting point for internationalisation. Cooperative
strategies can help SMEs overcome some of the barriers to internationalisation by
allowing access to complementary resources. Additionally, cooperative strategies
involving competitors has seen an increase, meaning that competitive forces are no
longer considered as much of a barrier to cooperation and that more firms are working
closely with their competitors (Kock et al., 2010). Coopetition may thus be a viable
1

strategy for small firms to enhance their innovation and survivability (Lechner &
Dowling, 2003, Morris et al., 2007, Gast, 2017).
SMEs are an important part of economies all around the world, especially in the EU.
99% of businesses in the EU are SMEs, and 60% of total output in the business
enterprise sector comes from SMEs, yet they only manage 44% of total goods exports.
Only 4,9% of SMEs exported to the EU-27 and 3,1% outside the EU-27 in 2010
(Eurostat, 2011). This suggests that SMEs are at a disadvantage when it comes to
operating in international markets over larger multinationals (Falk & Hagsten, 2015).
Holmlund et al. (2007) found that coopetitive activities in an international setting did,
to some extent, help in export activities of SMEs.
It has been shown that coopetition between international alliances is more effective
for firm innovation than domestic alliances. These alliances may offer new and
different technologies, connections, locations and distribution channels, among others.
As such, coopetition can offer benefits for internationalising companies and be an
attractive strategy despite some of its challenges (Vanyushyn et al., 2018).
SME internationalisation and studies concerning it are on the rise (Kock et al., 2010)
as well as research attention towards coopetition as a new paradigm, but few studies
have combined the two. Vanyushyn et al. (2009) highlight the lack of previous
research in connecting coopetition with SME internationalisation, and this thesis
attempts to help fill this gap.
This thesis thus sets out to explore the role of coopetition in the internationalisation
process of Finnish SMEs.

1.2 Problem setting
Coopetition has gained increased attention from scholars trying to understand this
paradoxical relationship between firms (Dagnino and Padula, 2002; Czakon, MuchaKus & Rogalski, 2014; Bengtsson et al. 2016). However, further research on key

2

factors that influence coopetition performance in firms has been called for (Ritala,
2012). Previous research has focused on understanding and defining coopetition, and
while a lot of research has focused on particular areas and in attempting to broaden
the research field, contradicting typologies have been suggested by researchers
(Bengtsson et al., 2016). The same authors stress, in view of lacking previous research,
the need to further understand the drivers of coopetition, what actually happens during
coopetition and what the results of coopetition are (Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016).
Kock et al. (2010) highlight the need for more research on how competitors affect the
internationalization process. Previous studies have shown that companies actually rely
on competitor relations in the internationalisation process to gain some important
resources and emphasise the need to look at the horizontal relations of a firm when
studying the internationalisation process. Further, Luo (2004) states that coopetition
might be a good strategy when firms have mutually beneficial resources, and their
resources may best be combined with that of a competitor. Information and knowledge
sharing is also cited as a reason for coopetitive relationships when the firms operate in
the same industry (Kock et al. 2010).
Kock et al. (2010) imply that coopetition and international opportunities may
correlate, including for internationalisation of SMEs, but no studies have explored
what types of international opportunities arise or how different intensities of
coopetition influences them.
In their study on coopetition as a source for international opportunities, Kock et al.
(2010) highlight the need for further research. The authors emphasize the need for
studies on what the potential combinations are for a desirable coopetitive relation in
an international setting and what these imply strategically and practically for the firm.
They also highlight the need to understand the relation to competitors in the
internationalisation process.
Blanka & Traunmüller (2020) highlight the need for further research on how firms
find and select other firms to engage in coopetition with and how the relationship is
initiated. Previous research has studied how small entrepreneurial firms and bigger
established firms coopete, with less focus on how SMEs might initiate coopetition.
3

Blanka & Traunmüller (2020) study how third parties can connect firms in coopetitive
relationships but mention the limitations of their study as it only focuses on one case
study between a start–up and an established firm. Thus, they call for further research
on how firms in vertical relationships initiate coopetition.
Vanyushyn (2009) studies the effects of coopetition on internationalisation in western
Finnish SMEs through the motivational factors framework. Their research found that
38% of firms that exported products had cooperated actively with their competitors.
The companies that cooperated versus those that did not cooperate also had differences
in how they evaluated buyer inquires, possession of technical advantages, partner
demands and additionally in how they dealt with taxes. The authors call for more
research into this area as it is relatively unexplored, both in terms of the coopetition
between firms and SME internationalisation from a network perspective. Further, they
mention the insights that a qualitative study would give as it allows for a better look
at the practical aspects of coopetition in firms and how it is managed.
In summary, both coopetition and SME internationalisation offer room for further
studies into the subjects, with the former still being in the early stages of
understanding, and the effect of coopetition in SME internationalisation even more so.
In view of the above background on coopetition research and SME
internationalisation, this thesis sets out to study the role of coopetition on the
internationalisation process of SMEs in Finland. This thesis aims to understand how
Finnish SMEs are using coopetitive relations with their competitors to reach new
markets through internationalisation. The motive is to study the benefits of
coopetition, i.e., gaining access to new and complementary knowledge and economic
resources and overcoming certain liabilities faced by SMEs, and how they affect the
companies in the internationalisation process. The thesis aims to look at how
coopetition is initiated specifically for Finnish SMEs, what the coopetitive strategy
focuses on and what the rewards are for the SMEs. These research gaps mentioned in
this problem setting have motivated the objective of this thesis. The objective and
accompanying research questions guiding the thesis will be discussed next.

1.3 Objective and research questions
4

The objective of this thesis is to understand the role of coopetition in the
internationalisation process of Finnish SMEs. The theoretical objective is to
investigate the drivers of coopetition in SMEs and explain what motivates SMEs to
engage in coopetition for internationalisation. The empirical objective aims to answer
the questions of how coopetitive relationships in Finnish SMEs are initiated in
practice,

and

how

engaging

in

coopetitive

relationships

impacts

their

internationalisation performance and activities. The normative objective aims to
provide

evidence

for

practitioners

on

how

to

utilize

coopetition

for

internationalisation, specifically in Finnish SMEs.
To support the objective of the thesis, the following research questions have been
developed.
RQ1: What are the drivers for coopetition that determine an SMEs decision to
internationalise?
RQ2: How are coopetitive relationships initiated in Finnish SMEs?
RQ3: How does coopetition impact Finnish SME internationalisation?
RQ4: What are the managerial implications of coopetition in SME
internationalisation?

1.4 Focus and delimitations
The contextual setting for this thesis is limited to Finnish SMEs. For the purpose of
this study, SMEs are defined as enterprises with 1-250 employees, have annual sales
of less than 50€ million or an annual balance sheet that does not exceed 43€ million
(Eurostat, 2011). The definition is set by the EU for implementing SME specific
policies and used in this thesis to set a unified and fair criterium for selecting and
consequently interviewing SMEs.
The study focuses on two Finnish SMEs that are using coopetitive strategies to
internationalise. Company A is a Finnish based wireless communications technology

5

manufacturer with an aggressive focus on reaching new markets abroad. They have
used coopetitive strategies to enter new markets, as well as in R&D and sharing of
costs. The case study focuses on their internationalisation into the Indonesian market
for electricity distribution and as a provider of communications technology for heavy
construction equipment manufacturers in the USA.
Company B is a Finnish based start–up in the construction industry, providing
affordable, sustainable and easy to use building blocks for especially developing
markets. They have used coopetitive strategies to reach a wider audience for their
product, cooperating with competitors for visibility and cost reduction in common
activities. They have expanded and built factories in several developing countries that
have high demand for new housing.
The theoretical framework for this thesis is based on previous contribution to the study
of coopetition. The thesis draws from these existing theoretical contributions to
explain why SMEs engage in coopetition and how and why it is used in
internationalisation activities.
The theoretical framework is limited to the resource–based view of coopetition, and
this thus sets the conceptual setting of the thesis. The resource–based view explains
the mechanisms of how firms achieve sustainable competitive advantages from
utilising its internal resources (Feela, 2020). The resource–based perspective also
explains how firms use resources to overcome barriers faced when internationalising
and diversifying products in competitive markets (Barney et al., 2001). Barney et al.
(2001) also mention how firms that possess certain resources can generate above
normal profits compared to other firms. In the event that a firm lacks these resources,
firms, especially SMEs, cooperate to use pooled resources to gain competitive
advantages (Feela, 2020). The resource–based view also explains how firms that lack
sufficient internal resources seek coopetitive relationships to achieve scale and scope
(Thomason et al., 2013). The thesis thus sets out to investigate how internationalising
SMEs that lack internal resources, as explained by the resource–based view, overcome
these limitations by engaging in coopetition.

6

The basis of this thesis is that SMEs cooperate with other competitors that have
congruent interests and goals and can thus help each other to internationalise by
sharing resources not available to the individual firm. The presumption is that SMEs
seek other companies to work with as it may reduce costs and get access to customers
and other contacts in international markets. While the management of a coopetitive
relationship is an interesting element of coopetitive activities, this is excluded from
this thesis. Instead, this thesis focuses on how the coopetitive relationships are
practically initiated and what the results are in regard to increased international
activity.

1.5 Methodology
This thesis will use a qualitative research method with a multiple–case study research
design for data collection. A case study will allow for a large number of data to be
collected for a few study objects (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000). The case study method
allows for the expansion and generalisation of theories because it combines new
empirical insights with existing theories, which is particularly useful when studying
topics that have received little research attention before. It also helps in developing
and testing new empirical evidence (Vissak, 2010).
Two case companies were chosen for this thesis, with two interviews conducted with
persons involved with both coopetitive and internationalising activities of the
respective firms.

1.6 Key definitions
Coopetition: Coopetition is a paradoxical relationship, either horizontal or vertical,
between two or more actors who engage in competition and cooperation
simultaneously (Bengtsson & Kock, 2014). An important note for coopetition is that
firms may engage in cooperation and competition in separate activities. For example,

7

they might cooperate in R&D activities and compete in other activities (Kock et al.,
2010).
SME: This thesis uses the European Union definition of SMEs which defines it as a
company with less than 250 employees, sales of less than 50€ million annually and a
balance sheet of less than 43€ million (Eurostat, 2011).
Internationalisation: the process of extending a firms operation to markets outside the
origin country (Monticelli et al., 2018). It can also be interpreted as increasing
involvement in international operations (Jankowska, 2015).

1.7 Disposition
The thesis has thus far introduced the topic, objective and research questions and
method used to collect data. In the following literature review (chapter 2) the concept
of coopetition will be further expanded upon. A more detailed review of the method
used for this thesis will be given in chapter 3. Chapter 4 will present the results from
the data, followed by an analysis of the findings in chapter 5. Discussion and future
research paths are presented in chapter 6. Finally, a Swedish summary of the thesis
will be presented in chapter 7.

Concept of coopetition

This chapter will go over the concept of coopetition, its theoretical roots and
perspectives from which it is studied. Further, the chapter will introduce the reader to
the benefits and drawbacks, the importance of trust and mutual benefit and how it is
initiated. Theory on SME coopetition and internationalisation will also be discussed.

2.1 Introduction to coopetition
Coopetition is the simultaneous cooperative and competitive interaction between
actors (Bengtsson et al., 2016), and evidence suggest that coopetition as a deliberate
strategy in firms has increased (Czakon et al., 2014). Zacharia, Plasch, Mohan &
Gerschberger (2019) say that coopetition gives an opportunity to increase the market
size through cooperation as compared to trying to capture larger market share by being
competitive. It is a merging and coexistence of competition, which stimulates new
rent-seeking skills and processes, and cooperation, which allows access to
complementary and otherwise unattainable resources (Luo, 2007; Yami et al., 2010;
Akdoğan & Cingšz, 2012). The coopetitive relationship between actors can be
analysed at any level, in other words, it exists at all levels of an organisation or industry
where actors collaborate to achieve mutual goals (Zineldin, 2004).
Coopetition provides benefits and complementary goals when there is simultaneous
cooperation and competition. This notion was introduced in the seminal work by
Brandenburger and Nalebuff (1996) which has become a significant theoretical stream
for coopetition. It suggests that a coopetitive relationship always comes as a result of
a network. In other words, coopetition is not a possible strategy for one sole actor, but
rather relies on a network or “sets of two or more connected exchange relationships”
(Chou & Zolkiewski, 2018, p. 25).
An example of coopetition can be found between Sony and Samsung. They cooperate
on R&D by sharing resources and costs, and thus have consistently developed high
quality and innovative products, with lower costs compared to other manufacturers.

9

However, in for example the television market, they compete with each other and have
independent manufacturing with varying levels of efficiency and quality. It is then up
to the customer to decide which product to use. Companies can thus cooperate in
certain product areas and compete with a different product (Thomason et al., 2013).
Although many have researched coopetition, it still seems to lack a definition clearly
agreed upon (Soppe et al., 2014). Bengtsson et al. (2016) argue that defining
coopetition is hard since it exists at many levels such as in networks, dyadic
partnerships and within organisations. Two schools of thought emerge in their
literature review of coopetition, the Actor School of Thought and the Activity School
of Thought. The actor school of thought’s main concept is that coopetition occurs in
value–nets or networks where actors cooperate to make a bigger “cake” and then
maximise their share of the profits. The activity school of thought suggests that firms
cooperate on some activities but compete in others. This occurs more often in dyadic
relationships, between two firms, along horizontal and vertical relationships
(Gnyawali et al., 2016; Bengtsson et al., 2016)
Coopetition, according to Bengtsson & Kock (2000), is complex because it involves
two opposite interactive logics, competition and cooperation. Firms engaged in
coopetition must manage both hostility and friendliness from the competitor.
According to the authors these two opposite logics must be separated, which poses a
significant challenge for managers.
This interorganizational relationship relies on the notion that the coopetitive
relationships is mutually beneficial. Consequently, some preconditions exist for the
creation and development of a mutually beneficial relationship, as explained by
Zineldin (2004):
-

Organisations are willing to engage in an interactive exchange relationship

-

Each party possesses resources that the other part wants

-

Each part is willing to give up some of its resources to receive in return the
resource belonging to the other party

-

Each party is free to accept or reject terms and conditions of exchange that will
leave them better off
10

-

The parties are able to communicate and interact with each other

-

The parties recognize the ethical values and norms, interdependencies,
commitment and sustainable long-term relationship

-

The parties can strike a positive balance between the pros and cons of the
relationship

It is worth mentioning how coopetition differs from alliances and collaboration
between firms. While they are similar, alliances do not necessarily include competitors
and also do not always feature high levels of trust between the actors like in coopetitive
relationships. As opposed to coopetition, cooperative alliances are often not short–
term strategies or activities surrounding short–term projects and do not feature the
cooperative and competitive interactions that characterises coopetition. However,
alliances can be described as being coopetitive when the actors cooperate in one
market and compete in another market (Zacharia et al., 2019).
This study uses the definition of coopetition devised by Bengtsson & Kock (2014).
This definition says that coopetition is a paradoxical relationship, either horizontal or
vertical, between two or more actors who engage in competition and cooperation
simultaneously.
The next section goes over the paradigms that have influenced coopetitive research
and the theoretical perspectives that coopetitive relationships are viewed from.

2.1.1

Coopetitive perspective

The simultaneous competitive and cooperative nature between rivals has not always
been considered. The literature on strategic management has historically focused on
rivalry, the competitive paradigm. It assumes that firms seek a competitive advantage
at the expense of other companies’ ability to get that competitive advantage. The
rivalry between firms stems from competitive interdependencies that diverge from one
another meaning their interests and goals are different. In more recent times,
cooperative interdependencies, the cooperative paradigm, has gained more attention.
If firms have similar or converging interest structures, it can lead to a win-win situation
11

because of how the converging interests shape inter-firm interdependencies. The
cooperative paradigm suggests that firms seek collaborative advantages where the
success of one firm means the success of another firm (Padula & Dagnino, 2007).
Coopetition combines cooperation and competition paradigms. It is therefore worth
briefly reviewing what these paradigms are and what they mean for coopetition.
Competitive perspective
The competitive perspective assumes that a firms behaviour is based on an individual
interest search. This interests search is divided into horizontal and vertical
interdependence. Horizontal interdependence (interdependence meaning that firms are
dependent on each other) is the search for above normal profits as a firm reaches some
sort of advantageous position on the market (Dagnino, 2009). It can also stem from
firm specific knowledge or skills that are then applied to offering better products on
the market. Competition thus occurs when firms that offer very similar products or
services compete for the same customers. Some firms are better able to compete and
can thus capture a greater share of the market and their ability to innovate sets them
apart from other firms. Horizontal interdependence suggests that a firm seeks better
profits through a better position in an industry, unique resources or competencies.
Vertical interdependence suggests, in turn, that value comes through economic
exchange in a network where power is equally shared. A firm can, however, use its
potential higher position in the network to learn about new opportunities and apply
them better for a stronger competitive position (Osarenkhoe, 2010).
Cooperative perspective
The cooperative perspective is essentially the opposite of the competitive perspective,
encouraging collaboration. This perspective changed the way business was conducted
by making firms realize that cooperating with other firms that have convergent
interests can give mutual benefits. Firms do not exist on the market alone, but in a
complex, interactive and continuously changing landscape with other firms and
customers. In this landscape the firms build relations and improve commitments to
each other to gain value generation and mutually beneficial networks (Osarenkhoe,
2010). Cooperation is also a response to the increasing competitiveness in the business
environment. Cooperative interfirm relationships can be seen as strategic assets for a
12

firm that in turn give competitive advantages on the market. Further, the cooperative
perspective gives some economic incentive to continue the same relationship that then
reduces chances of opportunistic behaviour (Dagnino, 2009).
More recently, however, firms both cooperate and compete simultaneously. To
become better competitors, Walley (2007) notes that firms must also be equally good
at cooperating and that firms should consider it as an important strategy to adopt.
Coopetitive perspective
The coopetitive perspective realises that both value-creation and value-appropriation
take place in interfirm interdependence. In this interdependence there are convergent
goals and interests that involve both competitive and cooperative aspects. However, it
does not mean all goals and interests match across the firms participating in the
coopetitive strategy (Dagnino, 2009).
Padula and Dagnino (2007) mention that the competitive perspective is a mix of both
positive and negative dependencies. A firm may be using another firm or industry
actor for a win–win opportunity to gain a competitive advantage over the other.
Gaining a competitive advantage at the expense of their competitor is a negative
interdependence from the perspective of the relationship between the two actors. From
the individual firms perspective, it would be advantageous as the firm is looking to
exploit a win–win situation with the competitor. The competitor is of course wary of
being taken advantage of. This creates the positive interdependence, as both firms seek
to win. The name for this mix of positive and negative interdependencies that make
up cooperation between competitors became coopetition, as coined by Brandenburger
and Nalebuff in their work published in 1996 (Padula & Dagnino, 2007).

2.1.2

Coopetition strategies

Interfirm coopetition strategy allows businesses involved to manage “partially
convergent interests and goal structures” (Dagnino, 2009, p. 29), and through this
strategy create value. The recognition of convergent interests and similar goal
agreement between firms is the baseline of a coopetition strategy for value creation.
13

A firm can gain knowledge and information from coopetition that would otherwise
not be available (Dagnino, 2009). Knowledge is valuable for firms and a coopetitive
strategy should highlight how knowledge can be shared between the firms (Seepana
et al., 2020). Coopetitive strategies can enable firms to create economic value with
their competitors and then get some of that value for themselves. The appropriation of
this created value is continuously changing and negotiated between the actors in the
coopetitive relationship (Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2019).
According to Chou & Zolkiewski (2018) coopetition involves both value creation and
appropriation. Value creation increases the total revenues while value appropriation
concerns a firms private share of the created value. As Brandenburger and Nalebuff
(1996) conceptualise it, by creating a bigger pie together (value creation) and thus
getting a larger share of the pie (value appropriation). This can be challenging as firms
need to balance both value creation and value appropriation in a relationship (Ritala
& Tidström, 2014). This is another reason why coopetition differentiates itself from
cooperation with non–competitors. Coopetition will in practice tie together the firms
internal and external value networks to allow and sustain business opportunities
through a value–based strategy (Chou & Zolkiewski, 2018).
As stated, value creation in coopetition aims to combine resources of firms to create
more value than if the firm was acting alone. Firms in coopetition can create value
through shared markets where the firms are similarly positioned and gives both
partners a better understanding of the market. This kind of positioning would enable
firms to understand the complexities of the market more easily. Firms may also agree
on standards, platforms and common principles, allowing that market to grow and
function better (Ritala & Tidström, 2014).
The idea behind a coopetitive strategy is that rather than a single firm displaying rent–
seeking behaviour or value appropriation to increase its profits, coopetition can bring
together firms to encourage value creation through entrepreneurial behaviour.
Dagnino (2009) argues that a coopetitive strategy realises effective transfer of
information and processes that is supported by the assurance of a long and stable
relationship between participants. This kind of a relationship also spurs continuous
improvements over complacency.
14

Firms are participating in these types of coopetitive relationships to achieve greater
value creation than they would by operating alone. Some of the benefits that are
associated with engaging in coopetition with a rival firm are not always aligned with
the firms individual interests. Firms must thus manage a careful balance of cooperation
that maximises value creation at the expense of some individual interests but also
pushing strategic objectives for value appropriation for the own firm to remain
competitive (Ritala & Tidström, 2014).
The level of coopetition between firms can also vary. The degree at which firms
cooperate or compete is different and can range from being more cooperative or more
competitive. Bengtsson & Kock (2002) identify three different types of coopetition.
There is the cooperation–dominated relationship, the equal relationship and the
competition–dominated relationship. These exist between relationships that are purely
cooperative or competitive.
Cooperation–dominated coopetition
Coopetitive relationships that are cooperation dominated tend to exist between actors
whose activities are further away from the customer. Cooperation–dominated
relationships tend to also exist when actors have heterogenous resources and are
willing to share the resources between each other (Morris et al., 2007).
Competition–dominated coopetition
Actors will try to acquire and use their partners resources. Competition focused
coopetition often increases pressure for the company to better its economic
performance (Kumar, A., Connell, J. and Bhattacharyya, A., 2020). Often, the
activities near the customer experience relations that are more competitively oriented,
while activities further away from the customer are cooperative. This relation or
balance between what activities should be cooperative and which should be
competitive is challenging for companies to manage (Kock, Nisuls, Söderqvist, 2010).
Coopetition relations can have a variation of characteristics ranging from weak, equal
and strong relations between participating actors, and these in turn affect the
international opportunities gained from coopetition. Strong and equal coopetition form
15

continuous and more extensive relations, while weak coopetition leads to short-term
opportunities as a result of less cooperation and more competition (Kock et al., 2010).
Coopetitive activities are often discussed in relation to customer proximity.
Traditionally it has been proposed that firms cooperate in activities far away from the
customer and compete in activities close to the customer. (Bengtsson et al., 2016).
However, cooperation can in some cases also occur in activities close to the customer
such as in marketing and branding. The reasons are similar to activities further away
from the customer, namely in reducing costs, but also in forming more coherent, strong
and valuable brand equity through the network (Lindström & Polsa, 2016).
Horizontal and vertical coopetition
Horizontal relationships describe a focal firms relationship to their competitor and
how they cooperate, forming a coopetitive structure. Horizontal coopetition is a
situation where firms that are competitors cooperate on some activities upstream and
downstream of the product that they are competing with against each other (Zgarni,
2019). Vertical relationships describe buyer–supplier relations, which are cooperative
by nature (de Resende et al., 2018). Vertical coopetition occurs between two firms
who are actively engaged in exchange of goods and services while simultaneously
engaging in cooperative and competitive activities. These relationships can be
described as firm–supplier, firm–buyer or firm–subcontractor (Soppe et al., 2014).
Vertical coopetition is easier to identify as it exists in a more traditional supply chain
where activities are clearly defined and based around economic exchange and are
usually formal agreements. Horizontal coopetition is less visible as cooperation is
based around informal relationships, and the exchange between the actors is less
economic and based more on social and information exchange. Horizontal coopetition
also enables firms to keep better track of each other through customers and for
example trade fairs and meetings (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).

2.1.3

Benefits and drawbacks of coopetition

Coopetition offers many benefits for firms, and these will be discussed next.

16

An increasingly complex and competitive global business environment has increased
the interest in coopetitive relationships. Technological advancement is fast and
product life cycles shorter, with R&D costs increasing all the time. These conditions
encourage more and more firms to cooperate with one another to keep up. Increased
interest from firms to be sustainable and contribute in more ways than just
economically also contribute to firms seeking coopetitive relationships (Cygler et al.,
2018). With an increasing pressure to survive and innovate, coopetition emerges as an
essential way for modern businesses to survive, with some authors saying a coopetitive
strategy offers huge potential for firm development (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).
Coopetition strategies allow firms to tap into resources that would otherwise be
unavailable and take advantage of competitive and cooperative elements. Coopetitive
strategies give firms the ability to seek new, rare and complementary resource
combinations, skills and processes (Yami, 2010). Combining resources from
cooperating firms creates synergies that would not otherwise be possible, and further
makes it more difficult for competitors outside the relationship to imitate,
strengthening the market position of the cooperating firms (Cygler et al., 2018).
Coopetition strategies also enhance firm’s control on uncertainties and improves
organizational performance to gain a competitive advantage, enable economies of
scale and lowers costs (Akdoğan & Cingšz, 2012).
Coopetition can also improve the innovation capabilities of the firms. For the above–
mentioned reasons, sharing resources creates intangible assets and knowledge sharing
that lead to a more efficient organisation and product development and introduction
(Cygler et al., 2018). In a setting of intense competition, pressure is put on the firms
to improve their products and innovate, which is further improved when competitors
are able to observe each other’s activities and reactions to the market which leads to
them imitating each other. There are also psychological factors dealing with pride and
reputation that drive the firms to continuously improve. These factors lead to more
dynamic industries that are better able to cope with outside threats (Bengtsson & Kock,
2000).
Other benefits of competing firms working together are reduced entry barriers for
entering new markets. Difficulties of entering new markets are reduced by lowering
17

the risk when working together with firms that have congruent interests, even if they
are rivals (Akdoğan & Cingšz, 2012; Yami et al., 2010).
The three key dimensions to coopetition are mutual benefit, trust and commitment
(Morris et al., 2007). Benefits can derive from both the cooperative and competitive
aspects of coopetition, but only the cooperative aspect of coopetition is dependent on
mutual benefits (Akdoğan & Cingšz, 2012).
Trust is an important factor for coopetition strategy since one party must be confident
and believe that the other party is willing to share resources and communicate
(Bengtsson et al., 2010). As a factor of commitment, trust increases when actors
involved adapt to the necessities of the coopetitive relationship (Akdoğan & Cingšz,
2012).
Commitment to the relationship means that the actors involved have a desire to enter
into the relationship and relies on mutual adaptation in terms of changing processes,
expectations and approaches to resource allocation to make the coopetitive strategy
work (Akdoğan & Cingšz, 2012). Commitment increases when a business realises the
benefits of coopetition, some of which include lower costs, better productivity,
improved customer satisfaction and improved product performance (Dagnino, 2009).
It can thus be said that the three factors; trust, commitment and mutual benefit, all
affect each other and are essential to a coopetitive relationship.
Interfirm trust is dynamic and can thus continuously evolve and change between the
different levels of trust. This trust dynamic can evolve vertically, in degree of intensity,
and horizontally, in time. The above normal returns in a coopetitive interfirm
relationship are achieved when the level of trust is stable and stronger (Dagnino,
2009).
In value creation there might exist some opportunistic behaviour that forces other
actors in the network to be more protective of their resources and knowledge, leading
to situations where opportunities to collaborate are not realised and leading to the
value creation potential decreasing. Similarly, in value appropriation there may be
differences between firms in their potential and ability to capture that value for
18

themselves based on their bargaining power or exclusive resources and knowledge,
leading to situations where one firm may be more capable of capturing value from
others or capturing it from the market (Ritala & Tidström, 2014).
In regard to SME coopetition, studies have shown that SME coopetition based on
mutual benefit and commitment increase firm performance (Morris et al., 2007).
Trust, mutual benefit and commitment are important aspects of maintaining and
achieving successful coopetitive strategies, and the level and intensity of trust can vary
and change over time. Firms must manage both value creation through cooperation
and value appropriation through competition, a challenging task if other firms act
opportunistically. Trust, mutual benefit and commitment must be monitored by the
actors, and they can even implement policies surrounding ethics and strategy to
maintain the social capital gained from coopetition (Thomason et al., 2013).
While the benefits of coopetition are numerous, drawbacks in coopetitive relationships
exist. Mainly that of opportunistic behaviours by an actor or actors of the coopetitive
relationships. Low trust in coopetition can lead to these opportunistic behaviours if the
other actor believes the strategy is a short–term one. Once the actor has achieved the
desired outcome of the coopetitive strategy, it may be tempting to act opportunistically
for one’s own benefit as firms usually try to achieve their goals in as short a time span
as possible (Cygler et al., 2018).
Several tensions can be observed between coopeting partners, with one being the issue
of sharing information to competitors. While competitors will share information, they
must also be able to protect it. This balancing act is difficult to manage and leads to
tensions between the competitors. While the task of separating information is an
organisational task, sharing information, critical to coopetition, is usually done on an
individual level. It is therefore critical that individuals are aware of the coopetitive
principles and can separate firm specific information from that which can be shared
and also create a process of changing the information that is shared (Fernandez &
Chiambaretto, 2016).

19

Firm profitability can also be negatively affected by coopetition. This can be due to
the firms drawing from learning experiences and constraints that hinder or impede the
mindset of the firm. This is mainly due to how firms learn and adapt from coopetition,
and the experience leaves the firm with a particular mindset or routines that can be
hard to change after the fact. If a certain strategy that was effective during coopetition
is applied to other situations, it can have a detrimental effect on the firm if those
strategies are not implemented accordingly (Fernandez & Chiambaretto, 2016).
There is also a risk of having “too much” or “too little” coopetition. While coopetition
can be beneficial in terms of acquiring new capabilities, opportunities and resources,
firms should carefully manage this in the future. It is thus important to set boundaries
when engaging in coopetition so as not to affect company performance (M. Crick,
2019).
Managing value creation and consequently value appropriation, how the value created
in coopetition is split among the actors, can lead to tensions. This is potential drawback
since it can create hostility between actors and is hard to manage (Ritala & Tidström,
2014).
Further, coopetition can create environments where firms lock themselves out of other
cooperative relationships as they try to protect their own interests and resources.
Coopetitive partners may thus isolate themselves, to the detriment of further
development and innovation capabilities in other cooperative relationships (Cygler et
al., 2018).

2.1.4

Theories of coopetition

This thesis uses the resource–based theory perspective, and this next section reviews
the basic premise of it for coopetition between firms. Coopetition theory stems from
traditional theory on competition and cooperation, namely, game theory, transaction
cost economics, network theory and the resource–based view (Zgarni, 2019). This
thesis uses a view on coopetition as explained by the resource–based view.

20

Resource–based view
The resource–based view suggest that firms can gain a competitive advantage from
the unique resources that they have. For coopetition this refers to working with
competitors to gain resources that would otherwise be out of reach for the firm
(Bengtsson et al., 2016). By collaborating with each other, firms access each other’s
resources for additional rent generation, however how the value is shared between the
firms is not addressed by the resource–based view (Czakon & Dana, 2013). These
resources can include knowledge, assets and skills. These resources are not only
important for firms to gain a competitive advantage but also in the internationalisation
process. This is especially true for SMEs that often lack certain resources and thus
seek coopetitive relationships to take advantage of the other firms resources
(Jankowska, 2015). This view gives a good idea of how coopetition can be more
beneficial for firms than just cooperating and also how innovation capabilities increase
(Ritala & Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2009).
The resource–based view (RBV) of a firm explains how sustained competitive
advantage can be gained from the firms internal resources. The basic premise of RBV
states that firms achieve sustained competitive advantages through its resources and
capabilities and an organisation that can support them (Kraaijenbrink et al., 2010).
RBV assumes that these capabilities arise from firms having “rare, imperfectly
imitable, and not substitutable” (Barney et al., 2001, p. 625) resources and capabilities.
The use of complementary resources gained through acquisitions has been shown to
improve the performance of firms, in comparison to gaining similar resources.
Strategic alliances, such as described by coopetition, are also an effective way of
gaining complementary resources since forming alliances requires less investment and
long–term commitments than acquisitions (Barney et al., 2001). Firms in alliances
each have a set of shared resources and non–shared resources, and in cases where these
resources intersect the alliance has shared resources that can give them a better
competitive opportunity, called a pooling alliance. A complementary alliance involves
firms with low amounts of shared resources that try to achieve a competitive position
by utilising resources that are hard to get for one firm alone (Lavie, 2002).

21

Further, RBV has highlighted the required resources needed for new market entry and
overcoming foreignness when internationalising as well as what resources are needed
for

diversification

in

products

and

internationalisation.

Experience

in

internationalisation among managers can be seen as a resource for firms (Barney et
al., 2001).
The resource–based view explains how small firms in fragmented industries use
coopetition to gain better competitive advantages. It suggests that small firms engage
in coopetition for higher trust and mutual benefits as well as commitment. RBV also
rationalises the desire for small firms to engage in coopetition for scale and scope due
to lack of internal capabilities that are more commonly found in bigger firms
(Thomason et al., 2013).

2.1.5

Antecedents and initiation of coopetition

The compatibility of firms planning to engage in coopetitive relationships is important
for its success. It is however difficult for firms to contact and initiate an offer for a
strategic coopetitive relationship (Blanka & Traunmüller, 2020). Making a bad
selection at the start of the relationship can be detrimental to its success and it is
therefore important to analyse and assess the other firm as well as assessing risk
factors. A firm must take into consideration the learning outcomes desired from the
relationship as well as the process itself. There must also be a good level of harmony
between the partners so as to reduce the risk of opportunistic behaviour and risk
assessments of what the partners weak points are (Cummings & Holmberg, 2012).
Research on critical success factors of coopetition show that synergy, trust, experience
and learning, standardisation and adaptability are important for coopetition.
Cooperation is also shown to be important for innovativeness through resource sharing
and overcoming resource limitations especially for small businesses (de Resende et
al., 2018). Trust is an essential part of initiating successful coopetitive strategies, as
well as making a person visible for other companies (Blanka & Traunmüller, 2020).
Previous research has identified the antecedents that lead up to coopetitive
relationships. These say that trust, experience from previous coopetition and
22

orientation are important aspects of forming coopetitive relationships (Czakon et al.,
2020). SMEs also more regularly engage in spontaneous and reactive coopetition that
start when a firm is referred to by another firm with a customer who has a certain
request (Thomason et al., 2013). The formation of “unintentional” coopetitive
relationships has also been attributed to geographical closeness of the competing firms
(Kylänen & Rusko, 2011). Coopetitive relationships may also be initiated by cultural
or socio–environmental values (Lundgren-Henriksson, 2017).
The propensity to enter coopetitive relationships relies on certain personality traits of
managers, namely agreeableness and neuroticism. Coopetitive relationships form
when other firms view individuals they want to cooperate with as agreeable,
improving teamwork. If the individual is neurotic, the willingness to cooperate is
decreased. However, willingness to work with other individuals regardless of their
agreeableness is sometimes outweighed by the benefits that can be achieved from the
coopetitive relationship (Geraudel & Salvetat, 2014).

2.2 Drivers of Coopetition in SMEs
Due in part to their size, SMEs are vulnerable to economic fluctuation. Factors such
as the high rate of technological advancement, cost of research and development,
limited market presence and limited access to human, social and financial resources
also contribute to vulnerability among SMEs when compared to larger companies.
Coopetition is a strategy that can be attractive for SMEs in overcoming these
vulnerabilities (Gast et al., 2019). Cooperating reduces resource demand on the
individual firm and also alleviates liability of newness that often plague small firms
(Thomason et al., 2013). Research has shown that SMEs need to enter into coopetitive
relationships to achieve economies of scale and increased R&D efficiency (Feela,
2020).
Coopetition offers SMEs the benefits of both cooperation and competition and can
increase their performance both financially and on the market if trust and commitment
are managed well in the SME (Levy et al. 2003). Cooperation allows the firm to access

23

resources and technologies that would not otherwise be available. Competition
challenges both businesses to innovate and keeps creative tensions alive. According
to Ritala (2012), this strategy is more beneficial to the firm rather than having a purely
cooperative partnership.
Gast (2017) notes the social aspect of coopetitive relations in their study on family–
owned SMEs. The harmony established between the competitive SMEs developed
into friendships and thus a higher level of trust, allowing the firms to engage more
productively in activities such as supply chain management, innovation, technology
and employee development, transfer of knowledge and marketing (Gast, 2017). The
development of social connections and networks drives the development of skills and
knowledge within small firms (Thomason et al., 2013).
Coopetition in especially small firms relies on their individual capability and desire to
be active in the relationship and to also contribute with their own resources. However,
coopetition largely relies on the strategic fit of the firms (Lindström & Polsa, 2016).
As mentioned before, coopetition in SMEs can be initiated rather spontaneously for
reasons that relate to lack of resources, lack of knowledge and complex social and
relational characteristics (Thomason et al., 2013).
Gast et al. (2019) outline that the drivers of coopetition in SMEs are to improve market
position, develop competitiveness against other businesses and to develop and
advance interpersonal relationships. The SMEs in their study made a conscious effort
to cooperate to better compete in a growing and more intense market. The
competitiveness increased by joining individual competencies that would not have
been otherwise noticed on the market. The SMEs market power increased by being
able to approach bigger suppliers, hence strengthening their position towards these
suppliers by more effectively negotiating for example pricing, process management
and supplier strategy development. Another driver of SME coopetition is access to
skilled labour. SMEs are at a disadvantage when it comes to affording skilled labour
and by sharing knowledge between the firms, they can overcome this disadvantage
(Feela, 2020).

24

SMEs using a coopetitive strategy may gain significantly improved economic
positions for long–term survival of the firms, with Gast et al. (2019) citing economic
efficiency, sustainability and profitability as important aspects that are improved.
These may be improved through more efficient purchasing activities and discounts, as
well as cooperating on projects that would otherwise be too expensive for a single
firm. Incentives lead to an increase in the attractiveness of the relationship, especially
for SMEs that often face resource constraints. Firms may refer customers to other
firms and thus may receive incentives from the other partner in return (Thomason et
al., 2013).
In their study, Kock et al. (2010), noted that the SMEs that engage in coopetition in a
network of several businesses (four in the case of the study) did not see the other
businesses in their network as direct competitors. The definition of a competitor can
vary depending on whether the customer sees them as competitors, if the researchers
consider them competitors or if the firm itself sees the network actors as competitors.
The definition of competitors is presented by Bengtsson and Kock (2000, p. 415) as
“actors that produce and market the same products” or an actor whose products
increase the value of your own product from the perspective of the customer. The firm
researched in the study mentioned that the firms are focused on the same area with
each having different specialisations. Competition is present in the network, but the
firms prefer to cooperate to reap the benefits from finding new opportunities to pursue
and develop (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).
The other firms in the network act as references to each other since they may have a
stronger foothold in a market where the other firms brand may be relatively unknown.
In terms of internationalisation, the business will rely on the “reputation-related
resources” (Kock et al., 2010 p. 119) that the other business gives in the
internationalisation process. These can relate to image and reputation of the other firm,
and the internationalising firm will take advantage of this strong reputation.

25

2.3 SME internationalisation and coopetition
SMEs are increasingly becoming more active in international markets, despite
challenges associated with SME internationalisation related to, for example, market
share, reputation and resource scarcity and less extensive networks (Brochado et al.,
2020).
SME internationalisation has often been described through the incremental process.
The incremental process states that SMEs gradually expand into similar markets with
close geographical proximity, as explained by the Uppsala Model (Brochado et al.,
2020). The notion of the born global firm started further research into how networks
affect SME internationalisation and eventually led to the revision of the Uppsala
model (Morais & Ferreira, 2020). The network approach argues that SMEs form
networks to tap into each other’s resources, and thus speed up the internationalisation
process. The resource–based view has also informed SME internationalisation
theories. The RBV theory suggests that firms rarely have the required intrafirm
resources needed to internationalise alone, and thus team up with foreign partners
(Bowen, 2019).
The SME internationalisation process has often been described through three different
approaches. The incremental approach and network approach describe the classical
approach to SME internationalisation, often named as the Uppsala Model and the
Innovation Model (Bowen, 2019). The contrasting theory, the international
entrepreneurship perspective, assumes that SMEs are Born Globals (BG) or even
Born–Again–Global (BAG), and seek to internationalise right at their inception by
employing their resources and product sales to gain a competitive advantage, and often
employ informal structures towards internationalisation as compared to their larger
counterparts (Morais & Ferreira, 2020).
Some of the drivers of SME internationalisation process are human capital, technology
and access to networks and institutions (Brochado et al., 2020). Networking through
trade shows also showed a positive correlation in network development and thus
operational performance (Gerschewski et al., 2020). Barriers to internationalisation

26

also exist. These can be categorised into external barriers, such as bureaucracy,
regulations and laws. The internal barriers relate to costs for the internationalisation
process that often decrease profit margins, and for example the time it takes to
internationalise (Brochado et al., 2020).
Drawing from the perspective of the resource–based view, firms that possess certain
resources can gain sustainable competitive advantages by entering strategic new
markets (Feela, 2020). On the other hand, firms that lack financial resources may
struggle to enter the market. To overcome this disadvantage, the firm may enter a
coopetitive relationship (Thomason et al., 2013).
Despite many challenges and risks associated with the internationalisation process, an
increasing number of SMEs engage in internationalisation. SMEs can as a way to
mitigate these risks join alliances or cooperate with other companies to gain resources
not otherwise available to them. For instance, one of the first steps in
internationalisation is “finding and seizing opportunities abroad” (Kock et al., 2010,
p. 111), which may be difficult without sufficient resources.
In a study by Jankowska (2011) a positive correlation between coopetition and
internationalisation emerges. The author states that small firms employing less than
50 people showed the most enthusiasm for using coopetition in internationalisation
activities, again highlighting the need to pool resources and that it may be easier to
develop personal relationships that can improve firm performance as compared to
large firms.
An increase in exporting activity between SMEs that coopete can also be seen
(Jankowska, 2010; Galdeano-Gómez et al., 2016), as well as an increase in their ability
to sell to new markets. Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2016) also show that the interactive
effects of coopetition are positively correlated to firms international marketing. The
same author states that internationalisation is a driver of SME coopetition.
The international cooperation between businesses allows them to access distribution
networks and international contacts which helps increase their activities
internationally. In some cases, cooperating businesses can take advantage of the
27

partners retail and even become a major customer to that business. Companies that
have engaged in coopetition have noted that it opens up new opportunities that may
not have otherwise been available and that the internationalisation would have been
significantly more difficult had they done it by themselves (Kock et al., 2010).

2.4 Summary of theoretical chapter
To summarise, coopetition is the simultaneous cooperative and competitive
interaction between firms (Bengtsson et al., 2016) that, through deliberate effort,
attempt to increase the market size and in turn increase appropriated value for the
individual firm (Gerschberger, 2019). Coopetition combines the rent–seeking skills
and processes that firms apply to gain a competitive advantage with cooperation that
yields resources and knowledge, for example joint R&D, that would otherwise be
unattainable (Luo, 2007). The cooperative interaction pools resources and makes the
firms stronger together, while the competitive aspect forces the firms to innovate. In
an increasingly competitive global landscape, coopetition offers potential to reap the
benefits of both shared resources and knowledge and improved innovation capability
(Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).
Opportunistic behaviour (Cygler et al. 2018), tensions created from sharing critical
information between firms, reduced firm profitability due to failure to change
processes incurred by coopetition appropriately (Chiambaretto, 2016), managing
value creation and appropriation (Ritala & Tidström, 2014) and isolation (Cygler et
al., 2018) are potential drawbacks of coopetition.
Since the seminal work on coopetition by Brandenburger and Nalebuff (1996) there
has been an increased interest in studying coopetition, a clear definition has yet to be
recognised (Soppe et al., 2014). However, Bengtsson et al. (2016) define coopetition
as a paradoxical relationship, that is either horizontal or vertical, between two or more
competitors that cooperate. This thesis follows this definition.

28

A few theoretical streams have been presented above that explain the theoretical roots
from which coopetition can be viewed, one of which is the resource–based view. The
RBV theory explains how firms engage in coopetition to acquire complementary
resources from their competitors to sustain a competitive advantage, thus explaining
how firms seek coopetitive strategies to overcome certain liabilities and lack of
resources (Thomason et al., 2013).
Mutual trust and benefit as well as commitment are important factors in coopetitive
relations (Bengtsson et al., 2010) and even contribute to higher firm performance in
the case of SMEs (Morris et al., 2007). Trust in a relationship can change in both
intensity and over time, making coopetitive relationships highly dynamic (Thomason
et al., 2013).
However, achieving trust between firms is dependent on finding compatible firms.
Thus, finding suitable companies and initiating a coopetitive relationship can be
challenging (Blanka & Traunmüller, 2020).
Drivers of coopetition in SMEs are liabilities such as newness and smallness. That is,
SMEs are driven to engage in coopetition to gain the benefits of cooperating and
competing at the same time to alleviate liability of smallness, achieve economies of
scale and reduce resource demand (Thomason et al., 2013). In addition, cooperating
allows SMEs to engage in joint R&D, which reduces the large amounts of resources
that are often needed and that SMEs lack, as well as combining knowledge and skills
(Feela, 2020).
The conceptual framework (Figure 1) shows the different stages that coopetitive
partners engage in as well as the outcome of the coopetitive partnership in the case of
internationalising SMEs. Coopetition is initiated between SMEs with mutual and
congruent interests formed by a common motivator and possible strategic fit. The
coopetitive process engages both cooperative and competitive interactions between
the firms in the process of internationalisation, leading to an eventual outcome of
successful market entry. The outcome includes possible future directions of the
coopetitive relationships regarding whether the SMEs continue to engage in
coopetition, influenced by common motivators or opportunistic behaviour on behalf
29

of either firm. During the entire process, the dynamics of trust, commitment and
mutual benefit are at play, affecting the possible outcome of the coopetitive strategy.
This conceptual framework is used in the data analysis based on the abductive
approach to theory building chosen for the study, as the continuous, interactive process
of data collection and theory building integrate into the framework.

Figure 1. Conceptual framework based on coopetition theory presented in the theoretical chapter and data collection process.

With this review of existing coopetition theory, the next chapter introduces the
research approach adopted for this study of how coopetition is used in Finnish SME
internationalisation.

Research Approach

This chapter discusses the methodology and method of the research that is being
conducted, from research philosophy to data collection and analysis. In the beginning
of the research project, it was important to consider several aspects of the research
process that affect the development of research questions and the role of theory
development, among others. Discussing these methods will give the reader a better
picture on how the research progressed and how the final results were achieved.

3.1 Research Strategy
The research strategy concerns the general approach to the research project,
particularly the philosophical assumptions that make up the research design and
research questions. These in turn affect the way in which the research questions are
answered and what part theory plays in the study.

3.1.1

Abductive Approach

The choice of theory type reflects the “relationship between theory and research”
(Bell, Bryman & Harley, 2019, p. 17) and is the methodology of the thesis which plays
an important part of a research project. It is the role of theory and how it develops as
the research project evolves. Including theory in the research project usually requires
a way of looking at what role theory has in the project (Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill,
2019).
The abductive approach has become more popular in business research (Bell et al.,
2019), and is a combination of the deductive and inductive approaches. In the
deductive approach the researcher develops hypotheses based on the theoretical
assumptions in a domain. In the inductive approach the researcher applies their own
findings into the theory (Saunders et al., 2019).

31

The abductive approach, then, moves back and forth between theory and data, giving
the researcher a way to find the best explanation from the collected data and thus a
way to explain a phenomenon and turn these potentially surprising empirical findings
into results (Saunders et al., 2019). The researchers presumptions are in a constant
dialogue between the data from the study and the theory (Bell et al., 2019). The
abductive approach begins when a researcher, even during the initial writing of the
research project, finds a surprising fact and then tries to explain it by adapting
plausible theories, which in turn can lead to new surprises. Findings from the data
collection process would be integrated into the existing conceptual framework (Figure
1). This flexibility has led to many researchers using at least some form of abduction
in their research projects, due to pure induction and deduction being hard to achieve
(Saunders et al., 2019).
The aim of the thesis is to understand why and how something is happening at SMEs.
It is therefore important to be able to reflect on the data that is collected and apply it
to the theory, rather than building assumptions by way of hypotheses on what is
happening at SMEs regarding coopetition and internationalisation. To the same extent,
due to constraints regarding knowledge on coopetition in SMEs, specifically Finnish
SMEs, it is difficult to approach the study by first interviewing SMEs. Saunders et al.,
(2019) call for the selection of an approach to theory development depending on the
nature of the research project, with little standing in the way of having to prefer either
a deductive or inductive approach. This study therefore uses the abductive approach.

3.1.2

Qualitative research

The method used for this study is the qualitative research strategy. Qualitative studies
collect data that is textual or visual as compared to numerical data collected through
quantitative studies (Hair et al., 2020). The qualitative method is usually associated
with an interpretive philosophy that allows the researcher to study subjective and
socially constructed meanings and how they affect the phenomenon being studied
(Saunders et al., 2019).

32

The qualitative research method is well suited for this type of study, where the
opinions of the social interactions of managers and employees is important (Bengtsson
& Kock, 2000). In addition, qualitative methods in business research allows for theory
building by providing rich descriptions of real phenomena. New theory is developed
over time in a repetitive interaction between rich data gathering and conceptual
insights from existing theory (Doz, 2011).
The research design will be covered in the next section. The research design was
chosen based on the criteria set in the above section so that the most appropriate data
collection method can be applied based on the constraints of the study and research
questions.

3.2 Research Design
The research design is concerned with the framework that is used to collect and
analyse data. It takes the elements of the research method that then informs the
framework for generating the evidence to answer the research questions. The research
design also addresses the criteria for evaluation of the study, namely reliability,
replicability and validity.

3.2.1

Multiple–case study design

The case study method is a popular method for business research projects and allows
for a detailed and intensive analysis of the case and is well suited for research project
that ask “how” or “why” about a phenomenon (Ghauri et al., 2020). The case study is
also an analysis of a phenomenon at a specific time and place (Piekkari et al., 2009).
The essence of a case study is to understand that the case itself is an object of interest
that the researcher tries to “provide an in-depth elucidation of” (Bell et al., 2019, p.
63). While many arguments have been brought forward as to what the case study sets
out to do, what its limitations are and how much it can contribute theoretically through

33

generalizability or external validity, the purpose of a case study is to develop deep
understandings of a specific phenomenon’s complexity (Bell et al., 2019).
In international business and internationalisation studies the case method has also been
widely used because of its usefulness in expanding the knowledge of the subject by
combining empirical evidence with established theories (Vissak, 2010).
A case study is also useful in an exploratory setting and in theory building of a
phenomenon with future challenges and unexplored topics (Vissak, 2010).
Coopetition still falls under such a classification according to Bengtsson & Kock
(2014). Studies of this nature are well suited for case studies and has been used in
other studies on coopetition in SMEs (Lindström & Polsa, 2016).
This thesis will look at several Finnish SMEs. Some researchers call it a comparative
case study (Ghauri et al., 2020), and the same authors mention how the comparative
case study allows the thesis to explore different dimensions of the phenomenon.
According to Bell et al. (2019), the multiple–case study improves theory–building
because with two or more cases, the researcher has a better possibility of testing in
which situation a theory holds or not, and new concepts that need further investigation
may arise.

3.3 Case selection and data collection
This section will present the process of contacting SMEs willing to participate in the
study and the process of collecting the data through semi–structured interviews.

3.3.1

Sources

The data collection was carried out by contacting various Finnish SMEs and people
working in SMEs. Finding companies was done by searching on sites like Business
Finland that has a directory of Finnish companies in various categories. Once a

34

company or person was found, an email was sent. The email contained information on
the study and its purpose and asked if the company or person would be interested in
participating, highlighting the possibility of remaining anonymous in the study as
some people might be reluctant to reveal their company strategy. This first method
proved quickly to be quite ineffective, partly due to the COVID crisis that had
companies thinking of other things and also summer holidays, and they were also quite
impersonal as they were sent to a general email for the business.
The second strategy involved being quite aggressive in asking people to participate,
and to send messages directly to people in various companies. The amount of people
contacted was also approached aggressively to ensure that there would be an adequate
number of responses and participants, even if the percentage of people who answered
out of the total contacted was low. Additionally, personal contacts were asked to gauge
their interest in participating in the study. The personal contacts came mainly from
Aleksandra Karima at Hivemind Consulting, who helped suggest professionals to
contact and formulating messages that would gauge interest in the individual to
increase the chances of them participating in the study. This method involved using
LinkedIn, a popular social media platform for professionals to network and share ideas
and thoughts. This platform also allowed for a relatively easy method of contacting
people in a company, and many people could be contacted in a short amount of time
as compared to using email. This method established a direct and personal contact to
the person, leading to more answers.
Bell et al. (2019) mention how gaining access to managers may be difficult in
qualitative interviewing. This was the experience for this study as well, as many of the
higher–level managers contacted had very busy schedules and were often limited in
the amount of time they could spend on the interview. The data collection process for
case studies is a time intensive effort, as it is challenging to identify, define and get
access to suitable companies that become part of the case study setting (Saunders et
al., 2019).
Coopetition is still a rather unknown subject, which meant that contacting
professionals by asking them to participate in a study about coopetition would not be
effective. The initial message thus mentioned “cooperation with competitors”. This
35

ensured the participants could identify this type of behaviour at their firms and be more
willing to participate.
Contacting professionals through LinkedIn proved to be successful in that it generated
a lot of responses, out of which nine led to interviews. With the exception of the two
cases chosen for the study, the companies were either not engaging in coopetition or
did not fit the aim of the study of studying coopetition for internationalisation and
were thus excluded from the study.
The theory building process influenced the selection of participants based on how well
the participants internationalisation methods fit into the goal of the thesis, in addition
to the fit of the participants coopetitive actions to the theoretical framework that
support research question 1.
The two case companies were chosen based on how well they reflected the research
questions presented and the overall aim of the study. The case companies were also
selected based on their different operational areas and industries. As recommended by
Dooley (2002), the sampling method was chosen based on the individual interviewees
ability to represent the organisations studied for the thesis. The criterion for selection
was also made based on the case companies differentiation from other studies on
coopetition (see e.g Monticelli et al., 2018; Kock et al., 2010).
As the topic of coopetition was not familiar at the case companies, no information
about their coopetitive activities could be found in other sources such as websites. As
such, no secondary–data sources were used for this thesis.
The next section will go over the used data collection method for this thesis.

3.3.2

Semi–structured interviews

A semi–structured interview was chosen for this study. A semi–structured interview
allows the researcher to follow up on questions on their own initiative that can
potentially uncover insightful and unexpected findings (Hair et al., 2020).
36

An interview guide was used for the semi–structured interviews. The interview guide
includes the main topics to be covered during the interview, but the interview may
depart from it slightly when the interviewer recognises topics that may be of further
interest (Bell et al., 2019). The same interview guide was used in all the interviews to
retain the reliability of the study.
With a semi–structured interview, it is necessary to identify themes and key questions
that will guide the interview. The interview guide was thus divided into several themes
and key questions that led the interview in a certain direction (Saunders et al., 2019).
The purpose of the interview guide was to systematically explore each theme with the
participants.
The various interview themes can be seen below (The interview guide can be seen in
Appendix 1):
1. Questions regarding coopetition. How did it form, what are its characteristics
and what are its effects on the business (questions a – i)
2. Questions regarding internationalisation. How did the coopetitive relations
affect the internationalisation of the business (questions a – c)
3. Other comments regarding coopetition and internationalisation

3.3.2.1 Pilot interview
To ensure that the questions were relevant and could be understood by people in the
industry, two pilot interviews were conducted. One with a CEO of an SME in the
Turku region and another interview with a professional working with networking,
entrepreneurial activities like business model testing and internationalisation
activities, also from the Turku region. The initial interview guide was also sent to a
professional in internationalisation consulting to ensure that the questions were clear
and understandable from the perspective of entrepreneurs and business owners. The
interview questions were simplified, and the chance of questions overlapping each
other minimised by removing similar questions.

37

3.3.2.2 Interviews
The final interviews were conducted with two case companies. Each interview was
recorded for transcription. Table 1 shows each interview and their duration. The case
companies are anonymous to ensure that certain business strategies are not revealed.

3.4 Data analysis
This study uses a thematic analysis approach to data analysis. The purpose of a
thematic analysis is to search for themes in a series of interviews (Saunders et al.,
2019). A theme is a category that is identified by the researcher and relates to the
research questions and is derived from the data collected. These themes build the
foundation for a theoretical contribution. When looking for a theme the researcher
looks for certain things in the data. These include, among others, repetitions,
metaphors and analogies, similarities and differences between the collected data and
theory–related material, as listed by Bryman (2016). This thesis uses an abductive
approach which means the data analysis starts by looking at theoretically driven
themes which are then modified and added to further into the data analysis stage
(Saunders et al., 2019).

38

Both interviews were in Swedish, as well as transcribed into Swedish. The interviews
were transcribed right after the interviews were held. Due to the length of the
interviews, a process of data sampling was used. Data sampling allows transcription
of the audio that is pertinent to the research questions and study. In data sampling the
researcher listens to the entire recording and selectively chooses the important parts
for the study. It is still important to listen carefully and transcribe parts that the
researcher assumes might be relevant so as not to miss anything that could contribute
to the study. It is thus important to go back and relisten to the audio recording several
times (Saunders et al., 2019).
Using the interview transcriptions, the data analysis started by coding the data to
identify key words, recurring subjects and repetitions. Themes were constructed
around the research questions to be answered in the thesis. Broad categories were
established first, highlighted by recurring topics and words that the interviewee used.
These could be themes surrounding the motives for coopetition, initiation process or
results of coopetition. The broad themes were categorised, after which followed a
process of looking at the data in more detail to form subcategories that related more
specifically to how the relationships were initiated, what the characteristics were and
under what circumstances they were formed, what underlying motives contributed to
forming the coopetitive relationship and what the specific results of coopetition for
internationalisation were. There was also a process of forming a timeline in how
coopetition was developed that translated into how the analysis was structured;
initiation, motives and finally results of coopetition. Each case was examined
individually so as to be treated as a single case, as recommended by Dooley (2002).
However, in the final conclusions, the cases are also compared to highlight interesting
commonalities or differences.

3.5 Reliability and validity
Bryman (2016) states that validity and reliability measurements are not always
suitable for qualitative studies in their original form from quantitative studies which
often assume a single correct truth in a social context, when in reality there can be

39

several reasonable explanations to a social phenomenon. This thesis thus uses the
reliability and credibility criteria as mentioned by Bell et al. (2019) that are better
suited for qualitative research. These are trustworthiness and authenticity.
Trustworthiness has four criteria, namely credibility, transferability, dependability
and confirmability.
The data collected for the study were sufficient to build an accurate construction of
the phenomenon, in addition to following up with questions that emerged from the
data analysis process. The results were also discussed with the mentor of the thesis,
ensuring its credibility.
The process of selecting participants of the study was explained, with the changes in
the process mentioned in earlier parts of the study. The focus of the research changed
slightly during the course of the study based on the interviewee responses when it
became clear that explaining how coopetitive relations are managed within SMEs
could not be sufficiently explained from the interviews alone and restrictions in time
for the study. Instead, the focus shifted towards understanding the initiation process
of coopetition, which both interviewees had enough information and direct experience
on. This is mentioned to aid dependability of the study that ensures the changes made
are recorded as the research progressed (Saunders et al., 2019).
The transferability of the study aims to ensure the reader that the results of the study
are transferable to another setting, possibly for the purposes of further research. The
research questions, research design and strategy, results and discussion are detailed to
allow for the possibility to transfer the study to other settings. However, keeping in
mind that a qualitative case study focuses on gaining rich detail about a specific
context which makes it unique and significant for the phenomenon being studied (Bell
et al., 2019).
The study attempts to ensure the dependability by giving the reader a possibility to
audit the study based on the documentation of the research process, including problem
formulation, selection of interviewees, interview questions and data analysis process
(Bell et al., 2019). These processes have been documented in this thesis and an attempt
has been made to make the process as transparent as possible.
40

In regard to confirmability, any possible bias towards the interviewees, case
companies or results has been, to the best of the researchers ability, removed from this
thesis. While absolute objectivity is hard to achieve, the researcher has approached the
source selection, data gathering and ensuing analysis impartially. The researcher also
had no previous connection to the case companies, and the case companies were
chosen randomly from a group of suitable participants who engaged in coopetition for
their internationalisation process. It can be said, however, that the researcher made
some assumptions on the nature of the competitive relationships, as the interviewees
were unfamiliar with the concept of coopetition and thus referred to it as “cooperation
with competitors”.
This thesis assumes that the theories and findings of the study are one of many
representations of the contextual setting. This means that there may be other equally
correct representations of the phenomena, and that there is not one objectively correct
explanation or answer. This leads to a final criterion authenticity, which requires the
researcher to “fairly represent different viewpoints” (Bell et al., 2019, p. 365) of the
social phenomena.
Following the review of the methodology chosen for this study, the next chapter will
discuss the results of the data gathering process.

Results

This section will introduce the case companies included in the study as well as the
findings from each one. The interviews were carried out with one person from each
case company. The purpose is to identify how each company has used coopetition in
different ways in their operations, and how this has resulted in an increased
internationalisation of their activities.

4.1 Case Companies
4.1.1

Company A

Company A is a manufacturer of wireless communications devices that rely on private
networking to ensure connectivity in mission critical operations that cannot use public
networks that use 3G or 4G technology. Company A is based in Finland and has 70
employees as of 2019. In 2019 their turnover was 19 653 000€ with revenue of
1 094 000€.
While Company A has operated internationally since it was founded, it has started a
more aggressive strategy of targeting customers abroad and is currently expanding to
new international markets and trying to gain a better foothold in existing markets.
Person A at Company A is a director of business development, who says the firm been
focusing on a new strategy that involves working with competitors to gain access to
new markets and customers abroad. While the term coopetition was previously
unfamiliar, Interviewee A was of the opinion that the type of behaviour that would
characterise coopetition does take place and has been getting increased attention as a
potential way to improve the business.
The case involves several ventures into different international markets, and the results
discuss these cases.

42

4.1.2

Company B

Company B is an innovator in the housing construction industry, offering a product
that allows customers to quickly build housing with prefabricated bricks. The material
used in the brick is an ecological bio composite derived from wood fibres that are by–
products of the forest industry and recycled plastic, making the product a good
sustainable solution compared to concrete and other traditional materials. The bricks
are made in injection moulds in local factories, making the process quick and cheap
as well as being able to provide the local economy with jobs. The block house is
designed to be very quick to build with minimal tools and can be carried out by almost
anyone. The house can also be dismantled quickly and moved. A 30m2 house can be
built in a few hours.
Company B is still a very young company in the start–up phase and is not yet
profitable, showing a loss of 154 000€ in 2019 due in part to the initial investment into
the machines and injection moulds. However, the company is in a high growth phase
with a lot of interest from individuals and governments all over the world. The
business model builds on licensing agreements, with Company B taking a small
royalty per brick made. The company has built a few factories in Africa and is aiming
at opening new ones in South America and Southeast Asia.

4.2 Coopetitive relationship initiation
Company A
The initial talk on a cooperative strategy took place when Company A was approached
by another company regarding forming a joint venture to sell their products abroad.
Even though both firms recognised that they are competitors in the industry, they
wanted to cooperate. The discussion took place in a casual setting between the CEOs
of the respective companies as they were previous acquaintances. The other company
had started discussions with a potential representative in Indonesia but stated that
having to take 100% of the cost would be high. As such, it was more beneficial to
share the costs 50 – 50 with someone else, and thus they decided to approach Company

43

A. The relationship started in the beginning of 2017. Had it not been for the casual
lunch meeting, the relationship might not have started at all.
The coopetitive relationship was set up to acquire sales in the local electricity
distribution infrastructure. The core business of Company A is wireless
communication while the other company’s core business is wired fibre
communication. While the firms offer different types of communication, the customer
faces a choice between adopting wireless or wired communication, essentially making
them competitors as the customer can choose either technology for their product or
infrastructure.
Company A is working together with a university in the U.S. and Business Finland to
develop a market penetration plan that involves working with partners and other
manufacturers in the U.S. This process looks at the entire company and at what kind
of partners it wants and needs. The target is manufacturers of heavy machinery and
establishing contacts with suppliers to these manufacturers. The suppliers are other
radio communications manufacturers, and by partnering with them the hope is to get
into the ecosystem of delivering radio devices to big U.S. based customers.
Interviewee A also mentioned how a relationship developed when the competitor
noticed that Company A had won contracts with some of the competitor’s big
customers. In this case it became a matter of choosing whether to remain purely a
competitor or to cooperate. Company A had modules that could be integrated into the
competitors product and they both saw greater benefits in working together. This
would offer completely new markets and possibilities for both companies. The
initiation of the relationship was further helped by the fact that the competitor was a
firm with similar age, size and turnover.
Company B
Initiating the coopetitive partnership by Company B was achieved by simply
approaching other companies and asking them if they want to cooperate. Interviewee
B says it is also very upfront and open about its plans for entering a market, and other
companies that hear about these plans contact it and want to be involved. In this way
it is a fairly informal process of engaging in coopetitive relationships. Company B
44

simply wants to help these other companies with good solutions to reach new markets
by coordinating trips, reaching out to companies and making it easy for other
companies to find information about what Company B is doing in regard to the
internationalisation aspect its business.
For many other companies it could be seen as a threat, bringing along other
competitors that can possibly steal customers, but Company B says it invites these
types of cooperative strategies. It is also financially beneficial, as going together
allows the companies to share costs and parts associated with the building process.

4.3 Coopetitive relationship drivers
Company A
Company A has for a while been contemplating about changing its approach towards
competitors. Competitors are now seen as potential partners as the technologies could
be combined. This change was spurred by the fact that the customers demanded as
close to 100% network uptime as possible. This could be more easily achieved by
combining the two competing technologies, wired and wireless, and together offer the
customers a better product instead of trying to compete on exclusive contracts.
The interviewee mentioned that the company had a country representative that was
nearing retirement and considering selling the company. The prospect of giving
sensitive information to someone one could not trust was not an attractive option.
Working together with another company to identify a country representative who
could be trusted was seen as a good opportunity to continue and further develop
operations in Indonesia and neighbouring countries. After further discussions with the
representative, a Finnish native, Company A decided to go ahead with the
arrangement. Having someone with local knowledge is seen as an advantage, as local
regulations and bureaucracy constitute a significant barrier.
As an SME, the interviewee mentioned the company’s limited ability to expand and
develop operations abroad beyond those that are ongoing at the moment. For example,

45

it wants to expand into South America but has to prioritize resources and develop a
strategy that focuses on current objectives and already entered markets. The
opportunity with the other company to pursue internationalisation in Indonesia
requires locking down resources for that specific activity.
Both companies had congruent strategies which allowed them to work together in a
coopetitive relationship. Additionally, both needed a representative in the country, and
sharing the costs for this representative was seen as significant benefit for Company
A. In this case, the strategy of each company lined up with each other, with the
additional benefit of sharing costs.
Company B
Company B has an ambitious strategy for entering new markets all over the world.
The demand for cheap, quick and easy building methods is high, especially in
developing markets such as in Africa and Southeast Asia. To offer better solutions the
company has started several partnerships with other firms in the construction industry.
Two companies in Uganda and Kenya are using Company B’s technology to build
houses. Company B has partnered with a few competitors for the Namibian market,
bringing these competing building technology companies with them.
Company B realised that even if it opened 10 or more factories in Namibia to produce
building blocks, it still would not meet the demand. There is a big gap that Company
B alone cannot fill, and thus it has decided to go into the market with a coopetitive
strategy. One of the motives for this coopetitive strategy was to simply help bring
other firms into the Namibian and other markets. Interviewee B says:
“I believe that you should help out if you can when you see that the market is so big
that you can be successful and stronger together” – Interviewee B
The firms cooperate on for example building model houses and logistics, but the end
customer chooses which construction technology to adopt. According to the
interviewee, holding building exhibitions with several companies makes the process
and possibilities to attract more customers more consistent, and thus a net positive for
all companies involved even if they are competitors.
46

Company B also wants to help competing firms to internationalise as they may be in
a worse position to internationalise because of, for example, lack of language skills. If
a competing firm does not have the ability to do business in English, Company B
wants to help in the internationalisation process by bringing the competitor along and
improving its chances. Interviewee B mentions that the firms attitude towards
competitors is indeed quite strange in the sense that it believes that if there is space on
the market for an attractive product, it wants to help other firms capitalise on it as well.
Company B sees this strategy as a positive for itself, supporting and strengthening its
own activities.
Company B is a small company with a new product, and it is thus difficult to enter or
to even explore new markets and possibilities. Having contacts in similar companies
with similar ambitions and strategies can really help to establish new contacts and
customers when working together.
One example of why Company B is so strongly motivated to cooperate with other
firms is getting access to the UNs budget for construction products. The UN spends
about €13,8 billion on construction products annually. Denmark sells around €500
million worth of construction products to the UN annually, and according to
Interviewee B, the success is explained by and depends on commonly occurring inter–
firm cooperation in the industry. The other Nordic countries sell about €20 million
worth of construction products to the UN annually. Interviewee B mentions that this
type of cooperation between competing firms needs to become more common in the
other countries as well including making marketing, sales and the overall effort more
consistent.
“When you have a large volume [of companies] that come with their suggestions, that
is when you enter the market. And that is what we have to start thinking about now.
We are stronger together, going at it alone is not enough. It is just not attractive in
that way” – Interviewee B

47

4.4 Results of the coopetitive relationship for internationalisation
Company A
Interviewee A mentions that the cooperative relationship in regard to the Indonesian
market has not directly made the firm more competitive on the market, but that the
relationship has given them more access to the customers which in turn has improved
market presence and awareness among customers.
“If we think about southeast Asia, it is more about getting access to the customers.
Once we get access to the customers we do not have as much use from the other
company.” – Interviewee A
The cooperative relationship is important in establishing relevance in that particular
market and getting the right portfolio of contacts.
The interviewee also states that getting into the Indonesian market, and specifically
into business with the local state–owned electricity network distributor, would have
been impossible without the cooperative effort. Company A shared part of the
equipment installed at the power stations with the other firm, but eventually the
customer decided that only the wireless technology provided by Company A would
be installed at some stations. Thus, Company A essentially beat the cooperative
partner on some locations in Indonesia as the customers realized that wireless
technology would be sufficient in some cases.
“They [customer] realized that they have quite a few stations where they would be
installing only our products, and that opened this twist that would not have been
possible any other way. So that has been more or less a success.” – Interviewee A
Another benefit of having a representative in the country itself is that local knowledge
is essential in acquiring new customers or winning contracts. The local knowledge is
of course beneficial in knowing whom to target, reaching out to existing contacts and
staying relevant in discussions between suppliers and customers. Additionally,
knowledge of local regulations and good relations with local authorities is essential,

48

especially in an industry which is very strict on what frequencies can be used by the
network and gaining type approval/certification for the radios. The internationalisation
strategy thus relies on having distributors on location that can communicate the local
restrictions and requirements back to the head office.
The realization that cooperation with competitors is possible developed into a new
business strategy for the company. They now view other firms with competing
technologies as potential partners as customer demands have changed. Having access
to information from other competing firms has allowed Company A to adapt its own
product development and strategies to better match the demand of its bigger customers
that were accessed through competitors.
The U.S. is an important market for the manufacture of heavy “off-highway vehicles”
and other heavy equipment which Company A is targeting. It is also a strategic choice
since Latin America largely follows the U.S., and this would be a potential way into
the Latin American market as well. The interviewee mentions that it is very hard to
get direct access to the U.S. market from Finland but partnering with existing suppliers
may offer an easier route.
The American market and customer base is completely new for Company A, and there
is a steep learning curve since it is not used to working with these types of customers.
Having a partner that is part of the ecosystem of suppliers to the big manufacturers is
seen as a big advantage to gain a foothold in the market and aid product development
to match demands of customers in the U.S.
The competitor of Company A had worked to establish itself in the machinery industry
for a long time and saw an opportunity to focus on core activities by integrating
Company A’s products and relieving some of the pressure on resources. Similarly,
Company A can focus on its core activity and is able, through the partnership, to
establish itself in the ecosystem as a more robust partner and move up in the supply
chain to the big manufacturers to become a direct component supplier. The motivation
here is to gain a foothold in one specific business area of the big manufacturers, for
example Liebherr that this partnership is focused on, and then gain access to other

49

business areas of Liebherr, for example harbour cranes. As the big manufacturers
develop their own products, Company A wants to stay in the loop regarding that
development as well.
“They are developing their solutions at the same time, and we want to be part of that
development more intensely than before to become more of a component supplier, and
that way change our position in the ecosystem” – Interviewee A
Company A has been working on the U.S. market for the last year and a half, focusing
resources mostly on this market. The reason has been to get into the ecosystems, and
it appears to have been successful in opening discussions with partners.
Company A is also developing existing products so that it would be able to offer a
more complete communications “platform” that can be sold directly to the big
manufacturers, eventually skipping other partners. This is a deliberate strategy that
Company A is pursuing, but it relies on working together with other existing radio
communications manufacturers and acting as “subcontractors” until their own
platform is developed enough.
The plan for the coopetitive partnership, according to Interviewee A, is to establish
themselves as a primary supplier, and as it looks today that would involve eventually
ending the partnership at least in its original form. However, to keep confidence and
trust between the partners at the moment, Company A wants to keep these plans
discrete.
Company A has ongoing discussion with the customers and mentions that the situation
may look very different in two or three years if it can become a primary components
supplier and get the partners customers as their own customers. In that case, they will
have to re–evaluate the current partnership and determine how the current partner
would fit in, if at all. The move from being integrated partners to becoming a key
supplier in the customers ecosystem would mean an eventual break–up of the
coopetitive relationship.

50

Company A has a key strategic goal with this coopetitive partnership that cannot
necessarily be communicated to the other partner firm, even if the wish is to be as
honest and open as possible. Going around the partner firm is also relevant for certain
R&D activities with the customer.
Interviewee A mentions that the reasons for this coopetitive partnership are many,
including an opportunity to increase sales by being opportunistic in the relationship,
as well as the lack of resources for certain activities that are alleviated by the
partnership. The technological shift means Company A could offer a complete
connectivity platform instead of individual components, which is a big opportunity.
Lack of resources and direct access to customers is a barrier that has been more easily
overcome by working together and generating revenue which in turn further helps in
the development of their own connectivity platform.
Interviewee A recalls a “friendly competition” developed with a distributor in the U.S.
market: in the event that a customer needs something, and Company A cannot take the
order at that time, it can call the other competitors linked to the distributor and ask
them to help out with the order. Components from Company A would be installed in
the product by the competitor, and thus be delivered to the customer even if the order
was fulfilled by the other firm. Interviewee A said that while they may lose the benefit
of making the entire order themselves, they do not lose out on the share of the profits
they would have had, had they not used the competitor at all.
“Together with that competitor we win the contract in a slightly different way, and
that is quite interesting” – Interviewee A
Person A describes a situation where Company A delivers a certain radio component
to one of their main competitors, as the competitor stopped producing it, turning the
competitor into a major customer. This partnership has also allowed Company A to
improve their own technology to be able to communicate with the competitors
equipment, giving them a stronger position on the market for potential customers that
can choose Company A’s product as a complement to the competitor’s.

51

“Other things we did was we opened the competitors protocol and made it so that our
products communicate with the competitors radios, which is quite rare in this
industry” – Interviewee A
Additionally, since the component made by Company A can be used in other
competitors products as well, an interesting relationship has developed with respect to
a previous competitor. One of the biggest competitors in the U.S. turned into a partner
as well as a customer, and the two firms now have joint product development.
Company A is also selling some of the competitor’s products but branded to match
Company A branding. The other firm was considered a competitor until Company A
realised that it would be more beneficial to focus on core functions and sell their
competitor’s products on its own site in order to give the customer a larger product
range and offering. This relationship was possible because the two companies knew
each other from before, had similar histories of being privately owned and operational
for a relatively long time and had high quality products. These similarities enabled the
cooperative relationship. This specific product line did not do well, and the strategy
pointed the firm in a different direction, so the products are being pulled out.
However, it gives an example of how Company A uses its competitor’s products to
complement its own product line. It was realised that instead of spending five years
on product development when a customer needs the product right away, the
competitor’s product can be used and sold to the customer. While it does not offer any
significant turnover or profit, it does allow them to get “a foot between the door” with
these customers. This develops relations that would not necessarily otherwise have
been possible. Interviewee A comments on this relationship by saying:
“It opens new opportunities for us, for our own assortment of products and our own
solutions and services. The business opens up for us again so we cannot only look at
how many euros we get from these products since it is much more than what the sales
figures show” – Interviewee A
This means that new business opportunities arise for the company’s own products even
when it just sells the other competitors products to the customer, but at a later date.
52

Looking at the sales figures of the products does not give an accurate depiction of the
success of this kind of strategy, since it leads to more business in the long run. This
strategy has also presented some opportunities abroad, but its scope and scale are
unknown.
The interviewee confirms that cooperation with this competitor has helped them
internationalise. However, results vary from case to case. Some cases have helped
open doors in new markets, while other cases have been deliberate strategies to go into
a new market with a competitor.
Company B
For the case of Company B, bringing competing firms along provides more options
for the customers and offers the possibility of offering solutions that best fit the
customer’s needs. For example, in Onipa, Namibia, Company B is sharing a location
where eight different buildings are being constructed by four companies. All the
companies invite people and representatives of organisations and local governments
to view the different options. Having several options available makes the trip more
attractive for the customers compared to if there was only one option. It essentially
diversifies the options available, which according to Interviewee B gives the customer
a bigger reason to visit the location. The interviewee mentions an example of setting
up an exhibition in Jakarta. Contacting ministries, media and other stakeholders is
much easier when you have several companies showing products making it more
interesting for example for organisations looking to provide affordable housing as well
as ensuring better media coverage.
“If you are an individual building company that invites 100 people, and then you have
10 companies that invite 10,000 people it has a completely different meaning” –
Interviewee B
Cooperating makes all the competing companies stronger when approaching
organisations and the government.
Another result of coopetition for Company B regards approaching the United Nations.
Cooperating with its competitors allows Company B to get in contact with them more
53

easily, especially working with Business Finland to organise seminars on topics
regarding affordable and sustainable housing for developing markets. Interviewee B
mentions that few are interested when a single company wants to showcase their
product. However, when approaching a customer with several different solutions it
becomes more worthwhile for both the customer and the companies, and this is where
Company B has seen the most useful application of coopetition. However, this does
bring along more competitors for Company B to compete with.
It is up to each company to be confident in their own solution, coopetition drives
development and consequently produces a better product in the long term. Interviewee
B mentions how they see competition as a positive as it pushes them to improve their
own product. Engaging in joint internationalisation efforts bring these competitors
together physically as well which allows them to observe what the competitors are
doing. Having access to competitor’s products gives new ideas for improvement and
also insight into what the customer prefers and wants.
“If you have competitors then you try to do your best to ensure that the customer
chooses you. In a way you are living on the edge, where you have to make the product
better and better to convince the customer to choose your product, and you are
stronger together” – Interviewee B
Cooperating also creates a support network that each company can rely on in case of
problems and further development, seeing what works and what does not for particular
customers.
Sharing costs is also an important aspect of working together in entering and exploring
new markets. Company B says they want to help competitors out of pure goodwill,
but the benefit of having joint internationalisation with competitors is sharing costs
associated with getting new customers and internationalisation, as well as the building
process itself. Having several companies involved in the process allows them to share
the costs of for example pouring concrete foundations for the houses.
In the coopetitive process, Company B has emerged as a leader that brings other
companies along in the internationalisation process. It communicates its strategies and
54

invites other competing companies that show interest to join in on the effort. The
interviewee mentions that while the effort sometimes falls short of expectations or
fails for the cooperative partner, the company knows that is has done what it can and
achieved some of the aspects it set out to do with the coopetitive relationship.
Regarding trust with the competitors, Interviewee B says that they of course need to
be careful and avoid sharing too much information regarding the product. However,
sharing information about potential plans and projects, especially regarding
internationalisation is not seen as a problem. There is also an issue of trusting
especially smaller competitors that may not have the resources to do cooperative
projects internationally or to get started on some of the projects. It becomes a task of
making sure that competitors are not taking advantage of the assistance of the other
companies but not contributing anything themselves. To tackle this issue, Company B
establishes consortiums of companies that will pool resources and help each other
organize building exhibitions in new potential markets. Each company pays an initial
fee of 5000€ to join the project. This gives an indication of who is serious about joining
the project and avoids “drag along” companies that want to simply take advantage of
the resources and connections the other companies are providing.
The results of the interviews from the case studies have been presented above. An
analysis of the data gathered will follow this chapter, linking it to the theoretical
foundations introduced in chapter 2.

55

5

Analysis

This chapter will analyse the findings and results while linking them to previous
literature.
The results show that the initiation of coopetitive relationships is likely to form
between firms that are similar in nature regarding size and operational history.
However, the results showed that the actors in the coopetitive relationships do not
always have to be located in the same geographical area, as shown by Company A’s
arrangement with a competitor in the U.S and Company B’s cooperation with
competitors located throughout Europe. In the case of Company B, the relationships
were initiated on an informal basis, in contrast to the notion that informal relationships
occur based on geographical closeness or regional influences (Kylänen & Rusko,
2011).
Interviewee A mentioned that the informal meeting between managers of the two
companies resulted in the success of the coopetitive relationship, and consequently
their internationalisation in Indonesia. This highlights how informal meetings, such as
lunch meetings between former associates, can lead to the formation of coopetitive
relationships between SMEs. The interviewee mentioned how the managers had a high
level of trust between them, having worked together previously and that there was a
generally high level of trust between the companies when working together. Trust
between firms engaging in coopetition is frequently mentioned as one of the critical
success factors for coopetition (Morris et al., 2007; Thomason et al., 2013).
Company B started several coopetitive relationships based on being open and
communicative of their plans and inviting other companies to join them, even going
as far as identifying companies that may struggle to internationalise because of
language or resource constraints and help them in this regard. Agreeableness has been
described as influencing whether coopetitive relationships are formed (Geraudel &
Salvetat, 2014), and while the study cannot directly attribute agreeableness to the
formation of these coopetitive relationships, it may be said that having managers that

56

are open and willing to help can be an important factor behind forming these
coopetitive relationships.
In both cases, lack of resources to enter a market or lack of knowledge were seen as
challenges to internationalisation that were solved by forming these coopetitive ties
with other firms, mentioned as a driver for coopetition in studies of coopetition in
SMEs (Gast et al., 2019). Sharing the cost of recruiting in Indonesia was seen as an
attractive option for Company A. They further entered into coopetitive relationships
with a competitor in the U.S. that allowed them to have more efficient R&D that would
match the demands of the customer, which is in line with Feela (2020) who says that
SME coopetition increases R&D efficiency. Acting as a supplier and working together
with their competitor to develop new products allowed Company A to access new
knowledge and customers in the U.S, as mentioned by e.g., Blanka & Traunmüller
(2020) who say that coopetition is a way for organisations to gain additional resources,
customers and knowledge.
Company B’s willingness to engage in coopetition can be attributed to the managers’
goodwill. That is, willingness to help other companies and share a large market with
high demand for sustainable and affordable housing in developing countries.
Interviewee B mentioned how the company’s employees are personally highly
motivated to work and cooperate with competitors and think that the company should
help if it is able to. This introduces as new element of engaging in a coopetition
strategy that is based on working together based on goodwill. However, Company B
is also motivated to coopete because of economic incentives and getting access to
competitors products, as well as being able to more directly observe what customers
want if they choose competitors’ products. This allows Company B to quickly adapt
their own processes and end–product to better match the demand of the customers.
Company B is also wary of competitors taking advantage of their goodwill and make
sure competitors contribute thier fair share of, for example, setting up trade shows or
cooperating on building demo houses in a particular area.
Cooperating with their competitors, Company B gained a significantly better
opportunity to approach new customers in new markets, and also in approaching large
organisations like the UN. Cooperating on setting up events where they display their
57

products together attracted more potential customers and allowed them to reach a
larger audience that otherwise would not have been possible. SMEs often face a
liability of newness where they are too unestablished to be seen on the market
(Thomason et al., 2013), which in the case of Company B was alleviated by the fact
that it cooperated with competitors for the trade shows. This would also introduce
some competitive tensions since it is still competing for the same customers. However,
Interviewee B mentioned that this forces the company to continuously improve its own
product and innovate. This type of creative tension is more beneficial for the firm than
engaging in just competition or cooperation, according to Ritala (2012). Company B
was also able to share some of the costs of construction with the other companies.
Company A had used intermediaries, such as Business Finland, to help it connect with
companies abroad who could become partners. Using intermediaries to connect firms
that are a good strategic fit for a coopetitive partnership can be an effective strategy
(Blanka & Traunmüller, 2020). Finding the right coopetitive partner is a challenge for
firms, and by using an intermediary that can connect different firms it may be easier
to identify and select potential strategic partners.
Company A noted how working directly with their competitor for the Indonesian
market was a success in terms of establishing presence in that specific market and also
acquiring new customers, in some cases beating the competitor. Sharing the costs of a
local representative was beneficial for both firms, but even more beneficial was
gaining access to local knowledge and contacts. Further, they managed to enter an
ecosystem of suppliers for large manufacturers in the U.S. and are planning to move
into becoming a primary components supplier, eventually hoping to bypass the
existing coopetitive partner entirely.
Company B has approached their competitors from the perspective of helping them,
and in return gain benefits from cooperating by reducing costs and reaching a larger
audience for their product as well as improving their own product to better compete
with their competitors.

5.1 Comparing the two cases
58

While both firms are engaging in coopetition to increase their international activity,
their strategies and methods vary. Company A is engaging more in what can be called
vertical relationships. These relationships are formed with firms on either end of the
supply chain. The company has established itself as a component supplier with
coopetitive partners that sell similar products to gain presence on the market, in what
can be described as a firm–supplier or firm–subcontractor relationship (Soppe et al.,
2014). In another case, they have partnered with a competitor to share costs and gain
knowledge of the market, which in turn proved to be a successful strategy in terms of
sales to customers in Indonesia.
Company B is engaging in more horizontal relationships for coopetition, partnering
with direct competitors for scope and scale when internationalising. In these
coopetitive relationships, sharing costs and increasing awareness by collaborating,
thus reaching a larger audience, are emphasised.
In both cases the companies formed coopetitive relationships with firms that share
similar traits and characteristics, ensuring a good strategic fit.

Discussion and suggestions for further research

Having analysed the results from the case companies, this chapter focuses on
answering the research questions, highlighting the limitations of the study and
suggesting future research paths.

6.1 Discussion
The following section aims to answer the research questions and give
recommendations for managers.
RQ1: What are the drivers for coopetition that determine an SMEs decision
to internationalise?
Based on the literature review of coopetition, there are several drivers of SME
coopetition in regard to internationalisation.
From the results of the study, it can be argued that the drivers of coopetition in SMEs
are related to reducing costs, improving the products and acquiring contacts and
knowledge in international markets.
This highlights a change in the way companies, specifically for SMEs in this study,
view their competitors. This is in line with the study made by Kock et al. (2010) who
highlight a paradigm shift in how competitors view cooperation in an international
setting. The authors mentioned how coopetition allowed the studied Finnish SMEs to
develop international strategic opportunities that led to increased competitiveness. In
addition, it also confirms the theoretical contributions of Ritala (2012) that mention
how coopetition is “beneficial for a firm’s market and innovation performance (Ritala,
2012, p. 318). The same study mentions how coopetition was beneficial for the Finnish
SMEs included in the study in cases of low competition intensity that stem from firms
being able to enhance and combine their individual capabilities when the situation
allows them to cooperate more than compete, such as in the case of Company B. Both

60

case companies in this study have realised the potential and real benefits of
cooperating with their competitors to overcome certain liabilities related to being an
SME, reaching a larger customer base and acquiring new customers abroad. Company
A created a strategy based around working with competitors to offer more reliability
to customers and to enter ecosystems through competitors that supply large
manufacturers in for example the U.S. Company B adopted an approach based on
goodwill that eventually led to them reaching higher success in international markets.
This study adds to the existing literature on how Finnish SMEs utilize coopetition to
enhance their internationalisation efforts and increased competitiveness in
international markets.

RQ2: How are coopetitive relationships initiated in Finnish SMEs?
The study shows that impersonal connections between firms or their managers can
lead to the formation of coopetitive relationships, in the case of Company A.
Additionally, Company A used intermediaries to find appropriate competitive firms
in the US that led to the formation of coopetition. Company A entered the coopetitive
partnership as a supplier to a U.S. based competitor, who realised that cooperating
would be more beneficial than purely competing. For the case of Company A,
coopetitive relationships were initiated on an informal basis with a competitor who
had a similar challenge of internationalising in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, as well
as through an intermediary who helped them identify a competitor in the U.S.
Company B approached competitors on an informal basis as well, gauging and
attracting interest from similar companies who wanted to internationalise by being
open about their strategy. Company B approached coopetition through goodwill, that
is, realising that the market is big enough that they can help similar companies reach
the same customers. The coopetitive relationship has been a net positive for the
company, as they both reduced their costs and improved their products. Contacts with
firms of similar size and age, with congruent interests, led to the formation of
coopetitive relationships for both Company A and Company B.

61

RQ3: How does coopetition impact Finnish SME internationalisation?
Regarding internationalisation, both companies experienced positive results from
cooperating with their competitors. The coopetitive partnerships reduced costs,
improved their products and gave them access to new customers. As SMEs, both firms
saw benefits of sharing or reducing costs by dividing them with the competitors. This
was reliant on the fact that all actors saw similar benefits which motivated them to
cooperate.
Interviewee A mentioned how, had they not coopeted with the other Finnish SME,
their internationalisation effort in Indonesia would not have been possible. As an SME,
resources are scarce, and having to go at it alone would have been a challenge. Sharing
the costs, and also having a representative with local knowledge of regulations and
also local contacts was an enormous benefit for Company A. While the initial strategy
involved sharing locations with the competing firm, Company A was even able to beat
the competing firm on some locations when the customer saw that implementing
solely their technology was enough for certain locations.
For the U.S. market, Company A was able to establish a foothold with large vehicle
manufacturers through their cooperation with the U.S. based competitor. This has
developed into a close relationship, both with the competitor for product and strategy
development and the customer in R&D regarding how Company A can enter the
communications ecosystem that is being delivered to the customer. Company A is
pursuing a strategy, thanks to the coopetitive effort, of developing their own
communications platform that would include all the necessary technology the
customer needs as a product that encompasses all the customers’ needs. This strategy
would eventually lead to discussion about changing the existing cooperative strategy
with the competitor or bypassing the competitor entirely in the long term. This
essentially means that Company A gained a foothold on an important market thanks
to their work with the competitor and could become an exclusive supplier with new
knowledge on customer demands.
Company B has seen benefits emerging from coopetition that gave them more
opportunities to reach potential customers such as NGOs and governments looking for
62

affordable and sustainable housing alternatives. They were able to set up trade shows
with their competitors that attracted new customers. Had Company B tried to
exclusively showcase their product, the attention from customers would not have been
the same. Having several options made the trade shows more attractive. While having
competitors present could be seen as a threat, Company B thought that the overall gain
was positive. They are also, by cooperating closely with their competitors, able to
improve their own product by having access to competitors products. Company B
approached coopetition with a mindset of goodwill, wanting to help similar firms and
realising that the market is large enough for all of them. However, they were also
careful of competing firms taking advantage of this goodwill by requiring those firms
that wanted to join to contribute financially, avoiding drag along firms.
RQ4: What are the managerial implications of coopetition in SME
internationalisation?
From this study it is clear that some form of coopetition can be beneficial for SMEs
in their internationalisation activities. The study has shown that SMEs can reduce the
resources needed to reach new markets by cooperating with competitors. The results
also show that the internationalisation efforts were helped by the coopetitive strategies
employed by both case companies. International opportunities were improved in terms
of reaching new customers and reducing costs for internationalisation and improving
product development. However, when pursuing coopetitive strategies, firms should
consider what competitors are suitable.
For SMEs, this study shows that the SMEs pursue coopetition with similarly sized and
aged companies, and that the relationships were formed on informal basis or through
intermediaries such as Business Finland. Being open about future plans and allowing
other firms to contact and join the effort can be beneficial for a firm. Firms should in
the future consider a “goodwill” approach to coopetition depending on the
circumstances, as practiced by Company B. Trust remains an important part of
coopetition, and companies should be careful about how potential coopetitive partners
can change the dynamic of the coopetitive relationship over time.

63

6.2 Limitations
The thesis analysed two companies based in Finland, and while the results show some
positive effects of coopetition for internationalisation activities, certain limitations still
exist. This case study analysed two case companies under a limited period. Thus, the
results of the study are limited to the specific scenarios of each individual firm, and a
larger sample size should confirm the results of this study. Further, the results are
limited to the specific industries of the firm. These limitations affect the generalisation
of the results.
The nature of the coopetition that the firms engaged in should also be taken into
account. Both firms used coopetitive relationships with other non–Finnish SMEs,
except for the case of Company A’s internationalisation in Indonesia. The results of
the study could be different if all the participating competitors were also Finnish
SMEs. This leads into possible future research on the subject.

6.3 Future research
An interesting avenue for further research would be to study how coopetition would
affect the internationalisation if all the participating actors were other Finnish SMEs.
While this thesis explored how Finnish SMEs initiate coopetitive relationships, there
is still ample room to explore how SMEs initiate coopetition, specifically Finnish
SMEs. Similarly, the motivations and results of coopetition for Finnish SMEs should
be validated by larger sample size to confirm the benefits and drawbacks of
coopetition for the internationalisation process. In addition, as this was a case study
that focused on the firms at a specific time, a case study over a longer time period
would be beneficial in furthering the understanding of coopetition, specifically on how
and why the relationships between firms changes over time.

Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning

Godhet eller opportunism? Användningen av koopetition i SMF
internationalisering.
Perspektiv från finska SMF

Inledning
Koopetition har fått ökad uppmärksamhet av forskare som försöker förstå dess
paradoxala natur (Bengtsson et al., 2016; Czakon, Mucha-Kus et al., 2014).
koopetition är en sammanslagning av konkurrens och samarbete som bildar ett nytt
slags strategiskt förhållande mellan två eller flera engagerande företag (Roig-Tierno
et al., 2018). I dagens komplexa och mycket konkurrensutsatta globala affärsmiljö
framstår koopetition som en potentiell strategi för att få en konkurrensfördel genom
att öka innovation, dela kostnader och risker, möjliggöra stordriftsfördelar och ge
tillgång till externa kunskaper och resurser (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Park et al.,
2014; Roig ‐ Tierno et al., 2018). Små och medelstora företag (SMF) lider ofta av brist
på resurser och kunskap, såväl som anseende och nätverksproblem, vilket leder till
svårigheter i internationaliseringen (Morais & Ferreira, 2020). Brist på tillräckliga
resurser kan göra det svårt för SMF att identifiera och rikta in sig på nya internationella
möjligheter och ingå nya satsningar, medan tillgång till samma resurser ses som en
utgångspunkt för internationalisering. Samarbetsstrategier kan hjälpa SMF att
övervinna några av hindren för internationalisering genom att ge tillgång till
kompletterande resurser (Vanyushyn et al., 2009).
Syfte och forskningsfrågor
Syftet med denna avhandling är att förstå rollen av koopetition i små och medelstora
finländska företags internationaliseringsprocess. För att utreda uppsatsens mål har
följande forskningsfrågor utvecklats.

65

FF1: Vilka är drivkrafterna för samarbete som avgör beslutet för små och medelstora
företag att internationalisera?
FF2: Hur inleds koopetition i finska små och medelstora företag?
FF3: Hur påverkar koopetition internationaliseringen av finska små och medelstora
företag?
FF4: Vilka är de främsta konsekvenserna av koopetition i internationalisering av små
och medelstora företag?
Teori
Koopetition är den samtidiga interaktionen av konkurrens och samarbete mellan
företag (Bengtsson et al., 2016) som genom målmedvetet arbete försöker öka
marknadens storlek och i sin tur öka det anslagna marknadsandelen för det enskilda
företaget (Gerschberger, 2019). Koopetition kombinerar de färdigheter och processer
som företag tillämpar för att få en konkurrensfördel genom ett samarbete som tillför
sådana resurser och sådan kunskap, till exempel genom forskning och utveckling, som
annars vore ouppnåeliga (Luo, 2007). Interaktionen samlar resurser och gör företagen
starkare

tillsammans,

medan

konkurrens

tvingar

företagen

att

öka

sin

innovationsförmåga. I ett alltmer konkurrensdrivet globalt landskap erbjuder
koopetition potential att dra nytta av både delade resurser och kunskap samt förbättrad
innovationsförmåga (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000).
Potentiella nackdelar till koopetition är opportunistiskt beteende (Cygler et al. 2018),
spänningar som skapas genom delning av kritisk information mellan företag, minskad
lönsamhet på grund av att man inte ändrar processer så att de lämpar sig för
koopetition på lämpligt sätt (Chiambaretto, 2016), hantering av värdeskapande (Ritala
& Tidström, 2014) samt isolering (Cygler et al., 2018).
Sedan Brandenburgers och Nalebuffs (1996) arbete om koopetition, har intresset att
studera koopetition ökat, men en klar definition har ännu inte definitivt fastslagits
(Soppe et al., 2014). Bengtsson et al. (2016) definierar koopetition som ett paradoxalt
förhållande, som antingen är horisontellt eller vertikalt, mellan två eller flera
konkurrenter som samarbetar. Denna avhandling följer denna definition.

66

I arbetet presenteras olika teoretiska synvinklar på hur man ser på koopetition, varav
ett är det resursbserade synsättet (RBV). RBV-teorin förklarar hur företag deltar i
samarbete för att förvärva kompletterande resurser från sina konkurrenter för att
upprätthålla en konkurrensfördel och förklarar därmed hur företag söker
samarbetsinriktade strategier för att tackla till exempel brist på resurser (Thomason et
al., 2013).
Ömsesidigt förtroende och nytta såväl som engagemang är viktiga faktorer i
koopetitiva relationer (Bengtsson et al., 2010) och som till och med bidrar till högre
företagsprestanda när det gäller små och medelstora företag (Morris et al., 2007).
Förtroende för ett samarbetsförhållande kan förändras både i intensitet och över tid,
vilket gör koopetitiva relationer mycket dynamiska (Thomason et al., 2013).
Att uppnå förtroende mellan företag är dock beroende på möjligheten att hitta
kompatibla företag. Det kan därför vara utmanande att hitta lämpliga företag att inleda
ett samarbetsförhållande med (Blanka & Traunmüller, 2020).
Drivkrafter för koopetition i SMF uppstår för att kompensera företagets nyetablering
på marknaden jämfört med etablerade företag. Det vill säga, SMF drivs att delta i
koopetition för att få fördelarna med samtidigt att samarbeta och konkurrera för att
lindra dessa problem, uppnå stordriftsfördelar och minska beroendet av redan få
resurser (Thomason et al., 2013). Dessutom möjliggör koopetition i SMF deltagande
i gemensam forskning och utveckling, vilket minskar de resurser som ofta behövs för
dessa, samt kombinerar företagens kunskap och färdigheter (Feela, 2020).
Metod
I avhandlingen avänds en kvalitativ fallstudie som behandlar två finska företag.
Fallstudiemetodiken används för att undersöka ett specifikt fenomen, i detta fall
koopetition och internationalisering inom finska SMF.
Datat samlades genom att intervjua finska SMF. Företagen kontaktades via LinkedIn.
Denna metod visade sig vara effektiv för att nå potentiella företag, och flera intervjuer

67

gjordes för att granska lämpligheten för avhandlingen. Två företag som samarbetar
med sina konkurrenter för att internationalisera sig har tagits med i denna avhandling.
Semi strukturerade intervjuer användes för datainsamling. Semi strukturerade
intervjuer möjliggör att undersökaren kan genomföra en intervju genom frågor om ett
visst tema, men där intervjuaren ändå fritt kan diskutera saker angående temat som
inte annars skulle ha tagits upp, vilket bidrar till att ytterligare information om ämnet
står till hands för avhandlingens analys (Hair et al. 2014). Den semi strukturerade
intervjun följde en intervjuguide, vars teman kan ses nedan (intervju guiden i sin helhet
kan ses i Bilaga 1).
1. Frågor gällande koopetition. Hur uppstod det, vad är dess egenskaper och vad
är dess effekter för företaget (frågor a – i)
2. Frågor gällande internationalisering. Hur påverkade de

koopetitiva

relationerna företagets internationalisering (frågor a – c).
3. Andra kommentarer gällande koopetition och internationalisering.
Pilotintervjuer genomfördes med ett finskt SMF och personer som arbetar med SMF
och internationalisering för att förbättra intervjufrågorna och försäkra att de var
lämpliga för intervjuerna som sedan hölls med fallföretagen. Intervjuerna
transkriberades för att sedan tematiseras genom kodning av transkriberingarna. En
tematisk analys användes för dataanalysen där huvudteman identifierades, så som
motivering för att använda koopetition, och sedan underkategorier som mera specifikt
förklarade orsaker och resultat från koopetition hos företagen.
För reliabilitet och validitet användes kriterierna trovärdighet och autenticitet
eftersom de lämpar sig bättre för kvalitativa studier. Till kriteriet trovärdighet hör
kredibilitet, överförbarhet. Kredibilitet försäkrades genom triangulering av de två
fallstudierna som tillåter jämförande av de två fallen och hjälper med att se vilka
fenomen och egenskaper från de två olika fallen kan generaliseras och vilka som inte
lämpar sig för det. Kredibiliteten stöds också genom att de intervjuade personerna
tillgång till resultaten för att bekräfta att resultaten är korrekta, samt genom att ge
läsaren tillräcklig information om undersökningsprocessen. Överförbarheten av
studien försäkrades genom att redovisa för undersökningsprocessen, fallstudiens
68

kontext samt diskussion av resultatet vilket ger läsaren en möjlighet att avgöra studiens
överförbarhet. Pålitligheten av studien kan bekräftas genom att försäkra sig att
undersökaren är opartisk I förhållande till de båda företagen som inkluderades i
studien. Företagen valdes ut slumpmässigt bland flera företag som var lämpliga
kandidater att undersökas.
Presentation av fallföretagen
Företag A är en tillverkare av trådlösa kommunikationsenheter som är beroende av
privata nätverk för att säkerställa anslutning i verksamhetskritiska operationer som i
sin tur inte kan använda offentliga nätverk som använder 3G- eller 4G-teknik.
Företaget A är baserat i Finland och har 70 anställda från och med 2019. År 2019
omsatte det 19 653 000 € med en vinst på 1 094 000 €.
Företag B är en innovatör inom bostadsindustrin och erbjuder en produkt som gör det
möjligt för kunder att snabbt och billigt bygga bostäder med färdigt fabricerade
byggblock. Materialet som används i byggblocken är en ekologisk biokomposit som
härrör från träfibrer som är biprodukter från skogsindustrin och återvunnen plast,
vilket gör produkten till en hållbar lösning jämfört med betong och andra traditionella
material.
Resultat och diskussion
Medan båda företagen deltar i koopetition för att öka sin internationella aktivitet
varierar deras strategier och metoder. Företag A bedriver koopetition i mera vertikala
relationer. Dessa relationer bildas med företag i båda ändorna av försörjningskedjan.
För att få närvaro på marknaden har de etablerat sig som en komponentleverantör med
en samarbetspartner som säljer liknande produkter för att få närvaro på marknaden, i
vad kan beskrivas som ett leverantörsförhållande till företaget (Soppe et al., 2014). I
ett annat fall har det samarbetat med en konkurrent för att dela kostnader och få
kunskap om marknaden, vilket i sin tur visade sig vara en framgångsrik strategi när
det gällde försäljning till kunder i Indonesien.

69

Företag B bedriver mera horisontella relationer för koopetition och samarbetar med
direkta konkurrenter för bättre täckning på marknaden och stordriftsfördelar vid
internationalisering. I dessa samarbetsrelationer betonas delning av kostnader och
ökad medvetenhet hos kunderna genom koopetition för att därmed nå en större publik.
Båda företagen har initierat koopetition på relativt informella grunder men har sett till
att införa processer som säkerställer bättre framgång för koopetition. Till exempel
använde sig Företag A av hjälp från ett universitet och Business Finland för att hitta
lämpliga partner. Företag B har sett till att varje företag i samarbetspartnerskapet
bidrar med en rättvis andel, vilket binder dem till relationen och undviker
opportunistiskt beteende.
I båda fallen bildade företagen samarbetsförhållanden med företag med liknande
egenskaper, vilket säkerställer en bra strategisk förutsättning för koopetition.
Baserat på litteraturgranskningen av koopetition finns det flera drivkrafter för små och
medelstora samarbeten när det gäller internationalisering.
Från resultaten av studien kan det hävdas att drivkrafterna för samarbete i små och
medelstora företag är relaterade till sänkning av kostnader, produktförbättring och
möjligheten att skapa kontakter på och få kunskap om internationella marknader.
Detta belyser en förändring i hur företag, inklusive de små och medelstora företagen i
denna studie, ser på sina konkurrenter. Båda fallföretagen har insett de potentiella och
verkliga fördelarna med att samarbeta med sina konkurrenter för att övervinna vissa
problem som kopplas till små och medelstora företag, för att nå en större kundbas och
förvärva nya kunder utomlands. Företag A skapade en strategi baserad på att arbeta
med konkurrenter för att erbjuda mer tillförlitlighet för kunderna och för att komma
in i ekosystem genom konkurrenter som levererar till stora tillverkare. Företag B antog
en strategi baserad på godhet som så småningom ledde till att de nådde högre framgång
på internationella marknader.
Studien visar att personliga kontakter mellan företag eller deras chefer kan leda till
bildandet av samarbetsrelationer. Dessutom använde sig Företag A av mellanhänder
70

för att hitta lämpliga konkurrerande företag i USA som ledde till bildandet av
koopetition. Företag A gick in i samarbetspartnerskapet som leverantör till en
amerikansk konkurrent, som insåg att samarbete skulle vara mer fördelaktigt än ett
rent konkurrerande förhållande. För Företag A inleddes samarbetsförhållanden på
informell basis med en konkurrent som hade en liknande utmaning att
internationalisera i Indonesien och Sydostasien, samt genom en mellanhand som
hjälpte dem att identifiera en konkurrent i USA.
Företag B kontaktade också konkurrenterna på informell basis och mätte och lockade
intresse från liknande företag som ville internationalisera genom öppen
kommunikation av sin strategi. Företag B närmade sig samarbete genom godhet, det
vill säga det insåg att marknaden är tillräckligt stor för att det kan hjälpa liknande
företag att nå samma kunder. Samarbetsförhållandet har bidragit positivt till företaget,
eftersom det både minskade sina kostnader och förbättrade sina produkter. Kontakter
med företag av samma storlek och ålder, med överensstämmande intressen, ledde till
bildandet av samarbetsvilliga relationer för både Företag A och Företag B.
När det gäller internationalisering upplevde båda företagen positiva resultat av
samarbetet med sina konkurrenter. Koopetition minskade kostnaderna, förbättrade
produkterna och gav dem tillgång till nya kunder. Som små och medelstora företag
såg båda företagen fördelar med att dela eller minska kostnader genom att dela dem
med konkurrenterna. Detta var beroende av faktumet att alla aktörer såg liknande
fördelar som motiverade dem att samarbeta.
Intervjuperson A nämnde att om de inte hade samarbetat med det andra finska
företaget, hade deras internationaliseringsarbete i Indonesien inte varit möjligt. Som
små och medelstora företag är resurserna knappa och att vara tvungen att
internationalisera sig ensam skulle ha varit en större utmaning. Fördelning av
kostnader och även en representant med lokala kunskaper om regelverk och även
lokala kontakter var en enorm fördel för Företag A. Medan den ursprungliga strategin
innebar delning av installationsplatser med det konkurrerande företaget, kunde
Företag A slutligen slå ut det konkurrerande företaget på vissa platser där kunden såg
att implementering av enbart Företag A:s teknik räckte.

71

På den amerikanska marknaden kunde Företag A etablera sig med stora
fordonstillverkare genom sitt samarbete med den USA baserade konkurrenten. Detta
har utvecklats till en nära relation både med konkurrenten och kunden. Med
konkurrenten på området för produkt- och strategiutveckling samt med kunden inom
forsknings- och utvecklingsarbete angående hur Företag A kan komma in i det
kommunikationsekosystem som levereras till kunden. Företaget A strävar efter en
strategi, tack vare koopetition, att utveckla sin egen kommunikationsplattform som
skulle inkludera all nödvändig teknik som kunden behöver, och erbjuda den som en
produkt som omfattar kundens alla behov. Denna strategi skulle så småningom leda
till diskussioner om att ändra den befintliga samarbetsstrategin med konkurrenten eller
att kringgå konkurrenten helt, på lång sikt. Detta innebär i huvudsak att Företag A fick
fotfäste på en viktig marknad tack vare sitt arbete med konkurrenten och kunde bli en
exklusiv leverantör med ny kunskap om kundernas krav.
Företag B har sett fördelar med samarbete som gav det fler möjligheter att nå
potentiella kunder som till exempel icke-statliga organisationer och regeringar som
letar efter förmånliga och hållbara bostadsalternativ. Det kunde delta i mässor med
sina konkurrenter som lockade nya kunder. Hade Företag B ensamt försökt visa upp
sin produkt hade kundernas uppmärksamhet inte varit densamma. Att ha flera
alternativ gjorde mässorna mer attraktiva. Samtidigt som det kunde ses som ett hot att
ha konkurrenter närvarande, tyckte Företag B att den totala nyttan var positiv. Genom
att samarbeta nära sina konkurrenter kan det också förbättra sin egen produkt genom
tillgång till konkurrenternas produkter. Företag B närmade sig samarbetet med en
tanke på godhet, och ville hjälpa liknande företag när de insåg att marknaden är
tillräckligt stor för alla. Det var dock också försiktigt och ville försäkra sig att
konkurrerande företag inte utnyttjade denna godhet genom att kräva att de företag som
ville gå med också skulle bidra ekonomiskt. Detta för att undvika att andra
konkurrenter inte utnyttjar företaget.
Av denna studie framgår det att någon form av koopetition kan vara till nytta för små
och medelstora företag i deras internationaliseringsaktiviteter. Studien har visat att
små och medelstora företag kan minska de resurser som behövs av företaget för att nå
nya marknader genom att samarbeta med konkurrenter. Resultaten visar också att
internationaliseringsarbetet fick hjälp av samarbetsstrategierna som användes av de
72

båda fallföretagen. De internationella möjligheterna förbättrades gällande att nå nya
kunder,

minska

kostnaderna

för

internationalisering

och

förbättra

produktutvecklingen.
För internationaliserande små och medelstora företag visar denna studie att finska små
och medelstora företag bedriver samarbete med företag i liknande storlek och ålder
och att relationerna bilda på informell basis eller genom mellanhänder som Business
Finland. Att vara öppen om framtida planer och låta andra företag kontakta och delta
i internationaliseringsprocessen kan vara till nytta för ett företag. Företagen bör i
framtiden

överväga

en

"godhets"

-metod

för

koopetition

beroende

på

omständigheterna, liknande den som används av Företag B. Förtroende är fortfarande
en viktig del av samarbete och företag bör vara försiktiga med hur potentiella
samarbetspartners kan förändra dynamiken i samarbetsvillkoren över tid.
Ett

intressant

tema

för

forskning

är

hur

samarbete

skulle

påverka

internationaliseringen om alla deltagande aktörer var uteslutande andra finska små och
medelstora företag. Medan denna avhandling undersökte hur finska små och
medelstora företag initierar samförhållandeförhållanden, finns det fortfarande gott om
utrymme att utforska hur finska små och medelstora företag initierar och genomför
samarbete. På samma sätt bör motivationen för och resultaten av samarbete för finska
små och medelstora företag valideras med större urvalsstorlek för att bekräfta
fördelarna och nackdelarna med samarbete inom en internationaliseringsprocess.
Dessutom, eftersom detta var en fallstudie som fokuserade på företagen vid en viss
tidpunkt, skulle en fallstudie över en längre tidsperiod vara till nytta för att främja
förståelsen för samarbete, speciellt för hur och varför förhållandena mellan företag
förändras över tid. Detta är särskilt intressant i en situation som den som Företag A
visar upp.
