Abstract
This thesis will investigate the possibility and feasibility of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a
technology to reduce CO2 emissions in the marine industry. Carbon capture post-combustion technologies
can be divided into absorption, adsorption, membrane, cryogenic, and all these technologies are investigated
in this thesis. Carbon capture can also be divided into post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxy-fuel
combustion and capture from industrial processes, this thesis will, however, only investigate postcombustion technologies. The transportation and storage of CO2 is also investigated.
The feasibility for carbon capture on marine vessels is investigated from a viewpoint of possible future
decarbonization of the marine industry. There are several challenges associated to carbon capture and
storage on marine vessels, for instance the space occupied onboard a vessel and the cost of a carbon capture
system.
An Excel tool is created by utilizing information gathered throughout the thesis and a chapter is dedicated to
the Excel tool and how it works. The objective of the tool is to provide carbon capture system size, power
demand and cost per captured ton of CO2.
The total cost of captured CO2 will fall in the region of 60-100 $/ton CO2 captured, the electrical energy
penalty in the region of 7-19 %, the emissions of CO2 from the vessel will increase by 3-38 % (reboiler
emissions only, see Chapter 7) and the fuel consumption will increase by 13-46 % with a capture percentage
of 90 %. The column heights of absorber and stripper columns are limited to 10-12 meters of height. The
space and weight of the carbon capture system will for a 15 MWel engine power installed vessel be around
11x11x4 meters of volume occupied and about 90-160 tons of weight. All results come from the Excel tool.

Denna avhandling kommer att utforska möjligheten och genomförbarheten för användningen av
koldioxiduppfångning och lagring för koldioxidutsläpps reduceringar inom marina industrin. Koldioxid
uppfångning efter förbränning är en teknik som kan delas in i absorption, adsorption, membran och kryogena
tekniker, alla dessa tekniker är utforskade i denna avhandling. Koldioxiduppfångning kan också delas in i efter
förbränning, före förbränning, oxybränsle-förbränning och uppfångning från industriella källor, denna
avhandling kommer dock bara fokusera på efter förbrännings koldioxiduppfångning. Transport och lagring
av koldioxid är också utforskat.
Genomförbarheten av koldioxiduppfångning på fartyg är utforskat med ett fokus på framtida
koldioxidutsläpps minskningar inom marina industrin. Det finns flera utmaningar med koldioxiduppfångning
och lagring på fartyg, till exempel, utrymmet och kostnaden för systemet.
Ett Excel verktyg skapas med informationen i avhandlingen och ett kapitel används för att förklara hur
verktyget fungerar. Syftet med verktyget är att uppskatta koldioxid uppfångningssystemets storlek,
kraftåtgång och kostnad för varje ton av koldioxid uppfångat.
Den totala kostnaden för uppfångat koldioxid är mellan 60–100 $/ton koldioxid, det elektriska energistraffet
är ungefär 7–19 %, utsläppen av koldioxid från fartyget kommer att öka mellan 3–38 % (endast värmepannan,
se kapitel 7) och bränslekonsumtionen kommer att öka mellan 13–46 %, med en uppfångningsprocent på 90
%. Kolumn höjderna är begränsade till 10–12 meters höjd, enligt utformning. Storleken och vikten på
koldioxid uppfångningssystemet kommer att vara för ett 15 MWel installationsstorlek att vara cirka 4x11x11
meter i volym och cirka 90-160 ton i vikt. Alla resultat kommer från Excel verktyget.

1. Introduction

Background
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology where CO2 is captured post-combustion, pre-combustion,
oxy-fuel combustion or from industrial processes and afterwards stored or reutilized. Post-combustion
processes capture CO2 from the exhaust gas from combustion engines, for instance in electricity generation
or in the transportation sector (marine shipping). In order to mitigate emissions of CO2, which is a greenhouse
gas (GHG) and a contributor to climate change, there is a need for long-term storage. Geological storage
would be an option. Large reservoirs need to be large enough for noticeable global CO2 emission
reductions. Potential reservoirs can be in saline formations, depleted oil and gas fields or formations
below the ocean floor. [1]
The carbon capture (CC) technology is one option in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. Other options
are the renewable energy transition, increased energy efficiency, switching to less carbon emitting fossil fuel
sources such as natural gas and the use of natural carbon sinks, for instance forestation, leading to a larger
global biomass sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere. [1]
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a vision of a 50 % GHG reduction until 2050 from the
2008 CO2 emission levels. The aim is to reduce emissions and start to phase them out from the industry,
driven primarily by international politics and policies. The IMO wants the shipping industry to be greener and
cleaner. This is done through regulatory work of air pollutants and by encouraging innovation and technology
research. The IMO has earlier been successful in the reduction of sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx)
through regulatory work. Regulating GHG emissions could yield a similar result. [2]
As the EU emissions trading system (ETS) is already a reality and alongside carbon taxes, CCS might be a good
way of reducing GHG emissions. The European Union´s ETS is the world´s first major carbon market. It has
led to an emissions reduction of 21 % in 2020 since 2005, in sectors covered by the ETS. Introducing a similar
trading system in the marine industry might have a similar outcome, not a reality today though. [3]

Objective
The objective of this thesis is to present all technologies that are considered mature or developing in postcombustion carbon capture for marine applications. The absorption CC technology is the most mature CC
technology now. Three solvents for CC with chemical absorption are chosen, namely MEA, Cansolv DC-103
and aqueous ammonia. An Excel tool is created for approximating the power demand and system size for a
1

potential CC system, utilizing mentioned solvents. This tool then provides the desired results that are
required. A case study of Aurora Botnia is utilized, see below in Chapter 1, to determine the power demand
and size of a CC system on that vessel.
Restrictions in information about process equipment will lead to high uncertainty regarding CC system size
and cost of equipment. The scope of the thesis is thus limited in order to decrease the work done in this
thesis. For future work, process equipment is required for accurate results, the results in Chapter 7 are now
rough estimations.
The process equipment is entered into the tool with information such as dimensions, power consumption
and cost, with this information the process equipment is designed in size, this approach is special to this
thesis compared to other works. Utilizing this approach to process equipment sizing, the Excel tool allows for
all sizes of engine installations to be entered, from 0.7 to 100 MWel. The scope is thereby, to create a tool for
approximating CC systems for marine vessels around the world for all possible installations that would be
interested in implementing the technology.
Further, carbon storage and transportation are considered for determining how to transport the captured
CO2 and what to do with the CO2 when arriving to harbors. An economic analysis is also provided for
determining cost of captured CO2 and similar results. The application of CC on marine vessels presents some
engineering challenges and these are also considered in this thesis.
In Chapter 2, the technologies are explained generally and the main CC technologies for absorption,
adsorption, membrane and cryogenic processes are investigated. The absorption CC technology will be
investigated more than adsorption, membrane and cryogenic CC technologies, as it is utilized in the Excel
tool. Adsorption, membrane and cryogenic CC technologies will be presented generally, with an overall
technology description.
In Chapter 3, the CO2 storage and transportation options are investigated. There are four main options for
storing CO2 long-term, which are geological storage, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and industrial uses.
Transportation is divided into shipping and pipeline transportation and in which form CO2 can be transported.
In Chapter 4, the economic analysis is investigated, with the cost of captured CO2 being the most important
value. Additionally, the transportation cost and storage cost of CO2 is investigated for determining the costs
that arrive after the discharge of CO2 in harbor. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) and financial incentives
are also considered for determining possible selling prices of CO2 and possible government support.
In Chapter 5, CC on marine vessels is investigated. Focus will be on equipment placement and the CC system
start-up and general system operation. These are however, investigated with a general overview, further
investigations will be needed but a general understanding can be provided.
2

In Chapter 6, the Excel tool documentation part is presented. The scope of this thesis is, as mentioned, to
create an Excel tool for determining CC system size and power demand. To understand all functions in the
Excel tool, a documentation part is thereby provided in this thesis. This tool contains a lot of information, the
scope is to provide important equations and referencing between tables but not to walkthrough everything,
as it will clutter the thesis with information. Assumptions are utilized for unknown information and is thereby
provided without a source; the developer can change these values whenever, allowing for easy change of
data and for increase in accuracy over time.
In Chapter 7, a case study of Aurora Botnia is presented. This study is provided for the presentation of results
such as, emissions, power demand, economic results and size of system and serves as an example of how to
enter vessel specific information and what kind of results can be obtained.
In Chapter 8, conclusions about the technologies and the Excel tool are discussed. Future recommendations
about technologies are given also for the future development of the Excel tool, as it is not completely
developed. Restrictions in information will be important to discuss, as the scope of this thesis is broad, and
uncertainties need to be addressed.

Aurora Botnia
A case study of AURORA BOTNIA will be presented in this thesis for showing what kind of results can be
obtained by the Excel tool created in this thesis. This new roll on, roll off passenger (RoPax) vessel, see Figure
1.1 and Table 1.1, will operate between Vaasa, Finland and Umeå, Sweden. This vessel will be among the
most environmentally friendly passenger vessels in the world. It is further the first new build ship for this
Vaasa-Umeå route, even though this route has been operated by vessels since the 1940s. The cost for the
vessel will be approximately 120 million euros and the expected delivery date is sometime in 2021. [4]

The engines installed are four W8V31DF engines from Wärtsilä with electric propulsion. The vessel will
operate on liquified natural gas (LNG) and biogas [5]. Additionally, the vessel is a hybrid vessel utilizing both
LNG/biogas and battery power. Batteries will be used for port entry and departure propulsion power, peak
shaving for a more constant engine load operation and hotel load power. [4]
The Aurora Botnia will be a “floating test laboratory” for close cooperation with Wärtsila’s Smart Technology
Hub in Vaasa. This will allow for real time monitoring and management of the vessel. [5]

2. Carbon capture technologies
There are four main technologies for carbon capture (CC): post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxy-fueling and
capture from industrial processes (by-product from cement or steel industry, for example). In this section,
only post-combustion carbon capture will be examined as it is most suitable for retrofitting
on existing marine vessels.
Generally, the CO2 concentration of marine engine exhaust gas is between 4-14 %-vol. In post-combustion
CC, high purity CO2 is separated from the exhaust gas, which enables it to be sold for enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) or to the beverage industry among others, see Chapter 3. Post-combustion technologies can be divided
into absorption, adsorption, membrane and cryogenic processes of carbon capture, Table 2.1 shows a
summary of mentioned technologies. These are both mature and developing technologies. [6]

processes will be investigated. The focus of the “Carbon capture technologies” Chapter will be the postcombustion absorption technologies. The post-combustion adsorption, membrane and cryogenic Chapters
are general descriptions of where the technologies are currently in their state of development.

Absorption
Absorption can be chemical or physical depending on which technology is utilized. Amine- based solvents are
utilized in chemical absorption methods. In chemical absorption, CO2 is separated from the exhaust gas by
chemically reacting with the exhaust gas. The CO2 absorbs to the solvent and desorbs from it later in the
regeneration stage (desorber or stripper column). Compared to physical absorption, chemical absorption has
a higher efficiency and often a lower cost, although the regeneration step, CO2 desorption, is more energy
intensive. The most mature technology today is chemical absorption using aqueous amine-based solvents
such as monoethanolamine (MEA). [7]
Physical absorption solvents are for instance selexol, rectisol or glycol, not considering these though.
Chemical absorption solvents can be divided into amine-based, amino acids, ammonia, ionic liquids (IL) and
aqueous piperazine (PZ) solvents. [8] Amine-based solvents contain primary, secondary or tertiary amine
structures and at least one hydroxide group (OH). For instance, monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine
(DEA) and methyl diethanolamine (MDEA). [9]

MEA
MEA is the most utilized chemical solvent, typically used as a 30%/70%-wt solution in water, because of its
fast reaction rate with CO2. Faster reaction rates allow for smaller vertical column reactors and in addition
MEA is quite cheap. A typical absorption process can be seen in Figure 2.1. The main components are
absorber and stripper columns. [7]
Absorber column: The chemical solvent (returning from the stripper column) enters the absorber column
from the top. The exhaust gas (flue gas) enters from the bottom. The reaction is usually of counter-current
type in a vertical packed column reactor. The enriched CO2 solvent exits from the bottom of the reactor as
rich solvent and is pumped to the stripper column. Treated exhaust gas (lean in CO2) exits in the top of the
column. [7]
Stripper column: The rich solvent is pumped from the bottom of the absorber column to the top of the
stripper column. Added heat is required, a heat exchanger provides excess heat from the lean solvent exiting
the stripper column (poor solvent) to the rich solvent that is entering the stripper column. The regeneration
of the solvent happens when the temperature increases, and CO2 desorbs from the solvent. Lean solvent
exits via the bottom of the stripper column, depleted of CO2. The CO2 exits through the top of the stripper
column, to be purified from water (in the condenser) and other contaminants and is later stored and
transported away. [7] The stripping thermal duty is about 3.6 GJ/ton CO2. [10]

6

Figure 2.1: Chemical absorption process description. [7]

Heat exchanger: A heat exchanger is installed to exchange the higher temperature of the lean solvent to the
rich solvent. Further, heat exchangers are installed for cooling demands where sea water can be utilized for
cooling purposes, thus reducing the electric power demand. [7]
Coolers: Extra coolers are required for cooling the lean solvent to operation temperature in the absorber
column and further for cooling the exhaust gas before entering the absorber column. [7] An intercooler can
be installed for increasing the absorption capacity of the solvent. The absorption process is exothermic and
therefore removing heat from the bottom part of the column increases the absorption capacity of the
solvent. [11]
Condenser: A condenser removes the water from the CO2 product, exiting the stripper column. The water
removed is pumped back to the stripper column. A condenser can be further installed for removing water
from the exhaust gas, but the water balance can be neutral in the absorption column by leaving the water in
the exhaust gas and by reducing the temperature of the exhaust gas in the top part of the column, and
thereby preventing water from escaping the absorption column. [12]
Reboiler: Reboilers supply heat to the stripper column by providing steam at approximately 120-140 °C and
2-3 bar of pressure. The reboilers utilize burners for generating the steam in the reboiler. The water
condensed in the stripper column exits in the bottom part of the stripper column and is vaporized by the
reboiler for another regeneration cycle. A lean vapor compressor (LVC) can be installed to reduce the reboiler

7

size, by compressing the condensed steam to higher temperature and it is then re-introduced into the
stripper column. [10]
Solvent degradation: The degradation rate of MEA is approximately 2.2 kg of MEA/ton CO2 captured. This
degradation is due to thermal degradation, carbamate polymerization and oxidative degradation (primarily
by O2, NO, NO2). Thermal degradation typically occurs at above 200 °C, does not impact absorber and stripper
column temperatures in these processes, in this case under 140 °C. Oxidative degradation occurs due to
dissolved oxygen (DO) in the solvent. Methods to reduce DO in the solvent is the addition of additives such
as Inhibitor A, sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) or formaldehyde. [9] Carbamate polymerization occurs in the
stripper column where the MEA carbamate (rich solvent) formed in the absorber column normally reverses
its reaction by releasing CO2, forming MEA and CO2. If this reaction does not occur, MEA carbamate can
cyclize to form 2-oxazolidone and many other products. [13]
Another source states 0.1-14.9 kg of MEA degradation/ton CO2. Contaminants such as “SOx, NOx,
halogenated compounds, hydrocarbons and other impurities” [14] react with MEA and form “oxazolidine-2one, MEA urea, HEIA and HEEDA” [14]. Thermal degradation mainly occurs in the stripper column in presence
of high temperature, around 120 °C, compare this to the source [9] value of above 200 °C. Oxidative
degradation typically occurs in the absorber column because of the high oxygen content in the exhaust gas.
[14]
The general temperatures and pressures of the MEA process are available in Table 2.2. A more detailed
process overview can be seen in Appendix A.1.

Cansolv DC-103
Shell Cansolv is another potential amine-based solvent for large-scale CC. The Cansolv solvent studied in [11]
is a DC-103 solvent mixture, a binary mixture of 50 wt-% DC-103 and 50 wt-% water. Compared to MEA, this
8

solvent requires less thermal energy for regeneration and less solvent degradation is observed. The average
energy requirement (heat) is 2.33 GJ/ ton CO2. [11]
The Cansolv process plant, see Figure 2.2, contains absorber and stripper as in Figure 2.1, the process
temperatures and pressures of the Cansolv process are similar to the MEA process, see Table 2.3. Some
additional features are added, namely thermal reclaimer unit (TRU), intercooler, water wash section, a
mechanical vapor recompression unit (MVR) and a lean amine flash tank/vessel. [11] These features, the
TRU, intercoolers, water wash sections and LVC are utilized in the MEA process similarly. [10] [14]
Thermal reclaimer unit (TRU): The TRU is a vacuum distillation process where ionic and non-ionic degradation
products are removed through reduced pressure and heating. Water and DC-103 amine boil off and degraded
amine and contaminants are collected in the bottom, in a semi-batch mode. [11] These contaminants are
formed during amine degradation processes and from contaminants such as SO2. [15]

Figure 2.2: Cansolv DC-103 process description. [11]

Intercooler: The intercooler operates to reduce temperature in the column. The absorption process is an
exothermic reaction and reducing the temperature leads to a higher absorption capacity of the solvent. [11]

9

Water wash: The water wash section, in the top of the absorption column, captures volatile compounds and
amine absorbed in the exhaust gas. Afterwards, exhaust gas is released to the atmosphere as treated exhaust
gas. [11]
LVC (MEA) or MVR: Furthermore, the MVR along with the reboiler provides energy to the regeneration
process in the stripper column. Exiting lean solvent from the stripper column is reduced in pressure in the
lean amine flash tank, water vapor is thus sent to the MVR for recompression and is reintroduced to the
stripper column. Steam condensates are collected from the reboiler in the steam condensate level pot. Later,
it is reduced in pressure utilizing a pressure reducing valve. In the steam condensate flash pot, it is reduced
to the pressure of water vapor leaving the lean amine flash tank and some of it is reintroduced to the stripper.
Incorporation of the MVR results in a reduction of steam consumption by 33 %. The MVR and utilization of
the condensate from the reboiler results in a 38 % reduction in steam consumption, resulting in less thermal
energy requirements. [11] Without the MVR installed the stripping duty increases from 2.33 GJ/ton CO2 to
approximately 3.1 GJ/ton CO2 [16].

Ammonia
An aqueous ammonia process was developed by [17], where the issue of ammonia precipitation, solids
formation and the energy penalty of conventional processes was solved. The benefits of this aqueous
ammonia process are minimized solids formation and precipitation of ammonia and thus, clogging of the
process equipment and slipped ammonia content are minimized. The clogging of process equipment
inevitably leads to temporary shutdown of the CC process. Instead of stripper columns, this process utilizes
thermal decomposition reactors. Precipitation of ammonia and the solids formation can be avoided by
increasing temperature and by increasing the liquid/gas ratio, but it leads to a higher power consumption of
the process and is therefore not considered acceptable. Instead, the thermal decomposition reactor and a

10

solids handling section are introduced, see Figure 2.3. The solids handling section contain a saturation
reactor, crystallizer and a filter section. [17]
Absorbers: Furthermore, this process contains two absorber column sections where the first column
(absorber-1) is operated at above 20 °C and the second absorber column (absorber-2) at above 10 °C, see
Table 2.4. Clogging in the absorber column is minimized as the CO2 loading is low enough in absorber-1, and
thus the risk of solids formation is low. In absorber-2 a bubble column is utilized or a packed bed column with
special packing designed for precipitating systems, once again, risk of clogging is minimized. The drawback
of having two absorbers is space occupied by the equipment and cost, but the alternative is increased
clogging risk and higher power consumption. [17]
Solids handling section: The rich solvent exiting absorber-2 is joined by a CO2 recycle flow that increases the
CO2 content that enters the saturation reactor. In the crystallizer, the objective is to form solid ammonia
through saturating the rich solvent with more CO2 and by cooling the process to around 10 °C, where solids
form. In the filter section the solids formation, about 70 wt-%, proceeds to the thermal reactor and liquid
rich solvent, about 30 wt-%, is pumped to Wash-1 for absorbing the slipped ammonia from the treated
exhaust gas. Afterwards, this rich solvent is pumped to wash-1 for absorbing slipped ammonia from the CO2
product. [17]
Thermal decomposition reactor: This developed process was demonstrated by simulation in Aspen Plus. The
result was a regeneration power requirement of 2.85 GJ/ton CO2, which is comparable to conventional amine
processes. The thermal stripping temperature in this process is reduced from around 120 °C for amine
processes to 86 °C in this aqueous ammonia process. This allows for lower temperature heat sources to be
utilized for heating duties of the thermal decomposition reactor. [17]
Washing columns: There are also two washing sections for exhaust gas and CO2 product respectively. The
washing stages reduces the ammonia slip content to 100-200 ppm in the treated exhaust gas (after wash-2)
and the CO2 product purity to 99-99.5 wt-% (after wash-2), with impurities being slipped ammonia and water.
The washing columns for reducing the ammonia slip are operated at different temperatures and pressures,
see Table 2.4. The CO2 product is washed at above 5 bar and preferably above 90 °C, as ammonia dissolves
easier than CO2 in highly loaded solutions (rich solvent entering the wash-1) and the selectivity towards
ammonia increases with increased temperature and pressure. [17]
CO2 recycle: A CO2 recycle is utilized for increasing the CO2 content entering the saturation reactor. By
increasing the CO2 content in the rich solvent, more ammonium bicarbonate is produced. The role of the
saturation reactor is to concentrate the rich solvent before it enters the crystallizer, leading to a larger
amount of ammonium bicarbonate being produced in the crystallizer. [17]

11

Wash-1 CO2 product compression: The CO2 product exiting the separation reactor after the thermal
decomposition reactor is compressed as the washing of CO2, as mentioned before, require high pressure and
temperature. To compress the CO2 product with high ammonia content and a higher mass flow than
compression with only CO2 product, the compression power will be much larger for the ammonia process,
compared to the MEA and Cansolv processes, see Chapter 7. [17]

Ionic liquids
Ionic liquids (IL) can be an effective alternative for MEA-based solvents. This solvent has advantages such as
low volatility, good dissolution properties and high resistance to thermal degradation. ILs offer routes to
promising new technologies for CC, as significant energy savings and cost reductions can be observed. In [18]
the IL solvent, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium Bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) or shortly (bmim [Tf2N]), showed
a total thermal energy and electrical power consumption reduction of 30 % compared to typical MEA
processes. [18]
Additional advantages with ILs are recyclability and designability. ILs can be specifically designed for optimum
CO2 absorption. Other advantages are wide liquidus range and relative non-flammability. The main drawback
for ILs is high viscosity. The absorption of CO2 further increases viscosity for ILs, can be 200 times that of
water. Viscosity can be lowered by utilizing functionalized ethers or imidazolate anions. For example, addition
of functionalized ethers can reduce viscosity by 43 %. Additionally, ILs are expensive and research is required
in environmental impact, corrosivity, toxicity and long-term stability. [19]
The process for capturing CO2 using ILs, see Figure 2.4, contains one absorber column and instead of a stripper
column, two flash sections are utilized for regenerating the IL solvent. In the absorber column, cleaned
exhaust gas is released in the top of the column, mostly N2. Enriched solvent exits via the bottom and is
pumped to flash-1. The gas (mixture of N2, CO2 and some water vapor) is separated from the liquid enriched
solvent in flash-1, gas is then recirculated back to the absorber column for further absorption. In flash-2, CO2
is released at the top and liquid solvent is recirculated back to the absorber column for another absorption
cycle. [18]
Two multistage compressors are utilized for increasing the pressure of the exhaust gas until it reaches the
absorption column. After the first compression stage, water is separated from the exhaust gas in a gas-liquid
separator and mixed with separated recirculated gas from flash-1. Gas (mostly CO2 and N2) from flash-1 is
compressed and cooled and is returned to the compression stage before entering the absorber again. Other
cooling stages include the regenerated solvent cooling, which is pumped to the top section of the absorber
column for another absorption cycle. [18]

13

Figure 2.4: Ionic liquid process description. [18]

Piperazine
Another promising amine is piperazine (PZ), which is a polycyclic amine. PZ is often utilized as a reaction rate
promoter, either alone or in mixture with other solvents. Compared to MEA, PZ has these advantages such
as double the absorption rate, nearly double the CO2 capacity, thermal stability up to 150 °C and much lower
oxidative degradation. As PZ does not have an alcohol group, it is much more stable at high temperatures
and pressures than MEA. Solvent degradation needs to be controlled to reduce costs. The cost of MEA is
about 2 $/kg solvent compared to 6 $/kg for PZ solvent. [20]
In [20], three pilot plant projects were reviewed to test operating conditions. An aqueous PZ concentration
of 37.6 wt-% was utilized, the remaining solution being water. The pilot plants were designed for both
exhaust gas from hard coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. The exhaust gas pre-treatment, see
Figure 2.5, contain dust filter, blower, cooler, separation column and pre-scrubber. Before entering the dust
filter, the exhaust gas is desulfurized. The dust filter removes fine particles present in the exhaust gas. A
blower is utilized to increase pressure and to increase the flow rate of exhaust gas. The process operates
similarly to the MEA process previously mentioned. The main components are absorber and stripper
columns, see Figure 2.5. A heat exchanger is utilized between rich and lean solvents. The regeneration power
required for the PZ process is about 3.17 GJ/ton CO2. The solvent flow rate was about 20 % lower than the
conventional MEA process case. This leads to less pumping and cooling demands of the lean solvent. [20]

Adsorption
Adsorption carbon capture can be divided into chemical and physical adsorption. Important characteristics
of adsorbents are high adsorption capacity, thermal and mechanical stability, good adsorption and
desorption properties and high selectivity properties. [8] In adsorption, molecules of the exhaust gas attach
spontaneously to the solid surface of the adsorbent. Absorption is not the same as adsorption, absorbents
attach molecules to its entire material or liquid form and adsorbents attach molecules to their surface. [21]

Chemical adsorption
Chemical adsorbents are for instance metal oxides, alkali metal compounds and hydrotalcites. Metal oxides
are for instance, calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO). In the reaction one mole of metal oxide
can react with one mole of CO2 in a reversible reaction. [8] The CaO-based sorbent cycle is divided into
calcination and carbonation. [22] The alkali metal compounds are for instance, lithium silicates and lithium
zirconates. Hydrotalcites are materials with layered structures of positively charged cations and negatively
charged anions. [8]
Especially, calcium oxide is interesting as a chemical adsorbent for capturing CO2. The availability of calcium
oxide is high, and the cost is low for raw material (limestone). Calcium oxide is converted into calcium
15

carbonate in a carbonation reactor at approximately 923 K and the reverse reaction, calcination occur at
approximately 1123 K. [8]
The main disadvantages of chemical adsorbents are regeneration energy required and cost related.
Nanomaterials could be utilized for improving efficiency and lowering the regeneration energy required but
it comes at the cost of material, as nanomaterials are expensive. [8]

Physical adsorption
Physical adsorption processes require less energy compared to chemical adsorption processes as no chemical
bonds are created between sorbate and sorbent. The main disadvantage is worse CO2/N2 selectivity
compared to chemical adsorbents. Solving the selectivity issue for physical adsorbents would present an
alternative for amine-based absorption processes in the sense that power consumption is reduced. [23]
The main adsorbents in physical adsorption are zeolites, metal organic frameworks (MOF) and carbonaceous
materials. The main drawback with adsorbents is low CO2 selectivity. Carbonaceous and MOF materials
exhibit higher CO2 adsorption capacities, these materials require high pressure and low temperature
operation. Zeolites show lower CO2 adsorption capacity and require much less pressure for adsorption but is
operated at high temperatures. [9] The presence of contaminants such as SOx, NOx and H2O greatly impacts
the adsorption. Pretreatment stages are utilized for removing these impurities. [8]

Regeneration cycles
There are five different cycles for regenerating the adsorbent, which are pressure swing adsorption (PSA),
temperature swing adsorption (TSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), electric swing adsorption (ESA) and
vacuum/pressure and temperature swing adsorption (VTSA/PTSA). [8] In adsorption, the exhaust gas enters
the packed bed reactor and is adsorbed to the sorbent material. When the sorbent is saturated with CO2, the
adsorbent material is regenerated through temperature, pressure, vacuum or electric swing driving forces.
In TSA, exhaust gas is cooled when it enters, and the sorbent is heated when it is regenerated. Heat is
removed during adsorption, and heat is added for desorption of CO2. [24]
TSA: TSA is utilized in air separation units, where trace amounts of CO2 and water are separated from air, and
in natural gas dehydration. Some adsorbents such as 13x Zeolite adsorbs a lot of water. This reduces the CO2
capacity and thus, a need for drying of the exhaust gas is required. The extra drying adds a 2-3 GJ/ ton CO2
thermal energy penalty to the process. Therefore, new adsorbents are required to lower this energy
requirement. Packed beds have been utilized extensively with the disadvantage of long cycle times. [24]
Fluidized beds are proposed to enhance heat transfer. The cycles in TSA are adsorption, evacuation,
16

regeneration and cooling, see Figure 2.6. A CO2 reduction of 90 % is achieved. Utilizing fluidized beds, the
energy requirement is reduced to 2.1 GJ/ ton CO2 as a theoretical low, while a realistic value would be around
3.2 GJ/ ton CO2 thermal. [25]

Figure 2.6: Process flow diagram of a TSA carbon capture plant. [26]

The process flow diagram in Figure 2.6 shows a 1 kW pilot plant system designed in [26]. The adsorption unit
is of fluidized bed type. Rotary kilns are utilized for regenerating the adsorbent. The rotary kilns are utilized
for both heating and cooling the adsorbent. Heating water is provided by the engine exhaust gas while cooling
is provided by a cooling tower. Before entering the adsorber, a flue gas desulphurization (FGD) system
removes contaminants (SOx, NOx). The solid adsorbent enters in the bottom of the adsorption column, with
exhaust gas carrying it upwards. CO2 is adsorbed onto the adsorbent (rich adsorbent) after which it is
separated from the treated exhaust gas in a cyclone on top of the column, see Figure 2.6. The exhaust gas
exits to the stack and the rich adsorbent is transported to the regeneration section. In the regeneration stage,
the rotary kilns heat the adsorbent and CO2 is released. CO2 is then transported for compression and possibly,
liquefaction. The lean adsorbent is afterwards, transported through rotating cooling kilns, cold adsorbent can
now be reintroduced to the adsorption column and a new cycle begins. [26]

17

VSA and PSA: Cyclic adsorption utilizing vacuum or pressure are relatively mature technologies. As the
exhaust gas is mostly N2, VSA regeneration might be more logical than PSA. The vacuum levels required are
in the 10 kPa range or one tenth of atmospheric pressure. This would result in a CO2 purity of around 95 %
with the adsorbent 13x Zeolite. The energy requirement for the reboiler duty has been reported to be about
1.5-3 GJ/ton CO2 electrical (4.5-9 GJ/ ton CO2 thermal), compared to conventional amine processes at 2-4 GJ/
ton CO2 thermal, it is much more energy intensive. [25]
ESA: ESA utilizes the same adsorption method as TSA, heat is the driving force for separation. The only
difference is how the column is heated. ESA utilizes the Joule effect and TSA utilizes heating from warm gases.
The ESA cycle can be divided into two phases. Firstly, exhaust gas is introduced to the column until CO2 is
detected at the end of the column. Afterwards, exhaust gas is switched to an inert gas stream (air) and an
electric current is introduced, heating the column. When the temperature in the column reaches 150 °C, the
current is shut off, but inert gas continues to flow until no CO2 is detected in exiting gas anymore. The cycle
is repeated with exhaust gas reintroduced. [27]
VTSA/PTSA: The application of both vacuum and temperature swing adsorption for regenerating the
adsorbent have shown to increase capture percentage and increase the purity of the product CO2. Similarly,
for pressure and temperature swing adsorption, the same conclusion can be seen, combining the
regeneration processes tend to increase the capture percentage and CO2 purity. [23]

Membrane
Carbon capture utilizing membranes is a relatively new research area within CC. The CO2 captured in
membrane technology is of low purity, and thus, not suitable for applications where high CO2 purity is
required. CO2 from exhaust gas contains a relatively low concentration of CO2 and thus, very high selectivity
membranes are required. This is the main limitation in membrane CC, research today is primarily focused on
developing new materials with higher selectivity and permeability. [28]
Membrane separation technology is a physical separation method. The exhaust gas enters on one side of the
semipermeable barrier, see Figure 2.7. There are two sides, the retentate and permeate side. The CO 2
molecules on the retentate side permeate over to the permeate side along with some N2, O2 and H2O
molecules. The retentate stream will be CO2-lean and the permeate stream will be CO2-rich. [29]
Alongside low CO2 concentration, the low pressure and the great flows of exhaust gas are additional problems
in designing membrane systems. To separate CO2 from primarily N2 is a relatively easy process for membranes
with high permeance and high CO2/N2 selectivity. The challenge is power consumption for compression or
vacuum equipment. The great volumetric flows lead to large and expensive membranes. [30]
18

Figure 2.7: Membrane separation technology for post-combustion carbon capture. [29]

Membrane design
The pressure ratio is a key design consideration for membrane separation. Compression on the retentate
side creates a flow from retentate side to the permeate side. Another way of creating the driving force for
separation is having a vacuum on permeate side. In other words, the partial pressure of CO2 must be greater
on the retentate side in order to create a flow of CO2 molecules to the permeate side, which has a lower
partial pressure. A pressure ratio of five to ten is considered economically feasible, as higher pressure-ratios
lead to compression and vacuum equipment that require too much electrical power. With a pressure ratio
of five, where retentate pressure is 5 bar and permeate pressure is 1 bar, the maximum CO 2 concentration
(permeate side) that is achievable is 50 % even with very high selectivity membranes. [30]
Advantages of compression against vacuum equipment are less membrane area needed and that the capital
expenditure of compression equipment are about two-thirds that of vacuum equipment. Compression
equipment utilizes less than a quarter of the membrane area needed for vacuum equipment. Drawbacks of
utilizing compression equipment is mainly large power consumption, up to 20 % of a typical CO2 producing
power plant’s power is utilized for 5 bar compression. This can be explained by the large amounts of exhaust
gas, mostly N2. Instead, permeate vacuum gas contains larger amounts of CO2 in lesser volumes, meaning
less volume that requires vacuum conditioning. [30]
Another design consideration is crossflow or counterflow membrane modules, see Figure 2.8. Crossflow
modules with a pressure ratio of five achieves a CO2 concentration of 29 %. Comparing crossflow with
counterflow shows that counter-flow performs better with an increase in CO2 concentration from 29 % to 41
% in permeate side CO2 concentration and a membrane area reduction of 38 % and power consumption
reduction of 18 %. [30]

19

Figure 2.8: Crossflow and counterflow membrane separation modules. [30]

Figure 2.9: Introduction of sweep module and wet feed to counterflow module. [30]

20

Membrane area can further be reduced with the use of sweep modules, see Figure 2.9. Here, part of the
retentate gas (6 %) is redirected and reduced in pressure to the permeate side. Membrane area can be
reduced by almost 40 % by adding a sweep module. At the end of the retentate module, the exhaust gas
contains about 2-3 % of CO2, which leads to a 10-15 % CO2 concentration on the permeate side. If retentate
gas containing 2-3 % CO2 is added to the permeate side with 10-15 % of CO2, the concentration of CO2 then
decreases in permeate side, which leads to a larger difference in partial pressure between retentate and
permeate sides and more CO2 permeate over to the permeate side. This leads to an increased rate of
permeation of CO2 and thus, less membrane area will be required, see Figure 2.9 (b). As there probably will
be water vapor in the exhaust gas, a wet feed might be added to the example, see Figure 2.9 (c). As water
vapor is more permeable than CO2, it will increase CO2 permeation due to the more dilute permeate gas and
further reduce membrane area required with another 10 % in reduction. [30]
Another way of increasing the CO2 capture percentage is by introducing a two-step counterflow/sweep
module. Figure 2.10 shows the two-step module. Vacuum pumps are utilized for creating the pressure ratio.
The exhaust gas leaving the first step I, contains about 7 % of CO2 which is a reduction from 11.6 % or a 40 %
reduction in a crossflow module. The second step is a counterflow/sweep module, reducing the exhaust gas
CO2 concentration to 1.8 % from 7 %. A 90 % CO2 removal is achieved. [30]

22

A 20 tons of CO2/day carbon capture module, see Figure 2.11, with a two-step membrane separation process,
see Figure 2.10, was demonstrated at a supercritical pulverized coal power plant. The membrane capture
system is compact compared to the advanced solvent absorption process, see Figure 2.11 comparison. The
main advantages of membrane separation processes are the avoidance of absorption and stripper columns.
The membrane modules are arranged in skids, see Figure 2.12. The membrane modules are placed on top of
the module and equipment are placed beneath. [31]

Membrane materials
Membrane materials can be divided into polymer membranes, microporous organic polymer membranes
(MOP), Fixed site carrier membranes (FSC), mixed matrix membranes (MMM), carbon molecular sieve
membranes (CMSM) and inorganic membranes. Important properties of membranes are thermal stability,
separation performance, chemical stability and low cost. Membranes are required to withstand
contaminants such as SOx and NOx and exposure to high temperatures and pressures (up to approximately
400 °C and 10 bar). Inorganic membranes can withstand these conditions but are expensive. [32]
Membranes such as “MTR Polaris” have been demonstrated on pilot-scale, with good performance in the
presence of contaminants. This performance of MTR Polaris has been demonstrated at a 1 MW coal-fired
power plant, with promising results, see [31]. Pilot scale membrane systems by NTNU with stable
performance and a “PolyActive” membrane module by Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht have also been
developed. These new membranes have demonstrated that membranes for post-combustion carbon capture
might become competitive with conventional amine post-combustion technologies, with further progress
and cost reductions. Demonstration projects are further needed to prove feasibility for exhaust gas carbon
capture applications. [32]

Cryogenic
A cryogenic carbon capture (CCC) process with an external cooling loop (ECL) was reviewed in [33] for a 550
MWel coal-fired power plant. The potential with this technology is the capture of 99+ % of CO 2 purity and
capture of contaminants such as SO2, NO2, particulate matter (PM) and other exhaust gas trace contaminants.
The energy penalty of CCC with ECL is 0.74 MJel/kg CO2. This is about 15 % of the net power output of the
power plant, power loss is 82.6 MWel down from 550 MWel without CCC to 467 MWel with CCC. [33]
CCC cools the exhaust gas to 154 K or about -120 °C in a staged desublimation column (see Figure 2.13).
Formation of solid CO2 particles occurs in the desublimation process and are transported to a solid separation
column. A mixed refrigerant cooling loop is utilized for the desublimation process with direct contact with
23

CO2. Mixed refrigerant is separated from solid CO2 in the solid separation column. The mixed refrigerant is
cooled by a CF4 refrigeration cycle, along with an ECL of natural gas, in other words LNG. A melting heat
exchanger melts solid CO2 and mixed refrigerant (amount not separated in solid separation column) after the
solid separation column. Mixed refrigerant is regenerated from the contact liquid recovery stage and is
recycled back to the staged column. Cleaned exhaust gas is heated by incoming exhaust gas in a multi-stream
heat exchanger. [33]
The CCC process is reported [34] to consume about 30 % less energy (thermal+ electrical) than conventional
absorption CC processes. Additionally, the capture rate can be increased by decreasing the desublimation
column temperature for instance, at -120 °C a 90 % capture rate is achieved and at -135 °C a 99 % capture
rate is achieved. It is thus, possible to increase the CCC temperature to decrease the capture rate, consuming
less electric power. [34]
Advantages to CCC are water savings, pollutant control, reduced total power requirement and reduced cost
of captured CO2. The reduced water consumption arrives from reduced cooling water consumption,
compared to absorption CC processes. Pollutant control is possible due to the desublimation of CO2,
separating the contaminants from CO2. This leads to a high purity CO2 product, +99 wt-%. [34]
The reduced power requirement for CCC arrives from no thermal energy requirement as in the absorption
CC process, almost only electric power is required for the refrigeration equipment. LNG can be utilized as an
ECL, as mentioned before, reducing the refrigeration power demand further. The electric power demand is
however higher in the CCC process because of high refrigeration cooling demands. [34]

3. Carbon storage and transportation
Carbon storage can be divided into long-term and temporary storage. The long-term storage option refers to
carbon storage and temporary storage in this work refers to carbon transportation. The purpose of storing
CO2 long-term is to reduce the CO2 levels of the atmosphere. The carbon storage option can be divided into
geological storage, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and industrial uses. [35] Temporary storage aims to
store the CO2 from the capture point to the final storage point. Temporary storage can be in supercritical,
gaseous, liquid and in solid phase, depending on the pressure and temperature of CO2. [36]

Carbon storage
This section will investigate geological storage, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and industrial uses of CO2.
As mentioned above, carbon storage refers to the long-term storage option with the aim of reducing the
impact of CO2 in the atmosphere. [35]

Geological storage
The geological storage option is the only commercially utilized method for storing CO2 long-term today. This
method consists of two main approaches, either CO2 is injected into non-potable saline aquifers or in oil and
gas reservoirs (either empty or as part of enhanced oil or gas recovery, EOR or EGR). Especially the injection
into oil and gas reservoirs option is commercially viable due to its wide application in the oil and gas industry
today. Additionally, the site characterization for injection and monitoring technologies are well developed.
CO2 injection into operating oil and gas fields are also proven to enhance hydrocarbon extraction and thus
presents economic incentives for injecting CO2 into reservoirs. The risk of CO2 leakage is minimal as the oil
and gas reservoirs have a proven sealing cap rock that has withstood oil and gas leakage throughout time.
However, the presence of CO2 and its impact chemically needs to be addressed as these sealing cap rocks
have been in contact with oil and natural gas primarily through time. Saline aquifer´s sealing cap rocks need
to demonstrate the same ability of trapping the CO2 as depleted and operating oil and gas reservoirs do. [35]
The capacity for CO2 storage in depleted and operating oil and gas reservoirs is approximately 1000-1200 Gt
CO2 and for saline aquifers up to 20 000 Gt CO2. A storage amount of 1500 Gt CO2 will be required until year
2100, to stabilize the CO2 atmospheric levels at 450 ppm. [35] Figure 3.1 shows different geological storage
options available. CO2 geological storage sites can be either onshore or offshore but onshore storages suffers
from low public acceptance. Apart from depleted or operational oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams can also
be utilized for geological storage. CO2 can be injected into coal seams for enhanced coal bed methane (CBM)
recovery for methane extraction. [37]
25

Figure 3.1: Options for geological carbon storage both onshore and offshore application. [37]

Figure 3.2: Northern lights CCS infrastructure for offshore CO2 injection from, transportation to storage. [38]

26

The retention time for depleted oil and gas reservoirs is >10 million years in some cases, which leads to an
average release fraction of <10-7 per year, in sedimentary basins. Engineered natural gas storage systems
show a retention time for methane of approximately 10-4 to 10-6 per year. Enhanced oil recovery sites that
have measured surface fluxes of CO2 report near zero fractional releases of CO2. Some risk assessment studies
point to an average release rate of 10-5 to 10-7 per year in existing oil wells that have been abandoned.
Simulations have reported open wells to have a release rate of up to 10-2 per year. [37]
The infrastructure is important for geological storage as captured CO2 must be transported to a specific
location where the CO2 will end up. Figure 3.2 shows the Northern lights project [38] full scale CCS project in
Norway. This project is part of the Norwegian government´s ambition to develop a full-scale CCS
infrastructure by 2024. The project includes capture, transport and storage as a project scope. CO2 transport
ships are planned to transport liquified CO2 from the capture source to an onshore CO2 hub. From this hub,
a CO2 pipeline transports the liquified CO2 to a sub-sea bottom storage site. [38]
General infrastructure that needs to be developed and invested in will be CO2 transportation ships and
pipelines for transporting the CO2 from the CO2 emissions source to CO2 hubs. Transportation of CO2 by ships
already exist today but in small scale. The development of shipping and pipeline infrastructure will likely
increase incrementally and in certain geographical areas as a start. CO2 hubs will develop to collect individual
source emitters of CO2. For example, the Northern lights project will include a CO2 hub that collects CO2
emission sources and redistributes the CO2 to a pipeline for transportation to the storage reservoir. As
“economies of scale” are more cost efficient, an incentive for development of transportation networks and
CO2 hubs will emerge as the market develops. [39]
The GATEWAY project [40] aims to develop a large CCS infrastructure in Europe by interacting with
governments and industry stakeholders. The Zero Emission Platform (ZEP), which is a group of industrial
stakeholders, has identified three phases of development of the infrastructure, see Figure 3.3. The first phase
consists of delivering demonstration projects where single CCS projects deliver CO2 to a pipeline that delivers
the CO2 to onshore or offshore storage reservoirs, see Figure 3.3 “Phase 1”. In the second phase, a CO2 hub
is created to collect several CO2 capture sources, and ship transportation is expanded for delivery to other
storage sites, see Figure 3.3 “Phase 2”. In the third phase, the CO2 hub and the amount of storage sites are
expanded, allowing for more storage of CO2. Additionally, ship transportation brings CO2 from remote sites
to the CO2 hub for storage, see Figure 3.3 “Phase 3”. Figure 3.4 shows the potential CCS hubs and the
infrastructure that are being planned around the North Sea. [40]

27

Figure 3.3: Ship transport, pipelines and terminal infrastructure for
Gateway. [40]

Figure 3.4: Potential CCS hubs and infrastructure. [40]

Ocean storage
Ocean storage has great potential for storing large quantities of CO2. As over 70 % of the earth´s surface is
covered by oceans with an average depth of 3800 meters, there is practically no limit of the amount of CO 2
that could be stored. Injecting CO2 deep into the ocean would isolate it from the atmosphere for centuries.
After millions of years, the CO2 injected into the ocean at great depth will reach equilibrium with the
atmosphere, meaning the CO2 has now been released back into the atmosphere. [41]
The retention time of CO2 in the ocean is important as released CO2 from the ocean makes ocean storage
feasible or not. Ocean observations and mathematical models suggest that injected CO2 will be isolated from
the atmosphere for hundreds of years. The depth is important as deeper injection leads to longer retention
time. To prolong the retention time further, the formation of CO2 hydrates and the formation of liquid CO2
lakes on the sea floor prolongs the retention time further. [41]
Harmful effects of increased CO2 levels on marine life have been observed. Observed effects have been
“reduced rates of calcification, reproduction, growth, circulatory oxygen supply and mobility as well as
increased mortality” [41]. The effects are directly dependent on distance to the injection site. Immediate
mortality is expected at injection site and in CO2 lakes. Small increases in CO2 levels in the ocean leads to
chronic harmful effects but not immediate death, primarily as a result of a lowered pH. [41]
28

Figure 3.5 shows the options of transporting CO2 into the ocean for storage. The CO2 is either transported by
ship or pipeline. Creating CO2 lakes could be executed through building pipelines on the sea floor or through
offshore platforms injecting the CO2 to the sea floor through pipes. CO2 lakes must be placed below 3000
meters depth, as liquid CO2 is denser than water below this depth. Another possibility is to inject the CO2
directly into the ocean, where it dissolves, but this has the same effect of not doing any CC, CCS or CCU at all:
natural process try to adjust the equilibrium between atmospheric and ocean-dissolved CO2.1
CO2 ships can either release CO2 through a towed pipe during ocean voyage or discharge it at a platform.
Lastly, carbonates may be formed and transported out to the ocean, for storage on the sea floor, in a stable
carbonate form. [41]

Figure 3.5: Ocean storage options with both pipeline and ship transportation of CO 2 to the ocean storage locations. [41]

Mineral carbonation
The formation of carbonates is a result of the reaction between CO2 and metal oxides. For instance, calcium
and magnesium oxides are widely utilized for mineral carbonation. The carbonation reaction is an exothermic
reaction and favored at low temperatures and at high temperatures, calcination is favored. Calcination begins
at above 900 °C for calcium carbonate and above 300 °C for magnesium carbonate. Carbonation occurs
spontaneously in nature at 25 °C, but at low reaction rates. Increasing the reaction rate is important for

1

29

mineral carbonation to be competitive with other carbon storage processes. Suitable minerals for source
material to the carbonation reaction would be silicate rocks and alkaline industrial residues. Metal oxides
containing potassium and sodium are less suitable as these carbonate products are soluble in water. Oxides
of calcium and magnesium are the most suitable source minerals for the carbonation reaction. Silicate rocks
high in calcium or magnesium are for instance, mafic and ultramafic rocks. The carbon storage of 1-ton CO2
requires 1.6- 3.7-tons of feedstock mineral, depending on the calcium or magnesium oxide percentage of the
feedstock. Higher Mg, Ca or Fe oxide content leads to less feedstock material as more CO2 can react with the
mineral per unit mass. [42]
The environmental impacts of large-scale mineral carbonation would be extensive impact on land clearing
for mining the rocks, air quality around the mines and waste-product disposal. To reduce impacts of land
clearing, storage for topsoil can be reintroduced after excavation, to minimize erosion. Waste products will
need treatment on site, adding to the costs of mining operations. [42]

Figure 3.6: The mineral carbonation process, CO2 is converted into stable carbonates. [42]

Figure 3.6 shows the mineral carbonation process and how it would work practically. Either CO2 will be
transported to the mining location or to the industrial residue location sources, or vice versa depending on
the fate of the solid products. The carbonation products, calcium or magnesium carbonate, can be placed in
storage, be used in the construction industry or sold to other disposal purposes. The sales of the various

30

products is dependent on the cost of transporting the solid materials. Magnesium carbonates could further
be utilized as soil enhancers or for more high-tech applications, as market prices are of the order of 300
$/ton. Usually, after mining operations are finished, the mine is filled with materials to reclaim the land, and
as mentioned before, topsoil can be reintroduced to allow for vegetation to reclaim the land mass. [42]

Industrial uses
Another way of storing CO2 would be as a feedstock for the chemical and polymer industry. The CO2 is stored
by producing valuable carbon-containing fuels and chemicals. To establish the CO2 storing potential and how
long the CO2 will be stored in chemical products, the lifecycle of the product must be determined. If the
carbon product is recycled, the CO2 should remain fixed. Regardless, the short CO2 fixation time excludes CCU
from the methods that aim at CO2 emissions mitigation. [42]
Currently, CO2 is utilized in urea production, refrigeration systems, food packaging, carbonated beverages,
fire extinguishers, horticulture (greenhouses) and calcium carbonate production. The production of
chemicals and polymers is another area where CO2 might be used as a feedstock. As CO2 is highly oxidized,
efficient catalytic materials are required for utilizing CO2 as the feedstock material, instead of the traditional
carbon sources such as carbon monoxide, methane or methanol. The chemicals that can be produced from
CO2 include polyurethanes and polycarbonates. [42]
Fuel production is possible using CO2 as a feedstock along some added energy. For instance, gasoline and
methanol are fuels that could be produced. If the added energy comes from fossil fuel sources, emitting more
CO2 than the amount of CO2 that is converted into fuel, the net impact will be more CO2 emissions. It is thus,
important that the added energy would come from non-fossil fuel sources, such as wind, solar or
hydropower. It would be possible to incorporate hydrogen production through electrolysis from renewables
(power-to-gas) with CO2 and convert it into liquid fuels or methane. This would create a hydrogen economy
utilizing existing infrastructure for gasoline and methanol with CO2 captured from fossil fuel power plants.
[42] However, it must be noted that processing fossil-derived CO2 with hydrogen (either fossil-derived or
renewable) into a synthetic fuel does not mean producing a renewable or zero-emissions fuel but rather
implies the short-term use of CO2 for transport of hydrogen.
Fuels such as methane, methanol, hydrogen and biodiesel can also be produced from microalgae that convert
solar energy, water and CO2 into biomass, through photosynthesis. Elevated concentrations of CO2 would be
introduced to the plants, and when the biomass is fully grown, the carbon containing biomass can be
converted into fuels. Efficiencies are the limiting factors, with agricultural biomass converting about 1 % and
microalgae converting about 2 % of solar energy into biomass. As agricultural areas are utilized for food

31

production, utilizing these areas for fuel production is not realistic on a global scale. The microalgae option
would be more realistic. [42]
The global storage potential in industrial uses is about 0.5 % of the annual global CO2 emissions, see Table
3.1. [42] The market for urea and methanol is predicted to be much higher in 2030 [43]. The prediction of
market size indicates a ten times increase in methanol market size to the year 2030, and for urea that value
is about three times higher, from [43], than the IPCC value [42] from 2005. With these increases in market
demand for CO2, the global storage potential in chemical products might reach around 1-2 % of global annual
CO2 emissions, and thus industrial uses of CO2 will play a small role in the mitigation or storage of
anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The previously mentioned geological, ocean and mineral carbonation options
will play larger roles, especially geological storage. [42]
The source of CO2 can be industrial (calcination and other industrial processes where CO2 is a by-product) or
from natural sources (natural CO2 wells). The lifetime of storage ranges from days to centuries, depending
on application area. Methanol production usually lead to combustion and the subsequent re-release of CO2.
Polyurethanes might be utilized for decades up to centuries depending on recyclability and product use. [42]

Carbon transportation to storage
This section will investigate the transportation of CO2, the purity for transportation and the CO2 phase for
transportation. As mentioned before, carbon transportation in this work refers to the temporary storage of
CO2. Transporting CO2 in solid, liquid, gaseous or supercritical phase will require power and the ultimate
objective is there by, to place the CO2 in for instance, geological formations or as a feedstock for the chemical
industry (long-term storage options). [36]

32

Transportation and purity
The transportation of CO2 is what connects the emission source to the storage location. CO2 is transported
by pipelines either offshore or onshore and by ship. Figure 3.7 shows the transportation costs against the
distance of transportation. Short distances of about 1000 km or less show offshore and onshore pipeline
transportation to be cheaper than shipping. When increasing the transportation distance above 1000 km,
shipping transportation costs become cheaper than pipeline transportation. Onshore transportation is
cheaper than offshore as building pipelines under water presents additional engineering challenges. [36]
Commercial scale CO2 transportation is as mentioned before achieved through pipelines and ships. As CO2 at
atmospheric pressure occupies large volumes it is commonly transported in supercritical phase in pipelines.
To further increase the density of CO2, it can be liquefied or solidified but cooling duties increase.
Solidification of CO2 is the most expensive transportation phase and is there by typically not the preferred
transportation phase for CO2. Liquefaction of CO2 is the preferred technology by the shipping industry as can
be seen also in LPG and LNG transportation. The technology of liquefaction is well established, and
infrastructure exist at present with the required knowledge for creating a CO2 transportation network. [36]

Figure 3.7: Transportation costs against the distance for offshore/onshore pipelines and shipping of CO2. [36]

CO2 purity: Table 3.2 shows the CO2 purity that is required for pipeline CO2 transportation. It can be concluded
that the CO2 purity of above 98-99 wt-% in the MEA, Cansolv and ammonia processes are well within
specification as long as the condensation stage after the stripping process removes almost all water from the
33

CO2 product stream. [44] As the purity of post-combustion CO2 streams is high, the impurities may be
neglected if transport to a storage site needs not be considered . [45]

efficiency considered. [44] [46] The lower limit (vol-%, ppm) was chosen from both articles.

Different approaches can be taken to compress CO2, for instance centrifugal compression, supersonic
shockwave compression and compression with liquefaction and pumping. Centrifugal compressors typically
have a compression ratio of 1.7-2.0:1 and are divided into integrally-geared and single-stage compressors.
Supersonic shockwave compressors are able to reach compression ratios of up to 10-12:1, thus requiring less
stages to reach higher pressures. Supersonic shockwave compressors are more compact and present lower
capital cost than traditional centrifugal compressors. Compression with liquefaction and pumping present
opportunities to lower compression costs as increasing pressure with liquid pumps require less power and
liquid pumps are cheaper than gas compressors. [45]
Transportation of CO2 can be achieved in four different phases, these are supercritical, gas, liquid and solid
phases. Figure 3.8 shows the phase diagram for CO2. Depending on temperature and pressure, the density
of CO2 changes. [6] For instance, density of supercritical CO2 at 35 °C and 125 bars is 757 kg/m3, density of
gaseous CO2 at 30 °C and 60 bars is 172 kg/m3, density of liquid CO2 at -15 °C and 30 bars is 1011 kg/m3 [47]
and density of solid CO2 at -80 °C and 1 bar is 1562 kg/m3 [48].

34

Figure 3.8: Phase diagram of CO2. [6]

Supercritical phase
The supercritical phase is achieved through compression of CO2 above 73 bar (critical pressure) and above
31.1 °C (critical temperature), see Figure 3.8. The supercritical phase or supercritical fluid phase is the
preferred phase for pipeline transportation as it is denser than compressed gas. When CO2 is compressed
above 73 bar and when the temperature is above 31.1 °C, the CO2 behaves as a supercritical fluid. [49] The
typical operating pressure for pipelines is above 96 bars, as it is the cheapest option. Lower pressures than
96 bars can lead to two-phase flows, which are preferably avoided. [36]

Gaseous phase
The gaseous phase is the least dense phase for transporting CO2. The required volume is the limiting factor,
but the pressure and cooling duties are instead low compared to the other phases. The compressed gas phase
is not economical and thus not utilized for transportation of large volumes of CO2.

35

Liquid phase
The liquid phase is denser than gaseous and supercritical CO2. Liquefaction to pressures of 6-7 bar and 15 bar
and temperatures of -50 to -55 °C and -30 °C respectively are utilized in ship transportation. Liquid CO2 in
pipelines are not desired as refrigerated pipelines encounter problems such as technical difficulties and
higher cost than transporting in the supercritical phase. [36] The liquid phase is reached by following the
temperature and pressure lines above the triple point (see Figure 3.8), up to the point of critical pressure and
critical temperature, where liquid CO2 phase changes to the supercritical fluid phase. [49]

Solid phase
The solid phase is the densest CO2 phase. The sublimation point at 1 bar and -78.5 °C (see Figure 3.8) is the
point where solid CO2 can phase change directly into the gaseous phase from solid phase, hence it is called
dry ice as the liquid phase cannot exist at atmospheric pressure. The triple point is where CO2 can phase
change between solid, liquid and gaseous phases. The triple point exists at 5.2 bar and -56.4 °C. [49]
Another solid storage phase for CO2 is solid carbonates, where CO2 through carbonation can be stored and
transported in carbonates of Ca or Mg, most suitably. See “Mineral carbonation” previously in this Chapter
for more information.

36

4. Economic analysis
To determine the cost of captured CO2 (CCCO2), the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure
(OPEX) need to be calculated. The total annual cost (TAC) is calculated from adding the annual CAPEX
(ACAPEX), variable OPEX (VOPEX) and fixed OPEX (FOPEX) together, see eq. 4.2, and dividing that by the
annual CO2 emissions captured. The CCCO2 is now obtained, see eq. 4.1. [50]

Cost of captured CO2:
•

CCCO2 =

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 (𝑇𝐴𝐶)
𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐶𝑂2 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦

(eq.4.1) [50]

Total annual cost:
•

TAC = ACAPEX + VOPEX + FOPEX

(eq.4.2) [50]

CAPEX
The total CAPEX value is calculated from the total equipment cost. From the equipment cost, total direct
plant costs (TDPC) and total indirect plant costs (TIPC) can be estimated, see Table 4.1. This estimation is
based on the “European Best Practice Guidelines for Assessment of CO2 Capture Technology”, utilized in
article [51].
The TDPC includes total process equipment cost, installation of equipment, instrumentation & controls,
piping, electrical equipment and materials, civil works and solvent. These direct costs are estimated from the
total process equipment cost, except the solvent cost that is calculated in the Excel tool, see Chapter 6.
The TIPC includes yard improvements, service facilities, engineering and supervision and building costs. These
costs arrive from surrounding yard, service facilities and ship build changes (indirect costs) for the direct
installment of the CC system (direct costs).
The value “X” is utilized as equipment cost in this thesis as the scope of this thesis is calculation of different
CCS system sizes. This total CAPEX calculation will be present in Chapter 6, in section “M. Outputs” (for the
Excel tool). The TDPC value “Y” is utilized in the TIPC section as the total direct cost parameter. The TIPC value
“Z” is utilized as the total indirect cost parameter.

When the total CAPEX is determined, the annual CAPEX cost can be estimated by including the capital
recovery factor, see eq. 4.3 and 4.4. The lifetime (n) of the CCS system is assumed to be 25 years and the
interest rate (i) is assumed to be 8 %. [50]

OPEX
OPEX is divided into FOPEX and VOPEX. The (fixed) FOPEX is estimated using eq. 4.5. FOPEX includes “longterm service agreements, overhead costs, operation and maintenance costs and other costs related to the
CCS system when it is running or not”, independent from running status. Instead, the VOPEX takes the
running conditions into account. The (variable) VOPEX includes cost of electricity consumption, extra fuel
consumption and solvent make-up. The cooling and heating duties are included in the electricity and fuel
consumption costs. The electricity consumption of the CC system is covered by increasing the fuel
consumption of the installed engines onboard the vessel. The heating duty for regenerating the solvent in
the stripper column is supplied by a reboiler running on oil or gas, thus it is based on fuel consumption. The
fuel price and the solvent prices are thus required for calculating the VOPEX, see eq.4.6. [50]

Carbon transportation
The costs of transporting CO2 have been discussed in Chapter 3, “Carbon transportation”. Figure 3.7 shows
the costs for onshore, offshore and ship transportation of CO2. In this thesis, the distance of CO2
transportation from CO2 discharge from the vessel to the final location (long-term storage or selling of the
CO2) is assumed to be 1000 kilometers at maximum. [36] The costs of transporting CO2 are shown in Table
4.2.
Article [52] investigated the transportation of CO2 in the Nordic region, with transportation distances ranging
from 180-1900 kilometers. It is important to take the volume and distance for transportation of CO2 into
account, transportation costs from small emission sources and sources far away from injection sites will
increase the transportation costs quite much. The transportation distances Preem-Gassum, RautaruukkiFaludden and Hvidovre-Gassum, see Table 4.2, show the impact of transportation distance and cost. Shorter
39

distances show less cost for pipeline transportation. Longer distances (1000km) show less cost for ship
transportation. The volume of CO2 transportation impacts the costs such that more metric tons of CO2/ year
lead to less transportation costs for pipelines. For ship transportation, costs increase slowly as the distance
increases. It was concluded in [52] that when dealing with small quantities of captured CO2, ship
transportation will be cheaper than pipeline transportation. [52]

Carbon storage
The costs of storing CO2 long-term are shown in Table 4.3. The storage options are geological storage, ocean
storage and mineral carbonation, as mentioned in Chapter 3. The geological storage costs are for saline
formations, depleted oil/gas fields and for disused oil/gas fields for both onshore and offshore applications.
Ocean storage implies for offshore platforms, moving ships and from pipeline on depths of 3000 meters. The
mineral carbonation storage options are the most expensive as a lot of energy is required for the carbonation
process, although this can be offset by the fact that carbonation processes can operate on flue gases directly,
removing the energy penalty of CO2 pre-separation. The most viable option appears to be geological storage
and especially onshore geological storage. Ocean storage, while being highly controversial, appears to be
competitive with offshore geological storage but not in the lower cost ranges, so depending on the location
of offshore geological storage, the conditions for geological storage might increase in cost such that ocean
storage become cheaper.

Carbon capture and utilization
Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) relates to the capturing and to the usage of CO2 for production of
chemicals, plastics and fuels, cement and more see Chapter 3, “Industrial uses”. [53]. Considering the yearly
industrial uses of CO2 being around 100-150 million tons of CO2 per year, the potential for the early
deployment of CCS, might present economic incentives for selling the CO2 to methanol and urea production
industries. EOR is another area where CO2 can be sold, with prices ranging from 5-30 $/ton CO2, depending
on oil, gas or coal bed location [37].

Financial incentives
Onshore: Without a sufficient CO2 price, public financial support is required. For instance, tax credits,
government support for mitigating cross-chain risks, accreditation schemes for decarbonized products and
contracts-for-difference can be utilized for early CCS development. [54]
Tax credits are used in the US, where the 45Q tax credits finances power plants for every ton of CO 2 stored
in geological formations (35 or 50 $/ton CO2 stored). [54]
41

The cross-chain risks of early CCS infrastructure will require government funding. For instance, the Northern
Lights Project in Norway provides mitigation of risk for companies to develop, as the infrastructure builds up
with government support funding, economies of scale lead to less risk and cheaper transportation and
storage costs, at the same time more companies will possibly move into the market. [54]
Accreditation schemes aim to support decarbonized products with certification systems. The EU´s Green
Public Procurement framework would in this case, on public purchasing power level, buy decarbonized
products and support decarbonization development within the union. It would thus, be a certification system
for buyers to choose regular products or decarbonized products through certification and is thus, a voluntary
mechanism for supporting decarbonization development in industries. [54]
For electricity generators, contracts-for difference would provide the difference in cost to cover for the CCS
system incorporated into electricity generation. Public financial support would there by create incentives for
investing in CCS systems in the power sector without extra cost. This is important as resilience in the power
grid will be important as renewables enter into the electricity market. [54]

Offshore (international shipping): For the marine industry, currently there are no emissions trading systems
regulations. The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) is utilized in international shipping for improving
energy efficiency and for reducing pollution. The EEDI is mandatory for new ships to operate. The “Phase 3”
of the EEDI will enter into effect in 2022, when large container ships, gas carriers, general cargo ships and
LNG carriers (15 000-200 000+ deadweight tonnage) will be required to be 30-50 % more energy efficient
than the baseline. The 200 000+ DWT ships will have to comply to a 50 % reduction in the EEDI. A possible
“Phase 4” might be possible in the near future, when more ship types need to comply with EEDI reductions.
[55]
Market based mechanisms (MBM) were proposed around 2005-2010 by member states of the IMO, most of
these MBMs were suspended after impact assessment studies. The proposed MBMs were for instance global
emission trading systems, international funds and credit trading systems. Ship and vessel efficiency systems
were also proposed in the MBMs proposals. [56] The EEDI was made mandatory in 2011 and is today, the
MBM to lower emissions in the international shipping industry. [57]

It can be concluded that for the shipping industry, the market driver for implementing GHG emissions
reductions will be related to the EEDI. The possibility of carbon taxes on emissions seem implausible. Selling
the CO2 might be the only option for getting compensated for capturing CO2. For building new ships, the
requirement of the EEDI will lead to emission reductions. Ships that do not meet the EEDI requirement can
42

be denied port entry, leading to shipping companies complying with emission reductions and improving their
EEDI.
In this thesis, the assumption is that no compensation is obtained for capturing CO2 in international shipping.
Compensation for capturing CO2 onshore seems more probable as nation states might compensate
companies within their country. Building new ships where the EEDI is strict, the implementation of CCS
systems will be required and invested in, if there are no other cheaper options.

43

5. Carbon capture on marine vessels
Carbon capture and storage on marine vessels encounters problems such as, limited space onboard, the
storage of CO2 onboard, limited utilities and the constant movement of the vessel, see Table 5.1. The most
mature technology for capturing CO2 is the absorption post-combustion CC technology. [50]
The equipment that occupies most space onboard the vessel will be the absorption column and the stripper
column. Higher packing bed columns benefits the CO2 removal efficiency but a column height of greater than
20 meters will be difficult to install even on medium to large sized marine vessels. The design of these
columns can be solved by increasing the diameter of the column, see Chapter 6 “MEA, Cansolv and Ammonia
(H., I., J., K. and L.)”, section “10. Absorber and stripper column design” for design considerations. [50]
Additionally, the storage tanks for CO2 and amine make-up will occupy a lot of space. The size of the CO2
tanks will be impacted by the voyage length, longer voyages will lead to larger tanks. The place for discharging
CO2 will be either at onshore CO2 hubs or at offshore platforms, see Chapter 3. [50]
Table 5.1: Limitations of CC on marine vessels. [50]
Problem:

Limitation:

Constant movement of vessel

Vibrations impact on equipment

The limitation of heat supply, electricity and cooling water will impact the vessel as well. Heat and electricity
can be supplied by the engines already installed, to a certain point. Oil or gas-fired boilers will have to be
installed for supplying additional heat (steam). The electricity supply can be increased by installing more
engines for generating more electric power, at the expanse of more exhaust gas emissions. Another option
is to increase the engine load of already installed engines for covering the electricity demand. Cooling water
can be supplied by utilizing sea water and the power demand could thus, be reduced as heat exchangers can
be used for cooling duties. [50]
The CCS system will also be impacted by the constant movement of the vessel, especially by vibration. This
thesis will not investigate this problem and is thus out of scope. [50]

Equipment placement
In [51] the process equipment placement on a ship was investigated. The placement of the exhaust gas cooler
tower, absorber, stripper and heat exchangers were placed in the funnel, where the exhaust gas chimneys
are located, see Figure 5.2 and 5.3. The CO2 storage tanks were placed near the LNG tanks. The MSc thesis
investigated the placement of a potential CC system on a general cargo vessel. The displacement of the vessel
has to be considered, as a CC system will add weight onboard the vessel and storing CO 2 will further add
weight. The displacement is not considered in this thesis and should therefore, be investigated separately
with weight of a total CC system available. [51]
The retrofit option is more complicated than planning a CC system on a new ship build. The height and
diameter of a column can be designed to fit the funnel section. For instance, in Figure 5.2, the funnel section
where the columns will be placed, about ten meters of column height can be installed. The height of the
column is reduced when lowering the capture percentage. With larger exhaust gas mass flows, the diameter
of the column increases, see absorber and stripper design in Chapter 6. Space for process equipment such as
compressors, condensers, pumps, screw chillers, thermal reclaiming units, CO2 tanks and solvent tanks is
required inside the vessel. For larger engine installations, the space and column sizes increase almost linearly
with larger engine installed power, meaning more exhaust gas entering the CC system.

Figure 5.3: The placement of equipment from above, exhaust gas cooler tower (1.), absorber (2.), stripper (3.), heat exchangers (4.),
compression and liquefaction equipment (5.) and CO2 tanks (6.), from [51].

Start-up and shutdown
The start-up of a CC system will lead to a capture rate decline after about 40 minutes of operation, seen in
pilot scale demonstration in [59]. This occurs due to the stripper temperature being too low, as the reboiler
do not supply enough steam for the stripping process, see Figure 5.4. The top graph (Figure 5.4), shows the
reboiler being started a short time before the engines, for earlier supply of steam to the stripper column
(capture rate still declines). The solvent flow rate is at 50 % from the baseline, before the engines and
reboilers are started, 100 % baseline being maximum CC system operation. The engines are ramped up slowly
in this case: for a fast ramp up of the engines, the reboiler has to be started approximately 20-40 minutes
before the engines are started, this is however difficult to approximate and investigations into fast ramp-ups
are required. [59]
The problem with the stripper column temperature being too low is related to the rich solvent not being
stripped from CO2, the loading of the lean solvent entering the absorber column is then too high for capturing
the CO2 in the exhaust gas and as a result, more CO2 is emitted when the exhaust gas leaves the absorber
column, see bottom graph (Figure 5.4). [59]
When the engine load is changed during voyage, the liquid/gas ratio (L/G) has to be kept the same, meaning
a smaller exhaust gas flow leads to less steam consumption and solvent flow rate. The pumps and reboiler
can now be reduced from baseline operation to the engine load baseline, see Appendix B.1. [59]
When the engines are shut down, the reboiler and lean solvent flow rate are reduced similarly, see Appendix
B.2. The rich and lean solvent loadings fall rapidly after the exhaust gas from the engines stop, as the rich
solvent is still stripped in the stripper column and no CO2 is absorbed in the absorber column. [59]
47

Figure 5.4: Start-up of a CC system and the system response. [59]

48

The reboiler and pumps are the most important equipment to control for operation of the CC system. With
fast ramp-ups of engines, for instance 1-2 minutes of ramp-up to 100 % baseline level, the reboiler may have
to be running beforehand. The disadvantage of this approach is the fuel consumption for the anticipation of
engine operation. The alternative is a relatively large capture rate drop when the engines are operated at
100 % baseline level and the reboiler is started when also the engines are started. The capture rate drop will
in this case be larger than in Figure 5.4.
Other sources such as [60] state a start-up time of 2.54h for a hot start, study performed as a theoretical
modelling simulation with steam flow rate, solvent flow rate and total amount of solvent as variables. [60]
For the small demonstration plant in [59], the total start-up time is around 100 minutes, with 40 minutes of
full capture rate and a later decline. [59] These two studies show a high uncertainty between 1 hour to 2.54
hours of start-up time. The conditions of operation are not the same for both articles, in this thesis these
conditions will not be explained as the start-up times are utilized for pointing out the need for further
investigations. Especially into the 1-2-minute engine ramp-ups of up to 100 % baseline, the impact it will have
on the capture rate will be even greater than before mentioned studies.

Operational route
The operational route of the vessel will impact the storage amount. For vessels operating on long distances,
the amount of CO2 storage onboard the ship will be larger. The voyage time will also impact the start-up and
shutdown of the CC system. Shorter voyage distances will lead to less storage amount onboard the vessel,
but it will also lead to many start-ups and shutdowns of the CC system. To the contrary, long voyage distances
will lead to larger storage amounts onboard the vessel but the operation of the CC system will be less difficult
as the operational load will be less variable.
Solving the short distance problem, as mentioned before, the reboiler might be ramped-up long before the
engines are operated, the capture rate will still drop but not as much as the case where reboilers are started
shortly before the engines are started. Further investigations are needed to determine to optimal system
operation regarding the reboiler start-up and the capture rate fall impact on total capture rate for vessel
operation. The solvent flow rate will be easier to operate, as the L/G ratio should be kept constant. Reducing
exhaust gas mass flow leads to a higher L/G ratio, the solvent flow should then be reduced to match the L/G
ratio during engine load change during a voyage.

6. Excel tool
The most important features of the Excel tool (ET) that accompanies this thesis will be estimations about
cost, footprint and power requirements for a marine CC system. The users will be able to enter data for their
own engine setups on a vessel either through adding existing Wärtsilä engines or through assuming a
“theoretical engine” where engine information is given as input data by the users themselves. Existing
Wärtsilä engines can be found in [61] and the information is already present in the tool. On the other hand,
the “theoretical engine” mentioned above can be specified by the users, allowing them to use their own
parameters, these will be discussed in “C. Engine exhaust calculations” Chapter.
This tool will not provide exact CC system sizes and costs but as mentioned above, provides well-motivated
and theoretically sound guiding estimations. The error margin should be in the region of -20 % to 20 %
overestimation or underestimation.
Liquid and gas properties such as densities, enthalpies and viscosities at different temperatures are already
entered into the tool and will not be provided in this thesis. Reason being the amount of information and the
customizability of the ET, values present in the ET are accurate but too much time has not been spent in
proofing these values. The references for the information are sourced and can be checked. As mentioned
before, the error area should not be larger than +/- 20 % as is the scope overall. It is possible to increase
accuracy overtime, by for example, verifying/checking values more accurately and better assumption values.
Assumptions for exhaust gas compositions, temperatures, pressures and mass flows are made for
information not provided by literature sources. Assumptions in the ET can be seen as “Assumed” values in
tables. These “Assumed” values are made by the developer of the tool and can thereby be changed. Heating
and cooling energy transfers are assumed to be 100 % efficient (heat balance). The Cansolv DC-103 solvent
is a proprietary solvent and thereby, information cannot be found in the public domain. The properties of
DC-103 are assumed and not completely accurate. Some sources can be utilized for the assumption of DC103 properties, as it is often compared to MEA, these are described in the ET.
The objectives of the Excel tool are to detail process conditions such as mass flow, temperature and pressure
in the CC system. These conditions are already present in worksheets “H. MEA”, “I. MEA+LVC”, “J. Cansolv”,
“K. Cansolv+ LVC” and “L. Ammonia”. Solvent information, reclaiming of the solvent, steam requirement,
cooling duties, heat exchanger requirements, absorber and stripper column design and carbon storage are
also included in these worksheets. Process equipment are gathered in mass flows, temperature ranges and
pressure ranges to dimension every process equipment specifically for every engine installation entered.
This Excel tool is designed for engine installations from 0.7 MWel up to 100 MWel. The largest passenger vessel
in the world is “Symphony of the Seas” owned by Royal Caribbean International. [62] This vessel has an
50

installed power output of around 100 MWel, with two W16V46F and four W12V46F, both engine
configurations are diesel electric (DE). Even the largest container vessels in the world do not require this
engine output, could be explained by the electricity consumption of passengers onboard passenger vessels
as large as “Symphony of the Seas”.

Worksheets
In this section, the worksheets will be presented. All worksheets in the Excel tool contain specific information
and perform specific calculations. All worksheets except “A. Dashboard” contain already entered data and
calculations. The only place the users input data are in “A. Dashboard” and on the top page of “C. Engine
exhaust calculations”, where a “theoretical engine” can be entered. The theoretical engine input was placed
in the “C. Engine exhaust calculation” worksheet to reduce the “A. Dashboard” content.
❖ The Excel tool is called “ET” to shorten references to tables in the Excel tool, for instance the exhaust gas
composition table in “B. Exhaust gas, SCR, WHR” is called ET B.3.1, meaning Table B.3.1 in Chapter B.3 in
worksheet B. (“B. Exhaust gas, SCR, WHR”) in the ET (Excel tool), thereby named ET B.3.1.

A. Dashboard
Inputs that are required will be present in worksheet “A. Dashboard” in the ET. The operational profile is
entered as input data for carbon storage calculations and emissions calculations. Carbon storage onboard
the vessel is entered by the users as discharge of CO2 might not be possible at every harbor. Information
about scrubbers and waste heat recovery (WHR) systems already installed are also required, will impact CC
process conditions such as temperature of exhaust gas entering and reboiler duty.
The engine installed capacity onboard the vessel is entered by choosing engine amount, maximum engine
load for CC, engine configuration, rpm type, IMO Tier type, fuel type and speed mode type. “Maximum engine
load for CC” refers to at what load the engines will be operating on. For instance, a vessel with the load profile
(100 %: 0h, 85 %: 10h, 75 %: 1h and 50 %:1h) will choose 85 % engine load for the exhaust gas mass flow at
maximum and thus, be able to capture for example 90 % of the CO2 emissions most efficiently. Designing the
CC system for 100 % engine load would be unnecessary as the extra capacity of the CC system would not be
utilized.
The “Add Engine” button, inputs the engine selection and engine amount into tables and automatically
calculates everything in the Excel tool. The “Filters reset” button can be utilized to reset all filters previously
clicked on. The “Remove engine data” button removes all engines entered in the ET.

51

Figure 6.1: A. Dashboard worksheet, with “input” areas (orange boxes), “results” areas (green boxes) and “economical values” area
(blue box).

How to add inputs for the CC system calculations, see Figure 6.1:
1. Operational profile
❖ To be entered in hours operated on a certain engine load of a specific engine configuration. This selection
impacts the CO2 emissions and captured CO2 during one “operational profile” voyage. If the operational
profile is entered with a total of 5 hours, the CO2 emissions result shown will be five hours of emissions
as well and five hours of captured CO2 also.

2. CO2 storage
❖ To be entered in hours of storage onboard the vessel. This can be for one voyage as specified in the
operational profile or for longer. Time spent in harbor is entered for providing details about how much
time is needed for CO2 discharge from the temporary storage tanks onboard the vessel.

3. CO2 capture
❖ Capture percentage is entered for specifying how much CO2 is required to be captured by the system.
Can be chosen at 5-90 wt-% capture rates. The exhaust gas mass flow can also be chosen. For instance,
50 % exhaust gas mass flow can be chosen with 90 % capture rate, this would equal a total capture

52

percentage of 45 % as half of the exhaust gas enters the absorber column and the rest, is released
immediately to the atmosphere. Exhaust gas flow can be chosen from 5-100 %.

Adding an engine:
4. Engine number
❖ The number of engines of a certain engine configuration is entered here. This input provides information
to ET D.1.

5. Engine selection
❖ These Excel “slicers” (pivot table filters) are filters for adding engine information. All slicers are required
to be pressed on, as two or more engines can still be present when only filtering four slicers or less. If all
five slicers are pressed, it always leads to one engine configuration, which provides exhaust gas
composition specifically for that engine configuration.
These five slicers are “Engine configurations:”, “Fuel type:”, IMO Tier, ME/DE/AE:”, “Speed mode:” and
“RPM type:”. The “Engine configurations:” slicer contains all Wärtsilä marine solutions engines and the
two assumed engines. Always choose engine configuration first as this will lead to filtered fuel, IMO Tier,
speed mode, and rpm types. These slicers filter the pivot Table ET D.2.

6. Press “Add engine” button
❖ After choosing engine and engine number in 5 and 6, add the engine configuration with the “Add engine”
green button.
This button with the hidden macro “EngineAdd” exports information from ET D.2 to the Table ET D.1,
later it is transferred to ET D.3 as information to pivot Table ET B.1.

7. Press “Filters reset” button
❖ After adding an engine, filters can be reset by pressing the “Filters reset” blue button. The macro is called
“RemoveFiltering”.

Adding more engine configurations:
❖ Repeat steps 4-7.
53

Remove all engines entered:
8. Press “Remove engine data” button
❖ If some inputs are wrong or if a new engine installation is desired, the only option is to delete all engines
entered into the tool. To delete these engines, press the “Remove engine data” orange button. The
macro here, is called “RemoveData”.

Mass flows:
9. Maximum mass flow selection
❖ This filter provides the maximum exhaust gas mass flow that may enter the CC system. For instance, if a
vessel operates on 75 % engine load, the exhaust gas mass flow should be set at 75 %, as this is what the
CC system is required to handle, in terms of exhaust gas mass flows entering. Both filters in this section
are required to be selected, should be selected at the same engine load. If the engines are running at 75
% at most, 75 % engine load on both filters should be chosen. These slicers filter Tables ET B.3.3 and
B.2.5, determine the exhaust gas mass flow entering the CC system from the engines and the available
WHR and cooling duty of exhaust gas additionally.

10. Reboiler fuel type
❖ There are two fuel types that can be selected, these are HFO and LNG. For engines running on HFO, the
logical choice for reboiler fuel would be HFO, as the same fuel tanks could be utilized.
Slicer from ET B.4.6.

Calculate/update:
11. Press “Calculate” button
❖ Updating the tables in the ET is required also, press the “Calculate” button after everything is entered.
Pivot tables are important in this tool as these tables provide filtering of relatively large information
tables. Some tables on “A. Dashboard” will not update unless this button is pressed. The macro utilized
is called “RefreshPivotTables”.

Scrubbers and WHR installed:
12. Scrubbers and WHR already installed
54

❖ “Engines” and “Amount” columns are updated by the tool to specify what engine and how many of a
certain engine configuration have been entered, “Scrubbers” and “WHR” columns are preset to zero. If
the users have scrubbers installed, they enter the number of scrubbers on a certain engine configuration,
in the “SCR” column (both SOx and NOx). A scrubber will reduce the amount of exhaust gas cooling
required, before the exhaust gas enters the CC system. WHR already installed is entered to provide
details about how much exhaust gas can be utilized for steam generation, to reduce reboiler size, power
and heat consumption, entered in the “WHR” column.

B. Exhaust gas, SCR and WHR
This worksheet is divided into four sections:

B.1. Engine selection filter, see Figure 6.2:
The pivot table shows the filtered engine selections with all CO2 mass flows, exhaust gas flows, CO2 weight%, available WHR, average exhaust gas temperature, fuel consumption, emissions and captured CO2 and
engine total output for all engine loads (100 %, 85 %, 75 % and 50 %). This table is utilized by ET B.2, ET B.3
and ET B.4 sections in the same worksheet. The pivot table information is collected from Table ET D3.

Figure 6.2: The B.1 Engine selection filter section, table is divided into three as it is very wide.

55

B.2. Scrubbers and WHR, see Figure 6.3:
The number of SCR (scrubbers) and WHR units will impact the exhaust gas temperature and the heat available
for steam generation, as mentioned before. The exhaust gas cooling process for CC can be removed if a SCR
unit is installed as the temperature of the exhaust gas exiting the SCR unit is about 40 °C. The cooling cost is
thereby transferred to the SCR unit and this is not in the scope of this thesis. WHR units installed, remove the
option to utilize the exhaust gas heat for steam generation. The input choices on “A. Dashboard” impact the
cooling requirements of exhaust gas and the WHR option for reducing boiler size for steam generation.

Figure 6.3: The scrubbers and WHR filtering tables and calculation tables.

In this section, Table ET B.2.2 shows available WHR and exhaust gas not cooled. Table ET B.2.3 shows the
inputs from “A. Dashboard” and additionally engine, output and amount from ET B.1. Table ET B.2.4 shows
from left to the right, engine information, installed units, exhaust gas from engine, exhaust gas that is
required to be cooled and furthest to the right the exhaust gas available for WHR. This table is utilized for
calculating the exhaust gas not cooled and WHR available and as the source table for ET B.2.5, which is the
source for information to Table ET B.2.2.

B.3 Exhaust gas composition, see Figure 6.4:
This section contains assumed exhaust gas compositions, see Table ET B.3.1. In this thesis, exhaust gas is
assumed to be 76 wt-% nitrogen, 5 wt-% oxygen, 0.5 wt-% contaminants (NOx, SOx) based on [63], see Table
6.1. CO2 content is determined through calculations in “C. Engine exhaust calculations” worksheet, the
remaining content of the exhaust gas is water, see Table 6.1. Water wt-% in the exhaust gas is calculated by
adding weight percentages of nitrogen, oxygen, contaminants and CO2 together and subtracting that with
100 %.

56

The accuracy of the exhaust gas calculation and assumed composition is low. Nitrogen, oxygen, water and
contaminants mass flows in the ET are assumed to leave the CC process with the exhaust gas, the need for
exact exhaust gas composition is thus simplified away. The degradation rate of the solvent, involving oxygen
and contaminants reactions are considered through the degradation rate and accounted for. This approach
simplifies the calculations in the ET, as no dissolved oxygen and contaminants react with the solvent however,
the degradation rate do account for these reactions.

gas example).

The mass flows of exhaust gas are calculated in ET B.3.2 by utilizing assumed exhaust gas composition in ET
B.3.1 and multiplying with total exhaust gas flow in ET B.1. Both assumed exhaust gas and exhaust gas mass
flows are calculated for all engine loads (100 %, 85 %, 75 % and 50 %).

Figure 6.4: Exhaust gas composition calculations and filtering tables.

57

B.4 Reboiler sizing, see Figure 6.5 and 6.6:
To determine the final exhaust gas mass flow entering the CC system, the reboiler size is required as exhaust
gas will be coming from the engines and from a reboiler. The sizing of a reboiler becomes a looping problem,
as an installed reboiler will increase the amount of exhaust gas in the system. To solve this, four tables are
created, namely ET B.4.1-B.4.4, see Figure 6.5. The thermal energy of the reboiler is calculated through an
equation obtained from ET E.12 (boiler equipment). The only variable in the equation is total CO2 emissions
in tons CO2/h. As these CO2 emissions increase, the thermal energy of the reboiler increases as well, leading
to the mentioned looping problem. After four iterations the reboiler is correctly sized. The reboiler size
calculation subtracts the WHR heat available, if there is WHR heat available, the size of the reboiler is
reduced, leading to less emissions.
Table ET B.4.1 calculates the reboiler size for engine exhaust gas only. Table ET B.4.2 adds the reboiler
emissions from Table ET B.4.1+ engines emissions that has been calculated. The added emissions of the
reboiler in Table ET B.4.2 are calculated in Table ET B.4.3 in the same way, the emissions increase slightly
after this point and no more tables are created.

Figure 6.5: The reboiler sizing iterations, four total iterations in B.4.1-B.4.4 for determining reboiler size.

The fuel type and exhaust gas mass flow from the reboiler are then calculated. The exhaust gas is calculated
in the same way as before, for the engines. The exhaust gas is assumed to be 76 wt-% nitrogen, 5 wt-%
oxygen, 0.5 wt-% other (NOx, SOx), the CO2 content in the HFO fuel case 8 wt-% and for LNG fuel 7 wt-% and
the rest is water content, see ET B.4.5. The fuel type is later filtered in ET B.4.6.

C. Engine exhaust calculations
C.1 The own parameters case, see Figure 6.7:
The assumed engines that the users can enter data into themselves, are present in ET C.1. This section is
divided into assumed diesel and gas engine (ET C.1.1 and C.1.2).
❖ Required inputs for assumed engines are: Engine output, fuel conversion factor, fuel type, LHV of fuel,
exhaust gas flow in specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) or brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC).
❖ Inputs that can be left as they are: Exhaust gas temperature and composition (can be changed by user if
wanted).

59

C.2 Parameters utilized in calculations in C.3, see Figure 6.8:
Section ET C.2 contains information that is utilized in Table ET C.3. The Table ET C.2 values are utilized in WHR
calculations that are performed in ET C.3.9 and in ET C.3.5 when calculating CO2 emissions during a voyage
from harbor to harbor. Another value that is specified in section ET C.2 is the LHV of LNG, utilized in ET C.3.3
fuel consumption calculations for gas engines.

Figure 6.8: Assumed parameters for calculations.

CO2 emissions calculations:
In order to calculate the mass flows into the absorber, exhaust gas composition is calculated in ET C.3.1-C.3.9.
Wärtsilä engine information can be found in the Excel tool under the worksheet “C. Engine exhaust
calculations”. Engine information required are engine output, SFOC or BSFC for all engine loads, fuel type,
conversion factor Cf and exhaust gas flow for all engine loads. Information about engines are obtained from
[61].
Engine loads will be utilized to design the maximum flow of CO2 that the CC system is required to capture,
according to the user inputs. The capture percentage can be entered into the tool, as users have different
requirements for emissions reductions of CO2. This capture percentage decrease will reduce the CC system
size, especially important if space onboard a vessel is highly restricted, which it is quite typical. It is possible
to change the capture percentage or the exhaust gas mass flow entering depending on if height of column
or diameter of column is desired to be reduced, see “10. Absorber and stripper column design” Chapter.
CO2 emissions are calculated for all engine loads (100 %, 85 %, 75 % and 50 %). The equations utilized can be
seen below, as eq. 6.1-6.3. Equation 6.1 is utilized for calculating CO2 emissions in metric tons of CO2/h for
diesel engines. The equation utilized for gas engines will be different as the SFOC is measured in BSFC, the
lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel is there for also utilized. The wt-% of CO2 in the exhaust gas is calculated
through dividing CO2 emissions with the exhaust gas flow stated in the product guide for each Wärtsilä
60

engine. The engine output stated in the product guide is assumed to be 100 % efficient, regardless of
electrical or mechanical propulsion utilized, further development can increase accuracy in this area.

C.3 Engine exhaust calculations, see Figure 6.9:
Section ET C.3 is a calculation table and a table for entering engine data. Engine data is entered from left to
the right and calculations are performed after the data has been entered. Section ET C.3.1 contains the
Wärtsilä engine configurations and specific characteristics associated to every type of engine. This section is
directly related to step 5 in the “A. Dashboard”, as the slicer filters utilize this information for engine
selection. In ET C.3.2 output for every engine load is calculated. In the engines´ product guide, 100 % engine
load output is provided in MW, all other engine loads are calculated by taking the engine load percentage
multiplied by the 100 % output load value.
Fuel consumption is calculated in ET C.3.3. Firstly, by providing the SFOC or BSFC and then multiplying that
with engine output at every engine load, see eq. 6.1 and 6.2. As mentioned before, gas engines utilize the
BSFC and there for utilize the LHV in their calculations, which can be seen in eq. 6.2. Fuel consumption is
converted from the SFOC and BSFC to fuel consumption in kg fuel per hour.
Table C.3.4 contain the conversion factors of the specific fuel utilized. These conversion factors are provided
by the IMO. The equations 6.1 and 6.2 are from the same IMO source [64].
The results in CO2 emissions can be seen in Table ET C.3.5, in tons CO2 per hour. The CO2 emissions
calculations of equations 6.1 and 6.2 are stretched over ET C.3.3-C.3.5, performed in segments to output
61

both fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. When CO2 emissions are identified, the emissions during one
voyage of the vessel can be determined.

C.3.1, C.3.3 (half), C.3.4, C.3.6 and C.3.8. Calculations made in C.3.2, C.3.3 (half), C.3.5, C.3.6 (half), C.3.7 and C.3.9.

Exhaust gas flow is another component that is required to be determined, see ET C.3.6. The exhaust gas flow
is obtained from the engine product guide, and converted from kg/s to metric tons/h. This exhaust gas flow
is utilized for determining the CO2 wt-% of the exhaust gas, see eq. 6.3. Table ET C.3.7 shows the CO2 wt-%
calculated. Table ET C.3.8 shows the exhaust gas temperatures after leaving the engine turbocharger.

𝑘𝐽

❖ Q exhaust gas (kW) = exhaust gas ( 𝑠 ) * C exhaust gas 600K (𝑘𝑔∗𝐾 ) * ΔT (exhaust in - exhaust out) (K) (eq.6.4)

WHR is calculated in ET C.3.9 by utilizing eq. 6.4. [51] The specific heat capacity, C, of the exhaust gas is
present in ET C.2 and set at 1.051 kJ/(kg*K) at 600 K (326.85 °C) [65] and assumed to be constant for
simplification. The temperature range for exhaust gas entering the WHR units are 380- 250 °C (653.15- 523.15
K). Exhaust gas is further assumed to be cooled down to 130 °C (exhaust out) and exhaust in is the temperatures
in ET C.3.8. Additionally, WHR is assumed to be 100 % efficient and all heat from the exhaust gas can be
utilized for steam generation.

D. Engine filter
The pivot Table ET D.2 (Figure 6.10) collects all the information from ET C.3 and filters all engine configuration
information and calculations. Specifically, the slicers for engine selection in step 5 in “A. Dashboard” are
created in this pivot table. When filtering all slicers in step 5 in “A. Dashboard”, one engine configuration
remains, pressing “Add engine” button transports this information from Table ET D.2 to Table ET D.1. Here,
the engine amount is multiplied with transported information from Table ET D.2. For instance, if there are
62

two engines chosen for one engine configuration, Table ET D.1 multiplies the engine amount with the case
for one engine and thus provides the correct amount of exhaust gas for the engine(s) selection. When the
number of engine(s) has been considered, the information from Table ET D.1 is transported to Table ET D.3.
This table distributes information about engine selection, exhaust gas mass flow, CO2 emissions mass flow,
CO2 wt-%, WHR available and exhaust gas temperature to “A. Dashboard” and to Table ET B.1 in “B. Exhaust
gas, SCR, WHR” sections.

Figure 6.10: D.1 showing engine amount consideration, D.2 showing data from C.3 and D.3 is the Table B.1 data source.

E. Equipment
The dimensioning of the process equipment will be performed through entering process equipment data
such as electrical or thermal energy requirement, height, width, length, weight and CAPEX of the process
equipment, see Table ET E.1, Figure 6.11. By entering this data, estimation equations can be determined
through plotting the data in excel “XY Scatter” charts and plotting trendlines of the data sets. The equations
are calculated by excel and the R2 value shows how accurate the trendline is. For instance, a R2 value of
0.9978 (see Figure 6.12) is considered accurate as a R2 value approaching 1, approaches 100 % agreement
line-fitting.

Boiler thermal output (kW)

Figure 6.12: Boiler steam generation
In the ET, boiler and burner sizes are determined through the “boiler thermal output”, which is calculated
through the thermal stripping duty. For instance, the conventional MEA CC process requires 3.6 GJ/ton CO2,
now imagine capturing 20 tons CO2/h, which leads to 72 GJ/h of boiler thermal output. Conversion from GJ/h
to GJ/s equals 0.02 GJ/s, which equals 20 MW of boiler thermal output. Utilizing the equation in Figure 6.12
provides the steam generation in tons steam/h through substituting (x) in the equation with the calculated
boiler thermal output. The result is 30.92 tons steam/h, for 20 tons of CO2 captured per hour. The burner
dimensioning requires the amount of steam generation to be calculated. In this equipment dimensioning
case, boiler and burner dimensioning can only be performed through steam generation as a common
denominator.
Mass flow will determine the dimensioning of most process equipment. The sections ET E.2-E.25 (check
Appendix C.1) contain all process equipment and every section contains a table with different sizes of the
specific process equipment. For instance, section E.2 contains pump information, see Figure 6.13, includes a
table (Table ET E.2.1) with all pump models, in this case four different sizes from Alibaba.com. This
information is utilized in ET E.2.2-E.2.4, from these tables, graphs are created in ET E.2.5, where equations
are calculated for approximating process equipment dimensioning. These equations are automatically copied
from ET E.2.6 and placed in ET E.1, however, note that the equations in graphs ET E.2.5 must be copied
manually to ET E.2.6 by hand!
The process equipment considered:
❖ Pumps, exhaust blowers, absorber columns, water wash columns, stripper columns, condensers,
heat exchangers, LVCs, thermal reclaimers, amine tanks, boilers, burners, WHR, screw chillers, CO2
compressors, CO2 storage tanks, CO2 refrigeration equipment, CO2 recycle, saturation reactors,
crystallizers, filters, pre-heaters, CO2 stripping thermal reactors and separation columns.

Figure 6.13: E.2 section containing information about pumps. Table E.2.1 contains the pump models, Tables E.2.2, E.2.3 and E.2.4
are the data points sources for the graphs in E.2.5. The equations in E.2.6 are taken from E.2.5 and transported to Table E.1.

The purpose (as mentioned before) of the “E. Equipment” worksheet is to determine equations for
approximating all process equipment. These equations are automatically copied from ET E.1 to the process
equipment Tables ET H.4, I.4, J.4, K.4 and L.4, where process equipment is gathered for all CC processes and
the total power consumption, footprint and costs are summed together. This information is utilized in “M.
Outputs” later.

F. CO2 transportation
The CO2 transportation worksheet contains five theoretical calculations for CO2 in supercritical, liquid and
solid phases, see Table 6.2. These phases are explained in Chapter 3 in this thesis.

Tables ET F.1 and F.2, see Figure 6.14, shows the utilized pressure and temperature conditions. Table ET F.3
is created for calculating the estimated compressor power consumption [66] when dealing with impurities.
This estimation is utilized for compressor power estimation when the CO2 purity is 60 wt-% and the rest is
ammonia and water content. Article [66] investigated CO2 purity between 90-98 wt-%. It is assumed that the
data line trend continues below 90 wt-% linearly, in order to be able to estimate the pressurization of CO2
and ammonia mixtures, required in case of the ammonia CC process. Table ET F.4 shows a phase diagram of
CO2. The results of the five theoretical transportation phases, see Table 6.2 for temperature and pressure
conditions, are presented in section F.5, see Figure 6.14.

Figure 6.14: Tables F.1 and F.2 show the CO2 phases, Table F.3 shows compression power estimation for impure CO2 streams, section
F.4 shows the CO2 phase diagram and F.5 shows the results for compression and cooling power demand for the five theoretical
transportation cases.

In sections ET F.6-F.10, see Figure 6.15 (ET F.9), the five theoretical case calculations are performed. In the
first table in these sections, the compression power demand is calculated (see ET F.9.1) and in the second
table, the cooling demand is calculated (see ET F.9.2). Beneath these tables, the graphs show the compression
stages and intercooling stages, see Figure 6.15 (ET F.9.3 and F.9.4). In these graphs, the compression stage is
colored orange and the cooling stages are colored blue. For calculations information, see section “CO 2
transportation” in Chapter “MEA, Cansolv and Ammonia (H., I., J., K., L.)”.

G. Absorption
This section contains the general process descriptions of the three absorption CC processes that are
considered in this thesis. The process descriptions can be seen in Appendix D.1 and D.2.
The MEA (ET H. and I.) and Cansolv (ET J. and K.) CC processes will be divided into a “conventional” and a
“LVC case”. The conventional CC process will require more thermal energy but less electrical power. The LVC
case will require less thermal energy but more electrical power. The ammonia (ET L.) CC process will be
“conventional” only.

MEA, Cansolv and Ammonia (H., I., J., K., L.)
These sections contain process information such as mass flows, temperatures and pressures of the CC
processes. Every worksheet of the MEA, Cansolv and ammonia processes are structured in the same way.
From top of the page downwards, all sections contain a process description (1.), mass flow table (2.),
temperatures and pressure table (3.), process equipment table (4.), reboiler duty table (5.), CO2
transportation table (6.), solvent and reclaiming of solvent tables (7.), cooling duty tables (8.), heat exchanger
tables (9.), absorber column design tables (10.) and stripper column design tables (11.).

67

1. Process description
Every CC process worksheet contain as mentioned above, a section with tables describing process conditions
in the CC system, see ET H.1, I.1, J.1, K.1 and L.1 and Figure 6.16. These are mass flows, temperatures and
pressures in different process equipment sections. This process description provides the user with a general
understanding of what happens in the system, once after the exhaust gas enters all the way to compressing
and storing CO2.
Additionally, there are arrows included that show process flow directions and a description section of the
arrow color and table color and what the colors mean. For instance, black arrows are exhaust gas flows and
black tables are “main equipment”, allowing the user to follow a certain type of mass flow from entrance to
exiting the system. A process description from literature sources is also included as pictures, these show the
flow directions without process conditions values and are thus less cluttered with values.

Figure 6.16: Process description ET H.1 section (MEA process), green box is the detailed process description and orange boxes are the
picture process descriptions and symbols and are descriptions for understanding the green box symbols.

2. Mass flow
Mass flows for nitrogen, oxygen, contaminants (NOx, SOx), CO2 and water are taken from Table ET B.3.3 and
from ET B.4.6. The solvent mass flow entering the CC system is calculated in Tables ET H.8.1, I.8.1, J.8.1, K.8.1
and L.8.1, see “Solvent information and reclaiming” section for more information.
It is assumed that nitrogen, oxygen and contaminants mass flows are exiting the process in treated exhaust
gas and do not react with the solvent, see Figure 6.17 “orange” box. The effect of contaminants is considered

68

as solvent degradation and calculated in solvent mass flows. There by, all Tables (ET H.2, I.2, J.2, K.2 and L.2)
do not track nitrogen, oxygen and contaminants mass flows after the “water wash” table rows.

MEA and MEA+LVC: Important mass flows to follow are CO2, water and solvent, see Figure 6.17 “blue” box.
The CO2 mass flow entering with the exhaust gas is absorbed by the solvent. The lean solvent entering contain
some CO2, see “Solvent information and reclaiming” section. This lean solvent absorbs the CO2 from the
exhaust gas entering and exits the column as a rich solvent, with high CO2 content. The CO2 mass flow can be
followed if section “Solvent information and reclaiming” is read.

Figure 6.17: The mass flow table of the MEA process, highlighting the difference between important mass flows (blue box) and mass
flows assumed away for simplification reasons (orange box).

The water in the exhaust gas is assumed to leave the absorption column with the exhaust gas and thereby it
is assumed that the process is in water balance. However, it is reported in [67] that the water consumption
is negative for power plants, meaning captured condensate water in the exhaust gas cooling tower will supply
the CC process with make-up water for the water wash column. Cooling processes will in this case utilize
once-through cooling, sea water is used for cooling processes and water is captured for maintaining neutral
water balance in the absorption column. For the simplification of mass flows, water in the exhaust gas is
assumed to leave with the exhaust gas, in reality this water might be used as water make-up for water
escaping the process.
This mass flow is difficult to track as there is water in the solvent and in the water wash column. Cooling
water is utilized for cooling the exhaust gas to the absorber´s operational temperature, calculated in ET H.8.1
69

and I.8.1. The amount of wash water for the water wash column is about double the exhaust gas mass flow,
calculated in ET H.8.2 and I.8.2 from [68], which is the water wash flow for the Cansolv process. It is thus
assumed that the MEA process consumes the same amount of water as the Cansolv process. Sources for the
MEA process water wash flow could not be found. Condense water from the CO2 product condenser is
estimated from TCM Mongstad installation, see section ET H.12 and I.12. [10] The amount of steam is
calculated in Table ET H.5 and I.5.
The solvent mass flow enters the absorber as lean solvent and exits as rich solvent. It is assumed that no
solvent exits the absorber with the exhaust gas for simplification reasons. The solvent is additionally assumed
to not exit the stripper with the CO2 product. After the LVC, 4 % of the solvent will enter the thermal reclaimer
as a “slip-stream”, calculated in ET H.7.2 and I.7.2 from [14]. The thermal reclaimer removes degraded solvent
from the process, new solvent enters in the “Solvent make-up” section of ET H.2 and I.2. The solvent
degradation amount is calculated with the values 1.3 and 3.2 kg waste amine/ton CO2 captured, respectively.
[14]

Cansolv DC-103 and Cansolv DC-103+MVR: The Cansolv process mass flow will be similar to the MEA process,
the important mass flows to follow are CO2, water and solvent as before. The CO2 capture efficiency of 8090 % is generally found in literature, for instance [11], [10], [69] and [9]. A capture percentage of 5-90 % is
utilized as the CO2 removal percentage in the absorption columns for the MEA, Cansolv and Ammonia mass
flow calculations in ET H.7.1, I.7.1, J.7.1, K.7.1 and L.7.1, see “Solvent information and reclaiming” section.
The CO2 removal efficiency is directly related to thermal stripping duty as more captured CO2 leads to more
steam requirement, and values entered in the ET are for 5-90 % CO2 removal efficiency.
The water entering with the exhaust gas is assumed to leave the process with the treated exhaust gas. For
simplification reasons as before, solvent and water wash water are assumed to be constant and do not leave
the process. The water wash amount is double the exhaust gas amount, calculated in J.8.2 and K.8.2 from
[68]. Condense water from the CO2 product stream is estimated as before from the MEA process [10]. Steam
is calculated in ET J.5 and K.5, with the value being 1.05 kg steam/kg CO2 captured. [11]
Solvent amount is calculated in ET J.7.1 K.7.1, see “Solvent information and reclaiming” section. The thermal
reclaiming unit utilized in the Cansolv process purifies up to 99.75 % of the solvent entering the reclaiming
process. [11] The same slip stream amount of 4 % is assumed for the Cansolv process. [14] The Cansolv
process solvent degradation information cannot be found, the degradation is thus estimated from the MEA
slip stream amount of 4 % and utilizing the thermal reclaimer´s 99.75 % purification number, an estimation
can be reached. The result is about 0.85 kg waste DC-103/ton CO2, see ET J.7.2 and K.7.2. Comparing this
value to the MEA degradation rate of 1.3 to 3.2 kg degraded amine/ton CO2 it seems relatively accurate as
70

article [70] hints at Cansolv DC-201 having a “very low” degradation rate, and knowing that DC-103 utilized
in this Cansolv process is an earlier version of DC-201, it can be assumed that the value is relatively accurate
(possibly too high). The slip stream solvent and make-up solvent are added to the lean solvent that did not
enter the thermal reclaiming unit and the lean solvent is reintroduced into the absorber for another cycle of
CO2 absorption.

Aqueous ammonia: The aqueous ammonia process will be different from the MEA and Cansolv processes as
there are two absorbers and a filter section where a portion of the rich solvent returns to absorb slipped
ammonia in water wash-1 for exhaust gas treatment. The stripper column is replaced by a low temperature
thermal reactor section. Nitrogen, oxygen and contaminants leave the process with exhaust gas.
The CO2 mass flow absorbed over both absorbers is 90 % capture efficiency, the same as in the MEA and
Cansolv processes. The captured CO2 in absorber-1 is 65 % and in absorber-2 the remaining 35 % is captured,
leading to a CO2 removal percentage of 90 %. In the saturation reactor, CO2 from the CO2 recycle (red color
in ET L.2 CO2 column, see Figure 6.18) is added together with rich solvent CO2. The CO2 recycle flow is
calculated to be 110 % multiplied by the ton CO2/h captured for the process, source from [17]. At the filter
section, 30 % of the rich solvent (blue color in ET L.2 CO2 column, see Figure 6.18) mass flow is pumped to
wash-1 for absorbing the slipped ammonia from the treated exhaust gas. The rest, 70 % of the CO2 is present
in the solvent slurry. The CO2 is stripped from the solvent in the thermal reactor. In the separation column,
some CO2 will be left in the lean solvent (light blue color in ET L.2 CO2 column, see Figure 6.18) and the rest
of it is CO2 product. In wash-1 for CO2, the product CO2 (green color in ET L.2 CO2 column, see Figure 6.18)
and some rich solvent CO2 exits for wash-2 CO2. After the CO2 product is washed, it is transported to the CO2
compression stage and for the CO2 recycle.
The exhaust gas water mass flow is assumed to exit the process with the treated exhaust gas for
simplification. The wash water for wash-2 for exhaust gas is calculated from [71], with a water to exhaust gas
ratio of 1:1. The wash-2 for CO2 wash water is calculated from [71], where the water to CO2 product ratio is
0.4:1, in other words water amount is 40 % that of the CO2 mass flow.
Solvent amount is calculated in ET L.7.1, see section “Solvent information and reclaiming” for calculations.
The lean solvent enters absorber-1 and is loaded with CO2. The exhaust gas exiting absorber-2 will contain
about 1 wt-% of ammonia [17]. The ammonia content of the exhaust gas (yellow color in ET L.2 solvent
column, see Figure 6.18), is reduced to 0.1-0.3 % after the first washing column (wash-1 for exhaust gas) [17].
The ammonia content is further reduced to 100-200 ppm or 0.01-0.02 wt-% in wash-2 for exhaust gas.
Depending on the water wash temperature, the ammonia slip can be reduced more efficiently with colder
water, for instance 8 °C water reduces the slip to 200 ppm with a water to exhaust gas ratio of 1:1. Instead,
71

if washing water is available at 2 °C, the slip can be reduced to 100 ppm at the same washing water flow. [17]
In the ET, water is cooled by screw chillers to approximately 5 °C, as the equipment found is limited to this
temperature, see “Cooling duty” below for more information. This leads to an ammonia slip of about 150
ppm.

Figure 6.18: The aqueous ammonia mass flow table, the CO2 and aqueous ammonia mass flows are tracked with “colors” as these
mass flows are difficult to track.

The rich solvent exiting absorber-2 (white color in ET L.2 solvent column, see Figure 6.18) is pumped to the
saturation reactor where the CO2 content is increased. In the crystallizer the rich solvent is cooled down
further to obtain a slurry rich in ammonium bicarbonate, which is a solid form of the rich solvent, additionally
there will be liquid solvent present. The liquid and solid solvents are separated in the filter section of the
process, where 30 % of the solvent is liquid and 70 % of the solvent is in solid state [17].
The liquid solvent is utilized in wash-1 for exhaust gas for absorbing slipped ammonia. Later, it is pumped to
wash-1 for CO2 where it absorbs slipped ammonia from the CO2 product. This now lean solvent is further
utilized for heat exchange with the solid slurry before it enters the thermal reactor (purple color in ET L.2

72

solvent column, see Figure 6.18). Afterwards it is pumped to the ammonia make-up section where all lean
solvents accumulate.
The solid rich solvent proceeds from the filter (dark blue color in ET L.2 solvent column, see Figure 6.18) as a
constant mass flow until the separation column, where CO2 product already desorbed, leaves the solvent.
The solvent, now a liquid is utilized in a heat exchanger for providing some heat to the stripping process. This
solvent mass flow is pumped to the ammonia make-up section, where all lean solvent flows accumulate.
The solvent amount that is not absorbed by the rich solvent from wash-1 exhaust gas, proceeds with the CO2
product (green color in ET L.2 solvent column, see Figure 6.18) and it is removed from the CO2 product by
wash water. A small amount (orange color) of solvent remain in the CO2 product but it is minimal as the CO2
purity reaches 99.5 wt-%.

3. Temperature and pressure
The temperature and pressure tables are utilized for process temperature calculations. For instance, the
wash water temperatures and sea water temperatures are important for the cooling duty sections, as the
temperature difference is utilized for calculating heating and cooling demands. Process temperatures and
pressures can be found in ET H.3, I.3, J.3, K.3 and L.3 Tables. All temperatures and pressures could not be
found from literature, some temperatures are thus, assumed in the ET.

MEA and MEA+LVC: The MEA process temperatures and pressures are taken from [10]. This information can
be found in the ET H.12 and I.12 Tables. Test campaign data are for 16 different cases that were run at
Technology Center Mongstad (TCM), providing a real case example for the process conditions for a MEA CC
process plant. The temperature and pressure Table H.3, see Figure 6.19, shows the temperatures to the left
and the pressures to the right, with reference columns showing if there are sources or if it is an assumed
value.
Cansolv DC-103 and Cansolv DC-103+MVR: The Cansolv DC-103 process temperatures are taken from [68].
The remaining temperatures and pressures are from [10], the MEA process conditions source from TCM. The
assumption is that the MEA and Cansolv processes are very similar, which can be concluded by comparing
[68] and [10].
Aqueous ammonia: The temperatures and pressures of the aqueous ammonia process are from [17].

4. Process equipment
The process equipment is sized in ET H.4, I.4, J.4, K.4 and L.4 Tables, see Figure 6.20 (H.4). The equipment
mass flows, temperatures and pressures are gathered in the left side of the table. The total process electrical
power consumption, fuel consumption, space, volume, weight and cost of all process equipment are
gathered in the bottom of the table. The sizing of process equipment is calculated in the right side of the
table, the equations are gathered from ET E.1 Table. When applying these calculations, the size, cost or power
consumption by the process equipment is obtained.

indicate that information is still missing.

5. Reboiler duty
The reboiler thermal energy is calculated from the thermal stripping duty, for instance, the MEA process
thermal stripping duty is 3.6 GJ thermal/ton CO2, see Figure 6.21 (ET H.5 Table). Multiplying the thermal
stripping duty with tons of captured CO2 and converting time from hours to seconds provides the thermal
energy in megawatts, see eq.6.5.

The steam consumption is calculated from a kg steam/kg CO2 captured value. The steam consumption is
utilized for the design of the stripper column in H.11, I.11, J.11, K.11 and L.11. The WHR available value is
utilized for calculating the reboiler thermal energy requirement, for instance a high WHR value will reduce

75

the reboiler thermal energy requirement greatly and thus reduce the size of the reboiler and the extra fuel
consumption additionally. This is considered in ET B.4 reboiler sizing calculations.

Figure 6.21: Reboiler thermal energy calculations, steam requirement and WHR available.

6. CO2 transportation
The compression duty is calculated by eq. 6.6. The compressor efficiency is assumed to be 75 %. In the i-th
compression stage the enthalpy out (discharge) is subtracted by enthalpy in (suction) and is multiplied by
mass flow of CO2 captured and cooling efficiency. Appendix E.1 and E.2 shows the compression (orange lines)
and cooling (blue lines) stages. The MEA and Cansolv compression stage starts at 2 bar pressure and 30 °C
and ammonia at 8 bar and 30 °C. The ammonia process compression power will be higher as ammonia and
CO2 are compressed to 8 bars from 1 bar before wash-1 for CO2, with more than double the mass flow for
compression and as a result higher compression power requirement.

The compression and cooling

calculations are available in Appendix E.3 with an example of compression and cooling for the supercritical
CO2 phase liquefaction.

The cooling power required is calculated by eq.6.7 and 6.8. The mass flow of captured CO2 is multiplied by
the enthalpy change from the enthalpy out (discharge) from the i-1-th compression stage subtracted by the
enthalpy in (suction) at the i-th stage. Total cooling duty is calculated by eq.6.7 and the power demand of
refrigeration equipment is calculated by eq.6.8. Table 6.3 shows the assumed energy efficiency ratio (EER),
as the temperature decreases the EER decreases. The EER equals the total cooling duty required for cooling
over power input by cooling equipment. For instance, cooling CO2 to -80 °C will require much more power
from the cooling equipment than what is obtained in total cooling duty, hence the EER is below the value
one.

7. Solvent information and reclaiming
The solvent loading in mol CO2/mol solvent is provided in literature, for instance the MEA process rich and
lean loadings are 0.483 and 0.215 mol CO2/mol solvent. The difference in CO2 loading between the rich and
lean solvent and the amount of captured CO2 per hour provides the solvent flow per hour, eq.6.10. The CO2
loading is converted from mol CO2/mol solvent to kg CO2/kg solvent, see eq.6.9, as the mass flows in the ET
are in tons/h. The solvent CO2 loading in tons/h is calculated in eq.6.11. The molar masses utilized are 61.08
g/mol for MEA (assumed same for Cansolv DC-103), 17.031 g/mol for ammonia and 44.009 g/mol for CO2.

77

The solvent degradation in kg solvent/h is calculated in eq.6.12. This degradation rate is utilized for
calculating the OPEX. The amount of solvent required in the system is calculated by multiplying the solvent
flow and retention time in the system, see eq.6.13.

8. Cooling duty
The cooling duty is calculated in eq.6.14. The mass flow, the specific heat capacity and the temperature in
and out are required. The required cooling duty can be supplied by chillers or heat exchangers. Utilizing heat
exchangers would reduce the electrical power consumption and is thus utilized in all cooling processes above
78

20 °C. In the ammonia process, cooling duties required are below 20 °C, and in these cases screw chillers are
utilized. The heat exchangers utilize sea water for cooling duties. The amount of sea water in tons/h is
calculated in eq.6.15.

Figure 6.24: The cooling duty calculations tables H.8.1-H.8.6, cooling duty (orange boxes), sea water required (blue boxes) and water
wash amount (red box).

9. Heat exchanger
Heat exchangers are used for heating the cold rich solvent with the hot lean solvent exiting the stripper
column. Further, heat exchangers are utilized for cooling duties, especially if the cooling duty is above 20 °C
as sea water can be the cooling agent. The equations utilized can be seen below, eq.6.16-6.20. [75]
The area for the heat exchanger is calculated to design the required size of a heat exchanger, see eq.6.16.
The cooling or heating duty is calculated in “8. Cooling duty” and utilized in heat exchanger calculations. The
heat transfer coefficient (U) is calculated in eq.6.17. The values h1 and h2 are heat transfer coefficients for
the fluids (assumed to be 500 W/(m2*K)), 𝜆 is the thermal conductivity of stainless steel (assumed to be 20
79

W/(m*K)) and 𝛥𝑋 is the wall thickness in meters (assumed to be 0.005m). The log mean temperature is
calculated with the ΔT1 and ΔT2 values, see eq.6.18-6.20. [76] The heat exchangers are assumed to be ideal
and of single-pass counterflow, no F factor is considered. This approach eliminates the need for applying a
certain shell and tube design to the heat exchanger, thus simplifying the calculations. [77]

The area calculation for heat exchangers (HE) are performed in H.9, I.9, J.9, K.9 and L.9, see Figure 6.25. Heat
exchangers are utilized for cooling processes for rich/lean solvent, water wash, lean solvent, intercooler, CO2
product cooler and top stripper coolers. Pumps are included for pumping the sea water required for the
cooling processes. Solvent and process water that is cooled by heat exchangers are cooled by cold sea water,
pumped from the ocean. The seawater temperature can be changed in H.3, I.3, J.3, K.3 and L.3, colder sea
80

water will lead to reduced pumping power demand. Heat exchangers are not used in the ammonia process
as the cooling temperatures are below 20 °C.

10. Absorber and stripper column design
The diameter and height of the absorber column is calculated by determining the number of transfer units
(NTU) and height of transfer units (HTU), see eq.6.21. The calculations are available in Appendix F.2 for the
absorber column. For the stripper column, the diameter and height are calculated in the same way as for the
absorber column, differences can be seen in Appendix F.3.
The packing material in the absorber and stripper columns will be plastic Pall rings, see Appendix F.1. Plastic
is chosen as it will decrease the total weight of the columns compared to metal or ceramic packing materials.
The equilibrium constant (K) is calculated in Appendix F.4. The calculation is based on Raoult´s law, where
the partial pressure of CO2 in the solvent is divided by the system pressure. It is assumed that the system
behaves ideally. [78]
The removal percentage and the exhaust gas amount can be changed to impact the column design. If the
removal percentage is lowered, the column height is reduced. If the exhaust gas mass flow into the column
is reduced, the column diameter will be smaller. On “A. Dashboard” it is possible to change these values,
preset at 90 % removal percentage and 100 % exhaust gas flow entering the column.
Another design consideration is the packing material, for instance, a packing material with a higher mass
transfer surface area will reduce column height and a packing material with a higher void fraction will
increase exhaust gas velocity inside the column and therefore, diameter is reduced but at the expense of a
higher column. The current packing material utilized as a high void fraction value, leading to less column
diameter but a higher column height overall. Packing material can be chosen according to the specific vessel
installation and how much height and diameter can be fitted onboard.
Height of column:
•

Z = NTU * HTU

(eq.6.21) [79]

The absorber column is sized in ET H.10, I.10, J.10, K.10 and L.10. The diameter and height of the column is
calculated in the left side table and the mol fractions of CO2 in the exhaust gas and in the solvent are
calculated in the table on the right side, see Figure 6.26. The densities and viscosities of liquids and gases at
different temperatures are available in the ET at different locations in the tables.

81

The stripper column is sized in ET H.11, I.11, J.11, K.11 and L.11. The diameter and height of the column is
calculated in the left side table and the mol fractions of CO2 in the steam and in the solvent are calculated in
the table on the right side, see Figure 6.26. The densities and viscosities of liquids and gases at different
temperatures are available in the ET at different locations in the tables.

M. Outputs
In this section the economic analysis, captured and emitted CO2, power demand and footprint of the CC
system is gathered, see Figure 6.27. The economic analysis is based on the equations in Chapter 4. Results
are for instance, TAC, VOPEX, FOPEX and CCCO2, see ET M.1. There is also an “economic values” table with
assumed transportation costs, storage costs and selling prices, these values can be entered by the user on
the homepage in “A. Dashboard”. The total captured CO2 during one voyage and the total emissions of CO2
are available in ET M.2 Table. The power demand is available in ET M.3 Table and the footprint of the CC
system in ET M.4 Table.

7. Case study- Aurora Botnia
A case study of Aurora Botnia is done to evaluate what kind of information can be obtained from entering
vessel-specific information into the ET. Firstly, input data must be determined from the installation and
operational profile information about the vessel. Afterwards, the results can be obtained and evaluated.
Some restrictions will lead to uncertainties regarding size of CC system and total equipment cost, see sections
below.

Inputs
The inputs that are required are operational profile in hours, CO2 storage in hours, capture percentage,
number of engines, engine configuration, maximum mass flow of exhaust gas from the engines, fuel type for
reboiler, number of installed scrubber units (NOx, SOx) and number of WHR units installed.

Information required
Operational profile: The operational profile is entered for 100 %, 85 %, 75 % and 50 % engine loads, see Table
7.5. The operational profiles for Aurora Botnia are divided into high and low season, see Appendix G.1 and
G.2. The engine load during low season reaches a maximum power demand of approximately 6.2 MW, with
two engines running. During high season the maximum engine load reaches 13.5 MW, with four engines
running. The difference arrives from higher vessel speed during high season and possibly more electricity
demand onboard the vessel with more passengers onboard.
The low season power demand is 6.2 MW (engines only, see Appendix G.1), the CC system power demand is
at 75 % engine load 0.55-1.31 MW, see Table 7.3. The electricity demand for the CC system is then 6.75-7.51
MW. The engine power output at 75 % engine load is 6.6 MW, engine load needs to be increased.
Increasing the engine load to 85 %, engine output at 7.5 MW, leads to a larger CC system power demand of
0.61-1.45 MW, see Table 7.2, leading to a total power demand of 6.81-7.65 MW (engines+ CC system). The
engines are there by run on 85 % engine load. All capture technologies except the ammonia process can be
utilized (at 85 % engine load), unless the engine load is increased to around 90 % for the ammonia process.
The ET does not, however, allow for data entry at 90 % engine load, future development will have to resolve
this issue.

The high season power demand is 13.5 MW (engines only, see Appendix G.2), the CC system power demand
is at 75 % engine load 0.94-2.15 MW, see Table 7.3. The electricity demand for the CC system is then 14.4415.65 MW. The engine power output at 75 % engine load is 13.2 MW, engine load needs to be increased.
Increasing the engine load to 85 %, engine output at 15.0 MW, leads to a larger CC system power demand of
1.05-2.38 MW, see Table 7.4, leading to a total power demand of 14.55-15.88 MW (engines+ CC system). All
capture technologies except the ammonia process can be utilized (at 85 % engine load), unless the engine
load is increased to around 90 % for the ammonia process.

CO2 storage: The CO2 storage amount is determined after entering the storage time required. In this case, it
is assumed that the discharge of CO2 can be done in Vaasa and not in Umeå. This leads to a total storage time
for routes Vaasa-Umeå and Umeå-Vaasa of 7 hours (high season) and 8 hours (low season), see Table 7.5.
Capture percentage: The capture percentage can be chosen between 5-90 %. In this case study, 90 % capture
rate is chosen, see Table 7.5. Exhaust gas mass flow is chosen at 100 %, all exhaust gas enters the CC system.
Engines: The engine information that is required are number of engines, engine configuration, fuel type,
speed mode, type and IMO Tier type, see Table 7.5.
Maximum mass flow design for the CC system: The maximum mass flow option determines the highest
amount of exhaust gas that may enter the CC system. For instance, in this case the highest engine load is 85
%, meaning the exhaust gas mass flow will be chosen for 85 % mass flow of exhaust gas, see Table 7.5.

Reboiler fuel type: The reboiler fuel type is either HFO or LNG. In this case, LNG is chosen, see Table 7.5.
Scrubbers and WHR installed: Scrubbers (NOx and SOx) units’ information is required for determining exhaust
gas cooling demand. When exhaust gas exits scrubbers, the temperature is about 40 °C, leading to reduced
cooling demands for the CC system. The WHR unit information is required for determining how much waste
heat can be utilized for steam generation, possibly reducing the reboiler size and fuel consumption.
In the base case, no scrubbers are installed, and two engines have WHR units installed. This leads to all
exhaust gas leaving the engines and reboiler require cooling (low and high season). With two WHR units
installed, the high season scenario can utilize exhaust gas from two engines, thus reducing the reboiler steam
generation requirement. The low season scenario requires steam generation from the reboiler only, as no
waste heat from the exhaust gas can be utilized with two WHR units already installed out of two engines.

Restrictions
Information that is unavailable is listed below, as “Space and volume unavailable” and “Cost and weight
unavailable”. The electrical and thermal energy (heat) consumption are fully accounted for. Fuel
consumption is additionally fully accounted for, possible to obtain results.
The missing information is related to space, volume, weight and cost. Assuming the costs enables an
economic analysis to be performed (with high uncertainties). The area footprint of the CC system will be left
for future development, but a general understanding can be obtained at present by utilizing projections for
equipment that needs to be added (with high uncertainties).

Results
The results that can be obtained from the ET are CO2 emissions, power demand of the CC system and, with
a significant error margin, the cost. The footprint of the CC system is not reliable, as much equipment is still
not included into the ET, but it is estimated anyway. The large process equipment such as absorber and
stripper columns are calculated theoretically, and a conclusion can thereafter be made on how much height
the columns will require onboard the vessel.

Emissions
The emissions will be the largest in the MEA process, as the stripping duty is the largest, see Table 7.7. The
increase in emissions for the high season is between 2.8-16.7 % and for the low season scenario the increase
is between 22.0-38.1 %, above the case where no CC is utilized. Most emissions arrive from the MEA process
and the least from the Cansolv+LVC process. In the high season scenario, the increase in emissions is less
than for the low season scenario as WHR heat is available. This can also be seen by comparing Appendix G.3

90

with Table 7.7. It should be noted, increase in emissions is for reboiler only as emissions increase from 75 %
to 85 % engine load cannot be calculated in the current ET, future development might resolve the issue.

Power and heat demand
The energy demand is divided into power (electricity) and thermal energy (heat). Thermal energy is supplied
by the reboiler and electrical power is supplied by the engines through increasing the engine load. The
electrical power is there by supplied by increased fuel consumption, extra fuel consumption by the engines
are included in the variable OPEX among the reboiler fuel consumption (VOPEX costs).
The energy penalty is based on the extra electricity demand by the CC system, see Table 7.8. Electricity
demand of the CC system is divided by the engine power utilized for propulsion of the vessel and electricity
consumption for other purposes onboard the ship than CC. The energy penalty for both the high and low
season scenarios is around 7-11 % for all processes except for the ammonia process, which has a significantly
higher energy penalty of around 15-19 %, see Table 7.8. The energy penalty for the high season scenario is
approximately 2-3 % lower than the case for the low season scenarios. The ammonia process requires more
91

electrical power because of low operating temperatures. Seawater for cooling duties can therefore not be
utilized as cooling, and screw chillers are utilized instead, with the drawback of higher electrical power
demand.

The fuel consumption for the high season scenario increases by 13-26 % for supplying electrical and thermal
energy to the CC system, see Table 7.9. If no WHR is utilized as in the case for the low season scenario, the
fuel consumption increases by 31-46 %. Lowest fuel consumption arise from the processes with LVCs
incorporated. The difference between low and high seasons arrives from WHR utilization or not. In the high
season scenario, WHR is available from two out of four engines and in the low season scenario no WHR is
available.
Regarding the choice of incorporating LVCs, the electric power demand increases with the benefit being
lower fuel consumption, see Tables 7.8 and 7.9. Without LVCs, the fuel consumption increases but the electric
power demand decreases. The total CO2 emissions and fuel consumption can be reduced with the
incorporation of LVCs at higher electricity demands. In other words, CC system size could be reduced with
LVCs as less emissions are produced and consequently, less exhaust gas mass flow enters the system. The
LVC will however occupy some space onboard and additionally, it will increase the extra fuel consumption of
the engines, leading to possibly more emissions. This can however not be evaluated here as the engine load
92

is chosen to be 85 % for all engines and thus, the difference in extra exhaust gas produced by the engines are
the same for all processes, diminishing the impact of LVC incorporation or not. Future development of the
ET might resolve this issue.

Economic results
The economic results that are important are total CCCO2, TAC, ACAPEX, FOPEX and VOPEX. The economic
results are available in Table 7.10 and 7.11, where CCCO2 is calculated (only capture). Later, the total CCCO2
is calculated with low, medium and high estimates for transportation and storage of CO2. The equipment cost
assumptions from Table 7.6 are utilized for all CC processes in Tables 7.10 and 7.11. The equipment costs are
divided into three cases with different fuel prices.
The fuel price for LNG is 74 $/ton LNG (low scenario) [80], HFO/LFO is 230 $/ton fuel oil (medium scenario)
[80] and 500 $/ton fuel (high scenario) is chosen for understanding the fuel price impact on CCCO2. The fuel
price of 74 $/ton CO2 is the best-case scenario for LNG, reached in May of 2020 [80], the price may fluctuate
up to 250 $/ton CO2. These are the ranges for LNG, but the liquefaction and distribution costs may vary the
price from region to region quite a lot. The ET allows for entering the fuel price by the user, the price
fluctuation of 74 to 500 $/ton CO2 is here utilized for showing the fuel price impact on CCCO2.

The CCCO2 ($/ton CO2) in Table 7.10 (high season values) shows a large variability in CCCO2. This variability is
the smallest when the fuel price is constant and the equipment cost is altered (low, medium and high
equipment cost scenarios). This means that the equipment cost assumptions in Table 7.6 are important but
not as important as the fuel price, see Figures 7.1 and 7.2. The case where the fuel price is 200 $/ton fuel the
increase in CCCO2 is relatively large. Reason being the dominant position of the VOPEX, which is heavily
dependent on the fuel price. In the high scenario of a fuel price of 500 $/ton fuel, the CCCO 2 is very high
compared to the fuel oil and LNG price situations. The high fuel price scenario serves as a reference to where
the CCCO2 will end up, if the fuel price increases beyond 200 $/ton fuel. CC will thereby be more economical
when the fuel price is low.
The low season CCCO2 increases as the ACAPEX and FOPEX are high, due to only two engines out of four are
running, see Table 7.11. Because two engines are not running, the ACAPEX is proportionally higher than the
high season value as two engines are maintained and the annual capital expenditure (ACAPEX) is still the
same as for the high season scenario, compare ACAPEX and FOPEX of Appendices G.5 and G.6. The annual
operating time decreases additionally leading to less emissions and subsequently the CCCO2 increases, see
Chapter 4 equations. The annual emissions are visible in Appendices G.5 and G.6, the value for the high
season is around 26 000-30 000 tons CO2/year and for the low season around 8500 tons CO2/year.

94

The CCCO2 for the high season scenario is around 9.4-24.9 $/ton CO2 with LNG as fuel and 74 $/ton fuel, see
Table 7.10, and for the low season scenario around 26.1-71.7 $/ton CO2, see Table 7.11. For the HFO/LFO
scenario (also relevant for the Aurora Botnia case study), the CCCO2 for the high season is around 16.3-37.0
$/ton CO2 and for the low season scenario around 42.1-89.1 $/ton CO2. The CCCO2 for the highest fuel price
scenario for the high season scenario is around 32.7-65.9 $/ton CO2 and for the low season scenario around
79.0-130.8 $/ton CO2.

It can be concluded that for Aurora Botnia, the CCCO2 will be in the region of 20-80 $/ton CO2 (capture only),
depending on the season. The later transportation and storage costs need to be accounted for additionally.
The total CCCO2 adds the transportation and storage costs to the previously calculated CCCO2 (capture only).
Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show the total CCCO2 with transportation and storage ranges. These ranges are divided
similarly to the cases before, low, medium and high transportation and storage costs are determined.
Transportation is divided into 4.7 $/ton CO2 (165km offshore pipeline), 16.5 $/ton CO2 (1000km ship, 20
Mtpa) and 26 $/ton CO2 (1000km ship, 1 Mtpa). Storage is divided into 0.5 $/ton CO2 (saline formation
offshore), 15 $/ton CO2 (saline formation offshore) and 30 $/ton CO2 (saline formation offshore). As
transportation volumes are low, the higher limit of transportation should be followed and the storage cost,
medium-high range.

Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show the total CCCO2 for the MEA process for the high and low season scenarios, the
cases for other processes than the MEA process will be slightly lower but are not included. For Aurora Botnia,
the total CCCO2 for a fuel price of 74 $/ton fuel will be in the regions of 20-81 $/ton CO2 (high season) and
35-119 $/ton CO2 (low season). For HFO/LFO vessels (also Aurora Botnia), the cost will be in the regions of
32-93 $/ton CO2 (high season) and 55-139 $/ton CO2 (low season). In the cases where fuel prices reach 500
$/ton fuel, the total CCCO2 will be in the regions of 61-122 $/ton CO2 (high season) and 103-187 $/ton CO2
(low season).

Size of system
At a capture percentage of 90 %, the absorber column are around 11-12 meters of height and 3.0-3.3 meters
of diameter for all processes, see Table 7.12. The ammonia process requires two absorber columns for
minimizing clogging risks associated to processes with aqueous ammonia, see Chapter 2. The stripper
columns are much smaller, with diameters of around 1.1-1.3 meters and heights of 7.2-9.9 meters. The
reboilers are approximately the same size as the stripper columns with diameters of 1.6-1.8 meters and
heights of 4.7-6.0 meters.
At a capture percentage of 25 % (reducing the exhaust gas entering to 28 %), the diameter of the absorber
columns is reduced to 1.5-1.6 meters and the same height, see Table 7.12. The stripper columns are around
0.6 meters of diameter and the same height as before. No reboilers are needed, as the WHR units supply
enough steam for the stripping process. A noticeable system size reduction can be seen when reducing the
exhaust gas mass flow entering.

Regarding the equipment previously mentioned and restrictions in information, some conclusions can be
made for approximately 30 % of the total equipment required, called here “other equipment “. In the ET, the
height of the “other equipment” room can be chosen, in this case the height is 4 meters. Assuming the width
and length being the same, the width and length is calculated according to the height entered. The results of
“other equipment” room size can be seen in Table 7.13.
For a capture percentage of 90 %, the width and length of the “other equipment” room should be in the
region of 5.8x5.8 up to 6.8x6.8 meters for the equipment information available. A “void fraction” coefficient
of 200 % is entered as “total volume (equipment+ empty space) versus equipment volume occupation”,
meaning a doubling of equipment volume (200 %) leads to 50 % of the volume of the equipment room being
utilized for maintenance of the equipment and for crew to walk there (empty space).
For a capture percentage of 25 %, the width and length of the room is reduced to 3.2x3.2 up to 4.0x4.0 meters
for equipment currently available in the ET.

In Table 7.14, the volume of available equipment is multiplied by 3 and for the ammonia process by 3.5. This
serves as a guiding reference to where the equipment space and volume might end up. These values are
chosen as approximately 30 % of the equipment is available in the ET now.
For a capture rate of 90 %, with the same height of 4 meters the new CC system width and length become
10.1x10.1 up to 12.7x12.7 meters. The “void fraction” coefficient is 200 % in this case as well as before,
meaning half of the equipment room is empty space for maintenance work and other purposes.
Equipment added from the previous case are compressor, refrigeration equipment, burner, WHR units,
thermal reclaimer, LVC unit, solvent tank, exhaust gas cooling tower and condenser unit and additionally for
the ammonia process, pre-heater, separation column, CO2 recycle, saturation reactor, crystallizer and filter
section, see Table 7.14.
For a capture rate of 25 %, with the same height of 4 meters the width and length of the equipment room
become 5.6x5.6 up to 7.5x7.5 meters. The same “void fraction” of 200 % is utilized as before.
The weight of the CC system can be estimated similarly to the space and volume case. The equipment
unavailable with weight in the ET at present, is however larger than the case for space and volume occupied.
The weight is therefore multiplied by a factor of 5 and 6 (ammonia process), see Table 7.15. This serves as a
guiding reference and should be treated with high uncertainty. The weight of CO2 captured is not included.
For a capture percentage of 90 %, the total weight of system might reach 90-160 tons. At a capture
percentage of 25 %, the total weight of system might reach 35-65 tons.

Results- conclusion
The results are gathered here from the previously presented results. There is a certainty index in Table 7.16,
indicating the accuracy of the results. The CCCO2 is chosen at medium equipment cost and at 200 $/ton fuel.
Thereby, the CCCO2 is chosen to be the medium range for both fuel price and equipment cost assumption.
The transportation and storage costs are chosen to be 20 $/ton CO2 for both transportation and storage, for
a total of 40 $/ton CO2. As CCS is at early development especially for marine application, these ranges for
transportation and storage might even be too low, this is however difficult to predict accurately. The sale of
CO2 is another possibility, but not included. The capture percentage system of 25 % is excluded from total
results as it is used for system size comparison only.

8. Conclusions
The conclusions are divided into two sections, namely the technologies and the Excel tool. These sections
will provide recommendations and will serve as a discussion section as well. The technologies section
contains conclusions from Chapters 2 and 3. The Excel tool section contains conclusions for Chapters 4, 5, 6
and 7.

Technologies
The chemical absorption post-combustion CC technology is the most mature technology today. The thermal
stripping duty ranges from 2.33-3.6 GJ/ton CO2, depending on solvent and use of LVC/MVR or not. MEA and
Cansolv solvents have been demonstrated on power plants with promising results. The aqueous ammonia,
IL and PZ processes needs to be demonstrated but potential for power reductions over the MEA process are
expected. Future research is required, especially into mixing solvents and new solvent developments. The
physical absorption technology is considered inefficient and is excluded in this thesis.
The adsorption post-combustion CC technology is promising but not technologically mature. Physical
adsorption is more energy efficient than chemical adsorption. The physical adsorbents that are considered
are MOF, zeolites and carbonaceous materials. Increased adsorption capacity and selectivity are required for
the adsorption CC technology to be competitive with chemical absorption. The chemical adsorption
technology is energy intensive as chemical bonds are created in every loading cycle. Chemical adsorption can
be possible if materials with value are produced and sold (mineral carbonation). Further, regenerating the
adsorbent material is done through temperature, pressure, vacuum (temperature, pressure, vacuum swing)
and electric driving forces. Investigations into the combination of driving forces will lead to increased capture
percentage and CO2 product purity.
The membrane post-combustion CC technology is another promising technology but not technologically
mature. Demonstration projects have shown that membrane separation soon will be competitive with the
chemical absorption technology. The system size is promising for membrane CC technology, as membrane
modules are much smaller than amine absorption systems. Countercurrent and sweep module membrane
systems reduce the required membrane area and the power requirement over modules with crossflow.
The cryogenic post-combustion CC technology is another promising technology but not technologically
mature. The cryogenic CC technology consumes less total energy but more electrical power than the amine
absorption technology. The refrigeration equipment can utilize LNG as an ECL, for reducing power demand.
Additionally, the captured CO2 is very pure, 99+ percentage.

103

Geological storage is the most mature and cheapest storage option today. Ocean storage has a large capacity
for storage, but the environmental impacts will largely exclude the implementation of the technology.
Mineral carbonation is seen as the most expensive method, but if a mineral product can be produced and
sold, a business case might emerge. Industrial uses are storage of CO2 in chemical products, this storage
method will play a small part only, as the global market for industrial products will be much smaller than the
annual global CO2 emissions. Geological storage is thereby the most feasible for long-term storage of CO2
today.
CO2 is transported though pipelines and in ships. In pipelines the CO2 is transported in supercritical fluid phase
and in liquid phase in ships. For longer distances, shipping is cheaper as the transportation costs increase
slowly when increasing the distance. For shorter distances, pipelines are cheaper, but the transportation
costs increase fast when increasing the distance. For small volumes and long distances of CO2 transportation,
the shipping option is the cheapest option.

Excel tool
Carbon capture on marine vessels is limited by space and weight occupied onboard the vessel by capture
equipment and storage tanks, the utilities limitation and the constant movement of the vessel. The
operational route determines the voyage time and longer voyages will lead to larger volumes occupied of
storage tanks onboard the vessel. The identified placement of the carbon capture equipment is the exhaust
gas funnel section and other equipment is placed close to the exhaust gas funnel. The utilities limitation
relates to cooling water, electricity and steam consumption, these are provided by use of sea water,
increased engine load and reboiler operation. The constant movement of the vessel is not investigated in this
thesis and its impact on the process equipment needs to be addressed.
The operation of the carbon capture system will be challenging as the capture rate will decline after a certain
time of operation. The problem can be solved through operating the reboiler in such a way that the
temperature does not fall below the required temperature for regenerating the solvent. This will lead to
more fuel consumption; the alternative is large decrease in the capture percentage. Further investigations
will be required for running the carbon capture system most efficiently. The fast ramp-up of marine engines
will be a challenge and needs to be addressed in future works.
For future development of the ET, some proposals are given here. These are packing material choice for
designing the absorber and stripper columns, adding all equipment not yet entered, allowing for other engine
loads than 50 %, 75 %, 85 % and 100 % and adding transportation phase options.

104

Much (and perhaps most) equipment have not been entered into the tool, thereby, results of system size
and cost are highly uncertain. Adding this equipment information would eliminate these uncertainties.
Adding the option for entering engine loads at all engine loads possible, would allow for fine tuning of the
carbon capture system size. At the moment, the engine load for vessels running on 62 % engine load is chosen
at 75 %, as it is closest to the real engine load of 62 %. The error in mass flows are in these cases quite
significant, as the exhaust gas mass flow at 75 % engine load is larger than at 62 % engine load, leading to a
larger CC system than needed.
Adding the transportation phase option would allow for choice in transportation phase and for the electrical
power consumption to change according to the transportation phase option chosen. The solid CO2
transportation option would increase the electrical power consumption the most and supercritical CO2 the
least.

Aurora Botnia Results:

Price $/ton CO2:
For the high season scenario for Aurora Botnia, the CCCO2 for capture only will fall in the region of 9.4-65.9
$/ton CO2 (Table 7.10), including the storage and transportation costs, the total CCCO2 falls in the region of
20-122 $/ton CO2 (Figure 7.1).
For the low season scenario for Aurora Botnia, the CCCO2 for capture only will fall in the region of 26.1-130.8
$/ton CO2 (Table 7.11), including the storage and transportation costs, the total CCCO2 falls in the region of
35-187 $/ton CO2 (Figure 7.2).
The fuel price variation of 74, 200 and 500 $/ton fuel and the assumed equipment cost variation of low,
medium and high estimations provide a very broad CCCO2 range. Utilizing the medium fuel price, equipment
cost and transportation and storage costs, the total CCCO2 for the high season will be 60-70 $/ton CO2 and
for the low season scenario, 95-100 $/ton CO2, see Table 7.16.
Columns:
Regarding the size of the CC system on Aurora Botnia, the column diameter and height for 90 % capture
percentage will be around 11-12 meters of height and 3.0-3.3 meters of diameter for the absorber column,
around 7-10 meters of height and 1.1-1.3 meter of diameter for the stripper column and around 5-6 meters
of height and 1.6-1.8 meters of diameter for the reboilers. Fitting these columns will require quite a lot of
105

space inside the exhaust gas funnel and exhaust gas cooling tower will be included as the ET is developed
further, increasing system size even more. Retrofitting these columns on existing vessels will be difficult.
For the 25 % capture percentage case, the absorber column diameter will be reduced from about 3.2-3.6
meters to about 1.5-1.6 meters in diameter, same height. The stripper column diameter will be reduced from
1.1-1.3 to around 0.6 meters, same height. Reboilers are not needed as the WHR units supply enough steam.
Other equipment:
The process equipment space required for Aurora Botnia, will be for 90 % capture percentage in the region
of 4x11x11 meters. As mentioned, equipment space and costs of the CC system are highly uncertain.
The process equipment space required for Aurora Botnia, will be for 25 % capture percentage in the region
of 4x6x6 meters. As mentioned, equipment space and costs of the CC system are highly uncertain.
Energy penalty, emissions and fuel consumptions increase:
Regarding the energy penalty, only electrical power, the total energy penalty will be in the region of 7-15 %
for the high season scenario and 9-19 % for the low season scenarios. Emissions will increase in the region of
3-17 % for the high season scenario and 22-38 % for the low season scenario, over the base case of no CC
system installed (only reboiler emissions, see Chapter 7). Fuel consumption will increase likewise, with 13-26
% for the high season scenario and 31-46 % for the low season scenario, over the base case. The higher fuel
and emissions increases arrive from the low season scenario not having WHR available. To the contrary, the
high season scenario can utilize WHR from two out of four engines installed, reducing reboiler size, and thus,
decreasing emissions of CO2 and fuel consumption.

The MEA technology is the most energy intensive and the Cansolv+LVC technology the least energy intensive.
Overall, the Cansolv+LVC technology require the least thermal energy, equipment size, fuel consumption and
emits the least CO2. The aqueous ammonia technology requires the most electrical power and occupies the
most space additionally. The cases where LVCs are incorporated, the emissions and fuel consumption
decrease, at the expense of more electrical power requirement, and thus more energy penalty. Regarding
the CCCO2, the MEA technology is the most expensive and the Cansolv+LVC the cheapest technology per
captured ton of CO2.
The restrictions in the ET are related to process equipment entered. The fuel consumption of engines and
reboilers are relatively accurate, limited only by the efficiency of electrical and mechanical propulsion,
assumed to be 100 % efficient. The accuracy of densities, viscosities and more of fluids and gases at different
temperatures and pressures are also important. Additionally, the assumed values are important. The
106

accuracy of the ET can be increased with time as better and better assumed values and possibly better fluid
and gas properties will be added into the tool.
Another area with restrictions is storage and transportation costs, but the ET allows for entry of costs by the
user. It is possible for the user to customize costs related to what happens to the CO2 once it is discharged in
harbor. For future development, the equipment would be most important to add. It is recommended to start
with process equipment addition. Afterwards, the engine load selection could be changed such that the user
can enter other engine loads than what is possible right now.

Feasibility assessment:
Regarding the feasibility of implementing a CC system on Aurora Botnia, it might be possible to install, but
with some pre-conditions. The funnel section should be wide enough, room for equipment is required and
the fuel tanks should be able to supply fuel to the reboiler and extra engine fuel for increased engine load
operation.

•

For the 90 % capture percentage case on Aurora Botnia, the CC system size might be too large. This
CC system could be installed on ship newbuilds if the vessel is designed to handle the equipment size
and weight. However, it might be possible to install the system if the conditions previously
mentioned are fulfilled.

•

For the 25 % capture percentage case on Aurora Botnia, the CC system size might be possible to
install if the conditions previously mentioned are fulfilled.

•

The supply of cooling utilities, steam to the stripper column and electricity to the CC system are
entirely possible.

•

The start-up of the CC system will be complicated, as the capture percentage will decrease and
increase afterwards slowly. It is possible to perform the start-up efficiently, but research is needed
into control systems for operation.

•

The total CCCO2 will most probably be around 60-100 $/ton CO2.

9. Swedish summary- Svensk sammanfattning

Koldioxiduppfångning och lagring
Genomförbarhet inom marina tillämpningar

Inledning:
I denna avhandling undersöks tekniker för koldioxiduppfångning och tekniker för att lagra och transportera
koldioxid. Tekniker för koldioxiduppfångning är uppdelade i absorption, adsorption, membran och
kryogeniska system.
Ett excel-verktyg skapas för att uppskatta storlek och kostnad för ett koldioxiduppfångningssystem.
Utmaningar gällande dessa system kommer också att behandlas, till exempel var systemet kan placeras och
hur systemet kan startas och stängas av. Ett verkligt fartyg, Aurora Botnia, används som ett exempel på hur
excel-verktyget kan användas.

Absorption delas in i kemisk och fysisk absorption, kemisk absorption är lönsammare än fysisk absorption
och är därmed endast utforskad i denna avhandling. Kemiska absorptionslösningsmedel är till exempel
monoetanolamin, Cansolv DC-103, ammonium, jonvätska och piperazin. Kemisk absorption är den mest
använda tekniken i dag för koldioxiduppfångning. Inom absorptionssystem används absorptions- och
regenereringskolumner för absorption och desorption av koldioxid.
Adsorption delas in i kemisk och fysisk adsorption. Kemisk adsorption binder koldioxid kemiskt medan fysisk
adsorption fäster koldioxiden på sin yta. Regenereringen av adsorbent sker med värme, tryck, vakuum eller
elektrisk drivkraft. Kombineringen av tryck eller vakuum och värme leder till en högre uppfångningsprocent
av koldioxid och en högre renhet av koldioxiden.
Membransystem är fysiska separationssystem. Drivkraften för separationen kommer från tryck eller vakuum.
Membranytan och energiåtgången reduceras med motströmsmembran och svepmoduler, jämfört med
genomströmningsmembran. Användningen av två seriekopplade membran möjliggör koldioxiduppfångning
upp till 90 %. Membransystem är också mindre än absorptionssystem eftersom inga höga absorptions- och
desorptionskolumner behövs.

108

Kryogenisk koldioxiduppfångning är en teknik där rökgas kyls ner till circa -120 °C så att koldioxiden
sublimerar till fast fas och separeras därmed från rökgasen. Fördelar med teknologin är föroreningskontroll,
reducerad vattenkonsumtion och reducerad energiåtgång, jämfört med absorptionstekniken.

Koldioxid kan lagras i geologiska formationer, i oceanerna, i mineralform och som industriell produktråvara.
Geologisk lagring är den enda mogna långtidslagringsmetoden i dag. Oceanisk lagring har en enorm
lagringskapacitet, men osäkerheten kring koldioxidens påverkan på marina varelser är extensiv.
Mineraliseringslagring är dyrast men om produkter kan säljas skulle tekniken kunna vara lönsam. Om
koldioxiden används inom industrin, kan bränslen och kemiska produkter produceras. Den totala
lagringskapaciteten för koldioxid inom industrin är som högst 1–2 % av det totala årliga koldioxidutsläppet i
världen. Geologisk lagring, oceanisk lagring och mineralisering kommer vara viktigare ur ett globalt
lagringskapacitetsperspektiv.
Transport av koldioxid sker genom skeppstransport och rörledningar. Koldioxid transporteras i flytande form
på skepp och i superkritisk flytande form i rörledningar. Transport av koldioxid i fastform och gasform är
olönsamt. Skeppstransport är billigast på långa transportavstånd och i liten volym. Rörledningstransport är
billigare än skeppstransport då volymerna är stora och transportsträckorna är korta.

Centralt inom den finansiella analysen är kostnaden för varje ton av koldioxid uppfångat ($/ton CO2).
Kostnaden för varje ton av uppfångat koldioxid räknas från den totala årliga kostnaden för systemet och
divideras med mängden koldioxid uppfångat varje år. De totala årliga kostnaderna räknas ut från kapitala och
löpande kostnader (CAPEX och OPEX). Kapitala kostnader räknas ut från utrustningskostnaderna och löpande
kostnader från förbrukningen av bränsle och lösningsmedel.

Uppfångningssystem för koldioxid begränsas av utrymme, förbrukningen av råvaror och konstant rörelse av
fartyget. Uppfångningssystemet för koldioxid placeras i skorstenen och annan utrustning i närheten. Råvaror
som kallvatten tas från havet och används i värmeväxlare för kylning av processvatten och dylika vätskor.
Vattenånga kommer från värmepannor där vatten förångas för regenerering av lösningsmedel. Konstant
vibration från fartyget kan leda till eventuella problem med förslitningar av processutrustning och fortsatt
forskning krävs inom detta område.
Uppfångningssystem för koldioxid kommer att behöva kontrollsystem för uppstart och avstängning av
systemet. Ett stort fall i koldioxid uppfångningsprocenten kommer att hända eftersom temperaturen i

109

regenereringskolumnen faller då avgasmassflödet ökar snabbt och koldioxidmängden i lösningsmedlet ökar.
Detta kan pågå enda upp till 2,5 timmar. En lösning skulle vara körning av värmepannan så att temperaturen
i regenereringskolumnen är tillräckligt hög för att regenereringen skall hända. I absorptionssystem med MEA
som lösningsmedel ska temperaturen vara cirka 120 °C för regenereringen. Mera forskning behövs dock inom
detta område.

Det excel-verktyg, som skapas i denna avhandling är gjord för att uppskatta storlekar och energiförbrukningar
av koldioxid uppfångningssystem. Många antagelser är gjorda eftersom information kring temperatur, tryck
och massflöden är inte givna inom litteraturkällor.
En hemsida skapas där användaren av verktyget kan mata in information om fartyget, till exempel driftsprofil,
lagringstid, uppfångningsprocent och antalet motorer installerade på fartyget. I tabeller gjorda i excelverktyget finns källreferenser med källhänvisning eller antagna värden för kalkyler.
Excel-verktyget fungerar så att avgasmassflödet räknas ut, därefter räknas massflödet av lösningsmedel i
uppfångningssystemet för koldioxid. Kylning och uppvärmningsprocesser tas också i beaktande.
Processutrustningen kan nu dimensioneras då massflöden in och ut ur systemet är kända. Den verkliga
processutrustningen hittas på nätet och matas in i excel-verktyget och utgående från information som höjd,
bredd, längd, vikt, energikonsumtion och kostnad för processutrustningen, kan ekvationer skapas med hjälp
av ”Excel Charts” och trendlinjer. Med dessa ekvationer räknas processutrustningens storlek och kostnader
ut. En tabell innehållande all processutrustning skapas för att samla in all information på
processutrustningsbehov.
Restriktioner för excel-verktyget är relaterade till processutrustningen, eftersom all processutrustning inte
kunde hittas under arbetets gång. För framtida utvecklingar av verktyget, rekommenderas tillsättningen av
kvarvarande processutrustning. Detta skulle möjliggöra uträkningar av alla systemstorlekar av
uppfångningssystem för koldioxid. I nuvarande version av verktyget, uppskattas återstående kostnader och
storlekar på processutrustningar för en systemstorlek på 15 MWel.

Resultat kan nu inhämtas från verktyget. Kostnaden för varje ton av uppfångat koldioxid kommer sannolikt
att vara ungefär 60–100 $/ton koldioxid. Det elektriska energiförbrukningsstraffet kommer att vara 7–19 %,
bränslekonsumtionen ökar med cirka 13–46 % och koldioxidutsläppen ökar med cirka 3–38 % (bara
värmepanna, se kapitel 7).

110

Absorptionskolumnen kommer att ha en höjd på cirka 11-12 meter och en diameter på 3,0-3,3 meter.
Desorptionskolumnen kommer att ha en höjd på cirka 7-10 meter och en diameter på 1,1-1,3 meter.
Värmepannan kommer att vara cirka 5-6 meter hög med en diameter på 1.6-1.8 meter. Exakta resultat hittas
i kapitel 7. Alla dessa resultat är för 90 % uppfångningsprocent. En uppfångningsprocent på 25 % leder till
absorptionskolumner med en diameter på cirka 1,5-1,6 meter och desorptionskolumner med en diameter på
cirka 0,6 meter, båda kolumnerna med samma höjd som tidigare. Värmepanna behövs inte i fallet med lägre
uppfångningsprocent.
Storleken på utrymmen för processutrustning kommer att vara i storleken 4x11x11 meter för 90 %
uppfångningsprocent. För en uppfångningsprocent på 25 % behövs cirka 4x6x6 meter med utrymme.

Avslutning:
Kan ett koldioxid uppfångningssystem installeras på Aurora Botnia? Med en uppfångningsprocent på 90 %
kommer systemet att vara för stort, i fallet med en uppfångningsprocent på 25 % kan det vara möjligt.
Följande villkor måste uppfyllas: tillräckligt med utrymme i skorstenarna behövs för kolumnerna, tillgång till
elektricitet och kallvatten behövs och tillräckligt med utrymme för övrig processutrustning finns. Om dessa
inte uppfylls kan systemet inte installeras.

Appendix F.3: Stripper diameter and height calculations.
To calculate the stripper column diameter and height, the same equations are used as for the absorber
column calculations. The absorption factor in equations (43) and (44) will be the stripping factor for the
stripper column calculations, see equation (53).

Appendix F.4: Equilibrium line determination.
The equilibrium line is determined through Raoult´s law. Partial pressure of CO2 is divided by the pressure of
the system, in this case the absorber or stripper column pressures. Raoult´s law require the system to behave
ideally and additionally cannot be utilized at pressures above 4 bar. [78]

The partial pressures of CO2 in aqueous 30 wt-% MEA solutions are available in Figure F.4.1. For the absorber
columns, 10 kPa is chosen as the temperature will increase in the bottom of the absorber column to about
60 °C [90]. Intercooling will be utilized but to what degree the column temperature will be decreased is not
fully known. The higher values for partial pressure was chosen for estimating the column heights as a higher
partial pressure will lead to higher columns. The mol fraction of CO2 in aqueous MEA is chosen at the highest
loading point when exhaust gas enters the absorber column and the solvent is fully loaded, see Table F.4.2.
The value utilized, 10 kPa, is chosen as a value between 40 and 60 °C to account for possible heat build-up
inside the column. The Cansolv process partial pressure for CO2 is assumed to be the same as for the MEA
process as this solvent is proprietary. The partial pressure for the ammonia process is 17.85 kPa, value from
[91]. The partial pressure of CO2 for the second absorber column (ammonia process) is assumed to be 4 kPa,
as no data could be found. The value was chosen as higher values lead to calculation errors. The calculations
of column heights should be treated with significant uncertainty.

Comparing results from [50] and [92] for 90 % capture rate, the absorber column heights will be in the region
12.5-23.7 meters. The results for the absorber column heights in this thesis will be 11.2-12.5 meters for MEA
and Cansolv processes, with the partial pressures currently utilized. The results for column heights are highly
dependent on what partial pressure is chosen for determining the equilibrium line. The validity of current
values is not enough for designing a column precisely, but an initial estimation can be performed with
significant uncertainty.
138

Table F.4.2: Solubility of CO2 in 30 wt-% aqueous MEA solvent. [89]

The partial pressure of CO2 for the stripper column is 700 kPa [89] for the MEA processes and assumed to be
1100 kPa for the Cansolv processes. The calculations could not be executed with the same partial pressure
for the Cansolv process as for the MEA process, gives error values. The value is assumed to be 1100 kPa, with
great uncertainty. The ammonia process stripper column could not be determined as the partial pressure
could not be found.
The system pressure is kept at 101.325 or 1 bar even though it should be selected at 2 bar. The reason for
this choice is the correlation to literature data and the lack of knowledge for determining the equilibrium
line, especially for the stripping process.
Comparing results in literature for stripper column height, for example, article [50] gives a stripper column
height of 6.5 meters for approximately the same exhaust gas mass flow as for Aurora Botnia. The results in
Chapter 7 gives stripper column heights of 7.2-9.0 meters. Once again, the column height is highly dependent
on the partial pressure supplied. In this thesis, the equilibrium line could not be determined fully, but a
correlation to literature has been utilized for obtaining relatively reasonable results.

Table F.4.4: Solubility of CO2 in 15 wt-% aqueous ammonia solvent. [91]

As a summary, the partial pressures should be checked for future work as the exact vapor-liquid equilibria
could not be determined in this thesis. The approach taken was to check the values obtained with values
from literature sources where column heights where calculated in programs such as Aspen Plus, for example
article [50].
