Title: Refreshing core values at KPMG: Understanding the organizational identity
trough communicating the core values
Supervisor: Maria Ivanova-Gongne
Abstract:
This master’s thesis introduces the case company KPMG Finland’s new core values and the
corporate identity of the organization. The study contains four key themes: corporate identity,
perception of core values, core value behavior and communication of the core values. The
research investigates whether the core values, including the new values, have an impact on the
corporate identity. It reveals how the employees perceive the core values and how the internal
communication of the values affects the employees.
KPMG has recently launched their refreshed core values. It could be said that previous
research within the company shows little evidence of whether the employees understand the
core values of KPMG in a desired manner. The interviews are focusing on two generations:
baby boomers and millennials. The extent of previous research on the topic is narrow when
viewing two different generation’s perceptions of the employer’s corporate identity and core
values.
The research shows that there is no substantial difference in the answers between the two
generations. The perceived corporate identity of all the respondents pursue a congruent
direction. The millennials and baby boomers feel that KPMG is a human-centric and
conservative organization with a lot of knowledge. The respondents are not familiar with the
refreshed core values in this early state of the launching process. After the values have been
shown to the respondents in the interview, they have shared their reactions and feelings of the
core values. Both generations can relate to the core values and can make use of them in their
work. The refreshed core values are seemed as more challenging to understand compared to
the old ones.

1. Introduction
It could be said that more action could be taken in managing and “living” up to the
core values in organizations. This master’s thesis introduces the case company KPMG
Finland’s new core values and the corporate identity of the organization. The research
investigates whether the new core values have an impact on corporate identity, and it
reveals how the employees perceive the core values.
Previous research and literature have indicated that organizational identity is key to
the success of the strategic action of an organization. Organizational identity can be
strategically built and improved to support the goals of the organization and to lead
the members of an organization to the strategic action desired by the management.
When the key components of organizational identity are congruent and in synergy,
organizations can establish a strong identity. This will provide the opportunity for
organizational activity and behave in a way that offers the greatest chance of success
in achieving the organizational goals. (Dhalla, 2007)
According to Lencioni (2002), there is a risk when companies attempt to change or
improve their existing values, as they can be empty rhetoric. If the value statements
become empty, they create dispirited employees, drive a wedge between customers,
and threaten the managerial credibility. Therefore, there is considerable virtue in terms
of a coherent culture that underpins external brand positioning, but also a downside
risk in terms of resignation and loss of credibility. (Lencioni, 2002).
According to previous research conducted by Chakraverty (2018), 74% of UK
employees working in the IT sector want to be more involved in contributing to the
vision and values. The research reveals that nearly half of employees cannot recite the
core values. Furthermore, those aged above 45 were least likely to be able to recite
their company’s vision. Two case studies conducted by Balmer and Wilson (1998)
show that the goal of organizations, core values shared by all employees, may be
unattainable. They suggest using the term organization’s corporate identities, rather
than a single identity. However, it could be said that the goal is to have one identity
and without behaving accordingly, it is challenging to achieve congruent perceptions
and shared values by the employees.

Balmer and Wilson (1998) remark that corporate identity is a complex phenomenon,
difficult to be managed. de Chernatony and Harris (2000) note that the internalization
of the core values is greater among internal stakeholders when they identify with the
corporate brand. This will lead to a more consistent presentation of the brand’s
identity. If the core values of the brand are congruent with the stakeholder’s personal
values, the reputation of the brand will be favorable. Chakraverty (2018) encourages
companies to rethink and refresh the vision and values to make sure they are up to
date. Neill (2016) observes that organizations should review their core values to find
any inconsistencies in their policies and reward systems, and then make necessary
changes.
This thesis will research if there is an incongruence in the answers between two
different generations considering corporate core values. The generations are baby
boomers, born between the years 1946 and 1964, and millennials, born between the
years 1980 and 2000. The findings are conducted by interviewing employees from
both generations. The brand team is also interviewed to investigate the desired core
value characteristics and organizational identity.
Myers and Sadaghiani (2010) state that millennials are known to be exceedingly
affected by communication, information technologies, and economics. Usually, they
have a broader perspective of supervisor-subordinate relationships, cultural diversity,
the performance of tasks, and ways that communication can be used to improve
organizational performance and productivity. According to Myers and Sadaghiani
(2010), the behavior of the millennials can be viewed as opportunities and that the key
for baby boomers is to interact with millennials to learn from each other.
Baby boomers are predominant in senior positions in most organizations and most of
them are retiring in the upcoming years. Baby boomers are known to be loyal to their
employers and seek long-term employment. They value teamwork and they believe in
success from hard work. (Jorgensen, 2003).
The case company is KPMG Finland, which is recognized by being one of the “Big 4”
companies. The “Big 4” refers to the four largest accounting firms in the world. The
organization provides services in audit, tax, legal, and other business advisory services.
This thesis discovers the influence of core values on organizational identity and its
perception by employees. The core values introduce the base of the identity and
7

Daniel Stenbäck

managers’ role is to introduce them and promote the message to the employees to have
congruent behavior and values.

1.1.

The importance of the topic

One could say that there is too little evidence of whether employees understand the
core values of KPMG in the desired manner, especially when KPMG has recently
launched its refreshed core values. The extent of previous research on the topic is
narrow when viewing two different generation’s perceptions of their employer’s
corporate identity and core values.
It is discussed in the literature, that the understanding and implementation of the core
values for a corporate brand are often insufficient and unattainable. It is too naïve to
say, that all employees have the same values as the organization. Today, many
employees expect their employers to share their personal values. Nevertheless, the
more the employees share and understand the corporate core values, the greater the
outcomes are regarding job satisfaction, job engagement, perceptual congruence, and
corporate success. These outcomes are introduced in the theory and literature of this
thesis. According to Lievens, Hoye and Anseel (2007), previous studies have paid little
attention to the particular components that define the perceived organizational identity
of employees and their interpreted external image of the organizations.

1.2.

Aim and research questions

This thesis includes four research questions, which are listed below. The research will
discover the answers to these questions by interviewing KPMG employees from two
different generations. The central aim of this research is to observe how the change of
core values impacts the corporate identity and its perception by the employees. The
answers to the research questions are revealed in the discussion chapter. The research
questions referring to this study are:
1. Theoretical research question: How do corporate values impact corporate identity?
8

Daniel Stenbäck

2. Empirical research question: How do the new corporate values of KPMG affect its
corporate identity?
3. Empirical research question: How are the new values perceived by young vs. more
experienced employees?
4. Normative research question: How can companies ensure a coherent corporate
identity when communicating change in corporate values?

1.3.

Terms and definitions

This thesis is supported by several key terms that form the basis for the theory and
literature review. The terms are: Corporate identity, Core values, Internal
communication, Organizational culture and Employer branding. The definitions of the
terms are listed below. The terms are relevant and help to understand the core of the
research in the thesis. The terms are briefly explained to give the reader a short
examination of the forthcoming theory and literature review.

Corporate identity
The fundamental ground for the corporate culture and corporate brand is established
by corporate identity. When creating the corporate identity, the identification and the
policies for communication will occur. One of the main aims of corporate identity is
that it creates a unique identification of the organization that is recognizable by the
employees. (Balmer, 2008). Some authors observe that this definition should be called
organizational identity. The definitions are used in the literature to some extent
interchangeably and are seen to overlap and that is why this thesis will apply them
synonymously.

Core values
Core values reveal the fundamental beliefs and principles that an organization views
as centrally important. They act as cultural cornerstones and standards of behavior for
9

Daniel Stenbäck

the organization. Core values clarify the identity of the organization and support
differentiation from competitors. (Lencioni, 2002).

Internal communication
Organizational communication can be divided into two different categories: external
and internal communication. External communication regards customer relationship
management and communication with other external stakeholders. The internal aspect
of this thesis involves the communication between employees and the employer. The
aim of internal communication is to create a brand, culture and employee experience.
There is a clear link between employer engagement and effective internal
communication. Employer engagement is one of the key elements of employer
branding. (Cowie, 2019).

Employer branding
Employer branding represents the efforts of an organization to cultivate a clear vision
of what makes it unique and attractive as an employer, both within and outside the
organization. It combines the principles of marketing and human resource
management. This thesis focuses on the internal part of employer branding as the
research in it regards the employees of KPMG. Employer branding is used to maintain
the organizational culture and assure the employees are engaged in it. (Backhaus &
Tikoo, 2004). The research in this thesis will help to find out if the new core values
affect the organizational culture.

Organizational culture
Culture reflects the common beliefs and feelings that employees have in an
organization. It is built by the roots, principles, and values of the organization.
Organizational culture provides the context that involves employees working together
and their relationships with clients and other stakeholders. (Balmer & Greyser, 2006).
Griffin (2011) points out that culture is related to share understanding by the
employees.

Limitations

The academic concepts of corporate identity, communication, and core value
perception are broad research areas. They can be discovered from the internal
perspective and from the external point of view. This thesis focuses on organizational
identity, which is the internal aspect of corporate branding. It explains how internal
communication supports the launch of core values and how they are introduced to the
employees.
This thesis is limiting its scope on the internal perceptions of corporate identity and
core values. Further research is suggested on the external perceptions of the clients and
other outside audiences. The external perceptions affect not only the corporate identity
but also the image and reputation of the company. Corporate reputation is introduced
briefly in this thesis and it is explained how it correlates to corporate brand identity.
The relation of employer branding to corporate identity is explained at the end of the
literature review.

1.5.

Structure of the thesis

This master’s thesis includes six main chapters, starting with the introduction, which
gives the reader an understanding of the topic and forms the background to the
research. The following chapter is the literature section, which includes academic
articles, books, and journals focusing on the key terms of the study. It begins by
introducing corporate identity and continues with organizational culture and core
values. It is followed by a chapter of corporate reputation and communication of the
core values. After the last theory chapter of employer branding, the methodology of
the research is introduced by revealing the research methods, and the validity and
reliability of the study.

The fourth chapter includes the findings of the empirical study and is followed by a
summary and a discussion of the findings. The researcher introduces suggestions for
further research and acknowledgments, followed by a Swedish summary of the thesis.

2. Theory and literature review
This chapter introduces the theory that supports the empirical part of this study. The
theory helps answering the research questions and gives the reader base knowledge
about the topic. The theory begins by introducing corporate identity.

2.1.

Building corporate identity

Every organization has an identity. It reveals the corporate values and presents a sense
of individuality that helps the organization to differentiate from its competitors. (de
Chernatony & Harris 2000). Organizational culture and core values are the building
blocks of corporate identity. Their relation to corporate identity is introduced after the
first chapter.

2.2.

Corporate identity

Corporate identity needs support from all stakeholders and requires good management
to build a common understanding and commitment among the organization’s
stakeholders. Corporate identity is defined by de Chernatony and Harris (2000) in
terms of an organization’s goals and values that create a sense of individuality that
differentiates the brand. Organizational identity is what organization members
consider to be central to the organization and what distinguishes the organization from
others. It reveals what employees perceive as a continuing or enduring feature that
12

Daniel Stenbäck

links the present organization with past, and preferably, to the future organization. Like
individuals, organizations decide who they are by using a certain classification scheme
and then locate themselves within that scheme. (Gioia, 1998)
No one today will question the strategic importance of corporate identity to modern
organizations. According to Balmer (2008), corporate identity gives the fundamental
platform to corporate culture and the corporate brand. Hatch and Schultz (1997)
explain corporate identity as being a commonly shared understanding of the corporate
core values and characteristics. Corporate identity results from shared associations,
interpretations and understandings. (Hatch & Schultz, 1997). According to Balmer and
Wilson (1998), corporate identity helps employees to adapt to the organizational
culture and acts as a driver to motivate and acquire a greater amount of support of the
employees. Organizational members develop their identity not only concerning what
others say about them but also regarding who they perceive they are (Hatch & Schultz,
2002). de Chernatony and Harris (2000) mention that greater coordination and
consistency between internal stakeholders are needed to present a coherent corporate
brand identity.
The identification with the corporation and the communication policies will occur
when creating a corporate identity. (Balmer, 2008). Top-level managers communicate
the symbolic construction of corporate identity to organizational members. However,
this is interpreted and approved by organizational members based on the
organization’s cultural patterns, work experiences, and social influences from external
relations with the environment. (Hatch & Schultz, 1997). Organizational identity is
built, in addition to external factors with intra-organizational factors. The factors that
contribute to the construction of organizational identity internally are the board of
directors, top management team, HRM practices, operations and internal
communication. (Dhalla, 2007). Thus, the role of the employees in constructing the
organizational identity cannot be put aside.
According to Urde (2009), every corporate brand should include three dimensions:
Functional, symbolic and emotional dimensions. These dimensions should be included
in the core brand identity.
“Identity is not something genetic, safe, and secure. It is shaped by history and culture:
it is about group feeling; allegiance to the state: it is, too, a common sense of culture,
13

Daniel Stenbäck

custom and language, to be sure, but in an open society that can be wide and inclusive.
It is always in the making and never made.” (Wood, 2000).
While employees’ presentation of the identity of their brand will affect the perceptions
of customers, the behavior of managers will affect the perceptions of employees and
acceptance of the brand identity (de Chernatony & Harris, 2000). Harris and de
Chernatony (2001) reveal that even though having this said, managers and employees
tend to have different perceptions of their brands’ identity. This thesis will investigate
if the millennials in KPMG have incongruent perceptions of the brands’ identity
compared to baby boomers, who have more experience working for KPMG. Brand
team members have a vital role in this context, since they must first surface their own
perceptions and explain the intended identity of the brand. When this is done, they
should collaborate with the employees to make sure that their perceptions correspond
with the intended brand identity. Employees should then be encouraged to provide
feedback on how they find clients perceive the brand as a further check of coherence.
(Harris & de Chernatony, 2001)
Balmer (2001) has introduced five different identity types. All five identity types
should be in close alignment to be supreme. The five identity types, called “Dr.
Balmer’s ACID Test” are the following:
1.

the actual identity (internal values, organizational behavior, activities, market
scope, performance and positioning);

2.

the communicated identity (the various organizational messages conveyed via
primary,

secondary

and

tertiary

communications:

``total

corporate

communication’’);
3.

the conceived identity (the images/representations, reputational profile held of
the organization by stakeholder groups and networks);

4.

the ideal identity (the optimum positioning for the organization in a given time
frame); and

5. the desired identity (the vision as articulated by corporate founder and/or the
chief executive and management board).
It is important for organizations to manage their multiple types of identities to prevent
possible harmful misalignment. Various identity types appear to inhabit different
timeframes. Most notably, the conceived identity can lag behind the actual identity
14

Daniel Stenbäck

because stakeholder groups often need time to recognize gradual changes in reality. It
is a major task for managers to signal the change with communication campaigns.
(Balmer & Greyser, 2002). Corporate identity can be formed by the vision of
management (desired identity) and by a strategic goal of an organization that focuses
on a given time period (ideal identity). Consequently, this approach is informed by the
view that corporate identity should be dynamically and broadly aligned with
organizational communications (communicated identity) and should be adjusted by
the perceptions of stakeholders and customers. (Illia & Balmer, 2012)
Balmer’s approach can be used as a new methodology for change of corporate identity.
It assembles the prominent disciplinary standpoints which are important to an
understanding of a business identity, business activities, culture, performance,
communication, perception, strategy and leadership. (Balmer, 2001). A decade later,
Balmer (2012) added two more identity types to the corporate brand constellation: the
covenanted identity and the cultural identity. The ACID test has been refined, to be
called: The AC4ID Test (see the two added C’s). The covenanted identity stands for
what the company’s brand promise to be. The CEO and marketing managers are
responsible for defining the covenanted identity. Cultural identity includes internal
corporate brand values. The employees, with the support of the managers, are
responsible for formulating the cultural corporate brand identity. (Balmer, 2012).
Corporate identity has strong links to strategy and competitive advantage and is
therefore seen as dynamic and influential. Corporate identity can also be informative,
particularly in terms of addressing some fundamental marketing challenges, for
instance, the need for corporate behaviors and performance to reflect corporate
communications and corporate brand policies. (He & Balmer, 2007)
While marketing literature focuses on corporate identity, organizational literature has
developed the discussion around organizational identity. (Hatch & Schultz, 1997).
However, there has been a degree of convergence between the scholars of marketing
and organizational behavior in association with identity studies. The definitions have
been called as sister concepts due to their similarities. (He & Balmer, 2007). Compared
organizational identity to corporate identity, it is traditionally, been focusing on the
internal aspects and the employees. It has discussed to have a richer theoretical
foundation. (Balmer, 2008). Organizational identity describes in a wide perspective
how the members perceive, feel, and think about their organizations. It outlines to be
15

Daniel Stenbäck

a collective, commonly shared understanding of the distinctive values of the
organization. (Hatch & Schultz, 1997). The primary idea of organizational identity is
that the company can have an identifiable character, which can be recognized
especially by the employees. Presenting the identity of the organization can help to
outline the image of the company from the employer branding point of view. It will
actively present the key characteristics, image, and identity of the company by
introducing its shared values as part of an employer brand value proposition. (Edwards,
2009).
According to Balmer and Greyser (2003), corporate identity is a concern of marketers
and communicators, while organizational identity concerns more in particular the
organizational behaviorists. From their point of view, the concepts of organizational
identity and corporate identity are seemed as alter egos. They mention that this area
could be conceptualized more generally speaking as identity studies. He and Balmer
(2007) explain that organizational identity is the identity of the people within the
organization. Many authors use these definitions effectively and interchangeably
(Balmer & Greyser 2003). Having this said, the literature does not distinguish the
definitions of organizational identity and corporate identity to an extent, that they
could not be used interchangeably in this thesis. In addition to that, the interviewees in
this thesis are both managers and other employees. Hatch and Schultz (2002), He and
Balmer (2007) have examined the overlapping definitions assigned to organizational
culture and identity. They noted that these two terms cannot be separated since they
are so often used to describe one another. Moreover, in recent years the definitions
have started to inter-penetrate and overlap (Cornelissen, Haslam & Balmer, 2007).
Organizational culture is one element of organizational identity. According to Dvorak
(2016), communication, values, human capital resources, work teams, and
performance are among the most significant drivers of organizational identity. They
form how decisions are made, how employees behave, and how the work gets done.
Managers may apply them to coordinate employees with the organizational culture and
guide the organization towards its desired identity.

2.3.

Organizational culture as part of corporate identity

According to Schein (1992), culture can be seen as a platform of the social order that
we live in and of the rules we abide by. Culture is persistently enacted and founded by
our interactions with others and shaped by our actions. Culture indicates the stability
and stiffness in the way how we are supposed to perceive, feel, and behave in each
organization. Culture is not only around us but within us as well. (Schein, 1992).
According to Griffin (2011), culture relates to shared meaning, shared understanding
and shared sense-making.
Organizational culture implies all members of the organization, originates and evolves
at all hierarchical levels. (Hatch & Schultz, 1997). According to Balmer and Greyser
(2006), culture represents the collective feeling of employees being a part of a setting
in an entity. The roots, values, and assumptions of the organization are building the
feeling. Culture provides the context in which the employees work together and
address themselves with each other and with clients and other stakeholders. (Balmer
& Greyser, 2006). Thorbjørnsen and Supphellen (2011) explain that employees appear
as a bridge between outside stakeholder perceptions and the internal culture of the
company. Hatch and Schultz (2002) argue that when stakeholders agree with the
expressions of organizational identity their attitude binds them to the organizational
culture that is held in the traces of claims for identity. Processes that combine the
interests and activities from all relevant stakeholder groups result in a healthy
organizational identity. Dvorak (2016) argues that in many organizations, there is a
gap between the desired culture and the culture employees experience. The culture that
the management has envisioned and strived to be realized is not achieved. This causes
inconsistency and confusion among the employees and even worse, among the
customers.
The behavior of the employees needs to be coherent and aligned with the external
positioning of the brand for the service brand to be perceived by customers as
differentiated, attractive and consistent. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen, 2011). Since
people will be influenced by any type of organizational communications, companies
must make great effort to ensure that all activities regarding symbolism,

17

Daniel Stenbäck

communication, and behavior are coherent and the fundamental influence is positive
(Karaosmanoglu & Melewar, 2006).
Hatch and Schultz (1997) suggest that in explanations of the development and
maintenance of organizational identity, organizational culture must be addressed. They
also claim that the cultural context affects both image-influencing managerial
decisions and daily interactions between employees and outside audiences. They bring
an interesting point-of-view by stating that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish
between members inside and outside the organization. This is not only due to external
consultants and other part-time workers working within the organization. The
members of an organization interact with people outside the organization, are members
of external groups, and confront organizational symbols in their lives outside the
organization. It is therefore the symbols of organizational culture that become
important sources of building identity and image. Organizational culture can be seen
as a symbolic context in which interpretations of organizational identity are formed
and in which intentions are formulated to influence the organizational image. It is
focused on a broad-based history that is known in the organization’s material aspects,
such as names, products, buildings, and logos, including its top managers. (Hatch &
Schultz, 1997).

2.4.

Core values

Core values represent the fundamental principles that guide all of a company’s actions
and functions as its cultural cornerstones. (Lencioni, 2002). Core values steer
managers and employees in identifying which principles and behaviors are right and
which are wrong. Employees should be involved in selecting the core values, and the
communication of those is crucial to make them stick. (Franz, 2019). In the Oxford
dictionary (2013), values are defined by “The principles or standards of behavior;
one’s judgment of what is important in life”. The definition for a core value is therefore
concluded by “A principle or belief that a person or organization views as being of
central importance”. Rockeach (1973) continues by emphasizing values being the
concept of fundamental beliefs and unwritten standards that gives a guideline for
judgments and behavior in different situations. Recognizing the importance of core
18

Daniel Stenbäck

values in a corporation has a major impact on success and effectiveness. The purpose
of core values is to establish a framework of standards that should underlie in the
workplace, how they interact with each other and clients.
Values have served as a critical component of the organization’s viewpoint recently
regarding strategic direction and the foundation of corporate mission and vision.
(Williams, 2002). The values within an organization answer the basic questions of who
we are, how we work, and what makes us who we are as an organization. The question
“who we are?” is directly related to corporate identity, which is a central aspect of this
thesis. The values are created by the organizational culture with multiple sources.
(McCracken, 2005). Balmer and Greyser (2003, p.33) continue by mentioning that
corporate identity involves central concerns regarding “Who are we?” and “What are
we?”.
Core values can help companies to differentiate from their competitors by clarifying
their identity and serving as an assembling point for employees. Nonetheless, 55% of
all Fortune 100 organizations assert that honesty is a core value, 49% claim customer
satisfaction, and 40% of all teamwork. (Lencioni, 2002).
In a research conducted in the United States, it was found that only 23% of the
employees of the U.S. strongly agree that they can make use of the core values in their
work every day. Not more than 27% strongly believed in the core values of their
organization. (Dvorak, 2016).
To come up with strong values and being able to stick to them requires real courage.
Formulating a core value statement is a painful process that companies should be ready
for. According to Lencioni (2002) and Franz (2019), core values should be integrated
into every employee-related process to be truly integrated into the organization.
Lencioni (2002) explains that companies need to include core values to everything
from hiring methods to promotions and rewards, from the first interview to the last day
of work. Employees should be continuously reminded that the core values outline the
basis of each decision the company makes. Lencioni (2002) points out that it takes
time to integrate values in the organization by citing: ”Top managers also need to
understand that a good values program is like a fine wine; it’s never rushed.”
(Lencioni, 2002)

de Chernatony and Harris (2000) suggest that workshops may be organized to increase
employees’ understanding of the identity of the corporate brand, the need for
orientation between components and involve employees in identifying how the desired
values can be translated in behavior. Employees should also be informed of behavior
that does not support the desired values and ways in which inconsistencies are
resolved.
Urde (2009) explains that all established corporate brands have core values that
assemble the backbone of their brand track record. Track record means in this context
demonstrated performance and proof that the company has lived according to its
promises and values over time. (Urde, 2009). The core values are not always defined
and may also vary in number. Bengley and Boyd (2000) mention that the number of
core values is recommended to be three to six. It may also vary to what extent they
are grounded internally and how they are perceived by the clients and other
stakeholders. (Urde et al., 2007). It is vital for the management of brands to know what
values the clients appreciate the company for overtime and what values the company
stands for. Urde (2009) concludes by a strong statement: “A corporate brand cannot
be stronger externally than it is rooted internally”. This means that the values rooted
in the company need to resonate with the perceived values. (Urde, 2009).
Once employees understand the core values and are aligned with them, they have a
better appreciation of their positions and a greater dedication to fulfilling the promise
of the brand, resulting in higher brand performance. The employees may say one thing
in a given situation and do quite different altogether if the values are not internalized.
It is therefore unnecessary to hope that the employees simply “live” the written values,
without communicating them correctly. (Chong, 2007). The importance of how the
clients appreciate them over time plays a vital role as well. The framework of brand
orientation (Figure 1) introduced by Urde (2009) implicates that corporate brand
building is an ongoing interaction between the organizational identity, identity of the
customer, and the identity of the corporate brand core values. This thesis is not going
to focus on the identity of the customer, even though it is a central part of the value
foundation.
The corporate brand core values in the middle of the figure define the corporate
identity and support the promise of the brand. The values have the role of guiding the

20

Daniel Stenbäck

brand-building efforts internally and externally. The value foundation of a corporate
brand is built together with organizational values, brand core values and perceived
values. (Urde 2009).

Figure 1 The value foundation of a corporate brand
(Urde 2009).

Corporate core values form the foundation of the values on how the organization
performs work and how it behaves (Chatman, 1991). Musek Lešnik in Malbašić and
Brčić (2012) has discovered the relationship between organizational values as an
invisible concept, and organizational behavior as a visible concept. Individuals have
different beliefs, expectations, and attitudes that are invisible. He presented a values
target (Figure 2), which has five concentric rings, having the core values in the center.

21

Daniel Stenbäck

Figure 2 The Values Target
(Musek Lešnik in Malbašić & Brčić 2012).

The following ring is the beliefs of the employees which is followed by the
expectations. The next ring brings us to the attitudes that ultimately, in addition to the
previous ones, affect our behavior, which is the outermost ring. The behavior is visible
and shown in situations inside and outside the organization. (Musek Lešnik in
Malbašić & Brčić 2012). The importance of the appropriate behavior of the employees
is crucial. Management has provided leadership by defining a brand’s values through
times. However, with the recognition of corporate branding, and therefore the
important role the employees play, they need to be a part of the internal debate about
defining a brand’s values. (Harris & de Chernatorny, 2001).
There is no doubt of the fact that employees act as brand ambassadors and are therefore
a remarkable asset for the company reputation (Hemsely, 1998). The statement of
employees being the source of customer information cannot be highlighted enough.
The perception clients get through the employees needs to be compatible with the
senior managers’ message. (Kennedy, 1977). It is therefore very important to consider
if the employees’ values match with the brand’s desired values. (Harris & de
Chernatony, 2001). Chong (2007) remarks that the synergy between the corporate
values, the effective enactment of these values by employees and their appreciation by
customers is critical to corporate brands’ success.

22

Daniel Stenbäck

Seeking high growth and enhanced individual performance, companies use core values
as a part of a value-based management strategy (Andersson, 1997). The strategy will
help the challenge that corporates face when individuals have different views and
beliefs within an organization (Morgan, 2006). Blanchard and O’Connor (1997)
suggest that value-based management is engaged when managers shape the values of
their employees. This is supported by managers acting as an example of how they are
affected by the core values and how they relate to them. (Blanchard & O’Connor,
1997). Managers must understand the organizational culture and its values since this
could lead to inconsistent behavior and distract the stakeholders’ perceptions of the
brand. It is essential for the managers to agree on the central core values in order to
present congruent perceptions. Managers also need to adapt to the changes that are
made for the values and to the changing circumstances. Management needs to align
the values with the promises and vice versa. The perceptions of core values take time
to evolve. Core values can be seen as a mindset that over time merges the organization
with its brand and customers. (Harris & de Chernatony, 2001).
Begley and Boyd (2000) remark that articulating the core values through human
resource policies leads not only to a value-based culture but to a coherent vision and a
clear direction and decision making. They introduce three key links to value-based
culture:
1. clear articulation of the core values,
2. the influence of the values to a success-driven corporate culture and
3. reflection of the HR policies to the value-based culture.
If these links are not clearly perceived, managers should consider a substantial revision
of the HR policies and the process to impose them. (Bengley & Boyd, 2000).
Core values should generate feelings. The values may lack meaning if they do not
generate feelings (Urde, 2009). Lencioni (2002) builds on this by stating that
executives need to repeat the value message seven times until the employees believe
in it. In other words, they should be constantly promoted, in every chance possible. If
the company hesitates to implement the core values in such a manner, it can poison
the culture of the company. (Lencioni, 2002).
Core values can be drawn in two dimensions in Figure 3 to either “Internally rooted”
or “Externally perceived and appreciated”. The values merge into four types: true,
23

Daniel Stenbäck

aspirational, potential and hollow. The grid gives an overview of the standing of the
core values and promises. The true core values are perceived and appreciated by the
customers over time and internally rooted in the organization. True core values are
perceived as credible and defining for the corporation by the clients. A true core value
must be protected, proven constantly, and never be taken for granted. (Urde, 2009).
Aspirational core values are a part of the value foundation and rooted in the
organization and in the employees’ hearts, however not in the mindset of the clients.
The aspirational values play a visible part inside the organization but lack external
recognition. When launching new values, they start with being aspirational and
evolving with time if communicated and promoted well. (Urde, 2009). According to
Lencioni (2002), aspirational values are those that currently lack success but needs to
be present in the future. An example of this kind of situation is when a company needs
to meet the requirements of a changing market or industry or when developing a new
strategy. It is important to be careful with aspirational values, ensuring they do not
fade the core.

Figure 3 The core value grid
(Urde, 2009).

24

Daniel Stenbäck

As the matrix shows, potential core values stand high in the external dimension, yet
has a low score in the internal dimension. These values are appreciated by and in the
heart of the clients. Nevertheless, they are not identified within the organization or as
a part of the corporate brand identity. Thereby, there is a risk for the values being
perceived in a wrong way by the clients if they are not identified internally. At the
same time, potential core values may lack congruent perceptions inside the
organization. (Urde, 2009)
Core values that are neither part of the corporate brand identity or appreciated by the
clients is hollow core values. These values float around and have no real substance
which puts the credibility of the corporation’s reputation at stake. Values that fall into
this category need some serious effort to evolve them become true. Hollow values
should be the first ones to be taken action to, otherwise, the corporate brand promise
will only stay as a slogan. Hollow values should be wedded out since they lack
substance and significance both internally and externally. (Urde, 2009).
No decision should be taken lightly concerning core values, as there is always a chance
of eliminating a crucial one. Corporates need to look closely at the purpose and
possible future position of these values. They should be discarded if they are found to
lack significant support. (Urde, 2009). According to Lencioni (2002), many companies
have meaningless, toothless, and plain dishonest value statements.
Lencioni (2002) introduces additionally two value categories: permission-to-play
values and accidental values. Permission-to-play values only reflect the minimum
standards of behavior and social expectations of any employee. They never actually
distinguish a company from its competitors, and they are usually similar among
companies, especially those operating in the same region or sector. Accidental values
are born spontaneously without being incubated by leadership and they remain over
time. They often reflect the congruent interests or personalities of the employees and
they have a positive effect when they might create an atmosphere of inclusivity. On
the other hand, they might have a negative effect if preventing new opportunities.
(Lencioni, 2002).
The ultimate task for companies is to build true core values. There is a challenge in
building true core values from a management perspective. (Urde, 2009). This thesis

25

Daniel Stenbäck

will focus on the internal aspects of the matrix and it will suggest further research to
investigate the perceptions of the clients and other external stakeholders.

2.4.1. Shared values
It is out of the question that people perceive things in more similar ways when they
have shared values. Companies having known and explicit values shared by the
employees tend to be successful. As previously stated by Harris and de Chernatony
(2011) the values of the managers shape the perceptions and interpretations of an
organization, hence they might vary from the beginning. According to Urde (2009),
organizations cannot own core values unless it is shared ownership with the customers,
employees, and other stakeholders. Most importantly, the values need to be respected,
believed in and adhered to. Shared values inside an organization give a guideline for
the desired behavior. (Urde, 2009). Schein (2002, p.26) mentions social validation,
meaning that beliefs and values are acknowledged only by the shared social
experiences of a group. Those employees who are not willing to accept the beliefs and
values run the risk of being left out of the group. (Schein, 2002)
If the shared values in an organization do not match the values of the individual, there
can be conflicts resulting in wrong perceptions of the client. Thereby, the individuals
in a company need to genuinely agree with the values and act according to them. Harris
and de Chernatony (2001) support this notion by saying that the brand performance is
better when the congruence increases between the personal values of the employees
and the organizational values. They continue by stating that the performance of the
brand increases when there is a bigger congruence between the values of the brand and
the personal values of the employees and the personal values of the brand team.
Superior brand performance and positive associations are achieved when shared
organizational values are strong, appropriate and adaptive. (Harris & de Chernatony,
2001).

26

2.4.2. Core value behavior
The core values are established and promoted to encourage changes in behavior. Core
value behavior supports the desired brand positioning and corporate culture. Core
values should resonate with the value foundation of the employees and constantly
explain their relevance and importance for the company. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen
2011). It could be said, that the notion “core value behavior” describes well the
behavior of the employees when it can be linked to the core values. Hence, the notion
is rarely used in the literature and it could be considered as a theoretical gap.
Change in corporate values does not occur without motivation for change. Employees
should be motivated towards the core values and behave according to the new message
the corporate wants to generate. The motivation might be generated in many ways.
One way is to engage in the core values in order to gain respect from a supervisor.
(Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen 2011). It could be said, that the greatest factor that
motivates the employees is that they truly understand and respect the core values that
lead to “living the values”. Employees’ attitudes towards the core values may differ
and some might even be reluctant and skeptical about them. The personal values of the
employees’ do affect their attitudes towards the core values. The closer the values are,
the more positive will the attitude be. Eventually, core values and the established
values held by employees will not be exactly congruent. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen
2011). Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple Computer, Inc. once pointed out:
“The only thing that works is management by values. Find people who are competent
and bright, but more importantly, people who care exactly about the same thing you
care about”.
Thorbjørnsen and Supphellen (2011) advocate that there is evidence for the influence
of role models in the workplace motivating employees to behave according to the core
values. Employees establish their ideal self-concepts by imitating superiors and
reinforce their beliefs in satisfying hopes and aspirations. Systems, procedures, and the
structure of the organization may influence core value behavior. For instance, reward
systems and customer relationship systems and other formal procedures such as
training of employees may support the motivation of the employees. This kind of

27

Daniel Stenbäck

procedural and structural support may also suppress the behavior toward the core
values. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen 2011)
Employees having high satisfaction in their work roles performs well in their work and
experience bigger congruence between organizational demands, positions in the
hierarchy, and self-concept (collection of beliefs about oneself). Having this said,
employees are more likely to be motivated to adhere to stated core values and be more
promotion-focused compared to those under conditions of low role satisfaction.
Satisfied employees have naturally greater attention to future goals, aspirations, and
hopes, which usually include promotion possibilities. Employees pay more attention
to this situation to the behavior of superiors, which are in a central position in
promotion success. On the other hand, employees with low satisfaction on their role
will be less motivated to engage in core value behavior beyond what comes naturally
from their own value framework. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen 2011)
Managers should actively search for different solutions to involve less satisfied
employees so that they would not become passive and skeptical spectators to core
value behavior initiatives. By actively forming and enhancing links between stated
core value and work-related behaviors, attitudes towards corporate values could be
strengthened. Managers should examine their routines and patterns of action
individually and look for ways to enhance their managerial behavior to better align
behavior and values. According to the findings of Thorbjørnsen and Supphellen
(2011), most satisfied employees are usually more successful and do a better job than
the less satisfied. This group belongs to a large proportion of future managers. Less
motivated employees benefit most of the core value behavior meetings and training
programs. Managers should focus on promoting these events for those employees. Bad
role models can not only damage the attitudes of these employees towards the core
values but also weaken their general belief in core values as a tool for building
corporate brands. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen 2011). Employees play a vital role as
leading stakeholders by carrying the corporate reputation. On the contrary, corporate
reputation influences employees as well (Dortok, 2006). Having this said, core value
behavior influences corporate reputation.

2.5.

Assessing identity through corporate reputation

Corporate reputation contributes to constructing organizational identity (Dhalla,
2007). Favorable corporate reputation is one of the aims of corporate identity
management. The goal is to obtain a positive corporate image among stakeholders. In
the long run, this image may result in acquiring a positive and favorable corporate
reputation. Corporate reputation influences corporate identity management programs
and partly, organizational identity. (Balmer & Wilson, 1998). Corporate reputation
affects the attractiveness of the organization. At a practical level, studying corporate
identity and attractiveness together is important because organizations usually want to
attract talent by creating an appealing employer image while at the same time ensuring
that this image is congruent with the perceptions of the organizational identity of the
employees. (Lievens, Hoye & Anseel, 2007)
According to Kapferer (2008), companies have become very responsive to their
reputation. Reputation takes the whole of the company and it reunifies all the
company’s stakeholders and functions. The corporate brand is constantly present and
recognizable through art funding (KPMG is the main partner of the art museum Amos
Rex in Helsinki), foundations, charities and advertising. The corporate brand speaks
for the company, which signals the presence of the company. Kapferer (2008) explains
that because service is carried out by people, their variability is a risk for the brand.
Corporate reputation has become a major concern for companies. It is a virtue, hard to
achieve yet easy to lose. Employees influence the corporate reputation in a significant
manner and the importance increases every day. It is impossible to have a good
reputation and maintain it without the support of employees. It has become evident,
that the role of employees being companies’ promotors change the perceptions and
behavior of other stakeholders. Employees are seeking the feeling of being proud of
the company they work for and in a need of a feeling of trust for their company.
(Kapferer, 2008)
Reputation is an evaluation of brand identity involving all stakeholders. To attain a
favorable reputation, managers need to work with employees through consistent
communication to make sure they have coherent perceptions of the intended identity.
The identity needs to be understood throughout the organization in order to be
29

Daniel Stenbäck

recognized by external stakeholders. The greater the congruence between the brand
identity elements, the narrower the differences between the identity of the brand and
its reputation and the better will the performance of the brand be. (de Chernatony &
Harris, 2000). Considering that organizational members are generally aware of the
perception the organization generates with external stakeholders, it is crucial for the
organization to manage its interactions with external stakeholders in a way that is
coherent and synergistic with the identity that it formulates internally. (Dhalla, 2007).
Hatch and Schultz (2002) observe that the organizational members are not only
employees but also potential organizational investors, customers and community
members. The more the customers find a company’s identity emotionally appealing,
the more favorable image the consumers have about the organization (Karaosmanoglu
& Melewar, 2006)
According to Dortok (2006), if the company is placed among a good place to work
listing, employees tend to be happier and more efficient. The company will, therefore,
attract more talented employees. High reputation companies focus more on internal
communication and value communication as a strategic function and associate
communication with making a difference in competition and strategies in problemsolving. Dortok (2006) concludes by stating that corporate reputation cannot be
separated from internal communication, which is the basic and critical component of
it.

2.6.

Communication of core values

This chapter includes the internal communication of core values. It will introduce the
key factors of internal communication and employer branding. Both concepts support
the employee commitment and successful management of the core values.
Communication supports the creation and maintaining of corporate identity.

30

Daniel Stenbäck

2.6.1. Internal communication
Internal communication plays a critical part in the construction of organizational
identity. Just as external communication, internal communication plays a crucial role
in transferring appropriate signals to the members of the organization. Communication
provides the connection between the organization, its management and its internal
components. (Dhalla, 2007)
Internal communication affects the stakeholders within a company and has a clear link
to job engagement. Effective communication internally is the result of strong
managerial exertion. Changes in companies need to be communicated effectively. The
communication of the new core values to the employees requires significant effort
from the management. Nevertheless, it takes all employees to build an open culture,
but the organization needs to provide the right tools that inspire the employees’
interconnectivity. (Cowie, 2019)
There is little doubt about the importance of communication while building a corporate
brand. According to Harris and de Chernatony (2001), incongruent perceptions will be
identified and resolved by effective communication. Repeatedly communicated
strategic initiatives create the desired identity of an organization. It creates a vision
among organizational members when being institutionalized, leading to identifying the
nature of the organization. (Dhalla, 2007).
Misunderstandings can be reduced among heterogeneous teams since they are
expected to have more congruent perceptions. Organizations should make sure the
brand team is heterogeneous to be effective. Moreover, employees with stable
membership in the brand team will be able to communicate more frequently and
informally which increases the congruent perceptions. Employees’ own experiences
of the brand and brand advertisements are also affecting their perceptions towards the
brand identity. When all members of the organization recognize the identity of their
brand, they are better able to act in a coherent way, increasing the likelihood of their
actions to promote the desired identity. The communications of the brand should be
coherent in order to be linked to the brand identity. (Harris & de Chernatony, 2001)

31

Daniel Stenbäck

Chong (2007) observes that internal communication in building corporate brands has
received less attention in the literature when compared to the focus on external
communication. According to Kalla (2005), internal communication becomes more
complex when companies grow. The communication should be exchanged directly
from one manager to another and from supervisor to employee. It is therefore
important to focus on the development of knowledge sharing skills among the
managers. The importance of the balance of sources employees receive information
from is also crucial. The information comes from different sources, for instance,
corporate communication, management communication, and various other sources.
(Kalla, 2005)
When employees understand the brand’s identity, they are more likely to act in a
coherent manner that supports the right perceptions of the desired identity. The
importance of the frequency and the nature of communication is essential between the
brand team and the employees. Communication affects perceptual congruity. (Harris
& de Chernatony, 2001).
Vijayalakshmi and Uthayasuriyan (2015) remark that employers should aim to
generate consistency throughout their communication material using the right words
and images. When employees are systematically exposed to the value proposition of
the employer brand, the culture is shaped around the corporate goals that help the
company to accomplish a unique culture focused on operating in its own way
(Backhaus & Tikoo 2004).
Maier (1967) reveals that when the frequency in communication among the team
members is high, they are more likely to gain their perceptions regarding the brand’s
identity and they are more able to appreciate other members’ perceptions. Bidirectional
communication provides the answer to the question if the communication has been
understood accurately or not (Robbins, 1991).
According to Thorbjørnsen and Supphellen (2011), if employees cannot make sense
of the core values or relate to them, they can perceive internal communication
strategies designed to boost core value behavior as empty rhetoric. Core value behavior
is characterized as the degree to which employee behavior is in line with the brands’
strategically specified core values. Harris and de Chernatony (2001) conclude that the
greater the bidirectional communication is between the corporate brand team and the
32

Daniel Stenbäck

employees, the more congruent will their perceptions of the brand be. It is essential to
ensure that the brand team presents a coherent brand identity. The employees perceive
the brand by their own experiences and based on the brand teams’ message. (Harris &
de Chernatony, 2001). Neill (2016) reveals that internal communication promotes
values and ethics among existing and potential employees under the umbrella of
employer branding. Internal communication managers are aware of and embrace the
movement of employer branding.

2.6.2. Employer branding as a form of communication
Recently, employer branding has gained a lot of attention as a particular form of
corporate identity management by creating an image of the organization as a distinct
and attractive employer, both inside and outside the organization. (Ambler & Barrow,
1996; Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004). The aim of employer branding is to develop
employees that are committed to the core values and organizational goals created by
the organization. Internal branding helps to build a workforce that is difficult for other
companies to imitate. (Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004).
According to Backhaus and Tikoo (2004), employer branding reflects a company’s
efforts to promote a clear view of what makes it distinctive and attractive as an
employer, both inside and outside the organization.
In this thesis employer branding is discussed in relation to corporate marketing and
HR activities. Edwards (2009) supports this by explaining employer branding to be an
activity where the fundamentals of marketing are applied to HR activities in relation
to employees. It is extended to an HR environment, where the branded product is seen
as unique and special work experience. Backhaus and Tikoo (2004) point out that
while organizations commonly focus their branding efforts on developing product and
corporate brands, branding can also be used in the area of human resource management
and therefore aimed to differentiate people and firms. Employer branding is used to
assure that current employees are engaged in the organizational culture and strategy.
(Backhaus & Tikoo 2004). Vijayalakshmi and Uthayasuriyan (2015) continue by
explaining that an employer brand indicates the corporate identity to its current and
33

Daniel Stenbäck

prospective employees, headhunters, and other stakeholders who get connected with
the people side of the company. (Vijayalakshmi & Uthayasuriyan 2015). When the
employment experience is clarified and carefully managed, it would support to create
value and influence. The core characteristics are expected to be presented when
clarifying and presenting the employer brand. (Edwards, 2009)
The concept “Employer Brand” is explained by Ambler and Barrow (1996) as “the
functional, economic, and psychological benefits provided by employment, and
identified with the employing company”. The proceeding employee/company
relationship comes with a series of exchanges of mutual benefit and is an essential part
of the company’s total business network. The benefits a product brand offers to
consumers, employer brand equally offers to employees. The employer brand has a
personality and may be positioned in a similar manner as a product brand. Employer
brand users are the employees who benefit from the work experience itself
(functional), financial rewards, and other economic benefits as well as social and other
psychological incomes from the workplace. (Ambler & Barrow 1996). Employer
branding identifies the unique employment experience by including the sum of
tangible and intangible reward features that an organization provides to its employees
(Edwards, 2009). The set of reward features (advantages and benefits for the
employees) is the introduction of core values and the organizational characteristics that
will support to clarify the value proposition of the employer brand. It will naturally
differ what employees experience and enjoy when working for an organization, but
the main idea of employer branding is that it is possible to gather the totality of a
common or shared employment experience. (Ambler & Barrow 1996)
Building an employer brand requires perceptual congruity by the brand team members.
It is considered that there are three key factors affecting perceptual congruity: the
similarity of brand team members, shared values and communication. (Harris & de
Chernatony, 2001)
Communication of employer branding plays a crucial role as communication
campaigns support the identified “offering” from the company by clarifying and
managing the tangible and intangible features. The communication will also support
organizational identity. (Edwards, 2009). The organization’s focus on HRM practices

34

Daniel Stenbäck

such as development programs, compensation and reward systems for employees will
contribute to identity building of the organization (Dhalla, 2007)
Figure 4 from Backhaus and Tikoo (2004) provides a conceptual framework for
grasping employer branding, combining principles of marketing and human resources.
It shows that employer branding creates brand associations and brand loyalty as main
assets. Employer brand associations form the employer image, which in turn affects
the organization’s attractiveness towards potential employees.

Figure 4 Employer branding framework
(Backhaus & Tikoo 2004).

As shown in figure 4 employer branding affects the organizational culture and the
identity of the organization, which in turn contributes to employer brand loyalty.
Organizational culture responses to the employer brand as well as employer brand
loyalty help increase employee productivity. (Backhaus & Tikoo 2004)
Employees’ role in the brand-building process is crucial and managers can extend their
brand potential by trying to reach greater congruence among members of the brand
team and between the team and other employees. (Harris & de Chernatony, 2001). It
is commonly cheaper to keep an existing customer than getting a new one. It could be
said that this rule is equally important when referring to employees. According to
Vijayalakshmi and Uthayasuriyan (2015), the employer brand will improve the loyalty
of the employees towards their employers which will directly influence the work
efficiency and satisfaction. In the meantime, the employee turnover rate will diminish.
(Vijayalakshmi & Uthayasuriyan, 2015)
35

Daniel Stenbäck

The organization needs to be aware of the brand teams’ strengths and weaknesses to
achieve congruent perceptions. It is also said, that organizations need to be careful
when having new members in the brand team taking to account their ability to work
together. (Harris & de Chernatony, 2001)
Foster et al., (2010) argue that there is an inter-relationship between the concepts
corporate branding, employer branding and internal branding. Internal branding and
employer branding need to be lined up to make sure that effective corporate brand
management is achieved. Furthermore, since a corporate brand promise is obtained
from the identity and culture of the organization, the corporate brand values should act
as a guide for both internal branding and employer branding. In theory, connecting
internal branding with employer branding would result in a stronger working
relationship between HR and marketing functions and eventually improve
organizational success and strengthen the corporate brand. (Foster et al., 2010). The
desired outcome of employer branding is employer brand equity. Employer brand
equity refers to the impact of brand recognition on potential and current employees.
(Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004)
Ambler and Barrow (1996) point out that companies with greater employee
individuality focus more on employer branding than the companies operating in the
industrial and manufacturing sector. Employer branding is more visible when high
individual skills and development are crucial, such as in consulting companies like
KPMG. (Ambler & Barrow, 1996). Companies showing support for employees, open
communication, and those which show evidence of fairness as part of their branded
employment experience tend to attract significant identification from employees
(Edwards, 2009). The employer brand provides vital information, such as elements of
the working environment and retaining the employees, that leads to a psychological
relationship being formed between the employer and employee. (Backhaus & Tikoo,
2004). The employer brand’s goal is to distinguish from its competitors and establish
an interrelationship with organizational members. (Balmer, 2012; Foster et al., 2010).
The brand act as a promise between the organization and the clients (and potential
ones). It is therefore important that the promise is understood internally and that
everyone inside the organization is committed to deliver on it. This concerns not only
the customer-facing employees but also the staff in back-office. (Foster et al., 2010).
Customers and other shareholders either accept or rejects the brand agreement. They
36

Daniel Stenbäck

might also be indecisive or adapt to the agreement. (Balmer, 2012). Chong (2007)
remarks that when brand-supporting activities are consistently performed it ensures
that clients get the most personal and memorable experience of the company and its
promise.

3. Methodology
The purpose of this chapter is to present the research methodology and strategy of the
study. It will work as a guide for the research conducted in this thesis. It will also
include the trustworthiness of this study in terms of validity and reliability.
The research data are collected by interviewing the employees of KPMG Finland. The
qualitative research approach is therefore the empirical method in the research. In
addition to the interviews, the collected data include perceptions and attitudes from the
employees in KPMG. The interviewees (10-20 persons) have been selected randomly
from different service lines around Finland.
The case company is one of the biggest companies in the field of audit, tax, legal and
advisory services. As already mentioned in the introduction, KPMG is a “Big 4”
company among three of its rivals (Earnst & Young, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and
PricewaterhouseCoopers). KPMG Finland has over 1400 employees in 22 locations
around Finland. It is a member firm of KPMG International, which is a wide member
firm network in 153 countries around the world. KPMG has acted and refreshed its
global corporate values, and this research will examine more closely how they impact
the corporate identity and how the values are perceived by the employees and
communicated by the brand team.

3.1.

Qualitative research

Case studies are most often conducted by qualitative research methods (Bryman &
Bell, 2007). Qualitative research includes collection of comprehensive data in a natural
and real situation to give meaning to certain issues (Hirsjärvi et al., 1997). Usually,
qualitative data are information represented as words, not numbers (Guthrie, 2010).
The words are the perceptions of the core values gathered from the employees in the
interviews. The information is also gathered from interviewing the brand team’s
desired corporate identity and the desired perceptions of the core values. The reporting
is clear and analytical, and the data are recorded in interviews and generated by the
support of the literature review.

3.2.

Data collection sources

The researcher is responsible for the reliability and validity of available data in the
research (Guthrie, 2010). According to Silverman (2014), it is important to focus on
authenticity rather than the size of the sample in qualitative research. When collecting
data in both qualitative and quantitative research, interviews are the most common
source. (Daymon & Holloway, 2011)
Research is characterized by the sources for the research. The data are collected from
primary and secondary sources. According to Hirsjärvi, Remes and Sajavaara (1997),
the material the researcher collects himself is called primary data. Interviews and
personal reports from participants are usually sources for primary data (Guthrie, 2010).
The primary data are derived from the interviews in this research. The primary data
consist of documentation and recordings of the interviews and are carefully analyzed.
The researcher must apply and adapt the content to suit his research objectives in order
to use secondary sources. These sources should be reviewed critically since they
contain material collected by another researcher for a different aim. (Hirsjärvi et al.,
1997). Secondary data are derived from other’s accounts (Guthrie, 2010). The
secondary data in this research cover a wide range of different academic journals,
38

Daniel Stenbäck

websites, encyclopedias, articles, and other reference books. In this research, both
primary and secondary data are used to attain enough material for the study.

3.3.

Semi-structured interview

The research interviews, one of the most important methods for the collection of
qualitative data, have commonly been used in field studies. (Sandy & Dumay, 2011).
The advantages of interviews are their flexibility and ability to receive insights of the
respondent’s mindset (Daymon & Holloway, 2011). Interviews are the most popular
method of attaining knowledge for qualitative research (Hirsjärvi et al., 1997) and
semi-structure interviews are the most common ones (Alvesson & Deetz, 2000). The
interviews in this study are conducted in a semi-structured manner.
The interviewer should guide and give the direction for the interview, thus give the
respondent time to answer as freely as possible. By doing so, the answers will be as
genuine and accurate as possible. One reason for the popularity of semi-structured
interviews is that they are flexible, accessible, intelligible, and, more importantly, able
to reveal important and often hidden facets of employee and organizational behavior.
(Sandy & Dumay, 2011).
Semi-structured interviews have standard introductions and conclusions that are called
as interview guides. The guides help to compare the information from different
interviews. Semi-structured interviews allow a natural flow in the discussion by
flexibility in the order of the interview questions. In addition, they are looking for
open-ended query questions (“why?”) in order to the interviewer to understand the
interviewee’s views more in-depth and to elicit more elaborate responses. (Guthrie,
2010; Sandy & Dumay, 2011)
Interviews are typically performed individually but group interviews are also possible.
Focus groups are the most common type, which is a technique derived from marketing
and advertising. In this semi-structured technique, the interviewer gathers an
appropriate location and a group of people, where the interviewer asks the group
questions. Usually, focus groups have a non-random composition but should represent
key targets and have a balance in gender and age. In order to attain the name and title
39

Daniel Stenbäck

of group members to identify them in an appendix, a list of attendance can be
circulated. Guthrie, 2010). When cross-checking viewpoints from respondents, it will
help investigate different perceptions from different respondents.
The drawback of interviews is that they require time. The interviewer needs time to
prepare the interview and the interviewee must give his own time to the interview as
well. (Hirsjärvi et al., 1997).
The empirical part of this study is conducted through interviews in a semi-structured
manner. In order to conduct a successful semi-structured interview, the interviewer
should prepare certain topics in advance. The upside of this is the possibility to adapt
the questions while carry out the interview. It supports receiving profound results. One
of the biggest obstacles might be ensuring that all themes are covered in the available
time (Eriksson & Kovalainen, 2008). The interviews held for this study were
conducted in the time frame and all the interviews included every question listed in
the interview guide (see appendix). The interviews followed a semi-structured theme
and the discussions were open and relaxed. The questions were mainly asked in the
same sequence, but some exceptions were made in order to have a natural flow in the
discussion.

3.4.

Sampling

The interviewees in the research are brand managers (interviewed as a focus group),
employees in generation Y (millennials), and partner- level workers (baby boomers).
The first interview included five questions to the brand team. The interview of the
brand team was conducted as a semi-structured interview of two brand managers.
The interview guide includes questions regarding the corporate identity, core values
and internal communication of KPMG. The interviews reveal thoughts and perceptions
of the millennials and baby boomers working in different service lines (audit, tax &
legal and advisory) in KPMG. The interviewees are listed in the table 1 by generation
and service line.

Table 1 List of the interviewees

The research findings are analyzed with qualitative data. As mentioned in the
introduction of this thesis, the interviewees are from two different generations:
millennials and baby boomers. The reason for this is to attain valuable information if
the younger employees have different and incongruent perceptions of the corporate
values compared to the elder ones. It has been found in a previous research that baby
boomers tend to least likely cite the corporate values (Chakraverty, 2018)
The interviews were conducted in spring 2020. Spring is commonly a busy season for
employees in an audit company. Thus, reaching the interviewees did not cause
problems for the researcher. There was more trust towards the interviewer, since I had
a common background with the respondents. The interviews were scheduled by phone
calls and all interviews were conducted in Microsoft Teams. The reason for not having
face-to-face interviews was the ongoing Coronavirus regulations.
41

3.5.

Qualitative Content analysis

There are several approaches for analyzing qualitative data. Content analysis is used
in many studies and it has a long history. The data are presented with content analysis
and by discussion of the material in relation to earlier research and to the theory in this
thesis. Qualitative data used for doing qualitative content analysis can be texts from
interviews and meetings, or audiovisual data from video recordings. One aim of
qualitative content analysis is to gather a holistic and factual description, which
represents the larger view about the phenomenon under study. The second aim is to
gain a detailed and rich interpretation of the contextual meaning of the data. (Eriksson
& Kovalainen, 2016)
The researcher relies on memo writing and recordings in order to interpret the data.
The procedure reveals the role of the researcher as a subjective and self-reflective
interpreter of the data. (Eriksson & Kovalainen, 2016).
Each interview was followed by an immediate translation of its recording. Ultimately,
after finishing all interviews, the data were classified to different themes. The themes
are corporate identity, perception of core values, core value behavior and
communication of the core values. They refer to the key elements of the theory in this
master’s thesis. The main aim of clustering the data was to find the crucial issues of
the study. After clustering and analyzing the raw data, responses were examined
multiple times, to detect novel findings. The researcher replayed the recordings in
order to grasp on all the data.

3.6.

Validity and Reliability

When determining and evaluating the authenticity and trustworthiness of a research,
validity and reliability are regarded as two standard concepts. The concepts measure
the quality of the research. (Daymon & Holloway, 2011).

42

Daniel Stenbäck

Validity ensures the results accuracy and if the research successfully measures what it
was initially aiming for (Daymon & Holloway, 2011). For this reason, validity is found
as an important principle for analyzing qualitative research (Daymon & Holloway,
2011).
The term validity can be further distinguished in internal and external validity
(Daymon & Holloway, 2011). Internal validity refers to the interrelationship between
the issue of the study and the respondent’s social environment (Daymon & Holloway,
2011).
External validity aims for generalizing the results in such a manner that those could be
used in different discourses as well as for a more advanced research (Daymon &
Holloway, 2011). KPMG had a change in corporate values and that is why they fitted
in the research focus.
Assessing the validity of the research at hand offers reason to believe that previous
research is only endorsing the finding of this study in a limited way. Nevertheless,
multiple similarities can be drawn to support the findings of this research and,
therefore, enable the triangulation of data.
Member checking was done to some extent during the interviews. The researcher made
sure he had understood the answers correctly and translated the answers in the right
words. Data saturation was achieved in the research. Data saturation reveals the point
in the study when no new information is found in analyzing the data. Saturation
explains that the researcher can be confident that further collection of data will yield
similar findings and help to establish emerging conclusions. (Faulkner & Trotter,
2017)
Reliability points out the trustworthiness of research. The interview guide must not
include bias and the questions can be asked by anyone. (Bryman & Bell, 2007).
Interviews are a useful way for researchers to learn about others, yet real understanding
may sometimes be elusive. The interviewer and the respondent might even speak the
same language, but their words may have a completely different meaning. (Sandy &
Dumay, 2011). However, as the interviewer works in the same workplace as the
interviewees, they have a shared organizational culture. This strengthens the reliability
of the research since the interviewer can interpret the cultural factors in a congruent
context.
43

Daniel Stenbäck

The researcher has a prior relation with the case company and several of the
interviewees which is valuable to keep in mind when assessing this study’s reliability.
Nevertheless, the researcher had no personal relationships with the interviewees or
previous experience of the subject, which could have created a wider hypothesis about
the topic.

4. Empirical findings
The core values of KPMG are introduced in the Figure 5. They represent what KPMG
is and what the company believes in. “Everything we do is underpinned by a shared
set of values that define how we work together, with our clients and communities. Our
Values are our core beliefs, guiding and unifying our actions and behaviors. We were
one of the first professional services organizations to define a global set of Values and
they have remained core to our culture and who we are ever since.” (KPMG, 2020).
The old values are listed as short sentences and the refreshed ones are explained by
one word. The reason for this was to make the value statement simpler.

Figure 5 KPMG core values
(KPMG, 2020).

The definitions of the refreshed core values are listed below as they are stated in the
company website. The aim for listing the definitions is to give the reader a better
understanding of the values.
Bengley and Boyd (2000) reveals that the amount of core values is recommended to
be three to six. The previous seven core values have been refreshed, resulting in five
core values: integrity, excellence, courage, together and for better.
Integrity is explained in KPMG’s intranet as following: “Integrity means we are
honest, fair and consistent in our words, actions and decisions – both inside and
outside work. We take responsibility and accountability for our day-to-day behavior
45

Daniel Stenbäck

and we hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards at all times – even
when under pressure. We keep our promises and set an example for others to follow.”
“Excellence means relentlessly delivering quality work to the highest professional
standards. We do this by staying curious and taking personal responsibility for our
learning. We constantly look to improve our work through data and insight, and are
open to new challenges and feedback because that is how we develop and improve”
“Courage is about being open to new ideas and being honest about the limits of our
own knowledge and experience. It’s about applying professional skepticism to what
we see and asking questions where we have doubts. We speak up if we see something
we believe is wrong and we support those who have the courage to speak up
themselves. Courage is being bold enough to step outside of your comfort zone, to do
what is right and meaningful for all our stakeholders.”
“We do our best work when we do it together: in teams, across teams, and by working
with others outside our organization. Working together is important because we know
it is collaboration that shapes opinions and drives creativity. We embrace people with
diverse backgrounds, skills, perspectives and life experiences and ensure different
voices are heard. We show care and consideration for others and strive to create an
inclusive environment where everyone feels they belong”
“For better means taking a long-term view, even in our day-to-day choices, because
we want to build a stronger KPMG for future. We never lose sight of the importance
of our role in building trust in the capital markets and in business. We make
sustainable, positive change in our local communities and in society at large, striving
to make the world a better place”.

4.1.

Interview of the brand team

The empirical part of this study began with an interview of the brand team. The aim
of the interview was to gain knowledge about the desired core value behavior,
corporate culture and corporate identity. The interview examined an internal view of
how the core values are integrated into the company operations and how they are
46

Daniel Stenbäck

communicated to the employees. At the time of this interview, the refreshed values
had yet to be integrated into all the company operations, since they had been launched
one week before the interview. The answers reflect hereby partly the old values.
Lencioni (2002) and Franz (2019) reveal that core values should be integrated into
every employee-related situation in order to be truly integrated into the organization.
According to the brand team, the values are integrated into the daily duties and
decision making. Working together is a highly visible value and it shows every day.
Employees work naturally in teams with integrity, which is also one of the core values.
The core values can be seen in the client documents, such as marketing materials and
offers and in internal documents such as risk management communication and CEO
letters, says the brand managers.
“It is important that every employee thinks about the values referring to their own
work and what they mean to the employee and how the values are present in their job”.
According to the brand team, the top management is committed to the core values. The
communication from the top management is done systematically according to the core
values. Lencioni (2002) points out that companies need to include core values in their
HR activities, to everything from hiring methods to promotions and rewards, from the
first interview to the last day of work. The brand team explains that the values are
integrated into the HR activities in KPMG. All new employees must participate in a
“welcome to KPMG” day, where they are introduced to the core values, strategy and
vision. During the day, several discussions and assignments are held about the values.
Basic topics in the discussions are what the values mean to the employee and which
one is the most important one for oneself. The KPMG story is also presented during
the day (see KPMG, 2016).
The brand team mentions that the KPMG story reveals what the company stands for
and what the company strives to be. The company´s promise for the customers is also
included in the story. The story of KPMG answers the following questions: why we
are here? what do we believe in? what do we want to be? how do we get there? how
do we want the world to see us? The purpose of the story is that when KPMG unifies
behind its story it performs at its best.

47

Daniel Stenbäck

The brand managers explain that the employees are part of a performance development
program. In the program, the individual goals are set, and it communicates the desired
core value behavior in cooperation with the performance manager (supervisor).
“The fundamental base of the program is an ongoing discussion and feedback giving
regarding the goals and to make sure they are clear and that the number of goals is
small enough.”
The employees are on a certain level of the hierarchy. The career path training guides
and supports the employees achieve a higher position. In addition to measuring
numbers and customer satisfaction, the career path training also measures the core
value behavior of the employee. A score is given after viewing all the factors. The
score is better when an employee has been behaving according to the core values. The
brand managers reveal that if the employee fails to behave according to the core values,
for example, does not share information (which is against the together value) the
supervisor will have a discussion with the employee and it will affect the score
negatively. According to the brand team, the training is a part of a culture of discussion
and of giving continuous feedback.
As Chong (2007) mentions in the literature review, it is worthless to hope that the
employees simply “live” the written values, without communicating them correctly.
The importance of how the clients appreciate them over time plays a crucial role.
Selected members of the brand team integrated the new values in the communication
materials. The aim of the external communication is to be “the clear choice” for the
customers supported by all the employees. The brand managers remark that the
communication of the values needs to be done through various channels such as in
emails, messages in the intranet, internal materials and in meetings. A brand manager
explains: “It does not help if the values are just listed on the company website with a
flourish”. The brand manager used the Finnish word: korulause.
Gioia (1998) states that corporate identity is what employees consider to be central to
the organization and what distinguishes the organization from others. The brand team
describes that the KPMG story forms the corporate identity (KPMG, 2016). “It is
difficult to explain with a few words. Instead, it is easy to explain it through the
corporate values and vision”. According to the brand team, the identity is recognizable
in other countries as well and it is coherent across borders.
48

Daniel Stenbäck

It is important to study if the employees’ values match with the brand’s desired values
(Harris & de Chernatony, 2001). The brand managers reveal that when the personal
values of an employee are coherent with the values of KPMG, the employee tends to
be satisfied to work for KPMG and remain with the company. According to the brand
managers, it is challenging and stressful to work in a company that has dissimilar
values than its own values. “I believe that our employees would not have applied for
KPMG if their values would conflict with the values of the company”.
It is unnecessary to remind the employees of the values because everything KPMG
does is done according to the core values. The brand managers point out that if you
need to remind the employees of the core values, they have yet to be thoroughly
integrated into the company´s operations.

4.2.

Interviews of the millennials and baby boomers

This chapter includes the findings from the interviews with the millennials and baby
boomers and a summary of how they correlate with each other. The baby boomers
refer to the more experienced employees and the millennials are the younger
employees. The findings are divided in to the key themes: corporate identity,
perceptions of the core values, core value behavior and communication of the core
values.

4.2.1. Corporate identity
Millennials: The overall feeling the millennials have for KPMG is positive. The
respondents feel that KPMG is a loyal employer with many talented professionals.
“KPMG is a fair employer that takes care of us employees”. According to millennials,
the atmosphere in the workplace is good.
“The working environment is casual and upfront. If I would be the customer, I would
rather work with KPMG compared to other Big 4 companies”.
49

Daniel Stenbäck

“I work with many other millennials, which creates a good working environment”.
As KPMG is an international company with over 200 000 employees worldwide, it
generates positive associations among the millennials. They perceive the organization
to be open and reliable. The organizational identity is described by the millennials as
following:
“Big, international organization with great career opportunities and talented people
who are always eager to help”.
“We are a big team that brings opportunities to learn from many other people”.
“Big, international company with a great network. The mass brings strength”.
Baby boomers: As already mentioned, the baby boomers in KPMG are mostly
partners. That means they own shares of KPMG Finland. All the baby boomers in the
study were partners from different service lines (audit, advisory and tax & legal).
One of the partners observes that the corporate identity has changed during the last
few decades. It has evolved from being an audit firm to a multidisciplinary expert
organization. “We are nowadays a broad branched advisory community, that exists to
help the clients’ problems”.
According to several partners, KPMG is a friendly audit firm that respects the
individual and the decisions are not made in a hurry. “Respect the individual” is one
of the old values of KPMG. “Even though the current Corona virus-situation is upon
us, we don’t have to be scared to lose our jobs”. Several respondents reveal that the
organizational hierarchy is low. “We don´t have a hierarchy. We don’t have a “sir”
culture”.
“We have a low hierarchy with a tolerance of failure. Even in the hard times, the firm
takes care of us”.
A partner reveals that in order to avoid offending anyone, KPMG does not have an
identity, but the individual and hard work is highly respected. The partner explains that
KPMG must be careful and avoid building a strong identity and value statement since
otherwise, it might insult some people.
The partners observe that KPMG is an organization filled with strong and deep
knowledge. A few partners observe that the firm is conservative and rule-abiding,
50

Daniel Stenbäck

which refers to the value “integrity”. “We consider deeply before we act, which is at
the same time a slow, but a safe way of doing things”. According to the baby boomers,
the firm is human-centric as an employer. “The organization cares genuinely about us
and supports our well-being”.
“Everyone of us knows very much of our own field”.
“Our goal is to be the employer of choice, which creates the core of our identity”.
“The legislation forms partly our identity, meaning that we have to be an independent
firm. We are a trustworthy employer and partner”.
The perceived corporate identity of all the respondents follows a congruent path. The
millennials and baby boomers feel that KPMG is a human-centric organization with a
lot of knowledge. The millennials feel they are in an environment that courage them
to learn. Having this said, the value “excellence” is visible in the corporate culture,
since it refers to high professional standards and constant learning and improving. The
baby boomers perceive the organization as conservative in its actions and the
millennials think in a similar way by observing that changes are made carefully. Being
conservative is perceived as a positive thing since it generates a feeling of trust and
security.

4.2.2. Perceptions of the core values
Millennials: The millennials struggle to list the core values of KPMG. They can barely
list any of the values. One of the millennials can mention two of the values: “integrity”
and “together”. It can be said that without a proper launching campaign, the values
might not be familiar to the millennials. The millennials observe that:
“The most important thing is not to know what the values are, but how you act”.
“Many of the values seems just like listed words, but you strive to work according to
them”.
The millennials understand and believe in the values in general. They feel that they
can make use of the core values in their work. One of the respondent's remarks that
51

Daniel Stenbäck

internal cooperation works well. The value “together” seems as the most common
value millennials can “live” up to, even though some respondents argue that the teams
are occasionally working in “silos”, that can be explained as: working in small teams
and not using the full potential of the firm in order to maximize the utilization rate of
the team.
The value “courage” is harder for the millennials to understand. They perceive the
value as having the courage to try new ways of doing things, challenge the customer,
and having the courage to say no.
One of the respondents observes that they work together regardless of the title and
position in the firm. The “together” value is defined by that the firm embraces people
with diverse backgrounds, skills, perspectives, and life experiences and ensure
different voices are heard.
After showing the core values and their meanings to the millennials, they understand
them well and can attach most of them to a real-life context.
“We need to have the courage to bring our own genuine opinions for the customer”.
“Everything we do is made with integrity and excellence”. Another respondent
observes that: “Even though we do a great job the result cannot always be brilliant,
but it is always at least good enough”.
The value “for better” is commonly understood as making a positive impact on
something. The millennials have understood the value as desired, which is described
as making sustainable, positive change in local communities and in society, striving to
make the world a better place.
“The value “for better” is more visible for the customers, as we make their life better”.
“When you live according to the values, they are visible for the outside world as well”.
More actions could be done in order to make the value “for better” stronger, as one
millennial states: “The value “for better” would be stronger if KPMG increased the
charity work and other pro bono activities”.
The millennials emphasize that the values of KPMG are not hollow. Some respondents
would like to have a better understanding of the value “courage”, since they cannot
tell any examples referring to this value.
52

Daniel Stenbäck

Thus, a few of the respondents explain that the old values are easier to understand.
”The refreshed values seem hollower compared to the old ones and I can grasp on the
old ones better since they are listed by sentences”. Some of the respondents argue that
it is easier to remember the new values since they are not as many as the old ones.
The millennials think the number of values is good. One millennial would add a value
referring to equal treatment. Bengley and Boyd (2000) mentioned earlier that the
number of core values is recommended to be three to six. According to the millennials,
the number of values is sufficient, and most of them would not add anything to the list.
One millennial would desire to keep two of the old values: “lead by example” and
“respect the individual”.
Baby boomers: The baby boomers can relate to the core values and feel that they share
their own values with the corporate values, even though they are unable to list the
values by heart. They feel that the values guide all actions in the firm. As one of the
partners observes, the values are like a compass in a ship. “The essential thing is that
you go in the right direction. Achieving completely all the values is not the main
thing”.
The baby boomers observe that the first value “integrity” is the base of everything they
do in their work. They explain that things get done openly and, in a way, that they can
always stand behind their actions. “We do our work in an honest way and we do not
pick our side”.
According to the partners, the work environment in KPMG supports working together.
One of the partners observes that all the projects are made in teams and together with
people from different service lines. They reveal that in order to keep the organization
in function, we need to be able to work with other people and respect each other. The
following quotes from the partners are related to the “together” value:
“It does not matter if the employee works in Turku, Helsinki, or London. The point is
to gather the best team for a certain customer project. No one knows everything”.
“Together, of course! Thus, some people are more eager to work together than others
and it is totally natural”.
“We encourage the quieter people to open up and be part of the team”.

53

Daniel Stenbäck

One of the respondents points out that when the goals are been set, the values should
be more present. “It is important that our goals give us enough space to fully live up
to the values”. As a millennial pointed out, a few partners explain that the teams are
occasionally in silos. “We should work more together outside our own service lines”.
The goal is to provide quality to the customers. According to the respondents, it is
important that excellence in the work is visible both internally and externally. “The set
of values strives to highlight the cooperative culture and everything we do is made
with integrity and excellence. We keep our clients one step ahead”.
“It is essential that we do our very best, always. We never offer rubbish to our clients
nor get claims for our work”.
“Our goal is to exceed clients’ expectations and maintain being the trusted advisor”.
According to some respondents, the time limits in some of the projects can be very
tight. There is a risk that the quality of the work is compromised. Some respondents
state that value excellence is then hard to achieve. Building trust is crucial in customer
relationship management.
According to a respondent, KPMG operates in a sensitive field of business. It is
important to follow the core value behavior to avoid mistakes. Mistakes occur
sometimes and it is crucial to deal with the mistakes fast.
“It takes time to gain trust and it is easy to lose it. Getting it back might even be
impossible. A big four company gets easily to the news. That is why it is important to
offer excellence to our clients”.
The refreshed values were supposed to be simpler. One of the partners observes that
the old ones were easier to understand at a glance and especially the value courage
needs particular focus in the launching process. Lencioni (2002) observes that
executives need to repeat the value message seven times until the employees believe
in it. In other words, the values should be constantly promoted whenever possible.
“There is a risk that the employees understand the value courage in a sense that we
should be adventurous, which is wrong”. According to a partner, the value “courage”
represents our ability to react to our client’s problems and if they are doing something
wrong. Another partner describes that “the clients expect viewpoints form us and we
have to boldly say own opinion”.

The number of values is good, say the partners. “They should not be as many as the
items in the Easter shopping list”. According to a partner, it would be good to unite
the values together and for better.
“The old list of values was simply too long, and the best ones remained to the new list.
It is easier to behave according to the values when they are fewer”.
Some of the partners mention that the old values were described better. Even if the
goal was to make them simpler, the old ones were easier to understand when listed as
sentences. Nevertheless, one of the partners explains that the main point is not how the
values are listed. It is more important the recognize them, especially in one’s work.
“The values have to be recognizable and when we see the values we can say yes, we
have behaved according to them. It is not necessary to learn the values by heart but to
understand the meaning behind them. That is when we have learned the values”.
Only one partner would like to add values to the list. “I would appreciate equal
treatment, sustainability, innovativeness, and curiosity to be added somehow to the
core values”.
There is no significant difference in the answers between the two generations. Neither
the millennials nor the baby boomers can list the core values. They understand the
values similarly, as they are described in the brand material. Both generations feel they
can make use of the core values in their work and they believe in the values. That being
said, KPMG has accomplished a work environment, where the values can be “lived”
up to. This is not usual in companies since Dvorak (2016) remarked that in the United
States only 23 % of the employees of the U.S. strongly agree that they can make use
of the core values in their work every day. Only 27 % strongly believed in the core
values of their organization.
The respondents suggest that the values should be described well in the launching
process since they are listed only by simple words. However, the value “courage”
needs to be explained more in-depth. The respondents are happy with the number of
values and only a couple of respondents would add something to the listing. It came
out clear, that working together is the main value of all the employees and might be
one of the most important assets in the organization.

4.2.3. Core value behavior
Millennials: The millennials feel that the people working for KPMG behave according
to the core values. Core value behavior is recognized especially in the results of the
work and in the daily routines.
Thus, some exceptions are observed in this study. One millennial explains that the
younger employees are afraid to admit if they do not understand something. That kind
of behavior is against the value “courage”, which stands for being honest and bold
enough to ask questions when having doubts. One respondent explains that some
people work more together with someone they are used to working with.
According to a respondent, some millennials feel that they should always be ready to
work over the regular hours. It could be said that the managers are responsible for the
atmosphere among the team and the work load they share. One millennial observes
that: ”Core value behavior shapes the organizational culture”.
One of the millennials explains that in crisis situations such as the ongoing coronavirus
pandemic, it is especially desired to behave according to the core values.
Baby boomers: Generally, the baby boomers feel the employees are behaving
according to the core values. One of the partners find it impossible to behave against
the core values in KPMG, because of the neutral tone of the values.
Nevertheless, some partners reveal there are occasions where exceptions are made in
the behavior, for example, when gathering a team for a project.
“Sometimes, some of us focus only on their own team and oneself in order to optimize
the team's utilization rate. Those choices are not always the best for KPMG nor the
client”.
Another partner describes that: “Not all of us are transparent when it comes to sharing
information of new customer leads”.
They remark that the top management should act to prevent this kind of behavior, even
though it happens quite rarely.

56

Daniel Stenbäck

All the respondents emphasize that the employees behave according to the core values
in general. They can relate to the core values and discover the core values in their own
work and teams. Despite this, both generations find some misbehavior in the
workplace. The misbehavior refers to the values “together” and “excellence”. Some
respondents reveal that these two values are not present in every occasion.
Respondents from both generations explain that people are sometimes working “silos”.
It means they fail to use the full potential of the people in the firm, outside their own
team. This type of behavior is against the “together” value since its characteristics
include working across teams. It could be said, that the current structure of the
organization forbids employees from living up to the “together” value and using its
full potential. It could be said that the full potential would be reached if the employees’
goals would support working across service lines.
The respondents remark that KPMG is leading by its values especially in difficult
times and the core values are easily recognizable in the work environment.

4.2.4. Communication of the core values
Millennials: The millennials state that they can remember few emails and messages
in the intranet from the top management. “The values are mostly communicated in the
intranet and through messages from the top management”. A few millennials recall
that the values have been communicated in team building events and in the welcoming
events for new employees.
The communication of the core values could reach the millennials better by promoting
them more. According to the millennials, the communication of the values could be
more frequent. “When we have a list of values, it is important to remind of them and
of their meaning in order to really understand them”.
“It would be good to insert the values every now and then in the internal
communication messages”.

57

Daniel Stenbäck

According to the millennials, the communication channels that reach them best are
different team meetings, meetings with the whole office and web-based channels, such
as the intranet and information televisions in the office.
“The communication of the values would reach me best through the televisions in our
office and through group meetings”.
“Messages in intranet reach me well and team meetings, because everyone
participates in them”.
“When everybody is home at the moment, I would desire video messages referring to
the values from the top management”.
One of the millennials suggests that KPMG could send a letter home to the employees,
that includes a bookmark with the values on it. “It could even contain examples of core
values behavior”.
Baby boomers: According to several respondents, the communication of the values
should most importantly be done orally, through discussions and exchange of thoughts
and ideas. One partner suggest that the values could be communicated through video
messages from the top management. “The fact that we look at some slides on the
screen does not stick in our mind. Team meetings, trainings and workshops would be
the best way of communicating those values”.
A partner remarks that a Finnish company should have values listed both in Finnish
and English in order to avoid misunderstandings.
As stated by a respondent, it is important to communicate the values in multiple
channels such as in the intranet and in emails and remind of the values after a year to
check if the employees have been behaving according to them.
“The communication of the values reaches me best with personal discussions and
workshops”.
“The value discussion should be held in partner meetings and other team meetings.
Value promise messages could be shared in the intranet and we could have theme
weeks with external speakers of the values”.
It could be said, that the communication and promotion of the core values could be
stronger. The communication channels that reach the respondents best, does not vary
58

Daniel Stenbäck

between the generations. The respondents reveal that the best way to promote and
communicate the values is by discussions in smaller and larger team meetings. Using
various channels in the core value communication is crucial. The importance of core
value related communication in messages in the intranet should not be put aside.

4.2.5. Summary of employees’ perceptions of corporate
identity
This is a summary of the findings from the interviews. The following figure shows
how employees perceive the corporate identity of KPMG. It includes citations from
the baby boomers (BB) on the right, and from the millennials (MN) on the left. The
answers follow a coherent trend, which can be considered as positive. Harris and de
Chernatony (2001) revealed that when all members in the organization recognize the
identity of their brand, they are more likely acting in a coherent way. It will increase
the likelihood of their actions to promote the desired identity. They remind that the
communication should be coherent in order to be attached to the brand identity.

Figure 6 Corporate identity perceived of the respondents

The brand managers revealed that the desired corporate identity is derived from the
KPMG story. (KPMG, 2016). It could be said that the employees’ perceptions of the
59

Daniel Stenbäck

identity are coherent with the desired identity, which means that the communication
have reached the employees successfully. The employees are motivated in working
together with each other and they are relying on the employer and their co-workers.
The millennials feel that they work in a learning environment where it is easy to get
help from the team. The baby boomers feel that the hierarchy is low, which supports
the previous statement and it builds an open and caring atmosphere.

4.2.6. Summary of employees’ perceptions of the core values
Figure 7 shows perceptions and quotes from the employees referring to each core
value. It sums up the perceptions from each generation. It helps the reader to gain a
general understanding of the findings from the interviews referring to the core value
perceptions. The five core values are considered to be a suitable amount of values for
KPMG and the employees can relate to the values by following comments:

Integrity

Excellence

•BB: Our work is independent
•MN: We do things well and with care
•BB: We want to make right things in a right way
•MN: Eventough the job is challenging, we strive for
excellent outcome

Courage

•BB: We have to stand behind our own viewpoint
•MN: We challenge the customer bravely

Together

•BB: We work as "one" KPMG. Nobody needs to chew
on things by oneself.
•MN: We maintain a good work spirit. We learn more
as a big team.

For better

•BB: To make our clients' and their clients' life better
•MN: Create value for our customers. We think and
act according to a general benefit.

Figure 7 Employees’ perceptions of the core values

60

Daniel Stenbäck

Generally, the comments from the employees are coherent with the official
explanations introduced in the beginning of chapter 4. When launching the new core
values, it is important to focus on the parts of the explanations, that are not recognized
by the employees.
It could be said, that the perceptions are congruent thus, they have small distinctions
in the tone. The answers from the baby boomers have a tone of employer perspective,
as they are in the top management and the millennials interpret those by their own
words. The respondents can come up with real life examples mostly to the values:
integrity, excellence and together. The value “courage” is not easily understood and
the value “for better” is linked to external contexts. This thesis focuses on the internal
communication of the values and it could be said that the values “courage” and “for
better” are not yet internally rooted in the organization.

5. Discussion and implications
This final chapter of the thesis reflects the findings to the theory and answers to the
research questions. It includes a discussion of the research, comments from the
researcher and suggestions for further research.

5.1.

Discussion

This thesis has aimed to examine the new core values of KPMG and how they impact
the corporate identity and employee perception. The literature has been a guide for the
research and supporting the study. Based on the literature and the findings from the
interviews, the answers to the research questions of this master’s thesis have been
found.

61

Daniel Stenbäck

RQ1. Theoretical research question: How do corporate values impact corporate
identity?

Every organization has an identity, which reveals the corporate values and presents a
sense of individuality that helps the organization to differentiate from its competitors.
(de Chernatony & Harris 2000). Organizational culture and core values are the
building blocks of corporate identity. Hatch and Schultz (1997) explain corporate
identity as being a commonly shared understanding of the corporate core values and
characteristics.
Core value behavior supports the desired brand positioning and the corporate culture.
Core values should resonate with the value foundation of the employees and constantly
explain their relevance and importance to the company. (Thorbjørnsen & Supphellen
2011). One of the main aims of corporate identity is that it creates a unique
identification of the organization that is recognizable by the employees. (Balmer,
2008). The corporate values define the corporate identity and support the promise of
the brand. The values have the role of guiding the brand-building efforts internally and
externally. The value foundation of a corporate brand is built together with
organizational values, brand core values, and perceived values. (Urde 2009).

RQ2. How do the new corporate values of KPMG affect its corporate identity?

Previous research shows that corporate values form the base of corporate identity.
While evaluating how the new core values affect the corporate identity it was observed
that the old values were like the new values. The findings reveal that the new core
values do not change the corporate identity since the value statement is similar
compared to the old one. Having said this, when refreshing core values, they might
only affect the corporate identity if they were unlike the old values and have a different
value statement.
The core values affect the corporate identity. It is evident, that the culture of working
together with integrity and striving for excellence is formed by the core values. It can
be said, that the core values have a central effect on the firm’s identity.
62

Daniel Stenbäck

RQ3. How are the new values perceived by young vs. more experienced employees?

In this thesis, I researched two different generation’s perception of the core values.
The young employees refer to the millennials and the more experienced employees are
the baby boomers, also discussed as partners in this study. There is no remarkable
difference in the answers between the two generations. The respondents are unfamiliar
with the new core values in this early stage of the launching process. After the values
have been shown to the respondents in the interview, they have given thoughtful
comments to help answer the research question. Figure 7 helps to show the answer to
this question. It has been revealed, that the two generations have congruent perceptions
of the core values. It has been observed, that both generations can relate to the core
values and can make use of them in their work since they can attach the values to reallife and by giving examples of those situations.
According to previous research conducted by Chakraverty (2018) nearly half of the
employees cannot recite the core values. Furthermore, those aged above 45 were least
likely to be able to recite their company’s vision. This study shows that age did not
affect the ability to list the core values. Baby boomers were equally as unable to recite
the core values of KPMG as the millennials.
The number of values is good and only a few respondents would add values that they
appreciate to the listing. The refreshed core values are viewed as challenging to
understand compared to the old ones since they are listed without sentences.
The value “together” is revealed as being central to the core value behavior and
conversely, in the behavior against the core values. This is an important point of view
and actions should be taken in reforming the organizational structure to ensure the core
value behavior is coherent.

RQ4. How can companies ensure a coherent corporate identity when communicating
change in corporate values?

63

Daniel Stenbäck

The research reveals that using multiple channels in core value communication is
crucial in terms of achieving awareness of the new core values. The channels are
suggested to be both digital and verbal and the communication should be repeated
during the year. The importance of communicating the values verbally in team
meetings is observed to be vital. Companies should put much effort into the core value
communication since it guides every decision made in the company. A coherent
corporate identity is achieved when working together in teams, across teams, and by
working with others outside our organization. Companies can ensure that they have a
coherent corporate identity when every employee identifies the core values in their
own work.
Balmer (2001) introduced different identity types in the literature review. He explained
that all the identity types should be in close alignment to be complete. The “Dr.
Balmer’s ACID Test” cannot be measured completely, since the study investigates
only the internal part of the corporate identity. The study reveals, that the actual
identity (internal values, organizational behavior) is aligned with the communicated
identity (the various organizational messages) and the desired identity (the vision as
articulated by the chief executive and management board).
According to Lencioni (2002) and Franz (2019), core values should be integrated into
every employee-related process to be truly integrated into the organization. Even
though the new values are in an early state in the launching process, the brand team
argues that the values are integrated into all the HR processes.
Bengley and Boyd (2000) introduced three key links to value-based culture:
1. clear articulation of the core values,
2. the influence of the values to a success-driven corporate culture and
3. reflection of the HR policies to the value-based culture.
The brand team needs to keep these key links in mind in the communication of the
new core values when being an organization led by its values. Referring to the
respondents, the value “courage” needs to be articulated in a greater focus.
It is important that the employees truly understand and respect the core values. It will
result in “living the values”. The personal values of the employees’ do affect their
attitudes towards core values. It has been discovered in this study that the personal
64

Daniel Stenbäck

values of the employees are coherent with the core values of KPMG. The closer the
values are, the more positive will the attitude be.
When employees understand the brand’s identity, they are more likely to act in a more
coherent manner that supports the right perceptions of the desired identity. This study
shows that the employees understand the corporate identity of KPMG as desired. The
importance of the frequency and the nature of communication is high between the
brand team and the employees. Communication affects perceptual congruity. (Harris
& de Chernatony, 2001). According to the findings of this study, the communication
of the core values could be done more frequently, and the channels could vary to a
larger extent.

5.2.

Suggestions for further research

Core values can be drawn in two dimensions in Figure 3 from Urde (2009) to either
“Internally rooted” or “Externally perceived and appreciated”. The values are
categorized into four types: true, aspirational, potential, and hollow. The grid gives an
overview of the standing of the core values and promises. The researcher suggests for
further research to investigate the external perception and appreciations of the core
values. Answers to the model can be found after researching the perceptions of the
external audiences.
Corporate reputation is part of the corporate identity and it is, therefore, necessary to
investigate how KPMG is perceived from the external perspective. The researcher
suggests studying the perceptions of key clients, external partners, and other
stakeholders in order to arrive at a conclusion of the overall perception of the corporate
identity of the firm. By doing so, the conceived identity (the images/representations,
reputational profile held of the organization by stakeholder groups and networks) is
revealed.
The researcher suggests doing a similar study next year when the launch of the core
values has been done and the refreshed values are internally rooted in the company
operations. It would be valuable to investigate how the findings of this study have
changed during the year and if the perceptions are similar. I suggest investigating if
65

Daniel Stenbäck

the new values affect the corporate identity when rooted in company operations. A
comparison between the findings from this study could be done to reveal if the internal
communication of the values has been effective.
This study has been investigating the internal communication of the corporate values.
The suggestion is to study the external communication of the values in order to achieve
information about the channels, frequency, and audiences of the communication.

5.3.

Acknowledgements

The study has generated unique findings that create value for KPMG Finland. The
study can be generalized and conducted in other companies as well. The values do
not have to be refreshed in order to conduct the study. The researcher is satisfied in
the research process and in the results of the study and is delighted to hand in this
study to the use of the brand team of KPMG.
The researcher highly appreciates the help of the supervisor and is grateful for the
seamless cooperation during this project. I want to also show my humble thanks to
the brand team of KPMG Finland. The team has supported my research with
valuable feedback and guidance. I want to thank all the interviewees participating in
the research and for giving thoughtful and genuine answers to the questions.

6. Svensk sammanfattning
Det kan sägas att flera åtgärder kan vidtas för att hantera och "leva upp" till
kärnvärdena i organisationer. Denna magisteruppsats introducerar företaget KPMG:s
nya kärnvärden och organisationens företagsidentitet. Avhandlingen observerar hur de
nya kärnvärdena påverkar företagets identitet och hur de anställda uppfattar dem.
Tidigare forskning och litteratur har visat att organisationens identitet är i centrum av
dess framgång. Identiteten i organisationen kan byggas upp och utvecklas strategiskt
66

Daniel Stenbäck

för att stöda dess målsättningar och för att leda organisationen till den handling som
ledningen strategiskt önskar.
Med hjälp av kärnvärden kan organisationen skapa en stark identitet som ger möjlighet
till organisationsaktivitet och som framkommer på ett sätt som ger organisationen
möjlighet att uppnå sina organisatoriska mål på bästa sätt (Dhalla, 2007).
När företag försöker förändra eller förbättra sina befintliga värden finns det enligt
Lencioni (2002) en risk att värden blir retoriskt tomma. Om värdemeddelandet blir
tomt, skapas det oklarhet hos personalen och drivs en kil mellan kunder och hotar
ledningens trovärdighet.
Enligt tidigare forskning utförd av Chakraverty (2018) vill 74% av de anställda som
arbetar inom IT-tjänsten i Storbritannien vara mera delaktiga till att bidra till företagets
vision och kärnvärden. Forskningen avslöjar att nästan hälften av de anställda inte kan
räkna upp företagets kärnvärden.
De som är över 45 år är minst troliga att kunna förklara sitt företags vision. Två
fallstudier utförda av Balmer och Wilson (1998) visar att organisationens mål, att
kärnvärdena är klara för alla anställda, kan vara ouppnåeligt. Målet om att ha en
gemensam identitet är svårt att uppnå om alla anställda inte beter sig enligt
värderingarna. Balmer och Wilson (1998) påpekar att företagsidentitet är ett
komplicerat fenomen som är svårt att hantera. de Chernatony och Harris (2000)
påpekar att internaliseringen av kärnvärden är större bland interna intressenter när de
identifierar

sig

med

företagets

varumärke.

Om

varumärkets

kärnvärden

överensstämmer med arbetarnas personliga värderingar kommer varumärkets rykte att
vara bättre. Chakraverty (2018) uppmuntrar företag att tänka om och uppdatera
visionen och värderingarna för att se till att de uppfyller nutida omständigheter.
Denna avhandling undersöker om det finns inkonsekvens i svaren mellan två olika
generationer gällande KPMG:s kärnvärden. Generationerna är babyboomers, födda
mellan åren 1946–1964, och generation y, personer födda mellan åren 1980 och 2000.
Fallbolaget är KPMG Finland som är känt som ett av "Big Four" -företagen.
Organisationen erbjuder tjänster inom revision, skatt, juridiska tjänster och andra
affärsrådgivningstjänster.

Denna

avhandling

studerar

hur

förändringar

i

kärnvärdena

påverkar

organisationsidentiteten och hur de anställda uppfattar dessa. Kärnvärdena är
centrumet för identiteten och förmännens roll är att introducera kärnvärdena och föra
fram meddelandet till anställda för att skapa ett kongruent beteende och kongruenta
värden.
Denna avhandling fokuserar på företagsidentitet som är den interna aspekten av
företagets varumärke. Den förklarar hur intern kommunikation stöder lanseringen av
kärnvärden och hur de introduceras för de anställda. Företagsrykte introduceras kort i
denna avhandling och jag förklarar hur det korrelerar med företagets identitet.
Det kan sägas att det finns för lite bevis på om anställda förstår KPMG:s kärnvärden
på ett önskat sätt, särskilt nu när KPMG nyligen har lanserat sina uppdaterade
kärnvärden. Omfattningen av tidigare forskning om ämnet är liten då man observerar
två olika generationers uppfattningar om arbetsgivarens företagsidentitet och
kärnvärden.
I litteraturen diskuteras det att uppfattningen och implementeringen av kärnvärdena
för ett organisationsvarumärke ofta är otillräcklig och svårfångad. Det är för naivt att
säga att alla anställda har samma värderingar som organisationen har. Numera
förväntar sig många anställda att deras arbetsgivare delar med sig av sina personliga
värden. Det kan ändå konstateras att ju mer de anställda delar och förstår företagens
kärnvärden, desto bättre blir resultaten när det gäller arbetstillfredsställelse,
arbetsengagemang och företagets framgång. Lievens, Hoye och Anseel (2007) menar
att det i tidigare studier har lagts lite uppmärksamhet på det som definierar hur de
anställda uppfattar den organisatoriska identiteten och den tolkade externa bilden av
organisationerna.
I denna avhandling ingår fyra forskningsfrågor. Jag kommer att undersöka dessa frågor
genom att intervjua anställda från KPMG i två olika generationer. Det centrala syftet
med denna undersökning är att observera hur uppdateringen av kärnvärden påverkar
företagets identitet och hur de anställda uppfattar de nya värdena.
1. Teoretisk forskningsfråga: Hur påverkar kärnvärden företagsidentiteten?
2. Empirisk forskningsfråga: Hur påverkas organisationsidentiteten på KPMG av de
nya kärnvärdena?
68

Daniel Stenbäck

3. Empirisk forskningsfråga: Hur uppfattas de nya värdena av unga respektive mer
erfarna anställda?
4. Normativ forskningsfråga: Hur kan företag säkerställa en sammanhängande
företagsidentitet när de kommunicerar förändringar i kärnvärden?
Till följande introduceras teorin som stöder den empiriska delen av denna studie. Den
börjar med att introducera teorins centrala begrepp. Begreppen är hörnstenar i studien
och stöder den genom att ge relevant information om ämnet. Denna avhandling stöds
av flera viktiga definitioner som utgör basen för teorin och litteraturöverblicken.
Definitionerna

är:

Företagsidentitet,

Kärnvärden,

Intern

kommunikation,

Organisationskultur och Arbetsgivarvarumärke. Definitionerna är relevanta och
hjälper till att förstå kärnan i den empiriska delen av avhandlingen.
Varje organisation har en identitet som avslöjar företagets värden och ger en känsla av
individualitet som hjälper organisationen att skilja sig från sina konkurrenter. (de
Chernatony & Harris 2000). Organisationskulturen och kärnvärdena är byggstenarna i
företagets identitet.
Företagsidentiteten behöver stöd från alla intressenter och måste hanteras väl för att
skapa gemensamma åtaganden bland organisationens intressenter. Företagsidentitet
definieras av de Chernatony och Harris (2000) som organisationens mål och
värderingar som skapar en känsla av individualitet som urskiljer varumärket.
Organisationsidentitet är alltså vad organisationens medlemmar anser vara centralt för
organisationen och vad som skiljer organisationen från andra. Den avslöjar vad de
anställda upplever som en fortsatt funktion som kopplar samman den nuvarande
organisationen med tidigare och sannolikt framtida händelser. Precis om individer
bestämmer

också

organisationer

vad

de

är

genom

att

använda

vissa

klassificeringsprinciper och lokaliserar sig sedan inom dessa. (Gioia, 1998).
Organisationskultur är en del av organisationsidentiteten. Enligt Dvorak (2016) är
kommunikation, värderingar, mänskliga resurser, arbetsteam och prestanda bland de
viktigaste drivkrafterna för organisatorisk identitet. De bestämmer hur beslut fattas,
hur anställda beter sig och hur arbetet görs. Chefer kan tillämpa dem för att samordna
anställda med organisationskulturen och vägleda organisationen mot dess önskade
identitet.

69

Daniel Stenbäck

Enligt Schein (1992) kan kultur ses som en plattform för den sociala ordningen som vi
lever i och för de regler vi följer. Kultur grundar sig på våra interaktioner med andra
och formas av våra egna handlingar. Kulturen indikerar stabiliteten och styvheten på
det som man skall förstå, känna och hur man skall bete sig i varje organisation. Kultur
finns inte bara omkring oss utan också i oss. Enligt Griffin (2011) avser kultur
gemensam mening och gemensam förståelse.
Kärnvärden representerar de grundläggande principerna som styr alla företagets
handlingar och funktioner och som bildar företagets kulturella hörnstenar. (Lencioni,
2002). Kärnvärden styr chefer och anställda när de identifierar vilka principer och
beteenden som är de rätta och vilka som är fel. Anställda bör vara involverade i att
bestämma vilka kärnvärden organisationen har. Kommunikationen av värdena är
avgörande för att få dem stanna kvar. (Franz, 2019). I Oxford-ordboken (2013)
definieras värden som: ”principer eller normer för beteende; man bedömer vad som är
viktigt i livet”. Definitionen för ett kärnvärde avslutas därför som: ”En princip eller
övertygelse som en person eller organisation anser vara av central betydelse”.
Rockeach (1973) fortsätter med att betona att värden är grundläggande övertygelser
och oskrivna standarder som ger en riktlinje för bedömningar och beteenden i olika
situationer. Att känna vikten av kärnvärdena i ett företag har en stor inverkan på
organisationens framgång och effektivitet. Syftet med kärnvärden är att skapa en ram
för standarder som bör ligga till grund för hur alla inom organisationen interagerar
med varandra och med kunder.
Värderingar har fungerat genom tiderna som en viktig komponent i organisationer när
det gäller företagets strategi, mission och vision. (Williams, 2002). Värden i en
organisation svarar på de grundläggande frågorna om vilka vi är, hur vi arbetar och
vad som gör oss till de vi är som en organisation. Frågan om "vilka vi är?" är direkt
relaterad till företagsidentitet, vilket är en central aspekt som behandlas i denna
magistersavhandling. (McCracken, 2005).
Till följande kommer jag att presentera den empiriska delen av denna upphandling.
Den kommer att vägleda läsaren in i undersökningen. Data har samlats in genom att
intervjua de anställda. Den empiriska metoden i undersökningen är kvalitativ. I
samband med fallstudier är det vanligaste att använda kvalitativa metoder. (Bryman &
Bell, 2007). Kvalitativ forskning inkluderar insamling av omfattande data i en naturlig

70

och verklig situation för att skapa förståelse för fenomenet. (Hirsjärvi et al., 1997).
Vanligtvis är kvalitativa data sådan information som presenteras i ord, inte som siffror
(Guthrie, 2010).
Förutom intervjuerna kommer jag att delta i workshoppar där KPMG:s
varumärkesteam kommer att brainstorma om hur kärnvärdena kommuniceras. Mina
insamlade data inkluderar uppfattningar och attityder från de anställda vid KPMG.
Intervjuerna kommer att väljas slumpmässigt och från olika nivåer i hierarkin (10–20
personer).
Bolaget i min undersökning är ett av de största företagen inom revision, skatt, juridiska
tjänster och rådgivning. Som redan nämnts i inledningen är KPMG känt som ett ”Big
4” -företag bland tre av sina konkurrenter (Earnst & Young, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
och PricewaterhouseCoopers). KPMG Finland har över 1400 anställda som arbetar
från 22 kontor runt om i Finland. KPMG är medlem i KPMG International som har
medlemsföretag i 153 länder runt om i världen. KPMG har uppdaterat sina globala
kärnvärden och denna avhandling kommer att se närmare på hur de påverkar företagets
identitet, organisationskultur och hur värdena uppfattas av de anställda.
Forskare skall tillämpa innehållet så att det passar deras forskningsmål i användningen
av sekundära källor. Dessa källor bör granskas kritiskt, eftersom de innehåller material
som samlats in av en annan forskare för ett annat syfte. (Hirsjärvi et al., 1997).
Sekundära data kommer från andras konton (Guthrie, 2010). De sekundära data i denna
undersökning täcker ett brett underlag av olika akademiska tidskrifter, webbplatser,
uppslagsverk, artiklar och andra referensböcker. I denna avhandling används både
primära och sekundära data för att få tillräckligt med material för studien.
Till följande visas resultaten från intervjuerna. De intervjuade i forskningen är brand
managers (intervjuade som en fokusgrupp), anställda i generation Y och
partnernivåarbetare (babyboomers). Den första intervjun inkluderade fem frågor till
varumärkesteamet.

Intervjun

med

varumärkesteamet

genomfördes

som

en

semistrukturerad intervju med två brand managers.
Den empiriska delen i denna studie inleddes med en intervju med varumärkesteamet.
Syftet

med

intervjun

var

att

få

kunskap

om

organisationens

önskade

kärnvärdesbeteende, företagskultur och företagsidentitet. Intervjun gav en insyn i hur
kärnvärdena integreras i företagets verksamhet och hur de kommuniceras till de
71

Daniel Stenbäck

anställda. I skrivande stund har de uppdaterade värdena ännu inte integrerats i hela
företagets verksamhet, eftersom de lanserades en vecka efter intervjun. Svaren
återspeglar härmed delvis med de gamla värdena.
Enligt

varumärkesteamet

är

toppledningen

engagerad

i

kärnvärdena.

Kommunikationen från toppledningen sker systematiskt enligt kärnvärdena. Lencioni
(2002) påpekar att företag måste inkludera kärnvärden i sina HR-aktiviteter, i allt från
anställningsmetoder till kampanjer och belöningar, från den första intervjun till den
sista arbetsdagen. Varumärkesteamet förklarar att värdena är integrerade i HRaktiviteterna i KPMG. Alla de nya medarbetarna deltar i en ”välkommen till KPMG”dag, där de blir introducerade till kärnvärdena, strategin och visionen. Under dagen
hålls diskussioner och övningar om värdena. Grundläggande ämnen i diskussionerna
är: Vad betyder värdena för den anställda och vilket värde är det viktigaste för en själv?
”KPMG-story” presenteras också under dagen, vilken som fungerar som en vägledare
för företagsidentiteten.
I intervjun ställs frågor gällande företagsidentitet, kärnvärden och om den interna
kommunikationen i KPMG. Intervjuerna som genomfördes våren 2020 avslöjar tankar
och uppfattningar om generation Y som arbetar i olika avdelningar (revision, skatt och
juridik och övrig rådgivning) vid KPMG.
Den övergripande känslan som generation Y har för KPMG är positiv. Respondenterna
anser att KPMG är en lojal arbetsgivare med många begåvade experter. ”KPMG är en
rättvis arbetsgivare som tar hand om oss anställda”. Enligt generation Y är stämningen
på arbetsplatsen bra.
Generation Y förstår och tror på värdena i allmänhet. De känner att de kan utnyttja
kärnvärdena i sitt arbete. Värdet "together" verkade vara det vanligaste värdet som
generation Y kan "leva" upp till. Efter att jag har visat kärnvärdena och deras betydelse
för respondenterna, förstår de dem väl och kan koppla de flesta av dem i vardagen.
Citaten i denna upphandling är översatta från intervjuerna. Forskaren har översatt dem
själv från finska till svenska.
”Jag tror att kärnvärdebeteendet spelar en stor roll i den interna kommunikationen
och hur vi arbetar med varandra”.
"Allt vi gör är skapat med integritet och spetskompetens".
72

Daniel Stenbäck

Kommunikationen av kärnvärdena kunde nå generation Y bättre. Enligt generation Y
kunde kommunikationen av värdena vara mer frekvent. ”När vi en gång har en lista
med värden är det viktigt att påminna om dem och om deras betydelse för att verkligen
förstå dem”.
Som redan nämnts, arbetar baby boomers på KPMG mestadels på partnernivå. Det
betyder att de äger en andel av KPMG Finland. Alla baby boomers i studien är partners
från olika servicelinjer (revision, skatt och affärsrådgivning).
En av partnerna observerar att företagets identitet har förändrats under de senaste
decennierna. Identiteten har utvecklats från att anses vara ett revisionsföretag till en
tvärvetenskaplig expertorganisation. ”Vi är en rådgivare med bred expertis som finns
till för att lösa kundernas problem”.
Enligt en partner är KPMG ett vänligt revisionsföretag som respekterar individen.
Respektera individen är ett av de gamla värdena för KPMG. ”Vi har en låg hierarki
med en tolerans för misslyckande. Även i de svåra tiderna tar företaget hand om oss”.
Partnerna konstaterar att KPMG är en organisation fylld med stark och djup kunskap.
Företaget är har människan i centrumet. ”Vi alla vet mycket om vårt eget område”.
Det var meningen att de uppdaterade värdena skulle vara enklare. En av partnerna
observerar att de gamla värdena är lättare att förstå och ger en klarare överblick jämfört
med de nya värden och särskilt värdet ”courage” behöver särskild fokus i lanseringen.
”Det finns en risk att de anställda förstår värdet ”courage” i en mening att vi ska vara
äventyrliga, vilket är fel”.
Enligt en partner representerar värdet "courage" företagets förmåga att reagera på
klientens problem och om man ser att klienten håller på att göra ett fel.
Antalet värden är bra, säger en av partnerna. ”De borde inte vara lika många som
artiklarna på handelslistan för påsken”.
Enligt några få svarande bör kommunikationen av värdena främst göras muntligt
genom diskussioner och genom utbyte av tankar och idéer. ”Det faktum att vi tittar på
några bilder på skärmen sticker inte i vårt minne. Gruppmöten, utbildningar och
workshops skulle vara det bästa sättet att kommunicera dessa värden”.

73

Daniel Stenbäck

Det kan sägas att kommunikationen av kärnvärdena kunde vara starkare.
Kommunikationskanalerna som når respondenterna bäst varierar inte mellan
generationerna. Respondenterna avslöjar att det bästa sättet att kommunicera värdena
är genom diskussioner i mindre och större gruppmöten. Det är viktigt att använda olika
kanaler

i

kärnvärdeskommunikationen.

Betydelsen

av

kärnvärdesrelaterad

kommunikation i meddelanden på intranätet är också stor.
Till följande kommer ja att sammanfatta resultaten av den empiriska undersökningen.
Företagsidentiteten anses vara sammanhängande mellan alla respondenter. Generation
y och baby boomers upplever att KPMG är en individcentrerad organisation med
mycket kunskap. Generation y känner att de befinner sig i en lärorik miljö. Baby
boomers anser att organisationen är konservativ i sina handlingar. Generation y tänker
liknande genom att observera att förändringar genomförs försiktigt. Det uppfattas som
en positivt att vara konservativ, eftersom det skapar en känsla av förtroende och
trygghet.
Det finns ingen märkbar skillnad i svaren mellan de två generationerna. Svararna
känner inte till kärnvärdena i detta tidiga skede i lanseringsprocessen. Efter att värdena
har visats för respondenterna i intervjun har de svarat med åtanke på frågorna. Det har
visat sig att de två generationerna har sammanhängande uppfattningar om
kärnvärdena. Det visas att båda generationerna kan relatera till kärnvärdena och kan
använda sig av dem i sitt arbete. Antalet av värden är passlig och bara några
respondenter skulle lägga till värden på listan. De uppdaterade kärnvärdena anses mera
utmanande att förstå jämfört med de gamla, eftersom de är listade endast med enskilda
ord.
Undersökningen visar att användning av flera kanaler i kärnvärdeskommunikation är
avgörande för att uppnå medvetenhet om de nya kärnvärdena. Det föreslås att man
använde både digitala och muntliga kommunikationskanaler och kommunikationen
bör upprepas under året. Det anses som viktigt att kommunicera värden i gruppmöten
och genom meddelanden i intranätet. Enligt resultaten från denna studie kunde
kommunikationen av kärnvärdena vara mera frekvent och användandet av kanaler
mångsidigare.
Forskaren är nöjd med forskningsprocessen samt resultaten och är tillfreds med att
lämna in denna avhandling till användningen av KPMG:s varumärkesteam.
