Nesting behaviour is a form of parental care; nests are often used to ensure the survival
of eggs and offspring and to protect them from environmental threats. Sand goby,
Pomatoschistus minutus, males build nests under any suitable substrate, such as the
shell of a bivalve or a stone, in a soft-bottom littoral area. Nest building is dependent
on many factors including the cost to parents. I studied the impact of wave disturbance
on the nesting behaviour of male sand gobies using wave tanks to simulate different
wave velocities. Treatment tanks were set to velocities between 8 cm/s and 18 cm/s
whilst control tanks had no wave action. A male was placed in each tank for 23 hours
with a choice of a smaller 6 cm x 6 cm tile or a larger 10 cm x 10 cm tile as nesting
sites. Whether a nest was built as well as the choice of nest site was recorded. Although
binomial generalised linear models showed no effect of wave velocity on the nesting
behaviour, males showed more tendency to build a nest in treatment tanks with lower
wave velocities but also more tendency to choose to build a nest at a larger tile in
higher velocities. I postulate that it could be more beneficial for a male to build a nest
at larger site in higher wave disturbances and, therefore, only males that are capable
of building a larger nest will build any nest as a smaller nest is not beneficial enough.
Wave disturbances may have a larger effect on nest building at higher velocities, but
more research is needed.

bobyggebeteende
Bobygge är ett viktigt beteende för många djurarter för att försäkra överlevnaden av
deras ägg och avkomma samt för att skydda dem från miljöhot. Beteende kan trots det
vara en kostnad för föräldrarna eller för deras framtida parningsframgång. Man tror
också att bon kan vara viktiga vid val av partner och man känner till att vissa fiskarter
lägger till ornament i konstruktionen, möjligtvis för att attrahera en partner.
Sandstubben, Pomatoschistus minutus, är en fiskart som är vanlig i Östersjön.
Hanen bygger bo under ett lämpligt substrat såsom ett snäckskal eller en sten och tar
sedan hand om äggen genom att fläkta för att tillföra syre. Dessutom skyddar hanen
äggen från yttre faktorer. Därför är valet av substrat beroende av många faktorer såsom
temperatur, exponering och predatorer. Trots att andra sandstubbar är ett av de
vanligaste hoten mot sandstubbsbon och sandstubbsägg är de inte det enda hotet.
Vågor och havsströmmar kan förorsaka mycket skada på bon och man tror att
boområdet delvis väljs för att skydda från vågexponering. Östersjömodeller har visat
att det kan förekomma större stormsvallvågor i framtiden. Detta kan innebära att
sandstubbar, och andra Östersjöarter, kommer att vara tvungna att anpassa sitt
beteende. Hot av alla slag kan leda till att kostnaden för bobygge ökar och att hanarnas
kondition minskar. Eftersom hanarnas bobygge är viktigt för sandstubbens
reproduktion är det viktigt

att veta hur vågstörningar påverkar denna

beteendeegenskap.
I detta projekt har jag studerat vågors effekt på sandstubbshanens bobygge och
på vilken storleks substrat som väljs för byggandet av boet. Projektet utfördes vid
Skärgårdscentret Korpoström i juni 2020. Fyra vågtankar användes för att simulera
våghastigheterna. Tankarna är 3,0 meter x 0,5 meter i storlek. Två av tankarna
användes för behandlingar och två som kontroll. Behandlingstankarna justerades för
att producera jämna vågor som varierade mellan 8 och 18 centimeter per sekund
(cm/s). I varje tank placerades ett 6 cm x 6 cm och ett 10 cm x 10 cm kakel som
fungerade som substrat för bobygget.
Min hypotes var att hanar i kontrolltankarna skulle bygga flera bon och välja
det större substratet på grund av avsaknad av konkurrens från andra hanar. Jag

förväntade mig att hanarna skulle bygga färre bon i behandlingstankarna och att de
som byggde skulle välja det mindre kaklet eftersom mera energi kan behövas för
byggande i högre exponering. Totalt användes 48 hanar i 48 experiment.
Binomiala generaliserade lineära modeller (eng. generalised linear model)
visade inget samband mellan våghastighet och bobygge, men hanarna hade en större
tendens att överhuvudtaget bygga bo i lägre våghastigheter än i högre. En annan
binominal generaliserad lineär modellanalys visade inget samband mellan
våghastighet och val av kakel. Däremot fanns det en tendens till att sandstubbshanarna
med större sannolikhet valde det större 10 cm x 10 cm kaklet i högre våghastigheter
jämfört med i de lägre hastigheterna. En kovariansanalys visade att bona tenderade att
ha bredare boöppningar i de högre våghastigheterna. En del av resultaten från detta
experiment stämde inte överens med tidigare studier, och detta kan delvis bero på att
vågtankarna är miljöer som orsakar mera stress.
Fastän våghastigheter inte hade någon effekt på sandstubbens beteende vid
bobygge hade hanarna i behandlingarna en större tendens att bygga bo i lägre
våghastigheter. Det här var i enlighet med min hypotes. Samtidigt byggde hanarna i
de högre våghastigheterna med större sannolikhet bo vid det större 10 cm x 10 cm
kakel, vilket inte överensstämde med min hypotes. Detta kan bero på att större
bosubstrat är mera stabila vid högre exponering. Avkomman har också högre
framgång i större bon och det är möjligt att det är mera förmånligt för hanar att bygga
bo under större kakel i högre vågstörningar, även om själva kostnaden för hanen är
högre. Man kan då tänka sig att endast hanar som är kapabla att bygga större bon vid
högre exponering bygger bon, då ett mindre bo inte är tillräckligt fördelaktigt. Att
boöppningarna var bredare i högre våghastigheter kan bero på att det behövs mindre
fläktande för att föra in syre i ett bo med större naturlig ventilation.
Sammanfattningsvis fann jag inte att våghastigheter mellan 8 cm/s och 18 cm/s
är ett signifikant hot mot bobyggebeteende men det fanns trender som visade att högre
hastigheter kan leda till förändringar i beteendet.

1. Introduction
Many species invest in future generations to help with the survival of offspring, despite
costs to the parents and to future mating success (Gross 2005, Pampoulie et al. 2004).
This form of parental investment increases the reproductive success of the parent
(Gross and Sargent 1985). Parental care is thought to have evolved as a result of
immediate fitness benefits that are gained by the survival of current offspring being
favoured before the delayed fitness that is gained through further reproduction (Wade
and Shuster 2002). However, parental care will only be provided if the benefits of the
care to offspring is greater than the cost to the parent (Royle et al. 2012). In mammals
this care usually falls to the female, possibly as a result of the inability to confirm the
paternity of offspring, but in species with external fertilisation, such as some fish, it
might be that the sex that is closer to the egg during fertilisation becomes the caregiver
(Wade and Shuster 2002).
In some taxa, such as mammals and birds, this parental care is invariable in its
vitality for the survival of offspring whereas in other taxa, including fish, the vitality
of parental care is variable (Kölliker et al. 2012). Parental care is more common in
freshwater fish (Gross and Sargent 1985) but when parental care is provided in fish
(20% of families), 50% of families provide male-only parental care, 30% female-only
care and 20% biparental care (Gross 2005).
Female care in fish is correlated with internal fertilisation, whilst male care is
correlated with external fertilisation (Gross and Sargent 1985). This, similarly to
mammals, is due to the genetic relatedness to the offspring (Gross and Sargent 1985).
In species with internal fertilisation, a male cannot confirm the paternity of offspring,
but it is more feasible to confirm the paternity of eggs in species where eggs are
fertilised externally. A male, or female, will not weigh the benefits of parental care
against the costs if there is not a certainty of genetic relatedness. The dominance of
male parental care in fishis hypothesised to have evolved from spawning territories
(Werren et al. 1980) and male care has been seen to be associated with males being
territorial over spawning areas (Gross and Sargent 1985).
Parental care in fish takes various forms. Most forms of parental care can be
provided by either sex, depending on species. The most common form is guarding;
95% of species that provide parental care guard the offspring (Gross and Sargent

1

1985). A guarding parent chases away threats to the eggs or fry, including both
conspecifics and heterospecifics (Blumer 1979). Another form of parental care is
fanning, where the parent fans the egg mass or fry with their body to aerate the area
and remove sediment (Blumer 1979). Some fish species have internal gestation, where
the eggs develop in the ovaries or oviducts and others have brood pouches where the
eggs develop in an external sac on one of the parents (Blumer 1979). Eggs may also
be held in the mouth or gill chamber during development or attached to the body
(Blumer 1979). Eggs and fry may be moved between locations and fry that move away
from the nest or school of fry can be retrieved (Blumer 1979). Some species remove
dead or diseased eggs from the nrest and others clean eggs inside their nesting cavities
in their mouths (Blumer 1979). Some species produce a mucus on their skin to feed
young fry (Blumer 1979). In more shallow waters, some fish species coil around the
offspring to guard them from exposure and low tides, whilst other species splash eggs
that are exposed to the air (Blumer 1979). Whilst some species bury their eggs in
sediment, others build nests (Blumer 1979).
Nest building is a prime example of nesting behaviour (Bendesky et al. 2017,
Barber 2013). Nests are used across many animal taxa (Barber 2013), often to ensure
the survival of eggs or offspring and to protect them from environmental threats
(Pärssinen et al. 2019). In fish, nests are also thought to be an important factor in mate
choice and attraction (Blumer 1979, Barber 2013). Some fish, including sticklebacks,
have been shown to add non-bodily ornaments to the constructions (Schaedelin and
Taborsky 2009), possibly to attract mates. Previously it was thought that nest building
only paid a cost to the males, existing only to further the survival and success of the
offspring. However, a study conducted on sand gobies showed that it is possibly a
sexually selected trait that increases a male’s mating success (Lindström et al. 2006).
The sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas 1770), is a littoral fish and
common along the European Atlantic coast, including the coasts of the Mediterranean,
North Sea and Baltic Sea (Herler et al. 2014). Male sand gobies build nests under any
suitable substrate, such as the shell of a bivalve or a stone, by removing sand from
underneath the substrate (Lindström 1988, Figure 1). In the Baltic Sea, their breeding
season is usually between May and August, the start of which varies locally as it is
dependent on high enough water temperatures (Lindström 1988). The choice of
nesting site is dependent on a multitude of factors such as temperature, exposure to
waves and protection from predators (Lindström 1988). Females will lay eggs in
2

batches in the nest, in a single layer (Lindström and Hellström 1993). Males prefer to
mate with multiple females and females often choose to lay eggs in a nest which
already houses eggs (Lindström et al. 2006; Forsgren et al. 1996). Males care for the
eggs throughout the entire egg phase by protecting the nest from predators and
conspecifics and removing any destroyed eggs or other debris from the nest
(Lindström 1988, Lindström and Hellström 1993). They will also perform fanning,
which increases the oxygen concentration around the eggs (Lindström 1988,
Bjelvenmark and Forsgren 2003). It has previously been shown that male sand gobies
in the northern Baltic Sea prefer larger nest sites (Lindström 1988, Flink and Svensson
2015) and nest size is a determinate in male mating success, as larger nests have more
space for eggs (Lindström 1988). Larger males are often correlated with larger nesting
sites, possibly due to more competition for these preferable sites that larger males are
more adapted for (Lindström 1988).

Figure 1. In nature, the male sand goby builds a nest under a suitable substrate, in this image
a bivalve shell. The female sand goby then lays a batch of eggs in the nest that the male
proceeds to care for (photo Aurora Garcia-Berro).

Conspecifics are one of the most common threats to sand goby nests. In many
nest-defending fish, including the sand goby, larger individuals may take over nests
and resources from smaller males (Lindström 1992, Hamilton 1998). Though nests are
thought to be built to protect eggs from predators (Lindström 1988), male sand gobies
3

do not seem to alter their reproductive behaviour in the proximity of predators. This
includes both predators to males and predators to the eggs (Magnhagen and Forsgren
1991, Lehtonen et al. 2013).
Conspecifics are not the only threat to sand goby nests. Currents and wave
action can cause much damage to nests, as sand gobies often breed on shallow littoral
soft-bottoms where waves often cause major physical disturbance (Figure 2). As a
result of this, sand goby nest sites are possibly chosen to protect the nests and eggs
from wave action. (Lindström 1988).

Figure 2. One of the study sites, Ängsö, from where male sand gobies used for the experiments
were caught. Sand gobies often mate in shallow soft-bottom littoral areas, such as the one seen
in this image (photo Kai Lindström).

Wave action impacting nests is a common occurrence amongst many fish
species. One common risk to nest-building fish in flowing water is losing nests due to
water flow (Rushbrook et al. 2010). Studies on river blennies showed that they orient
their nests in a direction in which the velocity of the current entering the nest is
significantly lower than that of the regular current (Vinyoles et al. 2002). Studies on
the five-spotted wrasse found an association between sea condition and nesting
attempts in that there were more nesting starts in more favourable sea condition
(Raventos 2004). The effects of disturbances of this type have not only been studied
in fish species. A study of burrowing owls has shown that they will lessen their nest

4

defensiveness in harsher wind condition (Fisher et al. 2004); it may be that fish species
react in a similar way. Many fish species have been able to adapt to the present wave
and current climate, but there may be changes to the intensity and frequency of waves
in the future. Models have shown that climate change caused by carbon dioxide
emissions may have an impact on wave climate and conditions (Morim et al. 2019,
Graham et al. 2007). Whilst global models have shown that the average wave height
may decrease by over 25% (Hemer et al. 2013), some models for the Baltic Sea area
have shown that a combination of changes to wind patterns and a rise in sea level can
lead to larger storm surges as well as an increase in wave height (Gräwe and Burchard
2012, IPCC 2019). However, effects of a change in wave climate on fish has not been
the focus of much research in the past.
Threats and stresses typically add to the cost of nesting behaviour and the protection
of nests in sand gobies can lead to a decrease in body condition amongst males
(Lindström and Hellström 1993). It has even been shown that an increase in costs can
lead to a decrease in nesting behaviour, overall, as the costs begin to outweigh the
gains (Rushbrook et al. 2010). As nesting behaviour plays an important role in the
reproduction of sand gobies and the choice of nest is important for the reproductive
success of an individual, it is important to know if change in wave conditions may
impact these behaviours. There are no previous studies regarding these issues and so
this project aims to fill this knowledge gap.
In the laboratory, I studied the impact of physical disturbance caused by
different wave velocities on nesting behaviour. I looked at whether changes in wave
velocities impacted whether a male built a nest as well as if it impacted the choice of
a smaller or larger nest site. Wave tanks were used to simulate different wave
velocities. I hypothesised that males in control tanks without waves should build nests
and should choose the larger nest, as there is no competition. This would be in line
with previous studies. Fewer nests were expected to be built in tanks with waves and
a smaller nesting site should be chosen more often, as more energy could be spent
fighting against the current instead of building a nest at a larger site.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Collection and housing of sand gobies
This project was conducted at the Archipelago Centre Korpoström in June 2020. Sand
goby males used in the project were collected from nearby sites (Fårö and Ängsö)
using a beach seine. The males were collected weekly whilst the experiments were
underway. The sand gobies were housed in 60 litre aquaria between collection and
commencement of the experiment in which that male was used. The housing aquaria
had running water from the sea and the gobies were fed frozen Chironomidae larvae
during this time. Sediment used in the tanks had also been collected from a nearby
site.
2.2 Preparation of wave tanks
Four wave tanks were used for the project (Figure 3). These wave tanks measured 3.0
x 0.5 metres in size and had an adjustable test section for experiments. It was possible
to adjust the pressure, water level (± 0.5 cm) and amplitude of the wave paddles in the
tanks to create a variation of wave types with different characteristics such as
irregularity or regularity of waves, fast or slow wave velocities and high or low wave
frequency. There were wave absorbers in each tank to absorb the previous wave to
keep the chosen characteristics constant. Figure 4 shows the set-up of the tanks in
clearer detail with the wave paddles, test section and wave absorbers marked.
The pressures of the wave mechanics were set at 2 bars in all tanks to secure
continual flow during the entirety of the experiments. The amplitudes of the wave
paddles were adjusted in two of the tanks to create even, regular waves with wave
velocities varying between 8 centimetres per second and 18 centimetres per second
(cm/s) with an average of 11.98 cm/s (sd = 2.70 cm/s). These tanks served as
treatments. The wave mechanics were turned off in the remaining two tanks, which
served as constant controls. Plexiglass was placed on the outer sides of the test section
of treatment tanks with wave disturbance to uphold the evenness of the waves;
plexiglass was not used in the controls. Sand was used as the bottom substrate in the
test section for the experiments and 10 centimetres of sand was used to create an even
base throughout the three metres of the tanks for wave flow. The water levels were set
at 30 centimetres above bottom level. Water for the tanks was collected from the sea

6

and run through a sand filtration. LED lights were set upon each test section to
standardise light conditions and were lit between 04.00 and 22.00 to simulate daylight.
The control and disturbed tanks were placed alternating in case sunlight had an effect.
The choice of which tanks were controls and disturbances were otherwise random.

tank during the experiment and was minimally disturbed.

Figure 4. Schematic drawing of the wave tank. Waves were created at the wave paddles and
moved along the tank towards the test section where the males, as well as the nesting sites,
were placed during the experiment. Waves were absorbed by the wave absorbers to ensure
that the waves only moved in a single direction (adapted from Marin-Diaz et al. (2020)).

2.3 Acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV)
Wave velocities were measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV). Nortek
As’s ADV Vectrino along with the accompanying computer program was used to
measure the wave action. The ADV was placed at 15 cm (± 0.5 cm) from the surface
of the water and was left to measure wave action for three minutes before the
experiment begun. The ADV measured ongoing velocity, amplitude and other factors.
After measurement the data was exported to MATLAB and the rooted mean square of
the horizontal velocity component Urms was calculated. Hereafter, the Urms will be
referred to as wave velocity.
2.4 Experimental design
A 6 cm x 6 cm and a 10 cm x 10 cm white ceramic tile that acted as nesting substrates
were randomly placed in the test section of each wave tank, making sure that neither
tile was sheltering the other from the disturbing waves (Figure 5). The test sections
were adjustable between 0.5 and 1.0 m x 0.5 m but were kept at 0.5 m x 0.5 m for the
purpose of the experiment. The sections were separated from the rest of the tank using
fine mesh netting. After placement of tiles, the wave mechanics were turned on in the
tanks with treatments and the wave velocity was measured using the ADV and
adjusted, if needed.

8

Figure 5. Schematic drawing of the experimental design of the 0.5 m x 0.5 m test section. One
male sand goby was placed in the sand-bottomed test section along with one 10 cm x 10 cm
white ceramic tile and one 6 cm x 6 cm white ceramic tile. The male was left in the test area
for 23 hours.

At the beginning of an experiment, one male sand goby was placed in each
tank. Before placed in a tank each sand goby male was measured for weight and length.
To measure length a digital picture was taken of the fish together with a ruler. Length
(millimetres mm, ± 0.1 mm) was measured in ImageJ. Weight (grams g, ± 0.01 g) was
measured directly on a scale in the laboratory. Gobies varied in size between 34.2 mm
and 67.0 mm with a mean of 47.0 mm (sd = 7.6 mm). Fulton’s conditional factor was
calculated as:
𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑜𝑛 ′ 𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 100 ×

𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 (𝑔)
𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ (𝑐𝑚)3

.

Fulton’s conditional factor shows the relationship between the weight and length of
fish and can be used to estimate the physical condition of an individual fish. The
conditional factors of the gobies varied between 0.33 and 0.98 with a mean of 0.70 (sd
= 0.13). The different-sized males were placed randomly between treatments and
controls, with the mean length in controls being 47.4 mm (sd = 8.2 mm, n = 24) and
the mean length in treatments being 46.6 mm (sd = 7.0 mm, n = 24). A one-way
ANOVA showed that there was no difference in size between control and treatment

9

(F1.46 = 0.488, p = 0.488). There was also no relationship between the order of the
replicate and the size of the goby (F1.46 = 0.119, p = 0.732).
In total, 48 males were used in 48 experiments. Half of these replicates were
controls and the other half treatments. The gobies were left in tanks for 23 hours with
minimal disturbance. After these 23 hours, the nesting behaviour was recorded.
Nesting behaviour included the building of a nest, the choice of nesting site and the
size of the nest entrance. A digital image of the nest entrance was taken, and the width
of the entrance was measured in ImageJ compared to the size of the tile (Figure 6).
Gobies were thereafter removed from the tanks and returned to the sea. Thereafter, the
tanks were emptied of water and refilled with fresh sea water. The tiles were removed
and washed before being used again. Two sets of tiles were used for each tank. This
was to ensure that males were not impacted by previous males’ choices.

Figure 6. The nest entrance was measured in ImageJ. The size of the tile was known and used
for calibration. In ImageJ, I compared the known size of the tile to the widest part of the nest
entrance to measure the width. The width of the tile is marked in black, and the measured
width of the nest entrance is marked in grey.

2.5 Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in RStudio Version 1.2.5001. The relationship
between disturbance and whether a nest was built was tested with a logistic regression
(generalised linear model, family = binomial), using the length of the goby as a
covariate. The relation between disturbance and tile choice was also tested using a
10

binomial generalised linear model with the length of the goby and Fulton’s condition
factor as covariates. This analysis excluded the males that had not built a nest. The
difference in width of the nest entrance between control and disturbance was tested
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), once again using the length of the goby
and Fulton’s condition factor as covariates.

3. Results
3.1 Impact of wave disturbance on nest building
Nest build was measured binomially; either the male sand gobies build a nest, or they
did not. In controls, 45.8% (n = 11) of males built nests while 50% (n = 12) of males
built nests in treatments. Males that built nests were on average 43.5 mm (sd = 5.38
mm, n = 24) and weighed on average 0.613 g (sd= 0.193 g, n = 24). Their Fulton’s
condition factor was on average 0.734 (sd = 0.102, n = 24). A binomial generalised
linear model analysis on all experiments showed no effect of wave velocity on the
building of a nest (p = 0.695, Table 1). However, there was more tendency for males
in lower velocities to build a nest than males in higher disturbances (Figure 7). I also
found that smaller males were more likely to build a nest in both controls and
treatments (p = 0.017*, Table 1) (Figure 8). Fulton’s condition factor had no effect (df
= 44, p = 0.658), but there was a tendency towards males with higher condition factors
being more likely to build a nest.

within treatment tanks, not comparing them to control tanks. There was a slight tendency of

3.2 Impact of wave disturbance on nest choice
Nest choice was analysed binomially amongst the sand gobies that had chosen to build
a nest. In total, 54.5% (n = 12) chose to build a nest in a smaller 6 cm x 6 cm tile nest
site whereas 45.5% (n = 11) chose the larger 10 cm x 10 cm nest site. In treatments,
50% (n = 6) chose the smaller tiles and 50% (n = 6) chose the larger tiles. Males that
chose the smaller tiles were on average 43.27 mm (sd = 7.25 mm, n = 12), weighed
0.605 g (sd = 0.246 g, n = 12) and their Fulton’s conditional factor was on average
0.728 (sd = 0.090, n = 12). Males that chose the larger tiles were on average 44.06 mm
(sd = 2.62 mm, n = 11), weighed 0.635 g (sd = 0.124 g, n = 11) and had an average
Fulton’s conditional factor of 0.742 (sd = 0.120, n = 11). A binomial generalised linear
model analysis showed no effect of wave velocity on a male’s choice of nest size (df
= 19, p = 0.613, Table 2), although males showed slightly more tendency of being
more likely to choose the larger 10 cm x 10 cm tile as a nesting site in a higher wave
disturbance compared to a lower wave velocity (Figure 9). There was no relationship
between the length of the goby and nest choice (df = 19, p = 0.585, Table 2) or the
goby’s Fulton’s conditional factor and nest choice (df = 19, p = 0.975. Table 2).

tendency to more often choose the larger 10 cm x 10 cm tiles in higher disturbances.

3.3 Impact of wave disturbance on nest entrance width
The impact of wave disturbance on the width of the nest entrances in both treatments
and controls was analysed using an ANCOVA. There was a tendency towards there
being wider nest entrances in higher disturbances compared to lower disturbances
(F1.16 = 1.379, p = 0.223, Table 3). There was no relationship between the length of
the goby and the width of the entrance (F1.16 = 1.379, p = 0.508, Table 3) but a tendency

14

towards gobies with lower Fulton’s conditional indices having wider nest entrances
(F1.16 = 1.379, p = 0.205, Table 3).

3.4 Seasonal effects on nesting behaviour
A binomial generalised linear model analysis showed there was a correlation between
the time of season a replicate was run and nest building, with gobies being less likely
to build nests later in the season (df = 46, p = 0.055.). Time of season had no effect on
the choice of a smaller or larger tile (df = 21, p = 0.696) with any tendency towards
gobies in experiments run later in the season being more likely to choose the smaller
6 cm x 6 cm. A linear regression showed that entrance size width was not impacted by
time of season (F1.18 = 0.0384, p = 0.847).

4. Discussion
Although there was no effect of wave velocity on nesting behaviour, male sand gobies
did show more tendency to build a nest in treatment tanks with lower wave
disturbances. However, the gobies in higher disturbances were more likely to choose
to build a nest under the larger 10 cm x 10 cm tile. The former of these results is in
accordance with my prediction that males will build fewer nests in higher disturbances.
I earlier postulated that this might be because the cost of nesting behaviour might be
too high in a higher disturbance. There was no difference between whether a nest was
built in controls versus disturbances and this trend was only found between the
different wave velocities.
Studies on sticklebacks showed that males in poor condition had a smaller
chance of building a nest in flowing water in comparison to a higher chance in still
water (Rushbrook et al. 2010). Sticklebacks also showed less nesting behaviour when
it was energetically too costly, such as when there was less food or when they were
infested by parasites (Rushbrook et al. 2010). Whilst body condition, as measured by
Fulton’s condition factor, did not have an effect on nest building, there was a tendency
towards males with lower body conditions being less likely to build a nest in these
experiments. This may be for a myriad of reasons. Nest guarding is stressful, and the
high amount of energy used can negatively impact the body condition by causing both
weight loss and suppressed growth (Lindström 1992). Studies on the plainfin
midshipman have shown that the constraint of parental care in the form of nesting
behaviour may lower their body condition (Houpt et al. 2020). It may be that males
with lower body conditions were less likely willing to build a nest in the experiment
conditions and might not have built a nest in nature either. This tendency, whilst
existing in all experiments, was more pronounced in tanks with wave disturbances and
it can be that these trends were more pronounced when there was an added stress
factor.
There are multiple ways to measure body condition in fish and Fulton’s
condition factor, whilst frequently used, is only one metric. A study on the bluegill
sunfish found that Fulton’s condition factor is more helpful in predicting lipid density
as well as parasite density (Neff and Cargnelli 2004). It was also found that this
condition factor is in general a good indicator of energy state and individual quality
during breeding seasons (Neff and Cargnelli 2004). It is therefore likely to be a good
16

indicator for body condition of sand gobies in these experiments, but it is also
important to remember that other factors can impact the condition of the males that
may not be as visible or measurable as bodily reserves. More focus on body
condition’s impact on nesting behaviour would be interesting in a future study.
I also hypothesised that males would choose smaller tiles in higher
disturbances to save on the cost of a larger nest requiring more maintenance in a higher
wave velocity. This cost would not only include the building of the nest, but also the
upkeep; fanning and defence have high costs to males (Lindström 1992). Larger nests
are usually more prone to nest takeover from larger conspecifics as they are considered
a more valuable resource (Lindström 1992). I earlier proposed that this would be to
save energy, as the cost of building and keeping a larger nest is higher. Kvarnemo
(1995) found that larger males would build nests under larger substrates and smaller
at smaller sites, as the cost of maintenance of a too large nest in comparison to the size
of the male is higher than the benefit. The results from this project, whilst again not
statistically significant, showed a tendency that went against my hypothesis; gobies in
higher wave velocities often chose larger tiles. There could be multiple reasons for
this, including that larger nest sites, and therewith larger nests, might be more stable
than smaller nests. Three-spined sticklebacks have been shown to use more spiggin
(an adhesive-like glycoprotein used to reinforce the nest) when building their nests in
flowing water than in still water (Rushbrook et al. 2010). This could possibly be to
stabilise the nest more, to the extent that sticklebacks reared in these flowing waters
have higher levels of spiggin gene expression compared to sticklebacks reared in still
water (Seear et al. 2014). The amount of sand that was used to cover the nest was not
checked in this project, which could have revealed if the males built more stable nests
in higher wave disturbances. Another possibility is that a larger nest site is better for
future offspring. Previous studies have found that males with larger nests have a higher
hatching success rate as they have larger clutches (Forsgren 1997). The higher success
rate can be due to an increase in parental investment (Forsgren 1997) and, especially
in sand gobies, this can be seen by a lowered clutch cannibalism in nests with larger
egg areas (Forsgren et al. 1996) and by a higher mating success at larger nests that
may result in more offspring (Lehtonen and Lindström 2004, Lindström et al. 2006).
One could postulate that due to the higher success rate in larger nests it is more
beneficial for males to build a nest at a larger site in higher wave disturbances,
although the cost itself is higher. In this way, only males that are capable of building
17

a larger nest in higher wave velocities will build a nest, as a smaller nest is not
beneficial enough. Whilst it might be possible that the body condition of a male might
affect its capability to build a nest in a higher disturbance, the body condition of male
gobies did not affect the choice of nest site in these experiments. Gobies with lower
body conditions are more likely to lose out on competition for nesting sites, causing
lower reproductive success as females prefer males with larger nest sites (Barber 2002,
Lindström 1988). As there was no competition for nesting site in the wave tanks,
gobies of all body conditions had the possibility to choose either the larger or smaller
nest site.
I found a trend that nest entrances were wider in higher disturbances, possibly
due to the fact that the chosen nest sites were also larger, but also in the smaller nest
sites that were chosen. Nest entrances usually vary in size, and changes are often made
due to changes in the environmental conditions (Lehtonen et al. 2016). Larger nest
entrances enable more ventilation, whilst smaller entrances are better for protecting
eggs from predators (Lehtonen et al. 2016) and are, along with nest elaboration,
positively correlated with mating success (Svensson and Kvarnemo 2005). It could
be that this higher level of ventilation might enable the males to spend less time
fanning, which is a drain of their energy even in non-disturbed environments
(Kvarnemo 1995). This, however, is pure speculation and further research needs to be
done to see if this is the case.
The results from this project did not always coincide with previous studies. My
results showed that only 45.5% of gobies in controls chose the larger 10 cm x 10 cm
tiles as nest sites. Some previous studies have shown that males in non-threatening
environments tend to choose larger nesting sites, independent of the size of the male
(Lindström 1988, Flink and Svensson 2015), whilst other contradictory studies have
shown that this choice of nesting site is reliant on the size of the male (Kvarnemo
1995). My results also showed a significant trend that smaller males were more likely
to build a nest in general, both in controls and in disturbances, whilst it has previously
been thought that larger males were more likely to build a nest. Nest sites play an
important part of male-male competition amongst sand gobies in nature (Magnhagen
and Kvarnemo 1989) and larger males are often more successful in the competition
for high-quality nest sites (Lindström 1992), although the success in male-male
competition is irrelevant to female choice (Forsgren 1997). However, Kvarnemo et al.
(1995) found in an aquarium study that this trend was mostly visible in male-biased
18

treatments and that there was no difference between the size of gobies that did and did
not build nests in a female-biased treatment. The males in this experiment were alone
in their tanks and there was, therefore, no competition for nesting sites, meaning that
the smaller gobies that possibly would not otherwise have had a nesting site due to
competition from larger gobies might have been able to build nests during the
experiments.
Some of these differences from previous studies could be due to the wave tanks
being a more stressful environment for the males in comparison to other aquaria. The
experimental areas of the wave tanks are only 50 cm x 50 cm and the walls surrounding
are metal. Previous studies on animals in wave tanks are few. A study on the effect of
wave disturbances on predator–prey interactions showed that both the predator and
prey changed their swimming pattern in the disturbed tanks in comparison to the
controls (Gabel et al. 2011). That study, however, was performed in tanks with glass
walls in comparison to the metal walls of the tanks in this project, as well as with a
larger test section.
Upon further analysis, there was also a significant trend that the males were
more likely to build a nest in earlier replicates. The experiments were run between the
2nd and 25th of June 2020. Sand gobies in the Baltic Sea have a reproductive season
that usually stems between late May and August, meaning that these experiments were
run through the earlier part of the season. This starting time was later than ideal, as I
had hoped to begin the experiments in May and the late starting time may have affected
the results of the project. Future experiments studying this possible correlation could
be interesting.
For similar projects in the future, it could be interesting to have a larger range
of wave velocities. I could not create a larger range of disturbances in these
experiments, as I had to limit the pressure to 2 bars to maintain even waves for 23
hours that a replicate lasted. This experiment duration was chosen as it has been
commonly used in other sand goby aquaria experiments. However, it would be
interesting to see if these tendencies of less nest building and higher likeliness to
choose a larger nest would become significant in more variable disturbance variations.
Future studies should also include measurements of nest elaboration by measuring the
amount of sand used to cover the tiles. This could probably have been included in this
project as well.

19

Nesting behaviour in fish is easily affected by external forces. Exposure to
endocrine disrupting chemicals has been shown to delay nest building in sand gobies
(Saaristo et al. 2010). The nesting behaviour of many fish species decreases in polluted
areas (Jones and Reynolds 1997) and naked goby males have been shown to abandon
their nests when episodic hypoxia reaches lethal levels (Breitburg et al. 1997). Climate
change has been shown to have affected the nesting behaviour of various animals,
including some species of fish (Mainwaring et al. 2017) and it is thought that these
nesting animals should adapt to the changing climate conditions. Simultaneously,
there are also other factors that affect the breeding habitats of the littoral sand goby.
Drifting algae can cover parts of the bottom and can cause oxygen deficiency as well
as other stressful conditions (Norkko et al. 2000). The impact of a changing wave
velocity is one more stress factor that male sand gobies may experience in the future.
I did not find that wave velocities between 8 cm/s and 18 cm/s had a significant
impact on the nesting behaviour of sand goby males, but there were tendencies that
showed that wave disturbance may lead to changes in nesting behaviour at even higher
velocities.
