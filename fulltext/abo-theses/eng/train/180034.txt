Title: “Because you’re worth it”: A Study of the Labels of Women’s Foundations
Supervisor: Brita Wårvik
Makeup has been around since ancient times; it is something which has been used by
Cleopatra and Elizabeth I and is today used by millions of people around the world. It
appears as if there has always been a desire to alter one’s skin tone. Trends have shifted
from a preference for a lighter skin to the current trend of using self-tanning products
to achieve a sun-kissed look. Today the selection of makeup products is very large.
However, attention has been drawn to problems with the availability of different
makeup products not to mention the labels these products have in particular for women
with a darker skin colour. This thesis examines the labels which cosmetic companies
give their foundations. The aim is to study what kinds of labels are used for different
shades of foundations. The study is carried out by conducting a semantic categorisation
in which the connotations of the most frequently used labels are examined. The interest
is to see if there are any emerging patterns and differences for the labels given to the
products depending on the skin colour of the person the product is aimed for.
The analysis was conducted using material extracted from Google and Sephora.
Twenty cosmetic companies were included in the analysis. Product labels for liquid
foundations, one product per company, were retrieved for analysis. The material was
inserted into an Excel document, which allowed for a thorough analysis. The aim of
the analysis was to examine the most frequently used labels for each of the three shade
categories, meaning for light, medium and dark shades of foundations. Additionally,
the categories along with the modifiers for the labels were examined.
Differences were observed in the labels most frequently associated with the three shade
categories. The light shades of foundations often have labels related to decorative,
valuable and precious objects or materials. The most frequently used labels for
medium shades of foundations are such whose connotations suggest a degree of value;
however, the majority of the labels refer to objects and materials which are considered
to be less valuable compared to light shades. The most frequently used labels for dark
shades of foundations have labels which are associated with the least valuable
substances and objects.
The results of the study suggest that there is a clear difference in how the labels are
targeted towards consumers with light skin compared to those with a darker skin
colour. The labels are more conventionalised for the lighter shades, whereas there is
much more variety in the labels for darker shades. In order to receive a broader picture,
an analysis of even more cosmetic companies, and perhaps also of other types of
cosmetic products, like concealer and powder is needed in order to see if their labels
show similar tendencies.

Introduction

Makeup is a common and rather essential part of the everyday lives and daily routines of
many people. Many women use makeup because of varying, often personal reasons.
Today it is a more widespread and accepted practice, and anyone can use makeup
regardless of gender. A wealth of different makeup products are available on the market
today. One can purchase foundation, powder, and concealer for a base, mascara, eyeliner,
and eyeshadow for the eyes, and lipstick and lipliner for the lips. With such a selection,
surely everyone can find a product to suit their personal taste.
Various different types of foundations are available on the market, typically in either
powdered or liquid form. The present study focuses on liquid foundations, i.e. liquid
substances applied on the skin to create a smooth, even surface and to hide imperfections.
Cosmetic companies often advertise their products in a way that makes one believe that
makeup should be used in order to become the best version of oneself. Interestingly, some
people might even use foundation with the aim of changing their natural skin colour.
Despite the wide range of products to choose from, a lot of attention has lately been drawn
to the way cosmetic companies label their products. More specifically, people feel that
labels for different foundations are inappropriate and loaded with stereotypes. There have
been complaints about not only the labels but also some dissatisfaction with the different
shade options available. The range of available shades tends to differ depending on who
the makeup is aimed for. The range of options for consumers with darker skin tones is
typically far more limited than for those with lighter skin colours. In fact, women with a
darker skin colour have expressed concerns about why the makeup that they buy often
appears to have labels related to coffee, like Mocha or Espresso, and why the makeup
labels for people with a whiter skin colour tend to be words such as Alabaster (Reid,
2018).
Every time I look for a new foundation, I loathe looking at the names of
the darker shade selection (when there is a selection at all). Since I can
remember I have always been a type of frothy coffee, or pudding, or a nut.
(Reid, 2018)

Reid (2018) calls for more equality especially in the labelling of products and the
selection available to women with a darker skin colour. She goes on to state that if
cosmetic companies are going to use labels related to dessert and coffee for their darker
shades, surely the lighter shades of foundation should also be treated the same way?
The aim of this study is to examine what labels cosmetic companies give to their
foundations, and what connotations these labels might ultimately have. The study is
grounded in the fields of sociolinguistics and semantics. There has been rather little
research carried out in this specific field, especially from a linguistic perspective.
Therefore, it will be interesting to see what labels are given to the foundations and what
connotations the labels have and how this might affect society and makeup users alike.
The labels not only reflect on the company’s image, but to some extent they also reflect
certain attitudes towards skin tone.
To provide a brief overview of the structure of the thesis, a chapter on connotations and
colour perception is outlined first. The chapter introduces and defines connotations.
Colour perception as well as the connotations invoked by colours and skin tones in
specific are also discussed. The history of makeup is then explored, with specific attention
to the reasons why women have worn makeup throughout history. After this, the materials
and method for the present study are presented before moving on to the analysis. Finally,
the results of the analysis are discussed and some conclusions as well as suggestions for
further research are presented.

Meaning and colours
2.1

Meaning

Linguists try to make sense of language by studying it in all the different ways it is used
and the changes it undergoes in-between. There are many different fields one can study
within linguistics, and for this thesis the interest lies within the field of semantics.
Semantics refers to the study of meaning, which leads us to a more complex question:
what is meaning? Fodor (1980: 9) states that the concept of “meaning” originates from
the field of philosophy, suggesting that it was the philosophers who initially attempted to
define it. Fodor (1980: 9-10) continues saying that there might not even be a clear answer
as to what meaning is, or that a simple single answer to the question might not even exist.
Nevertheless, linguists have attempted to define meaning and what it entails. Goddard
(1998: 6) points out that it is of great importance to distinguish ‘meaning’ from ‘use’.
Now, it is true that in most cases the meaning of the linguistic expression or word is also
related to how it is used.
Valenzuela (2017: 3) states that “[for] some authors, semantics concerns the study of
meaning as communicated through language, while for some others, semantics studies all
aspects of meaning”. In semantics the interest is in studying the relations between
different words as well as how we determine and define the meaning of a word. Naturally
of course, one word can have several meanings and be ambiguous. The word is usually
completely bound to the context in which it appears. However, people are capable of
interpreting words in a different manner, sometimes even in the wrong way than what the
speaker or writer intended. Hence, misunderstandings can arise. ‘Agreeing to disagree’ is
indeed a common way of dismissing a contested topic as a matter of semantics.
Linguists have proposed various ways of defining the concept of connotation. Murphy
(2010: 33) states that “[connotations] are semantic associations that a word has”. The
interest when examining the different connotations of a word is to explore the so called
“‘secondary’ meanings” (Valenzuela, 2017: 102). This entails an exploration of all
associations and meanings a word has. Valenzuela (2017: 102) states that some
connotations are universal. Gill (2011: 10) refers to connotations as rather individual and
therefore naturally also subjective. How we associate different words with different

3

Jennie Selén
meanings is not always universal, but it is usually based on the specific individual and is
connected to his or her experiences and thoughts.
Valenzuela (2017: 61) suggests that parallels can be drawn between the human brain and
a computer program in the sense that they both “manipulate symbolic structures according
to syntactic rules”. Some scientists claim that the way in which vocabulary is stored in
the human brain is constructed reminiscent of dictionaries (Jefferies, 1998: 38). Humans
are typically able to select a context-appropriate word from a number of potential
alternatives. It is usually a specific meaning of a word we are looking for, which fits the
context of our conversation. However, this is not always the case: we might fail to find
the word we are seeking. One might, for example, fail to recall an expression or even
erroneously choose one that is entirely inappropriate given the context.
Moreover, “[according] to many scholars, minds are ‘symbol systems’” (Valenzuela,
2017: 59). Valenzuela (2017: 66) says that what we see, and experience, becomes bound
to “’concepts’ or ‘categories’”. Therefore, the associations and connotations a word
evokes for a person are based on experiences that the person has had, and are thus
inherently linked to memories and lived experiences. It is very challenging to study
connotations because they may vary from person to person, some perhaps more than
others. This means that every time we perceive an object or entity for example, it adds to
our existing knowledge and understanding of a word, and possibly alters our earlier
perceptions of the word as well.
Bussmann (1996: 6 in Gill, 2011: 10) observes that single words in particular tend to have
a range of different connotations, depending of course, on who the observer is. The
example provided by Gill (2011: 10), is to take the word red. The word can be associated
with “blood, communism, fire, Santa Claus”, while some even say it is the colour which
symbolises power and dominance. While the potential range of associations is far more
extensive still, the example illustrates the breadth of connotations a seemingly simple
word such as red may assume.
So, what then determines the nature and meaning of a word? And whether it has for
example a positive or negative connotation in its natural form? Some words are naturally
negative, whereas some words are not naturally negative in their meaning, but can be
4

Jennie Selén
viewed as such irrespective of the context they are used in and the connotations they have
(Valenzuela, 2017: 102-103). The reasons for this might be a cultural matter or a personal
matter, where the words refer to something that has happened and is viewed as negative.
This means that the word is associated with a negative experience or something which is
regarded as negative. Valenzuela (2017: 102-103) also states that the connotations of a
word differs depending on in which context it appears.
2.2

Colours

Scientists have to this day not been able to specifically determine the “color vision
process” (Kuehni, 2005: 17). The specific phenomenology is debated, as we cannot
reliably ascertain how the biological functions carried out by our perceptive organs and
the nervous system translate to the lived experience of colour. Regardless, one could say
that colour is perceived differently by each individual: it is a completely personal process
and experience. The optical process occurs naturally and is a part of our everyday
activities. There is an immense number of objects that can be found in our surroundings
and we see so many things throughout the day with our eyes. Colour perception is a
necessity for a range of everyday activities. We use our eyes and colour perception to
assess whether “an object is old or new, fresh or stale, beautiful or ugly, unused or worn,
without recognising the actual optical processes that give us the clues” (Choudhury 2014:
103). Another example to highlight this is when a person who is driving observes the road
and takes the colour of the surface into consideration to determine whether it can be
dangerous. This process typically occurs subconsciously, requiring little overt attention.
Choudhury (2014: 103) provides further excellent examples of this: a person who
specialises in agriculture, a cultivator or a farmer for example, examines the soil, whose
colour indicates its state and condition. Some people judge whether the clothes they are
set to put on for the day are clean based on whether stains can be found. Perhaps there is
a red stain because some ketchup was spilled yesterday when eating a hamburger, or
perhaps there is a brown stain because some coffee managed to slip out of the cup and
fell down on the shirt.
Different languages and cultures have a different number of what they consider as basic
colours (Goddard, 1998: 114). Some cultures lack the word for ‘blue’, for example, but
do have several different words to describe the brightness or darkness of a specific colour.

5

Jennie Selén
The vocabularies used to refer to and identify colours vary greatly between languages and
cultures. Gill (2011: 1) states that “[colour] words are an ideal lexical set” and he goes on
saying that colours are intriguing in the sense that they tend to have “extended,
metaphorical and/or connotative meanings”.
The variability in naming and classifying colours naturally extends to skin tones. Before
discussing skin colours, we will first look at some common connotations of the colours
black and white, since these words are usually used to define the skin colour of different
ethnicities. The aim is to provide a few examples highlighting how connotations work in
practice and to show how complex and ambiguous connotations are.
“White may be said to represent light, without which no color can be seen”
– Leonardo da Vinci (in Eldridge, 2015: 52).
The quotation above suggests that white is essential to the perception of colour as without
it “no colour can be seen”. The word white is also viewed as being a marker of “purity,
freshness and cleanliness” (Choudhury, 2014: 318). In hotels the dominant colour of the
bedding and towels are usually white since it symbolizes cleanliness and sometimes also
quality. In a hospital the dominant colour in the surroundings for example of the bedding,
lab coats and pads also tend to be white as it also here is an indicator for cleanliness.
Some products, like wool and cotton, are bleached to enhance their appearance (Hunter,
1975 in Choudhury, 2014: 318). The reason why this is done, is mainly to increase their
value: wool and cotton are seen as dirty when in their natural colour. In some cases the
process of transforming an object, or material into white may immediately increase the
value of the different products.
Oxford English Dictionary 1 (s.v. white) defines the word white as “the lightest colour
possible, that of milk or freshly fallen snow” 2. OED also defines white as referring to
“[whiteness] or fairness of complexion”. Another definition by OED is that white is
“[free] from malignity or evil intent; beneficent, innocent, harmless, esp. as opposed to
something characterized as black”. This suggest that the word white may be associated
1

6

Jennie Selén
with freedom because it stands in contrast with the word black. Another view on the
matter is the associations that “Europeans and Africans would compromise the equations
of blackness and slavery, whiteness and freedom” (Hodes, 1999: 28).
OED (s.v. black) defines black as “the darkest colour possible, that of soot, coal, the sky
on a moonless night in open country”. The word black also refers to the population with
a darker skin colour and Merriam-Webster Dictionary 3 (s.v. black) defines black as used
for “relating to African American people or their culture”. Besides referring to African
American people and their culture, the word has some less pleasant connotations: the
word black is described as referring to something that is filthy; M-W illustrates this with
the example “hands black with grime”. Furthermore, black is associated with “a time of
day or year, a shadow, etc.: enveloped in darkness” (OED, s.v black). Per M-W (s.v.
black), the word indicates the “absence of light”, referring to both the night and to
darkness, which is associated with the unknown and perhaps even viewed as scary. M-W
also defines black as “connected with or invoking the supernatural and especially the
devil”. Furthermore, M-W defines the word black as “marked by the occurrence of
disaster”, providing the example of “black Friday”, which refers to the financial crisis
which broke out in 1975. More famous still is the ‘black death’, a moniker given to the
bubonic plague pandemic which ravaged the world in the 14th century. Finally, the word
black is used in literature to describe black humour which implies that it is “characterized
by grim, distorted, or grotesque satire” (M-W).
To sum up the connotations of white and black, white clearly has more positive
connotations than black. The meanings of the two words are the literal opposites of one
another: while white stands for purity, black symbolises impurity and while white is
associated with light black is associated with darkness. The most valuable connotation
for white seems to be freedom. Overall, black also seems to be an indicator of something
which is negative, and as discussed above it can be tied to darkness and the unknown and
with being used to mark natural disasters or grim literature.

Skin colour
“We are united, and divided, by our skin color”
(Jablonski, 2012: 13)

Our skin colour is a part of our identity, and “[perhaps] no other feature of the human
body has more meaning” (Jablonski, 2012: 13). It is intriguing how many different
functions the skin has: the skin functions first and foremost as the body’s shield,
protecting it from different kinds of harm “yet maintains an exquisite sensitivity to touch,
temperature, and pain” at the same time (Jablonski, 2012: 18). Skin colour is a very
sensitive topic and people tend to consider and examine their skin colour, often in relation
to others. But when does skin colour begin to play such an important role? No one is born
with prejudices, and no one is born a racist. So, when do we become aware of what skin
colour we have and that it comes with certain connotations? Jablonski (2012: 13) states
that she herself became aware of skin colour and the notions it brought with it at quite a
young age.
It is common that people base their perception to a large extent on what they see. Of
course, what we see is then tied together with what we experience. This may be why we
pay so much attention to different details such as skin colour (Jablonski, 2012: 91).
Jablonski (2012: 91) states that humans have a tendency which fits with the quote
“[monkey] see, monkey do”. What she means by this is that humans have a built-in
system of imitating what we see and learning from it. Small children carefully pay
attention to their mothers, examining how they move and what they do and then attempt
to imitate the words, or especially the sounds to which they are exposed. Jablonski (2012:
94-96) claims that at the age of three, children begin to associate different notions related
to skin colour. However, she does point out that the different notions children experience
and the concepts that develop are not solely based on what it is that children have seen; it
is when others, usually adults, help the children interpret and give words and concepts
meaning. What children hear and register then becomes tied to what they see with their
eyes.
As children grow up and become of school age, they quickly learn how to assess which
individuals are the odd ones out: which people belong to certain groups and which do not
8

Jennie Selén
(Jablonski, 2012: 91, 96). How parents behave and what worldviews they have tend to
have an impact on their children and their behaviour. At the age of six, children start to
grasp the concept of social groups and how these groups function. Additionally, children
begin to formulate feelings, views, and attitudes regarding these.
Skin colour is essentially said to correlate with complexion and delicate related issues,
especially if we consider the unpleasant events that have taken place throughout history,
mainly those related to racism like slavery etc. Even though it is normal to meet people
of different ethnicities today, this was not really something our forefathers knew. Before
the events of globalisation, with the rise of technology and networks, a few centuries back
people did not make it far from where they were born (Jablonski, 2012: 32). Back then it
was very common that generations lived in the same town, even in the same city, without
moving anywhere. Some notions do still live on today, meaning that different skin colours
are met with different attitudes and associations depending on the context.
Colourism refers to the phenomenon in which people with whiter skin are considered to
be more privileged and of more value (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 281). Colourism came
to be a notion during the time of colonisation and slavery. Throughout the years, people
of white ethnicity have been viewed as superior and have possessed a dominant position
in society. This is, arguably, still the case today. Glenn (2008: 286) says that “[color]
consciousness in the African American community has generally been viewed as a legacy
of slavery”. She notes that during the era of slavery, when a white man and an indigenous
woman had a child together, ‘a mulatto’, as such a child was called, the child’s status
would be considerably better compared to that of the natives, who had a darker skin colour
(Glenn 2008: 286-287).
Kerr (2005: 272-273) talks about “the paper bag test” which was something used to
determine a person’s place in society based on their skin colour. By placing a paper bag
next to people with a darker coloured skin it determined what tasks they would be fit to
do in society. The notion was that “lighter-skinned blacks were better suited for intelligent
tasks, such as craftmanship, or lighter labor” while blacks with a darker skin colour were
often used for hard labour and even enslaved (Kerr, 2005: 273).

Now that we have explored colour perception and common connotations with the colours
white and black, and addressed colourism and what it entails, it is time to move on to
examining the history of makeup. The following chapter explores different skin colour
trends throughout history and the techniques used to establish the desire.

The history of makeup

This chapter takes a few steps back in time. The interest is to explore how long makeup
has been used, who used it and for what purpose. Firstly, attitudes towards skin colour
throughout history are discussed. Thereafter we will take a closer look and discuss what
makeup used throughout time was made of and the effects it had on the health.
3.1

Attitudes towards skin colour throughout time

“Whiteness is most often associated with beauty, purity, and graciousness, while
blackness symbolizes ugliness, evilness, and incivility” (Harrison and Reynolds-Dubbs,
2009: 254). The aforementioned associations are commonly held, but that there are other,
more complex associations which are commonly overlooked. For centuries, the goal or
rather the desire within the field of women’s beauty and cosmetics was to have a palelooking face (Eldridge, 2015: 44). It could be argued that a preference for pale skin
persists to this day. Historically, it was common for people based in Europe and the
Eastern part of the world to use products such as “creams, ointments, and cosmetics”
which allowed them to make their face look lighter (Eldridge, 2015: 43):
From the Greek lead-based psimuthion to the practice of
bloodletting and the infamous Venetian ceruse (recognizable as
that white powder you often see aristocrats wearing in sixteenthcentury period dramas), there is a wide-ranging and cross-cultural
tradition of lightening one’s skin in order to fit into a beauty-based,
cultural, or social ideal.
(Eldridge, 2015: 43)
With this citation we can note that the tradition to make the face appear lighter is not a
new notion, but something that dates back all the way to ancient Greece. Some of the
different methods of whitening one’s skin throughout the years are presented in the
following section.
3.2

Methods of whitening one’s skin

Allegedly, the practice of whitening one’s skin using lead dates back to, at least, ancient
China and was a common practice used for this purpose. Researchers have speculated on
findings which show evidence of the usage of lead, for “cosmetic purposes” already as

11

Jennie Selén
early as 1600-1046 BC in the Shang Dynasty (Eldridge, 2015: 52). In the Shang Dynasty
lead was processed into powder, making it easier to apply on the face.
Researchers have also discovered that during the time of the Trojan War there appears to
have been a “desire for alabaster skin” (Eldridge, 2015: 44). There is further evidence
from burial sites that has enabled researchers to determine approximately what Greek
women looked like during the golden age. The findings further indicate a desire of having
a fair-looking face as apparently, Greek Women used products, usually lead, in order to
make their face paler.
Furthermore, it was common for women in the Roman Empire to whiten their faces by
using products such as lead (Little, 2016). During the 16th century the English nobles
practiced the same methods alongside their Queen Elizabeth I with the desire to alter their
appearances and have pale or white faces. Queen Elizabeth I is commonly known to have
had a pale complexion.
Ceruse was made by combining lead and sharp vinegar, which was
left to steep until it formed a skin, after which the process was
repeated until the lead became a powder, a procedure remarkably
similar to the Greek and later Roman methods.
(Eldridge, 2015: 52)
Eldridge (2015: 43) points out that the practice of applying the powdered lead, most likely
had a negative impact on not only the skin but also on the wearer’s general health.
However, interestingly enough, this practice of attempting to appear as pale as possible,
or at least paler than one’s original skin tone was, was less harmful if the woman was
poor: poor women’s makeup was much gentler to the skin compared to the methods and
products that upper-class women used (Eldridge, 2015: 62). Writers have come across
literature describing what was used to create the so called “recipes” for the products
utilized. Such recipes consisted of “chickpeas, barley, almonds, horseradish seeds, and
milk” all of which are actually quite gentle to the skin compared to the method of applying
pure lead onto one’s skin (Eldridge, 2015: 62). The recipe for upper-class women, mixing
lead together with vinegar, was anything but gentle to the skin (Eldridge, 2015: 58-59).
A heavy use of this recipe usually had rather serious side-effects and a negative impact

12

on the health, such as the skin becoming discoloured, the teeth began to rot, and the hair
started to fall out.
3.3 So, why the desire to change the colour of your skin?
As already discussed, it was very common for women, and also men, to lighten their face
not to mention that powerful individuals such as Cleopatra and Queen Elizabeth I also
used skin-whitening products to make their faces even paler than they were. But why was
there such a need to lighten one’s skin despite the detrimental health? Historians have
explained the use of the home-made whitening products by the two powerful women due
to the fact that a pale appearance was “not only a mark of beauty, but of refinement and
gentility” (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 283). Queen Elizabeth I is said to have used lead,
not only to make her face appear pale or white, but with a purpose of trying to hide the
scars she had from smallpox (Eldridge, 2015: 67).
Historians have explained that especially women wanted to have a pale face since it was
considered not only a sign of youth but also a marker that the woman was still a virgin,
and pale skin was hence associated with fertility and good health (Eldridge, 2015: 42-44).
Earlier, men considered youth, health and fertility highly desirable traits in a potential
bride, as these qualities helped to ensure that they would receive a healthy offspring to
carry on their lineage.
Furthermore, pale skin indicated a higher social status amongst women (Eldridge, 2015:
63; Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 283). Kenway and Bullen (2011: 283) suggest that the
reason for this is that the many of the upper-class women spent their time inside, which
meant that their skin had minimal exposure to sunlight, meaning that their skin would be
naturally light or pale. Working women, i.e. those of a lower social status, in contrast
spent most of their time outdoors, having their skin exposed to the sun daily for several
hours (Eldridge, 2015: 57). Therefore, working women tended to have a somewhat more
tanned skin colour.
Makeup was also used in the theatres as a mask or a sort of cover for the actors doing
theatrical performances (Jones, 2010: 63). There were two specific names, or brands
which came to be considered highly prestigious and very valuable for theatrical makeup
13

Jennie Selén
and these were Bourjois and Leichner. Bourjois’ and Leichner’s goal was to build a
sustainable brand and introduce the market to a product which was “socially acceptable”
(Jones, 2010: 63). The brand Leichner was created by Ludwig Leichner, who came to be
known for two important achievements in particular. Firstly, he “pioneered grease paints
in stick form” (Jones, 2010: 63). Secondly, Leichner also found a way to produce makeup
without the usage of lead, although, this new powder formula for lead-free makeup was
primarily intended for use in the theatrical realm. Throughout the years it has been
speculated whether makeup and the usage of it was positive or negative (Jones, 2010: 63).
Ethical objections had more of an influence on the change to the cosmetics industry
compared to other reasons such as social values. Cosmetic products such as makeup in
particular became associated with fashion during the end of the 19th century.
Last but not least, one rather peculiar fact worth noting is what Kenway and Bullen (2011:
283) have speculated over why there has been a desire for light skin in places like Japan,
Korea, China and the Philippines. In Japan a whitening product for the skin was
introduced in 1917, but what it was that inspired the launch of this product cannot really
be explained (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 283).
3.3

Skin colour attitudes today
[…] the use of skin whitening agents among people of colour has
come to be viewed as an active attempt to erase or mask racial
identity. The twentieth century fashion for tanned skin among
white populations is not regarded as comparable.
(Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 282)

Richard Dyer (1997: 49) also states that people with a white skin colour have always had
the liberty to experiment with their skin. It does not really make a difference if they try
and make it even lighter or use products to make it appear more tanned; beneath it all they
are still white and do not suffer any “loss of prestige” by doing so (Richard Dyer 1997:
49). A black person does not have the same liberties and is not free to experiment as he
or she pleases without consequences. A person with a darker skin colour who attempts to
make their skin lighter will expose him- or herself to mockery and further discrimination.
Nowadays it is fashionable for people to alter their natural skin colour, and lightening the
skin is a trend that still lives on today. However, presently it is also a common desire to
14

Jennie Selén
appear tanned which is achieved using products such as fake tan. Global Industry
Analysts estimated that there would be a rapid increase of products available for this
purpose and that this would be one of the most rapidly growing sectors within the
cosmetic industry by the year 2015 (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 281). The products have
of course come a long way and are considerably better and safer to use compared to the
products used a century ago. However, the usage of products, which are aimed for
lightening the skin, lived on to be a problem in Africa (Davids et al. 2016: 24-26). Women
in Africa believe that lightening their skin would increase their value and social standing.
3.4

Cosmetic companies

It can be said that the first mission cosmetic companies have is to make women believe
their skin needs some form of correction or alteration. It comes across as if cosmetic
companies use their advertisement techniques and products to create an illusion of the
perfect woman. This practice, of setting unrealistic expectations, is likely to foster a sense
of inadequacy. Cosmetic companies encourage women to use skin creams to fight
wrinkles, make their skin extra smooth or make it glow, and to buy full coveragefoundation to assure that they look their best. Simultaneously, they market their products
by telling women that each and every one is unique and beautiful, still suggesting that
they could use a little extra ‘fix’ to bring out their ‘true beauty’.
There are many different shades available for people with lighter or whiter skin, whereas
the darker the skin tone, the fewer options there are to choose from. There has been some
discussion regarding the poor selection of cosmetic products for people with darker skin
(Fleming, 2019). It also seems to be quite difficult for people with an olive skin tone or
naturally tanned skin to find a suitable foundation (Galloway, 2016). It appears as if
cosmetic companies not only fail to acknowledge people with a darker complexion, but
disregard anyone with a skin tone which deviates from the ideal.
Kenway and Bullen (2011: 279) suggest that studies often highlight how cosmetic
companies and the beauty industry in general portray women of different ethnicity: they
tend to be “contextualized in relation to race and whiteness.” This fragment suggest that
the implication is that whiteness is not only dominant and favourable, but also a standard
by which other skin tones are evaluated, measured, perceived and discussed. Furthermore,

15

Jennie Selén
Valenzuela (2017: 105) says that “how you name your product affects how people
conceptualize it”. Therefore, it is important for companies to consider what labels they
give their products.

Materials and methods
4.1

Materials

Today there are a multitude of companies and an even greater variety of different products
to choose from, for which reason I developed a more restricted approach. The materials
for this study were extracted from the websites of 20 cosmetic companies. This approach
allowed full access to the companies’ entire selection. The materials were retrieved from
the worldwide versions of these sites where possible.
The selection of the material was random and done as follows. I began by searching for
“makeup foundation” in Google as an attempt to identify potential cosmetic brands. My
search lead me to a site called “Sephora”. Sephora is a makeup site, whose selection
consists of a large number of different makeup brands, both budget and luxury. Sephora
is one of the leading makeup retailers on the market. Founded in 1998, Sephora has
roughly 2,600 stores located in 36 countries all around the world (Sephora, 2020).
Therefore, Sephora’s seemed to be a good choice, due to its broad selection. After having
selected random makeup brands through my Google search as well as randomly from
Sephora, I visited that specific makeup brand’s own webpage or company site, since there
they detail all the colours of that specific product. My intention was that the selection of
my material was as international as possible, which is why I searched both via Google
and on Sephora.
I chose one product, i.e. one foundation from each of the cosmetic companies’ sites. I
then examined the foundation more thoroughly. Since there are several different kinds of
foundation, and some of the cosmetic companies have several foundations to choose
from, my main selection criterion was to opt for a liquid foundation.
I gathered my data from October to December 2019. It is worth noting that the selection
of the different foundations changes constantly. Some shades and products might be
added while some might be removed. The selection available during that period may
differ from the products or range of shades available at present.

17

Jennie Selén
4.2

Methods

To analyse the material, the data were compiled into an Excel table. For each entry, data
on the cosmetic company, product name, shade category, label and meaning category
were included to provide me with a preliminary overview of emerging and possibly
repeating patterns. Furthermore, the Excel table allowed me to more easily examine and
analyse the data.
I began the analysis by examining the labels and attempting to identify parameters by
which the foundations could be categorised, after which I examined the categories and
possible subcategories more closely. After sorting the data and having divided it into
categories, the next step was to examine what labels are used and how they are used. The
aim of the study was to identify patterns in the ways foundations of different shades are
marketed to consumers with different skin tones and, in particular, whether different
labels are typically applied to products aimed at different consumer groups. The primary
aim of the analysis is to see whether there are any specific stereotypes regarding which
labels are used for the three different shade categories. My aim was also to investigate
whether there are differences in the companies’ approaches.
Since the aim of this study was to solely examine the labels of the different products, I
have decided to exclude additional information which some of the cosmetic companies
provide for their products. Some example of these are an additional number, placed either
before the label, or as a separate description. What all of these numbers do have in
common is that the scale runs from smallest to highest, where the smallest number marks
the lightest shade and the highest number indicates the darkest shade. Some of the
foundations also include a more detailed description of the shade for example “rosy
undertones”. To include all the additional information available would have been too
extensive for this thesis, whereby the scope has been limited to name of the shade only.
Based on the information found on the cosmetic companies’ websites, the different labels
tend to be divided into three main categories: light or fair, medium or tan and dark or
deep colours. Some of the companies also categorise the shades as “light-medium” or for
example “very dark”. Some cosmetic companies do not categorise their foundations by
colour, although many of cosmetic companies do provide the customer with some sort of

18

Jennie Selén
indication of colour classification, which is usually marked on pictures included on the
site. Some of the pictures show arms of different skin colours, onto which they have
applied the different shades of foundations. The pictures commonly depict skins of three
different tones on which the product has been applied. The pictures can be viewed as an
attempt to enable women to try to colour match themselves at home based on the picture,
or might be there to show which foundation should be used for each skin colour.
Therefore, instead of having many different categories of shades I have decided to narrow
these down to what appears to be the most common shade categories, meaning light,
medium and dark. In some instances I have had to re-categorise and determine the shades
of the products myself. I have chosen to do it in the following manner as it simplifies the
process and it allows for a thorough analysis of what connotations different labels have
for different colours depending on who they are aimed for.
Some labels have a modifier in front of them, like the label Pink Alabaster for instance,
where Pink is the modifier and Alabaster the head word. The focus in this analysis will
be on the head words, however, since there are many modifiers and they do play an
important role in the sense that they provide a specification of the head word, the most
frequently used modifiers are also discussed and examined.
Altogether, there are 12 main categories which will be discussed first. It is important to
note that some labels have an ambiguous meaning that fits into several different
categories. An example of this is the label Ivory, which is associated with an animal, a
material and a colour. Furthermore, some of the main categories can be split into
subcategories. The category “consumables” for example includes the subcategory
“drinks” which in turn can be divided into such subcategories as “coffee” and “tea”.
After discussing the meaning categories, or main categories, the connotations of the most
frequently used labels are examined. The labels which are used at least four times for
each of the three different shade categories, meaning for light, medium and darker shades,
are discussed. In order to examine the different connotations, meanings of words and
functions the different labels have, I have used the Oxford English Dictionary as the
primary source. However, sometimes if the connotation or meaning seems to be

19

Jennie Selén
incomplete, for instance when there is limited information, I have also used the MerriamWebster Dictionary.

Analysis

This chapter begins with a presentation of the different meaning categories, starting with
the largest category to which most products belong to. The different main categories along
with the subcategories are discussed and examined. The total number of products by the
twenty different cosmetic companies is 628. Some of the cosmetic companies offer up to
as many as 50 different shades, while others have a considerably smaller selection,
consisting of as few as five shades. It is worth mentioning that some labels appear in
several different categories because they have a polysemous or ambiguous meaning, as
stated earlier. However, it would be wrong to exclude them from one category.
5.1

Examining the categories

Table 1 below illustrates the main categories of product labels for liquid foundations. The
number of product labels belonging to each of the identified categories is depicted. The
labels are also divided into three groups depending on the shade of the product; the
distribution of product labels by shade is shown.

Consumables

The largest category of labels is “consumables”, containing 196 products. “Consumables”
refers to foods, or beverages and other items meant for human consumption. Some
examples of labels belonging to this category are Almond, Espresso and Vanilla. Let us

21

Jennie Selén
begin by examine the distribution of the different labels between each shade category
belonging to “consumables”. There are 22 different labels for the 30 products for light
shades of foundation, while for the 56 products for medium shades there are 41 different
labels, and for the 110 products for dark shades there are 60 different labels. These
numbers show that there is variation in the number of different labels for the three shade
categories within the meaning category “consumables”. “Consumables” is an umbrella
term, and consists of different subcategories which we will explore next.
Table 2 shows the different subcategories belonging to the main category “consumables”.
The table depicts the number of products belonging to each of the three different shade
categories, and the total number of products per category and per shade.

The subcategory “nuts” contains 49 products in total. The majority of labels, meaning 35
out of 49 products, are dark shades of foundations. There are considerably fewer products
with labels related to nuts in the other two shade categories. The labels Walnut, Chestnut
and Hazelnut are solely used for products which are categorised as dark shades of
foundations. The label Almond, which is used for 18 products, is used in a rather
interesting way: the label has been used both for light, medium and dark foundations.
DRINKS
Table 4 shows the distribution of labels belonging to the subcategory “drinks”. The items
are further divided into four subcategories of drinks (“Coffee”, “Alcohol”, “Tea” and
“Other”). The number of labels in each category is provided below:

In total, there are 37 products which fit into the subcategory of “drinks”. The “drinks” are
further split into three subcategories, which are “coffee”, consisting of 30 products, “tea”

Coffee Bean is included in the “drinks” category as it in most cases is used to make coffee out of.

23

Jennie Selén
and “alcohol”, which consists of three products each. To explore a few labels belonging
to “coffee”, we can note that the most frequently occurring labels are Mocha and
Espresso. Latte and Macchiato, are examples of labels used to describe medium shade of
foundations. The label Latte is used for both a medium and a dark foundation. Many of
the labels related to coffee are used for darker shades. There are hardly any coffee-related,
nor other drink-related labels in the other two shade categories.
The category “tea” only contains the label Chai, which is used for three products. For two
of the products it is used as a label for a dark shade, while one occurrence of Chai is used
as a label for a product of a light shade. Finally, we have the labels belonging to the
“alcohol”- category, which are Cognac, Amaretti and Spiced Rum. Amaretti is used to
describe a medium shade of foundation and Cognac and Spiced Rum are used for dark
foundations. The only label belonging to the “other” category in “drinks” is the label Milk,
which is used for a light shade of foundation.
SPICES
In total, there are 21 products with labels referring to spices. Vanilla is the most frequently
used label and it is used as a head word for 10 products. In every instance Vanilla is used
for light foundations. Cinnamon is the second most frequent label and is used for five
products: once as a label for a medium foundation and the remaining four times for dark
foundations. The label Nutmeg is used for three different products, in each case for dark
foundations. Lastly, the label Rich Ginger is used once for a dark foundation.
DESSERTS AND SWEETS
The subcategories “Desserts” and “Sweets” each contains a large number of labels. Even
though the subcategories could be treated as one, I have decided to separate them since
labels related to “desserts” are words such as cakes, pudding and biscuits, and “sweets”
are words such as chocolate and caramels.
The subcategory “desserts” contains 21 products in total. The distribution of labels which
belong to this subcategory is quite equal for each of the three different shade categories.
The subcategory consists of several different labels of a large array of different desserts.
Some examples of labels that have been placed in the “desserts” subcategory, which are
used to describe lighter shades, are Custard, Macaroon, and Panna Cotta, and examples
24

Jennie Selén
of labels for medium shades of foundations are Cheesecake, Baklava and Brulee. Lastly,
some examples of the labels for dark foundations which belong to this subcategory are
Tiramisu, Truffle and Ganache.
The subcategory “Sweets” consists of a total number of 28 products and, in contrast to
“desserts”, has three labels that occur quite frequently. The labels belonging to this
subcategory are used for products of medium or dark shades of foundations. The
distribution of the labels which belong to each of the two shade categories is quite equal.
Some examples of labels belonging to this subcategory, which are used for medium
shades of foundations are Toffee, Caramel and Butterscotch. Labels such as Chocolate,
Praline and Truffle are used for products which are dark foundations.
SWEETENERS
This subcategory consists of 22 products, all of which share the head word Honey. Honey
is best categorised as a sweetener and is the only label of this type in the data. Honey is
used for all of the three different shade categories; however, the distribution is very
varied. Most of the labels are for medium foundations of which there are 16 products in
total. Honey is used only once as a label for a light foundation. There are five products
for dark shades of foundations which have the label Honey.
SOUPS
There is only one label which falls into the category “soups”, and that is the label Bisque.
Bisque occurs as a head word eight times. In half of all instances Bisque is used as a label
for medium shades, and the remaining four times for products of light shades.
PLANTS

“Plants” is quite a small subcategory, consisting of 10 products in total. The most products
in this subcategory are dark shades of foundations. The label Cocoa is used as a head
word for seven products, all of them are dark foundations. The label Wheat is only used
once for a medium foundation. Labels such as Flax and Olive also belong to this
subcategory. Flax is used as a label for one light foundation and Olive is used for one
medium foundation.

“Colours” make up the second largest category with a total number of 164 products. There
are 35 different labels for 56 products belonging to light shades of foundations. For
medium shades of foundations there are 49 different labels for 75 products. There are 27
different labels altogether for the 33 products categorised as dark shades of foundations.
Some examples of the labels which can be found in this category are Beige, Pink and
Brown. It is not surprising that products of different shades may be labelled a colour.
Nevertheless, some of the labels belonging to the “colour” category do belong to other
main categories as well, like the label Ivory for example, since as stated earlier the
meaning of the label is ambiguous.
Most of the products in the category “colours” are labelled Beige. In total 69 products
have the label Beige as a head word. The label Beige is used in a diverse manner as it is
mostly preceded by a modifier, which usually determines whether the product is light,
medium, or dark. Beige is used for light foundations 26 times in total, 39 times for
medium foundations and four times for dark foundations. The label Brown is used four
times and all of these instances are for dark foundations. Lastly, the label Pink is only
used once as a head word, as a descriptor for a light foundation. Pink appears two

26

Jennie Selén
additional times as a modifier, in front of a head word. These instances are also for light
foundations.
There are two labels, Fresco and Sepia, which are also included in the category “colours”.
Even though these labels can be viewed as colours, Fresco is most commonly associated
with art and Sepia with photography. Therefore, these two labels belong to words related
to colour but additionally to the category “art”. Fresco is used as a label for a medium
foundation and Sepia is used once for a medium foundation and once for a dark
foundation.

The third main category consists of “nature”- related words such as Cloud, Sand and Shell
and includes 76 products in total. The category “nature” is broad and is therefore divided
into subcategories to better describe and allow for a thorough analysis of the labels. The
subcategories are examined in the following section. The reason why there are many
labels related to nature might be that cosmetic companies wish to draw some inspiration
from natural elements.

27

Jennie Selén

Before moving on to discuss the different subcategories, let us examine the distribution
of the different labels between the shade categories. There are 15 different labels for 24
products of light shades. For medium shades, there are 23 different labels for 30 products.
Last but not least, there are 13 different labels for the total number of 22 products of dark
shades.
MINERALS
The largest subcategory of nature is “minerals”, consisting of 30 products in total. The
labels in this category are only used for light and medium products. There are 15 light
and 15 medium products in the data. The labels, which belong to “minerals” tend to have
either the head word Alabaster or Sand. Most of these are preceded by a modifier, with
the purpose again being a specification of the colour or definition of what undertones the
shade suits best for.
TREES

There are 19 words in total with labels related to “trees”. Most of the labels belonging to
this category are used to describe dark shades of foundations. The most frequently used
labels here have the head word Maple, Mahogany or Ebony. There is only one label for
light shades of foundation and that is Aspen. There are four labels which are used to
describe medium shades of foundations, like the labels Auburn and Hazel for example.
WEATHER

There are seven products with labels related to “weather”. The products which belong to
“weather” are either light or medium shades of foundations. The labels in this category
include head words such as Snow, Cloud, Sun, Dusk and Dawn. As the labels themselves
might give away, Snow and Cloud are used to describe products of light shades of
foundations, while Sun, Dawn and Dusk are used as labels for medium shades.
PLANTS AND FLOWERS

Like the subcategory “plants” in “consumables” there is a need for another subcategory
referring to plants for the main category “nature”. The labels in this subcategory refer to
non-edible plants and flowers. The subcategory “plants and flowers” is relatively small,

28

Jennie Selén
with three products and two discrete labels, Rose and Rattan”. The label Rattan is used
for a medium foundation and Rose for both for light and medium foundations.
5.1.4

Numbers

The category “numbers” includes 73 products in total. The labels which belong to this
category are quite self-explanatory. Cosmetic companies might opt to solely use numbers
as labels since it can be speculated that they do not really have any connotations, or at
least not any negative connotations such as other labels might have. All of the products
with numbered labels are numbered in ascending order from lightest to darkest shade.
Since “numbers” is the only category consisting of unambiguous labels, i.e. their meaning
is fixed, all of the products are different and therefore they each have their own number
and also their own label. There are a total number of 21 products which are light shades
of foundations, 33 products of medium foundations and 19 products for darker
foundations.
5.1.5

Materials

Table 7 shows the label head words which belong to the main category “materials”. The

The category “materials” has 62 products in total and consists of labels with head words
such as Linen, Porcelain and Ivory. Most of the labels in this category have been further
29

Jennie Selén
divided into subcategories that define the specific type of material the labels refer to.
Some of the labels are ambiguous. Altogether, there are 31 unique labels for the total
number of 58 products for light foundations. There are only two different labels for four
products which belong to the medium category. There are no products for darker shades
of foundation which belong to this category.
CERAMICS

The subcategory “ceramics” consists of only one label, Porcelain. Porcelain is used as a
head word for 19 products in all. All of the products with the label Porcelain are of a light
foundation.
FABRICS

This subcategory only contains seven products. Some examples of the labels belonging
to this category are Linen, Cashmere, Sateen and Silk. Linen is used four times; three
times for light shades and once for a medium shade of foundation. All of the other labels
are only used once, all for products of light shade.

There are 50 products which belong to the category “skin colours”. This is a complex
category, consisting of labels such as Nude, Natural and Tan. It is quite natural that these
kinds of labels, containing words commonly used to discuss skin tones in other contexts,
30

Jennie Selén
are popular. There are 14 different labels for the 27 products for light foundations. For
medium foundations there are 14 different labels for the 18 products. There are three
unique labels assigned to the five products which are dark in shade. Most products in
“skin colours” are of a light shade whereas dark products are the least numerous in this
category.

The category of labels related to “animals” consists of 35 products altogether. This
category consists of labels such as Swan, Fawn and Sable. The most frequent head word
is Ivory. There are 14 unique labels for the 25 products for light shades of foundations.
There are a total number of five different labels for the six products of a medium shade.
There are three unique labels for the four products of a dark shade. Light products are the
most numerous in this category; only a handful of medium and dark products have labels
relating to animals.
5.1.8

Places

The category “places” is considerably smaller than those already discussed, consisting of
34 products altogether. All labels belonging to this category are from one brand, NARS
Cosmetics. The labels refer to physical locations, like Siberia, Fiji and Namibia for
example. All the labels included in the category “places” are unique. Most products

31

Jennie Selén
belong to the medium shade category. Altogether there are nine unique labels for the nine
products of a light shade, 19 for medium shades and six labels for dark foundations.
5.1.9

Decorations

Table 10 shows the head words of the labels which belong to the main category
“decorations”. The table also shows how many products there are for each of the three

In total there are 28 products in the category “decorations”. The labels which belong to
this category are quite ambiguous, but all refer to something which can be viewed as
decorative. There are eight unique labels for the 15 products categorised as light
foundations and three unique labels for five products of a medium shade. Finally, there
are five different labels for eight products for dark foundations. Most of the labels in this
category are used for light foundations. Labels for light foundations include Alabaster,
Pearl, Marble and Shell for example. The only labels used for medium foundations are
Amber and Pebble. Amber, is the only label used for dark foundations.
5.1.10 Metals
“Metals” is yet another small category. The total number of labels in this category is 15.
None of the labels within this category are used for a light shade. There are five unique
labels for the seven products which belong to the medium shade group, and eight labels
used for dark shades of foundations, all of which are unique.

The head words of labels which belong to the “metals” category are Gold, Bronze and
Copper. Gold is mostly used as a modifier for another word and therefore, mostly appears
before a label. However, it also occurs as the head word eight times. In three of these
instances it is used as a label for medium foundations and the remaining five for dark
foundations. Bronze is used five times in total. It is used as a label for medium foundations
four times and once for a dark shade. Copper is only used as a label twice, both times it
is used as a label for a dark foundation.
5.1.11 Temperature
Table 12 shows the head words of the labels belonging to the main category
“temperature”. The table depicts the total number of products belonging to this category

The category consisting of labels related to “temperature” is relatively small; consisting
of only seven products. There are two unique labels for the three light products. There are
two unique labels for the two medium products. Two unique labels are found for the two
dark products. The only label head words in this category are Cool and Warm. There is

33

Jennie Selén
only one product with the label Cool, which is a light shade of foundation. Cool appears
as a modifier 23 times. The label Warm never appears on its own, but it is either used as
a pre-modifier or has another modifier in front of it.
5.1.12 Scale
Table 13 shows the label head words which belong to the category “scale”. The table also

The category “scale” is somewhat complex. It was a challenge to find a suitable category
to place these labels in, however, “scale” seems suitable since the labels define or describe
measurement of some sort. There are 11 products which belong to this category. Some
examples of label head words in this category are Neutral, Medium and Deep. There are
no products within this category used for light foundations. There are four different labels
for eight products of medium foundations and two different labels for the three products
for dark foundations. All of the labels in the category “scale”, only appear a few times,
only two to seven times as the head word. However, they are all used considerably more
preceding another word, i.e. functioning as a pre-modifier. Neutral is used four times as
a head word: three times for medium foundations, and once for a dark foundation.
Medium is used as a label on its own five times. Naturally, it has been used for medium
foundations. Deep occurs as a label twice for dark foundations.
5.2

Uncategorised labels

There are some labels which proved to be difficult to categorise. There are two labels
which do not readily fit into any of the aforementioned categories, namely the labels Flesh
and Deep Rich. The label Flesh could on the one hand fit into the category “skin colour”,
but on the other hand, it could be placed as in the “colour” category. Flesh cannot

34

Jennie Selén
technically be viewed as a skin colour per se, therefore it could be categorised as
belonging to its own “skin” category. According to M-W (s.v. flesh), Flesh does refer to
skin, but to the tissue under the skin, i.e. muscles and fat. Another connotation to consider
is that of ‘meat’, which flesh may refer to particularly in relation to animals.
The second complex label is Deep Rich. The head word Rich does not fit into any of the
existing main categories but can be categorised as an adjective. Furthermore, the labels
belonging to the categories “colours” and “metals”, consisting of labels like Beige and
Bronze could also be categorised as adjectives. However, the focus in this thesis is not to
examine the functions of the words, meaning if they are adjectives or such, and therefore,
with the existing categories, Deep Rich does not fit into any.
5.3

Connotations

The analysis will be done in the following way: firstly, the frequently occurring labels,
meaning labels with at least four occurrences within each shade category will be
examined. The frequently occurring labels for light products will be explored first,
followed by medium products and lastly the dark products.
Figure 1 presents the number of labels found within each shade category. There are 204
labels for light shades of foundations, 231 for medium and 193 for dark shades.

Figure 2: Frequently used labels for light foundations
The label Beige occurs most frequently. In total Beige occurs 26 times as a label for light
shades of foundations. According to OED (s.v. beige), beige primarily refers to a colour.
It is often also associated with wool in its raw or natural form, before it has been dyed or
bleached into being white. Additionally, beige is described as having a “yellowish-grey
colour” in OED. M-W (s.v. beige) defines beige as “pale” and “lacking distinction”.
Beige could therefore also be interpreted as bland and dull.
Ivory is the second most frequently used label and is used for 24 products in total. The
word ivory has an ambiguous meaning and is associated with an animal, a colour and a
material. OED (s.v. ivory) defines ivory as “[the] hard, white, elastic, and fine-grained
substance (being dentine of exceptional hardness) composing the main part of the tusks
of the elephant, mammoth”. OED does also list ivory as a colour referring to something
white, in particular with “whiteness of the human skin”. The word ivory can be associated
with not only value but also with beauty (M-W, s.v. ivory).
Porcelain is used as a label for a total of 19 products. According to OED (s.v. porcelain),
the word porcelain refers to a “ceramic material made from china clay”. Porcelain was
previously used as a material especially for the purpose of making china tea sets and in
dentistry for manufacturing crowns and veneers for example. China made out of
36

Jennie Selén
porcelain was viewed as being of high quality and very valuable (OED). Porcelain was
also used to make faces for dolls. The word porcelain can also be used in a figurative
manner, for example when referring to something that is very fine or fragile and
decorative. Therefore, the connotations of word porcelain are precious and valuable.
Next in turn are Vanilla and Sand, which both appear as labels for eight products each.
Starting with vanilla, which is primarily defined as a spice or as a flavour (OED s.v.
vanilla). The word vanilla has several connotations but refers primarily to a pod, or more
specifically to the substance that is collected from within the pod. The colour of the pod
is a dark brown. OED does state that vanilla can be used as a colour but does not define
the actual colour. The colour of vanilla can be associated with the flower which grows
alongside the pod. The colour of actual vanilla seems to be quite difficult to pinpoint but
an off-white or a slightly white-yellowish colour might be the closest we can get to a
colour classification. Vanilla can be associated with a scent for candles and fragrances
for instance (OED). The expression “plain vanilla” is commonly also used with the
purpose of describing something as dull or plain.
The word sand is defined as “a material consisting of comminuted fragments and waterworn particles of rocks” according to OED (s.v. sand). OED does not define sand as a
colour. M-W (s.v. sand) provides similar definitions as OED, but in addition describes the
word sand as having a “yellowish-gray color”. M-W also defines the word sand as
associated with “moments of a lifetime”. This entails that sand can be associated with
time, referring to particular occasions or the passing of time, for example. This may
suggest a slightly negative connotation in the sense that sand can be associated with the
passing of time and therefore linked with ageing.
The following labels, Alabaster, Light, Natural and Nude are used seven times each.
Alabaster primarily refers to a stone (OED, s.v. alabaster). More specifically, alabaster
is defined as:
An ornamental stone consisting of a fine-grained, compact, translucent
from gypsum or (esp. with reference to ancient artefacts) calcite, typically
white or tinted or clouded with yellow, red, and other colours, and suitable
for carving into vase, figures, etc.
(OED, s.v. alabaster)
37

Jennie Selén

It is worth noting that alabaster was commonly used for ornaments in ancient times and
used for luxury and high-value objects. As the quotation above also states, the colour of
alabaster was usually white, but as it was used for ornaments it could also be painted
different colours. Furthermore, alabaster is also used as an adjective and a figurative
device (OED). If alabaster appears as an adjective it can for instance indicate that
something has been made using that specific material, like a sculpture for example.
Alabaster is also used in a figurative sense to describe a white and smooth skin.
The next label is Light, which is described as “[that] natural agent or influence which
(emanating from the sun, bodies intensely heated or burning, and various other sources)
evokes the functional activity of the organ of sight” according to OED (s.v. light). Light
is described as having various descriptions and functions in OED, most of them
moderately technical, meaning that they are related to the visual process or referring to
light as a “visual sensation”. M-W (s.v. light) similarly to OED, classifies light as the
phenomenon which enables us humans to see. Moreover, M-W recognises the usage of
light in reference to a “light or pale color”. The word light is polysemous, meaning that
it is not necessary always linked with positivity. For example, describing something as
‘light’ can indicate that it is lacking colour.
OED (s.v. natural) describes natural as “[existing] in, determined by, conforming to, or
based on nature”. Furthermore, natural is described as something which is “[consistent]
with nature; normal, expected” (OED). This means that natural refers to something which
occurs naturally without any alterations and contains no artificial substances or inputs.
As for its use as a descriptor for humans, the following definition is provided: “[of] a
person, his or her appearance, attributes, etc.: having the normal form, colour, etc.; not
disfigured, disguised, or altered in any way”. Furthermore, natural can also refer to a
colour, indicating again that the colour in question occurs in its natural state and has not
been modified. This usually refers to fabrics or materials indicating that they remain in a
“unbleached and undyed state” (OED).
For nude, OED (s.v. nude) provides a few different definitions. Firstly, OED describes
nude as “an object, plant, animal, etc.: naked, bare; lacking natural covering, foliage, etc.;
smooth, hairless.” Nude is described as lacking something, something that is not quite
38

Jennie Selén
complete or finished, meaning something is missing. This can be viewed as a slightly
negative connotation. Additionally, nude is also used in art, referring to a painting of a
naked person, or a person without covering on his or her genital area. Lastly, nude is
defined by OED as referring to a colour, usually associated with either “pinkish beige
colour” or a sort of “flesh-coloured”.
The labels for Almond and Fair are both used for five products each. The word almond
primarily refers to “[an] oval, nut-like, oil-rich kernel with a light brown skin and a hard
pitted shell, most varieties of which are edible, obtained from the tree Prunus amygdalus”
(OED, s.v. almond). The reason for the seemingly contradictory use of the label Almond
for both light, medium and dark shades may be that the word can variably refer to the
light inside of the almond or to its darker shell. The word almond is indeed defined as a
colour by OED. OED lists almond as referring to “the light brown or yellowish-brown
colour of an almond kernel” and as “the delicate pink colour of almond blossom”.
Moreover, OED describes the colour of the shell around an almond as “light brown”. The
word almond is also defined as a decorative element which is possibly not an obvious
connotation when one thinks about an almond (OED).
The word fair is associated with a person or an object which is viewed as “[beautiful] to
the eye; of attractive appearance; good-looking” (OED, s.v. fair). OED also states that
fair can be used to describe “appearance, colour, personal qualities or attributes”, which
means that the word fair is used for describing qualities, often in a positive sense. The
“fair one” was commonly used to describe a woman or more specifically with the purpose
of “expressing a quality considered as characteristic of the female sex” (OED).
Furthermore, fair is associated with “hair or complexion: light as opposed to dark in
colour. Of a person: having such colouring” (OED).
The label Bisque is used four times for light shades. The word bisque is defined in OED
(s.v. bisque) as a term used for counting the score in tennis. M-W (s.v. bisque) in turn
describes bisque primarily as a type of soup. A bisque soup has a thick texture and
consists of ingredients such as cream, shellfish or game, but a bisque soup can also be
made of vegetables. Additionally, bisque is a common term used in interior design. It is
likely that the word is also used as a colour descriptor in this context.

39

Jennie Selén
A very interesting label is Pale which only occurs once in the material. However, due to
its connotations, it is important and worth to discuss. Pale refers to “a person’s
complexion, etc.: of a whitish or ashen appearance; lacking healthy colour; pallid, wan,
bloodless” (OED, s.v. pale). This is then usually linked together with signs of weak
health, which can furthermore be associated with an illness. OED also defines the word
pale as referring to a colour in two different manners. First, it can simply be associated
with “light, almost white”, and secondly pale correlated to a colour, one which “lacking
intensity or depth of colour” in addition to also “lacking in brightness or brilliancy”
(OED). If used in a figurative sense, pale does not only refer to a colour, but it is in
particular associated with the fact that a human is lacking colour from his or her face.

Figure 3: Frequently used labels for medium foundations
Let us now turn to the medium shades of foundations and look at the most frequent labels
in this category. Beige is the most frequently occurring label and used 39 times for
products of a medium shade. Since the label Beige is also a frequently used label for light
foundations, its connotations have been discussed in section 5.3.1
The following label is Honey, which occurs 16 times for foundations of a medium shade.
The word honey has several different meanings according to OED (s.v. honey). OED

40

Jennie Selén
defines the primary meaning of honey as referring to a sticky and sweet substance that is
most often produced by bees. Honey is also defined as “a yellowish or golden colour” and
can be used to describe colours related to skin and hair (OED). Furthermore, when used
in a figurative sense, the word honey can refer to something “good, pleasant, or desirable;
sweetness; mellifluousness of speech, music, etc.” (OED). This entails that the
connotations of the word honey are linked to positivity. This is supported by the fact that
the word honey can be used as a sort of nickname or pet name for a loved one, similar to
love and sweetheart. In slang, the word honey is also used when referring to a goodlooking woman (OED). If used as an attribute honey implies that something is sweet or
perhaps delightful.
Sand is used as a label for 12 products categorised as medium shades. Like Beige, Sand
is a common label for both light and medium products, and its connotations have been
discussed in section 5.3.1.
The labels Buff, Caramel, and Tan all occur seven times each. OED (s.v. buff) defines the
word buff as a shortening for the word buffalo. Curiously, all definitions listed in OED
have to do with the animal buffalo. M-W (s.v. buff) defines the word primarily as a sort
of apparel which has been made out of buff leather. M-W defines buff as “the state of
being nude” and “a moderate orange yellow” or “a light to moderate yellow”. M-W states
that the word buff can be used to refer to someone with “a physique enhanced by
bodybuilding exercises” if the word is used as an adjective (M-W).
The primary connotation of Caramel is that it is described as a sweet (OED, s.v. caramel).
OED does also define caramel as a substance which is used for colouring and flavouring
of various drinks, such as coffees, soft drinks and alcohol. Caramel is also associated
with “[the] colour of caramel brown” (OED). The colour of caramel defined in M-W (s.v.
caramel) as “golden-brown to dark brown”. The word caramel can be viewed as having
a positive connotation due to its sweetness.
The next label to be examined is Tan. OED’s (s.v. tan) first definition of tan is “[the]
crushed bark of the oak or of other trees, an infusion of which is used in converting hides
into leather”. Tan furthermore refers to “[the] brown colour of tan; tawny”. It is in

41

Jennie Selén
addition to this worth noting that OED lists tan as referring to “[the] bronzed tint imparted
to the skin by exposure to the sun or the weather”.
Natural is a label used for six products categorised as medium foundations. Since Natural
is also a frequently used label for lighter shades, the connotations of the word can be
found in section 5.3.1 where it is discussed.
Medium and Toffee are both used five times each as labels. A search for medium in OED
(s.v. medium) gives the following description, “[something] which is intermediate
between two degrees, amounts, qualities, or classes; a middle state.” This suggest that the
word medium is rather neutral. If the word medium is treated as an adjective, it indicates
that something is mediocre or average. This has a slightly negative connotation,
suggesting that it is not at its full potential. OED also defines medium as “a colour: in the
middle of a range of shades”.
The label Toffee is used as a label for five products and similar to the label Caramel. The
primary meaning of the word toffee is that of a sweet (OED, s.v. toffee). The colour toffee
is defined as being “[a] medium shade of brown”. Toffee is furthermore also used for
flavouring of various consumables such as desserts and spirits. Similar to caramel, toffee
can be viewed as having a positive association due to its sweetness.
The labels Amber and Bisque are both used four times. The word amber is defined as “[a]
fossil resin or its colour” (OED, s.v amber) and it is often used to make both jewellery
and ornaments from. This suggests a positive connotation. The use of amber as a raw
material dates back to antiquity (OED). In ancient times, amber was also used as a
fragrance and for medicinal purposes. Amber is described as itself being “typically
yellow, orange, or brown in colour” (OED). For this reason, it is stated that amber can be
used as an adjective, in which case it then refers to a colour (OED). The word amber is
in some contexts used for describing the colour of alcoholic beverages, especially beer.
Bisque is also a frequently used label for light foundations. Therefore, the analysis of
Bisque, along with the different connotations, can be found in the previous section 5.3.1.

The most frequently used label for dark shades is Mocha. Mocha is used as a label for 11
products in total. The word mocha is primarily associated with speciality coffee “of fine
quality” which tends to be “produced in or shipped from Yemen” (OED, s.v. mocha).
Mocha is also associated with “[the] colour of mocha coffee”, which is usually “a dark
brown colour”. Furthermore, mocha can also refer to desserts which usually contains
either the flavour or have the same colour. OED additionally defines mocha as referring
to “[a] type of fine sheepskin or (occasionally) goatskin leather, used esp. for making
gloves”.
Almond is used a as a label for 10 products in total. Almond was discussed above in section
5.3.2 since it was also a frequently used label for light shades of foundations. Therefore,
moving on to discuss the third most frequently used labels which are Espresso and
Walnut. Espresso and Walnut appear as label nine times each. There is a limited amount
of information available in OED on the word espresso. OED only defines espresso as a
type of coffee which is made using a steam coffee machine (s.v. espresso). M-W (s.v.
espresso) offers a similar definition of the word espresso. Espresso can be associated with
a very dark brown, sometimes even black, colour.

The word walnut primarily refers to a nut (OED, s.v. walnut). The name comes from the
tree in which it grows, which is naturally the walnut-tree (OED). The wood of the tree is
used as a material for manufacturing. Interestingly, OED does not provide any colour
description or association of the word walnut. M-W (s.v. walnut) on the other hand, does
define walnut as having “a moderate reddish brown” colour.
Amber and Chestnut both appear eight times each. The label Amber has already been
discussed, as it is also a frequently used label for medium foundations. For connotations
and further discussion please see section 5.3.2.
The word chestnut primarily refers to a nut (OED, s.v. chestnut). As previously mentioned
in relation to walnut, chestnut is also used to describe the material with which something
is made, meaning constructing something out of the chestnut-tree. There is very limited
information given about the word chestnut, although M-W (s.v. chestnut) does refer to it
as having a “grayish to reddish brown” colour. Additionally, M-W refers to chestnut as a
colour, however used for the purpose of describing a specific colour of a horse.
Cocoa is used as a label seven times and refers to both the tree, meaning the “cacao tree”
as well as to the “cocoa bean” (OED, s.v. cocoa). Cocoa beans are commonly used in the
preparation of various delicacies and are responsible for the brown colour of such
products as chocolate. The word cocoa is further used as a description of colour; “[a]
shade of brown similar to the colour of cocoa beans or cocoa powder” (OED).
The labels Hazelnut and Mahogany are both used six times for medium foundations. The
label Hazelnut shares similar characteristics with other nuts which appear in the material.
Hazelnut primarily refers to a round brown nut (OED, s.v. hazelnut. Besides referring to
either the nut itself or the tree in which it grows, hazelnut can further refer to the material
of something that has been made using that specific wood.
Mahogany primarily refers to a type of wood with a “rich reddish brown” colour (OED,
s.v. mahogany). The material, or wood from the tree, is used for making cabinets and is
viewed to be a valuable material. Furthermore, the word mahogany is the name of a
Cornish drink, which consists of gin and treacle. Since mahogany is viewed as valuable
44

Jennie Selén
it gives the word a positive connotation. However, due to its association with alcohol it
suggests a slightly more negative connotation.
Honey and Golden are both used as a label five times each. Honey was discussed in detail
in the previous section 5.3.2, since it is also a frequently used label for medium
foundations. Golden, according to OED (s.v. golden), refers to something that has been
made out of gold or related to gold. In a figurative sense, golden refers to something rather
valuable and precious. Additionally, OED defines golden as “a period of time, a season,
etc.: characterized or typified by gold or yellow hues; esp. characterized by sunshine;
warm and sunny”. Since the word golden is associated with value, the sun and warmth, it
has positive connotations.
The labels Beige, Brown, Cinnamon, Maple, Sable and Truffle have all been used as labels
for four products each. Since Beige is a frequently used label for both light and medium
foundations, its connotations have been discussed in section 5.3.1.
The primary definition of the word brown is that it is a colour (OED, s.v. brown).
Therefore, the word brown is used to describe different objects or elements that have a
brown colour. In addition to this, brown is associated with earthiness and therefore
perhaps also with a certain calmness (OED). Moreover, brown can be associated with dirt
which does add a slightly negative connotation. Brown can also be used to describe “[a]
person of brown complexion; a brunette (obsolete). In later use, a mulatto” (OED).
The word cinnamon refers to a spice which comes from “[the] inner bark of an East Indian
tree” and “is of a characteristic yellowish brown colour” (OED, s.v. cinnamon).
Furthermore, M-W (s.v. cinnamon) provides two colour definitions for the word
cinnamon. Cinnamon is defined as a “tan to dark brown spice” and also as having a “light
yellowish-brown” colour. The colour descriptions here are quite interesting. It is apparent
that there may be some variation in the way the colour of cinnamon is perceived and
described. This is most likely the reason why its use in the marketing of makeup products
also varies. Furthermore, cinnamon tends to be associated with seasonal flavours, such as
autumn or with more festive seasons like Christmas or Thanksgiving. It is common for
cafés for example to add cinnamon flavour to their products such as to cakes and drinks
during these times. This could be linked with a positive and festive association.
45

Jennie Selén

Maple refers to a tree which can be found in Eurasia and is known to grow in “north
temperate regions” (OED, s.v. maple). The tree is usually “grown for shade or ornament,
for timber, or for syrup” (OED). Maple is quite naturally associated with “[the] lightbrown colour of maple wood” (OED). There are various products which can be made
either from the wood of the maple or from the sap or syrup, which is an additional product
that the tree produces. From the wood furniture and similar products are made, and
various consumables can be made by using the syrup. In the US and especially in Canada,
it is common to put maple syrup on pancakes, for example.
The word sable is defined as used in “[heraldry]” according to OED (s.v. sable) and is
associated with “[the] colour black; black clothing”. Sable is defined as “[black], as one
of the heraldic colours” and is associated with “blackness” and “darkness”. Sable is also
viewed as “a symbol of mourning” and is commonly used in poetry in reference to
“[mourning] garments; a suit of black worn as an emblem of grief”. Furthermore, Sable
is also associated with the animal “sable antelope” which can be found in Africa (OED).
Lastly, sable can be used as an adjective for describing “material objects, persons,
animals, etc.” and was earlier on used as a way of mocking or ridiculing people of black
ethnicity by saying “his sable majesty” and was to some extent even tied together to the
devil (OED). This suggest that the word sable has negative associations.
The word truffle refers to “[a] type of confectionery”, which tends to be quite small in
size and have a round form (OED, s.v. truffle). The ingredients used to make a truffle are
cream and chocolate. It is rather common to add alcohol, like rum for example, to the
mixture when making a truffle with the purpose of adding some flavour. Truffles are
usually rolled in cocoa powder to make a nice garnish. The word truffle may be seen to
have positive connotations in the sense that it is usually used for finer occasions.
5.4

Modifiers

Since there are quite a few words which appear several times as modifiers, it is important
that these modifiers are additionally examined and discussed since they do in fact play an
essential role. The modifier’s task is to help describe the shade of the foundation in more
detail. One example of how skin colours can differ is that they have different undertones

46

Jennie Selén
such as cool, warm or neutral (Paula’s Choice, 2020). According to Paula’s Choice (2020)
if the skin colour has cool undertones it refers to “[hints] of bluish, pink, or a ruddy
complexion”, and if the skin colour has warm undertones it usually indicates that the
“[skin] skews yellow, sallow, peachy, or golden”. Lastly, if the skin colour has neutral
undertones it simply means that the skin “has no obvious overtones of pink or sallow skin,
but rather the skin’s natural colour is more evident” (Paula’s Choice, 2020).
Table 14 shows the distribution of the most frequently used modifiers.

Firstly, we will examine the distribution of the modifiers which are also commonly used
as head words. The meanings of these head words have already been presented in the
analysis section in 5.3. Therefore, the focus here is on the distribution of the modifiers
within the different categories. The modifier Golden is used for 23 products. Golden is
only used four times for lighter shades of foundations, 16 times as a modifier for medium
foundations and three times for darker foundations.
The modifier Medium is altogether used 17 times. In all occurrences, Medium appears as
a modifier for medium shades of foundations. Medium is used considerably more times
as a modifier compared to the five times it appears as a head word. Next is Natural which
appears as a modifier 10 times. Natural is used as a modifier three times for light shades,
six times for medium shades and once for a dark foundation. The division is split and
tallies with the distribution of Natural as a product name, where it is used mostly for the
purpose of describing products categorised as light or medium shade foundations.
47

Jennie Selén

The next modifiers are Light and Fair. Light is used for nine products in total and Fair is
used as a modifier for six products. The modifiers are both used in a similar manner,
meaning that all occurrences are for light foundations, which is exactly the same as when
these are used as head words. However, there is one exception: light does appear as a
modifier once for a dark shade.
The following frequently used modifiers are words which have not earlier been discussed
in the analysis section on head words. The most frequent of these modifiers is Warm,
which is used 47 times. The modifier Warm is used evenly for the different shades,
namely 17 times for light foundations, 18 times for medium foundations and 12 times for
dark foundations. Even though the number of occurrences is rather even, it is worth noting
that the modifier is used slightly more for light and medium foundations. Warm primarily
refers to something “[having] a fairly high temperature; affording or giving out a
considerable degree of heat” (OED, s.v. warm). Additionally, warm refers to the body
and blood of a human or any living organism (OED). Warm is also associated with
“tenderness or affection” (OED).
The modifier Cool appears 23 times altogether. Out of the 23 times, Cool is used as a
modifier nine times for light foundations, six times for medium shades and the remaining
eight times for dark foundations. In addition to being used as a modifier, Cool does appear
as a head word once. OED (s.v. cool) primarily defines cool as referring to the weather,
as “[a] cool breeze, a light and refreshing wind”. It is difficult to determine whether the
word cool has positive or negative connotations. Considering the definitions, the word
appears rather neutral.
Deep appears as a modifier for 13 products. Deep is used once for a medium shade and
the remaining twelve times for dark shades. One meaning of deep is a sort of measurement
of the depth of something, such as the sea (OED s.v. deep). Additionally, it is used for
describing different states, such as deep sleep, and furthermore for indicating that
something is “[placed] or situated far (or a specified distance) down or beneath the
surface; of a ship, low in the water” (OED). If referring to colours, deep usually indicates
that the colour is a darker shade.

48

Jennie Selén
Dark appears as a modifier ten times, out of which it is used once for a light shade and
the remaining seven times for dark shades. Dark symbolises the “[absence] of light”
(OED, s.v. dark). The word dark is also associated with “a place of darkness”, or with
“darkness of the night” (OED). Additionally, OED defines dark to be used for describing
“blood or race”, meaning that the word is used to describe people with a darker skin
colour. Lastly, dark can refer to the temper of a person which have negative associations
such as that a person is “[clouded] with anger or dislike” (OED).
Finally, the modifier Neutral appears twice as a modifier for light shades, three times for
medium shades and four times for dark shades. The word neutral is associated with “[a]
person or state remaining neutral in a controversy, dispute, war, etc., or a ship belonging
to a neutral state, etc.” (OED, s.v. neutral). Neutral refers to something which is in the
middle or “[not] belonging to, associated with, or favouring any party or side” (OED).
Neutral is additionally used in different settings for example as a term which is used in
chemistry, where it indicates that particular “substance or species” are “chemically
neutral”. Additionally, neutral is a term which is used within other fields such as physics
and astronomy, and also when talking about electricity. The word has a similar purpose
within this field of indicating for example that “an atom or molecule, that has no electrical
charge” (OED). Neutral is furthermore associated with “[a] neutral colour or shade, esp.
a brown, cream, or grey; (hence) a colour or shade regarded as unobtrusively
complementing other colours in a colour scheme. Also: spec. an achromatic shade or
tone” according to the OED.
5.5

Cosmetic companies with a distinct categorization system

In this section, the focus is on the cosmetic companies which have a labelling system that
differs from the others, namely NARS Cosmetics, Revolution Beauty and Fenty Beauty.
What sets NARS apart is the company’s practice of naming their products after physical
locations. The other two cosmetic companies, Revolution Beauty and Fenty Beauty, in
turn, use numbers as labels for their foundations. These have not been included in the
analysis section as such since the labels that they use cannot be further analysed in the
scope of this thesis.

49

Jennie Selén
NARS Cosmetics solely uses place names as labels for their foundations and while their
system may be intriguing, it can also be viewed as problematic. For example, not all
people coming from Siberia, which is the label for the lightest colour, might in fact choose
the lightest shade as their foundation, as every woman within that specific region and
outside is different and might choose another foundation shade. The idea to label the
foundations based on places or locations is certainly creative, although it might not be the
best or most appropriate way of naming products. There is likely to be a lot of diversity
between women and their skin colour today, regardless of the place in question. However,
one might also argue that choosing Siberia as a name for their lightest shade refers more
to the climate in Siberia than its people; snow being predominant in the area and being
white in colour.
Revolution Beauty and Fenty Beauty share the same labelling system of their products
which is by using numbers. Both cosmetic companies solely use numbers rather than
names to label their different shades of foundations. Revolution Beauty has a selection of
24 whose shades are split evenly between the three different shade categories. In
comparison, Fenty Beauty has been praised for its wide range of different shades to
choose from. When Fenty Beauty launched its first range of foundations in 2017, it
consisted of 40 different shades (Schallon, 2018). Fenty Beauty’s goal was to provide a
foundation suitable for everyone, regardless of skin colour. Therefore, the creator of the
label, Rihanna, made it her personal mission to see her idea through and employed
scientists who spent a long time researching and creating what turned out to become 40
different shades of foundations.

Discussion

This chapter begins by discussing the selection of products for each of the shade
categories, followed by a reflection of the different main categories. Thereafter, the
similarities and differences between the labels are explored. To provide a brief overview,
it is possible to note that even though the labelling practices remain quite consistent
between companies, some differences do exist.
The label distribution for each of the three shade categories is quite uneven and we may
note that most of the products included are medium in shade, which is slightly surprising.
As predicted, there is the lowest number of products categorised as dark foundations. My
hypothesis was that the majority of the labels would have been of a light shade of
foundation due to clear bias in society throughout history and to some extent even at
present. It appears, however that the trend has indeed moved away from having a palelooking skin towards one which appears as somewhat sun-kissed.
6.1
6.1.1

Trends in labelling foundations
Categories

The identified labels are very diverse, suggesting that cosmetic companies have certainly
drawn inspiration from an array of different objects and elements when naming their
products. It is also intriguing how different categories are used for different shade
categorisations. There is observable variation in the way the companies have drawn on
language in their branding. A very noticeable difference is the distribution of the different
products in the category “consumables”. There is a considerably higher number dark than
light or medium foundations in this category.
The distribution of the products in the category “colour” is not even. Most of the labels
in this category are of medium foundations. However, the difference between medium
and light foundations is considerably smaller in comparison to the number of medium
products and dark products. Even though there are the least products in this category for
dark foundations, the number of different labels is higher for dark shades than for the
other two shade categories.

51

Jennie Selén
Most of the labels within the category “materials” are light foundations. This suggest that
using words related to materials is a common way of labelling products of a light shade.
There are some medium foundations which fall into this category, but no dark
foundations.
Furthermore, the category “skin colours” mostly consists of products which are light
foundations. This is the category one might expect the largest selection of products to fall
into, since the category consists of words specifically relating to skin colour. The products
are meant to be applied to the skin, therefore using labels referring to skin tones seem
appropriate. There are less products of a medium shade but still considerably more than
the number of dark shades. Why are there only a handful of labels for products of a dark
shade? This suggests that finding labels which refer to skin colours is easier for light
shades than what it is for dark shades.
Most of the products which belong to the category “animals” are light foundations. There
are almost three times as many light products with animal labels than medium or dark
ones. What is the underlying reason for the cosmetic companies to choose animals as
names for their products, and why are the majority of the names given to lighter shades?
Allegedly, the reason may be that parallels can drawn between some of the colours of the
different animals used as labels, and with the colour of the human skin. While some
people might find it charming to have a foundation called Fawn, others might not
appreciate being colour matched with a foundation labelled Sable.
The two categories “numbers” and “places” are similar in that they have unique labels for
each product. Medium foundations are the most numerous in both categories. There is an
observable difference in the number of products in the category “numbers”, but the
difference is not as remarkable as the variation of the products available for each shade
category in the category “places”. The category “Places” consists of considerably fewer
products for light and dark shades of foundations than for medium ones.
The category “decorations” consist mostly of light foundations. There are considerably
less products within this category for medium and dark foundations. This suggest that
light foundations more often carry labels with associations to precious and decorative

52

Jennie Selén
elements. Why is this the case? Surely, there could be more labels referring to decorations
for medium and dark foundations.
There are no labels for light foundations that belong to the categories “scale” or “metals”.
These two categories are small in size, but nevertheless, cosmetic companies have still
opted to name their products with labels falling into this category. The reason why there
are no labels for light shades of foundations belonging to this category could be that
metals in particular are not “light” in colour. Although, arguably, if Copper, Bronze and
Golden can be used as labels for medium and darker shades, why is Silver for example
not used for light foundations?
Lastly, the categories “nature” and “temperature” are also similar when taking a look at
the distribution of products of each of the three different shade categories, which are quite
equal. Medium foundations are the most numerous in the category “nature”, however
even though there are less products belonging to the other two shade categories, the
difference is not that distinct. It is interesting that cosmetic companies have decided to
use labels referring to nature for their products. It may be a source of inspiration, however
some labels in this category definitely have more positive connotations while others have
more negative ones. Moreover, the category “temperature” is very small in size but is
equal in the sense that it consists of roughly the same number of products for each of the
three different shade categories.
6.1.2

Similarities

LIGHT SHADES OF FOUNDATIONS
There are some visible patterns when it comes to examining similarities for the frequently
used labels for light shades of foundations. The labels Ivory, Porcelain and Alabaster are
all associated with decorative and valuable materials. Decorative and valuable
associations seem to be an emerging theme for the most frequently used light labels.
Additionally, the label Fair mostly has positive connotations and is primarily associated
with beauty. One of the labels which does not comply with this particular pattern is,
Vanilla, which is one of the few labels that do not carry decorative or beauty associations.
The reason why Vanilla is used as a label for light foundations might be in reference to
the flower which grows alongside the pod, which is of a white-yellowish colour. Vanilla

53

Jennie Selén
is often used as a scent, which usually has a softness to it and may be considered a positive
connotation. However, the word vanilla can be associated with describing something
which is plain. Therefore, the label Vanilla may be viewed as having slightly negative
and somewhat dull connotations.
The reason why cosmetic companies have opted to use Light both as a label and for the
shade category might be since both are very straightforwardly descriptive of the quality
of the product. Nevertheless, the label Light is rather problematic when considering its
connotations. On the one hand, the word light mostly has positive connotations, but on
the other hand, it can also be interpreted as slightly negative. While the word light is
associated with warmth, as also discussed in the analysis, the word can refer to lack of
colour.
The label Nude ought to be a suitable label for a foundation as it refers to the skin colour,
or when someone is unclothed, or in their own true natural colour. Arguably, some people
might want the foundation to exactly match their skin colour, meaning that it covers the
skin but still looks natural, while some others may use it to alter their own skin colour.
Moreover, if the aim of a Nude foundation is to match the skin colour exactly, the label
is slightly problematic since nude is not the same colour for each and every single person.
Consequently, this can cause some dissatisfaction if some foundations have the label
Nude and others do not. People might dislike mismatched labels because of the fact that
such labels claim to represent a standard which the person’s skin colour does not meet.
Furthermore, the only label that could be viewed as having a rather negative connotation
for lighter shades is Pale. The word Pale is usually used in reference to a person who is
either ill, or simply because there is a loss of colour in their face or cheeks. It does not
really have any positive connotation to it at all, despite the fact that it can be categorised
as being light. Referring to someone as being Pale usually functions as an indicator to
signal that something is wrong. It is also interesting how the connotation of the word pale
has changed over time. In history, pale was an ideal, something that everyone desired
and, as discussed in chapter 3, used various methods and recipes to try and achieve. The
issue with the word pale is that it has conflicting connotations, which might render it as
a risky choice for a label. Moreover, it might be the case that the word is only applied to

54

Jennie Selén
foundations marketed towards white consumers, who are consequently differently
affected by the various connotations of the word.
There are some visible patterns for the modifiers used for light foundations. The modifiers
Warm and Fair both have rather positive connotations, while the modifier Cool is slightly
more complex. Warm is the literal symbol for warmth which has a positive connotation.
Fair is associated with beauty and is therefore also positive. Generally speaking, the label
cool is rather neutral, but when looking at the connotations, there are both positive and
some more negative ones, depending of course on the context in which the word is used.
MEDIUM SHADES OF FOUNDATIONS
There are also some visible similarities for the frequently used labels for medium
foundations. The labels Sand, Honey and Buff are all described as referring to a yellowishbrown colour. The labels which belong to the medium shade categorisation tend to
implicate that the colour of the product is brown, commonly also slightly yellow. The
usage of words which have a brown and slightly yellow colour as labels, may refer to
certain undertones in the skin, meaning that the skin has slightly yellow or golden
pigments. Furthermore, in some instances, the words are described as having a golden
colour, which again leads to the question of whether this is positive or negative?
Supposedly, one might think that golden at least has a more positive connotation than
negative since it may suggest that it is also valuable.
The label Buff is interesting when considering its connotations. The reason why Buff is
used as a label is most likely since it can be associated with a colour, but the cosmetic
companies ought to consider the other connotations the word has. The word buff is for
example also associated with bodybuilding and buffalos, as discussed in the analysis.
These connotations do not imply any sense of positivity and are perhaps not associated
with beauty either.
There are some consumables used as labels for medium foundations, such as the labels
Caramel and Toffee for example. One observation as to why these have been used as
labels for medium foundations can be since they all have a sort of light brown to brownish
colour. Some users might find it desirable to have the label of their foundation being a
55

Jennie Selén
sweet, but again, others might not want their skin colour to be defined as a consumable.
To have consumables as labels may have fewer positive connotations in the sense that
they refer to colloquial everyday notions, which might be viewed as slightly dull and
without any value.
The label Medium seems like a logical choice of a label for foundations also categorised
as a medium shade. This is also supported by the fact that the word medium usually refers
to the medium of a scale, and that medium shades is the middle shade category out of the
three. Moreover, from one point of view medium is a rather neutral word, which means
that the connotations are also neutral. From another viewpoint the word medium suggests
a middle ground and could therefore be interpreted as the ‘norm’ or ‘normal’. However,
skin colours do not have a normal or a neutral but vary dramatically from person to
person.
The label Tan is rather problematic. On one hand, Tan is certainly not neutral and would
suggest that the so called ‘natural’ skin colour of a person has been altered or affected by
the sun. On the one hand it appears as if the starting point, or the norm, is light skin, to
which the other shades are compared. Today it is to some extent a trend to sunbathe or
cosmetically alter one’s skin colour with products to make the skin colour darker.
Sometimes it is viewed as a status symbol of having money and being able to travel and
return with sun-kissed skin colour.
The most frequently used modifiers for medium foundations are Warm, Golden and
Medium. These three modifiers are used considerably more compared to the other
modifiers. This suggest that it is common to have a modifier preceding the head word for
foundations categorised as medium. The modifiers suggest that the medium shades of
foundations have warm undertones, and perhaps some hints of yellow undertones based
on their definitions. The words warm and golden have positive connotations as already
mentioned and the word medium appears rather neutral on the one hand, but on the other
hand perhaps slightly negative.

56

Jennie Selén
DARK SHADES OF FOUNDATIONS
A clear pattern for the dark foundation labels is that most of the labels are consumables.
The labels Mocha and Espresso both refer to types of coffee, with mocha being somewhat
lighter and espresso darker in colour. It can be questioned if women appreciate cosmetic
companies are calling the foundation which best suits them Espresso or Mocha. There
are hardly any products of a light shade with labels referring to coffee, so why are there
so many dark ones? Words related to coffee, such as espresso and mocha can be seen
rather plain and common and usually not associated with beauty related notions either.
Furthermore, there is the label Cocoa, whose appropriateness can also be questioned. The
word cocoa has similar associations as the labels Espresso and Mocha in the sense that it
too, is not regarded as glamourous, but as something which is rather common and
simplistic.
Besides coffee, nuts appear as a common way of labelling foundations aimed for women
with a darker skin colour. The label Chestnut is particularly interesting since the two
dictionaries define the word as primarily a nut, but that it is also used to describe a colour
of a horse. Using a label defined as referring to a colour of a horse may not be the most
suitable choice to name a foundation. The labels Walnut and Hazelnut also have similar
connotations to those of chestnut, at least when speaking of the colour description. Since
there are four words which refer to nuts that are frequently used as labels, one can ask
whether it should be viewed as a positive or negative thing to draw parallels between
someone’s skin and a nut?
The labels Cinnamon and Truffle also refer to consumables. Cinnamon is associated with
earthiness and calmness, which again can be a symbol for warmth. This suggest a positive
connotation, as does the scent of cinnamon, which conveys pleasantness and
peacefulness. The label Truffle is associated with a confectionery. Truffle can be
interpreted as having positive associations in the sense that it is sometimes considered as
a type of luxury treat, however, it too has rather simplistic and colloquial connotations.
The labels Amaretti and Spiced Rum are interesting and very surprising choices of labels.
The underlying reasons for why cosmetic companies have opted for labels referring to
alcoholic beverages and consider them are suitable would be interesting to know.
57

Jennie Selén
Arguably, one could say that alcohol is expensive, meaning that it is also valuable.
However, alcohol is perhaps not viewed as having positive connotations and may not be
suitable choices for cosmetic products.
Consumables aside, some of the labels used for darker shades of foundation are also
nature-related, or tree-related to be more specific, such as the labels Mahogany and
Maple. There is one label, Aspen which is for a light foundation and another label, Auburn
for a medium foundation, but why are the most labels referring to trees used for dark
foundations? It is very interesting that labels which refer to trees have been chosen as
labels for foundations. It might be that nature has been a source for inspiration for the
names of the labels, but it is slightly odd to use trees as names for cosmetic products.
Trees are commonly weathered and associated with roughness which presumably is the
opposite of what a consumer want their skin to look like or be associated with.
There are labels which refer to colours, like the labels Beige, Brown or Dark Brown for
example. However, labels defined primarily as colours are the fewest in numbers for
darker foundations. In most cases where a word related to either a skin colour or a colour
is used, there tends to be a premodifier that emphasises the fact that the colour is in fact
dark. The fact that there appears to be a need for an indicator preceding the head word
may be viewed as slightly negative.
Furthermore, the label with the most negative connotation is Sable, which mostly has
negative connotations. Sable is associated with mourning, sadness, and darkness which
does not really sound like a suitable label for a product whose task is supposed to make
women feel more self-confident and beautiful, at least considering the way in which
cosmetic companies market their products.
The most frequently used modifiers for the dark shades of foundations are Dark and Deep.
These modifiers are used to indicate that it is a darker shade of a specific shade of
foundation. It is interesting that the frequent modifiers here are Dark and Deep, while the
frequently used modifiers for light shades are Warm and Fair. This suggests that there is
a need to emphasise just how dark the shade of a certain product is. On the contrary, it
appears as if there is no need to emphasise, or at least not to the same extent, if a shade is
Light. In a few instances Very and Ultra are used as modifiers to describe that a shade is
58

Jennie Selén
for example Ultra Deep or Very Dark. Even though there is one label which is called
Ultra Light it does not appear as common to emphasise light shades. For light shades
companies instead use the labels Porcelain and Ivory.
6.1.3

Frequencies across categories

It is interesting that some labels have been used for two, if not all three shade categories.
The most frequently used label is Beige. The label is used for foundations of all three
shades, but far less frequently for dark than light or medium foundations. Even though
Beige is listed as being a colour, is it suitable for describing a product meant for matching
the skin colour of the individual using it? Perhaps it is the closest one can get when
attempting to define the colour of skin. Beige does have some slightly negative
connotations since it can be viewed as bland and somewhat dull.
Furthermore, Natural is used as a label for light, medium and darker shades of
foundations. However, light shades of foundations tend to be described as Natural more
frequently compared to the two other shade categories (medium and dark). Natural is
only used as a label once as a head word and once as a modifier for darker shades of
foundations, which is why it is not listed among the most frequently used labels for darker
shades of foundations. Since Natural refers to something occurring naturally, meaning
that it is not artificially made but it is pure as nature itself, it seems to be a suitable label.
But why is the label used considerably more for lighter shades compared to medium and
darker shades of foundations? The usage of the label Natural suggest that light shades are
more natural compared to the two other shades and depict them as somewhat unnatural.
This implies primarily for dark foundations witch barely has any labels containing the
word natural either as a head word nor as a modifier. Is it not simply the case that all skin
colours are natural? In effect, the fact that the label Natural appears more frequently for
lighter shades of foundations gives a clear message that lighter skin is more natural than
medium or darker skin. Is this an appropriate message for a makeup product to convey?
Another interesting label is Almond, which is used as a label for all three shade categories,
but it is used less frequently for medium shades of foundations. The reason why it is used
as a label for all three shade categories can be arguably be that an almond basically has
three different colours: the shell of the nut, the unpeeled nut, and the peeled nut. Perhaps

59

Jennie Selén
the lighter shades refer to the inside of an almond, referring to the peeled nut, which tends
to be of a lighter colour compared to the colour of the shell or the unpeeled nut. The shell
of the nut could be what cosmetic companies refer to when giving medium shades of
foundations the label Almond. The dark shades could then be considered to refer to the
unpeeled nut that is defined as being of a darker colour. It is very complicated then if
someone is coloured-matched and told that their skin-tone is Almond since it refers to
several different colours depending on which part of the Almond is referred to.
The label Bisque is frequently used for light and medium shades of foundations. Bisque
has several very distinctive meanings not to mention that the colour appears to be orange.
Neither one of the dictionaries provide a thorough colour description for the word bisque,
but when searching for bisque online, the colour of the soup appears to be moderately
orange, beige and sometimes even slightly reddish. Orange is not commonly associated
with a skin colour. The label Bisque conveys simplicity and simple associations similarly
to the other labels related to consumables.
Sand is another label which is used frequently for both light and medium shades. The
label is described as referring to the type of mineral which can be found for example on
the beach. Sand is defined as being of a brown colour with yellow pigments. Perhaps the
reason it is used as a label for both light and medium shades could be that the different
cosmetic companies refer to different colours of sand. The word sand may be associated
with a vacation which suggests a positive connotation and could symbolise calmness in a
sense. From another perspective sand might be viewed as dull, dry and invaluable and
could be associated with a remote desert and ageing.
The labels Golden and Amber are frequently used for medium and darker shades of
foundations. The label Golden carries a positive connotation since it is associated with
value. One might question whether there is a distinction between Golden and Gold. The
reason as to why cosmetic companies see Golden as a suitable label, might be to describe
a slightly darker skin colour, which is said to be Golden, or sun kissed. The label Amber
can be viewed as a precious and valuable material since it is used to make jewellery. Since
both the labels Golden and Amber are associated with value, it may suggest that cosmetic
companies label products after these since they also consider that some skin colours are
associated with value.
60

Jennie Selén

Honey is also a frequently used label for medium and dark foundations. Honey has both
positive and negative associations. The word honey is usually associated with sweetness,
and delight. Additionally, as also stated in the analysis, honey can function as a nickname
for a loved one. This suggests positive connotations. However, due to that the primary
meaning of honey is that it is a consumable, it may imply slightly negative connotations.
Usually, in these cases which a label is used for two or three of the three shade categories,
a modifier tends to precede the head word. Therefore, even if the modifiers are unique for
the different shade categories, they are still used in a similar manner, meaning as a
specifier or with a descriptive purpose. The modifier does have an impact on the head
word in that its meaning can be specified due to it. Regardless, it is very interesting that
the same labels are used for different shade categories. Perhaps the cosmetic companies
have a different idea of what colour, respectively what connotations certain labels have.
What else could be the reason as to why one label is used for different shade categories?
6.1.4

Differences

There are a few differences when it comes to what labels the cosmetic companies have
opted for and how the labels are used. It is worth reflecting on the cosmetic companies
whose labelling systems differ. Altogether, there are three cosmetic companies who label
their products in a distinctive manner. One cosmetic company which quite clearly stands
out is NARS Cosmetics who have, as also previously mentioned, opted for labelling their
foundations after different physical places. Their selection of the labels reaches all the
way from Siberia which is the lightest shade to Trinidad-Tobago, which is the darkest
shade that they offer.
The perhaps most radical difference concerning all labels is that there are two cosmetic
companies, Revolution and Fenty Beauty, who solely use numbers as labels for their
foundations. Reid (2018) observes that the cosmetic companies who have opted to use
numbers as labels for their foundations are applauded by consumers. Even though a
number might not be the most interesting label, it is usually rather neutral and does not
carry any positive or negative connotations as such.

Summary

It is worth noting that even though some labels are shared by different shade categories,
there is a clear distinction between the different shade categories. Light foundations tend
to have labels which all mostly have positive connotations. The labels are associated with
either decorative material or products or consist of words whose meanings are associated
with beauty or fairness. Additionally, the meanings of the words such as porcelain or
ivory tend to be considered as either delicate or precious as well as of high value. This is
a common theme throughout all the labels for light foundations.
Of course, there are some labels which primary meaning is not necessarily considered to
be of high value or decorative, such as the labels Vanilla or Light. Nevertheless, the
overall picture is that the use of valuables and precious, beautiful objects mostly occur as
labels for light foundations. Furthermore, the label Pale is problematic since it can be
associated with the ideal of having a pale complexion which has been a goal in history.
However, the word pale does have negative connotations since it is commonly used to
describe a person who lacks colour in their cheeks. The word pale is usually used with
the purpose of indicating that a person is ill.
Based on the analysis of medium shades of foundations, it is possible to conclude that
there is a diverse usage of labels for this shade category. Labels include words referring
to colours, consumables, skin colour and scale for example. Perhaps this highlights that
it is slightly more complicated for cosmetic companies to find suitable labels for medium
shades of foundations. Overall, the labels frequently used for medium shades of
foundations have positive or neutral connotations. However, even if the majority of the
connotations might be positive or at least neutral, the labels still fail to add the sense of
value, as the connotations of the labels do for the lighter shades of foundations.
The most frequently used labels for dark shades of foundations seem to be even more
difficult to determine. This is shown by the number of unique labels for dark foundations
is much higher in comparison to the other two shade categories. Most of the labels for
dark foundations are consumables. Could the reason for this be that the cosmetic
companies have drawn inspirations of products originating from areas where the majority
of the population has a dark skin colour? Products such as coffee and cocoa can be viewed

62

Jennie Selén
as originating in exotic places which may suggest that they are viewed as “the other” and
the “unknown”. There is a problem with this since it therefore also suggests that darker
skin colours would be associated with these notions. The labels for dark foundations have
more negative connotations in comparison to the other two shade categories. There are
few labels which add a sense of value. Most labels convey unglamorous and simplistic
associations.
The modifiers are more equally distributed in the sense that many of them have the same
descriptive words which are also used for the purpose of defining what undertones a
person’s skin has. The modifiers are also used with the purpose of describing to which
shade category the product belongs. This can be helpful in determining the colour, but
the words light and dark do come with their connotations. The word light generally has
more positive connotations in comparison to the word dark which have an impact on the
associations with the labels and products. The modifiers’ task appears to be to describe
the undertones for light and medium foundations, while their task for darker shades of
foundations is to simply state that the foundation is dark in colour.

Conclusion

“Though continuously reinforced throughout life via the media, most Blacks are
somewhat acculturated, from a very young age to believe in the notion that he or she is,
or at the very least will be, better off if they are light-skinned” (Harrison and ReynoldsDubbs, 2009: 254). Even at present white skin is considered to be the favourable skin
colour and the ideal, while people with darker skin tend to be neglected. Every day we
see stereotypes reinforced in the media, in advertisements, and in films.
In history it was ideal, or a desire to have light, fair or alabaster skin. Today it is rather
common for a person with white skin colour to use products to make their skin colour
somewhat darker. This trend started in the 20th century (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 282).
While some people decide to embrace their natural skin colour others will not. As of
recently, during the last decade or so, it has become a trend to use fake-tan and bronzers
to make the skin appear tanned (Kenway and Bullen, 2011: 281). Tanning beds are of
course not eliminated either, and even though using them regularly can have negative
impact on the health and possibly even result in cancer, they still seem to attract people.
The trend is to appear as one who has travelled and for the skin to simply look “sun
kissed”. Altering one’s skin colour, whether it is to make it appear lighter or more tanned,
has proven to have negative impacts on the health.
As seen, it appears as if colour labels are difficult to describe, not to mention even more
complex to define. With that said, it seems as if skin colour is even more challenging and
even more precarious. A perfect terminology which would be approved by everyone and
would be equal towards everyone seems yet to be discovered. However, establishing
labels which would be more appropriate and more equal ought to be a reasonable request.
It does seem peculiar that the cosmetic companies themselves do not see the problem in
naming a foundation intended for someone with a light skin colour Porcelain or Fair,
whereas the foundations indented for someone with darker skin is Sable or Mocha. The
cosmetic companies have certainly been creative in their attempt to find suitable labels
for their foundations, but the meanings of the labels are not equal.
Moreover, there is a clear marketing issue which should also be highlighted: the cosmetic
companies’ task is to find suitable labels, with the purpose of promoting sales, but also to

64

Jennie Selén
provide labels which are memorable. If the foundation has a memorable label which is
appreciated by the customer, they are likely to remember it and purchase it again. Perhaps
the labels are not that important to everyone; some people might not give them that much
consideration, but there has been negative criticism towards the labels of the darker
foundations, which suggests that the labels do play an important role.
It is rather difficult to further speculate, but perhaps the labels do not concern people
using the light foundations since the labels within that category are often associated with
valuable and precious objects or materials. However, the goal is to appeal to and please
the customer. Despite the common saying, “no PR is bad PR”, being accused of
discarding ethnic diversity does not help the company’s reputation. It ought to be
favourable for the companies to consider ethnic diversity in their advertisements and
appeal to every consumer (Sierra, Hyman and Heiser, 2012: 506-507).
Furthermore, the results of this thesis highlight the division of labels between the
categories: some categories have several labels for each shade category, while there also
are certain categories which consist mostly of one specific shade of foundation. It is
interesting that some companies have similar labels for different shades, while others
have completely different labels for products belonging to different shade categories.
Additionally, it is clear that there are the fewest products and the highest number of
unique labels for dark foundations, and the least variation for light shades of foundations.
This suggests that the labels used for light shades of foundations are mostly the same
labels.
Most of the labels that are used are quite complex when considering their connotations.
The darker shades of foundations are particularly difficult as stated previously. Women
with dark skin would prefer other labels than always being referred to as coffee or nuts
(Fleming, 2019). Is it simply an accident or coincidence that labels for lighter shades of
foundations tend to be associated with precious, beautiful and valuable things, while
darker colours have labels which are tied together with less valuable objects? One could
argue that consumables such as Truffle or labels which refer to alcoholic beverages, such
as Amaretti, could be seen as words associated with value, but these words still do not
measure up to the valuable and precious names as Porcelain and Ivory based on their
connotations. Regardless, cosmetic companies ought to have the intention of being
65

Jennie Selén
objective and impartial and pay attention to diversity in skin colour. All the labels could
be seen as described or viewed from a white person’s perspective; as seen, all the labels
that are Nude or Natural are primarily given to products categorised as light foundations.
All the labels for light products are associated with decorative, valuable and pretty objects
and materials, while medium and especially darker shades are associated with
consumables, specifically nuts and coffee. The findings suggest that people with white or
light skin are somehow superior and of more value than people of a different skin colour.
Even though change and improvements have been made in the cosmetic industry, there
is still room for improvement both in the product range or selection as well as in the
advertisements. Prestige makeup brands add colours and expanding their collections, but
consumers remain dissatisfied (Fleming, 2019). When it is brought to the cosmetic
companies’ attention that consumers with a dark skin colour are dissatisfied about being
unable to find a suitable shade for their skin, they usually do take action. The complaints
tend to be heard and the cosmetic companies’ actions are usually to add some shades to
their selection as an attempt to provide a solution for the problem or dissatisfaction
(Fleming, 2019). However, usually the cosmetic companies add the new shades to their
selection discreetly, without advertising it anywhere or promoting it and as a
consequence, the additional shades may remain unnoticed.
Labels are very complicated, and it is important for the cosmetic companies to give more
consideration to the labels they put on their foundations. Of course, these cosmetic
companies are aimed at the Western world, which does have a large proportion of people
with a light complexion, but that does not entail that diversity should be discarded. One
underlying factor which might have some impact on the labels of the different products
might be history. This could entail entering a perhaps slightly dangerous and sensitive
territory, but it could be a reason behind the different connotations. However, it would
explain that there is still a notion present that light shades, therefore also lighter skin
colours, are regarded as more precious and of more worth than those of a darker skin
colour.
The best way to label the cosmetic products ought to be the way which two companies,
Fenty Beauty and Revolution Beauty, have done and that is by using numbers as labels.
Some people might find using numbers as labels dull, but labelling all foundations with
66

Jennie Selén
a number would be more equal. People with light skin may not mind that their skin colour
is associated with precious, valuable and beautiful objects, however, people with a darker
skin might be offended that cosmetic companies label their skin as Coconut, Hazelnut or
Espresso. To use numbers is perhaps the safest and most appropriate way; with numbers
no one should feel singled out for having a skin colour which perhaps is associated with
labels such as coffee or nuts.
As a conclusion it is possible to state that the labels of different foundations are unequal.
Cosmetic companies should give the labels they put on their foundations more
consideration. The light labels symbolise preciousness and value while the labels for dark
shades are of lesser value, consisting mostly of words related to consumables, which
make them appear unglamourous. As for further studies, one could do an even more
extensive analysis and examine even more foundations by different cosmetic companies.
It may be worth looking at different products as well such as concealers or powders and
examine their connotation. The cosmetic companies used for the purpose of this thesis
are all very Western-targeted, and therefore it might be interesting to also focus on
cosmetic companies located elsewhere. This might also be the reason why the labels for
light shades are more conventionalised and why there is much more variety of labels of
dark shades. The reason why light labels are conventionalised could be that the usage of
such products has long been a part of the Western culture and the purpose of the products
is to make the user more attractive. Of course, being attractive is associated with beauty
and beauty is associated with value.

Swedish summary - Svensk sammanfattning
”Because you’re worth it”
En studie av produktnamnen
på underlagskrämer för kvinnor
Inledning och syfte
Kosmetikaprodukter ingår som en naturlig del av många personers vardag. Utbudet av
olika kosmetikaprodukter avsedda för ansiktet är stort – det finns till exempel
ögonskuggor, ögonbrynspennor, mascaror, rouge, läppstift och puder. Eftersom utbudet
är enormt, torde det finnas något för var och en. Syftet med denna avhandling är att
undersöka vilka produktnamn kosmetikaföretag ger sina produkter. Målet är att
undersöka produktnamnen på underlagskrämer som är avsedda för olika hudfärger med
hjälp av en semantisk kategorisering. Avsikten är att undersöka vilka konnotationer
produktnamnen har och att undersöka eventuella mönster och stereotyper. Det är vanligt
att kosmetika används av både män och kvinnor, men i den här avhandlingen ligger
fokuset på de underlagskrämer som i första hand är avsedda för kvinnor.
Produktnamnen på kosmetikan avspeglar också företagets image. Kundunderlaget
speglar alla de som kan tänkas använda underlagskrämerna och samtidigt också
företagens attityder till och åsikter om dem. Det har sedan en tid tillbaka debatterats om
utbudet och produktnamnen på de produkter som finns tillgängliga på marknaden. I den
debatten har kvinnor med en mörkare hudfärg uttryckt missnöje över produkterna och hur
de har namngivits.
Marknaden erbjuder många olika underlagskrämer att välja mellan. Fokuset i den här
avhandlingen ligger på flytande underlagskrämer. En underlagskräm är alltså en
kosmetikaprodukt som används som en bas då man sminkar sig. Avsikten med den typen
av krämer är att de ska vara möjligast nära användarens egen hudfärg. Man använder sig
av underlagskrämer för att åstadkomma en jämn och slät yta som får huden att se bra ut.
I marknadsföringen framhävs produkterna som ett sätt att uppnå den bästa versionen av
sig själv. Det här innebär att företagen antyder att kvinnor ska täcka eller gömma sådant
som kan upplevas som skavanker i ansiktet.

Bakgrund
Betydelse och färger
Språkvetare har länge intresserat sig för vilka ordens egentliga innebörder är samt vilka
konnotationer ord har. Med konnotationer avses vilka innebörder eller associationer ett
ord kan ha (Murphy, 2010:33; Valenzuela 2017: 102). Ett ord kan ha många olika
konnotationer beroende på i vilket sammanhang det används och hur det uppfattas eller
upplevs av användare. Konnotationer är oftast subjektiva eftersom de baserar sig på våra
individuella upplevelser och erfarenheter (Gill, 2011:10). Vårt tankesätt fungerar som ett
symbolsystem (Valenzuela 2017: 61). Det här innebär att hur vi uppfattar, eller tolkar ett
ord, beror på tidigare uppfattningar om eller den känsla vi har för ordet. Alla ord är
neutrala från början. Hur orden upplevs och i vilken kontext de används är oftast
avgörande för om de får en positiv eller negativ konnotation.
Det har visat sig vara svårt för människor att kunna enas om vilken färg någonting har.
Ta ordet rött till exempel; enligt Gill (2011: 10) kan ordet associeras med bland annat
”blood, communism, fire, Santa Claus”. Någon kanske anser att färgen kan förknippas
med makt och varför inte också med kärlek. Poängen med detta exempel är att visa att ett
ord kan ha många olika associationer beroende på vem man frågar. Om det är svårt med
färger, torde det vara ännu mer komplicerat att bestämma hur man beskriver och
definierar hudfärger.
Kenway och Bullen (2011: 281) diskuterar den engelska termen ”colorism” som hänvisar
till då människor med en ljus hudfärg anses ha ett högre värde än människor med en
mörkare hudfärg. Detta är inget nytt fenomen utan något som fanns redan under
kolonisationen och slaveriet. Under många epoker i historien har personer med en ljus
hudfärg haft en högre status än människor som har en mörkare hudfärg. I viss mån är
detta tyvärr ännu fallet idag – trots att många strävar efter att motverka rasism och göra
samhället mer jämlikt, kräver detta ännu stora insatser.
Kosmetikans historia
Kosmetikaprodukter är inget nytt fenomen, de har funnits sedan forna tider. Att ha en ljus
och blek hy har länge varit ett ideal som kvinnor har strävat efter (Eldridge, 2015: 43–
44). Det har också länge funnits olika preparat som kvinnor har använt sig av för att uppnå
ett ideal, det vill säga en blek hy. Förr associerades en blek hy med fertilitet, god hälsa
69

Jennie Selén
och ungdomlighet (Eldridge, 2015: 42–44). Ytterligare var en blek hy anknuten till en
högre social klass (Eldridge, 2015: 63; Kenway och Bullen, 2011: 283). Kvinnor som
tillhörde en högre klass tillbringade ofta majoriteten av sin tid inomhus och deras hy var
därmed minimalt utsatt för UV-strålar och de hade därför en mycket ljus och blek hy
(Eldridge, 2015: 62). Kvinnor som däremot tillhörde en lägre samhällsklass, det vill säga
arbetarkvinnor, var tvärtom konstant utomhus och ute i solen och hade därför också en
betydligt mörkare hudfärg jämfört med kvinnorna av en högre klass.
Enligt forskning har det visat sig att den fattiga kvinnans tillvägagångssätt för att uppnå
en blek hy var mycket mer skonsamt för hyn (Eldridge, 2015: 58). Ett vanligt preparat
som användes bestod av naturliga produkter som ”chickpeas, barley, almonds,
horseradish seeds, and milk” (Eldridge, 2015: 62). Välbärgade kvinnor använde sig av
arsenik för att åstadkomma en blek hy, vilket var allt annat än skonsamt för huden och
hälsan Eldridge (2015: 43).
Metod och material
Som material för denna studie har jag slumpmässigt valt ut 20 olika kosmetikaföretag
från både webbplatsen Sephora och via Google. Det enda kriteriet var att produkten skulle
vara en flytande underlagskräm. Tillsammans blev det totala antalet produktnamn 628
stycken. För att bättre kunna analysera materialet valde jag att konstruera en Exceltabell.
I Exceltabellen har jag fem olika kolumner: kosmetikaföretag, varumärke, nyans,
produktnamn och kategori. Det som alla produktnamn, oberoende av kosmetikaföretag,
har gemensamt är att de är listade från den ljusaste nyansen till den mörkaste. Samtliga
produktnamn är också namngivna med en siffra, men eftersom de alla följer samma regel
har jag valt att utesluta siffrorna eftersom det är produktnamnen som jag är intresserad
av. En del av produktnamnen har ytterligare en beskrivning av undertoner eller en mera
detaljerad beskrivning av färgen, men det skulle ha blivit allt för omfattande att också ta
med de olika beskrivningarna i denna analys.
I regel delar kosmetikaföretagen in sina underlagskrämer i tre olika nyanskategorier: ljus,
medium och mörk. Det finns vissa företag som inte gör den här indelningen och då har
jag själv kategoriserat deras produkter. Att dela in produkterna i olika nyanskategorier
underlättar analysen och gör det lättare att se om det finns eventuella mönster för vilka
produktnamn som används för en specifik kategori.

Resultat
I den svenska sammanfattningen använder jag de engelska produktnamnen eftersom
analysen är gjord på engelska. En del av produktnamnen har svenska översättningar och
liknande konnotationer på båda språken, medan andra produktnamn saknar en exakt
motsvarande översättning och därmed skiljer sig även konnotationerna på engelska och
svenska mycket från varandra.
Totalt finns det 204 produkter som är kategoriserade som ljusa underlagskrämer, 231 som
är kategoriserade som medium och 193 som är kategoriserade som mörka. För att
underlätta analysen och ge en överblick över vilka produktnamn som används för
kosmetikaprodukterna har de delats in i olika kategorier. Totalt finns det 12
huvudkategorier. De flesta produktnamnen tillhör kategorin ”consumables”, som kunde
översättas med livsmedel och som består av 196 produkter. Den näst största kategorin är
”colours”, som jag har valt att översätta med färger på svenska, och i den ingår 164
underlagskrämer. Kategorin ”nature”, som kunde översättas med natur på svenska, är
tredje störst i storlek och i denna kategori ingår 76 underlagskrämer. Kategorin
”numbers”, som kunde översättas med siffror på svenska, är den fjärde största kategorin,
och består av 73 underlagskrämer. Den femte största kategorin är ”material” som
översätts med material på svenska. I den här kategorin ingår 64 stycken underlagskrämer.
Det är viktigt att notera att produktnamnen är mångtydiga och därför hör de ibland till
flera olika kategorier, vilket i sin tur leder till att då man summerar antalet produktnamn
i alla grupper är antalet större än den egentliga mängden produktnamn som är 628. Ett
exempel på det är produktnamnet Ivory, som passar in på tre olika grupper: djur, färg och
material. Ytterligare är det värt att uppmärksamma att vissa kosmetikaföretag har ett urval
på 50 produkter, medan andra endast har en handfull produkter.
Ljusa
I analysen av de ljusa nyanserna av underlagskrämer framkom det att Beige, Ivory,
Porcelain, Vanilla, Sand, Alabaster, Light, Natural, Nude, Almond, Fair och Bisque är
de produktnamn som förekommer mest frekvent. Produktnamnen Ivory, Porcelain,
Alabaster och Fair har alla vackra, dekorativa och dyrbara konnotationer. Fair och
Alabaster är också ord som förr beskrev hur den ideala hudfärgen såg ut och utöver det
71

Jennie Selén
betyder fair, om ordet används som ett adjektiv, att någon eller något är vackert. Ett
produktnamn som bryter mönstret om att endast ha positiva och dyrbara konnotationer är
Vanilla. Enligt Oxford English Dictionary (OED) associeras begreppet Vanilla främst
med en krydda och ordet syftar på vaniljstången som är mycket mörk i sig själv. Orsaken
till att kosmetikaföretagen valt att använda ordet Vanilla som ett produktnamn kan vara
att de associerar till den ljusa blomman som växer tillsammans med vaniljstången.
Medium
De mest frekventa produktnamnen i nyanskategorin medium är Beige, Honey, Sand, Buff,
Caramel, Tan, Medium, Natural, Toffee, Amber och Bisque. Vad produktnamnen Sand,
Honey och Buff har gemensamt är att de alla beskrivs ha en brun färg, men med en gul
nyans. Detta kan förklaras med att man kan ha varma undertoner i hyn. Produktnamnet
Buff är intressant om man tar ordets konnotationer i beaktande. Ordet beskrivs som att
först och främst vara en förkortning av ordet ”buffalo”. Buffalos, det vill säga bufflar, är
ståtliga djur som finns bland annat i Nordamerika. Ytterligare beskriver ordboken
Merriam-Webster Dictionary (sökord buff) ordet Buff som så att det avser en person som
tränar och har en muskulös kropp. Det finns också en del produktnamn inom kategorin
medium som är livsmedel: Honey, Caramel, Toffee och Bisque. Konnotationerna av
produktnamnet Honey kan anses vara positiva eftersom ordet kan förknippas med
någonting sött (OED, sökord honey). Ytterligare används ordet honey som ett smeknamn
för någon man tycker om. Däremot kan konnotationerna av de ovannämnda
produktnamnen anses vara aningen negativa eftersom de associerade till livsmedel som
är vardagligt.
Mörka
I analysen av de mörka nyanserna av underlagskrämerna framkom det att Mocha,
Almond, Espresso, Walnut, Chestnut, Amber, Cocoa, Hazelnut, Mahogany, Honey,
Golden, Beige, Brown, Cinnamon, Maple, Sable och Truffle är de produktnamn som
förekommer mest frekvent. Analysen av dessa produktnamns konnotationer visar att de
är mer negativa om man jämför dem med de andra nyanserna av underlagskrämerna. De
flesta produktnamn som används för mörka underlagskrämer är förknippade med
livsmedel. De mest frekvent använda produktnamnen syftar på följande livsmedel: kaffe
och nötter. De enda produktnamnen som har mera positiva konnotationer är Amber och
Golden. Amber (OED, sökord amber), som på svenska betyder bärnsten, används ofta
72

Jennie Selén
som ett material utav vilket man gör smycken. Smycken förknippas vanligtvis med
någonting vackert och dyrbart. Golden, som på svenska översätts med ”av guld”, tyder
på att produktnamnet är avsett att syfta på någonting som är värdefullt. Ett produktnamn
som endast har negativa konnotationer är Sable. Sable har enligt OED (sökord sable)
många olika konnotationer. Ordet associeras till exempel med ett djur, men också med
mörker och ondska. Ordet användes också förr med syftet att håna en person med mörk
hudfärg.
Det är intressant att kosmetikaföretagen har använt samma produktnamn för olika
nyanskategorier. Till exempel Almond är ett produktnamn som används för produkter
inom alla tre olika nyanskategorier. Möjligen kan förklaringen till att kosmetikaföretag
valt samma produktnamn för de tre olika nyanskategorierna vara att de syftar på de olika
delarna av en mandel. Insidan av en mandel är ljus, vilket skulle vara en förklaring till att
ordet använts som ett produktnamn för ljusa underlagskrämer. En skalad mandel är
ljusbrun i färgen, vilket skulle vara en förklaring till att produktnamnet också bärs av
produkter inom nyanskategorin medium. En oskalad mandel har en mörkare brun nyans,
vilket i sin tur skulle kunna vara orsaken till att produktnamnet också används för mörkare
underlagskrämer.
Slutsats
Resultatet av analysen visar att det finns en stor skillnad mellan produktnamnen på
sminkprodukterna beroende på vem de är avsedda för. Produktnamnen på de ljusa
nyanserna av underlagskrämerna tenderar att ha konnotationer som är förknippade med
sådant som vi uppfattar som dyrbart, värdefullt och vackert. De underlagskrämer som
kategoriserats som medium har produktnamn som både är associerade med någonting
positivt och med aningen negativa begrepp. Däremot är produktnamnen på
underlagskrämer som är avsedda för kvinnor med en mörkare hudfärg vanligtvis
associerade till livsmedel, vilka kan anses att ha mer alldagliga och oglamorösa
konnotationer.
Eftersom resultatet i den här avhandlingen visar att det är svårt med en neutral
namngivning av produkterna och att produktnamnen för de tre olika nyanskategorierna
är ojämlika, så vore det viktigt för kosmetikaföretagen att omedelbart ta itu med
problemet. Det är också av största vikt att kosmetikaföretagen överväger hurdana

konnotationer produktnamnen på deras produkter har. Det bästa sättet att namnge
produkter skulle vara att slopa produktnamnen och endast använda siffror. Siffror kan
kanske anses vara tråkiga, men de är inte orättvisa mot någon, och de är oberoende av
hudfärg – de är neutrala.
