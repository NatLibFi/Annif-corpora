Title: Good Cop, Bad Cop? – An Analysis of the Evaluative Language used by the Hosts of the
True Crime Podcast Crime Junkie when Discussing Law Enforcement
Supervisor: Brita Wårvik
During the twentieth century, podcasting was introduced as a new medium for keeping people
informed as it was less restricted by time and place than e.g. radio. From the beginning, true crime,
already a popular topic in other media, has been covered in podcasts. Podcast hosts can be seen to
influence their audience in much the same manner as other media hosts do. As linguists Martin
and White present, the way speakers evaluate behavior may lead their listeners to evaluate in a
similar manner. The aim of this thesis is to study the way podcast hosts evaluate the behavior of
law enforcement, i.e. either positively or negatively.
Two analyses were conducted on seven transcribed episodes of the American true crime podcast
Crime Junkie. Corpus linguistics was used to find frequencies of lexical items for law enforcement
used by the podcast hosts. The corpus analysis was used as the starting point for the analysis of
evaluative language, which was conducted using appraisal theory with a focus on the
subcomponent judgement, exploring how law enforcement’s behavior was judged by the podcast
hosts in relation to polarity, keywords and prosodic features.
The most frequently used terms for law enforcement include police and sheriff, which suggests
that there is a difference of terms chosen by the hosts depending on the branch of law enforcement
that was discussed in the podcast episode. The hypothesis that the podcast hosts would evaluate
American law enforcement in a more negative than positive manner proved accurate. Mainly, law
enforcement was described as unreliable, dishonest and unjust, although, interestingly, they were
still seen as competent in some respects. The podcast hosts seem to show distrust in law
enforcement. Media coverage on crime has been shown to influence public perception and opinion
on crime and law enforcement, and this can be the case for podcasts as well.
The language and vocabulary used by podcast hosts can be studied from various perspectives. In
linguistics and media research, more studies need to be conducted on evaluative language by
podcast hosts to determine whether they influence their audience like other media hosts tend to do,
and whether or not this influence might affect how their listeners perceive, in this case, law
enforcement. The abundance of ‘fake news’ around the globe signifies a clear need to be able to
distinguish between reality and fiction and being aware of the media’s influence.

1. Introduction
The twenty-first century saw the introduction of a new medium of providing information and
reaching people around the globe, namely the podcast. Since its establishment in late 2004,
podcasting has steadily been growing in popularity in recent years. One of the more popular
topics featured in podcasts, according to statistics (see section 1.3.), is true crime. Having been
a popular genre for decades, if not centuries, and a popular topic of numerous non-fiction
books, documentaries, television series, and radio shows, it should come as no surprise that the
genre transitions into podcasting as the medium grow in popularity. However, with the new
medium comes a new approach to crime reporting, as podcasts’ coverage of crime differs from
other media in that it is freer, unrestricted, and often produced by non-law enforcement
professionals. This dynamic raises questions about the way true crime is reported in podcasts
and if the nature of the discussion can have an influence on podcast audiences.
In this thesis, I will analyze episodes from the American true crime podcast Crime
Junkie in an attempt to find out how law enforcement is discussed by the podcast hosts. The
focus will be on the vocabulary used to refer to law enforcement. This will then be situated in
the context of the discussion of the podcast hosts and whether or not this discussion can be
perceived as judgmental, either positively or negatively. Furthermore, this study functions as a
trial for finding out whether podcasts can be researched from a linguistic perspective in a
constructive way. This study will focus on two main aspects (1) the vocabulary used in the
podcast to refer to law enforcement, and (2) the evaluative language used by the podcast hosts
in their discussion in regard to law enforcement. Hence the study attempts to formulate answers
to two main research questions:
(i)

What are the main lexical items used to refer to law enforcement in the podcast
Crime Junkie and which lexical items are the most prominent?

(ii)

In what way is law enforcement discussed in the podcast using evaluative language?
Is the evaluation more positive or negative?

Based on my experience and interest in listening to true crime podcasts, my hypothesis is that
there will be more negative evaluation of law enforcement than positive evaluation. In addition
to the answers to these two questions, an answer to a third question will be formulated in the
discussion section, namely (iii) To what extent is law enforcement discussed that might have
1

Ellen Seppälä
an influence on the audience of the podcast? In relation to this question, I will also briefly
discuss how there is a need for researching podcasts’ influence on their audiences.
This study will apply corpus linguistics to investigate the vocabulary used in the
podcast and appraisal analysis to study the kinds of positive and/or negative attitudes and
statements in the discussion. Appraisal theory is applied in the analysis of the speakers’
attitudes (in this study the focus is on judgement) towards the subject of law enforcement in
regard to ethics and morality of human behavior.
The next sections in this study will detail background on American law enforcement
structures and a discussion of research on the media’s influence on the public; but before this,
a definition and brief overview of true crime, podcasts, and true crime podcasts is in order to
highlight the main topic of this study.
1.1. True crime
There is no simple definition of the true crime genre. Content which defines itself as true crime
often takes a real crime and “bases the subsequent content around reconstructing that crime
and engaging in sense-making around it” (Yardley et al. 2018). However, the format and style
in which this is accomplished varies considerably. Yet, true crime is not a new genre. Even
before true crime narratives appeared in film and television, the true crime genre had been
steadily increasing in popularity for decades or centuries. Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood
(1965) is seen by many as an antecedent to the modern true crime genre (Burger 2016), as it
details the 1959 gory murder of a Kansas family. However, the fascination with true crime can
be traced back to way before the 1960s.
Crime has been a fascination of the public since at least the Ancient Roman and Greek
period. Dramatists of those periods depicted crimes such as murder and adultery in their plays,
but the tragedy was not a whodunit story as much as it focused on “the nature of the crime and
in what way […] the character [was] guilty” (Tetlow 2005: 140). Hence an interest in means
and motive was apparent already then. With the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth
century, the true crime genre evolved to include publications such as pamphlets that detailed
crimes that had been committed as a way of moralizing the public (Burger 2016). Interestingly,
it is believed that the pamphlets had the adverse effect as people grew more interested in what
in a person causes them to commit a crime than seeing their criminal actions as a moral lesson
of wrong (Burger 2016). This, again, showed people’s fascination with the sociology behind
criminal deviance.
2

Ellen Seppälä
Almost five hundred years after these pamphlets introduced the public to crime
narratives, the true crime genre has developed to include non-fiction books, films and
documentaries, television series, and most recently, podcasts. Popular examples of true crime
works include the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer (2015), the non-fiction book
I’ll Be Gone In the Dark by Michelle McNamara (2018) and the film Zodiac (2007), and
countless more examples.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, true crime is sometimes described as trashy or distasteful,
indicating that the genre is morally repugnant and insensitive to the victims of crimes and their
families as the genre turns their tragedies into entertainment (Hughes 2016). Similarly,
according to Yardley et al. (2018: 6), existing research on the true crime genre suggests that
“what it tells us about crime is distorted, overemphasizing violent crimes like homicide […].
[It] draws distinct lines between ‘us’ and ‘them’ – the law abiding and the criminal other.”
Seltzer (2007: 16) further states that modern true crime turns crime fact into crime fiction, and
thus, true crime has become more entertainment than actual reality. In turn, true crime author
Bill James states in an interview that “certainly there is something distasteful about [true
crime]” (Hughes 2016); yet, he juxtaposes the distastefulness of discussing crime with the
abhorrence of the crime itself, i.e. is it not distasteful to put the victim in that circumstance in
the first place? And if we draw the line at distasteful, it would mean not investigating any crime
at all because that in itself would be tasteless. James goes on to say that “[w]hat I find most
offensive, honestly, is […] the assumption of moral superiority. […] people refuse to look at
what really happens because ‘well, you know, we are not the kind of people who take an interest
in that kind of thing’” (Ibid.). There are then at least two sides to opinions on true crime; one
that sees it as abhorrent and morally wrong to be interested in crime, and the other that sees
disdain towards crime as synonymous with being blind to the cruelties of the world. No matter
which opinion one favors, if any one of them, true crime narratives make for interesting
research material because of their nature.
1.2. The podcast
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED s.v. podcast 2019) defines ‘podcast’ as “[a] digital audio
file of speech, music, broadcast material, etc., made available on the Internet for downloading.”
It is widely accepted that Adam Curry and Dave Winer invented podcasting when they
recorded the first known podcast in 2004 (International Podcast Day 2016). The name podcast
was in turn invented by Guardian reporter Ben Hammersley by combining pod from ‘iPod’ –
the newest and most popular MP3 player at the time – with -cast from ‘to broadcast’
3

Ellen Seppälä
(International Podcast Day 2016; Hammersley 2004). First created as self-help guides or a new
way of providing information, the podcast has since evolved to include many more forms,
including stories, know-hows, discussions, comedy, education, and more. Furthermore, since
podcasts are not subject to the same temporal and spatial constraints as live broadcasts are, they
can attract a widespread and more diverse audience than radio might (McClung and Johnson
2010; Madsen and Potts 2010). Depending on the subscription details, most podcasts are free
to download or listen to on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or other channels. Podcasts are mostly
funded by advertisements, sponsors or listener donations. According to AdvertiseCast, the
industry average cost per 1,000 listeners for a 30 second ad is $18 (IAPAR 2020). Furthermore,
many podcasts lead listeners to their Patreon pages whereby making a small donation to the
podcast, one can get access to more material and bonus episodes. Today there are podcasts
available in multiple topics, from education, sports, and film to technology, religion, and
science, and in multiple languages around the world.
Despite being created in 2004, it is often stated that it was not until 2014 that podcasting
went from being a niche activity to a mainstream media platform (Yardley et al. 2018: 2). The
catalyst for this is often seen as the true crime podcast Serial. Presented by investigative
journalist Sarah Koenig, Serial reinvestigated the 1999 murder of 18-year-old high school
student Hae Min Lee and the subsequent conviction of her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, for the
crime (Ibid.). In Serial, Koenig set out to reinvestigate the case because Syed has always
protested his innocence. The podcast became instantaneously popular when it reached five
million downloads in record time (Ibid.), and even after a year after its release, in 2015, the
podcast was reportedly downloaded 500,000 times a day (Berry 2015: 170). Serial can also be
seen as a trailblazer for the true crime genre’s introduction into podcasting.
In February 2019, Podcast Insights stated that there are over 660,000 podcasts on
iTunes (Winn 2019) and in January 2020 this had risen to 850,000 (Winn 2020). These numbers
indicate that over a span of eleven months, if counted as 30 days per month, 575 new podcasts
were started each day. Moreover, if Podcast Insights’ calculations are to be believed, it would
indicate that there has been a 29% increase in new podcasts in about a year. These numbers
alone point to a massive increase in popularity of podcasts. In a survey by Edison Research, it
was reported that in the United States, as of 2019, 51% of the country’s population reported
having listened to a podcast. This is the first time since podcasting was introduced in 2004 that
over half the American population are aware of podcasting and listening to at least one.
Compared to 2018, there was an increase of an estimated 17 million people being aware of
podcasting in 2019, with an estimated 20 million more listening to a podcast in 2019. On
4

Ellen Seppälä
average, more men than women reported having listened to a podcast in the last month when
the survey was taken, with 36% versus 29%. Interestingly, 40% of listeners report being
between ages 12-24 and 39% of listeners between 25and 54. Only 17% report being over the
age of 55, signifying that podcasting is still a medium for the younger generation. The presented
statistics are from “The Infinite Dial 2019 Survey” by Edison Research.
1.3. True crime podcasts
As stated, one popular topic for podcasts is true crime. Of “Apple’s Top 25 Most Downloaded
Podcasts of 2018”, two or 8% were true crime podcasts. Similarly, of Apple’s Best Podcasts
of the Year of 2018, which looks at charting along with Apple’s editors’ best picks, four of 15
or 27% were true crime podcasts (“Apple” 2018). Despite searching, no clear number of how
many true crime podcasts there currently are could be found from a reliable source; however,
a file with thousands of English-language shows listed as true crime-themed was found online
(True Crime Podcast Database 2020). According to the Database, there exist over 2,800
English-language true crime podcasts around the world. Because the database’s reliability is
uncertain, and discounting that there might be shows that have since publication gone inactive
or there are duplicate shows, there is no way of knowing the credibility of this estimation.
However, one could still imagine that hundreds if not thousands more true crime podcasts in
various other languages exist today.
Like films and books have different approaches on how to tackle a topic, so do podcasts.
There are different kinds of true crime podcasts, with differences between the cases discussed,
the hosts and discussion methods, the length of the episodes, the structuring of episodes or a
series, and so on. The earlier mentioned podcast Serial’s first season is structured as a series of
twelve episodes all discussing and reinvestigating the murder of Hae Min Lee and conviction
of Adnan Syed. In contrast, there are podcasts that deal with a different case in every episode.
Some podcasts focus solely on serial killers and their crimes, while others deal with all kinds
of crimes, from arson to white collar crime. A number of podcasts relay the story from the
victim’s perspective, detailing their life before becoming a victim of a crime, and others focus
on the killer’s life and what led him or her to murder.
There are also differences between hosts; if there are one or several and how they
interact with each other and their listeners. A few podcasts only feature one person talking
about the case, while others have multiple people engaging in a discussion about a case and its
victim(s) and/or killer(s). Hosts either do not address the listeners at all or very little, or they
ask questions of the listeners and urge them to help solve the case in various ways.
5

Ellen Seppälä
Interestingly, there are podcasts that also feature other elements than discussion of
crime. For example, drinking is a popular element to add to the podcast. Podcasts like this
include Wine & Crime, True Crime Garage and Martinis & Murder. In for example the podcast
Martinis & Murder, they always have a special martini for every episode that the hosts drink
while discussing a case and that the listeners are encouraged to replicate and enjoy themselves.
In True Crime Garage, a new beer is introduced with every new episode.
Podcasts also differ in tone, which is to be expected with a topic such as true crime as
the topic can be tackled in multiple ways. There seems to be a recent rise of true crime podcasts
where humor is a main feature. The podcast Small Town Murder is a comedy true crime podcast
where in every new episode, the hosts introduce a small town in the United States, including
demographics and background of the town, and then discuss a murder that happened there.
They laugh at the small town and its resources, as well as often conservative nature. However,
they also ridicule the murderer, for example his or her efforts to not get caught. They have
branded themselves: “we’re assholes, not scumbags,” probably hinting that they are aware of
the questionable mixing of murder and comedy. However, these humor podcasts are immensely
popular on Apple Podcasts, perhaps because they bridge the massive gap between humor and
murder by making the crimes less frightening as one learns to laugh alongside them. Humor
hence becomes a safe and effective defense mechanism.
Furthermore, there are podcasts mainly aimed at women, who might be more afraid of
becoming a victim of a crime in today’s world than men. These podcasts try to help women
navigate the world in order to not get murdered by showing them how to arm themselves with
knowledge about what has happened to others in the past. The very popular My Favorite
Murder podcast features comedienne Karen Kilgariff and writer Georgia Hardstark discussing
crimes while bringing up issues affecting women, like how women are expected to be polite
even in dire circumstances. The hosts have coined multiple catchphrases for listeners to keep
in mind, including “Fuck Politeness.” The podcast has an avid fan base online with its
Facebook page having over 400,000 likes and followers and its Reddit group over 100,000
members (My Favorite Murder 2020; r/myfavoritemurder 2020).
Lastly, there are true crime podcasts that focus on different geographical areas; Nordic
True Crime features murders in Scandinavia and Finland and Hanzai focuses on crimes
committed in Japan. Then, like for all podcasts, there are true crime podcasts from different
cultures and in different languages, e.g. the Finnish Jäljillä, Swedish Mordpodden or Spanish
Policiales Argentinos. It is apparent that crime, being a global phenomenon, also has a global
fan base.

There are, of course, more ways to distinguish between true crime podcasts, but this
brief overview has presented a few major variations that is of value when navigating this field
of research. When discussing my material in a later section, I will detail why I chose the podcast
Crime Junkie for my research.
Perhaps building on what was discussed previously on the opinion of true crime, there
have been studies conducted on the allure of true crime podcasts, or true crime in general. A
study by Boling and Hull (2018: 104) found that among their 308 research participants, the
strongest motivators for listening to true crime podcasts were entertainment, convenience,
voyeurism and boredom. The same study found that women listened to true crime podcasts
more than men, 73% to 56%, which is a straight contradiction with statistics on podcast
listening in general (Infinite Dial 2019). In Boling and Hull (2018), women reported listening
to true crime podcasts as a way to escape or for social interaction, as they were more involved
in the online fan communities than men (Ibid). It has also been speculated that fear could play
a role in the popularity of true crime podcasts. As true crime podcasts often recount horrific
crimes, they have an “addictive quality because of the release of adrenaline in human bodies
when they feel fear – and binge-listening to true crime podcasts can cause this adrenaline rush
to repeat itself in quick bursts” (Stahl 2018). In a study by Bailey (2017: 94), she found that
participants who had listened regularly and frequently to a true crime podcast showed
significantly lowered levels of fear of crime than before they started listening, signifying that
listeners might feel less threatened after listening to a true crime podcast.

2. Background
2.1. Law Enforcement in the United States
The idea behind my choice of topic for this thesis comes from my interest in true crime podcasts
and the perception that people in the United States and outside of the country seem to have an
issue with American law enforcement and are vocal about it in many media channels. As my
research in this thesis will focus on how law enforcement is discussed and viewed in relation
to the cases reviewed by the podcast Crime Junkie, it is important to discuss the various
branches and agencies of law enforcement that exist in the United States in order to grasp the
terminology used in the podcast and in this research. The discussion in the present study will
not only involve the umbrella term law enforcement, but rather many more, specific terms, as
will become apparent in the section dealing with materials and methods used in this study. In
order for the reader to understand the material, analysis and subsequent discussion it is crucial
to understand the origin of the various terms. Therefore, an introduction of the forms of law
enforcement is presented below. Additionally, this section presents research that details public
opinion about the police, as it provides a picture of the current situation in the United States as
well as how the situation and opinions have developed over time.
2.1.1. Different branches of law enforcement
Firstly, the Bureau of Justice Statistics defines ‘law enforcement’ as follows: “the individuals
and agencies responsible for enforcing laws and maintaining public order and public safety.
Law enforcement includes the prevention, detection, and investigation of crime, and the
apprehension and detention of individuals suspected of law violation” (“Law Enforcement”
2019a)
One of the components of the United States criminal justice system is law enforcement,
which is an umbrella term for the policing agencies in the country. There are different branches
and agencies of law enforcement, and it is important to understand the distinction between
these. To begin with, law enforcement agencies are based on the United States fragmented
political structure of having federal, state and local levels of government (Horne 2004: 435).
Additionally, the local level is divided into county and municipality. With these in mind, the
main types of law enforcement are local law enforcement, i.e. municipal and county, state law
enforcement, and federal law enforcement. Apart from these, there are specialist police
departments with limited and varying jurisdictions who often serve special districts. These
8

Ellen Seppälä
include campus police, airport police, school district police, park police, and more, and they
often serve as security police in their respective districts.
Municipal law enforcement is operated by a local government in a municipality, for
example, a city, town or village (Diamond 2004: 296). The names and sizes of a municipal law
enforcement agency vary from municipality to municipality. Most agencies take the name
Municipality name followed by Police Department, e.g. New York City Police Department
(NYPD), while smaller municipalities, like towns or villages, might have one-officer
departments going by town marshal. Their jurisdiction is often limited by the local government
to the city, town, or village they are in, though some police departments have countywide
jurisdiction. The head of a police department is a chief of police, who is appointed by an entity
of the local government, such as a mayor (Ibid.). The police departments are made up of trained
officers entrusted with “maintenance of public peace and order, enforcement of laws, and
prevention and detection of crime” (Ibid.). In 2008, there were 12,501 local police departments
in the United States employing over 500,000 people (CSLLEA 2011: 4).
County law enforcement is most often made up of sheriff’s offices or departments or
county police. Some municipal police departments have countywide jurisdiction rather than
simply serving one municipality and are therefore also county police. As of 2008, there are
over 3,000 sheriff’s offices operating in the United States with over 300,000 full-time
employees (CSLLEA 2011: 5). Most sheriff’s offices serve small and sparsely populated
jurisdictions; about 50% of all offices serve populations under 25,000. Therefore, they, in
general, have less personnel as well (McKee 2004: 432). The median level for personnel in
sheriff’s offices was 18 full-time employees in 2008 (CSLLEA 2011: 6). Though sheriff’s
offices serve smaller jurisdictions, the geographical size can be larger than a city jurisdiction,
and therefore, the small personnel size might be an issue.
Sheriff’s offices are empowered by the state to serve counties and cities and a sheriff is
an elected official by the people of a county (McKee 2004: 423). Sheriffs are also not simply
police, as they can be in charge of all three aspects of the criminal justice system: law
enforcement, courts, and corrections, depending on state decisions on their services. That
means that the law enforcement duties of sheriff’s offices can include “response to criminal
incidents and calls for service, patrolling, crime investigation, traffic enforcement, direction
and control” (Ibid.). Most sheriff’s offices also have countywide jurisdiction in jail operation,
prisoner transportation, processing prisoners, enforcement of court orders, executing warrants,
and court security. More than 90% of all sheriff’s offices operate at least one jail (McKee 2004:
9

Ellen Seppälä
433). So, the sheriff’s office can have more duties in number and diversity than a local police
department, which can also limit their capabilities to handle certain cases.
State law enforcement includes state police agencies, also known as state highway
patrols or public safety departments depending on the state (O’Rourke 2004: 440). State police,
e.g. the Texas Rangers, provide law enforcement services throughout the state while county
law enforcement is constrained to one county and municipal law enforcement is constrained to
one municipality. State police also focuses on traffic offenses along state and inter-state
highways. Some state police also have investigative powers, often exercised through agencies,
like the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (Ibid). The degree of authority the state police has is
decided by every individual state, and, for example, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, and Ohio
state police only have authority in traffic activities, i.e. highway patrols, while New York,
Texas, Rhode Island, etc. have state police departments with statewide jurisdiction and
investigative authority (Ibid.). State law enforcement employs almost 10% of the United States’
law enforcement officers (Johnson and Olschansky 2010: 119). In 2008, there were 50 primary
state law enforcement agencies in the United States, one for each state except Hawaii (CSLLEA
2011: 2).
Nationwide, there was about one sworn officer for every 400 residents in 2008 for local,
county and state police (CSLLEA 2011: 3).
Lastly, federal law enforcement refers to the federal special jurisdiction agencies that
exist in the United States, because the country does not have a national, general-purpose police
force (Horne 2004: 435). A federal law enforcement agency is under the federal government
with the functions of preventing, detecting, and investigating crime and apprehending alleged
offenders (“Federal Law Enforcement” 2019). The agencies under federal law enforcement
include the well-known Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland
Security, and the Secret Service; however, the federal branch also includes the U.S.
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Postal Inspection Service, United States
Park Police, Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police, etc. Each agency has its own duties and
investigative authority under federal law, and all agencies have various forms of federal
jurisdiction in their area of expertise. This means, if a person is suspected of violating federal
law, they may be arrested by one of the federal agencies empowered to make arrests but also
by state or local authorities. When an arrest is made, federal suspects are most often transferred
to the custody of the U.S. Marshals for booking, processing, and detention (“Law enforcement”
2019b). In 2008, federal agencies employed about 120,000 full-time law enforcement officers
in the United States (FLEO 2012: 1).

2.1.2. Trust and confidence in American law enforcement
In order to understand what is meant with trust and confidence, a brief definition of the two
terms most often featured in surveys on police satisfaction is warranted. Both trust and
confidence are crucial parts of police legitimacy, meaning that the public views the police as a
legitimate actor in charge of public security (Liqun 2015). Without legitimacy, the police have
no authority, and without authority they have effectively failed. Similarly, questions about trust
or confidence involve evaluating the public’s willingness to engage, cooperate with and turn
to the police as a symbolic institution of power and authority (Ibid.: 245). Liqun further
distinguishes between the two terms as such: “trust in the police implies a certain level of risk
involved both at the individual level and at the institutional level, whereas confidence in the
police underscores the systemic nature of trust and it is more likely to be associated with an
evaluation of institutions rather than an evaluation of any individual incumbents” (Ibid.). The
term trust then becomes more personal than the term confidence in research on public
perception of the police. Participants are hence perhaps more likely to base opinions on
personal experiences with individual officers rather than the whole institution when asked
about trust, and vice versa.
Overall, data on the public’s perception of law enforcement and the criminal justice
system shows positive results, although there are differences between studies. In a survey
conducted in June 2018 with 1,520 random American citizens, confidence in the criminal
justice system proved to be low; only 22% reported having a “Great deal/Quite a lot” of
confidence in the system, while 41% stated they had “Some” confidence and 36% reported
having “Very little/None” (Saad 2018). In contrast, the majority of Americans have more trust
and confidence in the police than they have in other institutions according to Gallup’s survey
in 2017; 57% with “Great Deal/Quite a lot” of confidence (Norman 2017). This is up since the
record-low 52% in 2015 following the Black Lives Matter movement’s formation, when
American law enforcement was put under scrutiny because of their treatment of African
Americans. The last time the percentage was as low was in 1993, when the question of trust
and confidence in the police was first asked (Norman 2017). As a third comparison, a study
conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Office of Community Oriented
Policing Services (COPS) that surveyed over 13,000 people in 12 cities found that almost 80
percent of the public in each city was satisfied with the police in their neighborhood (O’Connor
Shelley et al. 2013: 528).
Though the overall results are mostly positive on public trust and confidence in law
enforcement, one might ask the important question if any individual factors influence the
11

Ellen Seppälä
public’s trust and confidence. Studies on what determines the public’s opinion of the police
have considered many dimensions and branches of law enforcement, including the role of
police, satisfaction with police services or procedures, assessments of police’s efforts in
preventing crime, and general feelings about the police (Cihan and Wells 2010: 348). As was
seen in the earlier section on branches of law enforcement, the complexity that surrounds
police, e.g. the variety of duties they have, their differing jurisdictions, and how they carry out
these duties, makes it difficult to concretely establish what the public bases their trust and
confidence in and therefore how opinions differ. In order to understand the public’s assessment,
studies have attempted to distinguish between factors that influence perceptions positively or
negatively, as well as factors that do not seem to influence public opinion at all or minimally
(Ibid.). This study adopts the same scope except that the focus is on the opinions of podcast
hosts rather than the public.
There are some individual factors that seem to have an impact on public perceptions of
the police. Most studies reveal that older persons have more confidence in the police than
younger persons (O’Connor 2008; Walker and Katz 2008; Brown and Benedict 2002; Worrall
1999). However, interestingly, a majority of studies indicate that there is no significant
difference between genders and public perception of police (Walker and Katz 2008; Brown
and Benedict 2002; Worrall 1999). In general, this study deals with fairly young podcast hosts.
Studies have also found that though racial and ethnic minorities in the United States
tend to have positive perceptions of police, their ratings are lower than that of Whites (Walker
and Katz 2008; Brown and Benedict 2002). African Americans tend to view the police more
negatively than other minorities, but some studies present the idea that this has little to do with
racial background and more to do with previous contact with the police and the condition of
their neighborhood, e.g. high rates of crime and social disorder versus low (Walker and Katz
2008). In regard to this, Sherman (2002: 2) refers to inequality in the United States based on
area. Neighborhood conditions affect opinion and areas with higher levels of crime also have
lower levels of trust and confidence in the police. According to Sherman, in 2002, more than
50 percent of homicides occurred in areas where less than 5 percent of the population lived. In
such areas, it was reported that as few as one in four adults had a job, while the arrest and
incarceration rates exceeded the national average, which might explain how such an area’s
residents experience crime and social justice in a much different way than their suburban
counterparts.
Some research suggests that people with higher education levels are more satisfied with
the police, while other studies find no correlation between education and satisfaction (Walker
12

Ellen Seppälä
and Katz 2008; Brown and Benedict 2002). However, a study by Eschholz et al. (2002) found
that White males without a college degree were more positive of the police after having
watched police television programs. This will be discussed further in the next chapter on the
media’s influence on people’s perception of law enforcement.
There exists an idea that having had contact with the police in the past has a great impact
on a person’s trust in police (Brown and Benedict 2002). Persons who had had contact with the
police tended to be less satisfied than those without contact. Other factors that contributed to
this were whether the contact had been voluntary or involuntary or in which capacity the
contact was, assistance or crime related (Brown and Benedict 2002). Perhaps not surprisingly,
those who initiated the contact with police themselves were more satisfied than those who had
involuntary contact (O’Connor Shelley 2012: 530).
People who feel safe in their neighborhoods and feel that the police are controlling
crime are more satisfied with police (Walker and Katz 2008), which is to be expected since the
police are in charge of preventing crime. Here one could also mention Sherman’s statement
(2002), which was mentioned above, that neighborhood conditions and the racial divide
between neighborhoods in the United States have an influence on people’s opinions of police.
People in neighborhoods with higher crime rates tend to have lower opinions of police despite
what the general consensus is (Sherman 2002). Since the United States is predominantly White,
survey data can be biased towards Whites, showing results about neighborhood safety as higher
overall but disregarding potential racial and socio-economic differences.
Prior victimization and fear of crime tend to correlate with lower satisfaction with
police (Sampson and Bartusch 1998). This is interesting because it might signify that people
who have been victims of a crime feel that police are not doing their job, i.e. catching the
perpetrators. If victims had confidence in the police, it would perhaps signify the opposite.
As detailed, although public opinion of the police has generally been positive, there are
a number of demographical and contextual variables that influence these views. However,
Bradford and Jackson (2009: 192) observe, and caution, that the way different surveys ask
different kinds of questions around trust and confidence has a major impact on the results.
Some refer to basic concepts and measures while others see opinions as multi-faceted with
concerns and judgements about various topics. There is a difference in asking “how much
confidence do you have in the police” on a four-point scale from a great deal to very little, or
agreement or disagreement with statements such as “the police are doing a good job in dealing
with problems that really concern people in this neighborhood.” The difference in how each
study presents its questions is of importance when thinking about the results. It is apparent that
13

Ellen Seppälä
questions with more detail elicit specific answers to specific cases, while with broad questions
the researcher has no way of knowing what the subject was thinking of when answering; ‘the
police’ can refer to many different entities and persons for a subject. Then there is the idea that
subjects’ opinions of the police can be comprised of different elements or concerns which are
distinct from one another, although still related, and that these elements may be in conflict with
each other (Bradford & Jackson 2009: 194). For example, there can be different degrees of
fairness; a subject may think that there is unfairness in criminal procedures but not in the
distribution of offences. Therefore, a simple question such as “Do you think the justice system
is fair?” carries little meaning without specification.
To conclude, Sherman (2002) states that “on issues of trust and confidence in the
criminal justice system [law enforcement included], there is evidence of at least two nations:
one that is comfortable with the status quo and one that is not.” As with the Black Lives Matter
movement and the so-called Ferguson effect, which will be discussed in the next chapter,
inequality in the United States between ethnic, racial and socio-economic groups is apparent.
Such differences sharply influence public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system
and law enforcement. Furthermore, there has been a rise in recent years of the topic of police
brutality and use of excessive force in the United States. Using The Guardian’s The Counted
database, which counts how many people in the United States have been killed by police, it
was calculated that whereas there have been 55 fatal police shootings in the last 24 years in
England and Wales, there were 59 fatal police shootings within 24 days in January 2015 in the
United States only (Lartey 2015). That equaled 2.5 people killed by police per day. It was also
shown that there were 188% more people killed in the state of California alone in 2015 than on
average in the whole of Canada yearly: 72 shootings as opposed to 25 shootings. And
California is only 10% more populous than Canada (Ibid).
With figures and databases like the ones discussed above, the media can also influence
how people subjectively and collectively view the police. As podcasts can influence in much
the same way as media, in the next chapter, I will discuss how the media can be seen to
influence public perception of crime and law enforcement.

2.2. The Influence of Media
This section reviews research about the media’s influence on the public, specifically, research
on the public’s perception of crime, and their trust and confidence in law enforcement or the
justice system. Furthermore, research on podcasts’ influence on their listeners is also presented
in this section. The section will also act as a justification for this thesis, because the research
might allude to how true crime podcasts could potentially influence its audience’s opinions.
Podcasts featuring discussion of criminal investigations and law enforcement might have an
influence on their fan club members’ trust and confidence in the police as a consequence of
listening to said podcasts.
However, while this section is going to present research that states that the media
influence the public, as is the common belief in the research community, it will not state that
media is the only and sole influencer of people’s opinions. Criticism of the idea that media
influence public opinion states that media do nothing but reflect on and reproduce general
public opinion that is already apparent from values and convictions (Boda & Szabó 2011: 338).
This argument implies that media do not influence people, but vice versa. Similarly, Rafter
(2000: 7) states that crime films draw from reality and in turn shape social thought about crime.
Therefore, one should see media not as a direct influencer, but as an agent that shapes society
in conjunction with what it portrays.
However, if the media only mirror the public, it would mean that they have no agenda
of their own. This is against both the findings of media research and broader public opinion on
the media’s role in society. Boda & Szabó (2011: 338) found that though their research
participants firmly believed that media influence the public, they perceived themselves to be
exempt from the influence. This is interesting, as people might want to believe that they are
immune to the media’s influence, when actually they are inadvertently affected by it.
2.2.1. Media’s influence on public perception of crime in the US
Before discussing research on public perception of crime, it is relevant to present some recent
statistics on the crime rates in the United Stated. Examining crime rates as a whole in the United
States and how the rates have increased or decreased over decades provides an insight into if
the public’s perception of crime today is reasonable. According to Brennan Center for Justice’s
“Crime Trends” overview from 1991-2016, the national crime rate decreased for the fourteenth
year in a row in 2015 and though there was a slight increase again in 2016, the crime rate is
still less than half of what it was in 1991 (Friedman et al. 2017). This fact that crime is at a
historical low in the United States is corroborated by many researchers (Gramlich 2019; James
15

Ellen Seppälä
2018; CIUS 2017). Though there was a slight increase in violent crimes and murder in 2016
from the years before, it can be explained by local factors (Friedman et al. 2017). Major cities
like Chicago stood for 43.7% of the increase in murder in the nation in 2016. Crime rates then
vary majorly between cities in the US, with urban metropolitan areas having higher rates than
rural areas. This indicates that urban cities have their own local problems and that the increase
is because of this urban violence and not evidence of a national crime wave (Friedman et al.
2017).
Gramlich (2019) goes on to state that public perception of crime in the United States
does not match the data on crimes. Americans generally believe that there is a national increase
in crime. According to Gallup’s poll data from 1989 to 2018, apart from two years the majority
of the people surveyed answered that there was “More” crime in the United States that year
than the year before. Responses ranged between 89% to 53% of people surveyed (Gallup 2019).
One might then ask where this fear of crime that the public is apparently feeling comes from?
Which factors contribute to the feeling that crime has been increasing when data says
otherwise?
The argument that crime is heavily covered by the media and that this coverage has
effects on public perception about crime is widely accepted by the scientific community (Potter
and Kappeler 2006; Mason 2003). Research linking television media and attitudes about crime
began with Gerbner’s cultivation studies. He hypothesized that watching television distorted
the viewer’s perception of social problems, often creating a feeling of the world as a dangerous
place (Gerbner & Gross 1976). The content itself did not matter as such, but the exposure to
television in general was believed to influence the viewer. Similarly, recent research shows
that media create a picture of a society where crime is frequent and steadily increasing, despite
what data shows. Also, it is further believed that media misrepresent the nature of crime, i.e.
violent crimes are presented more often in media than other crimes, thus showing the public
on a daily basis stories of murder and rape despite the fact that violent crimes are rarer than
other forms of crime, e.g. property crime (Friedman et al. 2017). However, it is unclear just
how much the media affect peoples’ opinions and if and in what respect the effect has
consequences for criminal justice.
Research shows that the media’s reporting of crime has an influence on the public’s
panic, the so-called moral panic tradition (Cohen 1972). The suggestion is that exposure to
crime stories in the media is related to heightened fear of crime. Fox (2012: 162) observes that
the English-language newspaper media’s increase in usage of the term “sex offender” from
1989 to 2009 had an effect on the public’s moral panic on the subject. This despite the fact that
16

Ellen Seppälä
sexual offending against children declined by 53% from 1990-2007 (Ibid: 166). Though the
crime rates did not increase, coverage on the matter did, leading to increases in fear and outrage
as the public were led to believe, by the media, that there was a larger risk of becoming a victim
of sexual predators (Ibid: 172). Fox (2012) ascertains that the media’s intensive coverage,
dubbed “tabloid crime stories,” served to tell the public how to think about the issue. This led
to a panic that distorted their understanding of the problem but not their willingness for justice
(Critcher 2003: 117).
It had been assumed that one of the strongest media effects is on behavior, dubbed the
crimogenic media tradition (Surette 2007). It argues that because media’s focus is on reporting
crime and deviant behavior, it will lead the audience down a path of deviance. This assumption
can still be seen today in rallies against violence in for example video games. Parents are led
to believe that their children playing violent games will lead to the child expressing violent
behavior. However, no correlation of this kind has been found (see for example Ferguson
2011). Furthermore, on the topic of modern media, Doyle (2006: 868) states that anxieties
about crime have passed into popular culture, e.g. films and television featuring crime and
violence. This has further fueled the debate on violent media leading to violent behavior.
Specifically conservative and right-wing politicians tend to blame media for social ills and
moral decay.
Despite there being a difference between crime news and crime fiction, both forms of
media offer the same qualities of drama and thus have the same opportunity to influence the
public (Ericson et al. 1991). There have been cases where entertainment media can be seen to
have influenced its audience and transferred into the justice systems. The so-called CSI effect,
whereby jurors have been perceived to be influenced by the popular 2000-2015 television
series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and tainted by the show’s wrongful depictions of
forensic science. The abundance of forensic evidence and dismissal of circumstantial evidence
in the show is believed to have given a wrongful picture of a legal case. The implications of
this “effect” lie in the fact that jurors wrongly believe that cases in the legal system are built
on forensic evidence alone and swift and easy justice happens (Cole & Dioso-Villa 2007: 442).
Also, it has been noted that the news media furthered the worry about the CSI effect by
increasing the alarm and anxiety about what this effect meant for the criminal justice system
(Cole & Dioso-Villa 2007: 445-6). The drama that is crime television hence transitioned into
crime news (for more research on the CSI effect, see Watkins (2004) and Hayes and Levett
(2012)). The idea of entertainment media having a negative effect on the criminal justice
system will be further discussed in the section on true crime podcasts’ influence.
17

Ellen Seppälä
At this time, it might be interesting to introduce Stucky’s (2005: 140) study that shows
that a perceived increase in crime often leads to citizen demand for action, which often results
in an increased presence of police. Therefore, crime and police go hand in hand. However,
public demand is often unequal because power amongst groups is unequal. It is assumed that
crime control will focus on the interest of the economically powerful because they have more
political influence over the state, and most police budgets are politically determined (Ibid.).
Thus, economy and politics enter the same realm as crime and police, which might allude to a
problem. Boda and Szabó (2011: 337) also state that the belief that there is a steady rise in
crime despite data stating the opposite, might indicate that the public’s trust and confidence in
the police is low, as will be discussed in the next section.
2.2.2. Media’s influence on public perception of law enforcement
As was already discussed in the previous chapter on the public’s trust and confidence in law
enforcement, general opinions towards the police are favorable and have not been declining in
recent years. However, there were some demographical differences between opinions.
When researching why crime rates fluctuate nationally and locally, there are many
hypotheses brought forward; however recently, the discussion of a “Ferguson effect” has been
gaining interest (James 2018: 15). The Ferguson effect refers to an idea that after the shooting
of 18-year-old, African American Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by a police officer,
the increased scrutiny that police faced led to so-called “de-policing.” This means that police
officers became aware of the scrutiny their profession faced and grew unwilling to do work
because of fear of being publicly accused of racial discrimination or use of excessive force
(Wolfe & Nix 2016: 1). According to some scholars (Wolfe & Nix 2016; Pyrooz et al. 2016)
de-policing serves as an explanation to the increases in violent crime in some cities.
Furthermore, the Ferguson effect and subsequent police shootings of African Americans may
have led the public to view justice as something which is not fairly administered between social
groups in the United States (James 2018: 15). According to James (2018: 15) this might
consecutively “empower some individuals to engage in behaviors that directly challenge the
legitimacy of law enforcement and others not to turn to law enforcement for help when crime
occurs.” This idea is corroborated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ survey on crime
victimization, where in 2017 only 45% of all violent crimes and 36% of all property crimes
were reported to police (NCVS 2018). There might be different reasons for this, although there
might be a correlation with distrust as well.
18

Ellen Seppälä
Furthermore, according to Sherman (2002: 28), recent research has found that changes
in culture, like the interest in showcasing racial and ethnic discrimination, has shifted the focus
of trust from results to procedures. This effectively means that police conduct has become more
important than a decrease in crime, which is often seen as the main result of policing. Eschholz
et al. (2002: 336) found a racial difference between their research participants and police
programs’ influence on levels of confidence in law enforcement. The group influenced
positively by such programs was White males without a college education, as they showed
increased levels of confidence. In contrast, African American males’ confidence levels were
not affected by the programs, which Eschholz et al. (2002) attribute to the fact that the police
depicted in the shows were predominantly White while the criminals were African American.
As was introduced before, with modern media such as television – and nowadays
podcasts as well – the public may be influenced by how law enforcement and the criminal
justice system are portrayed in entertainment as well as news media. They might base their
trust in portrayals rather than realities (Sherman 2002: 28), as can be seen from the discussion
of the CSI effect. Rafter (2000: 3) states that crime films’ portraying corrupt police and police
brutality often end with triumph, offering the viewer solace and justice. This she means shows
us both what we fear to be true – police corruption – and the fantasy of how we want it to be.
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that by seeing these triumphs in the media, the public
might, as James (2018: 15) states, be empowered to challenge the legitimacy of law
enforcement.
Similarly, in Kort-Butler & Sittner Hartshorn’s study (2011:48) their subjects who
reported viewing non-fictional crime programs were more likely to be less supportive of the
justice system. This was thought to indicate that viewing non-fiction crime programs served as
infotainment, i.e. information and entertainment. Such shows provide information about
criminal events but can make it seem like crime in the United States is out of control, as was
discussed in the earlier section. Moreover, these shows present the challenges the criminal
justice system faces in dealing with crime swiftly and fairly, further amplifying the public’s
fear by dramatic effect (Ibid.).
However, there is another side to the coin. Gerbner and Gross (1976) found, in
accordance with their cultivation hypothesis, that people who watched “reality” police
programs had a higher confidence in law enforcement. This was corroborated in Eschholz et
al.’s study (2002). “Reality” police programs, Eschholz et al. (2002: 331) explain, refer to
programs that present actual footage of police activities, but footage that is limited to brief
action-filled moments that give the viewer a distorted picture of policing, hence “reality.” A
19

Ellen Seppälä
reason for such programs resulting in higher confidence in law enforcement might be that the
police is seen as the de facto “good guy” whereas the criminals are the “bad guys.”
There is no uniform opinion if and how much the media affect public perception and
trust and confidence in law enforcement. Competing studies reveal either that media have
positive or negative influence on the public. However, in recent years there seems to be an
increase in seeing police procedures and conduct as an important factor in establishing trust
and confidence. More recent studies have found that their participants view police’s treatment
of people as at least equally important as providing results (James 2018; Boda & Szabó 2011;
Sherman 2002). In most respects, one could conclude that though the media have been found
to influence people’s opinions on law enforcement, a consensus on whether it is mostly positive
or negative influence cannot be reached. There are multiple historical and individual factors
that manipulate the results, i.e. personal experiences, gender, education level, race and
ethnicity, to name a few. However, the aim of this section was to demonstrate that the various
forms of media do affect the public’s perception of law enforcement. The next section will
focus solely on podcasts as a medium and if and how they can be seen to contribute to the
influence.
2.2.3. True crime podcasts’ influence on their audience
When discussing true crime podcasts, one has to consider the impact such podcasts can have
on their audiences. Interestingly, and as has been seen with media influence on the public when
it comes to crime, the impact of true crime podcasts can already be seen in the courthouse.
Inmates claiming innocence are using the media to tell their story (D’Addario 2016), as can be
seen from Netflix’s Making a Murderer documentary. The documentary led to 180,000 people
signing a petition to have the convicted man Steven Avery acquitted (Ibid.). Similarly, cases
like Adnan Syed’s attracted a national following after the podcast Serial, which some believe
helped in granting Syed a new trial in 2016 (Syed v. Maryland). Simpson (2017) also points
out that true crime narratives of cases, famous or not, might bring failings in the justice system
to people’s attention. Rabia Chaudry, Adnan Syed’s public advocate states in Simpson (2017):
“True crime has always captured the imagination. What’s different now is the awareness of
how often the system gets it wrong, so the popularity [in true crime] is really around wrongful
convictions” (Simpson 2017). And often one assumes that at the base of a wrongful conviction
is an investigation that has gone wrong or an injustice towards a person, and hence, the true
crime podcasts that take a new look at criminal cases also let people hear about the failings by
the police.
20

Ellen Seppälä
Furthermore, there is an idea that true crime podcasts can bring back unsolved cases to
the public’s attention (Simpson 2017). Because of the sheer size of the United States, many
cases receive only local news reporting and never reach the wider public, and therefore, there
might be important facts that police are never made aware of because people who know
something about a case, do not know that there is a case to begin with. With podcasts you can
listen almost wherever you are as they are not demographically restricted like radio, meaning
that more people can hear about cases and actually be able to help in providing useful
information. Then, as has been speculated about the podcast The Teacher’s Pet, there is a
possibility that podcasts acquire information or clues that the police have missed that lead to
new developments (Dury 2016). This might go hand in hand with people being more
comfortable coming forward to investigative journalists than the police, according to BBC
journalist Fiona Walker, who received tips about a cold case from a person who was afraid of
coming forward to the police (Dury 2016). However, this is just speculation, and the social and
political consequences of true crime podcasts’ influence remain to be seen, as it is a very new
medium which is still scarcely researched.
Available research has found the true crime genre to reinforce the status quo, i.e. social
and cultural anxieties are explored only to be appeased in the end when the criminal is caught
and punished, justice is served and order in society is maintained (Durham et al. 1995; Jermyn
2007). However, Yardley et al. (2018: 9) state that true crime podcast differs from other media
depicting the genre. Instead of providing the audience with resolution in the end, there are a lot
of questions and a lot of “’uns’ – uncertain, unsolved, unresolved, unfinished, untrusted”
(Yardley et al. 2018: 11). They suggest that stories told by other media and the court were often
found to be inconclusive and unfinished when reviewed in true crime podcasts. Furthermore,
and of importance for my study, Yardley et al. (2018: 10) posit that podcasts’ portrayals of
investigations and the criminal justice system are often concerned with trust and characterized
by doubt with key questions being “Can we trust the police?”. Hence, the audience of a true
crime podcasts are, according to Yardley et al., more likely to be exposed to questions about
the validity of convictions and the so-called ‘uns’ of criminal cases and the criminal justice
system. Therefore, one might assume that the audience grows more critical in conjunction with
the podcast hosts’ retelling of a story or case.
Yardley et al. (2018: 11) also posit that podcast audiences grow tired with the crime
narratives of mainstream media and instead engage in online communities as so-called citizen
detectives, investigating and discussing crimes themselves. This is corroborated in another
study, one that states a characteristic of the true crime podcast audience is that they are
21

Ellen Seppälä
engaging. According to Boling and Hull (2018: 105) the true crime podcast audience is an
active consumer, with 63% of their participants reporting being active in an online podcastspecific community. This signifies that a true crime podcast listener is participatory in nature
and goes hand in hand with the finding that a strong motivation for listening to true crime is
entertainment. Their participants reported discussing true crime with others either Often (17%)
or Sometimes (49%) (Boling & Hull 2018: 102).
On another spectrum, research has found that listeners of the popular My Favorite
Murder (MFM) podcast have found a way to critique violent and oppressive patriarchal culture
(Stjerneby 2018; Sacks 2017). There is further research that argues that women take interest in
true crime because it provides ideas and tactics on how to deal with dangerous situations
(Vicary & Fraley 2010). In these studies, it was found that online community fan clubs for
MFM functioned as a support group for women. As the hosts discussed patriarchal culture,
amongst other things, the audience was strengthened by feelings of solidarity with the hosts
and other listeners. Thus, podcasts have the power to lift people up, not just bring them down.
One might assume that with a topic such as crime one might have a difficult time trying to turn
the conversation positive, but MFM and other comedy true crime podcasts certainly succeed in
turning anxieties of even the bleakest of crimes around.
In an article in the New Yorker, Mead (2018) states that the real innovation in Serial
was host Sarah Koenig’s psychological process, namely her inner struggle to decide whether
Syed was guilty or not. This made the podcast interesting to the audience, as it deals with the
question of right and wrong. Listeners tuned in to the end to find out what Koenig decided,
maybe to see if it mirrored their own decisions. Most true crime podcasts deal with just that,
the question of guilty or not guilty. However, the question is neither easily asked nor easily
answered. While most true crime podcasts claim to relay the important facts about a criminal
case, there is no way of knowing where the information comes from. Crime Junkie host Ashley
Flowers often cites news articles or true crime documentaries about cases. She sometimes
points out that the articles she has read give many different pictures of the same incidents. It is
therefore important that listeners realize that true crime is not inherently crime fact. A critique
of the influence true crime podcasts has on their audience is that it might lead to even more
wrongful convictions and worse, releasing murderers back on the streets. Deutsch (2006) states
that “[c]rime-show junkies […] could end up deciding guilt or innocence in real trials” as
jurors. As can be seen from the discussion of the CSI effect, crime fiction is not the same as
crime fact and not realizing the difference between entertainment and reality can have dire
consequences on the justice system. This was also said in relation to true crime, as Seltzer
22

Ellen Seppälä
(2007: 16) explained that true crime is entertainment more than reality, which is something the
audience needs to be aware of.

3. Theoretical Framework
According to van Dijk (2008: 2), there is no fixed method for doing discourse studies. Factors
that influence the choice of method can for instance be: “the aim of the investigation, the nature
of the data studied, the interests and the qualifications of the researcher and other parameters
of the research context” (Van Dijk 2008: 2). Hence, choosing a methodology for my study
proved challenging.
As I am interested in analyzing how the podcast hosts discuss law enforcement on a
level that encompasses their opinions and values of law enforcement as well as general
discussion of their practices and actions, the importance of choosing a theoretical framework
that allows for both is crucial. However, as my material includes a lot of discussion where law
enforcement is not present, I also need to be able to identify the important instances within my
material that should be analyzed.
For my research, I chose two different approaches, whose combination appeared to be
the best way to analyze my material. Firstly, I used corpus linguistics to identify the instances
in the material where law enforcement was discussed, as well as to get general quantitative
data about my material for reference. Then, for my analysis of the discussion of law
enforcement, I chose appraisal theory analysis as it provided the means to qualitatively analyze
the material in a way that evaluates the podcast hosts’ discussion including opinions and values.
I will present the theoretical background of both approaches in this section, before going further
into the gathering of my material and methods with which these approaches were used to
analyze the material of each in the next chapter.
3.1. Corpus Linguistics
According to Hunston (2006), corpus linguistics (henceforth CL) can be used to add a
quantitative dimension to studies of linguistics. Furthermore, one reason for choosing CL as
one of the methodologies for my study was the fact that the method allowed for finding
linguistic features, like vocabulary, in podcast transcripts easily and unbiasedly. Using a
corpus-based approach allowed for computerized analysis of my material, which eliminated
23

Ellen Seppälä
the possibility of human error in the gathering of quantitative data of my material. Thus I chose
to use a corpus-based approach for the quantitative part of my analysis of the podcast episodes,
i.e. to both find terms used for law enforcement as well as identify the frequency with which
they occur in the material. It should be noted that corpus linguistics encompasses both
quantitative and qualitative approaches to discourse analysis, and therefore despite referring to
the corpus-based approach as mainly quantitative, it did require a certain amount of qualitative
analysis in order to know which lexical items to search in the corpus.
With CL, a researcher is able to find and analyze word frequencies, word clusters,
collocates, and keywords. Such features can show how words are used and what their relative
importance is for the meaning of the text. However, frequency of a particular word does not
immediately signify that the word is of importance for the text’s meaning. For example,
function words such as the, and, and or will most often be high in frequency in both spoken
and written communication despite not carrying much importance themselves. Thus, a
quantitative analysis on its own would not be able to distinguish between words of
commonality and words of importance, meaning that another method was required to analyze
the vocabulary that was found in my material, as will be detailed in the next section.
3.2. Appraisal Model
Appraisal theory is a psychological research theory that concerns itself with how evaluations
– i.e. appraisals – of events and situations elicit emotions out of us humans. Appraisal theorists
tend to see thought and emotion as largely inseparable, meaning that emotions arise from our
perceptions, i.e. our appraisals, of changes in our environment. It can be said that our appraisals
of an event are influenced by our temperament, culture, physiology, current goals, and our past
experiences. Appraisal theory also accounts for individual variability in our reactions, i.e. that
similar events can raise different emotions in different people, or in the same person at different
times (Smith & Lazarus 1990; Ellsworth 2013).
Appraisal in discourse analysis is a separate but related field of study to the
psychological research theory, although their inherent principles are similar. Essentially,
appraisal concerns our experiences influencing our evaluation or approval / disapproval of
things and ideas presented to us. In linguistics, appraisal is similar to stance-taking as both are
to an extent concerned with evaluation (Du Bois 2007: 142). Appraisal theory in discourse
analysis has been studied most notably by J. R. Martin and P. R. R. White in their book The
Language of Evaluation (2005). Together, Martin and White have created a model or system
by which to analyze evaluation in text or how a writer or speaker expresses their opinion or
24

Ellen Seppälä
stance in relation to certain ideas or things. For the researchers, meaning is seen as construed
in context and dependent on a social relationship between the speaker and idea / thing rather
than being an individual, psychological, or self-made form of language (Martin & White: 2005:
94.) Language of evaluation is described by Martin and White as being concerned with
The interpersonal in language, with the subjective presence of
writers/speakers in texts as they adopt stances towards both the material
they present and those with whom they communicate. It is concerned
with how writers/speakers approve and disapprove, enthuse and abhor,
applaud and criticise [sic], and with how they position their
readers/listeners to do likewise.
(2005: 1)
Appraisal is grounded in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and is presented as a set of
alternatives that are available to every writer. Between these alternatives of expression, the
writer makes a choice that shapes his or her text in evaluative terms. The development of this
new model was initiated by Martin and White with the discovery that other analytical tools
provided by SFL would not suffice when researching the semantic resources that speakers use
for evaluation (Hommerberg 2011: 60).
It needs to be mentioned that White (2001; 2002: 4) states that appraisal should be seen
as an on-going research project and that the framework can be seen as a draft or grossly
generalized set of categories which can still be narrowed down further. It should also be noted
that the appraisal model does not contain strict guidelines and wordlists that instantly show
whether a sentence belongs to a system of appraisal. Rather, the model is meant to help the
researcher by explaining the process behind evaluation, how certain words can be seen as
belonging to a certain system rather than another. The interpretation of a text or texts in regard
to the appraisal model is entirely dependent on the researcher and on the text sample’s
composition.
The appraisal model includes three main systems: attitude, engagement and
graduation. Each of these main systems is then divided into subsystems that include different
subcomponents (please see Figure 1 below). I will not be referring to all of the systems in my
analysis of the podcast episodes, but a short description of the whole appraisal model is in order
to demonstrate the possibilities it presents for language study. In order to keep this section as
clear as possible, each system and its various subcomponents will be presented briefly,
explaining their relevance as part of the appraisal model. Subsequently, in the materials and

25

Ellen Seppälä
methods section of this study, a more detailed discussion will be presented for the systems
crucial to the present study.

3.2.1. Attitude
Within the appraisal model, the system of attitude refers to the expression of personal feelings
in relation to a given situation and covers three semantic regions of emotion, ethics and
aesthetics (Martin & White 2005: 42). Attitude is further divided into three subcomponents:
affect (emotional reactions), appreciation (of objects), and judgement (of people) (see Figure
2 below for clarification of the subsystem). Affect refers to evaluation by the appraiser
experiencing a reaction or emotion, either positive or negative, directed toward or elicited by
the idea or thing that is appraised by the speaker. Words of affect include love and hate and
can be directed towards any kind of entity. Appreciation and judgement, however, are directed
towards different kinds of entities. Appreciation is appraisal of “products, performances and
naturally occurring phenomena” (Martin 2000: 159) or aesthetic assessments, while judgement
deals with appraisal of human behavior or ethical assessments. There is also the distinction
between the two as appraisal of the non-human versus appraisal of the human.
Each of these subsystems include their own subcomponents, encompassing both
positive and negative words of evaluation in all levels. Affect may be realis or irrealis or an
evaluation belonging to either inclination, happiness, security and satisfaction. Appreciation
includes subcomponents of reaction, composition, and valuation. Judgement involves either
social esteem or social sanction, which will be explained in more detail in another section.

Figure 2: The attitude subsystem
(Adapted from Read & Carroll 2012: 425.)

When thinking of emotions and feelings, what most often comes to mind might be happiness
or unhappiness of a situation; the mood of happy or sad. Affect also includes feelings of
(in)security, (dis)satisfaction and (dis)inclination. These encompass words of opposites like
anxious vs. assured, displeasure vs. pleasure and yearn for vs. wary.
Appreciation is concerned with our evaluation of things and phenomena: our reactions
to them, their composition and their value to us. Words that signify appreciation include
exciting vs. boring (reaction; impact), beautiful vs. ugly (reaction; quality), logical vs.
contradictory (composition: balance), intricate vs. plain (composition: complexity), deep vs.
shallow (valuation). These can be elucidated by questions such as “did it grab me?” (reaction),
“did it hang together?” (composition) and “was it worthwhile?” (valuation). According to
Martin and White (2005: 57), appreciation can be seen as the way we look at things; reaction
is affection, composition is perception and valuation is cognition. There is also a difference
between affect and appreciation even though they might seem similar to some extent. Affect is
the emotion that a person feels, “I am sad”, while appreciation is the explanation of an
emotional thing, “it was a sad film.”
Judgement refers to our attitudes and emotions towards people and how they behave
(Martin & White 2005: 52). The subcomponent is further divided into judgements of esteem
27

Ellen Seppälä
and judgements of sanction. Judgements of esteem deal with people’s normality, capacity and
tenacity, while judgements of sanction are oriented towards people’s veracity and propriety.
When it comes to positive and negative evaluation within social esteem, one can distinguish
them by saying that positive evaluation of people is related to admiring, while negative
evaluation of people is criticizing. Similarly, within social sanction, positive evaluation refers
to praising someone, while negative evaluation refers to condemning someone. Examples of
judgements of esteem and sanction include normal vs. odd (normality), healthy vs. sick
(capacity), brave vs. cowardly (tenacity), honest vs. deceitful (veracity) and caring vs. cruel
(propriety). Questions that might elucidate judgement include, in order of normality, capacity,
tenacity, veracity and propriety: “how special / capable / dependable / honest or how far beyond
reproach someone is?”
3.2.2. Engagement and Graduation
In short, engagement refers to how a writer or speaker construes their point of view and adopts
stances towards others’ perspectives. Engagement is therefore concerned with opinions, i.e.
that text or speech conveys opinions or responds to other’s opinions. Engagement is divided
into monoglossic or heteroglossic utterances. Monoglossic refers to the speaker not allowing
for other opinions than their own and includes no sublevels as such. Heteroglossic, on the other
hand, is the opposite and includes two sublevels that explain the ways in which a writer or
speaker acknowledges their viewpoint and other’s. Heteroglossic utterances can either contract
or expand dialogue. See Figure 3 below for clarification of the engagement heteroglossic
subsystem.

28

Ellen Seppälä
As can be seen in Figure 3 above, the subsystem includes several subcomponents under both
the contract and expand systems. As these are not relevant to the present study and will not be
used as a method of analysis, I have decided to not describe them further. For detailed
information on the engagement subsystem, please see Martin & White (2005) or Read and
Carroll (2012).
In the appraisal model, graduation refers to how writers and speakers alter the strength
of their utterances and it can be seen as an addition to both attitude and engagement. Namely,
graduation in attitude allows the speaker to appear more or less negative or positive depending
on the words chosen in relation to expressions of emotion. Similarly, with engagement,
graduation escalates a speaker’s conviction in their propositions (Read & Carroll 2012: 428).
Furthermore, the appraisal model suggests two ways of graduating attitude, or “two
axes of scalability”: focus and force (Martin & White 2005: 137). (See Figure 4 below for
clarification of the graduation subsystem.)

(Adapted from Read & Carroll 2012: 428.)

Focus aims to redefine categories that are otherwise bound, or so-called either-or categories.
This refers to something either being or not being, and depends on predetermined conditions.
For example, the two sentences “They don’t play real jazz” and “They play jazz, sort of” show
that while jazz music would be an either-or category – music is either jazz music or it is some
other kind of music – the sentences have been redefined so that there is scalability of what jazz

29

Ellen Seppälä
music is. It has become a matter of degree rather than either-or category (Martin & White 2005:
138).

4. Materials & Methods
4.1. Material: The Podcast
For my material I chose the true crime podcast Crime Junkie. Crime Junkie is a weekly podcast
hosted by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat. The podcast is recorded in Indianapolis, United
States. The first podcast episode aired in December 2017 and new episodes are released at least
every Monday, but by subscribing to their online fan club, one gains access to more episodes
depending on your subscription. As of May 2019, the podcast enjoys a seventh position on
Apple iTunes Top Shows chart. It needs to be stated that neither host has a background in law
enforcement.
In a typical episode, Ashley dives into one crime that she has been researching, and she
tells the listeners everything related to the case, from the victim’s background, to their
disappearance or murder and to the police investigation and what it uncovers. During the
storytelling, Brit often chimes in with exclamations, questions and the occasional “full body
chills!”-comment, which has become something of a trademark for the podcast. A majority of
the crimes covered in the podcast remain unsolved, which adds to the suspense for the listener.
The crimes covered are most often ones that have happened in the United States, with the date
of the crime ranging from the 1970s to the present day and the investigations often spanning
decades. On their website, they describe their storytelling as “straightforward and free of rabbit
holes so the cases stay suspenseful and are easy to follow” (Crime Junkie Podcast 2019), which
I can attest to be the case. The podcast and its episodes can be found on iTunes, Spotify,
Patreon, or podcast sites.
I chose this particular podcast for a number of reasons. Mainly, the storytelling is
straightforward and focuses on the crime at hand, with little to no interruptions about matters
not concerning the crime. For my research, I viewed this trait to be of utter importance so that
my material was not tainted with anecdotes and comments about the hosts’ personal lives.
However, since there are two hosts, Ashley and Brit, there is an element of conversation to the
podcast, which is important as it provides the material with depth and emotions. While not
wanting the podcast to be full of personal anecdotes, the hosts professing their opinions on the
crime and investigation was necessary for my study. While Ashley tells the story, Brit’s
30

Ellen Seppälä
questions and exclamations act as instigators for Ashley to initiate a conversation about what
was just stated, which allows the hosts to briefly discuss the case. A third reason was that the
podcast is released from the United States and mainly features crimes that have occurred in the
country, which is of importance as I am researching the United States’ law enforcement.
Furthermore, in order to have the storytelling involve the police as much as possible, I decided
that it would be preferred to focus on cases that focused on the victims rather than the killers,
as one can assume that it is often in these cases that the police are discussed in a more critical
manner, i.e. if a case remains unsolved after years or decades. Lastly, Crime Junkie featured
episodes that were not too lengthy, as many other podcasts release episodes that are closer to
two hours long, which would have been too long for me to include multiple episodes from for
my analysis. In conclusion, Crime Junkie filled my criteria and therefore suited as material for
my current research.
Through the podcast’s life, the hosts have referred to their listeners, and themselves, as
‘crime junkies.’ On their website, they describe the typical crime junkie:
You are obsessed with all things crime related. It started out as a general interest
but now you have this true-crime-shaped-hole in your life that no amount of
radio segments, podcasts, or documentaries can fill. And the more true crime
media you consume the more you crave it. […] You’re the one telling your
friends “fun facts” about the most notorious murder that took place in the city
you’re visiting when all they want to talk about is where they’re getting dinner.
[…] And you’re pretty sure you missed your true life’s calling to be a detective.
(Crime Junkie Podcast 2019)
A crime junkie hence refers to a person who gets a thrill out of hearing, reading, or seeing
anything true crime related. And, as the description says, they feel they should have chosen
law enforcement as a career. This interest, to say the least, in crime and law enforcement is
something I draw upon in this study.
As of April 1st, 2019, the podcast has released 75 free episodes. Most episodes are full
episodes covering one crime, and some episodes are updates on crimes already covered, for
example, if the police uncover new evidence, make an arrest, or if the hosts are joined by an
interview subject who has a connection to an already covered case. These episodes are often
much shorter than full episodes and have not been used as material for the present study
because of their length and subject matter.
The podcast titles always feature the name of a victim or killer, and then a term that I
refer to as a theme for the episode. These themes act as a general description of what the case
31

Ellen Seppälä
covered is about and the ones featured on the podcast are: “Missing”, “Murdered,” “Serial
Killer,” “Captured,” “Wanted,” “Conspiracy,” “Update,” and “Infamous.” All of these themes
have been featured more than once. Themes that have only been featured once include:
“Mysterious Death Of,” “If I Go Missing,” “Expert On,” and “Adnan.” For my study, I only
chose episodes with the theme “Missing” or “Murdered,” as these are the most common themes
in the podcast with 52% of all episodes belonging to either theme; 16 “Missing” episodes and
23 “Murdered” episodes. Also, because of the nature of the themes, i.e. dealing with a missing
or a murdered person, I believe these themes to be the ones where the police’s presence is most
prevalent and therefore thought to provide the most material. That is to say, these episodes
feature the most detail as to who, what, where and when, and the investigation surrounding the
disappearance or murder.
The episode lengths vary considerably in the podcast. The shortest episode is episode
“35: Captured: Monster in Fort Wayne”, which is only 4:36 minutes long. The episode is the
hosts’ comment on the capturing of a killer of a 30-year-old unsolved murder that they had
covered earlier and is as such not a full-length episode but simply an update. These shorter
episodes, usually under the theme “Captured” or “Update,” are often released outside of the
show’s weekly schedule or simultaneously with another full-length episode. In contrast, the
longest episode is episode “70: Update: Angela Mischelle Lawless,” which is 1 hour and 46
minutes long. The episode is an update on the murder of Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless, where
the hosts first air their original episode from when they had covered the murder earlier (“34:
Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless”) followed by an interview with the man who was wrongfully
convicted of her murder. The average episode length is 39:27 for the 75 episodes released as
of April 1st, 2019, however, this does include the shorter “Captured” or “Update” episodes as
well as the longer interview episodes. Therefore, only looking at the “Missing” and
“Murdered” themed episodes, which were chosen for this study, the average episode length is
38:05 for the 39 episodes on those themes.
In order to narrow down the number of episodes chosen for this study further, as 39
episodes totaling about 40 minutes each would have been too large of a data pool, I decided to
filter the podcast on iTunes according to the most downloaded episodes as of April 1st. The
three top ones then were “1: Missing: Niqui McCown,” “2: Murdered: Laci Peterson,” and “75:
Missing: Rachel Cooke.” Incidentally, the top three included the first episode and the latest
episode. Therefore, to get a wider view of the podcast, four episodes in the themes “Missing”
or “Murdered” were chosen at random from the middle of the podcast’s timeline for my
material to span from the first to the middle to the most recent episode. Of my final seven
32

Ellen Seppälä
episodes, five belonged to the “Missing” theme and two belonged to the “Murdered” theme.
The average length for my episodes were 38:58, which is close to the average length for all
“Missing” and “Murdered” episodes. Table 1 includes information about the seven episodes.

Though there have been convictions in the cases of Laci Peterson and Angela ‘Mischelle’
Lawless, both convictions have been speculated upon. In the case of Lawless, the person
convicted was later released upon being proven innocent. Furthermore, for the case of Niqui
McCown, an arrest was going to be made when the perpetrator committed suicide, therefore a
conviction never happened, and even though his guilt is assumed, her remains have never been
found and her case remains open, as with all other missing person cases despite their being
significant leads and suspects in most cases.
4.2. Methods: Analyzing the podcast episodes
Two different methods were applied to analyze the material. First, a quantitative analysis was
conducted using corpus linguistics to gather the frequencies and distributions of lexical items
concerning law enforcement. Secondly, with help of the data from the corpus analysis, a
qualitative analysis was conducted on the material using appraisal theory. Using both a
quantitative and qualitative method of analysis enabled a more extensive and objective research
than if only one analysis would have been conducted. Where a quantitative method can provide
insight of frequencies and distribution, a qualitative method can provide insight into social
interaction, better answering questions of how and why. Together, these two methods built on
each other to provide strong and corroborating results.
4.2.1. Transcription of episodes
In order to be able to gather the seven episodes from the podcasts into a corpus, I listened to
and transcribed each of the episodes as they were only available in audio format. First, I listened
to each episode once without transcribing to get an overview of what was said and how. Then
33

Ellen Seppälä
I chose to use the free transcription program IBM Watson Speech to Text service (2019), which
allows you to upload audio files and the program transcribes them for you. However, the
program is not faultless, and so after receiving the rough transcriptions from it, I listened to
every episode again and corrected the transcriptions manually. This way I corrected any
misspelling or miswording the program had found or added words that it had completely
missed. I also manually added turn-taking markers for the hosts for my own benefit as the IBM
Watson program’s “Detect multiple speakers” function proved unsuccessful. The program also
failed to add correct punctuation, which I corrected for my own benefit, as well as interjections
and exclamations, such as “What!” and “Oh my god!” so I added both in brackets for the
purpose of being able to capture the emotions of the hosts when the story was being told. I
attach one transcript for reference in Appendix A of this thesis.
As can be seen in table 1, the average episode length in number of words – excluding
interjections, exclamations, and the hosts’ turn-taking markers – was 6,244 words. The longest
transcription with 9,827 words had over double the number of words as the shortest episode
with 4,548 words, which I expect will affect the results and it will be taken into account in the
discussion. The total number of words for my material was 45,702 words. It also needs to be
said that my corpus consisted of small and specialized samples of text and therefore my results
would not be as generalizable as results from a million-word corpus. However, using seven
episodes from different months and years allowed for looking at changes over a longer period
of time. Furthermore, having listened to all the “Missing” and “Murdered”-themed episodes of
the Crime Junkie podcast, I could attest to the fact that the findings were generalizable to this
podcast and these themes, as the way the hosts spoke and discussed was found to be similar in
the majority of the episodes for those two themes.
4.2.2. A note on analyzing audio recordings
Before continuing to the results of my analyses, it is important to briefly discuss the use of
audio material and its significance for this study. As podcasting is a way of making digital
recordings available for download, the emphasis is, naturally, on the spoken word. Despite the
fact that many podcasts may be scripted, the scripts are intended to be spoken rather than read
and podcast scripts are not readily available online for the listener. Furthermore, it is unknown
to the listener if, and when, a podcast host goes off script.
For my study I chose to transcribe the podcast episodes in order to create a corpus of
the material, for which the episodes need to be in written form. As one of my focuses was on
the terms used to discuss law enforcement, this was most easily studied using corpus
34

Ellen Seppälä
linguistics, hence my choice to do so. However, as appraisal theory was chosen as the
qualitative approach in my study, it is vital to note that the original audio recordings bear an
importance on the interpretation of the utterances in regard to appraisal or evaluation. When
studying appraisal, one cannot merely focus on written transcriptions as there might be certain
prosodic features that are only apparent in the original recordings that are vital to the
interpretation of the utterances. One of the key beliefs is that a speaker can express his or her
personal feelings and assessments on the topic in a different way in spoken discourse than
written discourse, and this includes personal attitudes as well (Biber & Staples 2014: 273).
Such feelings and assessments can be realized through prosodic features such as intonation and
stress. Furthermore, Wichmann (2005: 229) notes that speech does not only reveal a speaker’s
emotions but can also convey “complex interpersonal meanings” such as if the utterance is
intended to be, for example, friendly, rude, or condescending. This is similar to Martin’s (1995:
32) idea that evoked judgement is more difficult to interpret as it cannot be easily ascribed
according to particular lexical items. A speaker’s attitude towards the subject as such is
generated by what is said, how it is said and within which context it is said.
In order to keep the scope of this study as clear as possible, prosodic features will not
be taken into account in the quantitative analysis using corpus linguistics. In the quantitative
analysis the focus is mainly on the terms used for law enforcement and any meaning conveyed
with prosody was deemed as not of importance for that part of the study. However, for the
appraisal analysis of judgement, prosodic features, mainly tone of voice and stress, can be of
importance as they can highlight the speakers’ feelings and assessments of the topic of law
enforcement in more detail than what might be apparent from the written transcriptions. This
is most importantly the case for implicit judgement, whereby the judgement might not be as
obvious to the reader as it is dependent on the ideational position of the writer/speaker (Martin
1995: 32).
In the scope of this thesis, I have decided to focus on the written material in the appraisal
analysis but also keeping the original audio recordings as a secondary material in order to
include any intonation and stress that is deemed as important in the appraisal of the utterance.
If such is the case, this will be recorded in the Results chapter as follows: where falling
intonation was noticed this was marked with \ and where rising intonation was noted this was
marked with /. If certain word stress contributing to judgement was found it was marked with
capital letters.

4.3. Wordsmith analysis
For my corpus analysis, I used the software Wordsmith Tools version 5.0 to acquire
information on frequencies of different words for law enforcement in my material. The
program produces occurrences of the items in such a way that they may be assessed and
examined qualitatively within the program itself to find important semantic patterns and
identifying discourse functions (Mautner 2009).
Before searching the corpus, the lexical items to be searched needed to be specified.
The aim was to include synonyms, near-synonyms and hyponyms of law enforcement. As I
listened to all the episodes multiple times when transcribing the material, I had heard the
discussions and was able to pick out the terms the podcast hosts preferred to use when talking
of law enforcement. Therefore, the terms police, investigator, detective, sheriff, officer and
deputy were immediately chosen as terms to search with. Below is a definition of each included
term to show why these in particular were included in the analysis as terms for law enforcement
in my analysis.
Police (n.) – “the department of government concerned primarily with maintenance of public order,
safety, and health and enforcement of laws and possessing executive, judicial, and legislative powers”
(Merriam-Webster Dictionary, s.v. police). Thus, police is a general name for the force that is in charge
of “enforcing the law” and “detecting crime,” which includes the responsibility to investigate when it is
suspected that a crime has been committed.
Investigator (n.) – “One who investigates something” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, s.v. investigator).
As mentioned above, the need to investigate becomes apparent when something questionable happens,
hence, the word investigator alludes to the person doing the investigating. However, the word is not
synonymous to police, as one can investigate other instances than crimes, but in the circumstances of my
material being true crime, I conclude that the hosts’ use of the word refers to the investigation of a crime.
Detective (n.) – “One whose occupation it is to discover matters artfully concealed; particularly […] a
member of the police force employed to investigate specific cases, or to watch particular suspected
individuals or classes of offenders” (OED, s.v. detective (n.)). This word being chosen as a word that
signifies law enforcement is obvious from the definition. Detective implies someone who is part of the
police force and investigates a criminal case, therefore the use of the word in a true crime podcast’s
episodes is expected.
Sheriff (n.) – “The primary function of the modern sheriff’s department is law enforcement […] 93% of
sheriffs’ offices routinely investigate crimes” (McKee 2004: 2). As mentioned in the introduction of the
different types of law enforcement, sheriffs’ offices differ from police departments in many ways,

36

Ellen Seppälä
although both investigate crimes in their jurisdictions. As sheriffs mostly serve small and sparsely
populated jurisdictions, the word’s existence in some of the podcast episodes only signifies that those
cases happened in the jurisdiction of a sheriffs’ office rather than a police department. Therefore, the
word sheriff is included in my analysis because it is the representative of law enforcement and the main
investigative force in those cases.
Officer (n.) – “A person who holds a particular office, post, or place” (OED, s.v. officer (n.)). On its own,
the word officer does not warrant a place in my analysis, but in connection with the attribute police the
word becomes important. The definition of police officer is “a member of a police force” (MerriamWebster Dictionary, s.v. police officer) and it is hence an important word to include in my analysis.
Deputy (n.) – “A person appointed or nominated to act for another or others, esp. to hold office or
exercise authority instead of another” (OED, s.v. deputy (n.)). Often a name for an employee of a
sheriffs’ office and a subordinate to the sheriff in a county, town, or village. Synonymous to a police
officer.

After having read through the transcripts multiple times, I identified a few more terms to
include based on how they were used by the podcast hosts. These are law enforcement, cop,
P.D., sergeant, agent and P.I. The term law enforcement warrants no explanation, as it is
effectively the heading for all other terms described above, but definitions of the other terms
are given below.
Cop (n.) – “A policeman […] (orig. U.S.)” (OED, s.v. cop (n.5)) or “police officer” (Merriam-Webster
Dictionary, s.v. cop), a slang word for policeman/officer used mainly in the United States, and since the
podcast and the criminal cases discussed are from the United States, the inclusion of this slang term in
my analysis is justified.
P.D. – In the case of the podcast’s topic being true crime and the words in connection to this term in the
transcripts (see Appendix A), one can conclude that P.D. is an abbreviation for police department, as
defined in Urban Dictionary (UD, s.v. pd)
Sergeant (n.) – “An officer in a police force ranking in the U.S. just below a captain or sometimes
lieutenant” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, s.v. sergeant). Often paired with the attribute police to
distinguish the word from the military term of the same name. The term’s significance in law
enforcement and thus to my analysis is apparent by the definition.
Agent (n.) – “One who is authorized to act for or in the place of another: such as […] a representative,
emissary or official of a government” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, s.v. agent). In itself, the word
carries no connection to law enforcement, but when compounded with an attibute like FBI or CIA, which

37

Ellen Seppälä
are known law enforcement agencies in the United States, it becomes apparent that the word is a term
for a person who acts on behalf of an agency of this kind. Granted, there are many agencies that are not
in the law enforcement business who refer to their employees as agents, but in the context of my material
being true crime oriented, one can assume that any mention of an agent will be in in reference to a law
enforcement agency.
P.I. (n) – an abbreviation of private investigator, “a person not a member of a police force who is licensed
to do detective work” (Merriam-Webster Dictionary, s.v. private investigator).

The twelve terms presented above were searched with the Wordsmith Concord program. Also,
using the Keyword column in Wordsmith, the frequency of the terms in relation to all words
in the corpus were recorded. However, there was the issue of how to search for the terms, i.e.
which forms of the nouns to search for in order to get the correct results. The following table
(2) shows the search terms used to search in the program and an explanation of the words this
search term included. The forms chosen included the singular and plural alternatives of each
noun.

*Since I manually read through the transcripts I knew when the word PD came up and that it stood for ‘police
department’ and would be included in my analysis, I hence decided to write it as PD in my transcripts rather than
P.D. to make it easier for myself when I searched with the term in Wordsmith.

One important element to note was that when searching for some of these terms, including
officer and sergeant, there was the possibility of overlap with another word, e.g. police sergeant
and police officer. Because many say police officer or police sergeant rather than simply officer
or sergeant, a manual analysis of the occurrences of the term police was done to exclude the
occurrences where the term was a modifier to either officer or sergeant. This was simple to
accomplish with Wordsmith’s function of showing the most common collocates for the
39

Ellen Seppälä
occurrences. In the results section, I mention how many, if any, occurrences were excluded
from the police search in order to be counted in another term’s search.
4.4. Appraisal analysis
For this study, as mentioned, a qualitative research approach needed to be chosen in order for
the analysis of the podcast episodes to be further developed to not only include what vocabulary
was used to refer to law enforcement. It was decided that a deeper analysis was required that
would encompass the transcripts as a whole within which law enforcement is discussed to
analyze the podcast hosts’ evaluation and appraisal of law enforcement. As detailed in the
chapter on the theoretical framework, the appraisal model (Marin & White 2005) was chosen
for this analysis. However, as the model is broad and encompasses multiple systems and
subcomponents, the scope of the analysis had to be narrowed down.
Upon studying the appraisal model, it was decided that the subcomponent most relevant
to my study was judgement. Judgement focuses on evaluation of human behavior, whether
negative or positive, and the focus of my study was the discussion of law enforcement in the
podcast episodes. Since law enforcement, essentially, refers to the people that enforce the law,
assessing evaluation of human behavior in this sense was deemed fitting. Since judgement is
concerned with language that praises or criticizes either actions, sayings, beliefs, etc. of
individuals or groups, concentrating on how the podcast hosts appraise and evaluate law
enforcement in regard to Martin and White’s (2005) subcomponent of judgement seemed like
the perfect fit for my study.
It is however important to note that this analysis aimed at finding appraisals of
judgement, but it did not presuppose that every statement in the podcast episodes where law
enforcement was mentioned would be an appraisal of judgement, either negative or positive.
My hypothesis was that there would be more negative values of judgement than positive ones
in relation to law enforcement, but this hypothesis did allow for the fact that there would be
cases where neither judgement value was found.
Since the section on judgement within the theoretical framework chapter was brief,
what follows in the next section is a more in-depth explanation of the subcomponent of
Attitude. Subsequently, a section on the methods with which my material was analyzed in
regard to judgement will follow.

40

Ellen Seppälä
4.4.1. Judgement
To further explain the appraisal of judgement, the five types to which an evaluation of
judgement can belong to can be explained as follows (Martin & White 2005: 52; Martin 2000:
156):
Normality – how special someone is

(social esteem)

Capacity – how capable someone is

(social esteem)

Tenacity – how resolute someone is

(social esteem)

Veracity – how truthful someone is

(social sanction)

Propriety – how ethical someone is

(social sanction)

As mentioned in the theoretical framework chapter, judgement can be divided into two
different groups, judgements of social esteem and judgements of social sanction. Social esteem
tends to be observed in oral culture whereas social sanction is more solidified in writing (Martin
& White 2005: 53). This refers to the fact that people tend to discuss people in regard to
normality, capacity and tenacity with other people, often blending it with humor and using such
discussions to form social networks. The social sanction of veracity and propriety can be said
to be codified in rules, regulations and laws about how to behave. Appraising someone within
these parameters can be said to evaluate a person’s ethics and civic duty (Martin & White 2005:
53).
The most obvious examples of judgement might be evaluations by reference to systems
of legality vs. illegality, morality vs. immorality, or politeness vs. impoliteness. As can be seen
in the contrasts above, it is important to note that there are both negative and positive
evaluations of judgement. This should not come as a surprise, as human behavior can be either
negative or positive. For social esteem positive versus negative evaluation refers to traits that
we admire versus ones we criticize, while for social sanction it is seen as behavior we praise
versus behavior we condemn (Martin 2000: 156). These groups can be explained as two sides
of who can help someone who is evaluated to be too negative of either esteem or sanction; too
much negative esteem might require the help of a therapist while too much negative sanction
might require the help of a lawyer (Martin & White 2005: 53; Martin 2000: 156; Martin 1995:
30).
Furthermore, judgement can be distinguished in two ways: inscribed (or explicit) or
invoked/evoked (or implicit) judgement. Explicit judgement can be seen to be judgement
carried out by the means of a lexical item on its own, e.g. horribly, badly, powerfully etc.
Implicit judgement, on the other hand, refers to certain capabilities to evoke judgement with
41

Ellen Seppälä
the help of simply stating ‘facts’ or providing information, often referred to as ‘tokens of
judgement’. These are not in themselves values of judgement; yet they rely on the speaker and
listener sharing values such as social, cultural or ideological positions in order for the listener
to be able to assess the statement as the speaker intended (Thompson 2008: 171; Martin 1995:
32). As such, evoked statements of judgement can also be used to assert group membership,
because if the listener understands the value behind a statement and accepts it, he or she
displays that they are a part of that same group as the speaker.
Take for example the statement “he wears socks with sandals”. It might seem like a
statement simply providing information about someone’s footwear, although many listeners –
especially in the Western world – would recognize the statement as a negative judgement of
someone’s fashion sense in pairing socks with open-toed sandals and unawareness of social
norms in regard to that particular combination. The statement thus belongs to the normality
judgement type. Similarly, in Finland, calling someone “Jonne” whose name is not Jonne,
could to an outsider simply be a nickname for a person, but for the Finnish younger generation,
it signifies a negative value of someone who is an annoying and loud male teenager aged
between 12 and 18 driving around on his moped and drinking energy drinks. In this case, the
requirement for assessing the statement as containing a negative value is to have an insight into
the Finnish cultural and social norms of high school.
4.4.2. Analyzing judgement
Firstly, it needs to be noted that appraisal analysis contains certain dilemmas, according to
Martin (1995). Most importantly, when analyzing judgement, researchers should be aware of
not judging the ideational tokens in the text on their own terms. Whereas it might be easier to
read inscribed judgement, as this should be clearer from the writer’s intensions, it is more
difficult to notice evoked judgement as the writer wants it to be interpreted (Martin 1995: 32).
Martin (1995: 33) further emphasizes that it is possible to read any text judgmentally, whether
this was the intention of the writer or not. How it is judged and how much of it is judged is a
matter of interpretation done by the reader based on his or her social and ideological position.
That being said, the reader should keep the intention of the writer in mind while analyzing a
powerful text, in order for the analysis to be as unbiased as possible. This has been the aim for
my analysis.
In this section I will detail the methods used for my analysis of the podcast episodes for
appraisals of judgement. Below I include two tables (3 and 4) adapted from Martin and White

42

Ellen Seppälä
(2005: 53) that illustrate some of the lexical items that were used when deducing judgement.
These were used as the starting point for my analysis.

(Adapted from Martin & White 2005: 53.)

However, Martin and White (2005: 52) note that attitudinal meaning is dependent on the
context, which means that one cannot evaluate discourse simply based on lexical items, as was
also seen in the distinction between inscribed and invoked appraisal above. A lexical item can
be either negative or positive depending on the whole sentence or paragraph in which it is
located and in regard to someone’s values and experiences. White (2001b) further points out
that judgement can be realized as adverbials (honestly, stupidly), attributes or epithets (he’s
very brave, a corrupt official), nominals (a hero, a brutal man) or verbs (to cheat, to sin).
Having already used Wordsmith to find the lexical items in the episodes where law
enforcement was mentioned, I had the groundwork for the second analysis completed as these
were to be my focus points for the second analysis as well. However, as Martin and White
(2005: 52) stated, the lexical items surrounding the term are not solely able to signify values
of judgement, and therefore I expanded my area of analysis to the sentence within which the
term was located. This allowed for the vocabulary and tone of the sentence as a whole to
influence the analysis. In certain cases, multiple mentions of law enforcement existed within a
short paragraph or dialogue between the podcast hosts. In such cases, the entire paragraph or
44

Ellen Seppälä
dialogue was analyzed together as a whole rather than analyzing the terms as separate
statements.
My analysis was done as follows. First, I read through each sentence containing a
mention of law enforcement and coded if I found any cases of inscribed judgement in an Excelfile. Having found a judgement, it was coded using one of the five types of judgement
introduced earlier in this study, i.e. normality (norm), capacity (cap), tenacity (ten), veracity
(ver), and propriety (prop). It should be noted that a sentence could contain multiple types of
judgement, but in this case and in order to keep the scope of study as narrow as possible, it was
decided to only code one type for all occurrences. In cases such as these, I chose to code the
type that was most obvious in the context.
It was also further acknowledged whether the judgement was positive or negative using
the symbols + and –. These were also recorded in the Excel-file which contained the appraising
items: i.e. the lexical items within which judgement was found; the appraiser: who uttered the
judgement; as well as the appraised: who the judgement was focused on. Since my analysis
was focused on the hosts’ appraisal of law enforcement, if any occurrences were found where
either the appraiser or appraised did not match my focus, these were eliminated from the
analysis.
I first conducted one analysis for inscribed judgement, being of the clearer kind of the
types of judgement to find, as mentioned above (Martin 1995: 32). After this, the material was
reviewed again to analyze for ideational tokens which could contribute to evoked judgement.
In this second analysis, clear attention was paid to the original podcast recordings in order to
not ascribe judgement according to my own social and ideological position, but rather the
positions of the podcast hosts. This was done by listening to the paragraph were a presumed
token of judgement was found in order to take into account possible prosodic features, i.e.
intonation and stress, used by the speaker(s). Having completed the analysis of evoked
judgement, the material was reviewed once more for the third time and each judgement
evaluated and interpreted again, in order for the analysis to be comprehensive and exhaustive.
The results of both the appraisal analysis and the Wordsmith analysis are presented in the next
chapter.

5. Results
5.1. Wordsmith analysis
As mentioned in section 4.2.2., the terms for law enforcement searched for in the corpus
material, i.e. the podcast transcripts, were: police, investigator, detective, sheriff, officer,
deputy, cop, law enforcement, PD, sergeant, agent and P.I. The terms were also searched for
in their plural forms. I will now detail my results from the Wordsmith analysis.
In total, there were 307 occurrences of the terms for law enforcement, i.e. the hosts
mentioned law enforcement a total of 307 times across the seven podcast episodes. Of the total
number of words in the seven episodes, words pertaining to law enforcement accounted for
0.67% of all words.
Table 5 below shows the occurrences per term and their percentage of the total 307
occurrences and table 6 shows the occurrences for the “Other” category, which includes terms
with fewer than under 10 occurrences each. The term most often used to refer to law
enforcement was police with a total of 163 occurrences in all seven episodes. This term
accounted for 53% of all terms for law enforcement. The term with the least number of
occurrences was agent with one occurrence in episode 27: Misty Copsey.

Figure 5 below shows the total number of occurrences per episode and episode length. The
episode with the largest number of occurrences of law enforcement terms was episode 34:
Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless with 91 occurrences, which accounted for 30% of total
occurrences of the terms and 0.93% of total words in the episode. The episode with the fewest
number of occurrences was episode 40: Leah Roberts with 25 occurrences of the terms,
accounting for 8% of total occurrences and 0.45% of total words in the episode.

Misty Copsey 0.82%, Angela Lawless 0.93%, Leah Roberts 0.45% and Rachel Cooke 0.70%.
(As counted from the total word counts for the episodes that can be found in Table 1 in section
47

Ellen Seppälä
4.1.). The figure shows that despite there being differences in episode lengths, the total
occurrences of law enforcement terms in relation to episode length is similar across the
episodes, always accounting for under 1% of total words.
Figure 6 below details the number of occurrences for each term per episode. The term
police was used most in episode 2: Laci Peterson, investigator was used most in episode 34:
Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless and episode 27: Misty Copsey, detective was used most in episode
15: Katelin Akens, and sheriff, officer and deputy were used most in episode 34: Angela
‘Mischelle’ Lawless. The episode with most occurrences of the ‘Other’ category terms was
episode 27: Misty Copsey.

5.2. Appraisal analysis
The appraisal analysis according to the method described in 4.2.3 resulted in the following
findings. Of the 307 mentions of law enforcement lexical items that the Wordsmith analysis
found, 63 occurrences were found to be judgements of law enforcement by the podcast hosts.
This accounts for 21% of all law enforcement terms containing judgement. As explained
previously the research was only interested in appraisals of judgements where the appraiser
was the podcast host and the appraised was law enforcement. As such, 244 occurrences were
found to not contain judgement of this kind, but it should be noted that this does not mean that
there was no other form of judgement in these other occurrences, i.e. where the appraised was
48

90

Ellen Seppälä
someone else. The podcast hosts sometimes evaluate the suspects or bystanders in the episodes,
as this example from episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless where the host is referring to a
suspect named Mark:
He said he gave police that name just ten days following the crime, but this man’s name was never
released, so I have to assume, that he was cleared or more likely, never existed, because Mark is
bananas.

Or another example where the hosts are evaluating a bystander in episode 27: Misty Copsey.
This Cory person was not known to the victim or her family, according to the podcast hosts,
before her disappearance, but he was convinced he knew who the murderer was:
Still, Cory didn’t care, he was totally obsessed. He made threats to carry out like vigilante justice and
he would even send people undercover to record conversations with Randy.

All the data collected in the appraisal analysis where the podcast hosts evaluated law
enforcement is included in Appendix B.

Table 7 shows the total number of occurrences (63) of judgement by the podcast hosts of the
total 307 occurrences of law enforcement terms in the episodes. Furthermore, the table shows
how the occurrences were divided between the five types of evaluation of judgement. In
addition to this, table 7 also shows the total occurrences by polarity, i.e. if judgement was
positive or negative. The overall division into polarity types is fairly equal, with there only
being slightly more negative than positive judgement; 57% negative to 43% positive. As can
be seen from the table, almost all types of evaluation included marginally more negative
occurrences than positive ones, except capacity.
49

Ellen Seppälä
There are however differences in the results between types. As can be seen, the most
frequent type used was that of capacity, relating to the capability or competence of law
enforcement. This is also the only type with more positive occurrences than negative, which
suggests that the hosts are fairly likely to think that law enforcement is more capable than
uncapable. Example sentences 1 to 6 from the podcast that were found to include judgements
of capacity are shown below. After the example sentences, a note about whether the judgement
is seen as positive or negative is added. Furthermore, lexical items from table 3 (see chapter
4.2.3.2, Martin and White’s 2005: 53) for the corresponding judgement type are added as a
means of illustrating how the judgement was deduced. The episode within which this sentence
was uttered by the podcast hosts is also given. A lexical item is given for how the sentence can
be seen to include judgement according to table 3. However, since the podcast episodes are
audio recordings, analyzing for evoked judgement meant including prosodic features, if these
were of importance to the judgement in the utterances. Therefore, some examples include a
note on prosody found in the utterances.

Police have no leads but again even in this time where they aren’t moving the case forward, they
still aren't tracking down other leads. To me this would have been a good time if the Scott angle
wasn’t panning out, or you at least weren’t getting anything new and it wasn’t enough to convict
him, it wasn’t up to take him to trial. At least spend your time looking at the other angles
Negative judgement: incompetent, unproductive
Prosody: NEW; AT LEAST spend your time / looking
Episode 2: Laci Peterson

3.

Now police, like you and I, and like I'm sure everyone listening, are super confused by James
Positive judgement: insightful
Prosody: SUPER CONFUSED
Episode 15: Katelin Akens

4.

But there really is still nothing being done. Police are finally considering Misty a missing and
endangered person, but they're dragging their feet and still haven't done any real investigative work.
Negative judgement: incompetent, unproductive

Deputies still had not a single idea on what the motive would be, or why she would have pulled over
her car. I mean, they had more questions than answers, and even a month into the investigation,
they didn’t have a single prime suspect
Negative judgement: unaccomplished
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless

6.

So police have this sketch, but something isn’t sitting right with them, and because guy number one
didn’t say anything about her leaving with some guy named Barry, in fact some guy named Barry
never came up. Now all that police will tell us is they think that this Barry character is completely
fabricated.
Positive judgement: sensible, competent
Episode 40: Leah Roberts

The second most frequent type found in the episodes was tenacity, relating to how resolute or
bold someone is. This is interesting in regard to the topic of law enforcement in the podcast as
it alludes to the importance of law enforcement agents’ dependability and thoroughness. People
need to be able to trust that law enforcement are taking their cases seriously and evaluating
their tenacity questions that trust. The type of tenacity had more negative evaluation than
positive, signifying a lack of trust. Examples 7 to 11 illustrate sentences of tenacity in the
podcast.
7.

And at this point I think police are even getting concerned as well …
Positive judgement: persevering, adaptable
Episode 1: Niqui McCown

8.

I know, but again, it’s not like police weren’t just investigating this lead, they really weren’t
investigating anything. Not talking to her friends, not talking to Rheuben, and not talking to this guy
who got convicted of picking up a girl, almost exactly where Misty was last seen, raping her and
attempting to murder her.
Negative judgement: unreliable, undependable
Episode 27: Misty Copsey

9.

This is huge for the investigators and prosecutors, so they put together a photo line-up and they go
back to Mark Abbott, who’s clearly like the most reliable witness, wink, wink, sarcasm, no he’s not.
Negative judgement: rash, unreliable
Prosody: CLEARLY; / most reliable \ witness

10. Even the investigators that were first on the scene thought that she pulled over for someone she
knew, and she did not know Josh. But in the sheriff’s mind, this was a, but a minute detail. In the
sheriff’s mind, Josh fit the profile of a killer.
Negative judgement: reckless, willful
Prosody: a / minute detail
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless
11. But for every like bad prosecutor and bad investigator, it is so heart-warming to know that there are
a couple of good guys out there.
Positive judgement: loyal
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless

There were 10 occurrences of the type of veracity, which relates to honesty and credibility.
Sadly, there were more negative occurrences than positive ones implying that the podcast hosts
found law enforcement slightly more dishonest than honest, which is unsettling since law
enforcement is tasked with upholding law and order. Therefore, being seen as dishonest could,
on a deeper level, mean that they themselves are not following the law. These findings can also
directly be seen to correlate with people’s trust and confidence in the police, because if police
are seen as dishonest that can mean they are seen as untrustworthy. Examples 12 to 15 are
sentences with judgements of veracity.
12. So once police like, and, and obviously police know more than the public does, they ruled this out a
couple of days in.
Positive judgement: credible
Prosody: know \ MORE
Episode 15: Katelin Akens
13. Because growing up you think, or at least, some of us think that police are honest, and you think
that the whole reason we have this justice system and proven innocent ‘til guilty is because that’s
how it actually works.
Negative judgement: dishonest
Prosody: / you think; HONEST
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless

Ellen Seppälä
14. If one thing I’ve learned the more I’ve done this podcast, looked into wrongful convictions, a lot of
times if you don’t have honest prosecutors and you don’t have honest detectives, they will actually
choose not to test evidence if they think there’s any chance that it’s not going to point to their suspect.
Negative judgement: dishonest
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless
15. The police knew aaaa loot more than they were letting on. I am shocked at how much they were able
to keep quiet in this case.
Negative judgement: deceitful, deceptive
Prosody: / a \ LOT
Episode 75: Rachel Cooke

The last type that had any occurrences in the podcast episodes was propriety, i.e. relating to
morality and correctness. The type of judgement that was not found at all in the podcast
episodes, is normality, relating to how unusual someone is. This can be taken to suggest that
the podcast hosts do not discuss whether law enforcement are behaving normally or unusually,
not evaluating the norms of the occupation. But the discussion of propriety or how moral and
ethical law enforcement is, is interesting. Law enforcement is tasked with upholding the law
and can therefore also be seen as being tasked with “making the world a better place”, law
enforcement agents should be inherently good and righteous. Showing compassion and
empathy can be said to be the driving force for being a good police officer (Scherman 2019).
Thus, the podcast hosts evaluating law enforcement’s morality more negatively is worrying.
Sentences from the podcast episodes that were found to include the type of propriety are
illustrated by examples 16-19.
16. So all of this went to the police, the family would say “Hey, you know detective Allen Brocchini, to
whoever, that go talk to these people, they said they’ve seen Laci, maybe this will help find her.
They’re assuming that the police are vetting all of this, what we learned later is, I don’t think they
did a great job of that even, early on they really have their sights set on Scott.
Negative judgement: unjust, bad
Episode 2: Laci Peterson
17. The police decide like okay we can’t let Laci’s family find out this way, we have to tell them.
Positive judgement: kind, caring
Episode 2: Laci Peterson

Ellen Seppälä
18. The deputy basically tells him, even if we found her, we wouldn’t tell you or her mother where she
is.
Negative judgement: evil
Prosody: YOU; MOTHER
Episode 27: Misty Copsey
19. So the sheriff and the prosecutor charged him with the murder, they say, you know, we can’t prove
you were here, but we can’t prove you were away, so that’s really not a hang up for us.
Negative judgement: unjust
Episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless

Table 8 shows the division of the occurrences of judgement per episode. The episode with the
most occurrences of judgement from the podcast hosts towards law enforcement was episode
27: Misty Copsey with 27 occurrences or 27% of the total 63 occurrences. The episode with
the least occurrences of judgement was episode 40: Leah Roberts with 2 or 3% of total
occurrences followed closely by episode 75: Rachel Cooke with 3 or 5% of total occurrences.

Table 8 also shows the occurrences by type per episode. Most judgements of capacity and
propriety were found in episode 27: Misty Copsey with 7 occurrences for capacity (25% of
total occurrences for capacity) and 5 occurrences (56%). Most judgements of tenacity and
veracity were found in episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless with 7 occurrences (39%) for
tenacity and 4 occurrences (50%) for veracity. Episode 40: Leah Roberts was the only episode
to have occurrences of only one type with 2 occurrences of capacity. All other episodes had at
least two judgement types present. The table (8) also shows the polarity by episode, whereby
only one episode, episode 1: Niqui McCown, had more occurrences of positive judgement than
54

Ellen Seppälä
negative judgement, 5 occurrences to 2 occurrences. The episode with most negative
judgement was episode 27: Misty Copsey with 14 occurrences or 39% of all negative
judgements, and the episode with most positive judgement was episode 15: Katelin Akens with
9 occurrences or 34% of all positive judgement. Episode 15: Katelin Akens was the only
episode to have only positive judgement and no negative judgement (9+ to 0–), whereas
episode 75: Rachel Cooke was the only episode to only have negative judgement and no
positive judgement (0+ to 3–). All other episodes had occurrences of both negative and positive
judgement. Furthermore, the table highlights the total word count per episode and the
percentage of judgements in each episode in regard to total word count. This is depicted in
order to show that though episode length has an effect on the number of occurrences, it does
not affect the proportions of types and polarity of the evaluations. Episode length will be further
discussed in the next section.
Figure 7 below details the occurrences of law enforcement terms in each episode next
to the judgements found for each episode. This shows that the podcast hosts mentioned law
enforcement multiple times, but evaluations of judgement were not found as frequently. The
longest episode with the most occurrences of law enforcement terms, episode 34: Angela
‘Mischelle’ Lawless, had the second most occurrences of judgement. Of all the times the
podcasts hosts mentioned law enforcement in the episode, only 15% of those mentions were
evaluations of judgement. However, in episode 27: Misty Copsey 27% of occurrences of law
enforcement terms were found to be evaluations of judgements. This shows a clear difference
between episodes. The rest of the episodes had the following percentages of judgement in
relation to the terms of law enforcements:
Episode 1: Niqui McCown: 26%
Episode 2: Laci Peterson: 30%
Episode 15: Katelin Akens: 28%
Episode 40: Leah Roberts: 8%
Episode 75: Rachel Cooke: 9%
These figures show that the majority of episodes (4) had around 30% of evaluations of
judgement of all law enforcement terms in their respective episodes.

The next section will discuss the results presented in this section and relate them to the
background and the topics that have been discussed throughout this thesis.

6. Discussion
This section will examine the results presented in the previous chapter in relation to the research
questions and topics introduced in the background. This will be done in two parts; separately
for the corpus linguistics analysis and for the appraisal analysis. Furthermore, I will discuss the
implications of the findings of the appraisal analysis for podcasts’ influence on its audience.
This section will also discuss limitations of the present study and suggestions for future
research.
6.1. Law enforcement vocabulary
The aim of the corpus analysis was to discover what vocabulary the hosts used in their podcast
when discussing law enforcement and which lexical items for law enforcement were the most
prominently used. The findings from the corpus analysis where then used to assist in the
appraisal analysis. Reading the podcasts to find the lexical items for law enforcement used in
the podcast showed that there are multiple different terms for law enforcement in American
English. As was noted in the background chapters, there are multiple different branches and
agencies of law enforcement and this can also be seen by the abundance of different terms used
to describe law enforcement in the podcast. Terms used to describe law enforcement
professionals from all three main types of law enforcement – local (municipal and county),
state and federal – were mentioned in the seven studied podcast episodes. Most terms can be
attributed to multiple types of law enforcement, but some terms are often associated with one
specific type. For example, PD is associated with municipal law enforcement, sheriff and
deputy are associated with county law enforcement and agent is often attributed to federal law
enforcement.
It should come as no surprise that the most prominently used term for law enforcement
was police, which accounted for 53% of all occurrences (see Table 4). The term is derived from
the medieval Latin term politia ‘state, government’ (Oxford English Dictionary s.v. police (n.))
and multiple different languages around the world use a variation of the same term i.e. Swedish
polis, Spanish policía, Swahili polisi, Turkish polis and more. The term is thus universally
well-known, which might explain why the podcast hosts use it so frequently. Furthermore,
police is also a verb used often to describe the action that law enforcement professionals
undertake when working, i.e. policing.

57

Ellen Seppälä
There is also a relatively high percentage of the term sheriff used in the episodes. This
suggests that multiple cases covered by the podcast hosts happened in places in the United
States that were under a county sheriff’s jurisdiction. As was observed previously most
sheriff’s offices are small, serve large and sparsely populated rural areas, and have less
personnel than their urban counterparts (McKee 2004: 432). This may mean that they have
limited resources to investigate larger crimes. In their study Senjo and Heward (2007: 218)
found that of their participants, every three out of four sheriff's deputies had a second job in
addition to working full-time as a law enforcement officer. They explain the reason for this as
relating to the insufficient amount of work and low salary. Rural sheriff’s deputies spend less
energy patrolling sparsely populated areas with little crime than their urban counterparts, and
thus they have leftover energy to have a second job to earn an extra salary. Thus, one might
think that when faced with a situation requiring a lot of resources and investigative work, some
rural sheriff’s offices might not have the capacity to handle such cases. However, I have found
no research indicating that sheriff’s offices had higher unsolved cases than urban police
departments.
It is important to note that 50% of all occurrences of law enforcement terms were found
in two episodes. This indicates that there is a clear influence of the length of episode as these
two episodes were also the longest episodes (see Table 1). It can be concluded that the longer
the episode, the more the podcast hosts mentioned law enforcement. This pattern almost
continued through my material as the third and fourth longest episodes also feature the third
and fourth most mentions of law enforcement. Although, all episodes had under 1% of law
enforcement terms (see Figure 5), suggesting that despite there being more terms for law
enforcement in the longer episodes, the difference is proportionally marginal.
However, the third shortest episode had the least number of occurrences of law
enforcement terms. Since my material only consists of seven episodes, it is difficult to say if
this is a pattern throughout the podcast and for what reason. One could argue that because the
podcast focuses on crime it is understandable that law enforcement plays a central role and the
longer the episode is, the longer the discussion of the crime is, and hence also the discussion
of the law enforcement agency in charge of solving the crime. Since the topic of this study is a
true crime podcast and the way law enforcement is portrayed in the podcast, it should be
apparent that law enforcement is discussed frequently. Furthermore, interestingly, the themes
of the episodes might have had an influence on frequency. The two episodes convering
murders, namely episode 2: Laci Peterson and episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless,
featured the third and second most occurrences of law enforcement terms. This indicates that
58

Ellen Seppälä
law enforcement was discussed more in the episodes where a clear murder had been committed,
as opposed to the missing person episodes where bodies had never been found.
Of the seven podcast episodes, several episodes featured multiple different terms used
for law enforcement (see Figure 6), which indicates that there was different vocabulary used
in the sources to what the podcast hosts used when discussing the case. This also shows that
there is a lot of variation between which terms to use for law enforcement and that other factors
apart from simply the type of law enforcement might have an influence on the choice of
vocabulary. Something that could be further studied within the medium of podcasting in
general is which term for law enforcement is chosen based on which factors. It should
furthermore be stated that each episode has its own term that is used the most. In six of the
episodes – i.e. in all except one episode – the most frequently used term is police, as it did
account for 53% of all occurrences. In the seventh episode the most frequently used term is
sheriff, again signifying that the type of law enforcement being county law enforcement had
an effect on the vocabulary.
6.2. Judgement of law enforcement
The results of the appraisal analysis show that law enforcement (Table 7) was judged in a
slightly more negative light by the podcast hosts in the episodes, as my hypothesis stated.
However, the difference between negative and positive judgement in the episodes was not as
distinct as suspected. As the analysis focused solely on the podcast hosts’ own attitude to law
enforcement, this excluded all terms of law enforcement where judgement was not realized.
These included when the podcast hosts read out statements given by police, depictions of
suspects, listing evidence, and more. The results in Figure 7 do show that of all the terms of
law enforcement found in the episodes, only about 30% or in some cases under 10% of all
occurrences were found to be evaluations of judgement.
Of the types of judgement, either belonging to social esteem or social sanction, the type
with most occurrences was that of capacity. This was to be expected as capacity deals with a
person’s capability or competence, and law enforcement is a profession. It is self-evident that
a law enforcement professional’s capability of performing his or her duties should be
mentioned in regard to judgement. Therefore, it is not surprising that with this type of
judgement, there was more positive judgement than negative judgement. This suggests that
although the podcast hosts are more negative of law enforcement in general, they deem law
enforcement officers as slightly more capable than not in performing their duties.
59

Ellen Seppälä
It is also not surprising that normality, that is how normal a person seems to be, was
not found at all in the podcast episodes. One might say that the topic of normality in relation
to law enforcement is seldom present in a murder or missing person investigation, and that if
it were a topic, it would certainly not be a very relevant one. In all other types of judgement
there was more negative than positive judgement. Propriety, i.e. how ethical or good someone
is, received the most negative judgement in relation to positive judgement, which can be
interpreted as signifying that the podcast hosts judged law enforcement as inherently evil and
unmoral. Although there were only 8 negative judgements of propriety, it can still be said that
discussing law enforcement as an unmoral or corrupt entity is worrying, despite the low number
of occurrences in regard to the total word count per episode. Since law enforcement is an entity
meant to enforce the law, it is troubling when law enforcement is discussed in relation to
corruption, which is against the law.
What is also interesting in the findings in Table 7 is that there are more occurrences of
judgements of social esteem than of social sanction. In section 4.2.3.1 it was noted that
judgements of social esteem are more apparent in oral cultures – as the podcast might be seen
to represent – as people discuss human behavior as a way of building social networks, but
judgements of social sanction are more codified in rules and laws of how to behave. One might
think that discussing law enforcement would involve more judgements of social sanction as
the profession is literally focused on rules, laws and punishment, and there are strict moral
rules on how to behave in this profession. As was seen in the section on trust and confidence
in policing, public perception of law enforcement decreased after the maltreatment of African
Americans by American law enforcement came to light by the Black Lives Matter movement
(Norman 2017). This one could say shows that people do not take the mistreatment of other
people lightly, and that law enforcement is expected to be at a higher standard than the wider
public in regard to behavior.
Looking at the findings in Table 8, it becomes apparent that episode length had an effect
on the occurrences of judgement found in the episodes. Similarly to what was noticed in the
previous section on terms of law enforcement, in the appraisal analysis longer episodes featured
more occurrences of judgement. This was the case for the majority of the episodes included in
the analysis. The comparison between terms of law enforcement found in the episodes with the
number of judgements recorded seen in Figure 7, shows that the episodes with the most
occurrences of law enforcement terms also have the most occurrences of judgement. And as
Table 8 shows, they are also the longest episodes. Hence one can draw the conclusion that a
longer episode equaled more occurrences of law enforcement terms, which in turn equaled
60

Ellen Seppälä
more judgement. So, by looking at the longest episodes of the podcast there might be more
judgement apparent. It can be concluded that the longer a case drags on, the more opportunity
for judgement alluding to wrongdoings appear. It is understandable that when an episode is
longer, it means that the podcast hosts have more to say, which could indicate that the case is
more complex or involves more details compared to other shorter episodes as it takes longer to
explain or there is more to discuss. If a criminal case is complex to explain, it might mean that
the investigation has in turn has been difficult. This might allude to the fact why longer episodes
have more judgement. This might not be simply because the episodes are longer, but because
the criminal cases covered are more complicated and the podcast hosts might have issue with
some of the details of the case.
It is also important to note that not all episodes featured both positive and negative
evaluation of judgement. One episode featured only positive judgement whereas another
featured only negative judgement. This suggests that despite there being more negative
judgement overall in all the episodes combined, it is not abundant in all cases. The evaluation
of judgement of law enforcement is clearly dependent upon the circumstances of the case, as
in episode 34: Angela ‘Mischelle’ Lawless. A man was convicted of her murder in 1994 but
was acquitted in 2010 after serving 16 years in prison for a murder he did not commit
(Weinberg 2019). This acquittal definitely has a bearing on the way law enforcement is
evaluated by the podcast hosts in the episode and is also most likely the reason there is so much
negative judgement in this specific episode. My material shows that the podcast hosts do not
have only one specific way of evaluating law enforcement as there is such variation between
the episodes.
It is important to consider if the themes of the episodes might have had an influence on
the results of my analysis. My material features two themes: two episodes covered murders
and the remaining five covered missing persons. The distinction between the two being that in
the two ‘Murdered’ episodes, the bodies of the victims were found, whereas in the other five
‘Missing’ episodes, no body had been recovered when the episodes aired. The two episodes
with the most judgement were not of the same theme; one covered a murder and the other a
missing person. However, the other ‘Murdered’ episode featured the third most occurrences of
judgement, indicating that there was more judgement in relation to ‘Murdered’ episodes.
Consequently, both ‘Murdered’ episodes contained more negative judgement than positive
judgement.
The complete results of the appraisal analysis of evaluations of judgement are included
in Appendix B. The appendix has all data from the appraisal analysis and can be referred to for
61

Ellen Seppälä
the extensive results. The analysis concludes that 34 occurrences were found to be
inscribed/explicit judgement that is deducible from lexical items on their own (Martin & White
2005: 53). However, it needs to be said that when it comes to language use in context, as this
case is about, a lexical item’s attitudinal meaning will vary according to the context within
which it is (Ibid.: 52). Not surprisingly then, the context of law enforcement and crime in
relation to the keywords found in the analysis is interesting. Many cases featured the same
keywords of judgement, namely competent/incompetent, unreliable, dishonest, and unjust.
Looking at these keywords, it becomes clear that in relation to law enforcement, they are very
negative. The podcast hosts’ discussion of law enforcement hence seems to circle around issues
of competency, reliability, honesty, and justness. It might not come as a surprise that a law
enforcement professional is judged in regard to these terms, but it is worrisome when the
evaluation is negative. As previously stated, law enforcers might be held to a higher standard
than the wider public, and one might assume that if any issues arise, judgement would be given
‘close to home,’ so to speak, referring to adjectives that would undermine their professionalism.
Since law enforcement is a part of the justice system, it might not be surprising that law
enforcement professionals’ competency, reliability, honesty and justness at enforcing the law
would be questioned.
As was observed in section 2.1.2., questions asked in surveys garnering public opinion
of law enforcement often use the words trust and confidence (Liqun 2015). Trust and
confidence deal with police legitimacy as they refer to seeing the police as a legitimate actor
in charge of police security. Similarly, one could argue that competency, reliability, honesty
and justness could be seen as equally important terms to deduce legitimacy. The podcast hosts’
discussion clearly shows that law enforcement is seen, by the hosts at least, as flawed in very
important aspects. The pattern of negative judgement found in the analysis shows that the hosts
are questioning the trustworthiness of law enforcement by showcasing the flaws in the
profession in relation to the cases they cover in their podcast. Discussing law enforcement’s
behavior in regard to their tenacity, veracity and propriety can be seen as the podcast hosts’
way of bringing forth the issues in the system of dishonest and immoral police.
In total, 29 occurrences out of the total 63 included prosodic features marked as having
an effect on the perceived judgement. These can also be seen as evoked/implicit judgement, as
their meaning cannot be deduced merely from the sentences. As Wichmann (2005: 229) states,
a speaker’s emotions can be revealed in their speech and, furthermore, any interpersonal
feelings can have an influence on how the utterance is perceived by an audience. The context
within which the utterance is produced affects the meaning of the utterance as much as what is
62

Ellen Seppälä
actually said. Therefore, prosodic features like tone of voice and stress play a part in
interpreting the podcast hosts’ evaluations of law enforcement. The hosts stress various words
in their sentences and raise or lower their tone of voice in order to emphasize certain topics or
words.
Weinstein et al. (2018: 899) state that there are three main attributes to prosody: “pitch
(i.e., as how low or high a voice is perceived), amplitude (i.e., how loud a sound is perceived),
and speech rate (i.e., how fast an utterance is produced).” These have all contributed to the
perception of tone of voice in the podcast. Most occurrences feature a rise or decline in pitch
that was found to influence the meaning of the sentence. In these cases the context played a
part in the interpretation alongside the prosody. For example, take the sentence “[…] they go
back to Mark Abbott, who’s clearly like the most reliable witness” (Flowers 2018a). Without
the rise in pitch before most reliable and decline after, before witness, the sentence could be
construed to be a positive judgement of law enforcement. Within the context of law
enforcement and crime, it could have been deduced that they had chosen a reliable witness.
However, the rise in pitch signaled that this was a negative judgement. The judgement was
further strengthened by the stressing and amplitude of the word clearly and because of the
context surrounding the witness discussed earlier in the episode.
As can be seen from the results of the analysis and example given above, the podcast
hosts prefer to stress one or two words in their discussion of a case. It can be said that the
stressed words are chosen to signify for the listener that what came before culminated in the
dramatic end that is the stressed word. That is, it is meant to make the listener stop and realize
what was said earlier that makes the stressed word dramatic in its context. For example, the
sentence “[t]he deputy basically tells him, even if we found her, we wouldn’t tell you or her
mother where she is” (Flowers 2018b). The stressed words you and mother also stress for the
listener that law enforcement is treating a missing person’s relatives and close ones rudely. By
stressing the words, especially mother, listeners understand that the podcast hosts judge this
decision since important information could be withheld from ‘you’ and ‘mother’ of the missing
person, which to the hosts seems questionable and hence the listener is made aware of it.
6.3. Podcast hosts’ influence on its audience
The example above brings us to another topic that was discussed earlier in this study, namely
the influence media has on the public. The research question raised in relation to this was: to
what extent is law enforcement discussed in a way that might have an influence on the audience
of the podcast? Section 2.2 presented research on media’s influence on the public, both
63

Ellen Seppälä
discussing perception of crime and law enforcement as influenced by media as well as true
crime podcasts’ impact on public opinion.
One could say that the podcast hosts discuss law enforcement in ambiguous ways. As
in explicit judgement, the attitudinal meaning of the podcast hosts’ discussion could be deduced
by simply reading their original transcripts, as they do not always hide their feelings when they
are presenting a case. However, there are also occurrences where the judgement cannot be
realized by lexical items alone, in which case prosody in the original recordings is vital to the
understanding of the discussion. As the results have shown, there was only slightly more
negative judgement found in the podcast hosts’ discussion of law enforcement. Consequently,
and slightly contradicting my hypothesis, the difference in evaluations of negative and positive
judgement is not substantial in the podcast episodes. How come this insignificant difference?
I assumed that there would be more negative judgement because I had listened to Crime Junkie
prior to researching this podcast. I had at that point noticed the podcast’s portrayal of law
enforcement, hence the interest in exploring this issue. Despite the results showing marginally
more negative judgement, I noticed as a podcast listener the apparent negativity before
beginning this study. Therefore, I believe that this has also been noticed by others.
Additionally, since the podcast focuses mainly on American crime, I wondered how the Finnish
law enforcement would be dealt with in a similar podcast – would I detect less or more
negativity as a listener than when listening to an American true crime podcast? Is the impact
on the audience a question of cultural differences affecting our perceptions of the podcast or
what?
This being said, as studies have shown (see Potter & Kappeler 2006; Mason 2003;
Gerbner & Gross 1976), media coverage of crime is believed to affect public perception,
meaning that the way the podcasts hosts discuss crime and law enforcement can affect the
audience. Furthermore, as Kort-Butler & Sittner Hartshorn’s study (2011:48) suggests, nonfictional programs have been shown to have a negative effect on audiences especially in
relation to public opinion and prior understanding of the justice system. Crime Junkie markets
itself as a true crime podcast, which defines it as non-fictional, since it deals with real crime
stories. Effectively, one could deduce that there is a risk of the podcast’s audience being
influenced in a negative way by the discussion of law enforcement, and in a greater scope, the
justice system. The use of keywords such as incompetent, unreliable, dishonest and unjust in
relation to law enforcement raises thoughts of legitimacy and capability of maintaining public
security and safety. As Simpson (2017) noted, true crime raises awareness of the justice system
and its wrongdoings, bringing the wrongful conviction fight to the forefront of discussion,
64

Ellen Seppälä
affecting the emotions of the audience in a judgmental way. Of the podcast episodes, or cases,
featured in this study, one contained a wrongful conviction and another a speculated conviction
(see Table 1). Furthermore, in a couple of the episodes, the podcast hosts discussed who in
their mind was the culprit despite no arrest being made, which in itself could be seen as a
passive judgement about the criminal investigation, which they might see as having failed to
adequately consider the eligible suspect.
However, it is not merely the audience that can be influenced by the podcast, but vice
versa the podcast hosts by their perceived audience. As Yardley et al. (2018: 11) observed,
audiences grow tired of media’s coverage of crime and begin engaging in online communities
as citizen detectives. One could then posit that true crime podcast hosts are doing the same and
bringing the investigation away from the online forums and chat-groups to the popular medium
of podcasting. Listeners can indulge their interests while driving, cooking, doing laundry,
working out, and other mundane tasks. Gone are the days when one had to lurk on websites
like Murderpedia.org for information. Also, true crime podcast hosts have become well-known
and some earn enough money with their podcasts to quit their normal jobs and pursue
podcasting fulltime (see podcast RedHanded, for example (“Redhanded” 2020)). This
realization also brings Seltzer’s (2007: 16) argument of podcasts being more entertainment
than reality to the forefront, as podcast hosts being identified as celebrities indicates that there
might be a fine line between what is true and what is speculation, as if reality is not always
“juicy” enough.
All of this being said and as indicated by research presented here or in section 2.2, there
is further need of researching the impact of podcasts and if and to what extent they influence
their audiences which will be further developed in the next section.
6.4. Limitations and future research
As with all studies, there are certain limitations to my study. One limitation which was already
touched upon is the size of the material. For the scope of this study, the selection of episodes
had to be relatively small in number. However, despite only including seven episodes from the
podcast, the material consisted of about 45,000 words in total, which was considered a
sufficient amount for the present study. As the material consisted of a limited number of
podcast episodes, no generalizations could be made for the whole podcast material. In total,
the podcast featured 75 episodes at the beginning of the study. In order to generalize about any
of the results found in this present study, future research would have to include all or a more
substantial number of episodes from the podcast.
65

Ellen Seppälä
Using corpus linguistic methods to find occurrences of terms of law enforcement helped
this research immensely, and this method in addition to appraisal theory allowed for a more
extensive analysis than the podcast material seemed to permit. However, there are also some
issues arising from the methodology of appraisal theory and corpus linguistics which need to
be considered. According to Martin & White (2005: 69) “work on paralanguage (gesture, facial
expression, laughter, voice quality, loudness, etc.) and attendant modalities of communication
(image, music, movement, etc.) are central arenas for further research on the realization of
attitude.” In the scope of the present study, focus on paralanguage and modalities was not
possible as the podcasts were transcribed and treated as texts. The decision to focus on prosody,
namely tone of voice and stress in the audio recordings of the podcasts, was done in the
appraisal analysis to include information that was apparent in the audio recordings but not as
clearly evident in the transcripts alone. Future research could focus in more detail on all aspects
that contribute to the attitudinal meaning of podcasts in general.
Despite the original material being audio recordings, the transcripts have been the main
focus in this study, because a corpus analysis of the material was needed to find analytical
keywords using corpus linguistic methods. In the appraisal analysis that followed, it was
decided to keep the focus on the transcript while taking prosody into consideration when
necessary. While a qualitative analysis gives depth to the study, it can be problematic as it is
largely based on the researcher’s individual interpretation of the material, which can always be
argued to be subjective. For example, identifying evaluations of judgement in the audio
recordings, whether positive or negative, could give different results depending on the
researcher. I have aimed at objectivity when possible and the analyses were restricted to a
certain material and its background as presented in the podcasts of this study. In addition to
this, despite being observant, there is always a risk for human error and discrepancies in the
results. To account for this, the analyses have been double-checked. Transcribing and doublechecking the analyses has been my way of ensuring objectivity in this study.
Podcasting being a fairly new and scarcely researched medium means that there is still
a lot of study to be done on the medium as research material. Furthermore, as this study has
shown, it is possible to do a linguistic analysis using podcasts as research material. Podcasts
should be studied linguistically in more detail in the future, as podcasting is a medium used by
different kinds of people around the world and for various purposes. It therefore presents an
interesting material for research in its diversity as well as in its impact on the audience. As
noted in the introduction, podcasts exist for various types of reasons from education to
entertainment. Since podcasts are not geographically constricted in the same sense as
66

Ellen Seppälä
conventional media, they can be downloaded around the world and are hence accessible by
people from different cultures and backgrounds. In this sense, the major point for future
research would be to explicitly study podcasts’ influence on its audiences, as has been a main
interest also in this study. In recent years podcasting has become a mainstream medium and is
growing in popularity also in higher education as an aid for learning and teaching (Salmon
2008). The rise of using technology in the classroom can be seen as predicting that podcasting
can become a generally used tool also in other channels. Businesses have started creating their
own podcasts as a means of marketing their services as so-called branded podcasts. Examples
include podcasts started by Slack, Microsoft and McDonald’s (Backtracks 2019). The more
podcasting rises in popularity across multiple spectrums, the more important it becomes to start
academic researching on the medium as well. Furthermore, and in line with the present study,
true crime podcasts bring a new approach to crime reporting but their impact – both positive
and/or negative – can have unexpected effects on criminal investigations and the justice system
as a whole, which should not be taken lightly. As civil rights activist Malcolm X famously
stated in 1963 in the US:
The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to
make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s
power. Because they control the minds of the masses.
Whether this is the case also for podcasting remains to be seen by further research.

7. Conclusion
The aim of this study has been to analyze episodes from the American true crime podcast Crime
Junkie using corpus linguistics and appraisal theory to determine what vocabulary for law
enforcement the podcasts hosts use and how they evaluate law enforcement in relation to
judgement in their discussion. The findings were then related to previous research on media’s
influence on the public in order to be able to discuss the tricky question of how podcast hosts
might affect the audience’s views on law enforcement and judgement, and vice versa how
perceived popular opinions might steer podcast hosts’ opinions. Furthermore, the study was
used as an exploration if podcasts could be analyzed from a linguistic perspective.

67

Ellen Seppälä
The corpus analysis found that there were 12 different lexical items used by the podcast
hosts to refer to law enforcement in the seven episodes that were analyzed. The most common
term was police across most of the episodes, as police is a generic term for law enforcement
and independent of the US’s different branches of law enforcement across cities, counties,
states and the federation. It was therefore suggested in this thesis that further studies should be
conducted on the particular choices of vocabulary used in podcasts for different kinds of
themes, as this study did for law enforcement.
The vocabulary found in the corpus analysis was further utilized when analyzing the
discussion of law enforcement for evaluations of judgement by the podcast hosts. The analysis
was conducted on the episode transcripts but prosody was also taken into account as the
transcribed material was originally audio recordings. It was hypothesized that the evaluations
would be more negative than positive, and this was found to be true in the findings, although
the podcast hosts judged law enforcement only slightly more negatively than positively across
the episodes. There was however variation between all episodes, and some had only positive
or negative evaluation which indicates that there can be no uncontested and generalizable
results. Further research should therefore be conducted on all the episodes of Crime Junkie in
order to draw firmer conclusions.
As has been observed in earlier research and noted throughout this thesis, media can be
seen to influence the public, and despite podcasting being a new medium, it should also be seen
as bearing an influence on its audiences. However, the scope of this study does not permit
closer research on audience influence. Nevertheless, due to the discussion in this thesis it
represents an important area for future research into the new medium of podcasting. Podcasting
became a mainstream medium as late as 2014 with the true crime podcast Serial, but not much
research has been conducted on the influence this particular medium has on its audience. This
is so, despite earlier research into many other kinds of media impacts on the audience that
concludes in general a clear correlation between media and public opinion, as was presented
in beginning of this thesis.
I acknowledge that this study is exploratory under specific limitations to both the
methodology and the generalization of the findings. In order to narrow the scope of the study
to the present one, it was decided to not analyze the podcast’s audience and any influence the
evaluation of judgement the appraisal analysis might construe. Furthermore, this study has
shown that analyzing podcasts from a linguistic perspective is not only possible. In fact, it
would serve as a way of looking at vocabulary used in different circumstances, by different
people and various audiences around the world. This study has shown that podcasts are not
68

Ellen Seppälä
only interesting research material, but a relevant addition to media research even though the
number of studies conducted on the medium at present is limited.
A main question raised by this study is if the medium can influence its audience and in
what ways. Since podcasting is seen as the new mainstream medium, there is a need for further
research on podcast influence on public opinion, especially when it comes to podcasts dealing
with societally important issues like crime and crime prevention, or politics. Notably, despite
what media seem to stress, there has not been a rise in crime in recent years in the US but rather
the contrary, crime rates are falling and are historically low. There is therefore a need for people
to be vigilant when it comes to what media report. In the present world, an abundance of ‘fake
news’ is a constant threat that can radically shape public opinion. One might believe that one
could spot the news that is not true from what is; however this might not always be the case.
As Boda & Szabó (2011: 337) found, the public firmly believes that media influence the public,
although the wider public tend to perceive themselves as exempt from such influence. Do not
believe to be immune to the media as they are all around you; like the flu you will most likely
catch its influence without knowing how and from where you were infected. Most worryingly,
you can be influenced before you even know that you have been.

Swedish Summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Good Cop, Bad Cop?
En analys över bedömningar om det amerikanska polisväsendet i programledarnas
diskussioner i verkliga brottspodden Crime Junkie
Inledning och syfte
Under det tjugoförsta århundradet introducerades ett nytt massmedium som enkelt och lätt når
människor runtom i världen. Detta medium är den så kallade podcasten, även kallat
poddutsändning eller bara podd. Podcaster är ljudfiler som kan höras på internet eller laddas
ner till en dator, mobil eller surfplatta och fördelen med podcaster i förhållande till andra
massmedium är att man i princip kan lyssna på dem var man vill. Man behöver inte vänta till
ett visst klockslag eller befinna sig på en viss plats för att höra en podcast, så länge det finns
en nätförbindelse eller ifall poddavsnittet har laddats ner och kan höras utan nätförbindelse.
Podcasternas lättillgänglighet framom till exempel radiosändningar har bidragit till deras
växande popularitet.
Podcaster anses ha uppkommit runt år 2004, men det var först tio år senare som poddar
blev ett populärt medium för spridning av information, åsikter och tankar till lyssnarna genom
podcasten Serial som lanserades 2014. Det påstås att podden Serial var en slags katalysator för
ett uppdämt behov av podcaster då den rekordsnabbt uppnådde fem miljoner nedladdningar
(Yardley et al. 2018: 2). Närmare sex år senare, i februari 2020, fanns det uppskattningsvis
850 000 poddar runtom i världen (Winn 2020), men det finns ännu mycket litet forskning om
podcasters påverkan på sin publik.
Det finns en mångfald av podcaster och de skiljer sig från varandra bland annat genom
mängden programledare och ämnet som diskuteras i podden. Ett populärt ämne för podcaster
sedan begynnelsen är verkliga brott (eng. true crime), som behandlar olika slags brott eller
vissa specifika typer av brott som skett i verkligheten. Verkliga brott är en icke-fiktiv genre
inom litteratur, film, radio och tv där producenten eller författaren utreder och diskuterar ett
begånget brott med fokus på omständigheterna och handlingarna runt brottet eller kring offren
och gärningsmännen. Genren är inte ny, utan den har sina rötter i antikens Rom och Grekland,
där begångna brott användes i dramatik för att uppfostra folk till laglydighet. Många dåtida
tragedier hämtade sitt tema ur äktenskapsbrott och mord (Tetlow 2005). Populariteten med

70

Ellen Seppälä
genren visar att folket är intresserade av de brott som begås och vem som begår dem.
Människan verkar fascineras av det makabra av olika skäl.
Syftet med denna avhandling är att analysera hur företrädare för lag och ordning (eng.
law enforcement), framöver enbart polisväsendet eller polisen, presenteras och bedöms av de
två programledarna i sju avsnitt av den amerikanska verkliga brottspodden Crime Junkie. Två
analyser har utförts, varav den ena analysen fokuserar på programledarnas vokabulär, medan
den andra granskar deras bedömningar av det amerikanska polisväsendet. Utifrån analyserna
diskuterar studien massmedias inflytande på allmänheten med fokus på hur podcaster influerar
sina lyssnare. Målet med avhandlingen är således mångfacetterat. Avhandlingen syftar till att
redogöra för de olika termerna som används av programledarna om det amerikanska
polisväsendet, men också hur de bedömer och värderar polisens beteende i förhållande till de
brott som beskrivs i poddavsnitten. Hypotesen är att bedömningen av polisväsendet generellt
sett är mera negativ än positiv. Som en biprodukt visar avhandlingen att podcaster kan
undersökas också ur ett lingvistiskt perspektiv.
Bakgrund
Förenta staterna är en parlamentarisk demokrati med lagstiftande, verkställande och dömande
organ där polisväsendet faller under den dömande makten med uppgift att upprätthålla lag och
ordning. Inom det amerikanska polisväsendet finns det tre separata polismyndigheter med olika
jurisdiktioner: federala, statliga, och kommunala polismyndigheter (Horne 2004: 435). En
annan faktor som skiljer dessa myndigheter åt är deras olika geografiska verksamhetsområden.
De federala polismyndigheterna har ansvar för landsomfattande brottsbekämpning och arbetar
direkt under både det amerikanska justitiedepartementet och inrikessäkerhetsdepartementet.
De statliga polismyndigheterna har befogenheter som gäller en hel delstat, men uppgifterna
överlappar ibland de kommunala polismyndigheternas verksamhetsområde. Till de
kommunala polismyndigheterna räknas stadspolisen och sheriffmyndigheten på landsorterna.
Forskningen om det amerikanska folkets förtroende för polisväsendet visar i allmänhet
ett förhållandevis högt förtroende för polisen oberoende av polismyndighet (Saad 2018;
Norman 2017), men det finns vissa skillnader beroende på individens etnicitet,
socioekonomiska ställning, ålder och utbildningsnivå. Forskare är ändå inte eniga om hur dessa
faktorer påverkar förtroendet i praktiken. Överlag påstås kaukasier i USA ha större förtroende
för polisen än olika etniska minoriteter. Dessutom beror skillnader i tilliten till polisen på
individernas tidigare erfarenheter av sina kontakter med polisen i de områden där de bor
(Walter & Katz 2008). Till exempel så har äldre personer ett större förtroende för polisväsendet
71

Ellen Seppälä
än yngre. Högre utbildade har en större tillit till polisen än lägre utbildade (Walter & Katz
2008; Brown & Benedict 2002). Tidigare forskning visar också att de som fallit offer för brott
i USA har mindre förtroende för polisväsendet än andra, vilket kan tyda på att brottsoffer inte
upplever att polisen gör ett tillräckligt bra arbete i att gripa gärningsmän (Sampson & Bartusch
1998).
Enligt Boda och Szabó (2011: 337) är informanter av den åsikten att media påverkar stort
det amerikanska folket, något som är allmänt accepterat inom vetenskapen om folkopinioner.
Enligt statistiken har brottsligheten i USA årligen minskat de senaste 14 åren, men forskningen
om folkopinion och brottslighet visar att folk tror det motsatta (Gallup 2019; Friedman et al.
2017). Medias rapportering om brott har en tendens att skapa allmän oro över kriminaliteten,
något som Cohen (1972) kallar för moralpanik. Det påstås att frekventa beskrivningar av brott
i media ökar folks rädsla för att bli utsatta för brott. Dessutom sägs det att även skönlitterära
brottshistorier påverkar allmänheten på samma sätt. Ett exempel på detta är hur rättsutövningen
i USA har påverkats av den populära amerikanska TV-serien CSI, som handlar om hur
kriminaltekniker bidrar till brottsutredningen. Serien har kritiserats för att ge allmänheten en
alltför orealistisk bild av hur poliser löser brott. Serien lade så stor vikt vid fysiska bevis att
jurymedlemmar nu förväntar sig starka fysiska bevis i olika rättsfall och vägrar döma enbart
på indicier. Fenomenet kallas CSI-effekten (Hayes and Levett 2012; Watkins 2004).
Det är relevant för denna undersökning att också beakta hur verklighetsbaserade
brottsprogram på TV påverkar allmänhetens förtroende för polisväsendet, eftersom podcaster
brukar uppfattas som en variant av modern massmedia. Dessvärre fattas en enhetlig
vetenskaplig åsikt om i vilken grad massmedia kan tänkas påverka allmänheten. Vissa studier
visar att verklighetsbaserade brottsprogram på TV har en negativ inverkan på förtroendet för
polisen, medan andra studier inte har hittat något samband mellan media och tilliten till polisen
(Kort-Butler & Sittner Hartshorn 2011; Eschholz et al. 2002). I och med den växande
populariteten för verkliga brottspoddar får folk veta om olösta fall och justitiemord som aldrig
förr, vilket kan sänka förtroendet för polisen i allmänhet. Yardley et al. (2018) hävdar att
poddarna ofta kritiserar hur olika brottsmål hanteras i media, vid domstolen och av polisen.
Därför kan man anta att lyssnarna påverkas negativt av programledarnas sätt att diskutera olika
brott i podcasten. Dessutom hävdar Yardley et al. (2018) att publiken ofta tröttnar på tråkiga
brottsbeskrivningar i traditionell media. De engagerar sig hellre i onlinemiljöer som så kallade
medborgardetektiver. I Boling och Hulls (2018) studie rapporteras 63 procent av informanterna
vara aktiva medlemmar i åtminstone en podcasts onlinemiljö.
72

Metod och material
Materialet för denna studie valdes slumpmässigt utifrån Crime Junkie-poddens olika avsnitt. I
slutet av mars 2019 hade 75 avsnitt sänts. Av dessa granskas sju i denna undersökning. De
valda avsnitten berör mord och olika försvinnanden i USA som tyder på att ett brott kan ha
skett. Avsnitten är i medeltal 40 minuter långa. Mer detaljerad information om de enskilda
fallen presenteras närmare i tabell 1 i kapitel 4.1. Avsnitten analyserades på två sätt. En
lingvistisk analys gjordes med hjälp av korpuslingvistik då frekvensen av de termer
programledarna använde om polisväsendet i sin diskussion granskades. För att kunna utföra
den lingvistiska frekvensanalysen transkriberades ljudfilerna av de olika poddavsnitten till en
korpus på 46 000 ord. De tolv termer för polisväsendet som studerades i korpusen presenteras
i tabell 2 i kapitel 4.3.
Den andra analysen tillämpade en metod som grundar sig på appraisalteorin.
Appraisalteorin är en teoretisk infallsvinkel inom systemisk-funktionell lingvistik med vilket
man försöker hantera analyser av evaluering och värdering (Martin & White 2005).
Appraisalteorin gör det möjligt att analysera de dolda attityder och känslor som en skribent
framför i sin text, men likväl hur läsare förhåller sig till texten.
Appraisalmodellen indelas i tre huvudgrupper: attityd, engagemang och gradering.
Dessa indelas i sin tur i underkategorier av vilka jag för denna studie har valt att fokusera på
underkategorin bedömning (eng. judgement) under huvudgruppen attityd. Bedömande
yttranden definieras som skribentens, eller i detta fall programledarnas, uttalade värderingar av
mänskliga beteenden ur normativa principer eller uppfattningar om rätt och fel eller bra och
dåligt. Bedömningar kan uttryckas i antingen positiva eller negativa ordalag. I appraisalteorin
indelas bedömning ytterligare i yttranden gällande social karaktär (eng. social esteem) eller
socialt godkännande (eng. social sanction). Social karaktär omfattar normalitet, kapacitet och
beslutsamhet, alltså bedömningar av någons beteende som normalt/onormalt, kunnigt/okunnigt
och beslutsamt/obeslutsamt. Socialt godkännande omfattar trovärdighet och anständighet, det
vill säga om någons beteende uppfattas som pålitligt eller opålitligt och anständigt eller
oanständigt. Enligt Martin och White (2005: 52) uttrycks bedömning inom social karaktär
främst i muntliga sammanhang, till exempel genom skvaller och berättande. Socialt
godkännande definieras i appraisalteorin som skrivna lagar och regler, det vill säga beteenden
som allmänt betraktas som acceptabla. Dessutom kan bedömande yttranden uttryckas implicit
eller explicit. Det innebär att det är viktigt för denna studie att analysera yttrandena i sin helhet
och kontext.
73

Ellen Seppälä
Appraisalanalysen utfördes i denna studie genom att läsa igenom och analysera alla
meningar och paragrafer där programledarna i podcasten diskuterade polisväsendet. Ifall
yttrandet kunde uppfattas som en bedömning, kodades den enligt de ovannämnda
undergrupperna för social karaktär och socialt godkännande, det vill säga normalitet, kapacitet,
beslutsamhet, trovärdighet eller anständighet, och enligt vare sig bedömningen uppfattades
som positiv eller negativ. Som hjälp i analysen användes ordlistorna i tabell 3 och 4 i kapitel
4.4.2. Eftersom det ursprungliga undersökningsmaterialet består av ljudfiler som har
transkriberats till texter, har även prosodiska egenskaper såsom satsaccent och tonfall beaktats
i analysen av bedömande yttranden.
Resultat
Resultaten från den korpuslingvistiska analysen visar att programledarna i podcastens sju
studerade avsnitt nämner det amerikanska polisväsendet hela 307 gånger. Mest användes
termen police i 163 uttalanden, men variationen av termer är stor mellan avsnitten. I alla avsnitt
används de facto flera olika termer för det amerikanska polisväsendet som reflekterar det att
det finns tre separata polismyndigheter i USA. Ordet sheriff är den mest använda termen i bara
ett avsnitt. Termerna och deras frekvenser behandlas närmare i tabell 4 i kapitel 5.1. Det
förekommer också en viss variation mellan de olika avsnitten, speciellt gällande frekvensen av
olika termer för polisväsendet. De facto står två avsnitt för 50 procent av alla uttalanden för
polisväsendet i undersökningsmaterialet. Dessa två avsnitt var också de längsta avsnitten i
undersökningsmaterialet.
Det förekommer 63 bedömande yttranden om polisväsendet i programledarnas
diskussion. Av dem är 36 negativa och 27 positiva. De flesta yttranden tillhör undergruppen
kapacitet, som inkluderar 28 yttranden. Dylika yttranden handlar om polisens förmåga att
hantera brottet, till exempel, om polisen har agerat kunnigt eller okunnigt och allting där
emellan. Det förekommer inga bedömande yttranden om undergruppen normalitet, det vill säga
programledarna diskuterar inte om polisen beter sig normalt eller onormalt. Olika yttranden
har definierats i förhållandet till polisens trovärdighet och anständighet, alltså hur polisens
beteende anses vara trovärdigt eller icke-trovärdigt och moraliskt eller omoraliskt. Resultaten
pekar mot mera negativa än positiva yttranden kring polisens trovärdighet och anständighet,
medan yttranden som tyder på polisens kapacitet och beslutsamhet är mera jämnt fördelade
som positiva eller negativa. Detta antyder att programledarna anser att polisen är kunnig men
ändå inte trovärdig.
74

Ellen Seppälä
Frekvensen av bedömningar om polisväsendet i de sju avsnitten varierar stort. En annan
iakttagelse är att några avsnitt är klart mer negativa än andra. I likhet med den
korpuslingvistiska analysen, förekommer de flesta bedömande yttranden i de två längsta
poddavsnitten. Båda innehåller även mer negativ än positiv bedömning. Däremot innehåller ett
avsnitt i undersökningsmaterialet bara positiva bedömningar om polisväsendet. Noteras bör att
alla undergrupper som beskriver bedömande yttranden inte förekommer i alla avsnitt. I
appendix B finns hela appraisalanalysens resultat fördelat enligt undergrupperna för
bedömande yttranden av social karaktär eller socialt godkännande, de centrala nyckelorden och
olika prosodiska egenskaper som har påverkat tolkningen och kategoriseringen av yttrandena.
Diskussion
Undersökningens resultat visar att programledarna använder många olika termer för det
amerikanska polisväsendet och att det finns variation mellan olika termer beroende på i vilka
sammanhang de används. Police var den mest använda termen i majoriteten av avsnitten. Detta
var väntat, eftersom termen polis är ett allmänt ord för att beskriva polisväsendet i gemen i
engelskan och i många andra språk. Resultatet innebär att framtida studier borde forska
närmare i de sammanhang som de olika termerna används i podcaster och i programledarnas
vokabulär. Figur 5 visar att 50 procent av alla termer om polisväsendet förekommer i de längsta
poddavsnitten. Detta visar självfallet att ju längre ett poddavsnitt är, desto mer diskuteras
polisen av programledarna.
Resultaten av appraisalanalysen bekräftar att hypotesen om att programledarnas
diskussion innehåller fler negativa än positiva bedömningar stämmer. De flesta bedömande
yttrandena gällde polisens kapacitet. Polisens kapacitet diskuterades mer positivt än negativt,
vilket är intressant eftersom det antyder att programledarna anser att polisen är kapabel att
utföra sitt arbete. Däremot diskuterades polisens beslutsamhet, trovärdighet och anständighet i
mera negativ än positiv bemärkelse. Det innebär att programledarna varken anser att polisen är
pålitlig eller anständig i sitt beteende. Detta strider mot att det är väldigt viktigt för polisen att
ha allmänhetens förtroende i sitt arbete för samhällets bästa. Följaktligen anser Schermann
(2019) att ett av de viktigaste karaktärsdragen för poliser är empati och medlidande för
allmänheten. Det är oroväckande att programledarna verkar se så negativt på polisens
rättskänsla. Det förklarar varför de mest förekommande nyckelorden för bedömande yttranden
i poddavsnitten var kompetent, inkompetent, opålitlig, oärlig och orättvis.
Undersökningsmaterialet är inte tillräckligt stort för att dra generaliserande slutsatser
om Crime Junkie-podcasten i allmänhet. För att se om användningen av olika termer och
75

Ellen Seppälä
negativiteten i programledarnas bedömningar gäller, måste fler avsnitt ur podcasten analyseras.
Ur figur 7 framgår att frekvensen bedömande yttranden om polisväsendet trots allt är marginellt
i förhållande till frekvensen av termer som programledarna använde då de diskuterade polisen.
Detta är viktigt eftersom det innebär att även om polisväsendet diskuteras mycket i
poddavsnitten så består de inte enbart av bedömningar av polisens beteende.
Ett syfte med denna avhandling har också varit att diskutera huruvida podcaster kan
anses ha samma inverkan på sin publik som vanlig massmedia. Eftersom jag själv har lyssnat
på podcasten Crime Junkie, lade jag tidigt märke till den negativa tonen i poddens avsnitt och
utgick därför ifrån att den studerade podden dominerades av negativ bedömning av polisen.
Användningen av nyckelord som inkompetent, orättvis, oärlig och opålitlig är oroväckande
beskrivningar av polisväsendet och kan påverka allmänhetens uppfattningar negativt. Som
Kort-Butler och Sittner Harthorn (2014) påpekar brukar verklighetsbaserade program rent
allmänt ha en negativ effekt på allmänheten och folkopinionen. Crime Junkie är en slags
verklighetsbaserad podcast och kan därför ha samma negativa effekt på sina lyssnare. Eftersom
podcaster är ett relativt nytt massmedium finns det få studier om programledares inflytande på
sina lyssnare. Följaktligen borde det forskas mycket mera i podcaster i framtiden.
En begränsning för denna studie är undersökningsmaterialets småskalighet. Framtida
studier borde analysera samtliga avsnitt eller en klar majoritet av avsnitten i podcasten Crime
Junkie för att slutsatserna skulle bli mera allmängiltiga. Denna avhandling visar att podcaster
de facto kan analyseras ur ett lingvistiskt perspektiv. Framtida studier inom lingvistik borde
använda podcaster som undersökningsmaterial och kunde då fokusera på programledares
ordval och talesätt. Eftersom podcaster är ljudfiler borde framtida studier ta uttalandens
prosodiska egenskaper och paralingvistisk fonetik i beaktande.
Slutsats
Denna avhandling undersökte hur programledarna i podcasten Crime Junkie diskuterade det
amerikanska polisväsendet och hur de bedömde polisens beteende i de sju studerande
poddavsnitten. Hypotesen för avhandlingen var att poddavsnitten innehåller fler negativa
bedömande yttranden än positiva, vilket bekräftades av resultaten. Teorierna som tillämpades
i avhandlingen var korpuslingvistik och appraisalteori i de två analyser som gjordes. Den första
fokuserade på termer och deras frekvens som programledarna använde då de diskuterade det
amerikanska polisväsendet. Med hjälp av resultaten från den korpuslingvistiska analysen
studerades programledarnas diskussion för bedömningar av polisen beteende.

Dessutom presenterade avhandlingen tidigare studier om massmedias påverkan på
allmänheten och förtroende för polisväsendet i USA. Resultaten i appraisalanalysen
diskuterades i relation till dessa studier i syfte att granska idéen om att podcaster kan anses ha
ett inflytande på sina lyssnare. Eftersom podcaster är ett relativt nytt massmedium finns det
inte tillräckligt tidigare forskning om och hur de påverkar sin publik. Poddar är varken
geografiskt eller tidsmässigt begränsade på samma sätt som till exempel radio. Man kan lyssna
på dem på nätet oberoende var man befinner sig eller vad klockan är. Det betyder att poddens
räckvidd är betydligt större än för andra medier. Eftersom fejknyheter är ett aktuellt problem
och samtalsämne i världen, är det viktigt för var och en av oss att inse massmediernas roll för
oss som lyssnare och läsare. Podcaster kan inte uteslutas ur detta. Faktum är att massmedia
finns överallt och vi påverkas utan att ens veta om det.

Appendix A: Transcript of Crime Junkie podcast episode “1: Missing: Niqui McCown”
Flowers, Ashley. December 18, 2017. “Missing: Niqui McCown” [Transcript]. Available:
Spotify.com [27 April, 2019]
Ashley:
This week I thought nothing was more appropriate than to actually talk about a local
case. So I’m gonna give you guys a story of a missing woman here in Indiana. Niqui
McCown is a 28-year-old female who lives in Richmond, Indiana. And for everyone
not listening from Indiana, Richmond is about an hour east of Indianapolis and about
fifty minutes west of Dayton, Ohio. Niqui was actually engaged at the time she went
missing to Bobby Webster. He was her fiancé, they were uh said to be married on
August 18th and they actually had a history. Bobby and Niqui dated in high school and
they only broke up because in 1991 he moved to California and they just kind of have
this natural separation and, and started living different lives and Niqui would, you
know, dated other people, she actually had a child with someone else, and in 1998 is
when Bobby move back, they realize that they did love each other, wanted to spend
their lives together and they got engaged. So the story really starts on July 22 of 2001,
just a couple of weeks before they were scheduled to get married and by all accounts
this is a super average day, it is a Sunday and they are just running around doing errands,
they are doing some chores so, Bobby takes his cousin to the mall to get his tux fitted
and Niqui borrows his, uh, Bobby’s car, his car, to go to the laundromat so that she can
do some laundry.
And she drops of her daughter at her parents’ house heads to the laundry mat and a few
hours later she drops back by her parents’ house while her clothes are in the dryer and
she comes over to her mom’s house because she said “I just felt super uncomfortable
at the laundry mat, these guys are just giving me a hard time they were harassing me
and like I just needed to get out of there” and her mom said will you know you can feel
free to like come do your laundry at my house, you don’t need to put up with that, and
she said “you know don’t even worry about at this point like my clothes are drying I’m
almost done I’m just gonna wait it out here when I think the clothes are done I’m gonna
go pick them up and then I’m gonna leave.”
So she leaves her mother’s house, eh, to go pick up her clothes and a few more hours
pass by and she doesn’t come back to pick up her daughter Payton and Bobby actually
returned home from the mall with his cousin. And there’s no Nicki, there’s no laundry,
but her purse and her ID are still at the house so he thinks okay she’s probably still just
at the laundromat took a little bit longer maybe she’s running an errand, and he waits
and he waits and he waits.
Brit:

Oh no.
87

Ellen Seppälä

Ashley:
And finally around like six or seven at night, he starts calling around and asking people,
okay is she with you and he starts learning that nobody’s seen her for a while and she
hasn’t picked up her daughter and so by ten PM, he’s done calling people he’s like I’m
getting in the car and I’m gonna go look for her so he kind of drives around town, drives
by the laundromat and then he actually makes the drive to Dayton, Ohio because. Nicki
actually works in Dayton stil, she was at work at a correctional facility and she started
there a long time ago as a CO, correctional officer, and now she’s their head of
accounting, so he’s like you know maybe something came up at work that like I don’t
know about where she had to pick something up
Brit:

Right.

Ashley:
I’m gonna drive, I’m gonna drive the whole way, maybe she got an accident and I need
to keep an eye out for her. So he goes all the way there and there’s just no sign of Niqui
anywhere. Her family fills out a missing person report that next morning because
everyone is concerned for her at this point. And they decide on their own after they fill
out this missing person report, they’re going to go to the last place they knew she was
and start asking around. And next to the laundry mat where she was doing her laundry
is a village pantry, which I’m pretty sure is like a convenience store, right?
Brit:

I’d said I think it’s like a maybe like a grocery store or maybe a kindle? like a Kroger?
[6:32]

Ashley:
Okay. So she goes to the village pantry and they actually let the family see the security
footage from there. And it’s totally normal, like she does not look stressed, she looks
fine, she walks in
[Brit: Just shopping around]
Ashley:
Right, she walks in, she buys a coke, leaves, you can see her car in the front of the store
and you can actually see her drive away, there appears to be no one that followed her,
and this video footage was actually taken before she went and stopped back at her
mother’s house, so they know that nothing happened to her after that, but they were
kind of looking to see, you know, what she with anyone, did she look upset, they were
looking for
[Brit: Was she being followed [Ashley: yeah any clues] all that stuff. [Ashley: at this point]
88

Ellen Seppälä

Ashley:
After they go to the village pantry, they decide to go back to the laundry mat because
her mother remembers her being distressed and talking about these guys that were
harassing her, so they go talk to people who would have been at the laundry mat people
that were working at the laundry mat. And the thing is nobody even remembers her, not
that she wasn’t there, but nothing of note was, happened to the point where anyone else
[Brit: nothing out of the ordinary]
Ashley:
Right, no one else took notice so, someone might have been giving her a hard time or
making her uneasy, but no one was actually like confronting her or being physical with
her, and no one made a scene to the point where anyone else would actually be aware
of it. [7:57]
Now at this point, police are just saying, you know, she probably left voluntarily, she
had the car, you know, she’s a grown woman, she doesn’t look like she’s distressed in
these videos, but her family knows there’s no way she’s leaving her daughter, there’s
no way she’s leaving with her wedding three weeks away, she was so excited to get
married, and she loves her job and so the one thing they’re waiting for is they’re like
okay, let’s wait until Niqui’s next shift and if she doesn’t show up then all hell is
breaking loose ‘cause we know something is wrong and sure enough she doesn’t show
up to work.
Police can’t find anything on her cards, like her bank cards or her phone records and at
this point I think police are even getting concerned as well they’re, they’re not brushing
the family off anymore and they actually do helicopter search between Richmond,
Indiana and Dayton, Ohio, looking for her car because everyone’s thinking that, okay
if we find a car like that is going to have all of our answers were gonna be able to find
Niqui. Police in the meantime, they don’t find the car and so, you know, there’s only
one person police look at first when
[Brit: of course.]
A, a wife or a fiancé goes missing so they look at her fiancé, Bobby. And Bobby did
not do himself any favors [laugh]. [Brit: ugh] So one day after she goes missing, Bobby
calls the community college where Nicky is taking classes, and he, according to the
lady who spoke to him, he was basically trying to collect her unused tuition.
Which, like isn’t,
Brit:

It’s not a thing.
89

Ellen Seppälä

Ashley:
It’s not a thing, like she’s been gone, like a date like you think that you’re gonna like
okay she’s not coming back for classes, like he automatically goes right there. And
[Brit: yeaaah [skeptical]] he didn’t know that her college is being paid by her employer
so it’s not even like there were funds sitting in her account like, if, if you cancel your
classes by a certain day you can get money back and I don’t know if that’s what he was
thinking but it doesn’t even matter because her, um
Brit:

It wouldn’t have gone back to him.

Ashley:
Exactly. By Wednesday, again she went missing on Sunday, he actually went to the
jeweler where Nicky bought his wedding ring and tried to return the wedding ring,
Brit:

[exclamation] no!
For money. And by midweek Bobby has totally canceled the wedding and demanded
their deposit back. [Brit: what?] We’re talking like three or four days, so when I said
this guy didn’t do himself any favors like, no exaggeration.

Brit:

That’s honestly kind of an understatement, he did like everything he could possibly DO,
to look suspicious.

Ashley:
Right, so you know cops looked at him right away but for very good reason, and if you
hear his side of the story, obviously there’s, there’s always two sides, and he denies
ever canceling the wedding, he just said that he made remarks that the wedding doesn’t
matter, that all he’s focused on is finding her and the wedding didn’t even cross his
mind. He doesn’t really reference a deposit though, so I don’t know if money was ever
given back to him, he kind of just brushes that aside. And he said that he was calling
the school not to demand money back, but to make sure she didn’t have like an
outstanding loan that she would be defaulting on now that she’s not there, which again
seems like, it seems kind of noble but the last thing I’d be thinking about if my fiancé
was gone for like what twelve hours, twenty hours. Like I’m not like I wonder like if I
need to call like his credit card or his school and that’s, you’re not thinking about that,
right?
Brit:

No, no, definitely not, it, it just doesn’t make sense.

Ashley:
Yeah, and he finally he said that he did go to sell the ring but he only sold it because at
the time they didn’t have a cell phone, and he thought he wanted to trade in the ring to
90

Ellen Seppälä
buy a cell phone because it was super important he thought to like keep the family
connected, everyone is really participating in search efforts and they’re trying to keep
connected and, and see if anyone knows Niqui, he wanted a way for people to reach out
to him if he was out searching, so that, that’s kind of on the up and up it, it seems legit
but again, who knows, I don’t know, there’s no evidence that he actually bought the
cell phone, so I don’t know what’s what it’s just stories at this point.
Brit:

Yeah, I, I could speculate a lot but I’m just going to stop. [laugh]

Ashley:
Police asked Bobby to take a polygraph and he does agree, and the question, the most
important question, is they ask him did you have something to do or did you know
where Nicky went, and his response was “no.” But the polygrapher said that that was a
huge lie. Bobby said, that, that that’s not how they asked him, he said that they said, do
you feel responsible for her going missing and he said how would any man not feel
partially responsible for not being there, when something happens to your fiancé, your
woman. So again two sides of the coin, you have detectives saying one thing, Bobby
saying another, who do you believe at this point and especially when there is no
evidence of anything to point to him other than the statements, there’s really nothing to
go off of and he’s not labeled a suspect, he’s labeled a person of interest, which I
actually learned something new, I think I know everything about true crime and, and
every once in a while I learn something I didn’t know, I know they label people person
of interest and suspect but I didn’t, I guess I didn’t really know what the actual
definition of the difference was I know person interest is like a level below a suspect.
[Brit: right]
But they say that, eh, what I learned is a person of interest doesn’t necessarily mean
they had anything to do with the crime or that, that a person of interest necessarily could
elevate to a suspect, it’s possible, but really if someone’s a person of interest it just
means that the police believe that they have significant information, that they need to
further the case. So it makes total sense, [Brit: interesting] right, it might be something
everyone knows but I thought it was a little fun
Brit:

Definitely.

Ashley:
Family members go rogue at this point because it, the case is kind of going cold and
Niqui has nine brothers and sisters, and her brothers are like pounding pavement and
literally to the point where they’re getting arrested because, I don’t, they don’t say
exactly I don’t know if they were harassing people or just getting too you know
confrontational with people, I have no idea but they’re trying to solve the case on their
own, and even they aren’t getting anywhere and really they’re just getting themselves
in trouble. And the family totally shuts Bobby out at this point, they think everything
that he’s doing is super suspicious, so he really has no interaction with the investigation
or with the search for Niqui at this point.
91

Ellen Seppälä

And the case goes pretty cold for about three and a half months until November 3 rd of
2001 when her car is finally found [Brit: gasp] in Dayton, Ohio, and the car is about
40 miles from her home and it’s found in an apartment complex, and I’ve heard rumors
that she actually used to live in that apartment complex a long time ago but I couldn’t
really substantiate, it’s just I’d see every once in a while when I was reading articles.
They find her car and in the backseat of her car, it’s like she was there minutes ago.
Brit:

Oh my god

Ashley:
There is still the laundry basket with folded laundry [Brit: gasp], and nothing else. They
tow the car back to Indiana and completely process it, looking for blood, fibers, hair,
prints, and they find absolutely nothing [Brit: nothing, oh my god!]
The one thing that this car it does do, is it gets them focusing on Ohio rather than
Indiana, they think that she was most likely abducted from the laundry mat but, they’re
thinking okay at least we know now at some point her car was in Ohio, maybe she was
as well and, she works in Ohio so she does have connections there and one of these
connections is a man named Tommy Swint and he lived about a quarter mile away from
where the car was found, and he was a coworker of Niqui’s, and I’ve heard in some
places that he wanted a relationship with her but she saw him more as a brother, and I
read that in all of the articles, in all the documentaries, up until there was a really recent
article from 2017 written at one of the local newspapers in Indiana, and it states that the
reporter said she talked to Nicky sister, and Niqui’s sister actually admits that at some
point she had a relationship with Tommy. There’s zero information behind that I have
no idea when it was, was she having an affair with Tommy, [Brit: woah]
Was this forever ago and Tommy wanted to continue it and she’s like, no I’m moving
on, I have a fiancé now, I have a life now. But possibly there was some romantic history
other than him wanting something and she not. Now Tommy does have a violent streak,
the one thing that her sister had said from way, way back was that one time she had
actually gone to visit her sister at her apartment and as she’s walking down the hallway
toward her door, she start hearing screams so she immediately barges into her apartment
and she says her sister is like sitting on a chair with Tommy over her and she’s got her
legs like her knees are up by her own chest and she has one of her feet into Tommy’s
chest like trying to push him off of her, and when her sister walks in she screams and
says that he was trying to rape her, and this it never gets reported but her sister says
she’s convinced that if she wouldn’t have been there or something would have
happened that night.
So another piece of information that I found out in this 2017 article, but again I can’t
substantiate through anything else, is the day that Niqui went missing she called a
female friend and said that after she was doing her laundry she was going to stop by a
pharmacy. This female friend that she called also had a relationship with Tommy, at
some point, so if we’re believing all this new information in this article, it’s possible
that Niqui had a relationship with Tommy at some point, this other woman had a
relationship with Tommy at some point, we have no timeline for when this happened
all we have on this phone call is this other woman’s statement of what Niqui told her,
now Nicky didn’t have her purse or anything and there’s no record for going to a
pharmacy so she might have had a plan to but, also this might have been a lie that this
92

Ellen Seppälä
woman told because she didn’t want to say what they’re really talking about, but it just
kind of muddies the waters so many years later
Brit:

Yeah definitely adds a different layer to consider at least.

Ashley:
Right, right. Tommy won’t talk to the police and so obviously this puts him also in that
person of interest category, they think that he’s definitely got some information that
would lend to answers in this case but they can’t get anything out of him and again this
is where things just stall out.
Police and the family get a call from a psychic that says Niqui died the same day that
she was at the laundry mat and that they would find her body in a trench near the laundry
[Brit: whoa] and law, right, and law enforcement actually at takes this pretty seriously
and they do a full search and they’re searching the trenches along, around the
laundromat but unfortunately find absolutely nothing, and they really upped the ante
and they offer a hundred thousand dollar reward if someone can bring home Niqui.
Brit:

That’s a really high amount, I mean you work with crime stoppers, they give out awards
[Ashley: crime stop] right?

Ashley:
A, a thousand dollars [laugh].
Brit:

Right,

Ashley:
One of those
Brit:

That’s a lot of money.

Ashley:
Yeah, and especially I mean again we’re talking like what two thousand, somewhere
between two, two thousand and one [2001], two thousand two [2002] maybe at the
time, um, so ten years ago, it’s even more money [Brit: right.] But this doesn’t lead
anything, like they, the family thought for sure like someone could’ve, would’ve, who
was scared before it but for a hundred thousand dollars people are going to come
forward, but absolutely nothing, the five year anniversary rolls around, they hold a
candlelight vigil at the laundromat, begging for answers, and again just absolutely
nothing happens.
The next time there’s any kind of movement or flicker in this case is August 30th of
2007. Tommy Swint gets hired as a police officer in Trotwood, Ohio, which is near
Dayton. And Richmond PD hear about this and they’re like “oh hell no”, so they reach
out to the Trotwood PD and say Hey I don’t know if you know who you hired. But he
obviously didn’t disclose to you that he’s a person of interest in our case, they laid it all
out for them and basically what Trotwood told Tommy was okay you can resign, or
we’re gonna start taking steps to have you terminated and he resigns, but immediately
turns around and sues them basically saying he was forced out. Tommy’s lawsuit ends
up going nowhere he doesn’t get anything from it, nothing good anyways, but this lands
93

Ellen Seppälä
Tommy all over the news, and shortly after he is featured on the front page, a [sic]
anonymous tip comes into the Dayton police. On November 29th 2007, and there’s very
limited information but the tip basically says “Hey, you need to look at this guy for an
unsolved murder back in 1991 of Tina Marie Ivory.” This is 16 prior and so the pro, uh,
the police decide okay I mean, why he’s, he’s already a person of interest [Brit: right]
in this other case we at least need to follow up on this lead and they didn’t have, they
had DNA from the crime scene of Tina Ivory 16 years ago but there was nothing in the
system linked to anyone else, and basically the only way they’re going to solve this
case is if they had a suspect that they could compare the DNA to, and lucky for them
Brit:

Oh my word

Ashley:
Richmond police actually had his DNA during this whole trial where Tommy was
trying to sue the police and saying you know I never even knew I was a person of
interest, they had, they never even told me they wanted to talk to me, or look into me,
and so at the time police were trying to call his bluff and they said okay if you’re willing
to cooperate, we’d love to take DNA from you and he said sure go ahead and, they
didn’t enter into any kind of database at the time because you know they really only
thought they were going to connect him to Niqui’s disappearance and they didn’t have
anything to compare that to, so they just held on to the sample.
But when they got this new lead they actually sent that sample out to Dayton’s crime
lab, and sure enough he is a match for this 16 old murder. Now they try and reexamine
the evidence because okay to me, if there’s a DNA match, like apparently it was on the,
cloth, that she was wrapped in
Brit:

Oh weird

Ashley:
That would be perfectly enough for a pro, for the prosecution and to send this guy in
jail but it wasn’t enough for them so they go back and reexamine all of the evidence,
and they actually get a palm print off of the tarp that she was wrapped in and they say
okay if we can match this palm print to him and the DNA to him that shows that not
only was he near her body, but then he was the person that wrapped in this tarp and
there’s really no way out of that.
Brit:

Right.

Ashley:
So November 17th of 2009, Tommy had recently moved to Alabama and they track him
down, interview him, get his prints and, in the interview, um it what, I can’t find this
addressed directly anywhere in documentaries or in any of the articles I read, but in the
video I saw of him being interrogated, dude is wearing another police uniform.
Brit: No!
Ashley:
Yes, and I’ve seen it referenced that, that he was an officer at the time but I can’t figure
out where he was an officer, or how the hell he like passed all these screenings again
94

Ellen Seppälä
and nobody caught it, but yeah he was in Alabama as a police officer. [Brit: uurh] When
they questioned him the only question him about Tina. And not at all about Nicki
they’re really focusing on the case that they have evidence on and they’re not trying to
get side tracked, they want to get this guy in prison and then see where they can go
from there. So they get his palm print before they leave Alabama, so they collect his
palm print, take it back to Dayton, Ohio and sure enough, it is a match and they take all
of this evidence together and go to a grand jury and on February 3rd 2010 the grand jury
indicts him for Tina’s murder.
The police in Dayton, Ohio immediately call the Alabama PD and ask them to go arrest
him and at 1PM that same day February 3rd, they go to his house and attempt to make
an arrest but, when the drive up to the house, they have their full team, they’re
surrounding the house. They get to the front door and right as they approach the front
door, they hear a gunshot. [Brit: gasp] Once they get into the house, they see that
Tommy is laying in the middle of the floor, gun in hand, he took his own life.
Brit:

No! [28:18]

Ashley:
Yes. So now there’ll never be answers in Niqui’s case, and they assume, I mean, they
had so much evidence in Tina’s case that it’s pretty obvious, and I, they’ve pretty much
closed that, but they didn’t even get the chance to question him, about Niqui’s case so.
I know he was a person of interest, I know it’s it kind of seemed like a good lead but I
thought her fiancé seems like a really good lead too, so what if he had nothing to do
with, I mean really now he is, his name has been forever tied with Niqui McCown’s
case, but what if it wasn’t him.
Brit:

And no one’s ever gonna look for anybody else.

Ashley:
Right, right. So, I keep wondering, you know, if there’s any more women, you know,
there’s this woman 16 years ago, what are the odds he killed this woman 16 years ago,
gets away with it and then decides to kill again so many years later. And the woman he
killed 16 years ago, she was a woman who is down on her luck, she was a prostitute,
Niqui seem to have her life together, she was getting married, had a child, she had a
job, like they’re two totally different profiles. I just think it’s super unlikely that in all
of that time
Brit:

He didn’t kill again.

Ashley:
Right, and, I also think it’s super weird that the first time, I guess maybe not, the first
time he killed they found the body almost right away, even though they couldn’t tie it
to him. The body was found and still in 2017, we haven’t a single clue where Nicky is,
so where would he have dumped the body, how would he have learned to dispose of a
body in such a better way, unless, of course, he did
Brit:

On his second try.
95

Ellen Seppälä
Ashley:
Yeah, right, you know, I mean, he could have gotten better, but I just think it’s crazy, I
mean, he’s a, he seemed to be a normal guy with a normal job and now I’ll always
wonder, if, Niqui isn’t the only person we should be asking questions about.

JUDGEMENT
and at this point I
think police are even
getting concerned as
well …
… they're, they're not
brushing the family
off anymore.
Tommy won't talk to
the police and so
obviously this puts
him also in that
person of interest
category, they think
that he's definitely
got some information
that would lend to
answers in this
case…
... but they can't get
anything out of him
and again this is
where things just stall
out.
Law enforcement
actually takes this
pretty seriously and
they do a full search
and they're searching
the trenches along,
around the
laundromat but
unfortunately find
absolutely nothing.
Richmond PD hear
about this and they're
like "oh hell no"
The police decide
Okay I mean why
he's, he's already a
person of interest in
this other case we at
least need to follow
up on this lead.

By 6:50, that's about
an hour later,
Modesto police
arrive.
And the first
detective on the
scene is Allen
Brocchini and he
looks around at the
house, Scott lets him
in without a warrant
and says Yes
absolutely look
around, everything
looks undisturbed.
And there's nothing
really to go off of but
Allen Brocchini says
like right from the
get go, Scott's
demeanor is wrong.
Warning flags for the
police like just go
flying.
so all of this went to
the police, the family
would say "Hey, you
know detective Allen
Brocchini, to
whoever, that go talk
to these people, they
said they've seen
Laci, maybe this will
help find her. they're
assuming that the
police are vetting all
of this, what we
learned later is, I
don't think they did a
great job of that even,
early on they really
have their sights set
on Scott.
and the police just
got restless and said
well, you know, we
are basically just
asking to see what
you would say, we
have a warrant
anyway
And the police
actually within a
couple of days
actually apprehend

the police whether
intentional or
unintentional are
really keeping them
totally separate cases
so this is also
something though
that Allen Brocchini
the lead detective
actually gets in some
trouble for later in
the trial, is dude flat
out like altered his
reports and kind of
lied because he didn't
like, like, he, on his
mind Scott did it and
he was trying to hide
this whole life from
Laci so what he
writes in his report is
that you know Laci
had never been to the
marina, she'd never
been to his work
bench.
the police have
nothing, all they have
are these phone calls
to Amber but the
more phone calls
they get, the less they
were like even try
and look at anything
else, I mean the more
they're focused on
Scott
the police decide like
okay we can't let
Laci's family find out
this way, we have to
tell them.
police have no leads
but again even in this
time where they
aren't moving the
case forward, they
still aren't tracking
down other leads. To
me this would have
been a good time if
the Scott angle wasn't
panning out, or you
at least weren't
getting anything new
and it wasn't enough
to convict him, it
wasn't up to take him
to trial. At least

..., and if he did say
something and
somehow he was
right, it wouldn't look
great that the police
ignored him even if
he did seem crazy
the deputy basically
tells him, even if we
found her, we
wouldn't tell you or

days since Misty,
quote ran away, so
they put her down as
missing instead of a

changing her status
didn't really change
their eagerness to

work into

case.
But something shifts
in investigators
minds because in
early December, the
sheriff's office
changes Misty's
official file once
again and list her as
missing under
suspicious

I know, but again, it's
not like police
weren't just
investigating this
lead, they really
weren't investigating
anything. Not talking
to her friends, not
talking to Rheuben,
and not talking to this
guy who got
convicted of picking
up a girl, almost
exactly where Misty
was last seen, raping
her and attempting to
murder her.
Police were now
taking the case
seriously that he's
kind of out of the
way. …
...[Brit: I feel like you
said that they're
taking it seriously
like 20 times but, all
20 times they weren't
really.] Ye, yeah I
guess you're right,
like they're taking it
more seriously? Each
time they get a little
bit more involved in
the investigation.
[Brit: Which is a
weird thing to say
since they're
supposed to own the
investigation.] I
know but they didn't.
investigators have to
start from square one,
and mind you, this is
6 months after Misty
went missing and
they just now start
interviewing
witnesses.
so after this police let
him go and they do
no more investigating
into him. [Brit:
what?] Yup, they list
him as a person of
interest but that is it.
They tell Diana that
he passed the
polygraph with flying
colors.[Brit: But

did, those results had
to be inconclusive at
best.] I would have to
think so

Diana was done with
the police, either they
were lying to her or
they were
incompetent, but
either way, she didn't
trust them anymore
deputies still had not
a single idea on what
the motive would be,
or why she would
have pulled over her
car. I mean, they had
more questions that
answers, and even a
month into the
investigation, they
didn't have a single
prime suspect
This is huge for the
investigators and
prosecutors, so they
put together a photo
line-up and they go
back to Mark Abbott,
who's clearly like the
most reliable witness,
wink, wink, sarcasm,
no he's not.
And this is the
beginning of a lot
that goes wrong in
the case against Josh.
First, I mean, the fact
that they're going to
Mark at all when he's
changed his story so
much to me is crazy,
but when they put
this photo lineup
together, they
basically do one
sheet and they tell
Mark that the person
they think did it is in
this lineup...

even the investigators
that were first on the
scene thought that
she pulled over for
someone she knew,
and she did not know
Josh. But in the
sheriff's mind, this
was a, but a minute
detail. In the sheriff's
mind, Josh fit the
profile of a killer
so the sheriff and the
prosecutor charged
him with the murder,
they say, you know,
we can't prove you
were here, but we
can't prove you were
away, so that's really
not a hang up for us
because growing up
you think, or at least,
some of us think that
police are honest, and

if one thing I've

times if you don't
have honest
prosecutors and you
don't have honest
detectives, they will
actually choose not to

this case was slowly
eating away at the
private investigator.
He said it bothered

was encouraging to

so this is also
something
though that
Allen Brocchini
the lead
detective
actually gets in

is dude flat out
like altered his

of lied because
he didn't like,
like, he, on his
mind Scott did
it and he was
trying to hide
this whole life
from Laci so
what he writes
in his report is
that you know
Laci had never
been to the
marina, she'd
never been to
his work bench.
the police have
nothing, all they
have are these
phone calls to
Amber but the
more phone
calls they get,
the less they
were like even
try and look at

mean the more
they're focused
on Scott
the police

even in this

me this would
have been a
good time if the
Scott angle
wasn't panning
out, or you at

getting anything
new and it
wasn't enough
to convict him,
it wasn't up to

looking at the

when police like

were like "I just

planning on
removing Misty
from the

labeling her a

the next day the

decided that

an interview…
"nope this girl is

file, like really
looks at it, there
is a key part of
the car that was
never processed
[Brit: what?]
And that part is
under the hood.
Which to me is
fricking crazy,
like you have
this mystery of
how is this car
accelerating but
you never
actually look at
the mechanics

of the car?
[Brit: laugh]
Like what
yahoo was in
charge that day?
[Brit: Right,
definitely]

which I can
totally see how
they thought
that, how many
stories have we
covered where
people have
been told by the
police that you
have to wait a
certain amount
of time.
We know police
hold things
back, I'm almost
certain [Brit:
right] that in the
years of their
investigation,
they must have
had a strong
idea of what
happened to
Rachel, or like a
tipster came
forward
The police
knew aaaa loot
more than they
were letting on.
I am shocked at
how much they
were able to
keep quiet in
this case.
