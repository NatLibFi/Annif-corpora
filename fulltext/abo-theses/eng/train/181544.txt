Title: The Use of Anglicisms in German, Swedish and Finnish Newspaper
Advertising
Supervisor: Brita Wårvik
The English language, today’s global lingua franca, is constantly gaining ground
worldwide, which also means that the influence of English on other languages is
continually expanding. English is the most widely spoken language in human history
and the language of international communication.
This crosslinguistic study investigates how English elements appear in the advertising
discourse of three European languages: German, Swedish and Finnish. The situation
with the lexical input of English into European languages is continually changing and
this means that each study on anglicisms provides a ‘snapshot’ of the situation at that
particular moment. There is thus a constant need for new studies of this language
contact phenomenon. The material of the present study consists of three issues of high
circulation broadsheet newspapers: the German newspaper Die Welt, Swedish Dagens
Nyheter and Finnish Helsingin Sanomat. The material was collected on June 1, 2019
and thus gives an overview of the anglicism situation in mid-2019.
The research questions of the study are the following: 1) How are anglicisms used in
German, Swedish and Finnish print newspaper advertisements? 2) What are the
differences and similarities in the use of anglicisms in the three languages?
The data of the study suggest that the use of English in advertising discourse is
common in all the three languages as the majority of the advertisements in each
newspaper issue contain anglicisms: 60 % of the German, 70 % of the Swedish and
55 % of the Finnish advertisements contain English elements. The findings also
suggest that there are commonalities in the use of English lexical elements between
German, Swedish and Finnish advertising language. Common uses of anglicisms in
the three European languages are, for instance, product and company names, technical
terms and slogans. Common motivations for the use of English in the three languages
might be the modernity and internationalism that English brings with it. Additionally,
there could be a lack of equivalent words in other languages to recently introduced
English terms, i.e. lexical gaps. These anglicisms might be, for instance, technical
innovations with an international English name that do not have equivalents in other
languages. Advertising is thus an important factor in language change as it functions
as the mediator of new, often English, terms, and enables them to spread globally.

1. Introduction
There is no doubt that English in today’s world has an influence on non-English
speaking countries, and instead, the question is what the “scale and nature” of
this influence is (Hickey 2020: 1). The extent of the English influence varies
across different social domains and the influence is especially strong in the areas
of advertising, technology and science, in all for different reasons (Hickey 2020:
1). The reason for the use of English in advertising is its supposed indication of
“sophistication and urbanity” whereas the use of English in technology and
science “derives from source research and innovation which is already
embedded in an English-language context” (Hickey 2020: 1).
The world as we know it today is increasingly internationalised and
mobile and that makes English more and more visible and present in European
countries that have official languages of their own. English is the language of
international communication (Rech 2015: 127) and it has the status as the lingua
franca of the Internet (Ștefan 2019: 137). “English has occupied a unique place
in today’s interconnected world” (Rahal 2020). Internationalisation implies
anglification (Josephson 2004: 133). Already in 1997 there were four non-native
speakers of English for one native speaker of English in the world (Sánchez &
Tuomainen 2014: 103), which is not surprising when taking into consideration
the “global trends of mobility and accessibility to information, places and people
worldwide” (Sánchez & Tuomainen 2014: 103). English in 2019 had
approximately 1,27 billion speakers who spoke English either as a native or a
second language (Duffin 2020). Most of the people who are able to speak
English have native languages other than English, and the increasing influence
of English is currently changing English into a second language instead of a
foreign language in many countries. “The real victory for English lies in its
importance as a second language” (Gottlieb 2000: 125).
The first large-scale “comparative treatment” of the phenomenon
of anglicisms was made by Manfred Görlach in 2001, when his project in the
field of lexicography resulted in The Dictionary of European Anglicisms, “the
first (dictionary) of its kind” (Görlach 2001: xv). Within the same project, the
most comprehensive contrastive undertaking of anglicisms in Europe thus far is
Görlach’s (2002) volume, English in Europe, which was compiled within the

1

same project and which describes anglicisms in sixteen European languages
(Onysko 2020: 191). This volume offers for the first time also a “pan-European
reference work of English lexical influence” (Onysko 2020: 191) and focuses on
those lexical units that are “recognizably English in form (spelling,
pronunciation, morphology)” (Görlach 2001: xviii) and leaves out all kinds of
loan formations (i.e. calques) (Onysko 2020: 191). In the foreword to Görlach’s
Dictionary, it is stated that elements of the English language “are being adopted
in a spectacular fashion, though with varying frequency, in […] the European
countries” (Burchfield 2001: viii).
The use and integration of anglicisms in different European
languages have been studied by Gester (2001), Jabloński (1990), NettmannMultanowska (2003) and Plümer (2000), among others (Onysko 2020: 191). One
of the major questions in anglicism research in the German language has been
the number of English elements in German, and this influence of English has
been observed growing (Onysko 2020: 192).
The frequency of anglicisms is dependent on the genre of language
use, with advertisements supposedly showing the highest rate of
English loans (see e.g., Kupper 2007). […] Apart from
advertisements, anglicisms tend to occur more frequently in certain
semantic domains of discourse, in particular in the terminology of
IT communication and new media, fashion and lifestyle, business
and sport.
(Onysko 2020: 192-193)
An undeniable reason for the use of English elements is the prestige of English.
Another possible reason according to Furiassi and Gottlieb (2015) is an
“unconscious xenophilic complex” (2015: 9) which tempts the speakers of
languages that are affected by English to use English. “Their use seems to grant
speakers the status, the authority and the allure they crave” (Furiassi & Gottlieb
2015: 9). Advertising language is innovative and creative and thus an optimal
field for anglicisms to flower. It is generally agreed that the language of
advertising does not form a variety of its own but is characterized by its “heavy
reliance on everyday language, youth language, technical language, and
dialects” (Rech 2015: 71). According to Rech (2015), advertising language
strives for innovation and is continuously changing.

This is a study of the use of anglicisms in the German, Swedish and Finnish
newspaper discourse and the paragraph above shows some examples of what
anglicisms might look like in newspaper advertising. The present study includes
a quantitative and qualitative analysis of a domain-specific use of English,
namely in the advertising language of the three European languages: German,
Swedish and Finnish. The quantitative analysis comprises a contrastive analysis
of the frequency of English lexical units in the three European languages
(Chapter 5.1). The qualitative analysis compares the use of English in the three
languages (Chapter 5.2). The research questions for the present study are the
following:
How are anglicisms used in German, Swedish and Finnish print newspaper
advertisements?
What are the differences and similarities in the use of anglicisms in the three
languages?
The inflow of anglicisms into the European languages has interested researchers
for several decades (Fischer & Pułaczewska 2008: x). Most of this attention has
been directed towards the language of news and advertisements, both of which
have been extensively studied for many decades (Fischer 2008: 2). Advertising
is a field where plenty of anglicisms are to be found (Görlach 2003: 30). Görlach
(2003: 30) suggests that the prestige of English is one reason why the national
dictionaries of several European languages are “flooded” by new English words.
These imports can also influence the morphology and phonology of the receptor
languages (Görlach 2003: 30). The anglicism situation is continually changing,
and thus the present study offers, as Darquennes et al. (2019: 5) put it, “a
3

‘snapshot in action’ of ongoing changes in our field of inquiry” (Darquennes et
al. 2019: 5).

2. Language Contact
This chapter presents theoretical background about the language contact
between English and the three languages in question and defines the basic
contact effects, codeswitching and borrowing. It also defines the most important
concept of the present study, anglicisms, as well as the field of the study, namely
advertising language.
Language contact occurs when speakers of different languages
interact, and their languages influence each other (Matras 2009). Today a lot of
this interaction happens online. Görlach (2001) suspected in the beginning of the
current century that the lexical input of English is going to continuingly increase
in other European languages and that the European languages are likely to
“become more similar to each other in due course” (2001: xvii). Many studies
(e.g. Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012) have indeed shown Görlach’s
hypothesis to be correct as the impact of English is growing stronger with the
“economic forces of globalisation” and the “rise of global media” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 565). The impact of English on other European languages is a
topical issue, due to its “pervasiveness and remarkable, but controversial,
sociolinguistic and cultural implications” (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012:
1).
Worldwide language contact prompted by global advertising, internet
communication, and other electronic media forms (e.g., social media
forms such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, the multilingual internet,
DVD, and entertainment technology) is unprecedented in the history of
human communication.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 565)
2.1 English in Europe
A big part of continental Europe is already politically affiliated in the European
Union and this is a good motivation for treating Europe as “one unit in a
sociolinguistic inquiry into the functions of English” (Mollin 2020: 34).
European countries share essential “historical and social commonalities” (Mollin
2020: 34). However, a common ‘Euro-English’ for the whole Europe is not a

4

Sara Hänninen
foreseeable development “(yet)” in the European countries, as the majority of
the respondents of the Standard Eurobarometer (2017) did not see themselves as
having a European identity and being part of the European community, which
would provide a fertile ground for a common variety of English to develop
(Mollin 2020: 34). Thus, rather than treating Europe as one sociolinguistic
community, Mollin (2020: 34) suggests that English instead should be studied
from the perspective of individual European countries allowing us to recognize
the vast differences between the European countries (2020: 34).
Britain’s exit from the European Union was lately suggested by
Modiano (2017, cited in Mollin 2020: 34-35) to support the progression towards
a Euro-English variety motivated by the “lack of British native speakers on the
EU level” (Mollin 2020: 35). However, a majority of the scholars (e.g. Gerritsen
2017, Schneider 2017, cited in Mollin 2020: 35) disagreed with these claims
made by Modiano (2017), especially Gerritsen (2017), by referring to the vast
differences between the European countries when it comes to the proficiency in
English and the use of English (Mollin 2020: 35).
The Nordic countries were suggested by Soler-Carbonell (2016:
56, cited in Mollin 2020: 36) to have “widespread knowledge of English”
according to the most recent Eurobarometer data (2012). The Southern and
Eastern European countries seemed to have less competence in English (Mollin
2020: 36), Eastern countries commonly complementing with another dominant
language instead of English, namely Russian or German (Mollin 2020: 36). The
Nordic countries have been successful in the matter of a “widespread high
competence in English” (Mollin 2020: 36). The central-western country,
Germany, is according to Mollin (2020: 36-37) reported to be placed behind the
Nordic countries, as only 56 % of German speakers report they are able to have
a conversation in English, this percentage in the Nordic countries being over 70
% (2020: 36-37).
Perhaps the most noticeable outcome of this language contact,
which has also attracted most research, are lexical borrowings from English to
other languages. Görlach (2003: 30) suggests that especially lexical loans are
common in European languages and other components of language, such as
syntax, might be less affected by English.

5

The type of linguistic contact of European languages with English is such
that, unsurprisingly, syntax has been little affected (if at all). By contrast,
the national lexicons are flooded by new imports which, the prestige of
English being what it is, can also affect, indirectly, the phonological and
morphological systems of the receptor languages.
(Görlach 2003: 30)
Additionally, Pulcini, Furiassi and González (2012) stress the visibility of
English lexical loans in the field of language contact, the one between this
international lingua franca and the languages of Europe. Pulcini, Furiassi and
González (2012) argue that these English-derived words and phrases in
European languages should be explored in order to find out more about the
change in European languages as well as how this influx of English into
European languages might even affect the English language.
“Lexical borrowing […] over the past decades, has come to affect not
only lexical units […] but also different types of phraseological units,
from phrases […] to idioms […] and proverbs. […] Hence, the languages
of Europe have been building a stock of mostly English-derived
vocabulary and phraseology, however diversified this phenomenon may
be, both quantitatively and qualitatively. From a linguistic perspective,
such a storehouse of shared vocabulary is difficult to quantify but worth
exploring, analysing and monitoring, in so far as it represents an
important factor of language change in both individual European
languages and, to some extent, in the English language itself.
(Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 1-2)
All languages that “operate” in the global market in the 21st century have been
and are affected by the influx of English vocabulary (Pulcini, Furiassi &
González 2012: 2). The reasons behind this widespread impact of English on
other languages, as has been noted earlier, are its status as the “lingua franca of
international communication” (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 2) as well as
the established use of English in academic and professional environments and
the increasing number of non-native speakers (Pulcini, Furiassi & González
2012: 2). Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 571) likewise remark that English not only
affects other languages but is itself affected by this phenomenon of lexical
borrowing.
English in itself is changing due to its contact with other languages and
its use in advertising and other forms of communication. Not only this,
6

Sara Hänninen
English cooperates and coexists with other languages from which it
derives its mixed character.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 571)
The lexical influence of English on the different European languages is, as one
might expect, uneven, and this is due to different “historical and linguistic
factors” (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 3). Several western countries, such
as France, Germany and Italy, have since 18th century been in intense
commercial contact with England and thus these countries have long-established
linguistic and cultural contacts with English. For the eastern European countries,
on the contrary, such as Poland and Serbia, the contact started first after the
eastern regimes fell in the late 20th century (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012:
3). Furthermore, in the 19th century western Europe, the French and German
languages played a special role in first borrowing and thereafter transmitting
English vocabulary to their neighbouring countries, German for northern and
eastern Europe, and French to western Europe, mainly in the “fields of sport,
fashion and technology” (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 3).“However, since
the mid 20th century – at the end of the Second World War – contacts and
borrowing have increasingly taken place directly from English” (Pulcini,
Furiassi & González 2012: 3).
Moreover, genetic similarity is another significantly affecting
factor when it comes to English influence (Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012:
3). Germanic languages, for example, such as English, German and Norwegian,
share a lot of their vocabulary and syntax, which means that an anglicism might
be identical or very similar to a “cognate native word in the recipient language”
(Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 3). In this case it is many times only a
semantic borrowing that takes place, whereas the influx of English vocabulary
in non-Germanic languages might more often lead to “non-adapted” borrowings
(Pulcini, Furiassi & González 2012: 3).
English is a popular foreign language in Germany, Sweden and
Finland. According to the Eurobarometer data (2012), 82 % of Germans, 93 %
of Swedes and 88 % of Finns think that English is the most useful foreign
language for their personal development (European Commission 2012: 69-70).
Additionally, Europeans were asked which language they consider most useful
for children to learn for their future. In this category the percentages of the
7

Europeans who prefer English were even higher: Germany with 94 %, Sweden
with 95 % and Finland with 89 % of the respondents choosing English (European
Commission 2012: 75, 78).
Two key concepts of language contact, codeswitching and
borrowing are discussed next.
2.2 Codeswitching and borrowing
The term codeswitching is often applied to the alternation of languages within
the same discourse (Matras 2009: 101). Earlier on, codeswitching used to be seen
as ‘language corruption’ by proponents of normative grammar but it has later on
become a field of investigation in its own name. Codeswitching is functional as
there are often several factors that motivate speakers to alternate between
different languages within a conversation. Language mixing is indeed a
multilayered phenomenon and switches between languages within the same
discourse can serve many different purposes (Matras 2009: 107).
A common distinction that is often made is between ‘alternational’
codeswitching and ‘insertional’ codeswitching. Alternational codeswitching
refers to alternating between different languages within utterances or sentences,
whereas insertional codeswitching means that a word or phrase is inserted into
an utterance in a different language system. Both alternational and insertional
switches might often be prompted by difficulties of “retrievability of adequate
means of expression in one of the languages”, and the term used for the
motivation for the switch is often referred to as the ‘trigger’ (Matras 2009: 105).
The term codeswitching often refers to spontaneous mixing in the conversations
of bilinguals (Matras 2009: 106).
The term borrowing in the broader context of general linguistics
normally refers to the diachronic process, i.e. the process over the course of time,
by which languages complement their vocabulary, or other “domains of
structure” (Matras 2009: 106). As one of the outcomes of language contact,
Matras (2009) defines borrowing as a change in the “structural inventory” of at
least one of the languages involved. This can be seen as importing a structure or
a form from one language to another (Matras 2009: 146). This is best known as
borrowing and the items influenced by this phenomenon are called borrowings,

8

Sara Hänninen
loans or transfers. The languages are often defined according to their roles as
donor and recipient language (Matras 2009: 146).
Although it is a well-established term, the term borrowing is at
times criticized because it as a metaphor is lacking accuracy (Matras 2009: 146).
Borrowing usually leads to “long-term incorporation of an item” (Matras 2009:
146) into the recipient language’s inventory. This means that a word is not just
borrowed from the donor language, because the borrowed word is most often not
intended to be returned to its “rightful owner” (Matras 2009: 146). This matter
of the donor language and recipient language of course leads to the question of
ownership. The term borrowing can according to Matras (2009) be seen as too
much emphasising the aspect of ownership and the “boundaries between the
linguistic systems” (Matras 2009: 146). Another term to use for borrowing,
which may describe the phenomenon more precisely, is the term replication,
which excludes the connotation of ownership that the term borrowing has. In his
writing, Matras (2009: 146) wants to point out that by borrowing he means a
replication of a linguistic structure “of any kind, in a new, extended set of
contexts, understood to be negotiated in a different language” (Matras 2009:
146).
It is not an easy task to explain how loanwords appear in a recipient
language and determine the probability of which words are going to be borrowed
and which not (Haspelmath 2009: 35). Haspelmath (2009) distinguishes two
main types of factors that are relevant when it comes to borrowing:
1) social and attitudinal factors (prestige of the donor language,
puristic attitudes)
2) grammatical factors (e.g. the claim that verbs are more difficult
to borrow than nouns because they need more grammatical
adaptation than nouns)
(Haspelmath 2009: 36)
The term borrowing is used when talking about language change, and more
specifically, completed language change (Haspelmath 2009: 38). This means, as
mentioned above, that borrowing is a diachronic process which starts with an
“individual innovation” and develops further and expands in a speech
community (Haspelmath 2009: 38). Borrowings are without exception lexemes,
i.e. words, and not phrases (Haspelmath 2009: 37). There are two different types
of borrowings: material borrowings and structural borrowings (Haspelmath
9

2009: 39). Material borrowings include loanwords, whereas structural
borrowings comprise loan translations, which are also called calques.
Haspelmath (2009: 39) defines calques as complex lexical units which are made
of a word-for-word translation of the original word. Common examples of
calques are compound words such as the German word herunter-laden (directly
translated from the English word down-load) and the English word loan-word
(created from German Lehn-wort) (Haspelmath 2009: 39). Additionally,
structural borrowings include loan meaning extensions, or merely loan
extensions. Loan extensions comprehend semantic borrowing in the sense that
the meaning of a word in the donor language is transferred to the recipient
language. A well-known example of a loan extension is the English word head,
which also has the meaning of main, and thus from English the German
equivalent for head, ‘Kopf’, has received the meaning of main as well
(Haspelmath 2009: 39). Another type of borrowing, though less common, is loan
blend, which Haspelmath (2009: 39) defines as a “hybrid borrowing” with both
borrowed as well as native material.
When identifying loanwords, it is important to eliminate the
possibility that the donor language word and the recipient language word
descend from a common ancestor (Haspelmath 2009: 44). A common ancestor
is often the reason for similar words over different languages.
Linguists identify words as loanwords if they have a shape and
meaning that is very similar to the shape and meaning of a word
from another language from which it could have been taken
(because a plausible language contact scenario exists), and if the
similarities have no plausible alternative explanation.
(Haspelmath 2009: 43-44)
2.3 Anglicisms
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines the word anglicism as “a
characteristically English word, phrase, or idiom, esp. one introduced into a
sentence in another language” (OED, s.v. anglicism). According to Onysko
(2007: 10), the term anglicism is used as a generic name to describe the
occurrence of “English language elements” in other languages (Onysko 2007:
10). However, the actual meaning of an anglicism may be harder than that to
define as Onysko (2007) states in the following.
10

Sara Hänninen

A closer analysis of the concept of anglicism unveils the existence
of the fuzzy boundaries between linguistic and cultural influences
and between changes imposed from the outside of the RL
[recipient language] and changes happening within the RL.
(Onysko 2007: 10)
In this study the term anglicism is used for the English language elements, more
specifically English lexical elements, that appear in the material irrespective of
whether they are borrowings or instances of codeswitching. We will return to the
definition in Chapter 4 on methods and materials.
There are multiple reasons for the use of anglicisms in other
languages. In the 1980s, the use of anglicisms was claimed to be a social factor
as it “reflects the sender’s mastering both of foreign language and of social
norm” (Söderberg 1983: 11, cited in Ștefan 2019: 137). Another notable reason
behind the dominant status of English in today’s world is the technological era
we are living in where new technical products develop constantly, names of
which often are in English. As has been noted earlier, we are provided with
global access in an unprecedented manner for example in academic publishing
and the platforms of social media. The use of anglicisms in the domain of
advertising discourse is discussed further in Chapter 3. We will now turn briefly
to the languages that constitute the materials for this study of anglicisms.
2.4 German
The German language is an official language in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland and a minority language in Belgium, France, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Italy and in eastern Europe (Russ 2005: 5). German is the mother
tongue of approximately 105 million people and additionally 80 million people
speak it as a second language outside the German speaking countries (Lingoda
2019). The present position and structure of German is stable, and its
independence is not being called into question (Pörksen 2008). However,
German is undergoing a change in the era of globalization and the “unparalleled
popularity of English” had already in the 1990s a big influence on it (Clyne 1995:
6). This development can be seen for instance in the publications of German
academics, of whom the vast majority nowadays publish in English instead of

11

German (Pörksen 2008). Additionally, industry and commerce are areas where
the English language is dominating today (Pörksen 2008). An integral part of the
“universal age” (Pörksen 2008) is technology, especially communication
technology, which is receptive to international vocabulary.
2.5 Swedish
Swedish is the official language of Sweden and one of the two official languages
in Finland (Reuter 1992: 101). The majority of Sweden’s population of 10
million inhabitants speak Swedish as their mother tongue. In Finland, Swedish
is spoken by a minority of the population, with 290,000 native speakers (Norlin
& Olsson 2019). Today Swedish and English are the two languages with the
highest status in Sweden (Josephson 2018: 131-132, 135). The Swedish
language still dominates the everyday ‘linguistic practices’ of the majority of
Swedish population. However, these practices are nowadays often multilingual
(Josephson 2018: 125). This means that the majority of Swedish population
encounter English on a daily basis, e.g. via advertisements, technological
instructions and films in English. English is becoming more and more important
in Sweden and is proposed by Josephson (2018: 125) to be in due course
considered as a second language instead of foreign language (Josephson 2018:
125).
Swedish is a Germanic language that has a long history of
linguistic borrowings, as it has in the course of history been affected by German
in the Middle Ages and by French in the 18th century. The English language has
affected Swedish from the early 19th century and the strongest inflow of English
loanwords into the Swedish language has been since World War II (Stålhammar
2017). Since World War II, English of all languages has had the most notable
and dominant influence on Swedish. This influence shows up in three different
ways: as English lexical loans that are imported into Swedish, as codeswitching
in spoken and written context, and in switching completely from Swedish to
English in certain domains, such as science and working life domains. English
is the natural scientific language favoured in university studies (Josephson 2004:
69, 133-136). Most of the big Swedish companies use English as the common
language of their corporate group (Swe. koncernspråk) (Josephson 2004: 136).
This does not necessarily mean that English is spoken in the workplace, rather,
12

Sara Hänninen
that the central documents, for instance, are all found in English (Josephson
2004: 136). The use of English is also a hierarchical question. The higher
position you have the more English is used (Josephson 2004: 136).
In recent decades, a large number of anglicisms has been
introduced to Swedish. Reasons for the high degree of adoption of English loans
in Swedish are that the Swedish population meet English often in their daily lives
and that they also respond well towards English. Some semantic categories, such
as fashion and beauty, include more lexical level borrowing from English than
others (Ștefan 2019: 137).
Anglicisms carry social prestige associated with the superiority of
the Anglo-American culture in the Swedish society, as reflected in
the high number of Anglicisms that have been adopted in the last
decades.
(Ștefan 2019: 137)
Lindblom et al. (2013: 9-10) suggest that Sweden has after joining the European
Union in 1995 become increasingly culturally monogamous 1 partly due to the
dominating Anglo-American film and entertainment industry in Sweden.
Another reason for the continuous influx of English in Sweden is the world of
advertising: English or pseudo-English is wrapped into advertisements
irrespective of the country where the advertisements appear.
English loans in Swedish seem nowadays to be more often
borrowed in their original form instead of adapting them to Swedish with
modification of the spelling of a word, as for instance the verbs mejla and pusha
(Bijvoet 2020: 20-21). An ongoing study on English lexical loans and their
flexion by Aktürk Drakes (2019, cited in Bijvoet 2020: 21) showed a clear
tendency for English loanwords in Swedish to retain their original forms. Thus,
it seems nowadays more common to use e.g. the noun approach in its clear
totally English form instead of modifying English verbs into Swedish, such as
the verb renewa, in Bijvoet’s example sentence “Jag behöver renewa mitt
körkort” (Swe. ‘I need to renew my driving license’) (Bijvoet 2020: 22).

”Våra kunskaper i språket i vårt största exportland, Tyskland, har blivit sämre och franskan
upprätthålls av allt färre. I stället har vi blivit allt mera kulturmonogama: Film-och
nöjesindustrin är nästan undantagsvis angloamerikansk, reklamvärlden förpackar, oavsett
hemland, sitt budskap i engelska eller låtsasengelska” (Lindblom et al. 2013: 9).
1

13

Abrahamson (2013: 14) describes the status of English in Sweden
as a journey of no return.2 Abrahamson expresses his concern over the future of
the Swedish language as English gradually takes more and more space in
Sweden and suggests that the future of the Swedish language is in the hands of
its users, the ‘consumers’, when speaking the language of consumerism
(Abrahamson 2013: 14-15). The dominance of English in Sweden can be noticed
also in the choice of Swedish daily newspapers, as in Svenska Dagbladet, for
instance, Russian names as well as other Slavic languages with Cyrillic alphabet,
are no longer transcribed into Swedish but instead, merely the English
transcription is used. This Abrahamson calls a domain loss (‘domänförlust’), i.e.
Swedish is losing ground to English (Abrahamson 2013: 15-16).
2.6 Finnish
Finnish is one of the two official languages in Finland with approximately
5,275,00 native speakers (Branch 2017: 22). Finnish is a Finno-Ugric language
(Branch 2017: 22) and is a typologically different language to English, German
and Swedish. English is not an official language in Finland, but it is the most
spoken foreign language in Finland (OSF 2018). According to the self-reported
study by Official Statistics of Finland, English is spoken by 90 % of Finns aged
18 to 64 (OSF 2018). English has been widely used and available in Finland
already for a few decades due to the different “informal channels” such as nondubbed TV and other formats of media (Vaattovaara & Peterson 2019: 2). “The
constant exposure to English through mass and social media, as well as the
educational situation, offers [sic] fertile ground for English loans to become
adopted” (Vaattovaara & Peterson 2019: 2).
The linguistic situation in Finland allows a three-way distinction:
Finnish and Swedish are official languages, spoken by 90.04% and
5.39% of the population respectively (see OSF’s Population
structure: Language), whereas English is the expanding lingua
franca with a 78% of the population having a communicatively
efficient competence in that L2 (see data from National survey on
”Engelskan [sic] ställning i Sverige tycks vara en sputnikresa med hunden Lajka, det vill säga
en färd utan återvändo. […] Det finns tyvärr ingen naturlag som säger att vi får behålla det rika
svenska språket hur länge som helst. Allt hänger på hur vi användare, vi konsumenter, för att
tala konsumismens språk, är medvetna om vårt arv. Och hur politikerna styr. Språk kan göras
tyngdlösa” (Abrahamson 2013: 14-15).

2011).
(Sánchez & Tuomainen 2014: 103)
In Finland, World War II was a significant turning point when the influence of
English started to grow. Even though Finland rejected the Marshall Plan
assistance after World War II, Finnish culture was influenced by American
culture through American films, TV series, magazines and advertisements.
Hiltunen (2015: 378) calls this “ajatusten Marshall apu” (Fin. ‘the Marshall aid
of thoughts’), which strengthened the position of English in Finland as well as
increased its visibility in the Finnish culture (Hiltunen 2015: 378). Its influence
can be seen in the following decades after World War II in the increasing number
of English loanwords in Finnish (Hiltunen 2015: 378).

3. Advertising language
Language has a significant role in the fields of marketing and advertising. A
crucial point of advertising is the choice of language to convey specific messages
with the intention of influencing people (Evans 2000). This chapter defines
advertising as well as advertising language.
3.1 Advertising
Advertising can be very generally defined as “the promotion of goods or services
for sale through impersonal media” (Collins Concise Dictionary, cited by Cook
2001: 9). “The crucial feature which distinguishes advertisements from related
genres is their function, which is always to persuade people to buy their product”
(Cook 2001: 10). Although the function of the majority of advertisements is to
persuade the addressees to buy the product advertised, advertisements have other
functions as well. Other aims, such as to amuse, inform, misinform, worry or
warn, are all “in service” of the main function, which is to sell (Cook 2001: 10).
We are all exposed to advertising. Advertising takes many forms,
but in most of them language is of “crucial importance” (Trudgill 1985: vii).
“The wording of advertisements is, in most cases, carefully crafted to meet
particular ends” (Trudgill, 1985: vii). Frequently the intention is to inform, but
more often, above all, to persuade and influence.

15

The most important thing is that the advertisement sticks out and
catches the attention of the reader. “[The advertiser’s] ultimate success will
depend in the first place on his message catching the reader’s eye” (Gill 2013:
55). This instance and opportunity of catching the reader’s attention is extremely
brief, it is “gone almost as soon as it appears” (Gill 2013: 55). The advertisers
use various means to accomplish this objective, and these are called attention
getting devices, or attention getters for short (Gill 2013: 55-56).
Advertisements that are mostly based on text are a “special type of
visual stimulation” (Harasimczuk et al. 2018: 431). These advertisements often
contain a lot of information about the advertised product, but they may as well
display the slogan as the main part. A big ‘advantage’ of advertisements based
on text are that they attract the recipients’ attention because the process of word
recognition and reading words in us humans is automatic. “Due to its automated
character the process of word recognition require [sic] little cognitive capacity
for literate recipients” (Harasimczuk et al. 2018: 431).
Words are magic. They are magic in the sense that when they are
presented with a word or wordlike letter string, a literate subject cannot
help but read. The processes involved in word perception are evoked
without volition even when it is disadvantageous to do so. […] There is
evidence […] that word identification can take place even when exposure
conditions are such that subjects do not believe that they have seen any
stimulus at all.
(Prinzmetal et al. 1991: 902)
Words in general attract attention automatically and involuntarily in the
recipients of advertisements. What is the role of English words and phrases then,
in the field of advertising in other languages than English? English words might,
for instance, act as attention getters, and this is discussed further in the following
chapter, which digs deeper into advertising language.
3.2 Advertising language
Marketing and advertising are undergoing dramatic changes mainly because of
globalisation. Multilingualism has at the same time started to become a “major
phenomenon” (Piller 2003: 170-171) in advertising language and it was
estimated at the beginning of 2000s by Piller (2003) to continue to expand in the
future. According to Piller (2003: 170), more attention than before is being paid
16

Sara Hänninen
to advertising language as a site of language contact, which has earlier been a
relatively under-examined topic (Piller 2003: 170). English has the role of the
“major international contact language in the advertising of non-English-speaking
countries” (Piller 2003: 171). The main reason to use foreign languages in
advertising seems to be their quality of attracting the attention of the reader. The
use of a foreign language in advertisements is something that can be seen
deviating from the norm and thus surprising the reader. This makes an
advertisement to stand out and these foreign language elements in
advertisements are as a matter of fact called attention getting devices (Nederstigt
& Hilberink-Schulpen 2018: 3). Readers will also spend more time reading and
processing an advertisement to make sense of it if it includes foreign elements,
which might consequently lead the reader to remember the advertisement better.
English is the most common foreign language used in advertisements in nonEnglish speaking countries as can be presumed that English is, if not spoken, at
the minimum understood widely throughout the world. The fact that English is
known in large parts of the world, however, might diminish the efficacy of
English as an attention getter if it is a familiar language to the reader (Nederstigt
& Hilberink-Schulpen 2018: 3).
Foreign words, in particular ones derived from English, were
suggested to ‘invade’ German advertising language already in the 1960s 3, as
Römer (1968) called the advertising language an “Einfallsort”, ‘a place of
invasion’ [SH translation] of foreign words (Römer 1968: 124). The reason for
the rise of particularly English in German advertising language was suggested to
be that English, especially American English, was advancing in West Europe
and other parts of the world. The influx of English loanwords into Germany was
greater after 1945 than ever before in history (Römer 1968: 124). Additionally,
Römer (1968) wants to point out that German advertising language is certainly
not the only language affected by English, but instead, other European

”Die Werbesprache ist ein Einfallsort für Fremdwörter, besonders englische, wenn auch nicht
einzige. […] Daß gerade das Englische, besonders das amerikanische Englisch, auf die
deutsche Werbesprache einwirkt, hängt auch damit zusammen, daß es in ganz Westeuropa und
in anderen Teilen der Welt vordringt. Seit 1945 ist ein größerer Schub Fremdwörter englischer
Herkunft nach Deutschland gekommen als jemals zuvor in der Geschichte” (Römer 1968:
124).
3

17

languages, such as Danish and French, have also been proven to include English
loans in their advertising language (Römer 1968: 124-125).
In Germany, foreign words were already in the 1960s suggested to
have been a marker of a “finer lifestyle, furnishing, fashion and meals since time
immemorial” [SH translation] 4 (Römer 1968: 125). In Die Welt newspaper issue
from September 24th, 1960, it was even argued that the German language was
not suitable for e.g. perfume advertisements, and that German perfume names
seemed “ridiculous, limited and even ill-sounding”

5

[SH translation] (Römer

1968: 125).
Another prominent scholar of advertising language in the 1960s,
Geoffrey N. Leech, presented in 1966 some ideas on advertising that still are
relevant today. In 1966, Leech suggested that the study of advertising language
could be approached from a view that the advertising copywriter has “at his
disposal a huge repertoire of linguistic choices” (Leech 1966: 3). However,
Leech also points out this view being “misleadingly simple” (1966: 4), as the
advertising copywriter in reality is not that free to make linguistic choices.
Factors such as the medium through which the advertisement is spread, the
audience and “the very fact that he is writing an advertisement and not a political
speech or some other kind of composition” naturally affect the choices of the
copywriter (Leech 1966: 4). Additionally, Leech (1966: 4) suggests that
advertising language in general is rather colloquial than formal. This might,
actually, still be very true today with the increasing amount of conversation-like
codeswitching finding its way to advertisements.
Advertising language has been studied from various perspectives
which can mainly be assorted into the following three categories:
1) linguistic approaches
2) literary approaches
3) semiotic approaches

(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 568)

The linguistic approaches to advertising language can be further divided into the
following four categories: “a) linguistic / structural approaches; b) semantic
”In Deutschland wurden seit alters die Gegenstände der feineren Lebensführung,
Wohnungseinrichtung, Mode, Speisen gern mit fremden Wörtern benannt” (Römer 1968: 125).
5
“Über Parfümnamen wurde in der „Welt“ vom 24. September 1960 geschrieben, die deutsche
Sprache eigne sich nicht für Parfümnamen, deutsche Parfümnamen wirkten lächerlich,
beschränkt, sogar unschön im Klang“ (Römer 1960: 125).
4

18

approaches; c) pragmatic approaches; and d) psycholinguistic and informationprocessing approaches” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 568). What these approaches
have in common is that they mainly view advertisements from the monolingual
perspective. Central topics in these analyses are “deception, media literacy, the
Gricean notion of conversational maxims and preferred structural choices”
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 568). In their study, Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) attempt
to fill this gap by proposing a “plurilingual approach to advertising discourse”
which is based on research on bilingual verbal behaviour (Bhatia & Ritchie
2013: 568). Three prominent features of this plurilingual approach are the
following:
1) Advertising is essentially a mixed system- a system of verbal
and nonverbal components (pictures, music, etc.) […]
2) The verbal component of an ad mirrors the two critical
complementary aspects of bilingual / multilingual verbal
behaviour – i) ability to keep two (or more than two) linguistic
systems separate; and ii) ability to integrate and mix the two (or
more than two) systems.
3) Although language-mixing is an integral part of multilingual
verbal behaviour, society often views it negatively and regards it
as a sign of linguistic deficiency.
(2013: 568)
The field of advertising language is well-established and has interested linguists
for a long time, e.g. Cook (2001), Goddard (1998) and Hermerén (1999) (cited
by Piller 2003: 170). As has been noted earlier, language contact phenomena in
advertising had until the beginning of 21 st century been relatively unnoticed by
researchers of advertising language (Piller 2003: 171). However, borrowings and
loanwords, which are relevant in the present study as well, were actually among
the first aspects of advertising language to receive any linguistic attention at all
(Piller 2003: 171). “These were appropriated as a purist concern early on” (Piller
2003: 171). An example of this is the collection of “Allerhand
Sprachdummheiten” ‘All Manner of Linguistic Stupidities’ by the German
philologist and historian Gustav Wustmann (1903), in which Wustmann makes
a list of non-German words in German advertising (Piller 2003: 171). Nowadays,
of course, there can be seen a change in the attitudes towards loanwords and
borrowings in advertising and anglicisms are not anymore considered only as
Sprachdummheiten ‘linguistic stupidities’, but they form an integral part of
19

advertising language. The attitudes towards language mixing in advertising will
be further discussed in Chapter 3.5.
Studies on Swedish advertising language had not been made to the
same extent as studies on English and German advertising language when
Petterson (1974) made her study on Swedish advertising language (Sw.
reklamsvenska). Petterson (1974) states that the literature on Swedish
advertising (in the 1970s) was not broad (Petterson 1974: 2). English advertising
language instead had been studied already in the 1960s e.g. by Penttilä (1962)
and Leech (1966) and the German advertising language by Römer (1968).
English is suggested by Smith (2013: 28) to appear in Swedish
advertising to a growing extent. Smith calls this influx of English in Swedish
advertisements not only accelerating, but also an explosion 6 (Smith 2013: 28).
Göransson (2013: 51) chooses to describe this phenomenon as the “invasion” of
English and furthermore, the Swedish advertising language being ‘infected’

7

[SH translation] by English (Göransson 2013: 51-52). Erixell (2013: 38)
likewise proposes that Swedish decision makers and advertisers fancy English
when it comes to place names, for instance. A good example of this is the
traditional Swedish province of Östergötland, the name of which was recently
changed to an English one and thus the province is nowadays advertised also to
the Swedes by the name East Sweden. English can be found in Swedish
advertisements in slogans and phrases and also as separate words. Smith
proposes that English in slogans like Make yourself heard (in an Ericsson ad in
1990s) or What is everyone else doing? in a more recent tablet advertisement
might signal trust and sound cooler than if these slogans were in Swedish

8

(Smith 2013: 29).
English elements seem to also permeate modern Finnish
advertising language and the English influence has recently been growing
rapidly which can be seen in the growing proportion of English elements in
Finnish advertisements (Hiltunen 2015: 377). The trend is particularly strong in

”Sedan jag flyttade till Sverige har jag sett allt fler inslag av engelska ord och fraser i svensk
reklam. Det ser ut som om ökningen accelererar, som en explosion.” (Smith 2013: 28)
7
”Reklamspråket är infekterat av engelskan […] engelskans invasion också av reklamspråk”
(Göransson 2013: 51-52)
8
” engelskan används på ett sätt som inger förtroende. […] Och en smula coolare än Vad gör
alla andra just nu?” (Smith 2013: 29).

advertisements targeted towards young people whose English proficiency might
be higher than the older generations. English can be used without a fear of
alienating the audience. Additionally, regardless of the age of the target group,
certain fields use more English in advertising than others, such as sports,
technical products, music, fashion and cosmetics. An example of this is the
slogan “Real style, real design. Esprit Shop naiselle ja miehelle.” (Fin. ‘Esprit
shop for women and men.’) (Hiltunen 2015: 377). Advertising has a significant
role in language change as the functions of this medium are not only to present
new products, but also to introduce new terms related to the product. Hiltunen
(2015) argues that English is the dominating source of new terms, which reflects
its superior status as the lingua franca of technology and economy.
It is challenging to come up with suitable Finnish equivalents to
established English words used in advertising, especially when it comes to terms
of innovations in the fields of information technology and consumer electronics.
This leads to the use of the original vocabulary. Hiltunen (2015) proposes that
another reason for the use of English is the globality of advertising and English
being this international advertising language of our modern information society.
English is the fundamental meeting place of languages and cultures (Hiltunen
2015: 378).
There are several reasons why advertising is a relevant aspect to
delve into when investigating the current phenomenon of the spread of
plurilingualism around the globe. Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 565) list the
following three reasons as the main justifications for the relevance of advertising
in the fields of study of language contact and plurilingualism:
i) in many areas of the world, advertisers consciously or
unconsciously favour plurilingualism;
ii) advertising is an integral part of modern-day communication;
and
iii) language use in advertising has profound implications for
communication generally.
(2013: 565)
A common concern for international advertisers is how to sidestep the paradox
of globalisation and localisation, that is whether to give more weight to the
global or the national and regional “interests, appeals, affiliations etc. in terms

21

of formal and functional linguistic manifestations” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 566).
“This concern has manifested itself in the form of the ‘standardization’ vs.
‘adaptation’ debate in international advertising, media and marketing” (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 566). A dilemmatic question for the marketing world is whether
to customize advertising to meet the different preferences of individuals or not
in “the era of multinational companies” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 566). However,
what there is no doubt about is the choice of language of the global advertisers,
the language naturally being English (Bhatia & Rithie 2013: 566).
English is the choice of global advertisers and marketers. English
has effectively dethroned its competitor languages, such as French
and Russian, in this arena and continues to do so with more vigor
and dynamics; thus becoming the single most important language
of globalization. […] The language choice is settled.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 566)
As previously discussed, the language choice of international advertisers is often
English. According to Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 567), international advertisers
follow an innovational approach that is based on plurilingualism and are thereby
able to optimally resolve the paradox of globalisation and localisation referred
to above. This approach brings about communicative accommodation, which is
a central ingredient for “gaining maximum appeal for the product in terms of
creating favorable affective consequences” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 567).
From the spectacular growth of the use of English in global
advertising one should not conclude that English is a super
language that has conquered all the discourse and structural
domains of advertising. The globalization of English does not
mean that other languages in the world have been dethroned and
English can invade global advertising at will.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 593-594)
Along similar lines, Görlach (2003: 32) states that English is used playfully in
advertisements, often to reach a specific stylistic effect or to “designate elements
of foreign (anglophone) cultures” as well as in product names (Görlach 2003:
32).

22

Sara Hänninen
3.3 Structural categories of an advertisement
Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) view advertisements as discourse units (2013: 577)
and identify different “domains of an advertisement” (2013: 579). They outline
the following structural categories for advertisements.
1) Product name
2) Company name or logo
3) Labeling and packaging
4) Pricing
5) Slogans
6) Main body
7) Headers and subheaders

(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 579-581)

Some structural domains of advertisements are more open to English influence,
or in the words of Bhatia and Ritchie “within easy reach” for English to conquer
(2013: 579). English is used in these domains of an advertisement “neither
randomly nor symmetrically” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 579).
English is […] capitalizing on those domains which are within its
easy reach such as product names and lexicon associated with
product types such as computers, technological and fashion
products. […] New technologies such as the internet and
multimedia have provided a special boost to English usage. The
discussion of futuristic themes and developments is often carried
out by means of keywords which are drawn from English.
Numbers, graphs, and figures are presented in English.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580)
Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) want to concretise the pattern of the use of English in
advertisements and thus propose a structural hierarchy that they present in “a
staircase fashion” (2013: 581). That means that the staircase consists of steps,
each of which English has to pass in order to get to the next one. Before reaching
the highest step of the staircase, which is the main body of the advertisement,
English must according to their view reach all the other steps of the staircase.
After reaching the first step of product naming, Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 580)
suggest that the doors open for English to conquer other, more difficult steps,
i.e. other structural domains such as company name. The domains that include
English form in their view an implicational hierarchy, which could mean that if

Product names are most often nominal or one-word structures
(Rech 2015: 67). An important quality of product names is that they are not
limited merely to a “referential, indicative function” (Rech 2015: 66) as proper
names are. If product names compare to real lexemes, such as in the examples
“Kleenex, TruValu” (Rech 2015: 66), they carry denotative and connotative
meaning and hence give information about the product (Rech 2015: 66). In order
to increase “the consumer’s preferences for a brand” (2015: 66), it is particularly
important that the product names are easy to pronounce, applicable to the product
and also ones that evoke positive connotations (Rech 2015: 66). Additionally,
Piller (2003: 172) tells us that Haarmann (1984a, 1984b, 1986a, 1986b, 1989)
found that the product name is the element of an advertisement where a switch
into a foreign language occurs most frequently. However, slogans and other
elements of the advertisement may be in English as well in non-English speaking
countries (Piller 2003: 172).
The domain of company names is next to product names the area
that shows “most preference for English among parts of ads” (Bhatia & Ritchie
2013: 579). One reason that has encouraged the use of English in this domain is
the globalisation of business (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 579). English is also
strongly favoured in abbreviations and acronyms which employ English “on a
near-universal basis” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580).
Thirdly, English is “overwhelmingly” preferred in the labels of
products found in advertisements (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580). Additionally,
English is found in numerical information of advertisements, such as in graphs
or phone numbers as well as in packaging information (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
580). When it comes to the language of pricing, a trend towards increased use of
English is clearly visible. This is shown, for instance, in the use of English or
U.S. currency in Spanish advertising in Latin America. Another example of
English used in the language of pricing is its constant use in discount
information, e.g. “40% off”, in Japanese ads otherwise completely in Japanese
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580).
The fourth domain includes headers and subheaders, which prefer
the native languages over English and are more difficult for English to access
(Bhatia & Richie 2013: 580). However, Bhatia and Ritchie have observed
English elements also in this structural domain (2013: 581). Headers and
25

subheaders that are totally in English are often nominal or phrasal in structure,
such as “‘a feast of elegance’ (phrasal) and ‘Golden Moments. McDowell
Moments’ (nominal)” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580-581). The use of English in
headers is “discouraged” if the headers go past the phrasal level and form a
sentence or conjunct sentence. Nonetheless, as previously mentioned, English is
becoming more and more present in the different domains of advertisements and
this is the case with headers and subheaders as well (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
581).
According to Rech (2015: 65), headers are the most important part
of a print advertisement. Headers are of all parts of print advertisements the part
that is most probable to be read, i.e. as much as five times more probable to be
read than other parts of text in an advertisement (Rech 2015: 65). Headers
function as catching the readers’ attention, and they therefore must be the most
salient feature of an advertisement. The salience is accomplished e.g. by placing
the header apart from other text parts of the advertisements and by using larger
font size compared to the other text parts of the advertisement. The function of
a subheader is to connect the headline with the other structures of the
advertisement (Rech 2015: 65).
English appears less often in slogans than in the domains of
product and company names (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580). How English is used
in slogans in advertisements differs from its use in product and company names,
as English appears in sentence-like structures in slogans instead of the nominal
or one-word structure which is, as previously mentioned, favoured in product
and company names (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580).
The main body of the advertisement is the part of the advertisement
which includes the product descriptions and instructions on how the product is
used, i.e. “explanations about the utility of the product” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
580). This structural domain differs from other domains with regard to its
“preference for a sentence-like structure” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580). The
main body of an advertisement is a domain in which native languages often
“override English” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 580) and is in fact the hardest
“barrier” for English to overcome according to Bhatia & Ritchie (2013: 580).
However, English is continuously creeping into this domain as well by means of

26

Sara Hänninen
other more accessible domains such as product and company names (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 580).
3.4 Multilingual advertising
The language of advertising can hardly be considered a variety of its own, but it
is characterized, as has been noted earlier, by its “heavy reliance on everyday
language, youth language, technical language, and dialects” (Rech 2015: 71).
According to Rech (2015), advertising language strives for innovation and is
continuously changing. From the early 2000s onwards, researchers (e.g. Kupper
2007 cited in Rech 2015: 78) have noticed an increase in English expressions
and multi-word elements in German advertising. For instance, Janich (2013)
observed that English elements in German advertising increased principally in
certain product groups, such as fashion, technical products, travel, cosmetics and
in salient textual elements, such as slogans and headers (Janich 2013, 161 cited
by Rech 2015: 78).
The language of advertising works like a magnifying glass for
language innovations, because it takes up trends of everyday
language and uses them in a concentrated fashion and introduces
them to the masses. […] Not only are current trends of everyday
language employed in advertising, the creative use of language in
this medium sometimes makes its way into colloquial usage
(Janich 2013, 46). Despite being tightly intertwined with the
language of everyday life, the language of advertising is special,
because it is carefully designed to fulfil a specific function and thus
constitutes an artificial use of language.
(Rech 2015: 71)
Advertising language “strives for innovation” (Rech 2015: 73) and that has led
to an “increasing complexity of English elements” used in German
advertisements since this kind of contact phenomena in advertising began to
occur (Rech 2015:73).
As advertising seeks to influence consumers to the advantage of
advertisers, many consumers meet advertising with scepticism and
adapt to new advertising techniques with increasing resistance.
This results in a constant need for innovation and change and thus,
advertising continuously strives for linguistic originality.
(Rech 2015: 73)

27

According to Onysko (2007), anglicisms are often used as “emotional tools to
create an atmosphere of modernity”, especially in the language of
advertisements (Onysko 2007: 69).
According to Piller (2001), English slogans in advertisements that
otherwise are in the native language might suggest quality. By the use of English,
the advertisement shows the reader its assumption that the reader is bilingual.
The reader of an advertisement is “constructed” as a bilingual with the choice of
both English and German elements.
The intertextual allusion to the common phrase “Made in
Germany” suggests high quality, usually of technical and craft
products, reinforces the connotations of “quality,” and, crucially,
constructs the implied reader as someone who knows English.
Given the facts that the rest of the advertisement is in German and
that it appears in the context of a German newspaper, the
implication of this linguistic choice is that the implied reader is
constructed as bilingual in German and English. Bilingualism is an
element of the narratee’s sophistication as a superior business
executive who holds values of tradition and quality.
(Piller 2001: 154)
English is the language of global advertising (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 595).
According to Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 594), it seems that advertisers around
the world either knowingly or unknowingly prefer bilingualism or even
multilingualism over monolingualism, and this applies both to the promotion of
local and global products. This suggests that advertisers expect that their readers
have “some degree of bilingual competence” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 594) and
even in cases where the customers complained about the unintelligibility (which
has happened for example in Japan), the advertisers are not willing to abandon
using English. The advertisers of the travelling field, such as hotel companies,
for instance, often use English to approach the reader. “Taking advantage of the
internationalisation of English, hotel companies search for words that are
recognizable for the client” (Giménez Folqués 2015: 150). Tourism vocabulary
is one field where anglicisms have been noticed to increase (Giménez Folqués
2015: 153).
English possesses an “attention-getting function” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 594). This was observed for instance in Japan, where what was not
understood drew people’s attention. It was noted in Japan that there is a trend of
28

Sara Hänninen
English being used for ‘cosmetic’ reasons, that is, as an attention-getting device.
“This adds yet another dimension to the pattern of global bilingualism and
English is often considered as a ‘cool’ language to attract attention” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 594).
Through globalisation, which according to Barnet & Cavanagh
(1995: 13) was the trendiest word of the 1990s, English has become the “leading
vehicle for the homogenisation of global advertising discourse” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 582). Globalisation grants us access to different parts of the world
in a way that was not there before. “[In] our day […] writers of advertising copy
offer themselves as poet laureates of the global village” (Barnet & Cavanagh
1995: 14). English is the number one transmitter of global cultural discourse
which can be seen, for instance, from the American films, television and music
that have spread worldwide. This means that English lexicon unifies the
advertising throughout the globe (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 583).
English has acquired a unique place in global advertising. Bhatia
and Ritchie (2013: 588) call the new ‘invisible’ dimension that English has
acquired in advertising worldwide ‘the mystique factor’ (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
588). Advertisers often choose English even though they could use an “existing
translational equivalent of English” or come up with a new corresponding term
in the native language. English sells (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 588), but what are
the reasons behind it? We find some suggestions to this question when we turn
to the threshold figures of the socio-psychological effects, which Bhatia and
Ritchie (2013) claim merely English being able to transmit.
Our analysis of the invisible social-psychological features which
English has acquired in the process of being used in global
advertising shows that English is often called into service to
achieve certain positive and exclusive effects.
(2013: 588)
These core socio-psychological features proposed by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013)
are shown in Figure 2. The socio-psychological features are classified into
thresholds by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 589). They argue that the threshold
features (on the left), once acquired, open the access to the proximity zones (on
the right). In their view, the proximity zones can be characterized as “subsets of
29

threshold features” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 589). The threshold categories are
like doors in a house, providing access to different rooms, that is, to the different
proximity zones, “which in turn can lead the way to other related zones” (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 589). Bhatia and Ritchie propose that once these threshold
features are acquired, “like an entry to a house, the access to proximity zones
(different rooms) becomes opened, which leads to domino effect” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 589).

Figure 2: English: Socio-psychological features
(adapted from Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 589)

These features presented above are proposed by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) to
multiple “like a splicing and copying gene”, resulting in the previously
mentioned domino effect (2013: 591). “Threshold features such as American
culture are opening the way to a proximate zone of other relates features” (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 591). The repertoire of the socio-psychological features is large
already, but new features are also turning up (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 591). The
Figure 2 above is returned to in Chapter 6.

Sara Hänninen
Besides the socio-psychological effects discussed above, English,
as other languages as well, comprises other “literary and psycholinguistic
functions” such as rhyming, reduplication, puns and slogans (Bhatia & Ritchie
2013: 591). Advertisers aim at these kinds of “special effects and creative
meanings” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 591) that English can provide. The creativity
brought by English allows advertisers to “conquer” the possible negative
evaluations towards language mixing (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 591). Chapter 3.5
will dig deeper into the three common attitudes toward language mixing.
3.5 Attitudes toward language mixing in global advertising
Bhatia and Ritchie (2004/2006, cited in Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 569) introduce
three attitudes taken toward language mixing in global advertising, namely the
negative, the positive or systematic and the neutral view (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
569). This chapter introduces and briefly discusses these three attitudes towards
language mixing in global advertising.
Firstly, the negative attitude is a universally popular attitude
towards language mixing amongst the population in general, which has its roots
in the view that mixing between languages is an “unsystematic form of
behaviour” and thus considered as some kind of ‘language deficiency’ (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 569). Purism and linguistic prescriptivism throughout the world
have a long history. It is both monolinguals and even bilinguals who have seen
mixing between languages as an indication of poor linguistic behaviour. If
bilinguals are made conscious about their language mixing, what often happens
is that they apologize for the “‘bad’ verbal behaviour” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
569-570). Viewing multilingual advertising from the negative view on language
mixing means that language mixing would be seen in advertisements to be
unprofitable for the advertisers. However, the governing attitude on language
mixing cannot be negative if we have a look at advertisements where the use of
different languages is evidently frequent. Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 570) suggest
that advertisers not only consider language mixing in advertisements natural but
also are willing to include language mixing in their advertisements (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 570).
Secondly, according to the neutral view, language mixing is
regarded as achieving subordinate cosmetic effects, e.g. “ad hoc attention
31

getting” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 570). Language mixing according to this view
has a short-term effect and advertisers are thought to use language mixing only
to catch the attention of the reader. This, nevertheless, is not accepted by Bhatia
and Ritchie (2013), as they claim that the reasons for language mixing in
advertisements go far beyond the “one-time charm”, which language mixing in
advertisements merely has according to the neutral view (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013:
570).
Thirdly, the positive, or systematic view sees language mixing in
global advertising in the following manner:
It views language-mixing as a systematic and rule-governed
phenomenon which satisfies the creative needs of bilinguals,
especially those needs that can be met neither effectively nor
efficiently by means of the single, separate linguistic systems
which are at the disposal of bilinguals.
(Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 570)
The positive view regards language mixing as capable of fulfilling the more
profound “innovative and creative” needs of advertisers to build up the wanted
persuasion effects as well as effects of naturalness in the advertisements, along
with other socio-psychological effects (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 570). The
positive view agrees with the contemporary position of language mixing adopted
by the majority of sociolinguists. Language mixing with English in global
advertising is an expanding field and English is presumed to be “the single most
important linguistic source for the promotion of global bilingualism and for
linguistic creativity” (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 570-571).

4. Materials and Methods
Manfred Görlach pointed out in 2001 that the situation with the lexical input of
English into European languages is changing fast and therefore he deliberately
aimed to produce a “‘snapshot’ view of a particular point in time” (Görlach 2001:
xvi) when he composed his dictionary of European anglicisms. This is naturally
the case with the present study as well. The material for this study was collected
on the 1st of June 2019 and thus it is a portrayal of the anglicism situation in mid2019. In the present study, the main aim is to find out how and where anglicisms

32

Sara Hänninen
are used in the German, Swedish and Finnish advertisements and to compare
these uses of anglicisms.
4.1 Materials
The present study examines the use of anglicisms in the German, Swedish and
Finnish context. More specifically, the present study examines the use of
anglicisms in the genre of advertising language, and in order to do this, one big
quality daily newspaper from each country was chosen. The material for the
present study comes from the three national daily newspapers: German Die Welt,
Swedish Dagens Nyheter (DN) and Finnish Helsingin Sanomat (HS). These
three quality dailies rank among the top three in terms of circulation in each
representative country (Ojala et.al. 2017: 478): Germany, Sweden and Finland.
The newspapers have online versions, and the digital readers form a big part of
the audience. The present study examines the printed versions of these
newspapers. The material for the present study consists of 201 advertisements,
which all contain anglicisms in the headline, slogan, product name or another
text part of the advertisement. In order to enable a closer analysis of the different
uses of English in the three languages, a limitation into one issue per newspaper
had to be done. The present study has its focus on the qualitative analysis of the
anglicisms, i.e. the different uses of anglicisms in the advertisements and this
closer analysis could only be done by limiting the number of newspaper issues
to three in total.
4.1.1 Die Welt
Die Welt is a nationwide German quality daily newspaper. It is published since
1946 and it is one of the three most high-circulation newspapers in Germany
(Bernreuther 2012: 66). In the third quarter of 2019 Die Welt had the circulation
of 117,800 copies (Koptyug 2019). It has a strong focus on the most recent news
(Rogoyska & Zboch 2016: 27). Die Welt has received the European Newspaper
Award several times and counts as one of the leading newspapers in Europe
(Welt Online 2019). The newspaper publishes a special newspaper issue on
Sundays, namely Welt am Sonntag, which is the “market leader” as it is the

33

newspaper with the highest reach in Germany of all the quality Sunday
newspapers (Media Impact 2018).
4.1.2 Dagens Nyheter (DN)
Dagens Nyheter, published in Stockholm, is the biggest circulating quality
newspaper of Sweden (Adler 2018). Its daily print circulation in 2018 was
265,000 (Orvesto Konsument 2018 in Adler 2018). The readers of the printed
DN newspaper live mainly in Metropolitan Stockholm, also known as Greater
Stockholm (Sw. Storstockholm) (Orvesto Konsument 2018). Digital readers of
DN are as likely to be from other parts of Sweden as from Greater Stockholm
(Orvesto Konsument 2018). DN readers are interested in being up to date with
what happens in the Swedish society and in the world, and they are active in
cultural events, as well as in the restaurant and entertainment branches. They
spend more on travel, fashion and furnishing than an average Swede (Orvesto
Konsument 2018).
4.1.3 Helsingin Sanomat (HS)
Helsingin Sanomat is Finland’s leading national newspaper, and it can be
characterized as a prestige newspaper (Blanco & Kheradmand 2011: 442). Both
DN and Helsingin Sanomat have been published for over 100 years and are
owned by big media houses and they reach similar sizes of audience (Tervahauta
2019: 36). In spring 2016 the printed newspapers were still the most popular way
to read newspapers in Finland, revealed the Finnish national readership survey
(Jyrkiäinen 2019). In the spring 2016, printed newspapers were read by 80
percent of the population aged over nine years every week. Reading on a
computer was the second most popular way, used by 51 percent of the population
(Jyrkiäinen 2019). In 2019, the total daily circulation of the printed and the
digital HS was 339 437 (Media Audit Finland 2020).
4.2 Methods
The ever-evolving contact situation between English and other languages of the
world poses challenges for researchers of anglicisms. As Görlach (2001: xviiixix) points out in his Dictionary of European Anglicisms, it is not always easy
(or even possible) to know whether an English word already is integrated in the
34

Sara Hänninen
lexicon of another language (Görlach 2001: xviii-xix). Additionally, there will
be ambiguity whether an English word e.g. in a German advertisement really is
meant as a German word or if English words rather are merely used in
advertisements to catch the attention of bilingual readers (Görlach 2003: 30).
These questions might often remain beyond the capabilities of a linguist to find
out.
In societies largely competent in English as an additional language there
is an increasing amount [sic] of uses of English words which are not
meant as borrowings but are addressed to bilinguals, often in a specialist
or a playful, highly colloquial fashion. […] The playful uses […],
characteristically from journalese and advertising (in a wider sense), are,
then, not meant to introduce permanent loanwords into German (most are
of course not even properly English, but facetious coinages using English
items).
(Görlach 2003: 64-65)
The present study includes all recognizably English elements in the
advertisements, some of which already are loanwords, while others are not
established loanwords in the lexicon of the language of investigation. The
inclusion criterion in the present study is that the words appear fully English in
form. This means that English words with morphological endings, i.e. suffixes,
in languages other than English, have not been included. An example of such a
case is the slogan Bästa Dealen, found in the studied issue of DN, where the
English word deal is given the Swedish definite article (suffix) -en. Additionally,
the word appen, found in DN advertisements and derived from the English app,
was excluded as it is conjugated. These are recognizably English elements as
well. However, a clear distinction had to be made, and in this study this
distinction means that only English words that are completely English in form
have been counted as anglicisms. This was also Görlach’s (2001) approach in
his dictionary of European anglicisms. When viewing the results of the present
study, it is important to note that words such as the ones presented above may in
other studies be counted as anglicisms.
To find out to what degree the English elements are integrated,
three big and modern digital dictionaries of each language were used. These are
the German dictionary Duden, Swedish Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL)
and Finnish Kielitoimiston sanakirja. Thus, the results of the present study
include a discussion on how many, and which, English elements were found, but
35

also, to what degree these English elements already are integrated into the
languages of investigation. Even more established loans are counted as English
elements when they appear in English phrases or compounds. In the Swedish
advertisements, for example, the pronoun all is counted as an English element
in the compound all inclusive even if the pronoun has the same form in Swedish.
Additionally, the words modern and design, which are more established loans
in Swedish, are counted as English elements as they appear in totally English
phrases in the material. The lists of the anglicisms in the tables with both the
already integrated loanwords and new elements are found in Appendices D (Die
Welt), E (DN) and F (HS).
When it comes to the functions of anglicisms, it is important to
bear in mind that the functions do often overlap and thus it might often be
impossible to separate the functions from each other (Rech 2015: 120): one
anglicism might fit into many categories and not only one. “As a rule, several
functions are at work at the same time and can hardly be separated from each
other” (Rech 2015: 120). In the present study, an attempt has been made to
categorize and present the anglicisms found in the material in a systematic
manner according to their possible functions. This, however, does not mean that
there were no other possible ways of categorizing the functions. Rather, the
chosen categorisation is an attempt to choose the most prominent function of
each anglicism in order to make sense of the data and present it in an intelligible
manner to the reader.
As mentioned above, the advertisements in each newspaper were
closely examined and all the advertisements with recognizably English elements
in their spelling were collected for further examination. A quantitative
contrastive analysis was done in order to find out to what degree anglicisms are
used in the advertisements in each of the newspapers. This was followed by a
qualitative analysis examining the uses of anglicisms in the context of
advertising language and the degree of integration of the anglicisms into the
recipient languages’ inventory.

4.2.1 Quantitative methods
In the present study the differences in the German, Swedish and Finnish use of
lexical anglicisms are quantitatively analysed and this quantitative contrastive
analysis of the material aims to answer the following questions:
How many advertisements in total are found in each newspaper issue and how
many of these advertisements contain English elements? What percentage of the
advertisements contain English elements?
4.2.2 Qualitative methods
The qualitative analysis includes a contrastive analysis of the use of anglicisms
in newspaper advertisements in the three languages, namely German, Swedish
and Finnish. The qualitative analysis uses both Bhatia and Ritchie’s (2013)
model of structural domains of advertisements and Rech’s (2015) framework of
the functions of anglicisms and this is discussed further in Chapter 5.2. The
qualitative part of the present study aims to answer the following questions:
How are anglicisms used in German, Swedish and Finnish print newspaper
advertisements? What are the differences and similarities in the use of
anglicisms in the three languages?

5. Results
This chapter presents the results of the present study. Chapter 5.1 presents the
results of the quantitative analysis and Chapter 5.2 shows the results of the
qualitative analysis.
5.1 Frequencies of anglicisms in the newspaper advertisements
Of the total of 198 advertisements in the chosen issue of Die Welt newspaper,
119 (60 %) include English elements. There are 79 advertisements (40 %) which
do not contain any English elements. The chosen issue of Dagens Nyheter
includes altogether 85 advertisements, of which 59 (70 %) contain English
lexical elements and 26 (30 %) do not contain them. The issue of Helsingin
Sanomat contains altogether 42 advertisements of which 23 (55 %) contain
English elements and 19 (45 %) do not contain them. Figure 3 below shows the
37

percentages. The number of advertisements in each newspaper is included in
brackets after the percentage.

Figure 3: Advertisements with and without anglicisms in the sample issues
of Die Welt, Dagens Nyheter, and Helsingin Sanomat
Figure 3 shows a similar trend in all three newspaper issues. The fact that the
majority of the advertisements in each newspaper issue include English elements
suggests that the use of English elements in the advertising language of all three
newspapers is common. As these three newspapers have high circulations, we
can perhaps suggest that advertising is a likely context in which newspaper
readers in Germany, Sweden and Finland encounter English. However, more
newspaper issues would be needed to see the trends in anglicisms more widely
and precisely. The newspaper issue with the highest percentage of
advertisements with anglicisms is Dagens Nyheter, henceforth DN, with 70 %
of the advertisements containing anglicisms. The second highest percentage is
found in Die Welt with 60 % and Helsingin Sanomat, henceforth HS, takes the
third place with 55 % of its advertisements containing English elements.
5.2 The different uses of anglicisms in the newspaper advertisements
This chapter presents the results of the qualitative analysis. The examples of
English elements from each newspaper (and thus language) are presented in the
order of German (Die Welt), Swedish (DN) and Finnish (HS). Anglicisms are

38

Sara Hänninen
marked in bold and the advertisement number is included in brackets after the
anglicism. The lists of the advertisements with anglicisms are found in
Appendices A (Die Welt), B (DN) and C (HS). The anglicisms are presented in
alphabetical order.
Table 1 below presents an overview of the popular advertisement
types, i.e. popular topics in the advertisements that contain anglicisms. All three
newspaper issues use English when they advertise travel and transportation,
technical devices, cultural events and entertainment such as cinema. Other
popular advertisement types that use anglicisms in one or more of the studied
newspaper issues are holiday resorts, luxury products and different stores such
as florist’s shops and furniture shops. Car advertisements, which include English
technical terms, are found in DN and HS and are presented in a table of their own
(Table 11).

The following sections present examples of the English elements in the
advertisements that constitute the material of the present study. The material is
categorised into five categories, which are based on the frameworks by Bhatia
and Ritchie (2013) and Rech (2015). As mentioned in Chapter 3.3, Bhatia and
Ritchie (2013) view the different structural parts of an advertisement as different
“domains of an advertisement” (2013: 579), which include, among others,

39

product and company names, logos, slogans and the main body of an
advertisement. Rech (2015) classifies anglicisms in advertising according to
their functions. The present study includes two different kinds of categories:
1. Categories 1, 2 and 3 are based on the content of the English elements as
follows:
1) Product name, company name and logo
2) Slogans and phrases only in English
3) Technical terms
2. Categories 4 and 5 concern the motivation for the use of English elements:
4) Internationalism, modernity and general attractiveness
5) Filling word gaps
This means that this study first presents the cases where anglicisms are used
based on the content and then further discusses the motivation for the use of
anglicisms. Each of these categories is given a subchapter of its own. The first
three categories, types of anglicisms based on the content, are naturally related
to the motivation of using English in advertising, and this is discussed further in
the following chapters.
5.2.1 Product name, company name and logo
English elements are found in advertisements that use the English in the name
of the company, the product or in the logo. Examples of these are presented in
Tables 2 (Die Welt), 3 (DN) and 4 (HS) below. Some product names also fall
into the category of technical terms. Die Welt contains altogether 119
advertisements with anglicisms, of which 30, i.e. 25%, contain anglicisms falling
into the category of product names, company names and logos. Table 2 below
presents examples of anglicisms in this category found in the issue of Die Welt.

In Table 2 we find anglicisms in the names of international events, such as Berlin
Art Week (108, 118), holiday resorts, such as Hotel Aviva ****s Make Friends
(97) and Excelsior – Dolomites Life Resort (76), as well as in travel and
transportation advertisements: Transocean Kreuzfahrten (35) and TUI Cruises
(29). Additionally, luxury products, such as watches and design sofas, are
included: Rolex – Oyster Perpetual Sky-Dweller (119) and Mondrian Sofa
Collection (105) as well as investment company names such as Ökoworld (4)
and Allianz - Global Investors (4).
To find out to what degree the anglicisms in Table 2 already are
integrated loanwords in German, each of the English elements in the table was
searched in Duden online dictionary separately, also the English words that make
a part of a phrase. Of the English elements in Table 2 above, 23 are integrated
into the German lexicon, i.e. English lexical loans in German. The integrated
words include the adjectives superior, global, royal and real as well as the nouns
Girl, Resort, River, Spa, Family and Investor. There are 31 English elements
that have not (at least yet) made it to the German lexicon. The adjectives private,
first, black, perpetual and lazy are not considered as German words. English
nouns that are not integrated loanwords in German include Oyster, World,
Group, Foundation, Auction, Consult, Life, Friend, Gallery, E-Mountainbike,
Luxury and Cruise.
Of the 59 advertisements with English elements in DN, 51 fall into
the category of product names, company names and logos. This accounts for 86
% of all the advertisements with English elements in this newspaper issue. Table
3 below presents examples of DN anglicisms in this specific category.

As Die Welt, also DN includes anglicisms in company names in the field of travel
and transportation: Avra Beach Resort (5) and Royal Stockholm Cruise Line
(17). Luxury products, such as expensive watches, are as well commonalities
between Die Welt and DN: Sjö Sandström- Royal Steel Classic (31).
Additionally, cultural events are found in DN advertisements: Stockholm Jazz
Festival (15) and Foodtech Village (33). MOOD Stockholm is a shopping centre

opened in 2012 that strives for an international feeling not only by the English
name MOOD but also in signs and shop windows inside the shopping centre
(Lindblom et al. 2013: 10). Words such as grand, noble and royal appear among
the English company names in the examples of Grand (a movie theatre in
Stockholm), Noble Entertainment and Royal Greenland. Advertisers might aim
for an attractive and modern image for their enterprise through English in the
company names. This is further discussed in Chapter 5.2.4.
There are 13 English words in Table 3 that can be classed as
Swedish words according to the Swedish online dictionary SAOL. Words such
as beach, resort, mascara, jazz, festival and sound are integrated loanwords with
English origin. The product names in Table 3 include altogether 42 English
words, some of which are a part of a phrase, that have not been integrated into
Swedish. These include nouns, such as village, lipstick, mood, house, sense,
project, honey, network and air condition, and the adjectives royal, noble,
grand, classic, honest, organic, financial, telescopic and true.
There are altogether 18 advertisements in HS with anglicisms in
the category of product name, company name or logo. These 18 advertisements
make up 78 % of all the HS advertisements that include anglicisms. Table 4
below presents examples of anglicisms in this particular category.

As Die Welt and DN advertisements, also HS advertisements in this category
include anglicisms in product names in the field of travel and transportation:
Finnair Holidays-matkat (8). Additionally, big international companies are
found among the anglicisms in this category: e.g. Android One (1) and HMD
Global (1). English is also found in several product names, such as iGrill 3 (2),
SolarXon-Aurinkopaneeli (22) and Ultimate Luxus Tynnyrisauna (9), as well as

45

in names of cultural events, such as music performances: Rockfest - KISS End
of the Road - World Tour (16) and Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow Rock
Memories 2019 (14).
The anglicisms presented in Table 4 above include four words that
are integrated loanwords in Finnish: rock, mini, super and market. There are 50
anglicisms that are foreign words and not Finnish words in Table 4. Holidays,
Pro, Premium, Ultimate, House and Finance are examples of the words that
are not integrated in Finnish.
There is a clear difference between the German newspaper issue
and the Swedish and Finnish newspaper issues in the number of occurrences in
the category of product names, company names and logos. In the issue of the
Swedish newspaper DN, this particular category is found in 85 % of the
advertisements that include English elements. HS as well includes anglicisms in
this category in 78 % of its advertisements with English elements. Anglicisms in
this particular category only comprise 25 % in the German Die Welt newspaper
issue. Thus, the percentages of DN (86 %) and HS (78 %) are relatively similar
whereas Die Welt differs a lot with only 25 % of its advertisements including
anglicisms in this category. These similarities and differences are further
analysed in Chapter 6.
As discussed above, travel and transportation are common fields
in all the three newspaper issues to use English elements in their product and
company names. Anglicisms commonly appear in in the context of travel
advertising because of the status of English as a universal language (Giménez
Folqués 2015: 149). TUI Cruises (Die Welt 29), Royal Stockholm Cruise Line
(DN 17) and Finnair Holidays-matkat (HS 8) are examples of travel company
and product names that use English in their advertising. Other common products
with anglicisms include ‘luxury’ products, such as watches, e.g. Rolex – Oyster
Perpetual Sky-Dweller (Die Welt 119) and Sjö Sandström- Royal Steel Classic
(DN 31) as well as fine saunas: Ultimate Luxus Tynnyrisauna (HS 19).
Additionally, English is used in advertising of cultural events, such as music
performances and art festivals. We can see this in all three newspaper issues:
Berlin Art Week (Die Welt 108, 118), Stockholm Jazz Festival (DN 15) and
Rockfest: Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow Rock Memories 2019 (HS 14).

5.2.2 Slogans and phrases only in English
The material of the present study includes several slogans and phrases only in
English. This is a phenomenon found in all the three newspaper issues. Through
the use of English elements companies can position themselves as international
in their advertising (Rech 2015: 127). According to Rech, when internationally
operating brands advertise in Germany, they can accustom advertisements to the
German market or advertise in the world language English (Rech 2015: 127).
Even though most advertisements are designed for the German
market, many use English elements through product names and
slogans, which often remain in English to communicate that the
company is engaged in global commerce.
(cf. Kelly-Holmes 2005, 77, cited in Rech 2015: 127)
There are 35 advertisements in the category of English slogans or phrases in the
studied issue of Die Welt. This means that 29 % of all the 119 Die Welt
advertisements with anglicisms include English slogans or phrases. The slogans
are often inserted after the name of the brand, e.g. Schaffrath - Unique since
1923 (1) or NCL – Feel Free (18), as shown in Table 5, which presents the
English slogans and phrases found in the issue of Die Welt.

Of the anglicisms in Table 5, 12 are integrated loanwords into German. A
Gourmet, which is in Merriam-Webster dictionary defined as a “connoisseur of
food and drink” (M-W 2021), is one of the already integrated English loanwords
in German. Additionally, the nouns Bike and Family as well as the phrase made
in are considered as integrated loanwords in German, even when all of them
have German equivalents: das Fahrrad (Ger. ‘bike’), die Familie (Ger. ‘family’)
and hergestellt in (Ger. ‘made in’). There are 37 instances of anglicisms that
have not been integrated into German in Table 5. Such adjectives include
unique, free, contemporary, first, next, leading, Swiss and romantic. Health,
Gallery, Fair, Art, Estate, Auction and Collection are examples of the nouns in
Table 5 that are foreign elements in German.
Out of the 59 advertisements including anglicisms in DN, 16
advertisements include slogans and phrases only in English, which makes for 27
%. As in the German advertisements, also in DN the English slogans and phrases
often appear after the product name, e.g. Subaru – Confidence in Motion (46)

There are six anglicisms in Table 6 above that count as Swedish words: business,
lime, motion, ambition, design and innovation. All these six anglicisms appear
in clearly English phrases and thus can in this context be considered English
elements. Some of them, however, are already more established loanwords in
Swedish, such as design, innovation, motion and lime. The rest, altogether 44
anglicisms, which were searched individually in SAOL dictionary, are foreign
elements. Examples of foreign English words in Swedish include the adjectives
silent, royal, classic, amazing, open and clever.
The Finnish newspaper issue HS includes English slogans and
phrases in four of its advertisements, presented in Table 7 below. That is 17 %
of all the advertisements in HS with anglicisms. Only the anglicism just is an
integrated Finnish word, the rest are foreign words. The word just, however,
might also appear in Finnish through the Swedish influence on Finnish.

The percentages in the category of Slogans and phrases only in English are
similar in the newspaper issues of Die Welt (29 %) and DN (27 %). The
percentage in the Finnish newspaper issue, HS, is lower, namely 17 %. Possible
reasons for this are further discussed in Chapter 6.
Both DN and HS include two same slogans in their car
advertisements, namely Toyota’s slogan Always a better way (DN 49, HS 3) as
well as Škoda’s Simply Clever (DN 52, HS 20). Both Die Welt and DN show
instances of English slogans in travel companies’ advertisements, such as
Greece- All Time Classic (DN 5) and Hotel Village Kampen - meet nice
people… (Die Welt 21). Additionally, commonalities between the three
newspapers in the category of English slogans and phrases include ‘luxury’
products, such as watches, e.g. Chopard - Happy Sport Collection (Die Welt 2),
Royal Steel Classic - Silent Elegance (DN 31) and fine furniture:
DivanoLounge - When Outdoor Meets Indoor (HS 5).
5.2.3 Technical terms
It is hardly surprising that the advertisements in the newspapers include English
elements used as technical terms. The technical terms are presented in the
following Tables 8, 9, and 10. Of the 119 advertisements with anglicisms in Die
Welt, 22 include technical terms, i.e. 18%. The occurrences of anglicisms in Die
Welt in this category are presented in Table 8 below.

The majority of the technical terms in Table 8 above are integrated loanwords as
there are 24 integrated and only three words foreign to German in Table 8. App,
Internet, and online are clearly integrated anglicisms. App is according to
Duden (2021) the short form of the English word application, which is
Applikation in German. English is also the origin of the German word Internet
according to this dictionary. Other integrated anglicisms into German include
Edition, Code, Newsletter, Podcast, Service-Center, Sound, Display, Leasing,
Hotline and Software. The anglicisms Card, Multitouch and Phone are not
integrated loanwords in German.
Technical terms are found in 18 of the total of 59 advertisements
with anglicisms in DN. That makes for 31 %. Some of them appear in car
advertisements and they are presented separately in Table 11. Out of the
anglicisms in Table 9, Story is an integrated loanword in Swedish. However, it

51

seems not to be established yet in the sense of a story in social media platforms,
visible for 24 hours (SAOL 2021). Bluetooth is not an integrated loanword in
Swedish. Table 9 below presents the technical terms found in DN.

DN-Story (58)
There are six advertisements including technical terms in the studied issue of
HS, i.e. 26 % of all the HS advertisements with anglicisms. Some of them appear
in the car advertisements collected in Table 11. All the technical terms found in
HS are foreign words and not integrated loanwords.

The percentages in the category of technical terms in the issues of DN and HS
are 31 % (DN) and 26% (HS). Die Welt includes English technical terms in 18
% of the advertisements. The percentages in this category are quite similar
between DN and HS newspaper issues, with Die Welt differing from the rest with
a clearly smaller percentage. Chapter 6 discusses further possible reasons for
these similarities and differences between the newspaper issues.
Many anglicisms, which belong to the categories of product and
company names and logos (category 1) and technical terms (category 3), are
found in car advertisements in the issues of DN and HS. In addition to these two
categories, the car advertisements include altogether 12 English slogans and
phrases, which were presented in Chapter 5.2.2. The issue of Die Welt does not
include any car advertisements at all. Table 11 below presents examples of the
anglicisms in car advertisements in DN and HS.

5.2.4 Internationalism, modernity and general attractiveness
English is the language of international communication (Rech 2015: 127) and it
has the status as the lingua franca of the Internet (Ștefan 2019: 137). As has been
noted before, internationalisation implies anglification (Josephson 2004: 133)
and thus the more international the globe gets, the bigger the global spread of
53

English can be expected to be. Anglicisms might be associated with “language
specific values”, as for instance internationalism, modernity and youthfulness,
by the readers of the advertisement and thus appeal to the readers (Rech 2015:
109). Additionally, anglicisms might bring associations with values such as
“education, modernity […] invention, cosmopolitanism, wealth and power”
(Onysko 2007: 321, cited in Rech 2015: 109-110).
Presumably the most interesting examples of the present study
are the advertisements that use both English and German, Swedish or Finnish
elements mixed together, which Görlach (2003: 30) calls hybrid phrases. Some
of them might be described, as Görlach (2003) puts it: “playful uses [...] used for
a certain stylistic effect” (Görlach 2003: 32). While some of these English words
might be intended as loanwords, others might merely be used for a desired effect
they may create in the reader. As has been noted earlier in Chapter 4.2, it is not
always possible to know the grade of integration of a word of English origin nor
whether it is one that has come to stay (Görlach 2003: 30).
Although adaptation is the rule, or a long-term expectation, and
most words of foreign etymology are in their fully integrated forms
recognizable only for the expert, the high prestige of the donor
language can slow down accommodation, block it entirely – or
even reverse it.
(Görlach 2003: 33)
Hybrid phrases may be used when there is an intention to create a feeling of
internationalism, modernity and attractiveness to the advertisement. Table 12
below presents examples of anglicisms that are found in phrases containing both
English and German elements in the studied issue of Die Welt. Instances of
hybrid phrases in the respective languages of DN and HS are presented in the
following Tables 13 and 14, after Die Welt. Multiple examples from each
newspaper will be discussed further after each table. Unlike some of the previous
tables, the following three tables do not always include the anglicism separated
from its context but instead the whole hybrid phrase. The anglicisms are
presented in alphabetical order. When the phrase includes more anglicisms than
one, the first anglicism in the phrase will determine its place in the table.
Anglicisms with the same core word, e.g. Infinity, Relax or Wellness are
presented together.
The studied issue of Die Welt includes 77 advertisements with
54

Sara Hänninen
anglicisms that are in the present study counted in the category of
Internationalism, modernity and general attractiveness. This makes up to 65 %
of all the advertisements with anglicisms in the issue of Die Welt. Table 12 below
presents examples of the anglicisms in this category.

Rech (2015: 131) lists several properties associated with English elements, such
as “air of expensiveness”, selectiveness, high prestige, distinctiveness as well as
giving the target groups the appeal of “elitism, sophistication and success” (Rech
2015:131).
Since cosmopolitan appeal and international orientation serve as
indicators of quality, products can be up-valued by using English
elements. […] Nevertheless, this comes at the price of authenticity as
brands become more and more exchangeable.
(Rech 2015: 128)
As well as giving an international feeling to the product, English elements in
advertisements can be seen as creating a modern image, and these two properties
of anglicisms, internationalism and modernity, are often tightly connected.
According to Onysko (2007), anglicisms are often used as “emotional tools to
create an atmosphere of modernity”, especially in the language of
advertisements (Onysko 2007: 69). Moreover, such elements in advertisements
may be considered as generally more attractive, interesting and “evoking
positive emotions” and thus anglicisms can be seen as giving the product
additional value (Rech 2015:131).
A general attractiveness of foreign languages ascribes them the
connotations of being elegant, having lifestyle, showing taste,
radiating fascination […] and seeming promising […]
56

Sara Hänninen
Effectiveness, which describes a ‘more’ of some positive attribute
(i.e. taste, sound, etc.) is the most common value that is attributed
to products through English.
(Rech 2015: 131)
The anglicism Wellness appears in the Die Welt advertisements several times as
can be seen in Table 12 and in the following examples. Wellness is the most
repeatedly occurring anglicism in the studied issue of Die Welt with 28
occurrences altogether.
Exklusive Wellnessbereiche und kulinarische Highlights (67), Natur &
Wellness zum Träumen (68), Wellness vom Feinsten (68), Winter
Wellness (32), Thermal-Wellnesslandschaft (32), Wellness & SPA
(73), Wellness- und Beautyangebote (74) (Die Welt 1.6.2019)
Interestingly, the advertisement by the company First Mallorca (54) uses the
German equivalent of the word Wellness, which is Wohlfühl. Likewise,
advertisement (94) uses this German equivalent instead of the anglicism
Wellness in the wording Spa- & Wohlfühllandschaft (92) (Ger. ‘Spa- and
Wellnesslandscape’). Advertisement (101) also chooses to speak about
Wohlfühl-behandlung instead of Wellness treatment. This means that there is a
German equivalent to the English word Wellness, however, the anglicism seems
to be popular among the German advertisers as it occurs 28 times in the studied
newspaper issue of Die Welt.
Relax is another popular anglicism in the advertisements of Die
Welt. Relax is found in many wordings and forms: Relax-Angebote (Ger.
‘offers’), Relax-Bereich (Ger. ‘area’), Relax Guide, Relax-Adressen (Ger.
‘addresses), Bike & Relax and Relaxgeschenk (Ger. ‘gift’). The German
equivalent for relax is entspannen.
Another possible example of the attractivity of English in
German advertising is the phrase found in Advertisement (100): “Ein
lukullisches Hideaway für die schönsten Seiten des Paar-Seins!” (98) (Ger.’ A
luxurious hideaway to enjoy the nicest sides of couple life’). Hideaway is clearly
an English word put into a German phrase. It is not found in Duden online
dictionary. German equivalents for Hideaway could be Refugium, Versteck or

57

Zufluchtsort. However, the advertiser might aim at a possible desired effect of
modernity or internationalism through the use of this anglicism instead of the
German equivalent.
Many of the anglicisms in Die Welt occur in hotel and other
holiday resort advertisements. Such anglicisms include the following:
Mega-Tunnelrutsche mit Infinity Jump, Elite Mountainbike Resort,
Resort-Konzept, Sky SPA, Panorama-Infinity-Pool, Treatments,
Beauty Farm, Panorama-Eventsauna, Eröffnungsspecial, Hot tub,
Highlighttouren, Fitness-, Beauty- & Massagecenter (Die Welt
1.6.2019)
Sentences such as “Die Spa-Experten widmen sich dort hochwertigen
Treatments” (85) (Ger. ‘The spa experts commit theirselves to high-quality
treatments’) might wake positive reactions in the reader. Furthermore,
anglicisms such as Treatments, Beauty Farm and Fitness-, Beauty- &
Massagecenter might be used for their possible appeal and modernity. Words
for different kinds of pools are also popular anglicisms in the advertisements in
Die Welt. The advertisements include Outdoor Sky pools, Indoor-pools,
Panorama-Infinity-Pools, and a big sunset Infinity-Pool.
Feeling is used multiple times instead of the German equivalent
Gefühl. The advertisements (69) and (55), for instance, replace the German
equivalent Gefühl with an anglicism: Südtiroler Ferienfeeling in neuen
Dimensionen –25m Sky Pool (Ger. ‘South Tyrolean holiday feeling in new
dimensions’) and Über Pfingsten ist Mallorca ein beliebtes Ziel der
Kurzurlauber, die sich ein paar Tage Sommerfeeling gönnen möchten (53) (Ger.
‘At Pentecost Mallorca is a popular destination for short vacationers who want
to treat themselves to a few days of summer feeling’). In both cases the anglicism
Feeling is combined with a German noun (Sommer, Ferien) to make a
compound word with both German and English elements. Additionally, the
English word Events (7, 12) instead of the German equivalent Veranstaltung is
an example of an anglicism that might be used for its possible international tone.
In the previous examples, some English elements might function
as attention-getters. This is a term introduced by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 591)
who suggest that attention-getters can mark sophistication. They also argue that
58

Sara Hänninen
the feel of quality in advertisements was better conveyed through English than
through German (Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 591).
In the category of internationalism, modernity and general
attractiveness, German shows many integrated words. There are 96 terms in
Table 12 that are integrated and 21 that are not. The integrated loanwords include
Beautyfarm, Treatments, Wellness, Infinity-Pool, Apartment, Action,
Destination, Elite, Event, Feeling, Highlight, Lifestyle, Premium, Prestige,
Indoor and Outdoor. The English words Charm, Hideaway, Holiday,
Masterbedrooms, Cooking, hot Tub and Sky Pool instead, are examples of
anglicisms that are not (at least yet) considered part of German lexicon.
The Swedish newspaper issue includes 11 advertisements
that have anglicisms falling into the category of Internationalism, modernity and
general attractiveness. These 11 advertisements in DN make up 19 % of all the
59 advertisements with English elements in DN. The anglicisms are presented in
Table 13 below.

In Table 13 above, six anglicisms are integrated ones, such as the nouns
workshop, city, fitness, team and route. The majority, 29 anglicisms do not
count as loanwords in Swedish. These include village, garden, food, celebration
and wonder, for instance.
The Finnish advertisements include five advertisements in this
particular category, which is 22 % of all the advertisements with anglicisms in
HS. Table 14 below presents the anglicisms.

Sara Hänninen
patjan (5) and Ultimate Luxus Tynnyrisauna (9) could also presumably be
considered as examples of the possible attractivity of English. Additionally, the
anglicisms Original and Hybrid might be used for their image-building qualities,
the latter of which seems to be an especially popular anglicism in many
languages in today’s world (cf. Chapter 5.2.5). All the anglicisms in Table 14
are foreign elements in Finnish and not integrated loanwords apart from the
adjective cool in the product name Cooltouch-patjan (Fin.’mattress’). This
means that there are 10 not integrated words and one integrated loanword in HS
in this category.
To conclude, anglicisms in this particular category account for 65
% of all the advertisements with anglicisms in the studied issue of Die Welt. The
respective percentages for DN and HS are notably smaller: 19 % (DN) and 22 %
(HS). Possible reasons behind these differences are discussed further in Chapter
6.
According to the study by Androutsopoulos et al. (2004: 22) on
German advertisement slogans, anglicisms in the word class of nouns include
both “product descriptions”

13

[SH translation] and expressions that build an

image, and these image-building anglicisms are central for the brand when it
wants to communicate “innovation, modernity and internationalism” [SH
translation] to the potential customer. Common anglicisms in the function of
product descriptions include words such has internet, music and sound, and as
image-building anglicisms could be counted, for instance, the English words
world and future (Androutsopoulos et al. 2004: 22). The material of the present
study includes both what Androutsopoulos et al. (2004) classify as product
descriptions and image-building anglicisms. As the study by Androtsoupoulos
et al. (2004), also the sample of the present study includes anglicisms that
describe products such as Internet (Die Welt 41) and Audi Sound System (DN
42). Androutsopoulos et al. (2004: 22) suggest that particularly good examples
of image-building anglicisms to create a modern, innovative and international

”Bei den Substantiven kommen sowohl Produktbezeihnungen (shoes, internet, music, sound)
als auch Image bildende Anglizismen vor (life, world, future, power). Gerade world und future
sind zentrale Schlagworte in der Kommunikation von Innovation, Modernität und
Internationalität. Damit bestätigt sich, dass der Stellenwert von Anglizismen zur ImageBildung in den letzten Jahren wichtiger geworden ist” (Androutsopoulos et al. 2004: 22).
13

61

image are the anglicisms world and future, which are also found in the issues of
Die Welt and DN: Ökoworld (Die Welt 4) and En Future Food City (DN 33).
As has previously been seen from the results presented earlier in
this chapter, travelling is a popular field for anglicisms to occur and tourism
vocabulary has been shown to be a field that presents an increase in anglicisms
(Giménez Folqués 2015: 153). As discussed in Chapter 3.4, hotel companies
have been shown to take advantage of the “internationalization of English”
(Giménez Folqués 2015: 150). The chosen issue of Die Welt includes, as
previously mentioned, several travel-related anglicisms that occur in the
advertisements of both travel companies and hotels. Examples of anglicisms
occurring more than once in the material include Resort and Spa as well as
different combinations of the anglicisms Relax and Wellness with German
words, such as Relax- and Wellnessbereich (Ger.area). Additionally, travelrelated anglicisms are found in the DN advertisements by travel companies: All
Inclusive! (5), Epiphany (5), Garden Route (39). Another commonality
between the issues of Die Welt and DN is the anglicism Fitness (Die Welt 39,
DN 57).
5.2.5 Filling word gaps
The world is ever-changing, and as new technical innovations emerge, new
words are constantly introduced in other languages that do not (yet) have native
equivalents to these words. Particularly often this means technical terms that
function as filling lexical gaps (Rech 2015: 119). In the slogans that are for the
most part in German but include anglicisms, the function of the English
loanword is often to fill “gaping holes in the contemporary German vocabulary”
(Leibniz 2008). Table 15 below presents examples of anglicisms that can be seen
functioning as filling lexical gaps in the German, Swedish and Finnish
vocabulary.

Die Welt and DN share the technical term Leasing, which seems to fill a word
gap in both the German and Swedish vocabulary. Additionally, online is an
example of an English technical term, which is widely used in German everyday
language (Rech 2015: 128), and this particular anglicism is found in four
advertisements of the studied issue of Die Welt. Other technical terms occurring
in the material of the present study include words such as App (Die Welt 26),
Podcast (Die Welt 3), Story (DN 58) (one in social media feed, often lasting for
24 hours), and Software (Die Welt 51). Hybrid is an anglicism found in a Finnish
advertisement used in the construction Hybrid-tunteella (Fin. ‘with a Hybrid
feeling’). This particular English word is not an integrated loanword in Finnish
in its fully English form, but instead, in the form of hybridi (Kielitoimiston
sanakirja 2021). The anglicism hybrid is also found in DN in a product name of
a car advertisement: Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-In Hybrid (44, 45). ReTaste
(33) is an example of a term not established in Swedish and thus filling a word
gap as it refers to a new undertaking to improve the recycling of food and
reducing food waste. The percentages of advertisements including lexical gaps
are relatively similar in Die Welt (11 %) and HS (13%), whereas DN differs from
the rest with a higher percentage as it presents lexical items in 20 % of its
advertisements with anglicisms.

63

The question of how anglicisms are understood by the readers of
advertisements in countries where English is not an official language is a
common one. According to Hietaranta (2008), however, the readers’
comprehension of the advertisements’ contents might even be eased with the use
of anglicisms, in case the anglicisms in advertisements are ICT (Information and
Communications Technology) elements that already have established meanings,
which readers with “an even modest command of English” can recognize
(Hietaranta 2008: 136). An advertisement with the core text in Finnish
augmented by a few anglicisms that also are used in other domains than ICT is
a secure way of assuring that the advertisement is understood by the readers
(Hietaranta 2008: 136).
The comprehension of the ad is obviously not without economic
significance: if consumers need to engage in an explicit processing effort
to make sense of an advertisement, they will lose their interest in the
product due to the unreasonable processing requirements of the text. […]
However, by using a text […] in which the Finnish core text is
supplemented by a few anglicisms, which are again used outside the
sphere of ICT texts, one can ensure that the text can be processed in its
entirety quite smoothly and that the economic goal in question (i.e.
readers’ decision to purchase the product) is likely to be achieved.
(Hietaranta 2008: 136)

The items filling lexical gaps in the advertisements in DN include ICT elements
such as Bluetooth (46, 55), which in today’s world presumably is understandable
to a reader even with basic technological skills. Additionally, Die Welt
advertisements include widely spread and thus presumably relatively easily
understandable technical terms such as online (20), Code (40) and Internet (41).
When it comes to anglicisms that fill word gaps, the use of English
is required, as there often are no equivalents for the English terms in other
languages, at least not directly when a term is introduced, and maybe not later
either if the English word is found suitable in the recipient language. Leasing,
Hybrid, Podcast and online are words that might presumably not need
translations, but instead easily become integrated loanwords in languages other
than English as well. In the case of word gaps, the advertiser does not have a
choice to make between English and the native language as there are no

64

Sara Hänninen
equivalents. Advertisers do not have a choice either when it comes to
international product and company names, or logos. Where advertisers do have
a choice, however, are in the case of slogans mostly in the native language of the
country where the advertisement appears, with some English elements. Many
anglicisms in such slogans are found in category 4: Internationalism, modernity
and general attractiveness. The anglicism Treatments, for example, which is
used instead of the German word Behandlungen in the phrase Die Spa-Experten
widmen sich dort hochwertigen Treatments (Die Welt 85) (Ger. ‘The spa experts
commit theirselves to high-quality treatments’) seems like a clear case of the
advertiser selecting an English word instead of the corresponding native word.
Additionally, an example where the advertisers seem to choose English is in the
word choice of BBQ instead of the Swedish equivalent grill fest in the slogan
Koreansk BBQ hemma hos dig i sommar? (Swe. ‘How about some Korean
barbecue at your place this summer?’) (DN 34). Finnish advertisements,
likewise, show cases of optional, but preferred use of English by the advertisers:
Ultimate Luxus Tynnyrisauna (9) (Fin. ‘Ultimate luxury barrelsauna’), where the
anglicism ultimate is used instead of the Finnish equivalent word, äärimmäinen.

6. Discussion and Conclusion
We encounter advertising daily and the advertisements that we come across
include English elements in many European countries with other national
languages. The world is increasingly globalised, and English is the language of
global advertising. English is “a ‘cool’ language to attract attention” (Bhatia &
Ritchie 2013: 594) but that is most certainly not the only reason to include
English in advertisements. Reasons for the use of English can be, for instance,
that English words fill word gaps, and this occurs often when it comes to new
technical terms that are in English and have no equivalents in other languages.
The aim of this study was to find out how English elements are
used in newspaper advertising in Germany, Sweden and Finland, and also to
analyse the similarities and differences between these three European languages.
To find this out, three national daily print newspapers with high circulations in
each country were chosen. The material of the present study comes from three

65

newspaper issues altogether, one from each country. The findings of the study
suggest that common categories in which anglicisms appear in all the three
newspaper issues are the following:
1) Product name, company name and logo
2) Slogans and phrases only in English
3) Technical terms
4) Internationalism, modernity and general attractiveness
5) Filling word gaps
The most prominent category both in the issue of the Swedish newspaper Dagens
Nyheter and Finnish Helsingin Sanomat is category 1: Product name, company
name and logo. Out of all the advertisements with anglicisms in DN, 85 %
include product and company names and/or logos. The respective percentage of
HS is 78 %. In the German Die Welt newspaper issue, on the other hand, the
advertisements with anglicisms belonging to this particular category make up 25
%. As previously mentioned in Chapter 3.3, the domain of product names was
proposed by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) in their structural hierarchy model to be
the easiest structural domain of an advertisement for English to enter, depicted
by the scholars as the ‘first step in the staircase’ (see Figure 1). The domain of
company name and logo is according to this model the next domain that ‘opens
up’ to English when the first step of product names is ‘conquered’. The fact that
both the DN and HS newspaper issues show high percentages in the category of
product name, company name and logo suggest that English has conquered in
these languages at least the first two steps of the ‘staircase’ proposed by Bhatia
and Ritchie (2013). The big percentages in this particular category in DN and HS
might perhaps imply that many of the advertisements in DN and HS might still
be on the second ‘step’ of the ‘staircase’, which could mean that they still are
more ‘closed’, i.e. resistant to English in the other structural domains higher in
Bhatia and Ritchie’s (2013) proposed structural hierarchy model.
The second category, Slogans and phrases only in English also
shows differences between the studied newspaper issues, albeit smaller. The
percentages in the Swedish and German newspapers are 27 % for DN and 29 %
for Die Welt. They are both higher than the percentage of HS, which is 17 %.
The domain of slogans holds according to Bhatia and Ritchie’s (2013) structural
hierarchy model the second highest of the ‘steps’ of the staircase model on the

66

Sara Hänninen
different structural domains of advertisements. The fact that Die Welt and DN
display higher percentages than HS in this domain could perhaps be an indication
of these two newspaper issues including English elements in more of the
different structural domains of their advertisements than HS, as slogans are
positioned high in the hierarchy proposed by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013). As
discussed earlier in Chapter 3.3, Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) suggest that if English
has conquered the ‘step’ of slogans, the steps underneath it have already become
open to English (2013: 581). As almost a third of the advertisements of both Die
Welt and DN include English slogans, one might according to this model
possibly suggest that more structural domains of an advertisement are open to
English in Die Welt and DN than in HS.
Another category that shows clear differences between the
languages is category 4: Internationalism, modernity and general attractiveness.
In this particular category, both DN and HS present relatively similar
percentages: 19 % (DN) and 22% (HS). In contrast, this category accounts for
the majority of the anglicisms found in the sample of advertisements in Die Welt,
namely 65 % of the advertisements with anglicisms in this newspaper issue. The
reasons for the high percentage in this particular category in Die Welt might be
historical. German language seems to have a long history of preferring English
in advertisements, dating back at least to the 1960s (Römer 1968: 125). As
mentioned previously in Chapter 3.2, Die Welt newspaper put forward already
in 1960 that English words should be preferred over German ones in perfume
advertisements, for instance. This Die Welt article that dates back 60 years in
time reveals us that Germans have had positive attitudes towards English in the
field of advertising language for a long time. These positive views on anglicisms
in Europe haven’t diminished since, on the contrary, national dictionaries of
several European languages were reported ‘flooded’ by English imports in the
beginning of the current century (Görlach 2003: 30). How Britain’s exit from
the European Union affects the anglicism situation in Europe is a potential topic
for future studies.
The two remaining categories, namely category 3: Technical terms
and 5: Filling word gaps don’t show such big differences between the
newspapers as the above discussed categories 1 and 4. When it comes to
technical terms the percentages in the issues of DN and HS are 31 % (DN) and
67

26% (HS). Die Welt differs from the two former ones as only 18 % of its
advertisements include English technical terms. One reason for this difference is
that the studied issue of Die Welt doesn’t include any car advertisements, which
commonly include many technical terms in English. The issues of DN and HS,
on the contrary, both include several car advertisements with many technical
terms in English (See Table 11).
Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 591) see anglicisms as bringing special
effects and “creative meanings” to advertisements (2013: 591). As Görlach
(2003: 30) puts it, English words often simply sound ‘better’ than their German
equivalents (Görlach 2003: 30). Through a look at the results, light might be
shed on the reasons behind the ‘betterness’ of English suggested by Görlach
(2003). The results of the present study will be discussed in terms of the
framework of features proposed by Bhatia and Ritchie presented in Figure 2
(repeated here for convenience).

Figure 4: English: socio-psychological features
(adapted from Bhatia & Ritchie 2013: 589)

Out of the threshold features discussed by Bhatia and Ritchie (2013: 589), the
features of future and innovation are relevant when it comes to English technical
68

Sara Hänninen
terms found in the German, Swedish and Finnish advertising language. The
English technical terms might signal “advancement and betterment” according
to Bhatia and Ritchie’s (2013) categories. Earlier mentioned examples in the
newspaper issues include Multitouch Display and Der Wirtschaftspodcast (Die
Welt 30, 3), Apple Car Play and DN-Story (DN 51, 58) and Android-kokemus
(Fin. ‘experience’) or Hybrid-tunteella (Fin. ‘feeling’) (HS 1, 5).
Anglicisms such as Grand (DN 18) and Noble (DN 21, 24) in the
Swedish advertisements might for their part signal sophistication, another
feature in Bhatia and Ritchie’s model, which they see meaning that “elegance,
style and rarity” (2013: 589) is what is aimed at with the use of English. Wellness
(i.a. 34), Hideaway (98), Treatments (80, 85, 97) and Resort (39, 40, 74, 76), all
found in Die Welt could also be interpreted as examples of this very
phenomenon. Anglicisms found in the HS advertisements also contribute to this
possible feature of sophistication in anglicisms, as, for instance the ones
presented in the following: Ultimate Luxus Tynnyrisauna (9) and Supreme
Cooltouch-patjan (Fin. ‘mattress’) (5).
The feature of internationalism and standardisation, which Bhatia
& Ritchie (2013) suggest including “certification and authenticity” can also be
observed in the anglicisms of the material of the study. English is commonly
found in the company names and product names in the advertisements of Die
Welt, DN and HS. Examples of such international company names include
Global Investors, TUI Cruises (Die Welt 4, 29) and Honest Organic (DN 37).
The advertisers might possibly aim at a feeling of authenticity through the use
of English in these cases. English is also found in company names in the Finnish
advertisements, such as Finnair Holidays-matkat and Rajala Pro Shop (HS 8,
7). The latter, Rajala Pro Shop (HS 7), however, is not an international company
but instead a local one operating only in Finland. Here the use of English might
be motivated by the company’s desire to sound as a bigger and more
international company. However, the use of English in this specific example
cannot be seen suggesting “certification and authenticity”, as the company in
truth is a local one and thus their internationalism is not authentic. As discussed
earlier, all the languages of investigation also include anglicisms in product
names: Groundpiece Anbausofa and Rolex – Oyster Perpetual Sky-Dweller (Die

69

Welt 106, 119), True Match produkter and Rovos Rail (DN 14, 39) and iGrill 3
and Tempur Original-tyynyt (HS 2, 5).
Additionally, as discussed in Chapter 3.4, English is the dominant
transmitter of global cultural discourse which can be seen, for instance, in the
American films, television and music that have spread worldwide. Instances of
American and British cultural discourse are found in the advertisements of the
present study, for example in many English film names in the DN newspaper
issue, such as Child’s Play (DN 23), Green Book (DN 18, 26) and Rocketman
(DN 18, 24, 25, 26, 38). However, as Androtsoupoulus et al. (2004: 23) point
out, the reason for anglicisms in advertising is not merely to display the AngloAmerican culture but they are used due to the “international code with a
multifunctional character”

14

[SH translation] which English possesses.

Whether or not advertisers have a choice to make between English
and the native language of the country where the advertisement is presented
varies. When it comes to product and company names, there is often no
possibility for advertisers to choose whether they use English or the native
language. Product names such as Apple Car Play (DN 51), Nya Corolla Active
1,2 Turbo (DN 50) or Nya Mini Cooper Essential Edition (DN 56) are available
for the advertisers only in English. Where advertisers do have a choice to make
between the native language of the country and English is for example in the
anglicism in the car advertisement for Citroën C3 Feel (DN 47), where the
anglicism Feel might have been introduced to create positive feelings in the
reader. Wellness, which was discussed in more detail above, is another example
of an anglicism that may be used for the possible modern and attractive image it
might create in the recipient.
The discussion above includes interpretations of the writer of the
thesis based on the framework of Bhatia and Ritchie (2013) on threshold
features. It is one way of interpreting the material of the present study, i.e. the
anglicisms that were found. Moreover, it is worth noting that it may not always

”Der geringe Anteil deutscher Slogans mit lexikalischen Anglizismen bestätigt die These, dass
es bei den Slogans um Sprachwahl und nicht um Sprachmischung geht. Freilich kann durch einen
englishen Slogan in einer sonst deutschsprachigen Anzeige Sprachmischung zustande kommen,
doch im Slogan selbst spielt Sprachmischung eine geringe Rolle. […] In diesem Sinne ist English
im Werbeslogan kein angloamerikanischer, sondern ein internationaler Code mit
Mehrzweckcharackter” (Androutsopoulos et al. 2004: 23).
14

70

Sara Hänninen
be evident even to the person producing the text in the advertisement whether
the English word is meant as a loan or only used for some desired effect and
consequently it is impossible for a researcher to know.
It is to be anticipated that the use of English, or ‘Englishes’
(Anderman & Rogers 2005: vii) continues growing in the future. Görlach (2003:
33) predicted in 2003 how the future of English elements in European languages
was likely to look like. He predicted the use of English to be more frequent in
all European countries and the English language proficiency of the Europeans to
grow (Görlach 2003: 33). This, however, does not necessarily mean that English
would be threatening other languages even though many have been concerned
about it. Görlach (2003), among others, has described how the French feel
threatened with the influx of new English lexicon: “the concern of the French
[…] of being anglified by fashionable lexical imports” (Görlach 2003: 34). A
similar concern has been expressed for the Swedish language, that English
loanwords would gradually “eat up” [SH translation] the Swedish language
(Josephson 2004: 73). However, Josephson (2004: 73) sees the disapproval
towards anglicisms unnecessary, as lexical loans, regardless of their origin, give
the speakers “new resources” [SH translation] to express themselves (sv.
uttrycksresurser) and they should thus be welcomed to the language (Josephson
2004: 73). Görlach (2003) likewise takes a critical approach to the “alleged
corruption of European languages by English loanwords”, as he calls it (Görlach
2003: 35). He grounds his opinion on two points:
1) Latin and French loanwords in German still are four times as
common as are English ones and this situation is suggested to be
similar in other European languages.
2) Many English elements may not be, as what Görlach calls,
permanent guests, but instead more short-lived words that
disappear after a while from the vocabulary of a certain language.
(Görlach 2003: 35)

This means that English words in other languages are not always “permanent
guests” and dictionaries will help in determining whether an anglicism is a longlived loanword or not (Görlach 2003: 35).

71

Out of the three languages of investigation, German shows most
eagerness to integrate English words into its lexicon. The adjective royal, for
instance, is found in both the issues of DN and Die Welt. In German, this
adjective is already seen as part of the lexicon of the recipient language, whereas
for Swedish, this adjective is not considered a Swedish word. Like Swedish, also
Finnish seems more resistant towards English when it comes to integrating
English words into the Finnish lexicon. A few examples follow that explain this
point.
The anglicism Beauty is a German word, but not an integrated
loanword in Swedish nor Finnish. Clever is an adjective that Swedish and
Finnish still see as a foreign word, whereas in German it is an integrated
loanword. Outdoor is an anglicism found in all the three newspaper issues, but
it is an integrated loanword only in German. Additionally, according to the
dictionaries Duden and SAOL, Bluetooth is considered German, but not Swedish
nor Finnish.
Out of the features of English in advertisements proposed by
Bhatia and Ritchie (2013), one surely prominent and true reason for using
English words is the international flare of English. English is an international
language which carries Anglo-American culture which is strongly associated
with entertainment and leisure time, which evoke positive emotions in readers.
One of the anglicisms of the study found in DN, MOOD Stockholm, for instance,
is a shopping centre in the capital, opened in 2012, which strives for an
international feeling not only by the English name MOOD but also in signs and
shop windows inside the shopping centre (Lindblom et al. 2013: 10). Likewise,
the Finnish shopping centre Mall of Tripla, which opened in 2019, relies on
English not only in the name of the centre, but also in signs inside the centre and
in the names of the floors (Rantavaara 2019). What is common for both MOOD
Stockholm and Mall of Tripla is that they both seemingly strive for an
international image with the use of English names and these word choices have
faced criticism in both countries (Rantavaara 2019).
To conclude, the findings of the present cross-linguistic
comparative study suggest that the European reader of big quality newspapers
encounters English elements in newspaper advertising in the countries of
Germany, Sweden and Finland. However, the material of the present study was
72

Sara Hänninen
limited to one issue for each language in order to enable a closer qualitative
analysis of the different uses of the anglicisms and thus a bigger material would
be needed to draw more conclusions on the quantitative aspects of anglicisms,
i.e. the numerical anglicism situation in the field of advertising language in 2019.
There is more to the use of English in the advertising language in Germany,
Sweden and Finland than that an English word simply sounds ‘better’ than the
native equivalents, as Görlach (2003: 30) suggests. Surely, many times
advertisers have the choice to make between the native language and English
and then the ‘better’ sounding of English might often come to question, but this
is certainly not always the case. Product and company names of international
companies are often in English, as for instance First Mallorca (Die Welt 52, 54),
Santander Consumer Bank (DN 3) and Smart House Collection (HS 5), and in
these cases the advertisers do not have a choice on whether to use English or the
native language, i.e. English dominates. However, there are various instances
where advertisers do have the choice to make between the native language and
English. This is the case in slogans, for instance, where, in the present study,
English was shown to be used as a stylistic device and thus rather optional than
obligatory for the advertiser. Additionally, where advertisers have the choice is
when the use of English is motivated by the internationalism and modernity that
it may bring to the advertisement. The use of the anglicism Wellness, in Die
Welt, is a good example of such an anglicism. Its German equivalent, Wohlfühl,
was found in Die Welt advertisements as well. The motivation for the use of
English might be the international and modern image that English has by many
scholars suggested to have in advertising. Anglicisms might also function as
attention-getters as well as mediate elegance, style, or a scientific appeal (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 591, 589).
All in all, the present study is an investigation of the use of
anglicisms in three European countries in mid-2019. Our globe is more
international than ever, and getting continuously more so, and further studies are
certainly needed to examine the development of this ever-evolving phenomenon
within the field of language contact. Studies on how anglicisms are
comprehended by the European readers as well as what kinds of associations
English words awake in readers are certainly potential topics to investigate in
the future. Furthermore, English elements in the Swedish language newspapers
73

in Finland would be interesting to study as well as how the global pandemic,
Covid-19, affected the field of advertising and its ever-evolving anglicismsituation.

Swedish Summary - Svensk sammanfattning
Användningen av anglicismer i det tyska, svenska och finska
reklamspråket
Inledning och syfte
I dagens samhälle spelar det engelska språket en allt större roll. Engelskan
används idag runtom i världen som ett lingua franca och det är det mest spridda
språket i mänsklighetens historia. Engelska används flitigt till exempel på
webben, i ungdomsspråk och fackspråk över hela världen och språket har en
stark ställning inom speciell terminologi för olika vetenskapliga områden såsom
ekonomi och medicin. Dessutom har engelskan ett stort inflytande på
reklamspråk, och det inflytandet ökar kontinuerligt. Det är intressant att studera
annonser i europeiska länder där engelska inte är ett officiellt språk, såsom i
Tyskland, Sverige och Finland för att kunna se hur mycket detta globala
världsspråk påverkar andra språk. Denna avhandling är en tvärspråklig
jämförande undersökning av anglicismer i tryckta tidningsreklamer med
följande forskningsfrågor:
1) Hur används anglicismer i tysk-, svensk- och finskspråkiga tryckta
tidningsreklamer?
2) Vilka skillnader och likheter finns det mellan dessa tre språk i användingen
av anglicismer i tidningsreklamer?
Bakgrund
Marknadsföring och reklam spelar en stor roll när det gäller vad kunderna väljer
att köpa. Kännetecknande för reklamspråk är att det utnyttjar både vardagligt
språk, ungdomsspråk, tekniskt språk, och dialekter (Rech 2015: 71). Världen är
alltmer globaliserad och engelskan syns i reklamspråk i andra länder i växande
grad. Engelskan ses som ett ”coolt” språk som väcker uppmärksamhet (Bhatia
& Ritchie 2013: 594) men det är inte den enda orsaken för engelskans
användning i reklamspråk i länder där engelska inte är ett officiellt språk. Bhatia
och Ritchie (2013) delar reklamer i olika ”domäner” (eng. ’domains of an
advertisement’) som innehåller bl.a. produktnamn, företagsnamn och logo samt

75

sloganer. Kategorierna för anglicismer som används i denna avhandling
skapades baserat på Rechs (2015) och Bhatias och Ritchies (2013) ramverk och
presenteras under Resultat.
Engelska ord är ofta intagna i andra språk i form av anglicismer.
Enligt Onysko (2007) är begreppet anglicism en övergripande term för att
beskriva förekomsten av engelska element i andra språk (Onysko 2007: 10).
Anglicismer är vanliga i det vardagliga tyska språket och i dag kan man knappast
undvika att konfronteras av engelska i Tyskland (Erkenbrecher 2006: 3).
Anglicismer i det svenska och finska språket har också konstaterats förekomma
allt oftare under den senaste tiden (Lindblom et al. 2013, Hiltunen 2015). Även
om engelska inte har någon officiell status i de flesta europeiska länder, som till
exempel i Tyskland, Sverige och Finland, används engelska alltmer som ett
språk för kommunikation i många olika sammanhang (Cenoz & Jessner 2000:
viii).
Metoder och material
I analysen användes tre tidningsnummer, Die Welt, Dagens Nyheter (DN) och
Helsingin Sanomat (HS), ett nummer per tidning. Alla dessa tre tidningar, Die
Welt, DN och HS utkommer dagligen och hör till de tre största
kvalitetstidningarna i respektive land när det gäller spridning (Ojala et.al. 2017:
478). Samtliga tidningsnummer publicerades den 1 juni 2019. Tidningsnumren
studerades noggrant och alla reklamer som innehåller engelska ord och uttryck
valdes ut. Materialet omfattar sammanlagt 201 reklamer. I undersökningen
inkluderades endast reklamer med anglicismer och några av reklamerna bidrog
med fler anglicismer än de andra. Några av anglicismerna är redan integrerade
lånord i språken ifråga och andra är inte det. Huruvida de engelska elementen
redan är delar av det tyska, svenska, eller finska språkets vokabulär avgjordes
med hjälp av de tre digitala ordböckerna: den tyska ordboken Duden, den
svenska Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL) samt den finska ordboken
Kielitoimiston sanakirja.
Undersökningen innehåller både en kvantitativ och en kvalitativ
analys. Den kvantitativa analysen strävar efter att kartlägga och jämföra i vilken
grad element från engelska förekommer i tysk-, svensk och finskspråkiga
tidningsreklamer. Den kvalitativa analysen innehåller en diskussion om olika
76

Sara Hänninen
användningar (eng. ’uses’) av engelska element i reklamerna samt en diskussion
om i vilken grad dessa element från engelska har redan blivit lånord i de
studerade språken.
Resultat
Den kvantitativa undersökningen tyder på att majoriteten av tidningsreklamerna
innehåller anglicismer. De lila stolparna i diagrammen föreställer reklamer med
anglicismer och de ljusröda stolpar reklamer utan anglicismer.

Reklamer utan anglicismer

Figur 1. Reklamer med och utan anglicismer i sampel av tidningsnummer
av Die Welt, Dagens Nyheter och Helsingin Sanomat
Figur 1 visar en liknande trend i alla tre tidningar och tyder möjligen på att
engelska element är vanliga i tyskt, svenskt och finskt reklamspråk. Man skulle
dock behöva ett större sampel av tidningsnummer för att kunna dra mera
slutsatser om förekomsten av anglicismer i reklamspråk. Utöver den kvantitativa
analysen som ger oss insikten om mängden av anglicismer i reklamerna,
innehåller denna undersökning också en kvalitativ analys som tar närmare reda
på hur anglicismer används i tidningsreklamer i de tre undersökta
tidningsnummer. I den kvalitativa analysen används Bhatias och Ritchies (2013)
samt Rechs (2015) teoretiska ramverk för att kategorisera och klassificera
anglicismerna i reklamerna. Reklamerna kategoriserades enligt anglicismernas

77

innehåll, (eng. ’content’) (kategorierna 1, 2 och 3) samt motivering (eng.
’motivation’) för användningen av engelska element (kategorierna 4 och 5).
1) produktnamn, företagsnamn eller logo
2) sloganer helt och hållet på engelska
3) tekniska termer
4) anglicismer som skapar en modern och internationell image
5) anglicismer som fyller ordluckor
I den första kategorin, produktnamn, företagsnamn eller logo, var de
procentuella andelarna av reklamer med anglicismer i produktnamn,
företagsnamn eller logo i DN och HS liknande: av alla DN reklamer med
anglicismer, innehåller 85 % anglicismer inom denna kategori och den
respektive siffran för HS var 75 %. Die Welt däremot framvisade anglicismer
inom denna kategori endast i 26 % av alla dess reklamer med anglicismer.
I den andra kategorin, engelska sloganer, var de procentuella
andelarna av reklamer med engelska sloganer relativt liknande i alla tre
tidningsnummer, DN med 27 %, HS med 17 % och Die Welt med 29 %. De
procentuella andelarna av reklamer som innehåller tekniska termer, i den tredje
kategorin, var också lika: hos DN 30 %, hos HS 25 % och hos Die Welt 18 %.
Den fjärde kategorin, anglicismer som skapar en modern och internationell
image, var speciellt starkt representerad i den tyskspråkiga kontexten. Av alla
reklamer med anglicismer i Die Welt, innehåller tillochmed 64 % anglicismer
som kan räknas höra till denna kategori. De respektive procentuella andelarna
av reklamer inom denna kategori hos DN och HS var markant mindre: 18 %
(DN) och 25 % (HS).
Vi lever i en ständigt föränderlig värld och nya innovationer och
teknik dyker upp jämt. Detta betyder att nya termer som ofta är på engelska, är
introducerade genom reklamerna i länder där engelska inte är ett officiellt språk.
Marknadsföring spelar en stor roll i den globala spridningen av nya engelska
termer. Dessa termer har ofta inte hunnit få motsvarigheter i tyska, svenska eller
finska och då är det frågan om anglicismer som fyller ordluckor. Exempel på
sådana anglicismer är online, Software, Leasing och Hotline som alla
förekommer i utgåvan av Die Welt. I det studerade numret av DN hittas det bl.a.
story (en i sociala medier, som vanligen försvinner efter 24 timmar) och
78

Sara Hänninen
workshop. I tidningen HS hittar vi anglicismen outlet som används för att fylla
en ordlucka i det finska språket. Leasing är en gemensam anglicism för Die Welt
och DN, och hybrid är en anglicism som förekommer både i DN och HS.
Motiveringar för användingen av anglicismer kan vara deras
imageskapande egenskaper samt som nämnt ovan, att de fyller ordluckor. Tyska
språket förefaller integrera engelska ord mest ivrigt. Ord som wellness,
highlight, feeling, lifestyle, outdoor, beauty, clever och royal, till exempel, är
integrerade lånord från engelskan i det tyska språket, men inte än en del av den
svenska eller finska vokabulären.
Diskussion och sammanfattning
I denna avhandling undersöktes användningen av anglicismer i tysk-, svenskoch finskspråkiga tryckta reklamer. Utifrån resultaten i den kvantitativa analysen
kan man dra slutsatsen att användningen av engelska ord och uttryck i reklamer
i de undersökta länderna verkar vara vanligt; majoriteten av reklamerna hos alla
tre tidningsnummer innehöll anglicismer. Tidningen med den största
procentuella andelen anglicismer i reklamerna är Dagens Nyheter, med 70 %,
varpå följer Die Welt med 60 % och Helsingin Sanomat med 55 %.
I den kvalitativa analysen användes Bhatias och Ritchie’s ramverk
för anglicismer i reklamspråk samt Rechs (2015) ramverk för anglicismer.
Resultat i den kvalitativa analysen tyder på att engelska används i
tidningsreklamer i produkt-och företagsnamn, sloganer och tekniska termer.
Reklamerna räknades enligt anglicismernas innehåll och motivering och
procentuella andelar av reklamer med de olika slags anglicismer jämfördes.
Några av kategorierna ser lika ut i alla tre tidningar. I den andra kategorin,
sloganer på engelska samt den tredje kategorin, tekniska termer har alla tre
tidningar liknande procentuella andelar av reklamer inom dessa kategorier.
Däremot i kategorin 4, i den tyskaspråkiga kontexten (Die Welt) förekommer
reklamer med anglicismer som har motiveringen internationalism och
modernitet mer frekvent än i de två respektive tidningar DN och HS. Det är 64
% av alla reklamer med anglicismer som innehåller anglicismer inom denna
kategori, medan de respektive procentandelarna i DN är 18 % och i HS är 25 %.
En annan kategori som skiljer tidningarna åt är kategorin produktnamn,
företagsnamn och logo, där både DN och HS har liknande siffror: 85 % (DN)
79

och 75 % (HS) medan Die Welt visar anglicismer i 26 % av reklamerna.
Engelskan i reklamerna framkallar specialeffekter och kreativa
betydelser (‘creative meanings’) (Bhatia och Ritchie 2013: 591). Engelskan helt
enkelt låter bättre (Görlach 2003: 30), och orsaker bakom detta kommer att
klargöras i följande med hjälp av Bhatias och Ritchies ramverk (2013: 589). (se
tabell 2). Vanliga egenskaper som Bhatia och Ritchie (2013) föreslår att engelska
besitter är känslan av framtid och innovation, internationalism och sofistikation.
Många tekniska termer kan tolkas att ingå i kategorin framtid och innovation.
Ord som Podcast (Die Welt 3), DN-Story (DN 58) och Hybrid (HS 1,5) är
exempel på tekniska termer som kunde ses signalera avancemang. Egenskapen
av internationalism kan ses till exempel i produktnamn som marknadsför resor,
TUI Cruises (Die Welt 29) och Finnair Holidays-matkat (HS 8) .
Enligt Bhatias och Ritchies (2013) modell, i reklamer där engelska
används för att åstadkomma ändamålet sofistikation, strävas det med engelska
element till elegans, stil och raritet. Exempel på sådana anglicismer kunde
uppfattas i Welt-tidningsnumret, exempelvis anglicismerna Wellness (bl.a. 34),
Hideaway (99), Treatments (81, 86, 98) och Resort (40, 41, 75, 77). Ord som
ultimate (9) och supreme (5) i HS kunde likaledes ses som exempel på detta.
Reklamspråk förändras kontinuerligt och annonsörer strävar efter
ett innovativt språkbruk i reklamerna (Rech 2015: 71). Engelskans inflytande på
europeiska språk ökar kontinuerligt och bruket av anglicismer syns stydligt i
reklamspråk. Detta är ett påtagligt fenomen. En orsak till användningen av
anglicismer är att engelskan verkar ge en känsla av aktualitet och framåtanda till
andra språk, i synnerhet i tekniska termer i reklamerna. Engelskans dominans är
en aktuell fråga och denna undersökning reflekterar (anglicism)situationen i juni
2019. Det skulle vara intressant att utföra en kvantitativ undersökning om hur
många anglicismer tysk-, svensk- och finskspråkiga tryckta reklamer innehåller
till exempel under en period på 10 eller 20 år. Dessutom skulle det vara intressant
att undersöka vilka attityder till anglicismer i reklamspråket det finns samt till
vilken grad läsarna förstår de engelska elementen i reklamerna.
