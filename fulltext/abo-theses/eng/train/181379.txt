Supevisor:
The exclusion of women’s experiences from the refugee discourse is inherent in the 1951
Convention refugee definition. As the language itself does not speak of gender there has been
unnecessary conceptual barriers to women’s claims. However, today, seventy years after
establishing the 1951 Convention it is generally accepted that the Convention refugee
definition as a whole should be interpreted with an awareness of possible gender dimensions
and that it is essential to define and distinguish between the terms “gender” and “sex”. The
evolution of the notion of gender-related violence has had a positive impact on breaking the
barriers to women’s gender-related asylum claims. It has been recognised that gender (rather
than sex) may have an impact in the form of persecution, while the reasons for persecution
may arise from the construction of gender in the society.
This thesis provides a gender-sensitive overview of the existing refugee discourse and
examines the barriers to women’s claims for asylum under the 1951 Convention and its 1967
Protocol grounds “particular social group” and “political opinion”. Furthermore, it examines
scholarly writings and interpretative guidelines to find answers to the question of, whether
women’s claims for asylum will be better incorporated to the refugee discourse by adopting
gender-sensitive interpretation or by adding “gender” as independent ground to the
Convention. In doing so, it has analysed the 1951 Convention refugee definition elements that
have deemed most problematic in gender-related cases: definition and understanding of the
term “persecution”, non-state actors of persecution, and “nexus” between persecution and one
of the enumerated Convention grounds. Furthermore, the thesis assesses a trilogy of cases
from common law countries that have contributed to the evolutionary reading of the refugee
definition for better inclusion of women’s gender-related claims to the discourse.
The drafters of the 1951 Convention left the indispensable element of flexibility on the
concept of persecution on purpose to ensure that it can be applied to circumstances as they
might arise. The indeterminacy has allowed the concept to evolve to the “changing nature of
persecution” and include forms of harm, that may not have been relevant to the drafters 70
years ago, such as FGM or domestic violence.
Were gender to be added as a sixth enumerated ground, there would still be a need to
adjudicate women’s claims to refugee on a case-by-case basis, in order to ensure their
protection under international law. Adding gender as a sixth enumerated ground could,
however, provide a platform for women’s experiences of persecution in the refugee discourse,
in situations where women are being persecuted as women or because they are women.
However, gender-sensitive interpretation of the existing grounds and the gender inclusive
evolution of the State jurisprudence may provide a timelier redress to the challenge’s women
face in the refugee discourse.

1.1. The Refugee Definition and Barriers to Women’s Claims
In the European Union alone, women constitute, on average, one in three of those applying for asylum
in their own right.1 Although women can be persecuted for the same reasons as men, there are
situations which concern women specifically. Women’s asylum claims relating to gender-related
abuses such as rape, physical abuse, torture and sexual harassment have been largely ignored under
the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees2 (hereafter: the Refugee
Convention) and its 1967 Protocol. The Refugee Convention, with its updating Protocol of 1967, is
the central feature of today’s international regime of refugee protection. One hundred and forty-six
out of total 193 United Nations members have now ratified either one or both instruments (as of
September 2019). Entered into force in 1954, the Refugee Convention is still today the most widely
ratified refugee treaty, providing protection for the activities of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was not until the 1967 Protocol that the geographic and
temporal limits were removed, making the 1951 Convention universally applicable.
Historically, the 1951 Refugee Convention was the international community’s response
to the failure to protect refugees and other persecuted groups fleeing Holocaust.3 The temporary
specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) — International Refugee Organization (IRO)—
catered to the substantial refugee problem caused by the World War II by providing a list defining
who is a refugee (e.g., victims of the Nazi or fascist regimes).4 The 1951 Convention leaves the list
approach behind, proposing a limited but general approach. According to the 1951 Convention, in
order to qualify as a refugee not only must one show that he or she is fleeing from persecution, but
also that there is a causal nexus element between persecution and one of the enumerated Convention
grounds, namely race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership to a particular social
group.5 The Convention does not recognise gender alone as a ground for persecution. Thus gender1

based persecution is often discussed in the context of the ‘membership in a particular group category’
or ‘political opinion’.
Throughout the time, the refugee definition has been interpreted through a framework
of male experiences, which has meant that many claims of women have gone unrecognised.6 The
absence of women’s point of view from international refugee law and policy was discovered during
the 1980’s transnational movement calling for equal inclusion of women within the refugee
protection.7 The movement was acknowledged by the UNHCR and other United Nations (UN) bodies
which began to recognise the gaps in protection for women fleeing gender-based persecution and the
particular issues involved in their cases. Since then, there has been a steady stream of developments
concerning gender-related asylum claims. At the beginning of 1985, the Executive Committee
(ExCom) of the UNHCR issued its first conclusion on refugee women.8 The UNHCR conclusion was
followed by the creation of new field manuals, training programs, and policy documents such as the
1989 UNHCR Policy on Refugee Women, in which women’s concerns were added to the otherwise
unchanged refugee programs.8 This ‘add women and stir’ approach left the overarching framework
unchallenged, leaving the male experience and point of view the norm.9 The ‘add women and stir’
approach and decision-makers involved in refugee determination tendency to view people as refugees
first and women or men second10 has been criticized for relegating gender identities and gender
concerns secondary.11 The criticism pointed out the necessity of placing gender at the centre of the
analysis.12 Meanwhile, women’s concerns were represented as the exception to, or deviation from,
this male standard.13 This compartmentalization means that women-specific programs must compete
with the mainstream programs and policies for finances and resources, leaving women-specific
programs with less power, priority, and resources than the mainstream ones.14
The UN bodies continued the development of more gender-sensitive and genderinclusive refugee discourse, and in 1991, the ExCom recommended the expansion of the refugee
definition to include individuals who have experienced sexual violence or other gender-related forms

of persecution.15 In addition to issuing its guidelines, the UNHCR ExCom has recommended
countries to develop and implement domestic guidelines and criteria regarding protection for
women’s gender-based claims for asylum.

16

Since 1993 many countries signatory to the 1951

Convention and its 1967 Protocol have issued guidelines for gender claims or have amended their
legislation to instruct adjudicators to recognise gender-based persecution as a potential ground for
refugee protection.17 A great number of the national gender guidelines and policy papers focus on
procedural questions or problems and evidentiary considerations that are specific to women’s asylum
claims. It has been recognised that when demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy,
women refugee claimants face special problems. For example, women from certain cultures are
reluctant to disclose their full experiences of gender-specific harm such as sexual violence due to the
dishonour it may bring to the family or because of the stigma. Sometimes the women come from
cultures where they lack access to education, may be illiterate or the women’s only access to
information is via their male relatives or spouses. Some guidelines have emphasized that women
should be given an opportunity to be interviewed on their own, outside the hearing of other family
members, and acknowledge the importance of the availability of female asylum officers, awareness
of different traumas (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, rape trauma syndrome, battered woman
syndrome), body language, interpreters and legal representatives in gender-related cases.18 These
examples provide an implication of how the signatory States have adopted the recommendations of
the UNHCR. However, despite the attempts to harmonize the practice on a national level,
considerable disparities remain, especially with the common law – civil law realms.
The European Parliament has approved two resolutions on the issue.19 Moreover, the
European Union has worked on the harmonization of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS)
and addresses the matter in the Council directive developed as a part of the process.20 In its resolution
of March 13, 2012, the European Parliament called on the Commission “to implement its commitment

to mainstream gender equality in the Common European Asylum System.”21 Against this backdrop
of extensive intergovernmental, executive and legislative activity on gender asylum, the refugee
determination tribunals of a number of states have considered the issue when adjudicating genderbased claims, developing the case law.
The need to integrate women’s concerns lead to an approach called ‘gender
mainstreaming’.22 The approach seeks to integrate women’s concerns “within every corner of the
humanitarian and human rights system” and attempts to assess the seemingly neutral policies,
programs and legislation, in all areas and at all levels.

23

Parallel to many women-specific policies,

the UNHCR developed a ‘two-pronged approach’ of combining specific programs aimed at refugee
women with a focus on integrating their concerns into the ‘mainstream’ projects.24 The approach has
been criticized for achieving the opposite of its intention. Edwards argues that as female claimants
must fit their experiences of violence into male-defined criteria, they are subjected to additional, and
thus unequal, legal burdens.25 Moreover, Charlesworth has voiced concerns about blending the focus
on the exclusion of women with concerns for all refugees generally. She argues that the strategy loses
its critical edge by “allowing the mainstream to tame and deradicalize claims to equality.”26 Indeed,
when women’s claims are not recognised as arising from gender-based persecution, the women’s
experiences are easily ignored.
At the heart of much feminist critique is the gendered assumption of the dichotomy
between public and private spheres where women’s activities are relegated to the undervalued private
sphere and men’s activities to the privileged public sphere.27 This understanding has its roots in the
drafting process of the 1951 Convention where it was decided that “the equality of the sexes was a
matter for national legislation”.28 Thus, States have had much leeway within the refugee discourse to
dismiss the disadvantages suffered by women as ‘private matters’ outside of the scope of international
law.29 This gendered notion of the private and public affects the reading of all aspects of the refugee
definition from codification of the notion of ‘persecution’ to the agents of persecution and what

constitutes a ‘political opinion’.30 Indeed, the interpretations of the Refugee Convention have
typically privileged persecution occurring within the male dominated public sphere, whilst
disregarding the legitimacy of persecution arising from activities within the private sphere.31 This is
substantial in terms of interpreting the enumerated grounds for persecution, particularly ‘political
opinion’, which has been understood in refugee law as “opinions contrary to or critical of the policies
of the government or ruling party.”32 In other words, there is a certain association granted between
the ‘political’ and public spheres involving the State machinery.33 Because women’s experiences are
labelled as ‘private’ and ‘non-political’ it denies them any systematic or societal meaning and
importance, thus making it difficult for the decision-makers to recognise women as deserving refugee
protection.38
Further, one of the issues with the public/ private dichotomy is the way the refugee
Convention conceptualizes the agents of persecution. Unlike in human rights law in general, with the
focus on State responsibility, the refugee law was constructed with State persecution in mind.34
Although women may be victims of State-sanctioned abuse and persecution, alike men, they are also
predominantly targets of certain forms of harm which are labelled ‘intimate’ or ‘private’, such as
domestic or spousal abuse, female genital mutilation (FGM), forced marriage, or honour killings. In
these instances, the persecutor may not be a State official, but rather a member of family or
community.35 This privileging of the public illustrates yet another means of excluding women from
the refugee discourse.
Finally, the last set of criticism arising from the feminist discourse focuses on the ways
in which women have been treated and conceptualized as a homogenous group (the intersectionality
theory). This general theory of gender and identity provides great insight to the multiple forms of
discrimination which affects women’s lives. The woman refugee claimant is affected by the power
structures in the country of origin and in particular by the civil, political and economic position
therein. As explained by Heaven Crawley: “The term ‘gender’… refers to the social construction of
power relations between women and men, and the implications of these relations for women’s (and
men’s) identity, status, roles and responsibilities (in other words, the social organization of sexual
difference). Gender is not static or innate but acquires socially and culturally constructed meaning
because it is a primary way of signifying relations of power. Gender relations and gender differences

are therefore historically, geographically and culturally specific, so that what it is to be a ‘woman’ or
‘man’ varies through space and over time. Any analysis of the way in which gender (as opposed to
biological sex) shapes the experiences of asylum-seeking women must therefore contextualize those
experiences.”36 Focusing on the inter-relationships between various ‘social divisions’, such as gender,
class, sexual orientation, race, and physical ability,37 intersectionality refers to how such categories
constitute axes of identity that intersect and combine in creating unique experiences and identities.38
Women’s experiences of persecution, and the asylum process, are shaped by differences is race, class,
sexuality, age, marital status and so on. Thus, “looking at gender, as opposed to sex, enables an
approach to the refugee definition, which can accommodate specificity, diversity and
heterogeneity.”39 Whilst the ‘add women and stir’ approach sought to ‘add’ the experiences of the
singular group, namely ‘women’, to already existing institutions and programs, the intersectionality
approach seeks a more constitutive way forward. Here, social divisions are not simply added to one
another in constituting identities, but rather combined to make unique experiences.40 Indeed, the
intersectional approach acknowledges that social categories cannot be separated and isolated, instead
they are changeable and dynamic.41
The feminist engagement is multifaceted and dynamic, and there are multiple
perspectives as to how to include women’s experiences into the refugee discourse. Within the
literature reviewed for the purposes of this thesis, however, two diverging approaches emerge. On
the one hand, some scholars and activists argue that the refugee definition, as it appears in the
Convention, can and should be interpreted in new and creative ways in order to ensure proper gender
sensitivity in the ways we understand the conditions of an asylum claim. On the other hand, scholars
also hold that women’s point of view can only be sufficiently incorporated through modification of
the language and definition itself, mainly in the form of adding gender as an additional sixth
enumerated ground for persecution.42 However, the issue of gender-inequality and the barriers to
women’s claims within the refugee law is complex and there is no simple solution or a quick fix to
make the refugee definition gender inclusive.43
The current trend of funnelling women’s gender-based asylum claims into ‘particular
social group’ or ‘political opinion’ category is problematic for multiple reasons. Despite the evolving

Guidelines and State practice it is difficult to understand the precise nature of the reasoning, or
evidential basis on which the findings are made.44 Arguably, the ambiguity, disparity and
inconsistency of the practice of decision-makers, not only goes against the rule of law, but also makes
it difficult for an individual to challenge decisions on appeal. Thus, it provides very little guidance
for future applicants with similar claims.45

1.2. The aim and structure of the thesis
The purpose of this thesis is to better understand the ambiguities and barriers surrounding women’s
gender-based claims under the 1951 Convention grounds ‘particular social group’ and ‘political
opinion’. The ‘particular social group’ ground has been criticized for being the ground with the least
clarity, leading to varying approaches and protection gaps. In addition, in cases where the claimant
has tried her claim under the ‘political opinion’ ground the adjudicators have often refused to see
women’s experiences as political and their claims have been usually adjudicated under other grounds,
such as ‘particular social group’. Thus, this thesis shall examine how the 1951 Convention grounds
‘particular social group’ and ‘political opinion’ are interpreted in a gender-sensitive manner to include
women’s experiences into the refugee discourse; whether gender-sensitive interpretation or adding
gender as an independent ground to the 1951 Convention can better include women’s experiences of
refugee; and what kind of interpretative trends can we find by studying the evolving case law,
scholarly writings, and guidelines.
After the introduction the thesis proceeds to its first substantial chapter (Chapter 2.
Gender-Sensitive Interpretation of Article 1A (2)), which examines the 1951 Convention refugee
definition more in detail. The aim of the chapter is to assess the conceptual barriers that the refugee
definition proposes to women’s claims and whether there are trends or common practices that better
include women’s experiences to the refugee discourse. The subchapters analyse each of the
components of the refugee definition through gendered lenses. First the chapter shall analyse the
definition of ‘well-founded fear’ before proceeding to examine the challenges surrounding the
definition of the term ‘persecution’ (subchapter 2.2). As there is no standard definition of persecution
within the existing refugee framework the subchapter attempts to find answers from scholarly
writings and human rights informed interpretation of ‘persecution’ (subchapter 2.2.2.). After
establishing what is meant by the term ‘persecution’ the thesis proceeds to consider the agents of

persecution (subchapter 2.2.3.). Because a lot of the violence women face emanates from non-state
actors such as spouses or family, the special focus here is on non-state actors of persecution.
Furthermore, to a great extent, the evolution of interpretative tools, such as bifurcated nexus analysis,
has been due to the developments and practice in national courts. Common law jurisdictions provide
an ample of detailed discussion of the ‘particular social group’ category. The Courts have a tendency
to read, analyse and refer to cases decided in other common law countries. In doing so, they contribute
to the development of principles and interpretative tools that help other member states navigate in the
international law realm and uphold consensus in an evolutionary manner. To demonstrate the
interaction between the state jurisdictions this thesis shall undertake a review of cases from Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States after chapter 2.3. The first three
cases provide a trilogy of cases involving women refugees applying for asylum based on genderrelated persecution at the hands of non-state persecutor, in a state with gender inequality and where
the state was unable or unwilling to protect the applicants. These cases provide basis for discussion
of particular issues relating to establishing nexus in gender-related cases, where the perpetrator is a
non-state actor. In contrast to the bifurcated nexus analysis established in Islam; Ex-Parte Shah,
Refugee Appeal No. 71427/99 and Khawar chapter 2.3.4. reviews the inconsistent practice in the
United States where the approaches vary from the requirement of cohesiveness to bifurcated nexus
analysis. In chapter 2.4. the thesis will review national guidelines from Canada, the United Kingdom
and the United States. The purpose of the overview is to identify similarities and differences in
adoption of the UNHCR guidelines on national level and whether it is possible to identify problems
arising from the administrative level that may affect the adjudication of gender-related cases.
Chapter 2 provides a platform for the next two substantial chapters analysing the most
invoked grounds in women’s gender-related refugee claims: ‘membership of a particular social
group’ (chapter 3) and ‘political opinion’ (chapter 4). To better understand the issues surrounding the
funneling of women’s gender-related claims into ‘membership of a particular social group’ ground,
chapter 3 draws from the case law and introduces the two approaches used in defining particular
social groups: The protected characteristic approach (subchapter 3.1.1.) and the social perception
approach (subchapter 3.1.2.). While the aim of chapter 3 is to understand why women’s genderrelated claims are often adjudicated under the ‘particular social group’ ground, chapter 4 seeks to
understand why women’s gender-related claims are so rarely discussed in the political context.
Finally, before concluding the thesis, chapter 5 returns to the question of whether a gender-sensitive
interpretation of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol sufficiently incorporates women’s
experiences of refugee or whether there is a need to add gender as the sixth enumerated ground.

1.3. Methodology, Sources, and Limitations
This thesis has been inspired by the feminist critique surrounding the inclusion of women’s
experiences in the refugee discourse. The feminist critique of international human rights law contains
many disparate strands of theories and many of them overlap. However, for the purposes of this thesis
the focus is limited to the discussion between the liberal feminist (Kantian) approach and the radical
feminist approach. The liberal feminists approach is largely in line with the human rights approach
and assumes, that liberal states with democratically elected officials generally respect human rights
and do not discriminate against individuals, including women.46 According to the liberal feminist,
illegitimate governments may not be embraced as members of liberal alliances.47 This would mean,
that States that fail their duty to protect their citizens should not be rewarded with membership to
liberal alliances such as the UN. This opposition to statism brings the liberal and the radical feminist
together criticizing the international law for overprotecting States through the doctrine of state
sovereignty and non-interference.48 However, while the radical feminist believe in deconstruction of
the system, the liberal feminist believe in reforming it. In other words, arguably the radical feminist
approach proposes that gender should be added as sixth Convention ground to the 1951 Convention,
whilst the liberal feminist approach proposes gender-sensitive interpretation as means to better
incorporate women’s experiences to the refugee discourse.
Further, this thesis has also been influenced by scholars such as Hathaway, Haines,
Foster, Greatbach, Spijkerboer and Musalo, who all have contributed greatly to the debate over
women’s gender-related violence within the context of the 1951 Convention. In addition to the
scholarly input, the thesis adopts a comparative legal methodology in order to understand how
different legal systems operate, interpret and apply the 1951 Convention and the UNCHR Guidelines.
This thesis seeks common methods and trends of gender-sensitive interpretation of Convention
grounds ‘particular social group’ and ‘political opinion’. In doing so the thesis highlights the
evolution of the Convention refugee definition within and across member states. The case study is
limited to landmark cases from common law countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand,
Australia and United States, that have contributed to the evolution of the interpretative mechanisms
surrounding women’s gender-related cases. By reviewing the landmark cases, the reasoning of the
judges and scholarly writings, the thesis seeks pitfalls of the refugee definition and its interpretation
that may exclude women’s experiences of refugee. Similarly, to the case study, the national guidelines

assessed in chapter 2.4. are limited to Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. By limiting
the assessment guidelines to these three common law states, the thesis attempts to shed light to three
seemingly similar legal regimes, that however, have a very different administrative structures that
affect the outcomes of the refugee cases.
The focus of this thesis is limited to the aspects of legal interpretation rather than the
evidential and procedural issues; thus, it shall consider other means of protection (i.e., subsidiary
protection or internal flight alternatives) only briefly. Furthermore, the aim is to keep the focus on the
1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol refugee definition. For the purposes of the study, it will not
consider other Convention grounds than ‘particular social group’ and ‘political opinion’ in more
detail.

1.4. Definitions: Gender-based Persecution
Women’s gender-based persecution can be understood in two ways. A distinction must be made
between women who are persecuted as women and women who are being persecuted because they
are women (by woman, this thesis means persons who are biologically female and also identify
themselves as females). 49 The first concept relates to the gender-specific forms of persecution such
as rape, FGM, or domestic abuse. The second concept, women who are persecuted because they are
women, relates to the causal relationship between gender and persecution. This two-pronged
definition of gender-based persecution illuminates that a female may be persecuted both as and
because she is a female.50

2. Gender-Sensitive Interpretation of Article 1A(2)
Considering the international refugee definition in the historical context, we can see that there have
been conceptual barriers for women meeting the refugee definition. Under the 1951 Refugee
Convention and its Protocol, a refugee is defined as a person who “owing to a well-founded fear of
being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or
political opinion is outside of the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such

for Equality Begins, 6 Tex. J. Women & L. 181 (1997) p. 184. where he argues that gender-based persecution

14

fear, unwilling to avail himself or herself to the protection of that country.”51 Thus, the refugee
definition is understood to require proof of:
(1) An objectively reasonable fear of harm that is serious enough to be considered ‘persecution’
(2) which is causally linked or bears a “nexus” to race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group, or political opinion.
The barriers to women’s claims that arise from this definition are threefold. First, an issue arises from
the definition and understanding of the term ‘persecution’. Often the harms inflicted on women were
not considered to be persecutions because the harms these women suffered were often seen as cultural
practices or religious norms instead of persecution (e.g., female genital mutilation), belonging to the
private sphere. Alternatively, the harms suffered may have been different from men’s harms under
similar circumstance (e.g., men may be beaten while women may be raped).52 This understanding of
the public/private dichotomy affects the reading of all aspects of the refugee definition from the notion
of ‘persecution’ to the agents of persecution and to what constitutes ‘political opinion’. Because
women’s experiences are labelled as ‘private’ or ‘non-political’, it denies them any systematic or
societal meaning, as if they do not exist, making it difficult for the decision-makers to recognise
women as deserving refugee protection.53
Second, the refugee Convention was constructed with State persecution in mind.54 Often
the persecution faced by women is the result of societal norms or is committed by non-state actors,
such as husbands, fathers, or members of the applicant’s extended community. Although some
Convention parties accept persecution by non-state actors as a basis for protection where the
government cannot or will not control these actors, this recognition has been slow in coming.
Third, and most importantly, the international definition of refugee requires a nexus or
connection between the harm or persecution and one of the five grounds (race, religion, nationality,
political opinion, or membership in a particular group). Women are often persecuted because of their
gender, and gender is not one of the five grounds in the Convention definition.55 Arguably, as women
must ‘fit’ their experiences of violence into existing male-defined grounds and criteria, they are
subject to additional and unequal legal burdens.56

Neither the refugee definition nor the 1951 Convention, in general, refers to sex or
gender.57 However, as Rodger Haines QC argues, sex and gender are already included in the 1951
Convention:
“The text, object, and purpose of the 1951 Convention require a gender-inclusive and
gender-sensitive interpretation. Sex and gender are already included in the refugee
definition. If the sight of this fact is lost, a misconceived interpretation can reflect and
reinforce gender biases leading to the marginalization of women in the refugee
context”.58
Indeed, given the ordinary meaning of Article 1A (2) of the 1951 Convention in the context and the
light of the object and purpose of the Convention, it requires that the Convention protects both women
and men and that it must therefore be given a gender-inclusive and gender-sensitive interpretation.
Further, the UNHCR Gender Guidelines recognize the interpretation (and interpretative frameworks)
as the source of the issues concerning gender, and the refugee definition, rather than the aspects of
the law itself. 59 Historically, the refugee definition has been interpreted through a framework of male
experiences, which is why the refugee cannot speak of gender and many claims of women have gone
unrecognized.60 Gender Guidelines can be read as creating framework in which the approach of
gender-sensitive interpretation is favoured over that of altering the text of the refugee definition. It
does so because it implies that even if the concepts of gender and gender-based persecution are
formally introduced into the language of law, their meaning would still be unclear and subject to
interpretation and differing definitions in any case.61
The UNHCR has confirmed that although gender is absent as a listed ground in the
Refugee Convention itself, a gender-sensitive interpretation should be given with regard to the
existing grounds.62 As a direct response to the confusion and unpredictability surrounding genderrelated cases, the UNHCR publication Guidelines on International Protection: Gender-Related
Persecution within the context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol relating

to the Status of Refugees63 (Gender Guidelines) seeks to provide guidance to decision-makers on how
to conduct a gender-sensitive interpretation of the refugee definition, define the problem and provide
redress to the issue.64 The Guidelines chooses to “specifically focus on the interpretation of the
refugee definition from a gender perspective as well as propose some procedural practices”.65 In the
same instance, the UNHCR issued guidelines regarding the membership in a particular social group
in the context of the 1951 Convention.66
The very first sentence of the Gender Guidelines recognise that “’gender-related
persecution’ is a term that has no legal meaning per se“67 establishing that the framework for the
discussion is one of legal terms and their meanings.68 Additionally, it points towards the problem
inherent in the relationship between gender and refugee law, namely that law does not have the terms
to describe gendered persecution.69 In other words, “gender inequality within refugee law is a
question of recognition; of how to recognise gender-elements within a legal language where such
terms have no meaning per se.”70

2.1. Well-founded Fear
The 1951 Convention refugee definition requires proof that the applicant owes a well-founded fear
of being persecuted for a Convention reason. In other words, it must be likely that the person
concerned will face persecution if returned to his or her country of origin. As a general rule, the
concept has both a subjective (‘fear’) and objective (‘well-founded) element, and they both must be
taken into account when determining whether there is a well-founded fear of persecution. This view
has, however, been criticised as historically indefensible and having no practical meaning.71 Instead,
Hathaway argues, the term ‘fear’ is intended to emphasise a future risk in the country of origin; not a
subjective emotion of fear. Hence the test is an objective one in order to determine the present or
future risk the applicant faces.72

Another question relates to the standard of proof to be applied in determining refugee
status. The standards of proof as to when fear is well-founded applied by authorities in different
countries vary (e.g., a reasonable degree of likelihood of persecution, clear probability of persecution,
reasonable probability, persecution as more likely than not).73 The appropriate starting point in
determining whether the applicant’s fear of persecution is well-founded is an examination of the
general human rights record of the applicant’s country. Human rights information is, however, not
determinative of a claim to refugee status; the usefulness of human rights data is to establish a
rebuttable presumption of risk of harm which then must be tested against the whole of the evidence
presented, in particular claimant’s own evidence and testimony.74 The fear of persecution must not
(necessarily) be based on the personal experiences of the applicant. Experiences of friends or relatives
or other persons belonging to the same race or social group can indicate that the applicant’s fear of
being persecuted is well-founded. Further, a person is considered as having a well-founded fear of
being persecuted if she or he has already been subject to harm amounting to persecution.75 Past
persecution, however, is not a prerequisite to recognition as a refugee.
The requirement that the claimant holds a ‘well-founded’ fear of being persecuted if
turned to the country of origin requires a forward-looking objective assessment of the risk of
persecution faced by the claimant.76 This proposes major challenges for the adjudicators, where little
is known of the actual conditions in the country of origin.77 As the UNHCR handbook indicates:
“While the burden of proof in principle lies on the refugee claimant, the duty to ascertain
and evaluate all the relevant facts is shared between the claimant and the examiner.
Indeed, in some cases, it may be for the examiner to use all the means at his disposal to
produce the necessary evidence in support of the application. Even such independent
research may not, however, always be successful and there may also be Statements that
are not susceptible of proof. In such cases, if the applicant’s account appears credible,
he should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the
doubt. The requirement of evidence should thus not be too strictly applied in view of

the difficulty of proof inherent in the special situation in which an applicant for refugee
status finds himself.”78
As indicated by the Handbook, the burden of proof lies on the refugee claimant, although the duty
to ascertain and evaluate the facts is shared with the claimant and the examiner. This proposes
significant additional obstacles for many women to establish their claim for refugee status. Many
may come from countries where they have been denied meaningful or any education and may be
illiterate. These women may have been denied meaningful participation in life and may thus be
inarticulate. In some countries, women live in seclusion. A little may be known about them or their
status or their treatment, both in their society at large and in the home. Moreover, there may be little
information as to their ability to access meaningful State protection. Therefore, the shared
responsibility of the adjudicator to ascertain all the relevant facts and the benefit of the doubt
principle in such cases must be given meaningful effect.79

2.2. ‘Persecution’ = Risk of Serious Harm and Failure of State Protection
To accurately determine a gender-specific case, it is fundamental to understand the nature of the
concept of ‘persecution’. Unlike the criterion of ‘well-founded fear’, which focuses on evidentiary
standards in assessing claims for refugee status, the term persecution refers to the substantive nature
of the harm feared. As discovered earlier in this thesis, women often experience persecution
differently from men.80 The harms inflicted on women were often not considered to be persecutions
because they were condoned or required by culture or religion (e.g. female genital mutilation,
repressive social norm), disproportionately inflicted on women (e.g. domestic violence), or simply
different from the harms suffered by men under similar circumstance.81 This was demonstrated in
the case of Campos Guardado v. I.N.S82 where it was found that a female asylum seeker who was
forced to watch mutilation and murder of male family members and who was raped while perpetrators
shouted political slogans did not meet the refugee definition. Beatings and torture inflicted in a
political context were adjudicated as political persecution, while rape in the same context was not.83

One of the challenges in placing gender-specific persecution within the existing refugee
framework is that there is no standard definition of ‘persecution’.84 Article 31 and 33 of the 1951
Refugee Convention refer to those whose life or freedom ‘was’ or ‘would be’ threatened. However,
it must be emphasized that persecution cannot be defined only as threats to life and freedom.85 It can
be gathered from the Convention that persecution readily includes, but is not restricted to, threats to
life, limb or liberty. In addition, it is indisputable that severe ill-treatment including torture, rape,
genital mutilation, etc. as well as arbitrary detention amount to persecution.86
The Convention taken as a whole (text, object and purpose, travaux preparatoires) does
not offer any clear-cut criteria to judge whether a host of ‘treatments’ amount to persecution. A
traditional approach to the challenge of indeterminacy is to proceed on a case-by-case basis, defining
the relevant test through very broad formulas intended to reflect the “true meaning” of the word. This
view has been emphasized by the UNHCR in its Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for
Determining Refugee Status which further draws from Article 33 of the 1951 Convention. While the
Handbook voices that persecution is “a threat to life or freedom on account of race, religion,
nationality, political opinion or membership to a particular social group”,87 it emphasises that the list
should not be seen as exhaustive. The Handbook continues by saying:
“Whether other prejudicial actions or threats would amount to persecution will depend
on the circumstances in each case, including subjective element to which reference has
been made… the subjective character of fear of persecution requires an evaluation of
the opinions and feelings of the person concerned. It is also the light of such opinions
and feelings that any actual or anticipated measures against him must necessarily be
viewed. Due to variations in the psychological make-up of individuals and in the
circumstances in each case, the interpretations of what amounts to persecutions are
bound to vary.”88
Therefore, persecution must be viewed case-by-case basis, considering the individual circumstances
of each case. This view is supported by the feminist intersectional theory, which acknowledges that
the woman refugee claimant is affected by multiple factors, such as the power structures in the country

of origin and in particular by the civil, political and economic position therein. The effects of gender
and what it is to be a woman, or a man, varies through space and time. Women’s experiences of
persecution, and the asylum process, are shaped, inter alia, by differences in race, class, sexuality age,
marital status, and history. Thus, making every woman’s experience of persecution unique.89
As the concept of ‘persecution’ must be interpreted as a flexible, evolutionary concept90
States are allowed a wide margin of appreciation when it comes to interpreting the term ‘persecution’,
which has led to a practice that is neither coherent nor consistent.91 While the approach provides
flexibility to the concept of ‘persecution’ and thus enables it to expand and to adapt, it also endangers
predictability, objectivity, and consistency within and across jurisdictions at large.92 The liberal, case
by case assessment of persecution provides little assurance to the future cases, as the outcomes depend
on such a variety of factors and the individuals involved. In theory, while such a casuistic approach
opens the door to very liberal interpretations of the concept of persecution, it often results in very
restrictive interpretations.93 The inconsistency, subjectivity, narrowness- more than justify the longstanding effort to find a more principled approach to the ‘persecution’ concept- an approach that
would maintain certain flexibility, but at the same time guarantee a reasonably liberal interpretation,
as well as more consistent and objective decision-making within and across States.

2.2.1. What Harm is Serious Enough?
To assess whether an individual faces a risk of persecution requires identification of the serious
harms faced in the country of origin and an assessment of the State’s ability and willingness to
respond effectively to that risk.94 Thus, persecution constructs two separate but essential
elements, namely risk of serious harm and failure of State protection.95 While persecution may
be defined as the sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure
of State protection, the refugee definition does not require the perpetrator to be the State agent

itself. Equally, persecution at the hands of non-state agents of persecution falls within the
definition. It is the State’s inability to protect an individual from persecution, which constitutes
failure of local protection.96 Therefore the question is whether the protection against persecution
that is available in the country of his/her nationality is sufficiently lacking to enable the person to
obtain protection internationally as a refugee.97
According to Haines, there are at least four situations in which it can be said that there is
a failure of State protection, namely when:
1. persecution committed by the State concerned
2. persecution condoned by the State concerned
3. persecution tolerated by the State concerned; and
4. persecution not condoned or not tolerated by the State concerned but nevertheless
present because the State refuses or is unable to offer adequate protection
Thus, according to Haines, State complicity is not always a prerequisite to a valid refugee claim.98
The purpose of refugee law is to identify those who have a well-founded fear of
persecution for a Convention reason. A refugee claimant is not required to risk his or her life seeking
ineffective protection of a State, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.99 Thus, the proper
approach to the question of State protection is to enquire whether the protection available from the
State of origin will reduce the risk of serious harm below the level of well-founded.100 This does not
mean that the State is required to eliminate the risk of harm,101 however, the protection must be
meaningful, accessible, effective, and available to all regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, disability, religion, class, age, occupation or any other aspect of identity, before it can be
said that the refugee claimant has access to State protection. In other words, the protection must be
available in actual practice, not just in theory.

As early as 1953, Jacques Vernant posited that the concept of ‘persecution’ should be equated to
“Severe measures of an arbitrary nature, incompatible with the principles set forth in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights” (UDHR).102 Indeed, in order to truly grasp the notion of ‘persecution’,
a comprehensive analysis today will require a fair assessment of the related developments within the
broad field of human rights. With the decisive development of international human rights law, and
with the contribution of scholars such as James Hathaway, the human rights informed approach to
the concept of persecution has come to be accepted as the standard view to the question.103
Hathaway has defined persecution as “the sustained and systematic violation of basic
human rights demonstrative of a failure of State protection.”104 He has proposed a firm separation
between the term ‘persecution’ on the one hand and the violation of the rights that are enshrined in
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)105 and the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),106 on the other hand. For the purposes of this
thesis, this chapter shall not consider all the nuances that Hathaway’s position takes into account
when considering the diversity of the rights that are recognised by the ICCPR and the ICESCR, as
it is far too sophisticated to be rendered in full here. However, a brief summary is necessary in order
to understand the main characters of his concept. First, Hathaway posits that a violation of nonderogable civil and political rights is per se sufficiently severe to amount to ‘persecution’. These
rights include, for example, the prohibition of torture, the right to life, and the right to legal
personality. Second, a failure to respect and ensure other civil and political rights would amount to
persecution unless the conditions for a derogation are met. Such rights include, for instance, freedom
of expression as well as personal freedom. Third, the denial of economic, social and cultural rights
amount to persecution when it is discriminatory in itself or when it is so complete that the State in
question cannot be said to be taking ‘appropriate steps’ to realize those rights.
Hathaway’s position has been criticized for being both too restrictive and too generous
at the same time.107 Despite the criticism, the approach is widely accepted in the literature and
followed by several jurisdictions.108 The human rights informed approach is strongly supported by
UNHCR. It has maintained that “While international and regional human rights treaties and the
corresponding jurisprudence and decisions of the respective supervisory bodies influence the
interpretation of the 1951 Convention, persecution cannot and should not be defined solely on the

basis of serious or severe human rights violations”.109 In addition, authors and jurisdictions that
adhere to the human rights view are reluctant to see persecution in the violation of just any of the
rights enshrined in the covenants. Thus, even after applying Hathaway’s carefully crafted
qualifications, the concept of persecution does not implicate the full range of rights listed in the
Covenants and requires consideration of the facts case by case basis.
Compared to Hathaway’s approach, the EU espouses a slightly more restrictive
position. The human rights informed approach has been unambiguously endorsed by Article 9 of the
EU Qualification Directive, which provides that:
“Acts of persecution within the meaning of Article 1 A of the Geneva Convention must
be sufficiently serious by their nature or repetition as to constitute a severe violation
of basic human rights, in particular the rights from which derogation cannot be made
under Article 1582 of the European Convention of Human Rights: or be accumulation
of various measures, including violations of human rights which is sufficiently severe
as to affect an individual in a similar manner as mentioned in (a)”110
Thus, only the grave violations of some fundamental human rights are per se an act of persecution.
The violation of other human rights must be cumulated with other harmful measures in order to
attain the requisite level of seriousness.111 However, as not all jurisdictions have accepted this
approach, noteworthy divergences in the interpretation of the concept of persecution remain.112
Maiani argues that the divergences are rooted in different legal conceptions as to the proper role of
human rights instruments in the interpretation of the concept of persecution. According to Maiani,
there is either a loose reference or throughout “colonization” of refugee law by human rights law.113
The term persecution is closely linked with human rights, and human rights-based
understanding of the concept of persecution is generally supported. The roots of the 1951 Convention
are in the international community’s commitment to assuring the fundamental human rights114without

discrimination,115 however, the Convention does not protect persons against all forms of serious
harm.116 Hathaway’s linkage with the Covenants has been criticised for being too tight, and it has
been argued that the concept of persecution does not directly implicate the full range of rights listed
in the Covenants.117 However, Hathaway’s definition has been widely accepted both in case law and
in State practice.118 According to the dominant view, refugee law ought to concern itself with actions
that deny human dignity in a key way and that the sustained or systematic denial of core human rights
is the appropriate standard.119 There must be a risk of a certain type of harm, which is inconsistent
with the basic duty of protection owed by the State to its own population.120 Thus, for the purposes
of this thesis, persecution would be most appropriately described as “the sustained or systemic failure
of State protection in relation to one of the core elements which has been recognised by the
international community.”121

2.2.3. Non-state Agents of Persecution
The fundamental principle behind refugee protection is that of ‘surrogate protection’, where
international protection is provided where the applicant’s State of nationality has failed their basic
human rights duties owed to its population.122 As emphasised earlier in this thesis, much of the
violence faced by women is committed by non-state actors such as husbands, fathers, in-laws and
sometimes even by the women in the local community. (i.e., in cases of female genital mutilation).
In most common law countries, persecution at the hands of non-state actors has now been accepted
in situations where the State is unable or unwilling to offer effective protection against such harm
(the so-called ‘protection view’).123 Under Australian jurisprudence, for example, this may include
condoning or tolerating harm perpetrated by non-state agents, refusing or being unable to offer
adequate protection.124

The surrogate protection view is supported by the European Commission’s directive
on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or Stateless persons as beneficiaries
of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary
protection, and for the content of the protection granted.125 Paragraph 14 States:
“Member States should have the power to introduce or maintain more favourable
provisions than the standards laid down in this Directive for third-country nationals or
Stateless persons who request international protection from a Member State, where such
a request is understood to be on the grounds that the persons concerned is either a
refugee within the meaning of Article 1 (A) of the Geneva Convention, or a person
eligible for subsidiary protection.”126
Further, the directive proposes that persecution may originate from non-state actors, thus advancing
the cause of gender-related claims.127 Also, the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and criteria for
Determining refugee Status clarifies that while persecution is normally related to action by the
authorities of a country, it may also emanate from sections of the population if the acts are knowingly
tolerated by the authorities or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer effective protection.128
Almost 20 years ago, the High Court of Australia in Khawar129 reconfirmed the
approach adopted by the House of Lords in Horvath,130 in which the failure of the State to provide
protection was seen as “the bridge between persecution by the State and persecution by non-state
agents which is necessary for the interest of the consistency of the whole scheme”.131 Here, the High
Court of Australia reaffirmed the decision of the Federal Court of Australia to grant refugee status to
Mrs. Khawar, who claimed that she was the victim of serious and prolonged domestic violence on
the part of her husband and members of his family. The police in Pakistan refused to enforce the law
against such violence or otherwise offer her protection. Such refusal was considered not only to be a
mere inability to provide protection but also “alleged tolerance and condonation”.132

As established in Khawar133 the refugee definition does not require a State to be the
perpetrator, and persecution by ‘private’ or non-state agents may equally fall within the refugee
definition. This supports the 1951 Convention refugee definition, which does not describe from whom
persecution must originate. However, despite the positive development in common law jurisdictions,
some of the civil law jurisdictions are more divided and tend to require some level of accountability
of the State. Although substantial positive case law now exists on the question of claiming refugee
status on the basis of domestic violence, it still remains the ultimate test of the durability of the
surrogate protection approach.
2.2.4. Agents of persecution and the ‘Internal Flight Alternative’ (IFA)
A person is a refugee if she or he is likely to face persecution for Convention reason if returned to his
or her country of origin. Internal flight alternative (IFA) or internal relocation alternative (IRA) refers
to “a specific area of the country where there is no risk of a well-founded fear of persecution and
where, given the particular circumstances of the case, the individual would be expected to establish
him/ herself and live a normal life.”134 The concept of internal flight alternatives has formed in an ad
hoc manner through jurisprudence, scholarly writings and policy Statements,135 and there is no
consistent approach to the concept, and consequently, divergent jurisdiction has emerged both within
and across jurisdictions.136 Although the Refugee Convention does not include any references to
internal flight alternatives and the concept is not an independent test in the determination of refugee
status,137some have interpreted the “well-founded fear of being persecuted” or “unwilling... or
unable... to avail himself of the protection of that country” clause of the refugee definition to include
the concept of IFA. This interpretation, however, is unnecessary as the 1951 Convention does not
require (or even suggest) that the fear of being persecuted need always extend to the whole territory
of the refugee’s country of origin.138
The IFA test does not in principle require a conceptual understanding of the notion but
a consensus as to which facts justify the assessment that an IFA is available. Moreover, it must be
considered whether the claimant could reasonably be expected to relocate and live safely there at the

time being and for the foreseeable future.139 In order to assess these factors, State practice has evolved
a four-step approach. First, the decision-maker must examine whether the claimant can genuinely
access the proposed site. Second, risks of persecution for a Convention ground must be addressed.
Third, applying the IFA test requires consideration of the risk of other forms of serious harm not
related to Convention reasons, even if not rising to the level of persecution. Finally, the inquiry
requires, by means of the reasonableness test, also the provision of basic human rights in the
relocation area, which is a matter of great controversy.140
Where the risk of being persecuted emanates from State authority, the IFA test is not
normally a relevant consideration as it can be presumed that the State is entitled to act throughout the
country of origin.141 The IFA was originally strictly linked to cases where the persecutory acts
happened at the hands of a non-state actor. To date, it still is the most prominent example of the IFA
test. Where the persecutor is a non-state actor, the feasibility of an IFA depends upon the likelihood
of the persecutor to pursue the claimant to the area concerned and whether State protection from the
harm feared is available there. In other words, the ability and willingness of the State to protect the
claimant from the feared harm must be taken into account. Thus, the motivation of the persecutor, the
ability of the persecutor to pursue the claimant in the proposed area, and the State protection available
to the claimant in that area must be assessed. 142
As illustrated above, there is a close link between the issue of the agent of persecution
and the question of IFA. Gender-related persecution often emanates from non-state actors, such as
partners, community or family, and it is easy for the decision-makers to resort to the use of an IFA
test. The lack of uniform and principled application of the notion of IFA and its routine use to deny
refugee status to a claimant who cannot produce enough evidence to negate the possibility of an
internal flight alternative imposes an additional challenge to women who claim refugee based on
gender-related violence.
2.3. Nexus with a Convention Ground
After establishing that the harm faced amounts to persecution, the claimant must be able to show that
there is a nexus element between the feared harm and one or more of the enumerated Convention
grounds. The word itself, nexus, derives from the Convention language for reasons of (e.g.,” well139

founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, membership of a particular social group
or political opinion”) if women are persecuted for their gender, rather than for reasons common to
both women and men there are interpretative obstacles because gender is not one of the enumerated
Convention grounds.143 However, the Convention ground need not be the dominant ground for the
persecution, but it must have a ‘relevant contributing factor’.144 Although it is accepted that nexus
requires proof of some relationship between the feared harm and the Convention ground, there is a
great variance as to the nature of that relationship. 145
In short, nexus analysis consists of a two-step process: the identification of the
relevant Convention ground, followed by the establishment of the causal connection between this
ground and the persecution.146 However, the United States has taken the test further and adopted a
test, which requires proof that the persecutor was motivated by a Convention reason (cohesion
requirement).147 Other States have left the question of the meaning open or have indicated that its
meaning may vary depending on the context of the claim.148
The Guidelines on Social Group and Gender-Related Persecution adopt without
reservation the bifurcated nexus analysis that characterized the decisions from the United
Kingdom,149 Australia,150 and New Zealand.151 The tribunals established that where the actions of the
State or the non-state actor is related to Convention reason. The Social Group Guidelines express the
rule as follows:
“The causal link may be satisfied:
(1) Where there is a real risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-state actor
for reasons which are related to one of the Convention grounds, whether or not
the failure of the State to protect the claimant is Convention related; or

(2) Where the risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-state actor is unrelated
to a Convention ground, but the inability or unwillingness of the State to offer
protection is for a Convention reason.”152
The Social Group Guidelines adopt a broader application of the nexus analysis than the Gender
Guidelines and implicates that the purpose of the bifurcated nexus analysis is to help resolve the
controversy over nexus in gender cases. 153 The unequivocal adoption of bifurcated nexus analysis in
both sets of Guidelines provide welcome clarity and harmony to the UNHCR’s position on the
issue.154 The UNHCR has made a standing contribution to the evolving jurisprudence on the issue of
gender persecution by affirming the approach taken by the tribunals of the United Kingdom,
Australia, and New Zealand, and implicitly by the United States in Matter of Kasinga155. Although
the recommendations of the UNHCR are not binding on the States, the weight of authority supporting
this interpretive approach provides a steady guidance for the States in cases where women are fleeing
gender-related persecution. The adoption of this analytical approach has been praised by scholars
such as Musalo, who emphasises that the key element for the nexus element in all four countries was
namely the bifurcated analysis.156” The bifurcated approach does not limit the nexus consideration to
an analysis of the motives of the individual perpetrator of the persecution but includes societal and
State factors in the equation.”157
Traditionally, the nexus requirement has posed a substantial barrier to women’s genderbased claims because gender is not one of the existing Convention grounds. Thus, women’s claims
must be adjudicated in relation to the existing grounds, which have been constructed from the male
paradigm. Furthermore, adjudicators have been slow to accept a causal connection between an
applicant’s gender and the harm inflicted upon her.158 Especially where the persecutor is a non-state
actor, and the motivation for the harm is presumed to derive from the private sphere; the difficulty is
aggravated. The tribunals have developed the bifurcated interpretive framework, introduced briefly
above, which allowed the requisite causal connection to be established in relation to either the non-

See Social Group Guidelines (n. 63), para 23.; Paragraph 21 of the Gender Guidelines (n. 6) which both articulate the
same rule: “In cases where there is a risk of being persecuted at the hands of a non-state actor (e.g., husband, partner or
other non-state actor) for reasons which are related to one of the Convention grounds, the causal link is established,
whether or not the absence of State protection is Convention related. Alternatively, where the risk of being persecuted at
the hands of a non-state actor is unrelated to a Convention ground, but the inability or unwillingness of the State to offer
protection is for reasons of a Convention ground. the causal link is also established.”

state perpetrator or the state/society. The cases were initially rejected by the adjudicators who ruled
that there was no causal link between the feared persecution and the gender of the asylum applicant.
However, on appeal, the nexus issue was favourably resolved, and the approach adopted by the courts
provides a positive precedent for future gender claims.
The following subchapters review the evolution of bifurcated nexus analysis in a trilogy
of cases159 from different jurisdiction that all encompass women’s gender-related persecution at the
hands of non-state persecutor, in a state that has gender inequality and where the state is unable or
unwilling to provide protection to the applicants.
2.3.1. United Kingdom: Islam; Ex Parte Shah
The first case introduced in the trilogy of cases considering the issue of establishing nexus in genderrelated cases is the famous Islam; Ex Parte Shah,160 in which the House of Lords considered the
conjoined appeals of two Pakistani women who fled marital violence. Although the individual
circumstances of the two women were different in various respects, both claims involved feared harm
at the hands of non-state actors in situations where the state failed to provide protection.161 In order
to decide the case, the House of Lords had to consider whether a particular social group could be
defined by reference to gender and to determine if there was a requisite nexus between the feared
persecution and the Convention ground. The House of Lords answered in the affirmative on both
counts, employing a bifurcated analysis to resolve the next issue.162
The first one of the two appellants was a teacher named Shahanna Islam. Her husband
had often been violent, but the catalyst for her flight was false accusations of infidelity, which arose
from her efforts to intervene between rival political factions at the school where she taught. Due to
these accusations, her husband assaulted her so brutally that she was admitted to the hospital twice.
Her attempts to escape her husband within Pakistan by staying with her brother were unsuccessful.
The second appellant, Syeda Shah, had been forced out of her family home by her husband. She gave
birth shortly after arriving in the United Kingdom. Mrs. Shah feared that her husband would accuse
her of adultery and either beat her himself or denounce her under Sharia law for immorality, which
could result in “lashes in public or stoning to death.”163

The evidence in the record documented institutionalized discrimination against women
in Pakistan. Although the Pakistani Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, “a
woman’s place in society in Pakistan is low.”164 Domestic abuse is prevalent, which is both
“tolerated” and “sanctioned” by the State.165 Women must submit to the wills of their husbands, and
women who are forced to leave their marital home or who decide to leave are at special risk because
they can be charged with adultery and sexual immorality.166 In such cases, the statutory law
discriminates against women by prohibiting their testimony or considering them guilty unless they
can establish themselves to be innocent.167
The cases had been considered by special adjudicators, the Immigration Appeal
Tribunal, and the Court of Appeal, where the adjudicators had not doubted that the fear of violence
by the applicant’s husbands was well-founded. However, they rejected the argument that the
applicants were members of a particular social group and that the persecution was linked to this
membership.168 In a four to one decision, the House of Lords disagreed, finding that the women were
members of gender-defined social group, namely ‘Pakistani women’, and that although their
husbands did not persecute them for this reason, the State failed to protect them because they were
women. Finally, it was found in the case Islam; Ex Parte Shah, that the two Pakistani women satisfied
the element of persecution after being found to be at risk of false accusations of adultery, an act
punishable in Pakistan by flogging or stoning to death. 169 The issue remained, however, whether the
claimants were at risk of being persecuted “for reasons of” their membership in a particular social
group, namely “Pakistani women”. Relying heavily on the BIA’s decision in the Matter of Acosta,170
as well as on principles of non-discrimination, three of the four Lords in the majority (Steyn,
Hoffman, and Hope of Graighead) defined the relevant social group in terms of gender alone: “women
in Pakistan”.171 Lord Hutton, on the other hand, accepted a narrower subset described as “Pakistani
women suspected of adultery and unprotected by State and public authorities”.172 All four Lords
rejected the government’s argument of “cohesiveness” as a requirement.173
After concluding that the women were within the scope of the words ‘particular

social group’,174 the Lords turned to the question of nexus between the persecution and membership
in gender-defined social groups. Lord Millet found that, even if the wider group of “Pakistani women”
did constitute a particular social group, the applicants did not fear persecution for reasons of
membership of such group. His Lordship recognised the discrimination the women in Pakistan face
but distinguished this from Convention-related persecution. Lord Millet argues that the appellants
feared harm because they had transgressed social norms, not because they were women. In his opinion
his Lordship stated:
“The evidence clearly established that women in Pakistan are treated as inferior to men
and subordinate to their husbands and that, by international standards, they are subject
to serious and quite unacceptable discrimination on account of their sex. But
persecution is not merely an aggravated form of discrimination, and even if women (or
married women) constitute a particular social group, it is not accurate to say that those
women in Pakistan who are persecuted are persecuted because they are members of it.
They are persecuted because they are thought to have transgressed social norms, not
because they are women. There is no evidence that men who transgress the different
social norms which apply to them are treated more favourably.”175
The Lords concluded that the “serious harm” of spousal violence was a “personal affair, directed
against the applicants as individuals”176and therefore not causally linked to their gender-defined
social group status. Furthermore, the Lords observed that persecution was not limited to the
husband’s actions but was the result of the separate and combined elements of the husband’s
violence and the failure of State protection. The recognition of two constituent elements allowed
the bifurcated analysis; the Lords ruled that although the husbands’ actions were not linked to
gender, the State’s failure to protect was, and on this basis, nexus to the Convention ground of
particular social group could be established. According to Lord Hoffman, two elements were needed
in cases involving a non-state agent of persecution in order to establish a social group nexus. First,
there is the threat of violence to the claimant by her husband. This is a personal affair directed against
them as individuals. Secondly, there is the inability or unwillingness of the State to do anything to
protect them. The evidence was that the State would not assist them because they were women. It
denied them protection against violence which it would have given to men. The combination of these

175

33

two elements was held to constitute persecution within the meaning of the Convention.177 Lord
Hoffman expressed the bifurcated approach by the formula: Persecution = Serious Harm + Failure
of State Protection. Pursuant to this formula, the required nexus is established if either of the
constituent elements of persecution is causally related to a Convention reason. Alternatively
expressed, Lord Hoffman’s rule is: Persecution has two elements; nexus is established if either is
linked to a Convention reason.
The case of Islam; Ex Parte Shah was historic in determining nexus in reference to the
individual persecutor as well as the State. Traditionally, claims to the asylum by men involved a direct
link between the action of the State to suppress, intimidate, or imprison the claimant and one or more
Convention ground. This view would discriminate against women who are likely to be subject to
indirect links between the persecution and the action of the State, through an inability or
unwillingness of the State to protect them. Thus, the approach introduced in the case enhances the
equitable treatment of men and women before the law. It established an analytical path around the
barrier created by the characterization of domestic violence as “private” or “personal” rather than as
a Convention ground.
Although praised, the view adopted by the Lords with regards to the characterization of
spousal violence as a “personal affair, directed against the applicants as individuals” and therefore
not causally linked to their gender-defined social group status,178 has also been criticized by scholars
such as Karen Musalo. According to Musalo, it is certainly possible that the Lords must have found
a Convention reason inherent in both element of persecution: the spousal beatings and the failure of
State protection.”179 She questions the Lords’ assumption that spousal violence is not causally related
to gender because it is traditionally seen as private. Thus, the analysis adopted in the case runs counter
to the growing body of understanding of domestic violence in this regard. 180 Similar thoughts were
emphasized by the honourable Justice Deirdre O’Connor (Federal Court of Australia), who voiced
that “perhaps the major difference between the approaches of majority and minority truly lies in their
assumptions about gender, and the extent to which each was prepared to conceptualise what is
traditionally “private harm” (domestic violence) as serious harm which should be addressed in the
public sphere, and for which the State must bear some responsibility”.181

The case of Islam; Ex Parte Shah provided a steppingstone for further developments in
the field for more gender-inclusive refugee discourse. However, it is not a ‘floodgates’ case. At
several points of the case, the Law Lords note that the case turns upon facts, and although the
claimants were successful as ‘women in Pakistan’, it does not mean that all Pakistani women will be
successful in the future. Each case must be examined case-by-case basis on its merits. As each claim
is constituted by a converge of all elements of the definition, differences in the individual matrix will
inevitably produce a different result.
Moreover, the majority of the Law Lords provided support for moving towards breaking
down the conceptual barriers of public-private dichotomy in the context of the Convention by
attributing to the State responsibility for “private” harm. This shift of public/private has ramifications
for other forms of “treatment” commonly categorised as “private”, such as forced marriage, female
genital mutilation, and serious punishment for transgressing social mores (e.g., Sharia Law). The
majority provided support to include these things as types of harm falling within the Convention, as
opposed to acts that have always been acknowledged as falling within the Convention’s scope (e.g.,
torture, political opinion). Although the decision is arguably not consistent with the growing
recognition of spousal beatings as persecution linked directly to a Convention ground, the approach
provides to be more consistent with the growing recognition of States responsibility to provide
protection to its nationals without discrimination.182
2.3.2. New Zealand: Refugee Appeal No. 71427/99
Several months after the house of Lord decision on Islam; Ex Parte Shah, the Refugee Status Appeals
Authority (RSAA) of New Zealand, issued a decision in a gender claim that involved similar issues,
namely persecution by a private actor (husband) in a country with gender inequality and failed State
protection for women. 183
The applicant, in this case, was a citizen of Iran whose husband was a member of the
Revolutionary Guard.184 The applicant’s husband began to violently abuse her almost immediately
after their arranged marriage and escalated his abuse when she became pregnant.185 After she gave
birth, he arranged for the baby to be taken away from her, and he told her that the child had died.186

He Stated that “there was no reason for her to continue living with him as he did not love her and
there was no baby to look after.”187 He divorced her, and it was only then that the applicant learned
that her child had not, in fact, died.
Her subsequent efforts to obtain access to the child brought her further harassment from
her husband, and from his friends in the Revolutionary Guard. Ultimately, the applicant obtained de
facto custody of the child, which enraged her husband, who considered it as an “embarrassment to
him both as her husband and as an official.”188 After an incident in which the applicant’s ex-husband
beat her mother in an attempt to find the applicant and the child, the applicant, decided to flee Iran.189
About a year before she had made the decision to flee Iran, a childhood friend of the applicant had
proposed marriage. Out of a fear that she would lose the de facto custody of her son, she entered into
a “temporary”190as opposed to “permanent” marriage. Her second husband helped her and her child
to escape and planned to join them afterwards. He was, however, unable to get out of Iran. The
applicant later learned that he had been beaten, arrested, and otherwise harassed by the applicant’s
first husband. Relying upon scholarly sources and human rights reports, the RSAA decision began
with an “overview of the institutionalized and State-sanctioned discrimination against women in the
Iranian family context.”191 The RSAA’s decision noted that in every aspect of marriage, divorce, and
custody, the woman is subservient to the man. Women cannot choose their spouses without the
consent of their father or paternal grandfathers.192 Men can divorce at will, while women can divorce
only upon proof of “undue hardship.”193 Men can have several permanent spouses and unlimited
temporary spouses; women cannot.194 Legal custody of children automatically belongs to the father
and paternal grandfather, although the actual care of the child can be conferred on the mother.195 After
reviewing the inequalities relating to marriage, divorce, and custody rights, the RSAA decision
examined penal provisions, as well as law and policy related to domestic violence. The RSAA
concluded that “gender discrimination is the central feature of the Iranian penal code,”196 and that
“the attitude to domestic violence by the Iranian State is one of condonation, if not complicity.”197
The New Zealand tribunal explicitly followed the formula established in Islam; Ex

Parte Shah198; Persecution = serious harm + failure of State protection. Like Islam; Ex Parte Shah,
the applicant’s husband was a source of serious harm in the form of “physical and psychological
violence,”199 and the State had failed to provide protection. The failure of protection was not only the
result of State inaction but also the State of Iran had “condoned if not actively encouraged, non-state
actors such as husbands and former husbands to cause serious harm to women”200
Similar to the Lords in Islam; Ex Parte Shah201, The tribunal found that the abuse and
harassment by the ex-husband constituted serious harm, but there was no nexus to a Convention
ground. However, the tribunal found nexus with the failure of State protection and Convention ground
(gender social group, political opinion, and religion).202 The reasoning behind the finding was that
the tribunal found that the husband’s actions were not “for reasons of “ one of the Convention
grounds, observing that it would be “artificial” to try fit them within that context in light of the
multiple “causes of violence in the home.”203
The most important distinction between the analysis in the analysis of the New Zealand
tribunal and the analysis of the Lords in Islam; Ex Parte Shah is that the New Zealand tribunal found
that considered cumulatively, the discriminatory measures against women in Iran constituted serious
harm.204 The significance of this finding is that now a woman in Iran under appropriate circumstances
could qualify for refugee status, whether she is subject to spousal abuse or not, the discriminatory
measures against women in Iran itself were sufficient to establish persecution.205
2.3.3. Australia: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v. Khawar
This decision by the High Court of Australia constitutes the third case in the trilogy of decisions
applying bifurcated nexus analysis and affirming that women who are the victims of domestic
violence may qualify for protection under the Convention ground particular social group.
This case concerns a Pakistani asylum seeker, Naima Khawar, who claimed that she
had been physically abused and threatened with death by her husband and members of her husband’s
family.206 She had been hospitalized with injuries from beatings, and threatened by her husband and

his family that she would be disfigured with acid or burned alive.207 On one occasion, her husband
and his brother “doused her with petrol” and only stopped when neighbours intervened.208 Mrs.
Khawar Stated that she had gone to the police on four occasions to report the violence, but the police
never took her complaints seriously or acted on them. When she reported the dousing with petrol
incident, the officer “told her that women always tried to blame their husbands for problems for which
they themselves were the real cause.”209
Mrs. Khawar had submitted “substantial” evidence on the status of women in Pakistan:
the document addressed gender discrimination in the legal system; the existence of widespread
impunity in cases of killing or mutilation of women; and the failure of the police to act in cases of
domestic violence.210 She argued that her persecution was on account of various gender-defined social
groups, including women, married women in Pakistan, married women in Pakistan without the
protection of a male relative, married women in Pakistan suspected of adultery, or women who have
transgressed the social mores of Pakistani society.211
Her claim for protection in Australia was denied in the first instance. When she
appealed to the administrative body, the Refugee Review Tribunal, anonymous sources submitted
information to the Refugee Review Tribunal accusing Ms. Khawar of fabricating her story. This did
not cause the Refugee Review Tribunal to make a credibility determination. The tribunal ruled that
even if the facts were correct, she would be denied refugee status because those alleged perpetrators
(her husband and his family) were not motivated by her membership of any of the proposed particular
social groups. According to the adjudicators the perpetrators were motivated purely by personal
considerations related to the circumstances of her marriage and the fact that she brought dowry to the
family and their dislike of her as an individual.

212

Thus, the Refugee Review Tribunal did not

determine whether Ms. Khawar was a member of a particular social group, or whether in fact there
was a failure of State protection.
When Ms. Khawar appealed to the federal Court, judge Branson ruled that the
Refugee Review tribunal had erred in not deciding on these two issues. He stated that:
“Had the Tribunal made a finding that Mrs. Khawar was a member of a social group in
Pakistan which was comprised of Pakistani women, or alternatively married

Pakistani women, it may well have concluded, as Lord Steyn did in evidence in ...
(Ex-Parte Shah) that:
“Given the central feature of State-tolerated and State-sanctioned gender
discrimination, the argument that the appellants fear persecution not
because of their membership of a particular social group but because of
the hostility of their husband is unrealistic.”213
The decision by judge Branson was upheld by the federal Court following which the government
(the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) sought review of the case in the High
Court of Australia. With the focus solely on the legal issues raised by Ms. Khawar’s claim, the high
Court ruled four to one that a successful claim for protection could be established based on the genderdefined social group in a context of gender discrimination and resultant failed state protection. The
four Justices in the majority (Justices Gleeson, McHugh, Gummow, and Kirby) issued three opinions,
with McHugh and Gummow issuing a joint opinion. In each of the opinions, the Justices Stated that
the relevant social group should simply be “women.”214 Justice Gleeson observed in his opinion that
“women in any society are a distinct and recognizable group.”215 The
Justices did not rule out that the appropriate social group could be defined as “gender+” other
characteristics, which would result in a narrower group.216
With regards to the issue relating to the nexus element, the analysis of the Australian
High Court was strikingly similar to that of the House of Lords and Refugee Status Appeals Authority.
First, the High Court adopted the same bifurcated nexus approach, expressed by the formulation that
“Persecution= Serious Harm + Failure of State Protection” and Stated that on this basis, the nexus
requirement could be met when either the serious harm or failure of State protection is “for reasons
of a Convention ground.”217 Second, alike the other two tribunals, the High Court assumed that the
motivation for the non-state actors (the husband and his family) was not related to Ms. Khawar’s
membership in a gender-defined group, despite the specific formulation.218 Third, the Court was less
than definitive as to the particular test it employed to establish nexus or causation. Justice Kirby’s
opinion commented most extensively on this element. He Stated that although some “singling” out

for a Convention reason is required to establish causation, the motivation or intention for this singling
out need not arrive from enmity or malignant intentions. 219
Finally, the Court referred to the “history and broad humanitarian object of the
Convention”220 in reaching its determination that the bifurcated nexus analysis, which considers
serious harm and failure of State protection, is consistent with the multilateral treaty’s intent.221 Since
the High Court limited its review solely to the legal issues at hand, the high Court did not make a
ruling on Ms. Khawar’s specific claim for protection. The case was remanded back to the
Refugee Review Tribunal to make the required factual finding and apply the articulated framework
to the facts.222
With Khawar Australia stands with the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and
other States that recognise gender violence as grounds for asylum. It provides a strong example and
a way out of the complex issue of the nexus in gender-related asylum claims.

2.3.4. United States: From Matter of Kasinga to Matter of A-BThe Matter of Kasinga223 involved a claim of a young woman from Togo fleeing FGM and forced
polygamy. In a landmark decision, which accepted a gender-defined social group and applied a
bifurcated nexus analysis the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ruled eleven to one to grant
asylum. The decision was a very positive step forward and many advocates and scholars saw the
rationale used in Matter of Kasinga as opening the door to other claims of gender-related persecution,
not just FGM.224
The BIA decided Matter of Kasinga in 1996. In the same year, a Guatemalan woman
named Rody Alvarado applied for asylum protection.225 She was fleeing ten years of brutal domestic
violence by her husband, who was known for killing women and children during Guatemala’s civil

Ibid. para. 91: The Court Stated: “The Convention is one of several important international treaties designed to
redress “violations of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of State protection.” It is this recognition of the
failure of State protection so often repeated in the history of the past hundred years, that led to the exceptional
involvement of international law in matters concerning individual human rights. In that context, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women are
obviously important in expressing the concept of women’s equality before the law and the unacceptability of the State
and its agencies discriminating unjustly against women solely by reason of their sex.”

war.226 Despite the similarities of the cases between Matter of Kasinga and the Matter of R-A-, the
majority of the BIA rejected a gender-defined social group and refused to apply any form of bifurcated
analysis. The BIA’s decision in Matter of R-A- was widely criticized as inconsistent with precedent,
as well as with the developing gender norm, including the immigration and naturalization Service’s
(INS) own guidelines.227 This criticism appeared to be taken seriously by former Attorney General
Janet Reno, who took the unusual step of exercising her authority to review and vacate Matter of RA-228 remanding it back to the BIA to reconsider the case under a set of proposed amendments to the
asylum regulations that had been drafted by the INS and published December 7, in the Federal
Register.207 The case of Rody Alvarado went on for 13 years and she was finally granted asylum in
2009.229 However, the decision was at the level of immigration judge, meaning that it did not
constitute a binding precedent.230 Between the 1999, when the BIA reversed her grant for asylum,
and 2009, when she was finally granted asylum, three separate Attorney Generals intervened in her
case: Janet Reno, John Ashcroft, and Michael Mukasey.231 Their intervention shows the level of
controversy over the concept, not only gender-based asylum, but specifically of domestic violence as
a basis for asylum.232
It was not until August 2014, 18 years after the BIA decided Matter of Kasinga, that the
BIA issued a precedent decision in a Matter of A-R-C-G-,233another case involving domestic violence.
Essentially it was held that victims of domestic violence can qualify for asylum based on their
particular social group of “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their
relationship.”234 However, the victory did not last long, as in 2018 the Trump administration took a
case called Matter of A-B-,235 which raised the same set of issues as Matter of A-R-C-G-, a case
involving domestic violence. The claimant, Ms. A-B-, was a Salvadoran woman who was fleeing
domestic violence. She had been denied asylum by an immigration judge in Charlotte, North
Carolina.236 After her appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the BIA reversed the case
and relied upon Matter of A-R-C-G deciding that Ms. A-B- met the standard of asylum.237 In order to
do a background check before granting her asylum, the BIA remanded the case to the immigration

judge. Unlike planned, the immigration judge refused to grant her asylum, and instead sat on the case.
One reason for this may have been the miscommunication between the Attorney General Jeff Sessions
and the immigration judge. Sessions had used his power to take a decision of the BIA, to take authority
over it, and to issue new decision.238 The decision he issued reversed the grant of asylum to Ms. AB- and vacated Matter of A-R-C-G, the precedent decision which was a result of 18 years of protracted
legal struggle.239
When Attorney General Sessions issued his decision in Matter of A-B-, not only did he
reverse the Matter of A-R-C-G, but he also made some broad Statements such as: “Generally, claims
by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors
will not qualify for asylum.”240 The broad language, which was intended to serve as a blanket
exclusion of these claims, actually plummeted the asylum claims after Matter of A-B-.241Every case
is supposed to be decided on its own merits, and on its own facts. However, these general Statements
made by the Attorney General Sessions sent the message that these cases should be denied. What
Matter of A-B- actually does as a legal matter, is it reverses the decision in A-R-C-G-, and it has some
specific holdings that make it much harder for these domestic violence cases to prevail.242
The development of the jurisprudence in the United States on these key issues has been
somewhat unusual, with issuance of two seemingly inconsistent opinions, Matter of Kasinga243 and
Matter of R-A-,244followed by the intervention of then- Attorney General, Janet Reno, who vacated
the latter of the two. While Matter of Kasinga was praised for opening the door for women’s genderbased claims, 245 the Matter of R-A- and Matter of A-B-, was just roundly condemned for slamming
it shut.246 Even in the wake of the Attorney General’s vacating of the offending Matter of R-Adecision, commentators have characterized the U.S. position on gender claims a being out of step
with evolving jurisprudence and inconsistent with international norms.247While the tribunals in the
United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia have adopted the bifurcated nexus analysis in order to

include the women’s experiences in the refugee discourse, the development of U.S. jurisdiction has
gone backwards. The lack of clear and concise guidelines and ambiguous practice of the decisionmakers, demonstrated in the Matter of A-B-, leaves the women applicants in a disadvantaged position
where the jurisdiction is unpredictable and inconsistent with the development of the rest of the
international community. It is difficult for an individual to challenge the decisions on appeal, and it
provides very little guidance for future applicants with similar claims.
2.4. National Guidelines
While the Refugee Convention provides a definition to a refugee and standards for their protection,
it remains silent about the procedures surrounding the determination of refugee status. UNHCR has
considerable authority when it comes to interpreting the Refugee Convention and the guidelines aim
to provide legal interpretative guidance to governments and officials. In addition, many States accept
direct or indirect participation by UNHCR in procedures for the determination of refugee status.
However, the refugee Convention leaves States the choice of means regarding implementation of the
Convention at the national level. Some countries acknowledge the principle of asylum for refugees
expressly in the constitution, while in other countries the ratification of the Refugee Convention and
Protocol has direct effect in national law. In 1993, UNHCR EXCOM issued a Conclusion248 which
became the catalyst for States to develop guidance on gender asylum for their refugee status
determination procedures. Since then, many States have issued their own national guidelines to help
better understand the gender dimensions of asylum process and for adjudicating gender-related
claims. The Guidelines and administrative features of three seemingly similar legal regimes (Canada,
the United Kingdom and the United States) are briefly introduced in the following subchapters. By
reviewing the way these member states have adopted the guidance of the UNHCR this thesis attempts
to understand better the different interpretations of the refugee definition, and the possible pitfalls
they may propose to women in different regimes.

43

Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines) provide assistance to the decision-makers
in deciding gender-related refugee claims and offer options for procedural accommodations and
analytical guidance in the evaluation of gender-related claims. The Gender Guidelines are organized
in four sections and the first two situate gender-related claims in the context of the refugee definition.
Section A, Determining the Nature and the Grounds for Persecution, addresses how gender-related
harms can qualify as persecution under the 1951 Refugee Convention.250The guideline also
addresses other critical aspects within women’s gender-related refugee claims, namely the issue of
nexus with one or more of the enumerated grounds,251 evidentiary matters, and the special problems
women may face when providing evidence at the hearings. Section B, Assessing the Feared Harm,
focuses on the question of “whether the violence is a serious violation of a fundamental human right
for a Refugee Convention ground result from a failure of state protection.”252 Considering the
framework for analysis, and for the determination of what kinds of treatment are considered
persecution, the guideline encourages decision-makers to rely on an objective standard provided by
international human rights instruments.253
The Canadian guideline treats the particular social group nexus as a default in genderrelated cases. While the guideline only briefly mentions “grounds other than membership in a
particular social group”254 it devotes a whole chapter to the Convention ground “membership in a
particular social group”. Referring to the Supreme Court decision in Ward255 the chapter focuses on
the three authoritative categories of “particular social group” (innate or unchangeable characteristics,
characteristics fundamental to human dignity, and former status). Although the Court in Ward held
that the first category (groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic) would include
individuals fearing persecution on such grounds as gender, linguistic background and sexual
orientation, there has been only few cases where the group has consisted purely of gender alone.256
Further, the Gender Guideline emphasises that women may face persecution as the
consequence of failing to conform to, or for transgressing social mores (i.e., FGM). When considering
Persecution’ (March 1993); Immigrant and Refugee Board Of Canada. ‘Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing

the application of the statutory ground, the guideline encourages the decision-makers to consider
women claiming asylum based on gender-related persecution for reasons of transgression of religious
or social norms under the grounds of religion or political opinion, even though UNHCR Conclusion
no.39 contemplates the use of “particular social group” as an appropriate ground. This deviation from
the views of the UNHCR reminds that the views of the UNHCR are merely suggestions, and not
binding on States. Moreover, this specific note provides a welcome acknowledgement to actions of
women as political and taking place in the public sphere instead in the private.
2.4.2. The United Kingdom
In 1998, the UK Gender Guidelines for the Determination of Asylum Claims in the UK addressed to
first instance decision-makers in the Home Office.257 On 5 December 2000, the United Kingdom
Immigration Appellate Authority (the immigration and asylum tribunal) launched its Asylum Gender
Guidelines,258 for the use in the determination of asylum appeals in the UK. The aim of the guideline
is to assist the judiciary at the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) in fully considering all aspects
of asylum seekers’ claims to international refugee protection. The guideline acknowledges that
traditionally it has been viewed that a ‘real refugee’ is a man and therefore women asylum seekers in
the UK may not benefit equitably from the protection offered by the Refugee Convention. The reasons
for this are twofold: first, the case law has not fully considered the specific issues raised by women’s
needs for protection or has considered them from a framework of male experiences. Two, procedural
and evidential requirements of the asylum status determination procedures may not be equally
accessible to women as men.259 In addition to the UN Guidelines, the UK guideline draws from other
national guidelines and forms a comprehensive collection for the decision-makers.
2.4.3. The United States
Even within jurisdictions the adjudicators adopt conflicting interpretations.260 There has been two
distinct lines of analysis for ‘particular social group’ cases in the United States due to the peculiar
administrative structure of the American system.261 Asylum cases are heard by the USCIS asylum

officers, and if not granted, they may be raised before immigration judges in a removal proceeding
and then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals located within the Department of Justice.
From the BIA the decisions may be appealed to a federal circuit court of appeals.262 These decisions
by the court of appeals are binding on the BIA. The reason this administrative system is introduced
here, is that the Ninth Circuit263 hears considerably more asylum cases than any other circuit.
Therefore, its decisions play a crucial role in the development of asylum law in the United States.264
The B.I.A. and the Ninth Circuit have construed different interpretations of ‘particular social
group’. The other federal circuit courts of appeals have largely adopted the B.I.A.’s approach.265 Thus
there is a different standard for cases brought in the Ninth Circuit and cases heard by the B.I.A. and
appealed to other circuit courts.266 There has been attempts to unify the practice, and in 1995, the
former United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) provided guidelines concerning
asylum claims of women.267 Although the Immigration Judges’, the BIA and the Circuit Courts could
have taken note of these considerations, the non-binding document was directed at to asylum officers,
who form the first tier of decision-making in the United States system.268 The considerations refer to
the significant developments which preceded their issuance and cite the UNHCR document as well
as the Canadian Guidelines. The guideline acknowledges the importance of human rights informed
approach and analyzing gender claims within “the framework provided by the existing international
human rights instruments.”269 Like the Canadian guideline, the considerations provide examples of
gendered harms that could constitute persecution,270 and identify the “nexus issues” as one of the
most difficult issues arising in gender claims.271 The focus in the considerations was on ‘political
opinion’ and ‘particular social group’ as possible grounds for gender claims.

changes when March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist under that name. Most of the agency’s functions were transferred
to three new entities- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE),
and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The USCIS processes asylum and refugee applications and makes adjudicative
decisions performed at the service centers. The Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate (RAIO)
working under the USCIS is responsible for the adjudication of asylum and refugee applications.

Since the groundbreaking decision in Matter of R-A-272there has been attempts to further
clarify issues relating to the refugee definition, particularly regarding the membership in a particular
social group. Since 2019 the RAIO has provided a very comprehensive training module for its officers
on gender-related claims and factors they must take into consideration when interviewing and
adjudicating claims related to gender.273 Again, the training was directed at the officers of the first
tier of the proceedings rather than the IJ’s, BIA or the Circuit Courts.
As demonstrated by the cases Matter of Kasinga,274 Matter of R-A-,275 Matter of A-R-CG-,276 and Matter of A-B-277 in chapter 2.4.3. of this thesis, the policy positions and absence of clear
national guidance has resulted in contradictory and arbitrary outcomes and the failure of protection.278
After the decision of A-B- came out the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued
guidance about how these cases should be denied.279 Arguably the Matter of A-B- and the USCIS
Guidance were being applied as a blanket preclusion of cases involving domestic violence or fear of
gangs in the expedited removal process. The holdings of Matter of A-B-, and the aspects of the USCIS
guidance have been criticized to be unlawful.280
The division within the United States asylum system and the two differing standards
prove to pose additional challenges for women asylum seekers. The BIA’s approach relies upon the
protected characteristics approach from Acosta281 while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has relied
upon the ‘cohesiveness’ requirement from Sanchez-Trujillo282. Thus, depending on the instance
adjudicating the case, the outcomes tend to vary.

In 2011, an Australian study found that even years after the implementation of the gender guidelines,
there is a lack of systematic and consistent application of the guidelines.283 According to the
researchers the mere fact that the guidelines existed led some decision-makers to conclude that the
“gender issue” was taken care of. At the same time there was clear evidence that gender-related
claims were not given fair consideration by decision-makers.284 Some Canadian Scholars also raise
concerns that gender-related aspects of claims may be either misunderstood by some decisionmakers or discounted in comparison to other Convention grounds.285 Moreover, the United
Kingdom’s asylum system has some identified issues of inconsistent treatment by decision-makers
in gender-related claims. In 2011, the United Kingdom advocacy group Asylum Aid, studied the
way the UK Border Agency officials (UKBA) analysed the cases of women refugee claimants.286
The researchers found that the UK decision-makers in the study sample287 had a poor understanding
of the nature of gender-based persecution. In addition, the decision-makers did not use available
resources, such as government-produces country reports, to help augment their understanding of the
issue.288 These studies demonstrate the issue that, although the national Gender Guidelines provide
an array of possible gender-related claims, the decision-makers have the tendency to dismiss the
intersectional nature of women’s oppression. The narrow understanding of gender arguably
endangers the fair and equitable evaluation for all gender-related claims as the decision-makers
interpret the notion of gender too narrow.289

3. Funnelling Women’s Claims Under the ‘Particular Social Group’ Nexus
There has been a steady increase in women’s refugee claims based on ”membership in a particular
social group” within the past 20 years. The ambiguity of ’particular social group’ nexus makes it a
flexible vehicle for women’s claims that may not easily fit within other Convention grounds. In many
jurisdictions, it has become the default ground for women’s claims, although one or more of the other

grounds may be equally or more applicable.290 The adjudicators have adopted a range of construction
of the Convention language to fulfil the gaps of the interpretative materials provided by the
UNCHR.291 The balancing act between providing protection to victims of persecutions and respecting
state sovereignty without imposing obligations that they do not consent, has made ’particular social
group’ a vexing category. In other words, time to time Courts and administrative agencies may
introduce a standard that adequately resolves the case before them only to later conclude that the rule
must be modified because of subsequent claims.292
Scholars, such as Bosi and Chan, argue that the absence of any clear academic or legal
definition of what constitutes a particular social group makes it a “theoretically vexing category,”293
whose definition is “ambiguous, narrow and contrived.”294 Moreover, according to Bosi, the strategy
of evoking a particular social group nexus in order to frame gender-related claims has “created an
often mechanistic and reductive classification problem by creating artificial subcategories that are
arbitrarily either denied or granted asylum.”295 Furthermore, Tvedt, emphasises that the main issue
with funnelling women’s claims for refugee under the particular social group nexus ground leaves
intolerable room to adjudicators to apply interpretations that exclude women’s experiences. This view
has been supported by Schenk, who has voiced his concerns with regards the problematic nature of
the particular social group ground, which runs the risk of either excluding gender-related groups
through a too narrow definition on the other hand, or “subsuming the entire framework of asylum
law” on the other, rendering the remaining grounds superfluous.296 On the contrary, some scholars,
such as Bahl, argues that the interpretation of persecution that recognises violence against women as
grounds for asylum in addition to an understanding that women can constitute particular social group
within the meaning of the Convention, are necessary in order to include women claimants. She says
that “the present legislation, both in the United States and internationally, can only accommodate
these claims within the existing infrastructure.”297
The arbitrariness of Courts accepting various gender-related groups as particular social
group makes this strategy an unpredictable one.298Funnelling women’s claims under the particular

social group nexus requires a balancing act between excluding gender-related groups through too
narrow definition on the other hand and too inclusive on the other. The danger with the latter one
being, that it would finally render the other grounds superfluous. To better understand why the
“particular social group” nexus is used as a default for women’s gender-related refugee claims, this
chapter provides an overview of the Convention ground and means to include gender to the discourse.
3.1. Defining ‘Particular Social Group’
The absence of any clear academic or legal definition of what constitutes a particular social group
was noted by the UNHCR in 2002, when as a part of its process of Global Consultations,299it issued
guidelines on both membership in a particular social group300 and gender-related persecution.301 the
Guidelines are significant for affirming gender-defined social group and expressly adopting the
bifurcated nexus analysis introduced in chapter 2.3. The Guidelines overlap in their areas of coverage
and are mutually reinforcing. The Social Group Guidelines recommend and expand the definition of
social group, incorporating the following two principal approaches adopted for example by the State
tribunals in Australia,302 Canada,303 and the United States304:
(1) The “Protected characteristic approach,” which recognises groups united by immutable
and fundamental characteristics.
(2) The “social perception” approach, which recognises groups perceived by society as being
cognizable group.
In order to properly understand the nature of these two principal approaches, the following
subchapters of this thesis assess protected characteristics approach (ejusdem generis) and the social
perception approach in more detail. It shall do so by examining the practice of the tribunals of the
United States, Canada.
3.1.1. Protected Characteristic Approach (ejusdem generis)

299

The Global Consultations marked the fiftieth anniversary of the drafting of the U.N. Refugee Convention and included
a process of research and dialogue regarding key aspects of the refugee definition and contemporary refugee issues.

First adopted by the United States Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in Matter of Acosta305, the
protected characteristic approach has become the leading approach in the common law realm.306 The
formulation stems from the well-established doctrine of ejusdem generis which is used to interpret
generally written statutes. Where law lists specific classes of persons for example, and then refers to
them in general, the general Statements only apply to the same kinds of persons or things specifically
listed.307 In Matter of Acosta the BIA emphasised that “persecution that is directed toward an
individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable
characteristic. The shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex, colour or kinship ties, or
in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land
ownership…Whatever the common characteristic that defines the group, it must be one that the
members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is
fundamental to their individual identities or conscience.”308 Thus, the approach examines whether a
group is united by an immutable characteristic or a characteristic that is so fundamental to human
dignity that a person should not be compelled to forsake it. 309
This approach was also adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ward.310 In this case the
Court went further in its analysis, exploring the objectives of the Convention’s drafters. The
Supreme Court of Canada found that underlying the Convention is the international community’s
commitment to the assurance of basic human rights without discrimination.311 The Convention
drafters included race, religion, nationality, and political opinion because they constituted clear
examples of status and beliefs deserving protection under international norms of nondiscrimination.312 The particular social group ground should, therefore, be interpreted to embrace
groups similar to the other four specifically Stated categories, and to reflect the non-discriminatory
principle.313 The Supreme Court of Canada in Ward defined three authoritative categories of
“particular social group” concept, namely:

of individuals and groups, which are considered worthy of special protection. These same factors have figured in the
development of the fundamental principle of non-discrimination in general international law, and have contributed to the
formulation of other fundamental human rights”

1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;
2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their
human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical
permanence.314
The Canadian Supreme Court further elucidated the categories in Ward stating that “The first
category (innate or unchangeable characteristics) would embrace individuals fearing persecution on
such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second (characteristic
fundamental to human dignity) would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third
branch (former status) is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant
to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one’s past is an immutable part of the person.”315 By this
definition, “groups defined by a characteristic which is changeable or from which disassociation is
possible, so long as neither option requires renunciation of basic human rights”316 are excluded from
the protected characteristics approach.
Adopting the ejusdem generis approach provides “a firmly principled framework, with the
determination of whether a group qualifies as a “particular social group” being made on the basis of
the same kinds of non-discrimination concerns that underpin the other four Convention grounds”.317
It also “promotes consistency in decision-making, because it relies on clear external standards of
reference which are of universal applicability; allows for the automatic, responsible evolution of the
particular social group category, since the norms by which qualification is assessed are continually
adjusted through the State-sanctioned human rights law-making process.”318 Moreover, it has
provided the basis for important decisions extending protection to such groups as women and
homosexuals. Whether women can constitute a particular social group based on their gender was
confirmed by the UNHCR in its Gender Guidelines which State that “It follows that sex can properly
be within the ambit of the social group category, with women being a clear example of social subset
defined by innate and immutable characteristic.”319

3.1.1.1. Cohesion Requirement
The ejusdem generis framework has been widely accepted by the member states and the UNHCR.
However, it has also been criticised to unnecessarily complicate the refugee inquiry in a way that
could be avoided by simply giving the phrase its ordinary meaning. The interpretive challenges were
demonstrated in the United States case of Sanchez-Trujillo v. I.N.S320, which concerned two men,
Sanchez and Escobar. The threshold question in this case was whether the petitioners’ class of young,
urban, working class males constitutes that type of “particular social group,” membership in which
should be regarded as indicative of refugee status under the applicable immigration statutes.321The
Immigration Judge held, that such a large division of the population could not constitute a cognizable
“social group” within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. Sections 1101(a)(42), 1253(h) and that “mere group
membership, without evidence of persecution directed at the individual petitioner, was not sufficient
to maintain a claim for asylum or prohibition of deportation.”322
The court developed a four-part test for evaluating a social group claim which, if used
in a balanced fashion, is capable of producing a fair result. First, the distinguishability of the group
had to be established. Second, petitioners needed to show they were members of that group. Third,
the group in question must have been the target of persecution on account of its characters. Finally,
the court had to determine if “special circumstances” existed which warranted granting asylum on
the basis of social group membership alone.323The court focused on the first part of the test
(distinguishability of the group) and disposed the case on that basis.324 Although the court looked to
the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, for a definition
of “particular social group” it did not find the Handbook’s discussion helpful.325 Ultimately the court
relied upon its own interpretation of the statutory language,326 finding that “the phrase “particular
social group” implies a collection of people closely affiliated with each other, who are actuated by
some common impulse or interest. Of central concern is the existence of voluntary associational
relationship among the purported member, which imparts some common characteristic that is
fundamental to their identity.”327 Thus, the Court held that a voluntary associational relationship
between group members, rather than innate or fundamental characteristics, was necessary to establish

a particular social group. According to the court’s example immediate family members provided a
“prototypical example” of a particular social group, which consists of people voluntary associated to
each other. In contrast a “statistical group” such as “males over six feet tall” would not qualify as a
particular social group even if it experienced greater general risk of persecution.328 The court
concluded that the social group defined by the petitioners in this case was closer to the “statistical
group” and went no further in its analysis.329
The approach arising from Sanchez-Trujillo, also known as “cohesion”, requirement
has been rejected in number of tribunals.330 Arguably the courts use of the test was not balanced and
in determining cognizability of the social group the standard used by the court was overly narrow.
While the requirement of close affiliation and common interest together may imply voluntary
associational relationship, it also suggests a much broader type of group than an individual family,
which the court brought up as an example. Based on this criterion the people who belong to
associations (e.g., Zonta International) who have a voluntary associational relationship would amount
to a particular social group. However, at the same time it is far from the prototype given by the court
(family). The conflict creates confusion and thus fails to achieve what the court ought to do- provide
a clear and rational outcome. Furthermore, rather than utilizing other sources in defining the term
“particular social group” the court relied on the ambiguity of the words “social group” to achieve its
result. The court used no citations and arrived at a definition based on what it interpreted to be the
plain meaning of the words.331 The “plain meaning” definition could also have implied a broader
group than outlined by the court in this case. Were the court to turn to international sources such as
the travaux preparatoires of the Refugee Convention and Protocol, cases from other countries party
to the Refugee Convention, or the UNHCR Handbook, there could have been much more needed
depth to the analysis of the meaning of “particular social group”.
As the cohesion framework requires knowledge of non-discrimination and related areas
of human rights law, it may pose challenges when applying. It is possible that some of the concerns
relating to non-discrimination and other human rights principles have not come up for adjudication
within the human rights system and thus may force the decision-makers to defer to a standard that
may not exist. There is no predictability as to whether women facing gender-related violence would
fall into the category of particular social group if the cohesion requirement were to be applied.

3.1.2. Social Perception Approach
The social perception, also known as the sociological approach, focuses on the external perception of
a given group in the context of the country of origin. It asks whether or not a group shares a common
characteristic which makes them cognizable group or sets them apart from society at large.332The aim
of the concept is to give ordinary meaning to the concept and define a “particular social group” for
the purposes of refugee law on sociological basis.333
In Applicant A v. MIMA334 the High Court of Australia took the view that the phrase
“membership of a particular social group” should be given a broad interpretation to “encompass all
those who fall fairly within its language and should be construed in light of the context in which it
appears”335 and emphasized that exhaustive definition of the phrase would not only be impossible,
but also pointless.336 In the case Dawson J explained:
“A “group” is a collection of persons (...) the word “social” is of wide import and may
be defined to mean “pertaining, relating, or due to (...) society as a natural or ordinary
condition of human life”. “Social” may also be defined as “capable of being associated
or united to others” or “associated, allied, combined”. The adjoining of
“social” to “group” suggests that the collection of persons must be of a social character,
that is to say, the collection must be cognizable as a group in society such that its
members share something which unites them and sets them apart from society at large.
The word “particular” in the definition merely indicates that there must be an
identifiable social group such that a group can be pointed to as a particular social group.
A particular social group, therefore, is a collection of persons who share a certain
characteristic or element which unites them and enables them to be set apart from
society at large.”337
This approach places the significance upon the external perception of the group, including the
perception of the persecutors.338 McHugh J. in his concurring judgment emphasised that the
“existence of such a group depends in most, perhaps all, cases on external perceptions of the group’,
and that the group ‘must be identifiable as a social unit.”339 Thus, the question is whether the group

is perceived by people in the country of origin as a distinct social group “by reason of some
characteristic attribute, activity, belief, interest or goal that unites them.”340
The meaning of ‘social perception’ approach was further explored by the High Court in
Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs341 where the Court established three
steps in determining whether group is a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention:
“First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all
members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members
of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that
characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large.”342
Although the Court demonstrated in Applicant S that there is no pre-requisite that society should
recognise or perceive the existence of a particular social group for it to exist,343 it did elaborate on the
third requirement. The question is whether the group is objectively cognizable,344or distinguished
from the relevant society at large, with evidence of societal perception being highly relevant, indeed
‘usually compelling’,345in this inquiry. From evidentiary perspective the test could be satisfied by
drawing information from the usual source of fact-finding in refugee hearing, namely from “countryinformation” gathered by international bodies and Nations other than the applicant’s nation of
origin.346
The social perception approach has been praised for the fact that it stems from the words
“membership of a particular social group” and needs no references to external legal standards; it takes
a pragmatic approach in the recognition of the absence of completely settled and authoritative set of
external standards of reference; it provides wider judicial discretion than ejusdem generis approach,
allowing judges to consider the political and cultural realities in the applicant’s country of origin; and
because it is so open-ended there is a possibility that it will embrace more groups as “particular social
group” (especially groups in which membership is voluntary and the purpose of which cannot be
readily linked to non-discrimination or other human rights principles). 347
However, as there is no “ordinary meaning” of the concept of “membership of a

particular social group” it seems illogical to defer to such notion. In addition, the test has been
criticised to be overly broad. The New Zealand RSAA emphasised that: “the difficulty with the
“objective observer” approach is that it enlarges the social group category to an almost meaningless
degree. That is, by making societal attitudes determinative of the existence of the social group,
virtually any group of persons in a society perceived as a group could be said to be a particular social
group. The Refugee Convention, however, was not intended to afford protection to every such
persecuted group. Furthermore, the decision-makers may face evidential difficulty in assessing the
“societal perceptions” of other societies, especially those differing from their own societies. Thus,
the social perception test in practice amounts to little more than “licence for subjective assessment of
merit. 348
Jurisdictions applying the social perception test and those relying predominantly on the
protected characteristics approach have acknowledged that women can constitute particular social
group under the 1951 Convention.349 Many jurisdictions have included gender or sex as explicit
ground for refugee status in domestic legislation, including some European jurisdictions. The
European Qualification Directive States that “gender-related aspects might be considered, without by
themselves alone creating a presumption for the applicability of this Article.”350 While in many cases
the selection of one test over another makes no difference to the outcome of an individual refugee
status determination, there are some situations where the choice of test will be determinate.351
Notably, under the UNHCR Guidelines, there is a clear implication that “social perception” is more
positive to lead to the recognition of refugee status than the “protected characteristics”
approach.352The question remains, whether the outcome depends on the tests applied cumulatively or
separately and whether some jurisdictions provide more exclusive protection than others?
Although the cases discussed in this thesis have primarily relied upon the protected characteristics
approach, the Guidelines observe that a number of States have recognised women as constituting a
particular social group under the protected characteristics and social perception approaches.353 The
standard resulting from a merger of the protected characteristics and social perception approach has
been articulated by the Guidelines as follows:

“A particular social group is a group of persons who share a common characteristic
other than their risk of being persecuted, or who are perceived as a group by society.
The characteristic will often be one which innate, unchangeable, or which is otherwise
fundamental to identity, conscience or the exercise of one’s human rights.”354
Noted by the Guidelines, women meet the social group definition because of their “innate and
immutable characteristics” and because of the fact that in society women are “frequently treated
differently than men.”355 The Guidelines expressly State that the size of the group is not a relevant
criterion,356 and reject the “cohesion” requirement arising from the Sanchez-Trujillo357 decision.
Moreover, the Guidelines State that “women may constitute a particular social group under certain
circumstances based on the common characteristic of sex, whether or not they associate with one
another based on that shared characteristic.”358
The Guidelines on Gender-Related Persecution recognise that, although any of the five
enumerated grounds may be implicated to women’s claims, women’s claims often come within the
social group ground “making proper understanding of this term paramount importance.”359
Furthermore the Gender Guidelines expressly adopt the standard established in the social Group
Guidelines, reiterating its applicability to women.360 Both of the Guidelines repudiate factors relied
upon to negate gender-defined social groups, such as the size of the group and the requirement of
cohesiveness or voluntary association.361
3.2. EASO Guidance on membership of a particular social group
The mission of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) is to support European Union Member
States and Associated Countries (Member States) through common training, common quality
standards and common country-of-origin information, among other things. Therefore, it has
developed common practical tools and guidance. The purpose of the EASO Practical Guide on
Qualification for International Protection is to provide guidance to provide further assistance in
applying the reason for persecution of ‘membership of a particular social group’, and more generally

in applying same legal criteria and common standards when determining who qualifies for
international protection.362 Although the guide is only a soft convergence tool, and not legally
binding, it does offer basis for more unified practice and language in the context of Common
European Asylum System (CEAS).
Article 10(1)(d) of the Qualification Directive (QD) provides that a group shall be
considered to form a particular social group where the members of the group share an innate
characteristic, or a common background that cannot be changed, or share a characteristics or belief
that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person should not be forced to renounce it.
Furthermore, where a group has a distinct identity in the relevant country, because it is perceived as
being different by the surrounding society, it shall be considered to form a particular social group.363
This cumulative approach requires that the two criteria, namely ‘common characteristics’ and
‘distinct identity’, both need to be met in order to establish belonging to a particular social group.
Thus, it is not sufficient alone that the group share certain characteristics or background beliefs, but
it must also be visible to others to identify the group as being different.364 Although the surrounding
society should have some general awareness that a particular group exists among society and
perceives its members differently, an individual who is a member of a particular social group can be
‘invisible’ or ‘unnoticeable’ by the surrounding society. The mere fact of sharing the common
characteristics of that particular social group may make him or her a member of that group. For
example, a victim of harmful traditional practices (FGM) may conceal the harm from the
surrounding society. However, sharing the common characteristics with other young women in the
area may make her a member of that group. There is no need for cohesiveness among the members
of the group, nor need they be connected in any way.365 In addition, the size of the group is irrelevant,
when assessing the existence of a particular social group.
The EASO Guide acknowledges that there is a need for a common concept of
persecution ground ‘membership of a particular social group’ which takes into account issues arising
from applicants’ gender (including gender identity and sexual orientation), that may arise from
certain legal traditions and customs, resulting for example FGM, forced sterilization or forced

inter alia take the form of:(...) acts of gender-specific or child specific nature”.367
Like in other guidelines assessed in this thesis, the EASO guide also emphasises that
a mere existence of a discriminatory law or practice in itself is not sufficient to establish a persecution
based on a gender-defined particular social group. However, it may indicate that there is a need to
further assess these gender-based discriminatory practices in the country of origin and see how it is
being applied and how does it affect women differently.368 Often other characteristics will be needed
to establish the criterion of ‘distinct identity’ such as region of origin, ethnicity and social situation.
The guide requires applicant to establish the ‘protected characteristics’ test and the
‘social perception’ test cumulatively. According to the guide, depending on the context in the
concerned country of origin, a particular social group can be established when the women and girls
share the common characteristics. The characteristics can be either innate characteristics (age,
gender, ethnicity), common background, and a characteristic of belief that is fundamental to one’s
identity or conscience. This type of gender-related particular social groups include for example
women and girls who refuse to undergo FGM, women who have been victims of rape or other forms
of sexual violence and who face stigmatisation by surrounding society, or women who were formerly
prostitutes and who face ostracism or other forms of discrimination, punishment or ill-treatment.
Moreover, in addition to sharing common characteristics the ‘distinct identity’ aspect requires that
the group has a distinct identity in the relevant country of origin and that it is perceived differently
by the surrounding society (‘social perception’ test). For example, in some countries women who
have not undergone FGM might be considered different from females who have undergone the
practice, resulting in social ostracism.369 This type of ostracism or severe forms of discrimination
may be enough to establish nexus between the particular social group ground and well-founded fear
of persecution, or an absence of protection against such persecution.
Already at the draft stage, the guide and its cumulative approach have been criticised
due to the requirement of both the ‘protected characteristics’ test and the ‘social perception’ test.
Hathaway has argued that this unfortunate formulation may be related to a misunderstanding of the
UNHCR social group guidelines, which does not apply a ‘cumulative approach’ by any means.

Such ostracism may arise from the fact that these women are perceived as ’unclean’ or ’morally questionable’ by
their local community. This may even be demonstrated by the men in this society who refuse to marry a woman who
has not undergone FGM.

60

Arguably this misconception of the UNHCR Social Group Guidelines and the current text
particularly in relation to gender-based groups, represents a standard lower than the existing standard
in the national laws of some EU member States. As a result, groups defined by sexual orientation or
gender are no longer recognised as clear examples of particular social groups but may qualify only
depending on the circumstances in the country of origin. 370

4. Gender and Political Opinion Nexus
Early decisions had the tendency to view gender-specific claims of women within the “particular
social group” ground, due to the failure of decision-makers to recognise actions of women as
political.371 The acts of women such as transgression of social customs, or young women refusing to
undergo female genital mutilation, are still not recognised as political dissidents, although they are
acting to break the fundamental customs in their society.
Although there have been subsequent judgments that have found that gender-related
persecution can be characterized as racial, ethnic, or political in nature, or in combination of one or
more of these grounds, the decision-makers more consistently rely on the “social group” ground.372
As seen in the cases reviewed in this thesis, sometimes claimants attempt to raise “political opinion”
or “religion” as a valid ground for asylum, yet decisions rarely analyse them in depth. As important
as the “social group” ground is to gender-related claims, a full application of the refugee definition
requires an all-encompassing and equal utilization of the other Convention grounds
4.1. Defining ‘Political Opinion’
The UNHCR guidelines on gender-related persecution voice that political opinion must be understood
in the broad sense, to “incorporate any opinion on any matter in which the machinery of State,
government, society, or policy may be engaged.”373 Such opinions may include an opinion relating
to gender roles as well as non-conformist behavior leading the persecutor to impute a political opinion
to the person concerned. Furthermore, the guidelines emphasize that it depends on the context of the
case, whether an opinion or activity is political in nature. In general, a claim for refugee status on the

61

basis of political opinion nexus requires the claimant to hold or be assumed of holding opinions not
tolerated by the authorities or society which are critical of their traditions, policies or methods.374In
short, the meaning of “political opinion” can be defined to include “opinions contrary to or critical of
the policies of the government or ruling party.”375
This view has been challenged by Goodwin-Gill, who supports a broader definition of
“any opinion on any matter in which the machinery of State, government, and policy may be
engaged.”376Based on the UNHCR definitions, for example, a young girl from Togo, refusing to be
subject to harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation, imposed on her by her
family, community, or village leaders, would struggle to demonstrate that she was expressing
“political opinion” of dissent or opposition to the machinery of State, government, or policy.377
However, even the Goodwin-Gill’s broader definition requires that the “State, government, or policy”
be engaged in order to see a particular opinion or action as “political”.
Edwards proposes even wider definition and posits that the concept of ‘political
opinion’ should apply to any thought, opinion, action, or inaction that can be seen as questioning or
opposing the views of authority or society in large, whatever the type of authority in place.378 By
authority, she means “any form of authority that has the power to impose laws or social rules, or to
punish or discriminate against those refusing to participate in accepted social or cultural practices or
rites, including tribal leaders, and village chiefs.”379 This definition of authority provides a more
inclusive insight to the multiple forms of societies and cultures we live in and to the power structures
that define women’s role in a community. However, jurisprudence in Western countries often fail to
see such practices as political in nature due to its inherent bias towards non-Western political
structures, and has thus, ignored the political apparatus in non-Western countries. Furthermore,
Edwards argues that the definition given to ‘political opinion’, as with the refugee definition, “need
to be individualized to take account of the situation in different countries of origin.”380 This is
especially true in countries, where the authority devolves to regional or village levels,381 or where
women otherwise face oppressive and discriminatory practices. When interpreting the term
“political” it would seem correct to examine the context in which the human rights abuse or
persecution took place. 382

Although the ‘political opinion’ nexus would accurately reflect the reality of a
woman’s gender-related claim, often the case tends to be funneled under the particular social group
nexus. Arguably the issue lies not in the definition of the “political opinion” ground, but in the
acknowledgement of women’s activities and the gendered means of persecution as political. In some
societies women are less likely to directly involve in political activities, rather they may be involved
in political activities that reflect dominant gender roles (i.e., nursing or cooking for rebel soldiers,
communications and public relations). If the activities of women themselves are not recognised as
political, women may be targeted because of the political activities of their husband or family.383
Another reason for dismissing women’s gender-related asylum claims falling under the political
opinion nexus is arguably the overuse of the particular social group ground, which has become an
all-encompassing ground for women’s asylum claims.

4.2. Actual and Imputed Political Opinion
Scholars, such as Heaven Crawley have emphasized that “nowhere are the effects of the
public/private dichotomy on the understanding of women’s experiences more evident…than with
regard to the concept of “politics””.384 This has been demonstrated by cases such as Matter of R-A385

where the applicant, Ms. Rodi Alvarado Pena applied for refugee status under the particular social

group and political opinion nexus. In the UNHCR advisory opinion386 the Attorney General deemed
the political opinion ground relevant in the case and voiced that “Political opinion should be
understood in the broad sense, to incorporate any opinion or any matter in which the machinery of
State, government, society, or policy may be engaged.”387 He further clarified that this matter may
include opinion as to gender roles.388 A claim on the basis of political opinion ( gender roles), would
presuppose that the opinions held by the claimant are not tolerated by the authorities or society, which
are critical of their policies, traditions or methods. The authorities or relevant parts of the society
ought to be aware of these opinions. However, the claimant is not required to directly express her
opinion, nor is she required to have already suffered from any form of discrimination or

persecution.389 When Ms. Alvarado sought help against the abuse by her husband the local authorities
criticised her for complaining and protesting. Thus, Ms. Alvarado’s responses to her husband’s
attempts to dominate and abuse her could be seen as transgression of social mores. In conclusion, the
UNHCR held that Ms. Alvarado should be recognised as a refugee under the particular social group
and political opinion ground.390
Ms. Alvarado’s case in an ample example of dismissing the actions of women as
political. Here, Ms. Alvarado had actively rebelled against the social norms where women were to
obey their husbands and submit to subordinate role. However, her attempts to transgress the social
mores was not seen as political by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In their two-step analysis the
majority held that Ms. Alvarado did not hold a political opinion, but only “the common human desire
not to be harmed or abused” which did not qualify as a political opinion. 391 Moreover, the majority
did not find nexus between the persecution Ms. Alvarado faced or the failure of State protection. The
dissent cited a plethora of cases and asserted that “opposition to male domination and violence against
women, and support for gender equity, constitutes a political opinion.”392 While the majority argued
that Ms. Alvarado’s husband’s action was not in any ways motivated by his wife’s actual or imputed
political opinion, the dissent found that the husband’s escalating abuse was a demonstration of his
increasing attempts to “stifle and overcome”. Although the initial motivation for persecutory actions
were not to punish Ms. Alvarado Pena for her resistance, that became his motivation as the time
passed.393
Gendered roles, beliefs, and attitudes can shape the forms and impact of political
violence, even if the perpetrators are not centrally motivated by preserving hegemonic men’s control
or political power. However, it might be difficult to prove, that the actions taken by the perpetrators
are motivated by the political opinion of the woman or an imputed political opinion of the woman.
For example, in Canadian case Kaur, Biba v. Canada

394

a woman, who was a member of the

Democratic Action Party (DAP), had been detained multiple times because of her participation in
the DAP. In April 1989 she was detained, raped and severely beaten by three or four policemen. The
Refugee Division concluded that the rape was a “random act of violence with no nexus to the
Convention Refugee definition.” However, the Court held that this view was mistaken, as the
evidence showed that the claimant had been detained due to her participation in the DAP and had

been actively sought by the police in number of activities. The claimant had been questioned about
her political activities and raped while detained. Thus, the rape “was a direct consequence of her
detention for political reasons” and the application of political opinion nexus was allowed.395 Had
the rape happened without reference to any demonstrations or political activities, there would not
have been a nexus between the political opinion and the persecution.
It is important not to disregard the political dimensions of a woman’s experiences of
persecution even if a woman is not regarding herself as making a political statement. Nonconforming behaviour or opinions may be seen as expression of a political opinion or lead to a
woman having political opinion attributed to her. Arguably, mainstreaming women’s claims only to
“particular social group” ground excludes the women’s experiences from becoming “public” or
“political”. At the same time, it strengthens the practice of using “particular social group” as allencompassing and unpredictable ground.

5. Gender-Sensitive Interpretation or Textual Addition
Considering that Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifically prohibits
discrimination on the grounds of “sex” or “gender”, it may be questioned why gender is not added to
the refugee Convention as a ground of its own. Although the existing guidelines provide for legal
interpretive guidance, inconsistencies continue to occur, with unfavourable outcomes for women.305
The feminist engagement has provided multiple perspectives as to how to include women’s
experiences in the refugee discourse. Within the literature reviewed for the purposes of this thesis,
however, two diverging approaches emerge. On the one hand, some scholars and activist argue that
the refugee definition, as it appears in the Convention, can and should be interpreted in new and
creative ways in order to ensure proper gender sensitivity in the ways we understand the conditions
of an asylum claim (Gender-sensitive interpretation). On the other hand, scholars also hold that
women’s point of view can only be sufficiently incorporated through modification of the language
and definition itself, mainly in the form of adding gender as an additional sixth enumerated ground
for persecution (textual addition).396
Some proponents for the textual addition argue that only by adding gender as a sixth

395

CRDD decision U93-02012, August 13, 1993.
Ibid. p. 38.

65

enumerated ground to the Convention can the built-in male bias existing in law be redressed.397 Chan
argues that the lack of such a category subjects women claimants to a higher burden of proof, as their
gender-related claims must be brought and formulated “through” one of the five existing groundseven in cases where the claimants were abused solely on the basis of their gender. Indeed, some
proponents for a freestanding gender nexus argue that without gender as a separate category, women
are forced to classify and formulate their claims based on ‘political opinion’, ‘particular social group’,
or other existing Convention grounds, which in turn downplays or misrepresents the gender
component of their claim.398
Furthermore, Greatbatch argues that simply adding gender nexus would not amend the
interpretive challenges involved in determining refugee status.399 According to her, this strategy
“assumes consensus on the nature of gender-based persecution.”400 As women’s experiences of
persecution are not homogenous, but rather affected by the power relations between men and women
in the country of origin, the implications of these relations for women’s identity, status, roles and
responsibilities, inter-relationships of various “social divisions” (such as gender, class, sexual
orientation, race, and physical ability) and other factors that intersect and form unique identities, it
would be extremely difficult to remove the interpretative aspect from women’s claims inconsistency
that arises from interpretation, as the claims would still require interpretative practice.401 Furthermore,
scholars such as Haines, Greatbatch and Bahl, hold that gender-sensitive interpretation of the already
existing definition is the preferable way to include women’s experiences. Haines implicates that there
is room within the existing legal structures to incorporate gender-based claims,402 stating that “neither
the refugee definition nor the 1951 Convention, in general, refers to sex or gender. This omission is,
however, without significance. The ordinary meaning of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention in its
context and in the light of the objects and purpose of the Convention requires the conclusion that the
Convention protects both women and men and it must therefore be given a gender inclusive and
gender-sensitive interpretation.”403This has been supported by Greatbatch, who voices that greater
gender-sensitivity can in fact be achieved within the existing structure of the Convention. She
emphasises that “a human rights-based approach to defining persecution, the recognition of women
as a particular social group, documentation of discriminatory and repressive measures aimed at or
particularly affecting women, access to dull and fair determination procedures, and a liberal reading

of the Convention definition, would provide the basis for the development of a profile of genderbased refugee claims, and for recognition of the difference gender makes.”404 Echoing the intentions
of gender mainstreaming as method,405 Haines further argues that adding gender as a sixth
enumerated ground to the 1951 Convention, may have negative impact for women claimants as “the
argument in favour of a sixth ground may have the unintended effect of further marginalizing women
if misinterpreted as an implicit concession that sex and gender have no place in refugee law at the
present”406
As demonstrated above, Haines has voiced support for the approach of gender-sensitive
interpretation of the existing grounds to include women’s experiences in the refugee discourse.
According to him, “the approach of gender-sensitive interpretation seems to place a greater emphasis
on the intentions of the Convention in extending protection indiscriminately, and that insight in these
intentions should guide its reading and interpretation. This locates the problem not as an issue of the
formulation of the law itself, but rather of it being read from a partial perspective.”407 The purpose of
the 1951 Convention is not to provide protection to all persons that are victims of persecution.
Adjudicators in number of states identify anti-discrimination as an underlying norm of the 1951
Convention and rely on the preamble of the Convention in search for interpretative guidance. 408 The
anti-discrimination approach provides a starting point, where persons who are persecuted for at least
one of the enumerated Convention grounds (race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular
social group, or political opinion), are the persons whose human rights are already being violated for
discriminatory reasons.409 As voiced by Lord Hoffman in Islam;Ex-Parte Shah:
“The inclusion of ‘particular social group’ recognised that there might be different
criteria for discrimination, in pari materiae with discrimination on other grounds, which
would be equally offensive to principles of human rights... In choosing to use general
term ‘particular social group’ rather than an enumeration of specific groups, the framers
of the Convention were in my opinion intending to include whatever groups might be
regarded as coming within the anti-discriminatory objectives of the Convention.”410

Therefore, having a flexible ground, such as ‘particular social group’, arguably provides a limited
‘safety net’ for those persons who face actions that “deny human dignity in any key-way.”411 Thus,
the question remains as to whether the exclusion of women’s experiences from the refugee discourse
is due to too much freedom at the hands of decision-makers, who hold the final word when it comes
to interpreting the law. The UNHCR Guidelines recognise the interpretation (and interpretative
frameworks) as the source of the issues concerning gender and the refugee definition paragraph 5
says:
”Historically, the refugee definition has been interpreted through a framework of male
experiences, which has meant that many claims of women and of homosexuals, have
gone unrecognised.” 412
Arguably it is not the aspects of the law itself that constitute the problems, but rather the historical
male-centric way of reading of the law. Paragraph 5 can be read as creating a framework in which
the approach of gender-sensitive interpretation is favoured over that of altering the text of the refugee
definition. It does so because it implies that even if the concepts of gender and gender-based
persecution are formally introduced into the language of the law, their meaning would still be unclear
and subject to interpretation and differing definitions in any case.413 Further, the Guidelines also
address the question of whether to add gender as a sixth enumerated ground for persecution in
paragraph 6 where it states:
“even though gender is not specifically referenced in the refugee definition, it is widely
accepted that it can influence, or dictate, the type of persecution or harm suffered and
the reasons for this treatment. The refugee definition, properly interpreted, therefore
covers gender-related claims. As such, there is no need to add an additional ground to
the 1951 Convention definition.”414
Whether gender-sensitive interpretation of the existing grounds or adding gender as the sixth
enumerated ground would better incorporate women’s experiences to the refugee discourse depends

on various aspects. Even if the textual addition would bring some redress to the built-in male bias of
the Convention refugee definition, adding gender as the sixth ground would not amend the
interpretative challenges involved in determining refugee status. The textual addition assumes
consensus on the nature of gender-based persecution, but as examined in the cases of this thesis, this
is not, de facto, the case. Supported by the intersectionality theory, women’s experiences are
multifaceted and complex. They comprise layers of different personal, cultural, societal, and political
aspects, which all contribute to their claims.
Moreover, whether gender-sensitive interpretation or the textual addition will more
correctly incorporate women’s gender-based claims for asylum depends on the interpretation and
adoption of guidelines and harmonization of practice. Were gender to be added as a sixth ground to
the 1951 Convention, it would not harmonize the realities of these women, which are all unique and
layered. The cases would still need to be decided case-by-case basis which means that every aspect
of the claims would still be prone to interpretation. It is this room for interpretation, which allows the
law to adapt to the challenges at hand. In sum, were gender to be added as a sixth enumerated ground,
there would still be need a to adjudicate women’s claims to refugee on a case-by-case basis, in order
to ensure their protection under international law. These two approaches do not necessarily exclude
each other. Adding gender as a sixth enumerated ground could provide a platform for women’s
experiences of persecution in the refugee discourse, in situations where women are being persecuted
as women or because they are women. Gender nexus could stop the funnelling of women’s claims
into ‘particular social group’ or ‘political opinion’ ground. Bifurcated nexus analysis could finally
acknowledge women’s claims on the grounds of gender-based persecution, not only because of the
failure of state protection. However, as the incorporation of a new Convention ground is slow, gendersensitive interpretation of the existing grounds and the evolving jurisprudence of the States provide
a timelier redress to the challenges of women’s claims for refugee under the 1951 Convention.

6. Advantage of Indeterminacy
Francesco Maiani argues that the indeterminacy of the concept of persecution provides the refugee
definition with an indispensable element of flexibility. With reference to Atle Grah-Madsen: “ The
term persecution has nowhere been defined and this was probably deliberate. It seems as if the
drafters have wanted to introduce a flexible concept which might be applied to circumstances as

69

they might arise; in other words, that they capitulated before the inventiveness of humanity to think
up new ways of persecuting fellow men.”415
The purpose of the Geneva Convention is not to repress crimes of persecution. Unlike
in criminal law, the requirement for accuracy is absent here. Instead, the refugee definition caters to
the needs of persons in an intolerable position in their countries of origin, and the evolving means
of persecution.416 Indeed, the indeterminacy of the Geneva Convention can be seen as a strong
indication in favour of an evolutionary and context-sensitive application of the term.417 Scholars
such as Maiani and Martin have emphasized the advantages of the indeterminacy by pointing out
that in practice “the concept of ‘persecution’ has expanded to include forms of harm that were
certainly not present to the Convention’s drafters, such as domestic abuse. Thus, indeterminacy has
allowed the concept to evolve in response to both the “changing nature of persecution”, and to the
changing sensibilities of our own societies.”418
On the contrary, Hathaway has voiced that the open-endedness of the refugee
definition on this crucial point makes it vulnerable to restrictive interpretation, or even to
manipulation.

419

The way in which the term ‘persecution’ is interpreted and applied has had

compelling impact. For example, in the 1980’s and 1990’s, when the forced migrants escaping
breakdown of State organizations and triggering the civil card, the authorities of asylum countries
started to enforce strictly a requirement of “individualized” persecution. This followed that the
asylum seeker has to show that he or she has been “singled out” for persecution, or of being “more
at risk” than similarly placed persons.420 Maiani has voiced that this reading of the refugee definition
is clearly unusual. The Convention’s requirement that persecution be linked to factors such as race,
or religion makes no numerical distinctions: the affected group can be made up of handful of
individuals of a whole population- like the European Jews, who were the Convention drafters model
refugee population.421
This rather radical example shines light on how the doctrines are easily dictated by an
intent to stem refugee flows. The fear of “flood gates” can and does- insensibly invite national
authorities to reduce the concept of persecution to its semantic minimum: the threat to life, limb or
freedom. While the indeterminacy of the 1951 Convention allows its member states margin of

appreciation to better account for the changing forms of persecution and individual circumstances
the applicants face, the concept of protection also entails a drawback, namely the inconsistency
within and across different jurisdictions.
The UNHCR guidelines, evolving case law and guidance in the member States and the
scholarly writings have clarified the refugee definition considerably. The concept of persecution
does not suffer from a feeble lack of definition in refugee law, the opposite. It is clear that persecution
may emanate from the authorities and from non-state actors, if the authorities are unable or unwilling
to provide effective protection from the actors of persecution. Persecution can be aimed at an
individual, group, or population, as long as it is connected to a common defining characteristic such
as race, religion or political opinion.
However, the issue of how to adopt a hermeneutic approach that leads to consistent
jurisprudence within and across the States and adopts the virtues of flexibility at the same time
remains.

422

Maiani argues that the reluctance of legislators judges, and some authors around the

world to take the step, and give an unequivocal meaning to ‘persecution’ in refugee law, is not
necessarily due to a conceptual reluctancy, but rather to the need to retain some discretion in order
to steer asylum policies in a rapidly changing world.

423

He goes on saying that “within limits,

indeterminacy is almost inherent feature of the ‘persecution’ concept in refugee law. Woeful or not,
its root cause is not (only) an intellectual inability to agree on essentials of the concept, but rather
the hard political tension between the universalist commitment to give protection, on the one hand,
and the task to control migration that is implied in our understanding of Statehood, on the other
hand”.424

7. Conclusions
The exclusion of women’s experiences from the refugee discourse is inherent in the 1951 Convention
refugee definition. As the language itself does not speak of gender there has been unnecessary
conceptual barriers to women’s claims. However, today, seventy years after establishing the 1951
Convention it is generally accepted that the Convention refugee definition as a whole should be
interpreted with an awareness of possible gender dimensions and that it is essential to define and

distinguish between the terms “gender” and “sex”.425 The evolution of the notion of gender-related
violence has had a positive impact on breaking the barriers to women’s gender-related asylum claims.
Notions of rape are no longer excused as an act of lust, FGM is no longer tolerated as harmless cultural
practice and domestic violence is no longer just a private matter. It has been recognised that gender
(rather than sex) may have an impact in the form of persecution, while the reasons for persecution
may arise from the construction of gender in the society.
This thesis has provided a gender-sensitive overview of the existing refugee discourse
and assessed the barriers to women’s claims for asylum under the 1951 Convention and its 1967
Protocol grounds ‘particular social group’ and ‘political opinion’. Furthermore, it has examined
scholarly writings and interpretative guidelines to find answers to the question of, whether women’s
claims for asylum will be better incorporated to the refugee discourse by adopting gender-sensitive
interpretation or by adding ‘gender’ as independent ground to the Convention. In doing so, it has
analysed the 1951 Convention refugee definition elements that have deemed most problematic in
gender-related cases: definition and understanding of the term ‘persecution’, non-state actors of
persecution, and ‘nexus’ between persecution and one of the enumerated Convention grounds. The
thesis has turned to common law jurisdiction from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, and the United States in search for in depth analysis and reasoning in gender-related cases.
Adopting a gender-sensitive interpretation of the 1951 Convention does not mean that
all women are automatically entitled to refugee status.426 It must be proved that the applicant is subject
to reasonable fear of harm amounting to ‘persecution’ and the ‘persecution’ must bear nexus to at
least one of the enumerated Convention grounds, namely race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group, or political opinion. While there is no standard definition of the term
‘persecution’ it has been generally approved to include the risk of serious harm combined with failure
of state protection. The concept of ‘persecution’ must be interpreted as an evolutionary concept and
the states are allowed a wide margin of appreciation. Thus, persecution must be viewed case-by-case
basis, considering individual circumstances. While the liberal case-by-case approach is praised by
the supporters of intersectional theory, it also endangers the predictability, objectivity, and
consistency within and across jurisdictions at large. Although states are encouraged to turn to
international human rights instruments for guidance, there is still room for differing interpretations
as to what constitutes ‘persecution’.
As to the matter of agents of persecution, the thesis acknowledges that much of the
violence faced by women is committed by non-state actors such as husbands, fathers, in-laws and
425

sometimes even by the women in the local community. It has been established that the refugee
definition does not require a state to be the perpetrator, and that ‘private’ or non-state agents may
equally fall within the refugee definition when the State fails to provide protection to the individual.
The issue of ‘nexus’ between persecution and a Convention ground has posed
substantial barriers to women’s gender-related claims because gender is not one of the existing
Convention grounds. In chapter 2.3. this thesis demonstrates the evolution of bifurcated nexus
analysis by examining some common law cases developing the bifurcated nexus analysis. This
trilogy considers cases from different states, where women applied for asylum based on genderrelated violence at the hands of non-state actor in a state where gender equality was evident and the
state was unable or unwilling to protect the applicants. In the United Kingdom case of Islam;Ex
Parte Shah the House of Lords considered two conjoined appeals of Pakistani women who fled
marital violence. Although the individual circumstances of the two women were different in various
aspects, both claims involved feared harm at the hands of non-State actors in situations where the
State had failed to provide protection. Pursuant to Lord Hoffman's formula (Persecution= Serious
Harm + failure of State Protection) the required nexus is established if either of the constituent
elements of persecution are causally related to a Convention reason. Employing bifurcative nexus
analysis, the House of Lords answered affirmative on both counts. The decision established an
analytical path around the barrier created by the characterization of spousal violence as a “personal
affair directed against the applicants as individuals" and recognized that States have the
responsibility to provide protection to its national without discrimination to gender.
After the decision of Islam;Ex Parte Shah, the thesis assesses the New Zealand case
Refugee Appeal No. 71427/99 in subchapter 2.3.2. The claim involved similar issues, namely
persecution by a non-State actor (husband) in a country with gender inequality and failed state
protection of women in Iran. Adopting Lord Hoffman's formula in Islam; Ex parte shah
(Persecution= Serious Harm + failure of State Protection) the tribunal found that the abuse and
harassment by the ex-husband constituted serious harm, but there was no nexus to a Convention
ground. However, the nexus was found with the failure of state protection and a convention ground.
The additional value this case provided was that the tribunal found that considered cumulatively, the
discriminatory measures against women in Iran constituted serious harm.
The next case considered in the thesis was the case of Minister for immigration and
Multicultural Affairs v. Khawar affirming that women who are victims of domestic violence may

73

qualify for protection under the convention ground particular social group. Here the four justices
stated that the relevant social group should simply be "women" as "women in any society are a
distinct and recognizable group". After adopting the same formula for bifurcated nexus analysis as
Islam; Ex parte shah and Refugee Appeal No. 71427/99 (Persecution= Serious Harm + failure of
State Protection) the tribunal stated that the nexus element could be established when either the
serious harm or the failure of State protection is for reasons of Convention ground. Alike in the other
cases herein, the court ruled out the nexus between the non-State actor and the Convention ground
and finally established nexus between the failure of State protection and the Convention ground.
The additional value of the case arose from the opinion of Justice Kirby, who stated that although
some singling out is required to establish causation, the motivation or intention for this need not
arise from enmity or malignant intentions.
After reviewing the three consistent cases and the evolution of bifurcated nexus
analysis, the thesis turns into the judicial practice of United States in chapter 2.43. Here, the thesis
reviewed the unfortunate events occurring after Matter of Kasinga in the Matter of R-A-. In a
landmark decision Matter of Kasinga the BIA ruled eleven to one to grant asylum to accept a genderdefined social group as grounds for asylum after applying the bifurcated nexus analysis. In the same
year the majority of BIA rejected a gender defined social group and the application of any form of
bifurcated nexus analysis in the case of Matter of R-A. The decision of BIA was inconsistent with
the precedent and the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) own guidelines. The case took
13 years and intervention of three different Attorney Generals (Reno, Ashcroft, and Mukasey) until
it was finally decided on the level of immigration judge, not constituting a binding precedent. 18
years after the case of Matter of Kasinga the BIA issued a precedent decision in a Matter of A-R-CG-, involving domestic violence. However, the victory did not last long, when the administration
took a similar case, Matter of A-B-, in 2018 and reversed the long-awaited precedent established by
the Matter of A-R-C-G-. This chapter demonstrated the unpredictable and unequal development of
jurisdiction in United States placing woman asylum seekers in a disadvantaged position in
comparison to asylum seekers in other States. While the Matter of Kasinga was praised for opening
doors for women's claims for asylum the Matter of R-A- and Matter of A-B-, slammed it shut.
Drawing from some of the landmark cases developing bifurcated nexus analysis the thesis
establishes that the nexus requirement could be met when either the serious harm or failure of state
protection is “for reasons of a Convention ground”. This development recognises gender violence as
grounds for asylum and provides a way out of a complex issue of nexus in gender-related asylum

74

claims. The analysis has been widely recognized and the trilogy of cases provides an example of how
the national jurisdictions interact with each other by referring to cases and opinions from other states.
By doing so, they contribute to the evolution of the 1951 Convention and ensure that it is interpreted
in manner that takes into account the realities of the societies we live in. While the United Kingdom,
New Zealand, Australia and Canada adhere to the UNHRCR’s approach to the nexus issue, the United
States (Ninth Circuit) approach differs from the trend. The United States posits that a causal link must
be established to the persecutors. However, as there has been differing interpretations, it is yet to be
seen whether the United States will bring their understanding of nexus in line with the UNHCR
approach.
The thesis further analysed the current judicial practice from United Kingdom, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, and United States to see how consistent the guidelines in the studied countries was
with the UNHCR and with each other. Review of the national gender guidelines established that there
are multiple issues with regards to the national gender guidelines. One of the main problems in the
refugee status determination is the differing interpretation of the standards in different countries and
even within jurisdictions. The outcome of the decision may depend on the state the applicant ends up
applying asylum in. Thus, there should be a common standard for applying the refugee definition that
would not cut below the existing standards. Moreover, another issue arises from the non-binding
nature of the guidance. Some states adhere to the UNHCR gender-sensitive interpretation of the
refugee definition in relation to most elements of the refugee definition (Canada) while some states
attribute gender only to some aspects of refugee definition. For example, where most of the guidelines
refer gender-related cases to the ‘particular social group’ ground as a default, Canada seems to be the
only state to recognize women’s claims as political. In addition, although states adhere to the
UNHCR and issue gender guidelines to the decision makers, they are easily dismissed due to their
non-binding nature.
Gender being absent from the Convention grounds, poses additional burden to women’s
claims, as they must fit their experiences of violence into existing male defined grounds and criteria.
Chapter 3 and 4 of the theses addressed the issues arising from the funnelling of women’s genderrelated claims into existing Convention grounds, starting with the most invoked ground ‘membership
of a particular social group’ (chapter 3). Here, the thesis examined the evolution of the Protected
characteristics approach (ejusdem generis) by assessing the BIA case of Matter of Acosta and
Canadian Supreme Court case Ward. The approach established in Acosta examined whether a group
is united by an immutable characteristic or a characteristic that is so fundamental to human dignity
that a person should not be compelled to forsake it. The Supreme Court in Ward took the analysis
further and defined three authoritative categories of “particular social group” (innate or unchangeable
75

characteristics, characteristics fundamental to human dignity, and former status). It was found in this
chapter, that although adopting the ejusdem generis approach may promote consistency in decisionmaking, it may also complicate the refugee inquiry in a way that could be avoided by giving the
phrase its ordinary meaning. The protected characteristics approach was followed by the examination
of the social perception approach (chapter 3.1.2). The approach focuses on the external perception of
a given group in the country of origin. It has been praised for the fact that it stems from the words
“membership of a particular social group” and because it provides wider judicial discretion than
ejusdem generis approach. However, it is also overly broad and makes the societal attitudes
determinative of the existence of the social group. Not only does this pose an evidential difficulty in
the country of origin, but also in other societies. After discussing the differences between the
approaches and the possibilities of a merger, the chapter concludes that women may constitute a
particular social group based on common characteristics of sex, whether or not they associate with
one another based on that shared characteristics.
Chapter 4. examines the issues arising from adjudication of women’s gender-based claims
under the Convention ground ‘political opinion’. The discussion in this chapter focuses on the issue
of public/private dichotomy and the underlying understanding that women’s experiences belong to
the “private” sphere and are therefore not “political”. It points out the problem where the adjudicators
do not see the actions of women (such as opposition to harmful traditional practices upheld by the
society they live in (FGM) or refusal for oppressive State practice) as political, but rather they
adjudicate these claims under artificial social group grounds. It was established here that
mainstreaming women’s claims only to “particular social group” ground excludes the women’s
experiences from becoming “public” or “political”. At the same time, it strengthens the practice of
using “particular social group” as all-encompassing and unpredictable ground.
There is no straightforward answer to the question of whether gender-sensitive
interpretation of the existing grounds or adding gender as sixth enumerated ground would better
incorporate women’s experiences to the refugee discourse. Arguably the drafters of the 1951
Convention left the indispensable element of flexibility on the concept of persecution on purpose to
ensure that it can be applied to circumstances as they might arise. The indeterminacy has allowed the
concept to evolve to the ‘changing nature of persecution’ and include forms of harm, that may not
have been seen as relevant to the drafters 70 years ago, such as FGM or domestic violence.
Even if the textual addition would bring some redress to the built-in male bias of the
Convention refugee definition, adding gender as sixth ground would not amend the interpretative
challenges involved in determining refugee status. The textual addition assumes consensus on the
nature of gender-based persecution. Supported by the intersectionality theory, women’s experiences
76

are multifaceted and complex. They comprise of layers of different personal, cultural, societal, and
political aspects which all contribute their claims. Were gender to be added as a sixth enumerated
ground, there would still be a need to adjudicate women’s claims to refugee on a case-by-case basis,
in order to ensure their protection under international law. Adding gender as a sixth enumerated
ground could, however, provide a platform for women’s experiences of persecution in the refugee
discourse, in situations where women are being persecuted as women or because they are women.
Gender nexus could stop the funnelling of non-political women’s claims into “particular social group”
or “political opinion” ground. Through bifurcated nexus analysis, the decision makers could finally
acknowledge women’s claims to refugee on the grounds of gender-based persecution, not only
because of the failure of State protection. Furthermore, the two approaches do not necessarily exclude
each other. Gender-sensitive interpretation of the existing grounds and the gender inclusive evolution
of the State jurisprudence may provide a timelier redress to the challenge’s women face in the refugee
discourse. The challenge that remains is the States balancing act between universalist commitment
to give protection, on the one hand, and the political pressure to control migration on the other hand.
