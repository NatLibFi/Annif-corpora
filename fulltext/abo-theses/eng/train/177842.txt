Acknowledgements
The past two years as a student in the Master’s programme in Governance of
Digitalization has been an unforeseen opportunity for me to open doors, create new
networks, and meet new people. In addition to the broad knowledge about governance of
digitalization, acquired English language skills, and the Master’s degree, I am particularly
happy that I had the courage to take a leap out of my comfort zone and throw myself into
this adventure of studying after multitude years in working career.
This thesis would not have finished on time without my wonderful supervisor, Gunilla
Widén, Professor, Information Systems Åbo Akademi University, who has been
invaluable help and support during the thesis process. I want to thank you for all your
effort, time and encouragement, and I highly appreciate the inspiring motivation and trust
you had in me throughout the process. Without a doubt, the thesis would lack many vital
elements without the guidance, support, and knowledge of my supervisor.
Equally, I want to express my gratitude to a few selected managers of the case company,
who advised and helped me to form a better picture of the operations of the case company,
and provided me a unique and educational experience by allowing me to be a part of an
interesting phase of the organizational reform. In addition, I profoundly want to thank the
operational employees of the sub-unit of the case company, who participated in the study
as interviewees, and provided me their time, input, and valuable insights.
Above all, I am thankful for my family and friends, and I want to express my gratitude to
all those people who encouraged me to carry on and for always believing in me.
Especially, from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank my dear sister Melisa and friend
Tuulia for supporting me when most needed - when I count my blessings, I count you
twice. Finally, even though this Master’s programme has been full of work, I do not regret
for a single moment. At the same time, it is both wistful and delightful to note that after
this thesis and with the degree of Master of Science in Economics, my journey continues
into new adventures, of which I am grateful.

Abstract for Master’s Thesis
Subject: Governance of Digitalization

Title: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management
Supervisor: Gunilla Widén
Supervisor: Shahrokh Nikou
Abstract:
This thesis explores individuals’ knowledge-sharing practices in a real-life organization, and it is
done as a commission for a Finnish environmental management company. The aim of the thesis
is to provide a preliminary mapping of both the organizational and individual factors that either
inhibit or enable the internal knowledge sharing practices of the case company so that these
practices can be further developed.
Knowledge and knowledge sharing are argued to be one of the most important competitive
advantages in organizations. Previous studies have shown that if an organization does not operate
on the best available knowledge and knowhow, a great deal of resources is wasted. Thus, it is
indisputable that knowledge sharing, and knowledge management are important to an
organization. Even though knowledge management is an extensively used term in today’s
business life, it is still somewhat unclear how knowledge management and internal knowledge
sharing practices can be better managed and developed in organizations. Furthermore,
organizational and individual factors that influence individual’s knowledge behavior in internal
knowledge sharing practices is relatively neglected area in the knowledge management research.
The study was conducted as an empirical qualitative case study, in which both participant
observations and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection methods. A content
analysis was carried out to analyze the data and to create SWOT analyses to illustrate the factors
affecting internal knowledge sharing practices. The barriers and enablers of both organizational
and individual factors were illustrated as own SWOT analyses. This thesis lays a great emphasis
on the collected data from the interviewed operational personnel of one of the sub-units of the
case company.
The results show that the case company could benefit from better communication, knowledge
sharing, and knowledge management within the organization. Based on the reviewed literature
and the research results, this thesis suggests an action proposal for the future improvements of
the case company’s communications, knowledge sharing practices, and knowledge management.
The proposed plan for action suggests that the future developments of the case company should
focus on defining formal and shared policies, determining tools, training and orientation systems,
managing through knowledge, and focusing on individuals’ needs. However, in order to
generalize these findings in the case company, further research is needed. For instance, an
extended study, including both internal and external networks could increase more general
understanding of the development needs of the case company’s knowledge management and
knowledge sharing practices.

Terms and Abbreviations
HRM

Human resource management. HRM practices affect and can promote the
individuals’ knowledge-sharing motivation, especially the intrinsic
motivation to share knowledge (Gagné, 2009).

IA

Intangible assets. Intangible assets are the opposite to tangible assets. For
example, knowledge and know-how are considered intangible assets as they
are very hard to copy. (Dalkir, 2011; Kumaraswamy & Chitale, 2012)

ICT

Information Communication Technology. A general term for data
management and system management (Kuettner, Diehl & Schubert, 2013).

IC

Intellectual capital. Intellectual capital consists of organizations core
competencies such as its tacit and explicit knowledge and know-how which
can be acquired, for instance, through knowledge management processes
(Dalkir, 2011; Pinho, Rego & Cunha, 2012).

SME

Small and medium-sized enterprises. According the European Commission
employment criterion (2016), an SME is any business that employs less than
250 people, but more than 50 employees. To be specific, the case company
employs in total 350 employees, and the annual turnover exceeds 50
million. However, the amount of the operational personnel, which were
under study, is approximately one hundred persons (100). Therefore, this
research focuses only to SMEs. However, in this thesis, organization and
company are used as synonyms for SME and vice versa.

SWOT

Business analysis, where the characteristics of the organization or function
are divided into four categories, which are strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities and threats (Sevkli, Oztekin, Uysal, Torlak, Turkyilmaz &
Delen, 2012).

1 INTRODUCTION
In this chapter the area of research is briefly described, and the motivation to the research
topic and a research gap are defined. In addition, the objective of the thesis and the
research questions are posed, as well as the structure of the thesis is shortly outlined.

1.1 Area of Research
It is said that knowledge is power and shared knowledge brings success
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Knowledge sharing can be regarded as a business transaction
process and, thus, considered as a central factor for businesses (Barachini, 2009; Stary,
Barachini & Hawamdeh, 2008). Additionally, regardless of the size of the company or
the industry that the company operates in, knowledge management and knowledge
sharing are needed in managing change in an ever-changing environment. (Juholin, 2009;
Savolainen & Lehmuskorpi, 2017; Väisänen, 2019; Wendelin, 2013) However, due to the
multifaceted and complex phenomenon of knowledge (Blackler, 1995; Stary et al., 2008)
and its contextuality (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008; Widén, 2017), knowledge, and both
its management and sharing practices, require a broad view and a deep understanding of
the role of knowledge in all company operations (Foss, Husted, Michailova, 2010;
Laihonen, Hannula & Helander, 2013).
In order to take the full advantage of knowledge, it must be shared and disseminated
throughout the organization operations and products (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al. 2013).
However, sharing and disseminating knowledge throughout the organization is rarely a
straightforward process. Earlier studies have demonstrated that knowledge does not flow
easily even when an organization makes a considerable effort to enable knowledge
sharing and exchange. (Dalkir, 2011; Hislop, 2013; Szulanski, 1996) Therefore, due to
the human involvement in knowledge, knowledge sharing boils down to the individuals
(Henttonen, Kianto & Ritala, 2016). Further, functional interaction and communication
in the organization is a starting point for good knowledge management and, thus, a
prerequisite for knowledge sharing (Juholin, 2009; Sydänmaanlakka, 2014; Wendelin,
2013). Therefore, individuals and their participation and willingness to share knowledge
are crucial for knowledge sharing in organizations (Ardichvili, 2008; Barachini, 2009;
Okkonen, Vuori & Helander, 2018).

To conclude, the increasing amount of knowledge in workplace context requires broad
understanding on how to interpret knowledge in an interactive way. This, in turn, obliges
new forms of leadership in order to balance successfully in between the interface of
knowledge and decision making (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019; Solovjew-Wartiovaara,
2019; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Becoming a knowledge-sharing organization requires
above all new leadership and change management skills, which can further provide
supportive knowledge management structures, utilize modern technologies, and
encourage a knowledge sharing culture. One of the main goals of knowledge management
is to create an organizational culture and work environment that encourages people to
share their knowledge (Kuitunen, 2020; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Furthermore, the
knowledge sharing culture enables a work environment that supports the cooperation,
motivation, trust, and skills of individuals needed for effective knowledge sharing (Janus,
2016; Kuettner et al., 2013; Razmerita, Kirchner & Nielsen, 2016).

1.2 Motivation for the Study
Knowledge is vital to organizations and, therefore, it is essential to ensure the transfer
and sharing of knowledge among employees (Janus, 2016; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995;
Laihonen et al., 2013). Knowledge sharing per se has been studied a lot, and the general
motivations behind employee knowledge sharing are well known (Ardichvili, 2008; Lin,
2007; Vuori & Okkonen; 2012). However, typically, research in the knowledge
management field mainly focuses on the organizational profitability and productivity
perspectives, and the studies conducted in workplace contexts are primarily based only
on the individual’s information behavior or knowledge skills (Vuori & Okkonen, 2012).
Therefore, the knowledge sharing practices in real-life work environment have been
relatively less elucidated (Foss et al., 2010; Razmerita et al., 2016; Sydänmaanlakka,
2014; Widén, 2017), and detailed studies about knowledge sharing process are relatively
rare (Ahn & Hong, 2019). However, the greatest benefit can be gained through
understanding of the factors that influence knowledge sharing practices and knowledge
sharing behavior of employees in real-life organizations (Razmerita et al., 2016). Hence,
there is a growing need for a situational approach to knowledge use and sharing
(Solovjew-Wartiovaara, 2019). It can be stated that there is a clear research gap on reallife studies of knowledge sharing practices from an employee’s perspective, in which both
organizational and individual factors are considered simultaneously.

Furthermore, the need for this research has arisen from the case company, which can be
seen as a mandator of this research. The author of the thesis has no prior connection with
the case company. The case company is currently undergoing a major reform of its core
operations and also their communications and knowledge sharing functions are being
reformed. Although the case company has developed its knowledge sharing practices and
communications during a reform project, a corresponding empirical study directly related
to knowledge management and knowledge sharing practices from the perspective of
employees has not yet been done in the case company. Therefore, this study can bring
new perspectives to the future reforms of the case company and provide valuable
additional knowledge on the current state of the subject. The author of this thesis has a
personal motivation to innovate modern knowledge management and finds the field of
knowledge management and knowledge sharing interesting. Moreover, the author of this
thesis strongly believes in the development of business capabilities by utilizing
knowledge more effectively.
It is noteworthy that this research focuses only to small-and-medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) operating in the same country, and not, for instance, to multinational corporations
operating in different countries and time zones. To be specific, according the European
Commission employment criterion (2016), an SME is any business that employs less than
250 people, but more than 50 employees. The number of employees from 500 to 250 was
reduced in 1995 and further, the characteristics were refined in 2003 (European
Commission, 2016). The case company employs in total 350 employees, and the annual
turnover exceeds 50 million, but the amount of the operational personnel, which were
under study, is approximately one hundred persons (100). In addition, the knowledge
management and knowledge sharing practices challenges with the case company are
typical of a small or medium sized company rather than larger company (Rossignoli,
2017; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Zieba, Bolisani & Scarso, 2016). Typically, in the
literature, the large enterprises face a different kind of challenges and barriers to
knowledge sharing practices, as the case company under investigation in this thesis does.
Therefore, due to the nature of the challenges in the case company’s knowledge
management and sharing practices, and as this study focused only on the operational staff
of the case company and only its one sub-unit, the case company can be considered as an
SME in this thesis.

1.3 Objective of the Study and Research Questions
The purpose of this thesis is to provide a preliminary mapping of the case company’s
ongoing and upcoming communications and knowledge sharing development project by
identifying the barriers and enablers of the case company’s internal knowledge sharing
practices. In addition, based on the results of the research, the aim is to provide an action
proposal to better manage and develop knowledge management and knowledge sharing
practices of the case company. The study is conducted as an empirical qualitative case
study, in which the employees’ perspectives are obtained by interviewing the operational
personnel of one sub-unit of the case company.
There is one main research question and three supporting research questions. By
answering to the supporting research questions, the main research question is answered.
The main research question is as follows:
How can knowledge sharing and internal knowledge sharing practices be better
managed in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)?
The supporting research questions are:
RQ1: Why is knowledge sharing and its management important to an
organization?
RQ2: What organizational and individual factors influence the internal
knowledge sharing practices?
RQ3: How can internal knowledge sharing practices and knowledge management
be developed within a SME?

1.4 Structure of the Thesis
This section covers the design of the present study and briefly outlines the main chapters
and their contents. This thesis is divided into six chapters and they are organized as
follows:

2 MANAGING KNOWLEDGE SHARING IN SMES
The purpose of the literature review in this empirical research is to shed light on the topic
of this thesis in a scholarly manner and; thus, to answer the main research question
identified in the first chapter: ‘How can knowledge sharing practices support internal
knowledge sharing and its management in SMEs?’. Different theories cover the findings
and concepts of several researchers and help to understand the relevance and significance
of the research. However, due to the large amount of the theoretical perspectives and
literature of the topic, this literature review is limited to a detailed presentation of
academic literature that is specifically related to the research question of the study. The
literature review of this thesis is divided into following sub-section. Section 2.2. analyze
extensively literature of both modern knowledge management and, in section 2.3. the
factors influencing knowledge sharing practices.
In this chapter, the core concepts of the research, such as knowledge, knowledge sharing,
and knowledge management, are clarified. In addition, the topic literature of change
management and its role in knowledge sharing is presented. The following chapter
answers the first supporting research question: ‘Why is knowledge sharing and its
management important to an organization?’.

2.1 Knowledge
2.1.1 Knowledge as a Concept
Knowledge is a multifaceted phenomenon and its diversity cannot be unambiguously
described (Blackler, 1995; Dalkir, 2011; Stary et al., 2008). To put it briefly, knowledge
can be described as a state of mind, an object, a process, an individual’s experiences,
insights, values, and prerequisites, for both accessing information and skills and, thus, as
a framework for evaluating new experiences and information (Halonen & Laukkanen,
2008; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). As stated by many researchers (e.g. Hislop, 2013; Widén,
2017), knowledge as a concept is abstract and, thus, is highly dependent on its context.
Therefore, knowledge can be classified into different types, such as tacit, explicit,
cultural, functional, conceptual, embedded, individual, social, declarative, processual,
causal, conditional, relational, and pragmatic (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008).

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

According to many researchers, knowledge is a central factor for businesses and one of
the main sources of lasting competitive advantages in organizations (Hislop, 2013;
Nonaka, 2007; Stary et al., 2008). However, in order to exploit the knowledge, it must be
first identified and captured and, then, utilized wisely and in a controlled manner
throughout the organization (Jantunen, 2005; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). More precisely,
according to Janus (2016), knowledge is useless if it is not embedded in the organization’s
products and processes. Similarly, Laihonen et al. (2013) states that knowledge is not
automatically valuable or creates a competitive advantage. Knowledge can be even
detrimental rather than useful to an organization, if the data collection emphasizes rather
quantity than quality and usability (Laihonen et al., 2013; Janus, 2016).
Indeed, the amount of data itself is a challenge and the organizations constantly need to
develop new tools to cope with the ever-increasing amount of data, information and
knowledge (Burmeister, Drews & Schirmer, 2018; Pirkkalainen, Salo, Makkonen &
Tarafdar, 2017). Typically, a flood of knowledge can result to overcapacity either in
person, in an information system, or an organization, and knowledge is lost or left unused
(Laihonen et al., 2013; Tarafdar, Gupta, Turel, 2015). Therefore, one of the most
important challenges related to knowledge and its management is its sharing
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Pinho et al., 2012; Laihonen et al., 2013). However, it is not
axiomatic how knowledge should be shared and managed (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008).
Knowledge sharing is discussed in more detail in Section 2.2. and the concept of
knowledge management is defined and addressed more precisely in Section 2.3.
Knowledge is often used simultaneously with concepts of data and information (Faucher,
Everett & Lawson, 2008). The differences in terms are, of course, due to the use of
knowledge, which is typically based on the acquisition, dissemination and utilization of
knowledge (Hislop, 2013). Although the terms used in practice differ from what they
actually mean, the user does not see much difference between them (Baškarada &
Koronius, 2013). It should also be noted that these terms often are used as synonyms in
Finnish, which is also the language used in the case company. To clarify, the concepts
related to knowledge and their relationships to each other are explained briefly next.

2.1.2 Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom
There are different versions and definitions of the knowledge-related terms as well as for
defining the hierarchy of knowledge. A common and a classical way is to distinguish
data, information, and knowledge from each other and to present them as a pyramid of
knowledge (Bender & Fish, 2000; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). The pyramid of knowledge
used in this study is illustrated in Figure 1, in which data, information, knowledge and
wisdom are described. According to Bender and Fish (2000), the pyramid follows a socalled value chain model, which means that the other elements complement each other
and, thus, form a more processed knowledge that extends to wisdom. Hence, data is
considered as the raw fact and is located at the bottom of the pyramid. Information, on
the other hand, is processed data and is therefore above data. Knowledge is contextualized
information and is set above information (Bender & Fish, 2000). The pyramid is
supplemented with wisdom, which is considered as accumulated knowledge, and is thus
the top of the pyramid (Baškarada & Koronios, 2013). In other words, data is seen as a
prerequisite for information whereas information is seen as a prerequisite for knowledge
(Bender & Fish, 2000). Knowledge is the combination of both data and information and
wisdom is the ability to vision, foresight and operate based on the data, information and
knowledge gathered (Dalkir, 2011).

Moreover, some of the researcher’s state that in addition to the pyramid of data,
information, and knowledge, there is both intelligence and wisdom, where intelligence is
formed before wisdom (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Others argue that the pyramid of data,
information, knowledge and wisdom is extended to enlightenment and then to an
additional level of existence (Faucher et al., 2008). However, this study does not focus in
more detail on the differences of the pyramid of knowledge, but only seeks to clarify the
distinction between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in order to better
understand the concept of knowledge used in this study.
In conclusion, knowledge is, in a way, both a warehouse and a process at the same time
and is derived from data and information (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Similarly, data and
information about history and future trends can be transformed into knowledge and
through it into wisdom and, thus, further utilized within the organization (Mourya &
Gupta, 2012). From this perspective, knowledge can be seen as part of tacit knowledge,
while data and information are considered as part of explicit information
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Virtainlahti, 2009) and, thus, the concepts of tacit and explicit
knowledge are introduced next.

2.1.3 Tacit and Explicit Knowledge
According to Dalkir (2011), the original study by Nonaka (1994), found that there are
two different forms of knowledge, which are tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.
Some authors use similar terms, such as implicit or experiential knowledge, to describe
the transformation of knowledge phase from intangible to tangible (Janus, 2016). In this
thesis, however, the terms tacit and explicit knowledge are used as synonyms for implicit
and experiential knowledge.
Tacit knowledge is something that cannot be fully codified, and it often refers to
knowledge that is neither verbal nor subject-specific (Dalkir, 2011; Nonaka, 2007;
Virtainlahti, 2009). In addition, according to Bucowitz and Williams (1999), tacit
knowledge can also be knowledge that an individual is simply unable to articulate and,
thereby, transform into knowledge. As an example, facial recognition, personal
experience, or bodily knowledge can be considered tacit knowledge (Dalkir, 2011;
Hislop, 2013). Therefore, tacit knowledge can be described as highly personalized

9

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

knowledge or ‘know-how’ and is more than we can say or express and, thus, is hard to
codify (Bukowitz & Williams, 1999; Dalkir, 2011).
Explicit knowledge is the opposite of tacit knowledge (Virtainlahti, 2009). Consequently,
explicit knowledge is documented, visible and, thus, easily expressed, stored and
distributed (Dalkir, 2011; Hau, Kim B, Lee & Kim Y, 2013; Hislop, 2013). All storages,
such as man-made databases, books and the web are and provide explicit knowledge, as
well as all visuals, sound and movement can be considered explicit knowledge, such as
recorded words, numbers and musical notations (Bukowitz & Williams, 1999; Dalkir,
2011; Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008; Virtainlahti, 2009). Since, explicit knowledge can be
expressed fairly easily by using language or other forms of communication, it can be
equated to information (Bukowitz & Williams, 1999). The differences between the
characteristics of tacit and explicit knowledge are presented in the Figure 2 below.
Figure 2. The Characteristics of Tacit and Explicit Knowledge. Developed from Hislop (2013, p. 21).

However, the explicit knowledge repositories are not useful to anyone if they are not well
connected to the user’s tacit knowledge (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008). Nor, tacit
knowledge has no measurable benefit, unless it can be turned into a visible, usable or
explicit form (Dalkir, 2011; Lin, 2007). It has also been understood in organizations that,
unlike tangible assets, which decrease with their use, knowledge assets increase with use
(Davenport and Prusak, 1998; Hislop, 2013). In particular, it does matter what kind of
knowledge is shared (Blankenship, 2009). Previous research has shown that through tacit
knowledge, professional knowledge is shared (Blankenship, 2009, Virtainlahti, 2009).
Therefore, tacit knowledge is considered the most important form of knowledge in
organizations (Virtainlahti, 2009).

SECI Model
In addition, in this thesis, it is essential to better understand how an individual’s tacit
knowledge can be shared and transformed into visible, explicit knowledge in an
organization. Therefore, one central example of the distribution of knowledge from tacit
and explicit knowledge to a so-called continuity of knowledge is illustrated by a SECI
model (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). According to Halonen and Laukkanen (2008), SECI
is an abbreviation of the word’s socialisation, externalization, combination, and
internalization The SECI model is widely used to describe the knowledge creation process
between people and groups (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008). Originally, Nonaka
introduced the SECI model in 1994, which was later supplemented with Takeuchi in 1995
(Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). The SECI model is presented in the Figure 3.
Figure 3. The SECI Model of Knowledge Dimensions. Developed from Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995,
p. 62).

According to both Halonen and Laukkanen (2008), and Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), the
basic idea behind the SECI model is that new knowledge is created when individuals
share and transfer their knowledge across the organization from individual to individual,
from individual to group, from group to individual, or from group to group. In the process
of internalization of information, a tacit declaration of knowledge is created. Learning by
doing illustrates this step. As people work individually and collectively on the
information contained in documents, instructions and so on, they supplement their own
silent knowledge repository. In the socialization phase, tacit knowledge is shared through
collective action, for example, by spending time together, living in the same context,
sharing experiences and developing ideas together. In other words, intensive cooperation

11

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

within the group reflects a strong exchange of information during the socialization phase.
In the externalization phase, tacit knowledge is transformed into explicit information. It
is often linked to the development of policies and systems. For example, reflection and
sharing of mental models are typical functions of the knowledge outsourcing phase. In
the combination phase, the expressed explicit information is transferred as is. This
includes, for example, transforming the existing information into a more shareable
format, such as part of a company knowledge base (Halonen & Laukkanen, 2008; Nonaka
& Takeuchi, 1995).

2.1.4 Knowledge Types in Organizations
Due to the complex nature of knowledge and its sharing, researchers have sought to
describe different forms of knowledge and to find ways to clarify the various ways of
knowledge formation and to differentiate forms of knowledge in organizations. For
example, Jousilahti et al. (2019) suggest that there are numerous different types of
knowledge, such as scientific knowledge, expert knowledge, and experiential knowledge.
Correspondingly, DeLong and Fahey (2000) propose that there are at least three different
forms of knowledge in organizations that can be further divided to tacit and explicit
knowledge. The three types of knowledge in organizations, are:
1. Human knowledge,
2. Social knowledge, and
3. Structured knowledge.

According to De Long and Fahey (2000), in this division of knowledge, both human
knowledge and social knowledge can be referred to as tacit knowledge, and structured
knowledge can be defined as explicit knowledge. Moreover, human knowledge can be
considered the know-how of individuals. Similarly, social knowledge exists in people,
but especially in their relationships, such as relationships between a group or a team.
Thus, social knowledge can be described as a set of collective knowledge. Structured
knowledge, in turn, exists independently of human knowers, since it is embedded in
organization’s structures such as systems, processes, tools, and routines (DeLong and
Fahey, 2000).

12

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Another way to look at forms of knowledge, is to examine it from the perspective of
knowing (Blackler, 1995; Bukowitz & Williams, 1999). Blackler (1995) argues that the
starting point of knowing is better and preferable for the organizations when considering
the dimensions of knowledge. Moreover, he prefers to refer knowledge as knowing, since
knowing is something people do, not what people have (Blackler, 1995). In the same vein,
Bukowitz and Williams (1999) believes that approach of knowing may be more useful to
the organizations, compared to the typical distinction of tacit versus explicit knowledge.
According to Blackler (1995), it is important to take into account, that different types of
organizations need different kinds of knowledge. Therefore, Blackler (1995) identifies
five different categories of knowledge, which are:
1) Embodied, which is acquired by doing,
2) Embedded, meaning organizational routines,
3) Embrained, such as conceptual skills and abilities,
4) Encultured, which is acquired though socialization, and
5) Encoded, such as signs and symbols.
The growing importance of knowledge work has led to an increasing emphasis on
knowledge in the brain, dialogue and symbols, which are, in the terminology used in this
context, embraced, encultured and encoded knowledge. Respectively, the importance of
relying on the knowledge located in bodies and routines, which are embodied and
embedded, is diminishing (Blackler, 1995).
Consequently, Bukowitz and Williams (1999) argue that the fact that an individual does
not share knowledge often has much deeper reasons than, for example, lack of time. From
their point of view, knowledge can be divided into two different definitions, which are:
1) Known knowledge, when the individual knows she or he knows, and
2) Unknown knowledge, when the individual does not know she or he knows, since
it has blended into her or his way of working.
However, knowledge sharing applies to both of these types. In other words, that is done
either by helping the individuals to share their knowledge they know or by helping the
individuals to articulate and share what they do not know they know (Bukowitz &
Williams, 1999).

13

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

In summary, knowledge can be sorted in many ways and, as discussed above, its
formation and perceptions of it vary. For this thesis, it is important to consider different
definitions of knowledge in order to gain an understanding of how it can be better shared
and utilized in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For clarity, in this thesis,
organization and company are used as synonyms for SME and vice versa. However,
according to many researchers, knowledge sharing is not straightforward action and, in
addition, tacit knowledge and know-how requires more effort to disseminate than explicit
knowledge (Foss et al., 2010; Osterloh & Frey, 2000; Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016).
Therefore, the concept of knowledge sharing is further explored in the following section.

2.2 Knowledge Sharing
2.2.1 Knowledge Sharing as a Concept
In its simplest form, knowledge sharing can be defined as transferring or sharing
individual’s or organization’s tacit or explicit knowledge to another human or company
database (Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016; Szulanski, 1996). As discussed more broadly in
section 2.1.3, tacit and explicit knowledge can be; for example, data, information, or
individual’s know-how, skills, experiences and feelings (Bukowitz & Williams, 1999;
Dalkir, 2011; Virtainlahti, 2009). It is observed that knowledge is human in nature, and
its commitment to individuals makes its management substantially more difficult than its
management of lower levels of knowledge, data and information (Laihonen et al. 2013).
Furthermore, communication interaction and knowledge sharing in the work environment
is initiated to perform and solve work tasks (Widén-Wuff, 2007).
Moreover, knowledge sharing is the cornerstone of knowledge creation, because without
knowledge sharing, it is almost impossible to create knowledge (Pinho et al., 2012).
According to the knowledge-based view, which is used in this study, as knowledge is
transferred or shared, it always changes, too (Szulanski, 1996). Hence, knowledge is
constantly re-evaluated in interpersonal interactions and, thus, the change in knowledge
is in a way included for all forms of knowledge use and sharing (Szulanski, 1996; WidénWuff, 2007). Useless information and knowledge should not be collected and shared, but
the necessary knowledge should be shared as efficiently as possible (Laihonen et al.,
2013). According to Jantunen (2005), it is important to remember that knowledge

14

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

becomes obsolete and, therefore organizations must monitor and update their knowledge
base effectively. This often also means that the organization must internalize the new
knowledge produced, and then integrate new insights into the existing knowledge base
(Jantunen, 2005). This, of course requires skilled personnel and holistic understanding of
what is relevant information and what is not (Laihonen, et al., 2013).
Typically, knowledge sharing occurs throughout the organization in both random and
planned situations (Ghobadi & Mathiassen, 2014). These situations often involve a place,
space, or a system, where employees in an organization meet, either face to face or
electronically (Dalkir, 2011; Ghobadi & Mathiassen, 2014). The movement of knowledge
and the important role of knowledge sharing and dissemination in the formation and
application of knowledge is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. The Integrated KM Cycle, in which Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination Play a Key
Role. Developed from Dalkir (2011, p. 142).

Knowledge sharing can improve all levels of an organization’s operations, since its
sharing and exchanging enhances an organization’s learning competence and ability to
achieve personal and organizational goals (Lin, 2007). Moreover, the studies in the field
have presented that knowledge sharing increases both performance and innovativeness of
an organization and, in particular, plays a key role in ensuring the continuity and success
of an organization (Dalkir, 2011; Janus, 2016; Kuitunen, 2020; Laihonen et al., 2013;

15

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Virtainlahti, 2009). However, unfortunately, the management of an organization often
does not understand what actions are required to share knowledge in practice within the
organization. Typically, companies collect large amounts of data, information and
knowledge with great effort and money, but cannot or do not know how to utilize it
(Dalkir, 2011; Janus, 2016; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
Consequently, there is a growing need in modern organizations to understand what
actions are needed to promote the exchange and sharing of knowledge (Davenport &
Prusak, 1998; Janus, 2016; Solovjew-Wartiovaara, 2019). This also applies to the use of
terms related to knowledge sharing, such as knowledge transfer and exchange, which are
often misused or misunderstood to mean the same as knowledge sharing. However, in
order to make the knowledge sharing in an SME as efficient and understandable as
possible, it is necessary to clarify the differences between the terms of knowledge sharing,
transfer and exchange, and are briefly clarified next in more detail.

2.2.2 The Relationship Between Knowledge Transfer, Sharing, and
Exchange
According to Janus (2016), knowledge transfer means the transfer of existing knowledge
as such to another location or to another person. Typically, one-way knowledge sharing
often refers to the transfer of data. For example, the data is transferred from one database
to another, from one person to database, or from one person to person, but without their
actual discussion or learning from another (Janus, 2016).
Knowledge exchange and knowledge sharing stands for the mutual sharing of knowledge
that involves the idea of learning from each other (Janus, 2016) which ideally leads to
relevant knowledge transfer between individuals (Henttonen et al., 2016). Therefore,
knowledge sharing, and knowledge exchange are understood to be two-way or multidirectional (Janus, 2016). Similarly, according to Lin (2007), the difference between
knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange is that knowledge exchange is generally
expected to be beneficial, while knowledge sharing does not directly include benefit
inclusion.

16

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

All in all, it is known that a good work community is created as a result of good
communication (Juholin, 2009) and effective interaction is the starting point for good
knowledge management (Väisänen, 2019) and a prerequisite for knowledge sharing,
transfer and exchange (Lin, 2007; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Wendelin, 2013). Knowledge
sharing is rarely a separate function in an organization, but it is intertwined with other
knowledge processes including knowledge ﬂow, transfer, learning, distributed
collaboration and knowledge creation (Foss et al., 2010). Hence, different terms are used
to describe the movement of knowledge in different contexts (Lin, 2007; Janus, 2016). In
addition, according to Solovjew-Vartiovaara (2019), an effective decision making is best
achieved in organizations when the use of knowledge is designed to fit and be appropriate
to the situation. This means that the ways in which knowledge is used and shared must
be compatible with the nature of the phenomena or problems being addressed (SolovjewVartiovaara, 2019). For this reason, knowledge sharing, and knowledge management
must be at the heart of the organization (Dalkir, 2011) and the next section deals with the
concept of knowledge management.

2.3 Management of Knowledge Sharing
2.3.1 Knowledge Management as a Concept
Owing to the multidisciplinary nature of knowledge, which is introduced in many ways
in previous section 2.1., there is no common and unambiguous definition of knowledge
management, either (Dalkir, 2011; Hellström, Ikäheimo, Hakapää, Lehtomäki & Saari,
2019). Therefore, as knowledge management can be interpreted in different contexts and
perspectives as a broad and complex phenomenon and, thus, its content is more important
than the term (Laihonen et al., 2013). Although knowledge management is a relatively
recent concept, it has been studied for a long time. In recent decades, the emphasis in the
literature has been specifically on managing knowledge and knowledge sharing, in
people-to-people interactions in organizations and between its stakeholders (Nonaka,
2007; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). In this study, knowledge management is understood as an
entirety that examines the activities of organizations and the phenomena related to
management and development from the perspective of knowledge-related resources,
processes, and technologies (Laihonen et al., 2013), which also enables successful
decision making through knowledge (Solovjew-Wartiovaara, 2019).

17

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

From an organizational perspective, knowledge management is associated with
knowledge acquisition, creation, coding and sharing (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
Knowledge management seeks to control and establish organizations operations for the
best possible outcome, and it is argued that effective knowledge management may lift the
organization to the horizon of success (Asrar-ul-Haq & Answar, 2016; Dalkir, 2011;
Hislop, 2013; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Additionally, knowledge management aims to
apply and add knowledge to the decision making situations (Sydänmaalakka, 2012;
Solovjew-Vartiovaara, 2019). Therefore, it is important to distinguish between the aims
of knowledge management and management through knowledge, as the term knowledge
management refers to both the management of knowledge resources. For example,
learning of an organization and creation of new knowledge, and also to the management
through knowledge such as the ways in which organizational knowledge is processed and
utilized in the management of an organization’s operations (Laihonen et al., 2013).
If an organization does not have an explicit knowledge management policy, knowledge
sharing practices is often difficult, unclear and incidental (Rossignoli, 2017). Therefore,
it is imperative that the organization’s knowledge management strategy is integrated and
managed from its business strategy (Hislop, 2013; Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019;
Vuorinen, 2013). Additionally, due to the multifacial nature of knowledge management,
organization needs to develop a workable knowledge sharing strategy that is based on the
goals of the company (Bukowitz & Williams, 1999). In addition, when an organization
learns, remembers and acts based on the best available information, knowledge, and
know-how, it can be said that organization has embraced knowledge management at its
core function (Dalkir, 2011).

Leadership and Management
The concepts of leadership and management have practical differences, but are similar in
many ways as leadership and management are two distinctive and complementary
systems of action (Kotter, 1990). In the words, according to Kotter (1990, p. 103), “a
good management controls the complexity, where an effective leadership produces useful
change”. This means that management is responsible for organizing and staffing the
practices and procedures of organizations while, by contrast, leadership is more about
setting a direction and developing a vision of the company’s future. Typically,

18

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

management ensures the day-to-day monitoring and problem solving of the organization
and, thus, this research emphasizes the management perspective (Kotter, 1990).
However, this study does not focus on the differences of leadership and management in
greater detail than it is necessary for the purposes of this study. For clarity, this study
refers to the concept of management, even if discussing changes, methods, and strategies
to achieve a vision for the future.

Knowledge Management Methods
Knowledge management has been assessed and measured through a number of different
approaches and metrics in the literature and arguably there are many ways to manage
knowledge in the organizations. As mentioned before in section 2.1., knowledge is
invisible, non-touchable and, thus, difficult to measure. First and foremost, it is
impossible to lead anything one does not know anything about and, thus, modern
management must be knowledge-based (Rytilä, 2011). No leader is that talented to lead
workforce without knowing and no worker is capable to do her or his work without the
knowledge (Hislop, 2013). Over the years several studies have highlighted that
organizations must understand the significance of knowledge as a resource for business
management (Nonaka, 2007), as it has been noted that knowledge management is in the
key role in developing the strategy to benefit the organization (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
According to both Laihonen et al. (2013) and Solovjew-Vartiovaara (2019), when
choosing a model for the organizational knowledge management, there is no one-sizefits-all approach that suits in every situation. Instead, the choice of the model that best
suits the situation depends on whether new solutions are sought, old conflicts are resolved,
or whether the aim is to map a common picture of the existing situation. Thus, knowledge
management models can and usually are used simultaneously for several different
functions of an organization. Due to the immateriality of knowledge, different levels of
knowledge are difficult to manage and control and typically, many of the methods are
used simultaneously (Laihonen et al. 2013; Solovjew-Vartiovaara, 2019).
Correspondingly, Ruggles (1999) is convinced that through more deliberate management
would make it possible to utilize the existing knowledge in the organization to a higher
level. She continues, that in order to do so, it is necessary to understand what that,

19

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

knowledge, is that actually gets managed in organization (Ruggles, 1999). Therefore,
Ruggles (1999) identifies eight factors related to knowledge development that should be
considered in an organization, when defining knowledge management, which are as
follows:
1) Creating knowledge,
2) Sources of external knowledge,
3) Use of knowledge in decision making,
4) Integrating knowledge into business processes and products and services,
5) Presentation of knowledge in documents and databases,
6) Supporting knowledge through culture and incentives,
7) Transferring existing knowledge to others in the organization, and
8) Measuring the value and benefits of knowledge and supervisor evaluation
(Ruggles, 1999, p. 81)
According to Sydänmaanlakka (2012), the starting point for knowledge management is
an analysis of the current situation of the organization. An extensive analysis is needed
of where the key elements, level of performance, know-how and knowledge of the
organization are clarified. Key issues can include questions such as:
•

Is there enough knowledge?

•

Is the knowledge created effectively?

•

Is there a sufficient amount of external information?

•

Is there an ability to store data, information and knowledge?

•

How well knowledge is shared and transferred?

•

How is the knowledge applied?

•

Is there the ability to re-use the existing knowledge within the organization?
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).

Another way to map the needs for knowledge management practices is to use the
knowledge auditing (Daghfous, Ahmad, Angell, 2013). According to Serrat (2009)
knowledge auditing has multiple purposes, but it can provide tangible evidence about the
current state of an organization’s knowledge. Hence, knowledge auditing can be used to
obtain answers to important questions, such as what knowledge an organization needs,
where that knowledge is, how it is being used, what problems and difficulties exist, and

20

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

what improvements can be made. Typically, the query varies according to the needs of
the organization and, for example, may include the following questions:
•

What are an organization’s knowledge needs?

•

What tacit and explicit knowledge assets does it have and where are they?

•

How does knowledge flow within the organization, formally and informally, and
to and from clients and relevant organizations?

•

How is that knowledge identified, created, stored, shared, and used?

•

What obstacles are there to knowledge flows, e.g., to what extent do its people,
business processes, and technology currently support or hamper the effective
movement of knowledge?

•

What gaps and duplications exist in the organization’s knowledge? (Serrat, 2009).

How knowledge sharing can then be led is one of the key issues for any business and
organizations. The research in the literature has shown that tacit knowledge involves more
effort to share and, thus, may require more or, at least, different incentives to share than
explicit knowledge (Foss et al., 2010). Moreover, employees’ knowledge-sharing
intentions vary, depending on whether the knowledge is tacit or explicit (Hau et al., 2013).
In other words, sharing tacit knowledge might be less dependent on external incentives
and is mainly driven by individuals’ motivation (Osterloh & Frey, 2000; Seergeva &
Andreeva, 2016).
Hislop (2013) defines that knowledge can be shared internally using either push or a pull
strategy.
•

In a push-strategy, knowledge is pushed to the employees through various
methods, for example through storytelling, intranet, and newsletters.

•

In a pull-strategy, employees search for the knowledge they need themselves. The
knowledge, of course, can be anything, such as improving one’s Excel-skills via
YouTube-videos.

However, both strategies are utilized simultaneously in the organizations. Managers must
decide which knowledge sharing strategy works best for them and, on which issue and,
in general what are the most suitable mechanisms in place to optimize knowledge sharing
(Hislop, 2013).

21

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

According to Davenport and Prusak (1998, p. 88), the answer to the question of how
knowledge sharing can be developed to be more and more effective in the organization,
is as follows: “The short answer, and the best one, is: hire smart people and let them talk
to one another. Unfortunately, the second part of this advice is the more difficult to put
into practice”. Indeed, employees are in central role when talking about gaining, using
and sharing knowledge in organization (Janus, 2016; Stary et al., 2008). Hence, effective
knowledge sharing is challenging because employees cannot be forced to share their
knowledge (Amayah, 2013) and, ultimately, employees themselves decide whether to
share their knowledge (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). By nature, knowledge is human, and
its commitment to individuals makes its management much more difficult than managing
data and information (Henttonen et al., 2016). In addition, it is hard to know who knows
what, and what kind of or how relevant the knowledge is (Laihonen et al. 2013).
To conclude, there is an infinite number of factors to consider when deciding which
method suits best for the knowledge management of an organization. The factors, such as
structure, size, and cultural diversity of an organization are likely to have a significant
impact on organization’s effort to manage knowledge (Hislop, 2013). Correspondingly,
the value of knowledge is realized when the information is utilized, that is, when the
knowledge is used to guide activities at either the individual or the organizational level
(Laihonen et al., 2013). It is further argued that an organization’s agility is based on its
knowledge management and the ability to change (Savolainen &Lehmuskorpi, 2017;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). Therefore, knowledge management and, similarly, knowledge
sharing as a one core operation of knowledge management, is important for organizations
to better manage change (Savolainen &Lehmuskorpi, 2017). The next section describes
change management in more detail.

2.3.2 Change Management
It is evident that we are living in the era of changes. Regardless of the decade, the
momentum of change has never been greater than it is in the current business environment
(Burnes, 2004; March, 1981; Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017; Todnem, 2005;
Vuorinen, 2013). As stated by Sydänmaanlakka (2012, p. 13) “Continuous renewal of
individuals, teams and companies is the only lasting competitive advantage”. More than
20 years ago, Burnes (1996) stated that the ability to manage change is recognized as a

core organizational competence. Whether we like it or not, change occurs in all its forms
and affects organizations in all areas (Burnes, 1996). In traditional fields in particular, the
challenge is that many organizations have the illusion of being immune to or protected
from change (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017). Therefore, organizations must learn
how to cope with change, regardless of the industry they are in, since modern leadership
is, in practice, management of change (Sydänmaanlakka, 2014; Todnem, 2005;
Wendelin, 2013).
The challenge in change management is that renewals and change require the
management of both current and future business simultaneously (Mitronen &
Raikaslehto, 2019). Mitronen & Raikaslehto (2019) continues that a recent research
around the topic revealed that almost all medium-sized companies have emphasized the
importance of reform and future change. However, according to Burnes (2004), over 60
per cent of all change projects are considered to fail. This is explained by the fact that
besides understanding the company’s own processes, organizations need to be constantly
aware of both the development of their competitors and the direct and indirect changes in
the operating environment (Burnes, 2004). According to Mitronen and Raikaslehto
(2019), predicting and forecasting the future is difficult. Therefore, today it is no longer
possible to make a development plan, for example for five or even for three years, and
then stubbornly stick to it (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019).

Changed Role of Management and Employees
According to March (1981) no magic tricks are needed to succeed and cope with change.
Instead, it requires ordinary people to do ordinary things in the most competent way
(March, 1981). Similarly, according to Sydänmaanlakka (2017), change must be brought
into the organization, embedded in policies and put into practice. However, organizational
change is often a longer process than first thought (Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). Permanent
change is implemented by taking into account both the people and the business, so both
emotions and causes must to be considered at the same time (Henttonen et al., 2016;
Juholin, 2009; Wendelin, 2013). More specifically, there are many types of resistance of
change, but they all can be tackled by solid and exemplary leadership and, thus, by
influencing others (Wendelin, 2013). Therefore, it is particularly important that the
management is committed to change (Sydänmaanlakka, 2014). As stated by Savolainen
and Lehmuskoski (2017), one of the most important things in the turmoil of
23

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

organizational change is that the roles and responsibilities of the company are clear.
Hence, the organization must decide who is responsible for managing knowledge
(Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017).
In particular in a state of change, is important to speak out loud even difficult things and
communicate openly about what is happening and when. In today’s organization, people
want to know what is going on (Järvinen, 2019). In general, managing change is not easy
and communication plays a major role in change (Juholin, 2009; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
Anything that has not been yet communicated is also a message from something
(Kuitunen, 2020; Wendelin, 2013). In the midst of change, typically, people desire for
three things, such as:
•

Predictability,
information about where we are going and where we are heading,

•

Observing one’s own abilities,
knowing what different qualities will be required in the future, and

•

Concrete tools,
information and knowledge on how to succeed and how to reach the new goals
(Wendelin, 2013).

Both knowledge management and change management has a significant role in creating
a work environment that encourages people to share knowledge, and integrate knowledge
within the organization and, thus, to produce useful knowledge that can be used within
the organization (Pinho et al., 2012). However, collaboration is a must in today’s
contemporary organization. That means that the role of leadership is changed and can be
seen as a shared task along every participant of a company (Kuitunen, 2020;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). If both parties are willing to work together, there will be no such
confrontation between ‘we’ and ‘they’ (Kuitunen, 2020). According to Järvinen (2019),
the leader has a lot more expectations than before and nowadays one must be a versatile
leader. In addition, the distance between the supervisor and the employees has changed.
Nowadays, the managerial task is no longer related to position of the status but is much
more equal and diverse as it was, for example, in the 1980s (Järvinen, 2019).
Moreover, it can be said that in contemporary organizations, the ability to organize work
and the flow of knowledge is part of an individual’s professional competence (Hellsten,
24

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

1998). Furthermore, the employees are expected to be able to prioritize and organize their
own tasks, and accordingly, managers and supervisors are expected to be able to make
effective use of the work input of individuals (Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006). In this
context one can also speak of an individual’s so-called self-management skills and the
individual’s own role and responsibility as a distributor of knowledge (Hellsten, 1998;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2017; Wendelin, 2017). However, more specific discussion of how to
improve employees’ knowledge sharing skills and practices in organizations, whether it
is tacit or explicit knowledge, is presented in section 2.1.3.
Conversely, according to Järvinen (2019), many supervisors are afraid of their role as
authority users and even form close relationships with employees, which in turn can
create conflicts in the work community. In other words, a certain distance is needed, but
finding the right distance to employees is another challenge in modern management and
leadership (Järvinen, 2019). The organizational design, the way the tasks are divided and
coordinated, affects by creating or reducing opportunities for knowledge sharing
(Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016). Therefore, the best way to avoid collisions and overlaps
is to have clear processes and rules, that are explicitly discussed throughout the
organization (Järvinen, 2019). According to Kuitunen (2020), with clear responsibilities
and roles for management and employees, ease and fluidity are achieved. Moreover,
employees have their own responsibility to collectively take care of their own attitudes
and thus improve the work community (Kuitunen, 2020).
Furthermore, adaptiveness to organizational change can and should be managed (March,
1981). Therefore, in particular, organizations need to pay attention to their employees in
organizational changes, as they are affected by the changes and, after the changes, they
are also the actual end-users with the reforms (Razmerita et. al., 2016). For example,
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs or Maslow to Aldefer’s the three needs of an individual can
also help to better understand people’s thoughts and action in a changing situation
(Barachini, 2009). Knowledge and the flow of knowledge is a key factor in carrying out
a successful change project, and the importance of communication and knowledge
sharing cannot be overemphasized (Sydänmaanlakka, 2014; Wendelin, 2013). Indeed,
according to Juholin (2009), people are committed to change through an open and honest
communication. For instance, communication affects staff turnover (Wendelin, 2013).

25

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Hence, correct, up-to-date knowledge and knowledge sharing processes are central in
change management processes (Juholin, 2009; Wendelin, 2013).
Typically, people want things around them to change but they either do not know how to
change themselves, or simply do not want to change themselves (Savolainen &
Lehmuskoski, 2017). According to Hellsten (1998), people only change when they are
forced to change. This is because change is a new unknown area and it scares and
potentially hurts. (Hellsten, 1998) Even though people accept change, they want it to
happen on their own terms (Wendelin, 2013). According to Piderit (2000), from the
viewpoint of the organization, resistance of change is easily seen as negative rebellion.
However, resisting change and expressing ambivalence can create a dialogue and, thus,
encourage for an ongoing discussion. This kind of discussion can be fruitful for
organizational development and, therefore, resisting change is also valuable in identifying
potential areas for improvement (Piderit, 2000).
In conclusion, managing change is not an easy task in today’s contemporary organization
as managing existing business and renewal processes at the same time requires new kinds
of talents from both the leaders and employees (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019;
Pirkkalainen et al., 2017; Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). Therefore, multidirectional
communication, knowledge sharing, collaboration, and taking people, their emotions and
needs into account are in a key position in change management (Juholin, 2009; Wendelin,
2013; Henttonen et al., 2016).

3 INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SHARING PRACTICES
Factors influencing the flow of knowledge have been studied in different studies and
organizations. However, only a few recent studies have combined both the literature on
knowledge sharing practises and mapping the knowledge sharing practices within a reallife organization context (Widén, 2017). Nevertheless, as stated in previous Chapter 2, it
is difficult for organizations to enable effective knowledge sharing practices among
employees owing to human factors, institutional complexities, and the tacit nature of
knowledge itself (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al., 2013; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Wang &
Hou; 2015). However, understanding the knowledge sharing behaviors of real-life
organizations and the factors that influence the knowledge sharing practices can provide
the most value for the organizations (Kuttner et al., 2013; Razmerita et al., 2016).
This chapter focuses on the key issues of this study and sheds light on the theoretical
background of the organizational and individual factors that influence organizations’
internal communication and knowledge sharing practices. Although organization’s
external actions and knowledge sharing are also important, this study emphasizes only
the aspects of the organization’s internal knowledge sharing. The following sections first
describe the organizational factors and later the individual factors of the internal
knowledge sharing practices of the organization. The following chapter answers the
second and third supportive research questions, ‘What organizational and individual
factors influence the internal knowledge sharing practices?’ and ‘How can internal
knowledge sharing practices and knowledge management be developed within a SME?’.

3.1 Organizational Factors
Prior research has shown that knowledge sharing practices must be supported by the
organization (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al., 2013; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Widén, 2017),
as the organizational factors that either enables or hinders knowledge transfer within the
organization (Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar, 2016).) Besides the important role of both
knowledge management and change management that are presented in the previous
Chapter 2, the organizational culture, norms, values, and incentives of the organization
have a significant impact on the organizational knowledge sharing factors. (Wendelin,
2013; Asrar-ul-Haq and Anwar, 2016). Moreover, the latest technology is needed to
27

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

support functioning knowledge sharing and its management (Hislop, 2013; Janus, 2016;
Pirkkalainen et al., 2017). The digitalization and the IT architecture of an organization
needs to be designed in a holistic way to enable knowledge to flow seamlessly across
applications and, thus, between people (Razmerita et al., 2016; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012;
Vuori, Helander & Okkonen, 2018). The next section addresses these issues in more
detail.

3.1.1 Organizational Culture, Atmosphere, and Values
From the knowledge management perspective, creating an organizational culture and
atmosphere that support knowledge sharing is one of the key enablers for knowledge
sharing in an organization (Järvinen, 2019; Wendelin, 2013). In addition, values are an
important part of a company’s internal and external communication (Sydänmaanlakka
2012; Wendelin, 2013). Conversely, the own and shared values of the members of an
organization affect the atmosphere of the work environment and, thus, affect the
organizational culture (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Next, the concepts of organizational
culture, atmosphere, and values are defined.

Definition of Organizational Culture
Organizational culture is a very broad concept, as it includes a set of shared values,
attitudes, beliefs, goals, habits, and practices, and it can be seen as a system of seeking of
meanings and sharing experiences (Wendelin, 2013). Organizational culture can also be
considered as the intellectual structure of the work community, which is expressed
through values, customs, norms, products and services, symbols, or in language used in
an organization (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Organizational culture extends to all
aspects of the organization (Janus, 2016), and organizational culture also affects directly
to the productivity of the work community (Wendelin, 2013).
Organizational culture plays a crucial role in the change and in knowledge management
and the organizational culture should be based on the organization’s strategy (Kuitunen,
2020; Vuorinen, 2013; Wendelin, 2013). ‘Culture eats strategy for breakfast’ is a general
saying that emphasizes the great role of culture in an organization that either supports or
limits the implementation of a strategy, even the best strategy bends in front of the
organizational culture (Kuitunen, 2020 ; Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019; Wendelin, 2013).

28

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

According to Kuitunen (2020), if the culture is in accordance with the organization’s
strategy, there should not be a need to manage the culture. When developing a strategy,
one should consider whether this is in line with the company culture and vice versa
(Kuitunen, 2020; Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019).

Definition of Atmosphere
Organizational culture also encompasses the concept of atmosphere, which is in a way
an intangible part of the work environment and its culture (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
According to Järvinen (2019), cultural formation of an organization is often a
subconscious process that arises already in the early days of the workplace. Hence, even
though the people in an organization change, the organizational culture typically remains
the same (Järvinen, 2019). Culture can be thought the driving force ‘below the surface’
behind the company and its employees and other stakeholders, while the atmosphere
interacts with the culture, and is a more visible and more easily changing part of the
organization’s operations (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Wendelin, 2013). Correspondingly,
organizational culture includes what is experienced and said both officially and
unofficially (Kuitunen, 2020). Therefore, above all, organizational culture is everything
what is not been said (Kuitunen, 2020; Wendelin, 2013).

Definition of Values
In addition, the values of an organization are the main guiding principles of the
organization’s operations, which are often culturally bound (Razmerita et al., 2016; Wang
& Hou, 2015; Wendelin, 2013). Furthermore, the organizational values guide human
behavior (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987) and, thus, the values guide what to do and how to
behave and people more likely behave in a way that is beneficial to them, that is, towards
the things valued by the organization (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019; Wang & Hou,
2015). Additionally, the managers’ behavior and actions influence to the company values
and norms. Hence, if the manager behaves and acts differently as the organization’s
values, then the manager’s behavior becomes the new norm in the organizational culture
(Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019).

Improving Organizational Culture and Atmosphere
However, organization’s culture can be managed and changed (Järvinen, 2019; Mitronen
& Raikaslehto, 2019; Wendelin, 2013). Organizational culture defines the value of

29

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

knowledge (Okkonen et al., 2018) and it manifests itself through the behavior of the
people in the organization (Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar, 2016). Correspondingly, an efficient
organization is characterized by a performance-oriented and people-centered atmosphere
(Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Järvinen (2019) states that the two important things in
building a successful organizational culture are an interactive dialogue and getting people
involved in building the culture. Transparency in all actions also plays an important role
in all performance-oriented and people-centered companies (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987).
According to Peltonen and Ruohotie (1987), a performance-driven atmosphere influences
work performance and productivity, in which managers play a crucial role. What matters
is the extent to which subordinates are able to participate and influence the workplace
environment, how they identify with their work, and how they are aware of their
responsibilities in achieving the goals of the organization or the unit (Peltonen &
Ruohotie, 1987). According to both Janus (2016) and Wendelin (2013), the organization’s
culture of sharing knowledge starts from the top, but it is common for leaders to also need
coaching to share knowledge. Management must promote the value of knowledge sharing
by modelling best-practice behavior. As employees discover how the managers in the
organization encourage, recognize, and reward knowledge sharing, also their attitude
toward knowledge sharing practices improves. Additionally, in this way, employees are
more likely to follow the example of the leaders (Janus, 2016; Wendelin, 2013).
Thus, at first, a truthful mapping of the current situation helps to identify the problem
areas and, second, practical changes and actions are needed (Mitronen & Raikaslehto,
2019; Wendelin, 2013). According to Wendelin (2013), by identifying the so-called
intellectual cultural spaces of the work community, the challenges of organizational
culture and its productivity can be better managed. The different work communities with
different organizational cultures can be classified, for example, as follows:
•

In an anemic culture, the leadership has lost control and their courage to change
things. In this kind of culture knowledge does not flow, there are no clear goals or
at least lack of communication and discussion about them.

•

In a club-style culture, things look good outward, but they are not. For example,
a feedback culture and the mutual trust should improve. In this kind of culture, the
problems are not directly addressed and there is a lot of room for improvement in

30

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

transparency. Thus, such a culture easily blinds to its built-in shell and the issues
are not really developed.
•

In a culture of performance pressure, the feeling of rush and a constant result
pressure plays a big role. Employees are not satisfied as they are feeling lack of
appreciation and have no time to really recover or energy to innovate anything
new.

•

In a culture of productivity, efficiency and job satisfaction, people are valued from
their resources, and simultaneously there is both enough communication in
management and focus on performance. In this kind of culture, it is understood
that feedback is the only opportunity for growth, and to enable it, trust is
maintained among staff. Moreover, the functionality of the processes does not
determine the culture, but that the most significant impact on the success of the
organizational culture is its people and their well-being (Wendelin, 2013).

The organizational culture that encourages the interactivity of tacit knowledge also
enables continuous renewal of the organization (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). The flow of
knowledge within an organization from the individual to the community and through its
levels is critical to the organizational culture because it enables the creation of new
meanings and innovations (Janus, 2016; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). According to Gruber
and Duxbury (2000) as cited in Dalkir (2011), suggest that an environment that truly
supports the sharing of knowledge has payed attention to the following characteristics:
•

Reward structure, with the recognition for knowledge sharing with peers,

•

Openness and transparency, with no hidden agendas,

•

Sharing is supported, so that communication and coordination happens between
groups,

•

Trust, as the organization has shared objectives, and

•

Top management support, meaning upward and downward communication
(Gruber and Duxbury, 2000, as cited in Dalkir, 2011).

From an organizational development perspective, it is essential to understand that
sustainable change is better achieved by focusing on cultural norms and values, rather
than on the factors that temporarily shape the work environment and its atmosphere
(Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). However, a positive atmosphere for knowledge sharing

31

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

and, thus, can contribute and create a basis for cultural change (Janus, 2016).
Furthermore, an open and transparent culture increases the effectiveness of knowledge
sharing. Improving the utilization of knowledge offers a real competitive advantage,
especially for companies operating in rapidly changing markets (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
Similarly, according to Kuitunen (2020), an organizational culture is what you get the
people to think, and it is not directly measurable, although it is often thought so.
As discussed in the section 2.3.1., knowledge management aims to create an environment
that encourages people to share knowledge and learn by harmonizing goals and
combining knowledge within and across the organization, and to produce information and
knowledge that is useful to the organization (Foss et al., 2010; Hislop, 2013; Janus, 2016;
Widén-Wuff, 2007). As stated by Wendelin (2013), giving and receiving feedback is
important and it should be an integral part of the day-to-day dialogue of the work
community. According to Sydänmaanlakka (2012), nowadays it is a trend to seek and
receive feedback from as many directions as possible. A so-called 360-degree feedback
has become more common, which at the individual level means that feedback is gained
from the supervisor, subordinates, colleagues and possibly other stakeholders. At the
company level, it is typical to regularly monitor at least the development of the customer
satisfaction and the employees’ job satisfaction (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
Implementing feedback systems requires a certain feedback culture and an operating
model with associated values (Wendelin, 2013). Therefore, a functioning feedback
culture is made up of factors such as openness, trust, respect for the individual, abundant
communication, tolerance of mistakes, good fellowship, support for others, and emphasis
on continuous learning (Kuitunen, 2020; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Moreover, gaining
feedback is the best way to increase organizational knowledge and so-called social capital
(Amayah, 2013; Widén-Wuff, 2007) The feedback system will not work without
management’s support and the management must ensure that employees have time and
space to give feedback as well as report inappropriateness (Kuitunen, 2020). In addition,
the management of a company must also be prepared to receive critical feedback
(Järvinen, 2019).
In summary, an organizational culture is more powerful than the organization’s strategy,
as the culture is a crucial part of the community success story and, thus, it determines

32

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

what is important (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019; Wendelin, 2013). Moreover, the
organizational culture has direct impact on the organization’s atmosphere (Järvinen,
2019), which in return has a direct impact on employees’ knowledge sharing behavior
(Amayah, 2013; Wang & Hau, 2015) and on individual’s work motivation (Okkonen et
al., 2018; Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Knowledge sharing, and communication plays a
major role in an organizational culture, and organizational values are an important part of
the organizational culture (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). All development starts with
communication and the flow of knowledge (Juholin, 2009). It is the top management’s
and superior’s responsibility to change culture, act consistently, and besides creating rules
and models, to be an example for others (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Järvinen, 2019). In
addition, the tools that are used to control and accelerate the knowledge flows, must suit
the organization (Hislop, 2013). Therefore, next the role of digitalization and technology
in organization’s knowledge sharing practices are clarified.

3.1.2 Technology and Digitalization
According to many authors (e.g. (Hislop, 2013; Janus, 2016; Kuettner et al, 2013;
Razmerita et al., 2016; Vuori et al., 2019), information and communication technologies
(ICTs) have always played a prominent role in knowledge management processes and
research. The significant role of ICTs is due to the following two reasons:
1. First, as ICT became more widespread, there was a general optimism about how
much organizational knowledge could be codified, stored in, and distributed
through ICTs.
2. Second, it was thought that simply implementing a relevant ICT system would
lead to successful management of knowledge.
Obviously, over time, both assumptions have been questioned and challenged (Hislop,
2013).
Moreover, there is a lot of discussion about digitalization and how important it is for
organizations to go digital (Savolainen & Lehmuskorpi, 2017). The growth of data,
combined with the development of data analytics and artificial intelligence, creates hope
for increasingly agile operating methods and services tailored for individual needs
(Hellström et al., 2019; Jousilahti et al., 2019). However, it is not worth focusing solely
on these issues, but it is important to explore how digital tools and technologies can
improve organizational performance (Hellström et al., 2019). It seems that the
33

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

organizations have forgotten what digitalization really is (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski,
2017).
Technology is a collective term for a set of technologies in a particular field or in a
company (Vuori et al., 2019). Digitalization means the technological possibilities by
which better performance in organizations may be achieved (Savolainen & Lehmuskorpi,
2017). In terms of the company productivity, technology is connected to self-efficacy, as
the ability to use or utilize technology has a great impact to productivity (Vuori et al.,
2019). Change management is one very important part of any digital transformation in
organization (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017). Other authors agree the importance of
change management. For example, both Kuettner et al. (2013) and Razmerita et al. (2016)
establish that behavioral change and change management is required for successful
implementation of knowledge sharing practices through new systems. Furthermore,
besides management support, training and reward systems, guidelines for contributions
and an assigned responsible person is needed when implementing new technologies
(Razmerita et al., 2016).
However, as it has been shown many times, the new information technologies are not the
answer to more efficient management of information and knowledge (Janus, 2016;
Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017). Indeed, existing IT solutions enable efficient data,
information and knowledge collection, storage, and processing (Janus, 2016), but the
adoption of technologies or new practices is relatively poor, if the organization culture
and management does not support positive attitude toward the new tools and practices
(Hislop, 2013; Widén, 2017). Correspondingly, Kuttner et al. (2013) investigated the
factors that influence in organizations especially, when implementing new technologies.
They found that major categories that affect were:
•

Prerequisites, such as management and its involvement and support, open minded
culture,

•

Measures, such as implementation strategy, user training, and regulations, and

•

Implications, such as user acceptance, design of processes and access
management, and individual’s benefits (Kuttner et al., 2013).

Knowledge sharing involves the exploitation of both personal and collective information
and can be significantly facilitated by the introduction of organizational technology

34

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

platforms (Razmerita et al. 2016). The rise of social software has increased the company’s
rapid adoption of collaboration technologies in organizations. However, the
implementing of new technology requires always change and, unfortunately also often
challenges (Kuettner et al. 2013). It is obvious that no information is shared in an
organization, if there is no possibility to do so (Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). Employees need
to have the ability to participate in knowledge sharing discussions and management must
provide the right tools and framework for knowledge sharing discussions (Dalkir, 2011;
Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Janus, 2016). According to Hislop (2013) two main
conclusions can be drawn from ICT-enabled knowledge management initiatives.
1) First, simply putting an ICT-based knowledge management system in place is not
in and of itself going to make the people utilize it.
2) Second, the success of all knowledge management initiatives, whether they utilize
ICTs or not, involves effectively taking account of the socio-cultural factors which
influence people’s willingness to share knowledge, such as conflict, trust, time or
concerns about loss of status (Hislop, 2013).
On the other hand, according to Pirkkalainen et al. (2017), today the ever-increasing
amount of technological systems has increased tiredness or even fatigue or exhaustion
towards new technological systems. This is a well-known phenomenon in today’s
organizations, regardless of job description. In other words, the constant connectivity and
“always-on” mentality affect personal achievement and performance negatively, further
causing also negative emotions (Pirkkalainen et al., 2017). This has increased the
importance of the role of education in companies (Razmerita et al., 2016). The ability to
take others’ perspective and knowledge into account is been identified as a key
prerequisite in development of information systems (Laihonen et al., 2013). In addition,
guidelines for reward systems in organizations should exist (Razmerita et al., 2016).
In a summary, to run and manage organizational processes, organizations need to operate
with many different information systems that generate huge volumes of varied data.
Hence, traditional business intelligence and database tools are rarely suitable for big data
adoption (Burmeister et al., 2018). Additionally, geographical dispersed teams are
becoming more and more common and technology and digitalization enables
interpersonal communication and collaboration (Hislop, 2013). In addition, besides
understanding the business and its management, there is also a growing need to
35

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

understand the information and communication technologies needed for management and
the role of knowledge in the operations of organizations (Laihonen et al., 2013).
Indisputably, the technology plays a prominent role in knowledge sharing and in
knowledge management processes, and when selecting the technology solutions, the
organizations must consider their business strategies and the characteristics of
organizations such as numbers of employees, level of geographic dispersal and the nature
of the environment that organizations operate in (Hislop, 2013; Pirkkalainen et al., 2017).

3.2 Individual Factors
In addition to critical organizational factors related to the success of knowledge-sharing
practices, such as culture, leadership and technology, according to many researches, all
types of knowledge sharing ultimately originate from the individual interactions and
behavior in organizations (Sergeeva & Andreeva, 2016; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; WidénWuff, 2007). More specifically, the factors that influence an individual’s willingness to
share knowledge are fundamental, and can be divided into, for example, an individual’s
motivational, trustworthiness and behavioral factors, as well as their barriers and enablers
(Ardichvili, 2008).
According to Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar (2016), factors related to the individual information
sharer include dispositional characteristics, demographic characteristics such as age and
gender, attitudes, knowledge sharing, and general work and organizational attitudes. In
addition, previous research has identified factors that effect on knowledge sharing
behavior (Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar, 2016), which are such as:
•

Enablers,

•

Facilitators,

•

Motivators,

•

Inhibitors,

•

Barriers, as well as

•

Deterrents

In this study, enablers, facilitators, and motivators are used as synonyms, which allow
and enable the sharing of knowledge, and inhibitors, barriers, and deterrents are used as
synonyms that impedes the flow of knowledge.

Understanding factors that typically drive knowledge sharing in today’s business
operations among employees is a prerequisite for enabling employees to interact and
achieve the ideal level of communication and knowledge sharing (Kumaraswamy &
Chitale, 2012). Somewhat simplistically, knowledge sharing drivers may positively or
negatively affect knowledge sharing and, thus, a careful evaluation of the drivers are
important prerequisites for knowledge sharing practices development in organizations
(Barachini, 2009; Ghobadi, 2015). No system will work without the added knowledge,
and information cannot be re-used unless it is known how it will be exploited (Kuettner
et al., 2013; Razmerita et al., 2016). Therefore, it is important to understand what factors
influence employees’ willingness to share and use knowledge (Okkonen et al., 2018).
Next, the factors that typically influence individual’s knowledge sharing are discussed in
more detail.

3.2.1 Motivation, Attitude and Behavior
Motivation has been studied in the literature through many different perspectives and is
a very context-sensitive concept (Ghobadi, 2015). For example, an individual’s work
motivation has been studied from several perspectives for decades, but quite rarely, only
for a few years, attention has been paid to an individual’s motivation to share knowledge
within the organization (Barachini, 2009; Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). According to
Huang, Chiu & Lu (2013) several empirical studies report that the presence of motivations
had negative or insigniﬁcant impacts on knowledge sharing intentions, attitudes, or
behaviors. Hence, an individual’s motivation can be looked as one of the key enablers of
knowledge sharing (Okkonen et al., 2018).

Definitions of Motivation, Attitude and Behavior
Figure 5. Willingness, Skills and Opportunities as a Basis of Motivation. Developed from
Silvennoinen and Kauppinen (2006, p. 27).

Motivation can be defined as the changing mental state of an individual in relation to a
particular situation, which determines the alertness and direction how he or she behaviors
(Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Motivation can mean a system of different factors that

37

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

guides behavior and defines how a person strives to achieve their goals (Okkonen et al.,
2018). Hence, as illustrated in the Figure 5, an individual’s own will, skills and
opportunities to show one’s own motivation defines motivation (Silvennoinen &
Kauppinen, 2006). Furthermore, motivation is related to a person’s mental state, which
determines the activity with which a person acts and how his or her interest is perceived
(Peltonen & Ruohotie 1987; Okkonen et al., 2018). Therefore, motivation is a dynamic
and complex process that unites a human being’s personality, rational and emotional
factors, and the social environment (Lin, 2007).
The word motivation comes from the Latin word ‘movere’, which means mobilizing and
movement (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987; Aaltonen, Pajunen, Tuominen, 2011). Moreover,
the origin of the Latin word movere is ‘motus’, which means movement, exercise, gesture,
movement, even rebellion and riot (Aaltonen et al., 2011). According to Peltonen and
Ruohotie (1987), motive is the basis of motivation as it is a motivator that creates and
maintains a person’s motivation. Motive can be conscious or unconscious and either
internal, biological or social (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Depending of the context,
among other things, the words motive and individual’s preparedness, needs, and
expectations describe and are related to motivation. (Barachini, 2009; Gagne, 2009).
Attitude and motivation are sometimes linked together but mean different things
(Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987; Huang et al., 2013). For the sake of clarity, the differences
are briefly reviewed. On top of that what defined of motivation previously, according to
Peltonen and Ruohotie (1987), motivation can be described as the weather and attitude
can be compared to climate. This means that the target area of motivation is narrow, its
time span is short, and it changes easily. Correspondingly, climate is attitudes, and can be
seen an extensive region with a long-time span and difficult to change (Peltonen &
Ruohotie, 1987). Most importantly, nurturing motivation stresses situational actions, such
as incentives, measurements, and feedback, while attitude require long-term changes and
are, thus, quite persistent and challenging to change (Barachini, 2009; Martela & Jarenko,
2015).
An individual’s behavior is much researched topic. According to Widén (2017), an
important starting point for understanding what affects the individual in the context of
information activities is the behavior of individuals. Knowledge can be gathered from

38

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

everywhere and through listening actively, and observing people’s behavior, we can
identify and interpret the real messages that they mean (Widén, 2017). Thus, by
understanding human behavior, we can acquire much more valuable knowledge that we
could only literally produce (Dela, 2004; Wang & Hou, 2015). According to Dela (2004),
our very basic physical senses effect on our behavior and must be considered when
sharing knowledge. The five physical senses are:
•

Sight,

•

Smell,

•

Hearing,

•

Taste, and

•

Touch

As argued previously, motivation effects the individual’s desire and behavior to share
knowledge with each other. Motivated behavior is voluntary, dependent and controlled
activity of the individual (Okkonen et al, 2018). However, an individual knowledge
behavior and its performance is relatively neglected area in the knowledge management
research, and it is often linked to an individual’s attitude to share knowledge (Henttonen
et al., 2016). Further, the exact definitions of the concepts of motivation, attitude and
behavior is challenging, because the entity encompasses the characteristics of both the
individual and the situation, as well as the interpretation of the individual (Martela &
Jarenko, 2015).

Work Motivation and Job Satisfaction
In many cases, an individual’s work motivation is closely related to the same as
motivation to share knowledge, because a work-motivated employee is likely to be more
open to share knowledge (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987; Kurttila et al., 2010; Martela &
Jarenko, 2015). Work motivation arises from the employee's personality, job
characteristics as well as the combined effect of the work environment and work situation
(Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Previous studies show that work performance improves as
work motivation increases, and the performance level affected by individual differences
in personality (Martela & Jarenko, 2015). Motivation is associated essentially with
sharing knowledge, as it is directly related to an individual’s behavior, and how they
perceive the importance of knowledge and its sharing. Moreover, for instance, the time
an individual has to spend collecting relevant knowledge has a long-term effect on

39

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

whether it reduces or increases the motivation of employees to work (Lahtinen et al.,
2013).
Moreover, job satisfaction is a related concept to work motivation. Often these two are
studied and dealt with together, but they are viewed differently by researchers. However,
job satisfaction stems from rewarding performance, while work motivation depends, for
example, on reward expectations (Peltonen & Ruohotie 1987). Martela and Jarenko
(2015) state that measuring job satisfaction is outdated, and the focus should be on
measuring employee work motivation and enthusiasm. In their view, this is because
employee motivation and enthusiasm better predict organizational performance than job
satisfaction (Martela & Jarenko, 2015).

Motivation Types and Methods
Typically, motivation is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the terms are
commonly used in previous knowledge-sharing studies as drivers or determinants of
knowledge sharing behavior (Tyler, 2012; Vuori & Okkonen, 2012). Intrinsic motivation
refers to a motivation in which the task itself is interesting for the person or is pleasant
for her or him to do (Wang & Hou, 2015). According to many researchers (e.g. Lin, 2007;
Osterloh & Frey, 2000; Razmerita et al., 2016), intrinsically motivated employees are
likely to be highly committed to the task and strive to improve their own skills. On the
other hand, intrinsic motivation increases their own capabilities as well as the productivity
of organizations, which is beneficial and desirable for all parties (Lin, 2007; Osterloh &
Frey, 2000; Razmerita et al., 2016).
According to both Razmerita et al. (2016) and Vuori and Okkonen (2012), the difference
with intrinsic motivation is that extrinsic motivation is usually described as an attempt or
a drive to do something for fear of external punishment. Thus, it can be said that extrinsic
motivation focuses on activities that lead to the desirable outcome. In addition, the
perception of effort and reward is typically related to extrinsic motivation in sharing
knowledge. This idea can be seen as a result and a basis for reward systems that many
organizations have put in place to motivate employees to share knowledge (Razmerita et
al., 2016; Vuori & Okkonen, 2012).

40

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Numerous studies show that the intrinsic motivational elements facilitate knowledge
sharing more effectively than the extrinsic factors (Vuori & Okkonen, 2012). However,
identifying and supporting the internal motivation of employees to share knowledge can
seem cumbersome, which is why it is most often thought that it is easier to guide
employees by means of extrinsic motivation (Wang & Hou, 2015). In any occasion, using
only extrinsic motivation in today’s organization is inevitably outdated, and ultimately a
laborious option, and as numerous studies on the subject show, it is not effective at all
(Martela & Jarenko, 2015). In order for employees to have an incentive to share their
knowledge, however, the expected benefits must, of course, reimburse the costs and effort
(Razmerita et al., 2016).
It is clear that motivation for sharing knowledge can diverse and knowledge sharing
activities cannot be forced (Henttonen et al., 2016). According to Tyler (2012), employees
are motivated to share knowledge for two reasons, which are:
1) Firstly, because people want rewards and avoid being punished, and
2) Secondly, because employees own intrinsic motivations, such as values and
attitudes influence, and they simply want to share their knowledge.
Therefore, the sense of personal importance in knowledge sharing is more powerful than
enjoyment, or material and social rewards (Tyler, 2012).
Furthermore, studies have found that, for example, tacit knowledge involves more effort
to share and thus may require more and, or at least different incentives to share than
explicit knowledge requires (Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016). Sharing tacit knowledge
might be less dependent on external incentives and is mainly driven by individuals’
autonomous motivation (Hau et al., 2013; Osterloh & Frey, 2000). In addition to this, the
sharing of tacit knowledge might be more dependent on individual skills to share
knowledge (Hau et al., 2013; Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016), which is being discussed in
more detail later in the section 3.2.2.
However, management can promote an individual’s motivation to share knowledge.
Based on the literature, themes that support an individual’s motivation in organization to
share knowledge are:
•

Personnel decisions,

•

Job planning,
41

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

•

Performance appraisal and remuneration systems,

•

Management practices and communication of practices,

•

Leadership,

•

Trust,

•

Change management, and

•

Education and development (Gagné 2009; Laitinen & Stenvall 2012; Rytilä
2011).

Gagné (2009), suggests how human resource management (HRM) can promote
individuals’ intrinsic motivation to share knowledge. In short, her theory is based on a
combination of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and self-determination theory
(SDT) (Gagné, 2009). The model proposes that when using both TPB and SDT, an
individual’s intentions to share knowledge and actual sharing behavior in organizations
can be predicted. Moreover, theory of self-determination takes into account the quality of
motivation that enhances knowledge-sharing behavior (Gagné, 2009). The model of
knowledge sharing motivation is shown in the Figure 6.
Figure 6. The Model of Knowledge-sharing Motivation. Developed from Gagné (2009, p. 575).

Martela and Jarenko (2015) state that a motivated employee is more productive than a
non-motivated one because motivated people spend more energy on their tasks, they see
their tasks more broadly, learn faster, are more creative, work harder, are better customer
servants, change jobs less frequently, and rarely take sick leave. Additionally, the
individual’s motivation is related to person’s own self-image, which affect self-

42

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

confidence and, thus, well-being at work (Martela & Jarenko, 2015). In addition, the
motivation and value experienced by the employee increases when he or she receives
appreciation (Kurttila et al., 2010).

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
According to Barachini (2009) and Sydänmaanlakka (2017), Abraham Maslow’s (1943
& 1954) five-step hierarchy of needs is the best known, most used, and much criticized
theory of human needs. Maslow’s theory of needs has also been linked to describe an
individual’s motivation to share knowledge. The theory is based on the fact that needs
and motives of an individual are organized hierarchically and therefore the needs lower
in the hierarchy must meet in some way before an individual can be motivated by a higherlevel motive in the hierarchy. In addition, according to Maslow's theory, work must be
organized to meet the hierarchies of needs and incentives that meet those needs
(Barachini, 2009; Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is broad, but in
this study, the focus is only on the individual factors that influence knowledge sharing.
Typically, Marslow’s hierarchy of needs is described in a shape of pyramid and is
illustrated in the Figure 7.
Figure 7. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Developed from Sydänmaanlakka (2017, p. 214).

43

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Briefly, the five different stages of human needs are in a hierarchic order, starting from
the bottom of the pyramid, the most basic ones to the top of the pyramid, to the most
complex ones. However, the goal of Maslow’s theory is to attain the highest level of stage
self-actualization needs. As seen in the Figure 7, Maslow has identified five steps of needs
that human motivations generally move through, which are:
•

Physiological needs,

•

Safety needs,

•

Love and belonging needs,

•

Self-esteem needs, and

•

Self-actualization needs (Barachini, 2009; Sydänmaanlakka, 2017).

According to Sydänmaanlakka (2017), in essence, individuals can have any need for
knowledge sharing regardless of others. In order to describe the different perspectives of
an individual’s needs, for instance, for some work means livelihoods and, for others work
is related to seeking social contacts. However, individual motivation factors for
knowledge sharing are emphasized at the top of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and the
problem areas are situated to the lower end of the hierarchy. For example, the external
motivational factors relate to the lowest level of physiological needs and are mainly
related to livelihood as motivating factors in the workplace, such as pay, vacations, and
other benefits. An individual’s motivation towards knowledge sharing consists of several
things. For example, a sense of community motivates knowledge sharing and social
relationships and a common language create an environment conducive to share
knowledge (Sydänmaalakka, 2017).

Alderfer’s ERG Theory
For the purposes of this study, however, Aldefer’s (1972) transformation of Maslow’s
five need’s theory to reduction of three needs is more appropriate in assessing an
individual’s motivation to share knowledge (Barachini, 2009). According to Barachini
(2009), Aldefer stated that the needs in the Malsow’s pyramid are overlapping and calls
his own three-class pyramid of needs as a ERG theory. The three classes are as follows:
•

Growth needs,

•

Relatedness needs,

•

Existence needs.

44

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

In addition to the difference between three classes instead of five, the main difference in
the ERG theory to Maslow’s theory is that not all the needs of one class need to be met
before the needs of the next class can be reached (Barachini, 2009). This reduction from
Maslow’s theory to Aldefer’s ERG theory is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Reduction from Maslow to Aldefer, the Three Needs of an Individual. Developed from
Barachini (2009, p. 106).

In summary, the factors that motivates an individual to share her or his knowledge is a
complex and sum of many interdependent and independent aspects. Sometimes, however,
mere motivation to share knowledge is not enough and knowledge is needed on how or
with whom it is shared (Henttonen et al., 2016). This requires the individual both to have
the skills and personal behavior to share knowledge, which are addressed next.

3.2.2 Personal Skills, Competence, Learning, Training, and Technostress
Thus far, the individual’s skills for knowledge sharing have not been extensively studied
in KM studies even if learning and skills is a very broad and much researched area. Today,
however, it is understood that in this transformation of the knowledge environment, the
notion of knowledge-basedness, in particular, needs to be expanded (Henttonen et al.,
2016). In this context, emphasis is placed on the individual’s personal learning and skills
in both acquiring and sharing knowledge.

Definitions of Skills and Competence
An individual’s skills and competence are based on knowledge and is channelled into
action when the skill holder applies knowledge in a motivated manner (Virtainlahti,

45

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

2009). An individual’s competence consists of knowledge, skills, attitudes, experiences
and contacts, where the learner is the processor, editor, and holder of knowledge
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). In addition, competence and skills are equated with a person's
professional skills and expertise (Virtainlahti, 2009).
According to Hellström et al. (2019) knowledge use and sharing require new types of
interaction skills from both process designers and those involved. Knowledge sharing
stands for the mutual exchange of knowledge, which ideally leads to relevant knowledge
sharing between individuals. For this to happen, individuals must both engage in
knowledge sharing and it requires new skills of individuals (Hellström et al, 2019).
Therefore, the success of knowledge sharing essentially boils down to an individual’s
skills (Henttonen et al., 2016). Because learning enables a person’s knowledge and skills,
it is defined next.

Definition of Learning
Learning is the process by which an individual acquires knowledge, skills, attitudes,
experiences and contacts that lead to changes in his or her actions (Serrat, 2009;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). According to Sydänmaanlakka (2012), typically, learning
defined through different stairs or levels, and learning can take place on many levels.
Before the level of knowing, two levels can already be distinguished, which are that either
the person thinks she or he knows or she or he knows that she or he does not know
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Therefore, learning is about knowing, understanding,
application and development (Ardichvili, 2008; Blacker, 1995; Lahtinen et al., 2013). The
stairs of learning are illustrated in the Figure 9.
Figure 9. The Stairs of Learning. Developed from Sydänmaanlakka (2012, p. 34).

46

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Learning new skills is not such a straightforward process, but learning is of a different
type. For instance, Sydänmaanlakka (2012) defines four different kinds of types of
learning, which are:
•

Responsive learning,

•

Proactive learning,

•

Action learning, and

•

Questioning learning.

Different types of learning can also occur together (Sydänmaanlakka, 2014). In particular,
learning through knowledge sharing is equated with action learning in the work
community (Järvinen, Koivisto & Poikela, 2000). In any case, learning takes place if a
person has a desire to learn, so previously described motivation is the starting point for
all learning and, thus, for and individual’s personal skills (Ardichvili, 2008; Serrat, 2009;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).

Forms of Skills and Competence
Knowledge is shared in many of ways, including through interaction, collaboration,
training and dissemination of methods and practises that have been successful elsewhere
(Seergeva & Andreeva, 2016). A trained expert must be cooperative and possess
interaction skills in addition to independent problem-solving ability (Amayah, 2012;
Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar, 2016). In knowledge work, managing and constantly updating
one’s own knowledge is the key factors. In addition, today’s network-like work and
activities require the utilization of competence development methods and the sharing of
knowledge (Sydänmaanlakka, 2017).
An effective person has a set of skills with which she or he creates added value for her or
his organization (Janus, 2016, Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006). Silvennoinen and
Kauppinen (2006) suggest that these individual’s skills can be grouped, for example, as
follows:
•

Work-related skills,
which involve technical and practical skills. These form the basis of a set of skills
related to the use of work environment tools, as well as the general knowledge
and skills required at work. They require training, practice and experience. An

47

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

effective employee manages his or her job so well that his or her skills in critical
work stages are extremely important.
•

Interpersonal skills related to the organization,
including skills related to how the employee acts as a member of the team and
how she or he is able to build a network with people and supervisors across the
organization. At its best, an employee has a well-functioning network that helps
them get their job done and help in difficult situations. In addition, by interacting
with different people, he also learns himself all the time.

•

The values are in place,
which refers to an employee with a ‘bold conscience’, who guides her or his
actions at work and in interactions. This can be, for example, pleasantness, an
understanding of reciprocity, and a sincere appreciation of another person’s
expertise. According to research, when people get to choose with whom they
prefer to work with, they choose their partner on two main criteria, one is the
person’s qualifications and the other is her or his pleasantness (Silvennoinen &
Kauppinen, 2006).

It is said that practical knowledge and reasoning involve knowledge as well as the tacit
knowledge already defined in section 2.1.3 earlier. Thus, competence can be presented as
a chain of combining and using information, starting with the utilization of information,
which leads to knowledge and know-how (Sydänmaanlakka, 2014), of which leads to an
individual’s skills to use and share knowledge (Janus, 2016). This chain of learning,
where knowledge is applied and, eventually, can be considered as an individual’s skills,
is illustrated in the Figure 10.
Figure 10. The Chain of Learning, Applying Knowledge to Skills. Developed from Sydänmaalakka
(2014, p. 72) and Janus (2016, p. 32).

48

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

For an expert in continuous professionalism competence maintenance and development,
special skills and training are important practices. According to Janus (2016) for
employees’ knowledge sharing to thrive, organizations need to develop two things,
1) Firstly, the capability enabling environment, and
2) Secondly, the technical skills.
The enabling environment for capabilities is created mainly by management of the
organization, of which make strategic decisions. These were discussed in more detail in
the previous sections 2.3. and 3.1. However, in particular, the technical skills
operationalize effective knowledge capturing and sharing. Both capabilities can be
divided into four pillars (see Figure 11 below), which are supporting an individual’s skills
to better knowledge sharing. Enabling environment includes leadership and
organizational culture that conductive knowledge sharing, by everyday operations, which
again for their part ensure attractive recognition mechanisms that reward employees for
sharing knowledge. They include effective governance mechanisms and the enabling
environment is supported through financing and partnerships. Technical capabilities for
effective knowledge operations consist of systematically identifying and capturing the
organization’s operational experiences and lessons, packaging them into knowledge and
learning products, sharing them within and outside the organization, and monitoring and
evaluating these efforts (Janus, 2016).

Janus (2016, p. 8).

Importance of Training
The development of skills related to the use of knowledge often emphasizes the skills
needed to communicate and make knowledge understandable and to improve the
matching of knowledge supply and demand (Hellström et al., 2019). One of the
bottlenecks in knowledge sharing and use is, in particular, due to the lack of an
individual’s expertise and skills (Janus, 2016; Skulanski, 1996; Wang & Hou, 2015).
Hellström et al. (2019) investigated the factors that affect the decision making in society
and determined eight factors that are related to an individual’s personal skills to deal with
and share knowledge, which are:

50

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

1. Creating a snapshot,
2. Facing uncertainty,
3. Monitoring and evaluation,
4. Building networks,
5. Stakeholder involvement,
6. Understanding different worlds,
7. Communication and advice, and
8. Interpersonal skills.
The importance of training plays a great role in effectiveness of an individuals, which is
highly appreciated skill in an employee (Janus, 2016; Zieba et al., 2016). According to
Janus, (2016) some of the more commonly required skills of an employee are:
•

Interpersonal communication

•

Information technology

•

Learning design and facilitation

•

Journalism skills

•

Information management

•

Writing skills

•

Analytical skills

•

Management skills

However, as stated by Janus (2016, 32) “knowledge-sharing initiatives will not gain a
foothold in an organization’s daily operations unless staff members are trained in how to
participate in and benefit from knowledge sharing”. In addition, it is also important that
training programs relate to specific tasks and activities already performed by employees,
and not duplication or unnecessary training (Gagné, 2009; Zieba et al., 2016). Janus
(2016) suggests that integrating knowledge exchange training into the orientation
activities of new employees can also be an effective way to embed ways of knowledge
sharing in organizational culture and in the subsequent way individuals act.
Correspondingly, Gagné (2009) states that the mere possibility of training access affects
individual behavior and task performance positively, as it influences an individual’s
intrinsic motivation.

51

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

In addition, organizations benefit in many ways when the competitiveness of those who
operate there is ensured (Virtainlahti, 2009). For example, organizing a substitute staff
scheme can increase personal room for maneuver and know-how of different work tasks
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2014; Virtainlahti, 2009). Organizational competence is created when
tacit knowledge is transformed into visible information and again back for tacit
information (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). Recently, the vigorously increased use of
technology and new digital and virtual worlds in the work environment has significantly
increased the need of an employee to learn new ways of doing work (Pirkkalainen et al.,
2017). The earlier studies on knowledge sharing and socializing in virtual worlds have
suggested that these environments have several specific advantages and limitations that
are not found in other types of digital environments. According to Huvila et al. (2014);
for example, the multimodality of communication and possibility to interact with a threedimensional environment has been suggested to enhance social exchange and
consequently, processes of knowledge use and learning. The accumulation of social
capital is, however, a complex process (Huvila et al., 2014).

Concept of Technostress
As the active use of information technology (IT) is significantly increased in
organizations, a one new negative effect of IT, a phenomenon called technostress, has
emerged among people (Tarafdar et al., 2015). In essence, technostress “has been defined
as the inability of an individual to cope with the demands of IT use, which results in
perceived stress” (Pirkkalainen et al., 2017, p.1). Resent research in the field has shown
that both enablers and restraints of handling the stress and coping with the heavy
workload are strongly related to the well-being at work, and should be addressed in order
to facilitate better work performance (Okkonen et al., 2018; Tarafdar et al., 2015).
In addition, Pirkkalainen et al. (2017) argue that technostress is caused by constant
connectivity and ‘always on’ mentality, which negatively affects an individual’s personal
achievements and overall performance and, thus, causing negative emotions. However,
an individual’s emotions influence directly to knowledge sharing intentions, such as to an
individual’s willingness and motivation to share knowledge (Dela, 2004; Van den Hooff,
Schouten & Simonovski, 2012). Technostress is also increased and associated with the
fact, when ICT tools are difficult to use, or the training or management is poorly organized
(Okkonen et al., 2018). Moreover, the phenomenon of technostress not only sets major
52

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

demands for managing and training but requires a wide understanding of IT users’ daily
practices and their varying demands set by IT (Pirkkalainen et al., 2017).

Emotional Intelligence and Self-leadership
However, the responsibility for promoting healthy IT use does not lie solely with the
organization and management, as IT users themselves play a key role in controlling their
IT use (Pirkkalainen et al., 2017). Correspondingly, Sydänmaanlakka (2017) argue that
today’s busy person is ultimately responsible for their own mind control and an
individual’s mental intelligence is a crucial factor in coping with any kind of stress.
Psychic intelligence can be defined as the skillful management of one’s rational mind,
where the goal is peace of mind. Thus, stress and mind can be controlled by
contemplation, such as reflecting on one’s skills. For instance, an individual may embark
on her or his own mental intelligence by following skills and abilities (Sydänmaanlakka,
2017):
•

Considering good learning skills, such as the ability to acquire, absorb, and use
knowledge effectively,

•

Problem-solving ability, and

•

Self-reflection, that is, in-depth assessment of things.

In other words, so-called sub-skills such as how to be a good subordinate and employee
are emphasized in today’s working life, where the amount of knowledge has increased
(Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006). Silvennoinen and Kauppinen (2006) continues that
emotional intelligence controls how a person is able to use their other skills, abilities, and
personality as fully as possible. Emotional intelligence includes skills that make it easier
for us to get along with ourselves or other people. Coping with oneself is, thus, related to
the ability to identify, make observations and understand one’s own feelings as well as
emotion-based behavior. This has also been found to have a clear effect on emotion-based
fear and conflict situations, where feelings of insecurity or trust are emphasized
(Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006).
Self-leadership has a central spot in the knowing, learning, and sharing one's know-how
and knowledge. According to Stewart, Courtright & Manz (2011, p. 11) “Self-leadership
is generally beneficial at the individual level but context dependent at the team level.
Having individuals regulate their own actions is consistently helpful both to them
53

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

personally and to the organization.” Moreover, self-leading employees have more
positive effect at work (Stewart et al., 2011). Self-leadership is related to another concept,
to self-actualization, which is having self-respect and self-acceptance, to a positive
attitude about oneself, and to accepting one’s positive and negative qualities
(Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006). However, this study does not focus on neither of
these concepts in more detail.
In conclusion, individual skills and learning are a very broad concept and, therefore, this
study only provides a better understanding of demanded individual skills and
competencies required in terms of knowledge sharing. Since knowledge sharing and all
forms of communication in general take place in between different individuals or
communities, previous research has shown that trust between individuals is one of the
most required things to exist in order for knowledge to be shared (Hislop, 2013; Niven,
Hollman & Totterdell, 2012). Hence, the next section introduces the topic.

3.2.3 Trust
Trust is said to be a prerequisite for knowledge sharing (Widén-Wuff, 2007). High levels
of trust provide positive experiences, which, in turn, encourage knowledge sharing among
individuals (Arnold, Benford, Hampton & Sutton, 2014). Similarly, Chen, Lin & Yen
(2014) agree that trust is an important predictor of knowledge sharing. Further, when the
relationship is built on trust, a more open and effective knowledge sharing relationship
plays an important role in other organizational levels, too (Chen et al., 2014). For instance,
trust plays an important role in managing change and other reforms in the organization
(Niven et al., 2012).

Concept of Trust
Figure 12. Trust is Credibility and Empathy. Developed from Silvennoinen and Kauppinen (2006, p.
67).

Trust is built by credibility and empathy together (Figure 12) and, in addition, trust
includes a dimension of benevolence and honesty (Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006).

54

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Moreover, trust can be discussed at both individual level as an interpersonal trust and at
organisational or different social levels (Hau et al., 2013).
According to Silvennoinen and Kauppinen (2006), a problem-solving sales negotiation
emphasizes building trust and credibility, and this mindset is equally well suited to
building trust between people. The elements related to credibility and trust are as follows
(Silvennoinen & Kauppinen, 2006):
•

Good manners,
which means the willingness and ability to respond to external expectations of the
other party appropriate conduct and behavior. This can be a suitable way of
speaking, for example.

•

Competence,
which is the other party's perception that you have expertise. Competence
essentially involves the ability to cooperate.

•

Cohesion,
which is the perception of how similar your interests, beliefs and values are.
Respect for the values of the other is an integral part of this.

•

Intentions,
which means an interest in the success and well-being of another. Intentions are
related to a person’s motives.

Moreover, one key factor that has been identified as an important factor preventing the
sharing of knowledge is fear (Razmerita et al. 2016). So called psychological safety is
positively related to more interpersonal communication (Law, Chan, Ozer, 2019).
Influencing people’s emotions may be a successful way to gain people’s trust and tackle
fear. When employees do not know what is happening or is about to happen, it causes
fear and doubt about the future (Niven et. al., 2012). According to Sydänmaanlakka
(2012) the organization must have enough so-called trust capital. This means that
everyone trusts that the sharing of knowledge contributes to their own and the
organization’s success. In this context, it is important that the knowledge shared is
relevant. Typically, in the definition of relevant knowledge, a shared concrete vision and
a strategy for the company are useful (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Similarly, Hislop (2013)
states that collaboration and knowledge sharing can be facilitated by efforts to develop

55

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

the social relationship that exists between those involved in cross-community
collaborating. The importance of trust is huge in this context (Hislop, 2013).
Trust can be classiﬁed to different dimension types, and according to Hsu, Ju, Yen, and
Chang (2007), who discuss trust in virtual communities, the dimensions of trust are as
follows:
•

Economy-based trust,

•

Information-based trust, and

•

Identiﬁcation-based trust.

Economy-based trust, which can be for example, joining a virtual community, saves time
and cost in obtaining knowledge and will also improve individual’s own skills.
Information-based trust refers to security of personal information and trust that it will not
be misused. Identiﬁcation-based trust means the opportunity to freely discuss personal
issues without a fear of receiving anything other than a constructive response (Hsu et al.,
2007).
Law et al. (2019) suggests that when the workplace represents the presence of trust,
employees trust their co-workers and managers and perceive fairness in how their effort
has been awarded. Empirical evidences have shown that hence, they feel psychologically
safe to continue contributing themselves to the continuous improvement of the
organization (Law et al., 2019). As a tool, storytelling helps building trust between the
partners, since it sometimes reveals personal viewpoints as well (Rauhala & Vikström,
2014).

Share-hoard Dilemma
Razmerita et al. (2016, p. 1240) investigated which factors affect employees’ knowledge
sharing behavior within organizations and found out that “the biggest identified challenge
is to change of behavior from hoarding to sharing knowledge”. According to their
research, individuals pursue to maximize their own interests and salary, which makes
them reluctant to participate in knowledge sharing and, thus, leading to collective damage
(Razmerita et al., 2016). Correspondingly, Henttonen et al. (2016) argue that if an
individual experience a benefit, it increases the likelihood of knowledge-sharing
behavior, while perceived costs have a negative impact on commitment to knowledge

56

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

sharing. Moreover, expected benefits or rewards may be monetary or non-monetary
nature. In addition, a possible loss of value and bargaining power and, thus, the protection
of one’s personal advantages at work is related as a one reason for the reluctance of a
knowledge provider to share knowledge. However, based on the results of the area, it has
been found that for employees with a higher level of education, knowledge sharing is
perceived to be positive and constitutes power at work, since knowledge sharing leads to
a better work performance (Henttonen et al., 2016).
Management policies and organizational structures are also essential to be flexible,
supporting and optimizing individual knowledge sharing, and, thus, contributing to
enable knowledge hoarding in places, divisions, departments, and functions (Iqbal,
Toulson & Tweed, 2014; Kamla & Olfman, 2016). Correspondently, feeling of justice is
other important facilitator of knowledge sharing in the workplace (Law et al., 2019). The
work environment prevents the sharing of knowledge and encourages the hoarding of
knowledge, if the incentives are not fair nor merged with targets set by management
(Kamla & Olfman, 2016). Employees, who share knowledge, should be recognized, but
with the right metrics, since poor organizational policies regarding employee recognition
may adversely affect their knowledge sharing behavior (Iqbal et al., 2014). For instance,
according to Osterloh and Frey (2000), employees’ potential abilities and knowledge
cannot be measured if employee performance is determined solely by outcomes. Hence,
organizational policies that create a competitive environment between employees are
likely to undermine collaboration and lead to knowledge hoarding (Osterloh & Frey,
2000). However, understanding this requires further research, and this study does not
address the share-hoard dilemma in any more detail.
In summary, knowledge sharing among employees depends on participation and
communication, and requires voluntary, dynamic interactions based on intersubjectivity
and trust among the organization’s members (Ahn & Hong, 2019). However, these
actions can be significantly maintained and improved in organizations (Kamla & Olfman,
2016). Boland and Tenkasi (1995) argue that effective knowledge sharing involves a
process of mutual perspective taking where distinctive individual knowledge is
exchanged, evaluated and integrated with that of others in the organization. Today,
increasingly common decentralized groups and virtual groups significantly increase
management difficulties and, as well, opportunities (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
57

Commitment is the spark that separates good teams from the excellent teams and, thus,
the management should likely to spend much of their effort on strengthening and enabling
individual’s

behavior,

and

among

others

(Sydänmaanlakka, 2014; Henttonen et al., 2016).

4 METHODOLOGY
This chapter reviews the qualitative case study research approach and the inductive
content analysis used in the thesis as methods to gather and examine the data. The data
collection was carried out in a typical way for a case study using several different
methods, and the selected methods are presented in this chapter. The core data was
collected through interviews with the operational employees in one of the sub-units of the
case company, and the additional knowledge on the topic under study was gathered
through observations, interviews with selected managers and reviews of the case
company’s publications and websites. Moreover, a detailed description of how the
interviews were conducted, the preparations for the interviews, the themes of the semistructured interviews-questions, and the background of the interviewees, are introduced.
In addition, the case company is introduced briefly and the current and desired state of
the internal knowledge sharing practices and the background of the interviewees are
clarified.
Successful data collection requires careful and holistic planning in advance. To ensure
reliable findings from the research, it is important to select a suitable method for the data
collection process that meets the requirements of the study and supports to fulfil the
objective of the thesis (Liamputton, 2013). This thesis lays a great emphasis on the
collected data. The objective of this thesis, as presented in the section 1.3., is to map the
employee’s perspective of the internal knowledge sharing practices of the organization
and, thus, identify how the existing practices can be developed. Therefore, the overall
objective of this thesis is to provide a rich description of how internal knowledge sharing
practices and their management can be supported by SME’s. Next, the chosen methods
and approaches for data collection are presented.

4.1 Qualitative Case Study Research
The aim of a qualitative research is to describe the phenomenon under study in the context
of real life and, thus, identify the meanings of the research and the related functions.
According to Hirsjärvi, Remes, & Sajavaara (2005), reality is seen as diverse,
interconnected as a whole of influential events that cannot be broken down into parts
arbitrarily. Typically, information and knowledge in qualitative research are acquired in
59

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

real situations, where the target group or respondents are appropriately selected.
Therefore, a qualitative research is understood to be a unique description of the current
situation (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005). Furthermore, the qualitative research method seeks to
understand social reality and provides a rich description of people and interaction in the
natural setting and, thus, provides an in-depth understanding of the topic (Liamputton,
2013). One of the benefits of a qualitative research is that the implementation of the
research is flexible, which means that the research plan is modifiable and may change as
the research progresses, if necessary (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005).
However, in order to describe the nature of a particular phenomenon in qualitative
research, the challenge is to succeed in obtaining generalizable knowledge of the subject
under study (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005). As a case study seeks to apply practical and useful indepth knowledge (Valli, 2018), the case study approach was used to support and provide
a broad understanding of the reality in order to develop practices (Liamputton, 2013;
Valli, 2018). The case study collects detailed information about the work community and
its processes (Metsämuuronen, 2000). In addition, a case study is often seen as a
preliminary or a pilot study of the main research as it answers how and why questions
(Liamputton, 2013). The data can be collected and analyzed partially simultaneously, and
qualitative research can also include quantitative information (Metsämuuronen, 2000).
Furthermore, since the case study is intended to provide a deep and diverse picture of the
phenomenon under study, the case study is characterized by a multi-methodological
approach (Kananen, 2019; Metsämuuronen, 2000).

4.1.1 Inductive Content Analysis
According to Tuomi and Sarajärvi (2012), content analysis can be divided into three
different analysis models, which are:
•

Data-driven (inductive),

•

Theory-bound (deductive), and

•

Theory-based analysis model.

Due the nature of the practice-based objective of the research, an inductive content
analysis was chosen for this study. In general, an inductive content analysis is a
commonly used method in qualitative research and, in particular, to describe the

60

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

phenomenon under study. In addition, content analysis captures the phenomenon in a
concise manner, which helps to organize the material for drawing conclusions (Tuomi &
Sarajärvi, 2012). By the same token, an inductive content analysis seeks to reveal
unexpected facts by looking at the data material in detail and in a complex way
(Liamputton, 2013). Therefore, by using an inductive content analysis when analysing a
qualitative data, the researcher does not decide what is important and what not, which
sometimes is found to be problematic (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005).
According to Tuomi and Sarajärvi (2012), an inductive content analysis of the qualitative
data can be described as a three-step-process, which includes reduction of the data (1),
aggregating of clustering the data (2), and creation of theoretical concepts (3). These
three steps are illustrated in the Figure 13.
Figure 13. Inductive, a Data-driven Content Analysis as a Three-Step-Process. Developed from
Tuomi & Sarajärvi (2012, p. 108).

In the first phase of the three-step-process of an inductive content analysis, the reduction
of the data refers to the compaction of fragmentation of the collected data. Once this step
is done, the original expressions coded from the data material are carefully reviewed when
aggregating or grouping the data. At the same time similarities or differences are
evaluated, and the concepts that mean the same thing are grouped and, typically, named
into a class. The classification may be, for example, a property, feature, or perception of
the phenomenon under study. This second step helps in creating the basis structure of the
study and preliminary descriptions may be done of the subject phenomenon. After
clustering, an abstraction is performed that separates from the research point of view
relevant concepts and theoretical concepts are formed on the basis of selected
information. Thus, abstraction is continued by combining classifications as long as it is
necessary or possible from the point of view of the content of the material (Tuomi &
Sarajärvi, 2012).

4.1.2 SWOT Analysis
A SWOT analysis is a very useful technique for evaluating various issues, especially for
preliminary mapping of certain topics and organizational environments (Ajmera, 2017;
Kumaraswamy & Chitale, 2012). According to Sevkli et al. (2012) as early as 1965,
Andrews popularized a tool called a SWOT analysis, whereby the different views of the
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the matter or situation under
investigation can be defined and determined (Sevkli et al., 2012). Therefore, a SWOT
analysis is a powerful tool as it summarizes and accurately represent the different aspects
on the matter under investigation and due to its simplicity, it is widespread
(Kumaraswamy & Chitale, 2012). In addition, previous studies have shown that the
successful use of a SWOT analysis can reveal highly influential factors that may support
decision making related to strategic dimensions (Ajmera, 2017).
Moreover, a SWOT analysis provides a foundation for the formulation of strategies
(Ajmera, 2017). Similarly, according to Kumaraswamy and Chitale (2012) a knowledgebased SWOT analysis identifies and prepares the current knowledge in order to develop
and exploit to a potential knowledge sharing strategy, which can be proposed through the
knowledge identified by SWOT analysis. However, the objection of a SWOT analysis is
that the factors cannot be quantified by their importance (Kumaraswamy & Chitale,
2012). Hence, the use of other decision making techniques may also be necessary
(Ajmera, 2017).
In this thesis, a SWOT analysis is used as a method to analyze and assess the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of both organizational and individual factors that
influence and by that define the factors that either inhibit or enable the knowledge sharing
practices of the case company. For clarity, both organizational and individual barriers and
enablers are presented separately. The factors that prevent the knowledge sharing are the
factors which appeared to be threats and weaknesses and the factors that enable
knowledge sharing practices, are considered to be both strengths and opportunities.

4.2 Data Collection
Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring knowledge, which is done by
using systematic research methods (Hakala, 2017). Carrying out an appropriate data
collection method plays an important role in research, as it allows researchers to gather
relevant evidence that allows analysis to provide a means to answer research questions as
well as to draw conclusions and suggestions for further research (Liamputton, 2013). In
addition, the need for data must always be assessed according to the research aim (Hakala,
2017). Since the aim of the study is to understand the experiences of the interviewees and
the meanings given to them, this study lays a great emphasis on the employee interviews
with operational employees of the case company’s sub-unit. However, in addition to the
findings of employee interviews, additional knowledge on the topic was collected by
observing the personnel of the case-company’s sub-unit, by interviewing selected
managers, and by reviewing the company’s publications and websites.

4.2.1 Observations
According to Vilkka (2018), in qualitative research, observations can be seen as a sign
what is; for example, a word, a phrase, a feature, action, a thought, or a deed. In addition,
observation includes a meaning and they may be seen as clues that bring out the meanings
of a phenomenon or issue in order to discover new knowledge. Observations can be
collected through following basic senses (Vilkka, 2018):
•

Hearing, for example, speech or discussion,

•

Seeing, for example, different texts, the environment, or situations,

•

Tasting, for example, whether something is sweet or salty,

•

Feeling, for example, an experience or touch, and

•

Smelling for example, smells or aromas.

However, the research approach and the research problem have an impact on what kind
of observations are looked for and from where (Vilkka, 2018). Accordingly, the time
spent on observation also depends on the purpose of the study (Aarnos, 2018).
The observation method can be either structured or non-structured observation (Aarnos,
2018). Typically, many participatory data collection methods include a non-structured
observation method, since it is used when the subject under study needs to be understood

63

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

more accurately and, thus, the researcher needs to use her or his experience to learn the
language, activities and cultural meanings of the subject (Vilkka, 2018). In addition,
observation is considered an important part of preparing for an interview, especially if the
subject of the study is strange to the researcher in advance (Aarnos, 2018).

Participant Observation
According to Waddington (1994), participant observation refers to the observation and
recording of the social interaction between the researcher and the examinees in the
examinees' own environment and everyday life. These may be, for example, experiences,
behavior, feelings and interpretations. At the same time, the material can be compiled by
reviewing company documents and conducting interviews. Participatory observation is
seen as a method of data collection related to qualitative research, and an appropriate
research method, especially in situations where one wants to find out meanings,
interpretations, and individual’s motives (Waddington, 1994).
The researcher’s personal qualities are also seen to have an impact. An open and curious
mind, perseverance, and the ability to adapt to different situations and work with different
people, make the participant observation job easier (Waddington, 1994). Vilkka (2018)
states that the degree of researcher participation affects what roles the researcher is having
or given in the research subject. Thus, during the research process, a participating
researcher may find that she or he is a therapist, problem solver, expert, compassionate,
and community supporter, buddy, or peer. However, it is the researcher’s skill to be able
to reflect on the roles in the research subject and to distinguish between the role of the
participating researcher and the observations made as a person (Vilkka, 2018). In
addition, the success of the research process is affected by how well the researcher
integrates into the research group, for example, in terms of age, gender and position
(Aarnos, 2018). However, participatory observation has been criticized as a subjective
and soft research method (Waddington, 1994).
Alongside the collection of theoretical literature, the case company’s operations were
examined by observing the day-to-day operations and attending the sub-unit meetings.
Initially, the topic of the thesis was to describe the sales process in more detail, which is
why the researcher spent a day individually with each of the three salespersons of the subunit of the case company. Although the research topic subject was further refined and
64

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

limited to focusing on mapping the internal knowledge sharing practices rather than the
sales process, the days spent with the salespersons provided useful insights and in-depth
knowledge that were helpful to form an appropriate thematic design for subsequent
empirical interviews.
In parallel, a few selected managers were interviewed to obtain in-depth knowledge about
the case company and its ongoing and upcoming internal reform processes in order to be
able to generate the interview themes and questions for the forthcoming employee
interviews. The interviewed managers were the Regional Director and the Community
Manager of the sub-unit of the case company, and Sales Director and Marketing and
Communications Manager of the case company. Furthermore, the researcher reviewed
the case company’s external publications and websites, and received additional
knowledge on, among other things, about the company’s external intentions.
Furthermore, additional information about the desired state for the knowledge sharing
processes was received via e-mail.

4.2.2 Interviews
Theoretical Background of Theme Interviews
According to Valli (2018), a theme interview is a popular research method for collecting
qualitative material. Besides the basic idea of an interview, which is simply to know what
someone thinks about something, in theme interview the topics and subject areas are
predefined. First and foremost, the selection and formation of the themes is the key thing
in what kind of material can be obtained through an interview. Therefore, it is important
to reflect the research problem, get well acquainted with the research topic and formulate
the themes of the questions before conducting interviews (Valli, 2018). However, the
questions themselves can vary, from a very free-form short list of themes to a very
specific question (Eskola et al., 2018).
Typically, the semi-structured questions are used with theme interview (Hakala, 2017).
According to Liamputtong (2013), semi-structured interviews provide an in-depth
understanding of participants’ perceptions, motivations and emotions as well as provide
a more accurate insight of the desired topic. In addition, semi-structured interview as a
method, assists to produce and group results that can be generalized beyond the sample
65

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

group. Semi-structured questions can also vary, as some of the questions may be direct
and some indirect, allowing the respondent to express their views freely. In addition,
further questions may be asked to deepen the insights of the topic under discussion
(Liamputton, 2013). Especially, when the interviewee answers open-ended questions, the
interviewer has an important role as an assistant to move forward or interrupt a long
discussion on issues on matters that may not be relevant to the research. (Liamputton,
2013; Eskola et al., 2018)
According to Liamputtong (2013) the challenge in interpreting the answers of a
qualitative theme interview is that the researcher may misinterpret the interviewer’s
answers. However, the respondent means can be verified, for example, by the researcher
reformulating the answer and ensuring it from the respondent. In addition, the interviewer
must ensure that the respondents have enough time to form their answers (Liamputtong,
2013). Adherence to established practices for this type of research that as much
knowledge as possible is obtained and that the study serves the research question and
purpose, and yet remains concise. (Kananen, 2019)

Preparations for the Interviews
Initially, the preparations for the interviews begun already in autumn 2019, when the
author of this thesis visited the case company’s one sub-unit a few times and performed
participant observations by spending time with the employees, by attending meetings, by
reviewing company’s publications and websites, and by interviewing the selected
managers. In November 2019, together with the researcher and the Regional Director of
the sub-unit of the case company and Sales Manager of the case company, a decision to
study the flow of knowledge from the perspective of the operational employees was
decided and a rough schedule of the interviews was agreed for February 2020.
However, the actual arrangements to establish the interview times with the interviewees
was not made. This turned out to be a bit challenging. In the beginning of February 2020,
the interviewer contacted the leaders via email about the topic and created an online
calendar invitation with several interview time options. An online calendar Doodle was
used, and the invitation was made with the intention of facilitating the appointment of
interview times. Each invited to the interview received an individual email invitation to
the Doodle calendar. However, by the end of the requested response time-margin, which

66

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

was a 10 days’ time period, only a half of the potential interviewees answered and chose
their interview time via the Doodle calendar. The researcher asked for advice on the
situation from the Community Manager of a sub-unit of the case company, who advised
to contact other participants by telephone. This happened, and eventually all interviews
were agreed to take place at the end of February 2020 in week nine.

The Interviewees
The sub-unit operational employees of the case company were used as the main data
source and by the example of the sub-unit, the findings may be established to all the subunits of the case company nationwide. In order to obtain the material in a versatile and
comprehensive way, all employees participating in the operational activities of the subunit of the case company, five people at the time of the interview, were invited to
participate and participated in the study. Thus, the interview sample of experts working
in the sub-unit was one hundred percent (100 %).
The employees were interested in participating in the study, as it was believed to be
helpful in developing the operations of their own sub-unit and the whole case company,
and their opinions had not previously been collected in a similar way. In addition, the fact
that the employees were aware of the study well in advance, ensured that the interview
request was not a surprise to the employees and that the interviewees were committed to
participate in the interview. All the interviewees had met the researcher a few times in
advance and it can be said that the interviewer was intentionally familiar to the
interviewees. This, in turn, helped to create a favourable atmosphere of trust and openness
in the interviews. In addition, the researcher had previous professional experience with
interpersonal skills, which enabled the interviews to be held in good collaboration with
the interviewees. However, the researcher made sure that she was not too familiar with
the interviewees and kept a certain distance between them. Therefore, it can be stated that
the interviews were conducted in accordance with good research practices.
The topic was also perceived interesting and topical, and through previously made
observations to utilize the organization’s knowledge-sharing practices and competencies,
a clearer model or description was also desired and expected. In addition, the study
aroused different emotions and expectations, as well as to some extent, a critical

67

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

examination of how the results will be obtained and, in particular, of how the gathered
results will actually be used.
The interviews were held in the company premises of the case company’s sub-unit. The
interview environment was a familiar and easy place for both the interviewee and the
interviewer to carry out the interview. Most importantly, the interviewee did not have to
make any extra effort to participate in the interview. Thus, it can be stated that the
interview did not disturb the employee’s typical working day, except for the time spent
on the interview.

Themes of the Questions and the Course of the Interviews
In total, the semi-structured interview questions were divided into four different themes,
which were:
1. Background information on the use of the knowledge – the significance of
relevant knowledge and knowledge sharing
2. Organizational factors influencing knowledge sharing - practices and places for
knowledge sharing
3. Individual factors influencing knowledge sharing - motivation, trust and personal
skills
4. Managing knowledge sharing and technology – management, existing systems
and training
There was a total of 42 interview questions, about 10 items per theme, of which the most
relevant were selected according to the answers and the time required for them. Four of
the questions were asked as a numerical estimate between 1-10, where 10 was the highest
and 1 was the lowest value. At first, the evaluation scale was supposed to be narrower, 15 or 1-7, but it formed as such during the first interview and the same scale was used
throughout. The purpose of the questions evaluated by the number was to facilitate the
formation of some generalizable and coherent knowledge of the interviewers’ answers.
Due to anonymity of the case company, the other interview questions are excluded from
the study and are available from the researcher upon a separate request, with the exception
of the four direct questions, which are mentioned in the results with the numerical
estimates.

68

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

In total, five interviews were conducted with employees from the sub-unit of the case
company. Additionally, three managers were interviewed face-to-face in terms to provide
a background and to give an up-to-date overview of the current situation of the knowledge
sharing practices from the management perspective. The interviews were conducted in
Finnish as a face-to-face meeting over a time frame of approximately one hour. The
interview questions for managers and employees were basically the same even if it was
assumed that they have different perspectives on knowledge sharing due to their different
roles and responsibilities. The differences with the questions to managers focused on their
views on the status of the company process reform and on the organization’s strategy for
sharing knowledge.
The interviews lasted in a total of 9 hours 35 minutes, of which employee interviews
accounted for 5 hours and 19 minutes and managers’ interviews for 4 hours and 19
minutes. The approximately length of the interviews of employees were one hour and 4
minutes, where the shortest lasted 41 minutes and longest one hour and 13 minutes. The
pre-agreed target time was one hour, and it was achieved. For managers, the interview
time varied from 55 minutes to almost two hours and, hence, the average was one hour
and 39 minutes. However, for them, there was no goal for an hour of interview time.
The interviews were recorded on a voice recorder system via researcher’s laptop and
mobile phone. In addition, a phone app called ‘Speechnotes’ was in use simultaneously
with the voice recording system at the beginning with the intention of writing the spoken
directly into text, but it did not work properly and was abandoned after the first few
interviews. The transcription of the interviews was done with MS Office Word.
All interviews were recorded and treated confidentially. After the interviews, the
researcher was able to transcribe the interviews into written form and compile them into
an inductive content analysis. The recording also facilitated interview situations when
instead of writing notes, the researcher was able to focus on the course of the interview,
to the interviewee and guide the discussion around the topic. Interviewees answered a
wide range of questions and highlighted a number of issues they considered important.
The entire material of the interviews was gathered in February 2020 and a rough
transcription of the data collected was done by March 15th.

69

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

All in all, the interviews were conducted with the aim to get additional insights into
employees’ knowledge sharing behavior and their perceptions of the knowledge sharing
practices in a work context. Each theme was examined to gain an understanding of
participant’s perceptions towards knowledge sharing processes in the company. In
addition, the prerequisites for the future reforms were mapped from the representatives
of this study. As the interviews progressed, the researcher developed an understanding of
the situation of knowledge sharing practices in the organization. The results of the
interviews will be discussed next in more detail.

4.3 Introduction of the Case Company
This introduction of the case company is based on interviews with Communications and
Marketing Manager and Sales Director of the case company as well as the Regional
Director and the Community Manager of a sub-unit of the case company. Due to the
anonymization, the case company is presented only very briefly. The case company is a
Finnish company in environmental management industry, whose core business is waste
disposal and waste facility operations. The case company has a long experience in the
industry and operates nationwide in many locations in Finland.
The case company is currently undergoing a major reform of its core operations. The subunit of the case company, that is under exploration in this thesis, has served as a pilot
office for some of the company-wide development projects, and therefore this specific
unit and its operational personnel was selected for this thesis. All the ongoing and
upcoming reforms and development projects require up-to-date knowledge, knowledge
sharing, and knowledge management and, thus, they are seen as a prerequisite for the
success of the reform projects.

4.3.1 Communications Development Project of the Case Company
In December 2018, a nationwide internal communications development project was
started, covering all operations and functions of the company. Internal communication as
a function is a part of the larger information and knowledge sharing development work.
The internal communications development project is ongoing at the time of the study, and
nominally the phases of the project are divided into first and second phases, of which the

70

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

second phase began in December 2019 as it was on hold for a while and started again
during spring 2020. In the beginning of the project in December 2018, a survey of the
company’s entire personnel was conducted, in which one of the major themes was issues
related to knowledge follow and communication. Partly on the basis of these results, it
was decided to start a development project.
The key objectives of the internal communications development project are better
knowledge sharing and better use and utilization of knowledge. In addition,
improvements in transparency, equality and overall continuous improvement in
communications are important goals to achieve. Currently, the situation in the internal
communications development project is that the first workshops are held, and based on
them, a constantly evolving action plan has been created. In addition, in the future a
roadmap will be created for the development project of the internal communication
together with Director of Development of the case company, who has just started working
for the company. However, some of the best practices developed during the project are
already implemented and in use in the company.
Managing the flow of knowledge, such as how it is shared and how it would be better to
share and utilize in the future, is a very topical issue in the company. Knowledge
management and knowledge sharing practices are a crucial part of top-level management
and they plays a significant role throughout all development work in any process and
development work. Therefore, in the company-level development work, the desired state
of the operating models of management practices are described. Knowledge sharing, and
knowledge management are an integral part of today’s management in practice, as the
knowledge gathered on the topic is particularly important when making informed
decisions in day-to-day management.
However, even if knowledge management and, especially, leading with knowledge, has
been recognized particularly important for all operations and development projects of the
company, a detailed mapping of the knowledge sharing practices and how to manage
them has not yet been done. Therefore, this study provides a preliminary mapping of the
barriers and enablers that influence the company’s internal knowledge sharing practices
from the employee’s point of view.

71

4.3.2 Background of the Interviewees
The participants of this research, i.e., the employees of the sub-unit of the case company,
represented different work positions and varied work roles. They all were working for the
so-called operational function of the company, as three of them were working with sales
and two of them were operating with drivers and production. Owing to the nature of these
different work roles, the interviewees’ supervisors were different individuals. Similarly,
the length of the employees’ career varied. At the time of the interviews, one of the
interviewees had been involved in company changes for a long time and most of the
interviewees had worked for the case company approximately two years. Moreover,
previous experience in the environmental industry varied, as some of them had previous
experience from the industry and others did not. However, all interviewees had work
experience from their previous employment.
In conclusion, the interviewees were group of experts with different backgrounds, skills,
and responsibilities. The interviewees in this thesis are treated as one group and opinion,
due to the fact that the case company and the sub-unit of the case company are small, and
only five employees were interviewed. In addition, it has been agreed with the
interviewees that they will not be highlighted as individuals in the study and, thus, they
have spoken openly.

5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
This chapter describes and discusses the findings of the study. The objective of this thesis
is to provide a preliminary mapping of the barriers and enablers of the internal knowledge
sharing practices from the employee’s point of view and, thus, contribute to the prior
knowledge for the upcoming reform of the company’s future communications and
internal knowledge sharing. The results from the interviews provide comprehensive and
detailed knowledge about views of the internal knowledge sharing practices of the
selected operational personnel of the sub-unit of the case company. Thus, the results
answer to the main research question identified in the first chapter: ‘How can knowledge
sharing practices support internal knowledge sharing and its management in SMEs?’,
and especially, to the third supporting research question, ‘How can internal knowledge
sharing practices be developed within a SME?’.
As presented in the previous section 4.1., to understand people’s perceptions, a qualitative
case study research approach and a semi-structured interview deem to be an appropriate
method and was chosen to gain holistic insights from the employee’s perspective of the
internal knowledge sharing practices. To simplify the presentation of the results, the
findings are divided into organizational and individual factors, which are again divided
into barriers and enablers of the internal knowledge sharing practices. It is noteworthy
that the themes are presented in findings are in different order compared to how the
themes were discussed during the conducted interviews. Each subsection addresses the
themes raised in the topic and analyzes their significance in the context of the research.
Furthermore, the citations highlighted in the material are chosen to best reflect the views
of the interviewees. Finally, the barriers and enablers of both the organizational and the
individual factors are illustrated as own SWOT analyses.

5.1 Organizational Factors
5.1.1 Identifying the Organizational Barriers
Next, the organizational barriers to knowledge sharing practices are discussed in more
detail. Later, in section 5.1.3, the threats and weaknesses of a SWOT analysis are defined
based on the barriers defined herein. The order of the barriers is as follows: the most

73

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

critical barriers, threats, are identified first, followed by the less threatening factors that
are recognized as weaknesses. However, no distinction is made between the two
groupings in this context and the barriers are presented as a single list.
Special Emphasis Is Not Placed on Knowledge Sharing
Initially, the importance of knowledge and knowledge management in the organization
in general was discussed in the interviews. The different stance to knowledge was
discussed and the availability and discoverability of knowledge, and the timeliness of
knowledge came up in the discussions with interviewees and are considered very central
to everyone’s work. However, concepts related to knowledge accumulation and sharing,
and knowledge management are not very familiar concepts in everyday life in the
organization’s everyday practices. Comments such as “knowledge sharing is still in its
infancy” and discussions related on the use and share of knowledge revealed that special
emphasis has not yet been placed on knowledge management operations.
One of the four questions asked for a numerical estimate was a question whether the
employees were satisfied with the current flow and sharing of knowledge in their
everyday life in the Turku unit. The actual question was: “How satisfied are you with the
current flow and sharing of knowledge in your everyday life in the unit?”. The numerical
average of this question was 5.7 on a scale 1 to 10, which was the lowest value obtained
from the four numerical questions. Certainly, it was clear that tackling this issue was
important and needed improvement.
Lack of an Official and Shared Policy for Knowledge Sharing
The lack of an official policy and a unified communications plan for knowledge sharing
emerged immediately in the interviews. According to the common view of employees,
the company does not have or at least have not informed about a unified communications
plan or a knowledge management strategy. In addition, employees’ responses indicated
that the company has fragmented ways of storing and sharing knowledge, which
contribute to the consequence of uncontrolled information channels. For instance, a
massive amount of e-mails was mentioned as one of the factors hindering knowledge
sharing. As a practical example, the lack of common rules and policies is reflected in
inconsistent outlook calendar settings. In particular, it was experienced that transparency

74

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

and, thus, the flow of knowledge is not facilitated if the calendar settings are not open in
an adequate manner.
The lack of an official policy for knowledge sharing, which everyone follows was leading
to fragmented ways to share and store knowledge. Although the stance on official
channels for sharing information was considerable consistent, informal approaches to
internal information sharing varied. Some stressed the importance of common coffee
breaks and others considered their own activity and phone calls to colleagues all over
Finland too be important. Apparently, among the drivers, a WhatsApp application with
three different communication groups are in use. However, this was not found a valid and
desirable channel for communication between other employees. For example, there were
concerns that communication would become too informal through such channels, and it
was not desirable for knowledge to be fragmented in many different places.
Lack of Transparency
The lack of transparency played a surprising large role in the discussions. In previous
participatory observations made prior to the interviews, this issue did not seem as selfevident as it was in the interviews. Based on the interview responses, in order to increase
the flow and sharing of knowledge, the management should increase transparency in
every operation and development project. One comment on the topic was: “the
organization is constantly evolving, and job descriptions and personnel are changing and
in general, there is poor knowledge sharing from the top-level management”: However,
employees did not expect or want too detailed knowledge on all development projects
but, for instance, some mid-term reviews or progress reports were desired.
It should be mentioned, however, that the respondents felt that in some ways, the flow of
knowledge and transparency has been improved a lot recently. One of the respondents
stated that: “with a new company-wide development project, it was good that a person of
the project (an outsider of the company) visited here in the sub-unit premises every
Monday for a couple of hours and explained the progress of the project and was available
for any further questions of the topic”.

75

One-sidedness of the Knowledge Flow
The direction of the knowledge flow and how the interviewees experienced the current
flow of knowledge within the case company were discussed in the interviews. Comments
on the subject varied. Some comments were more positive, and the respondents had seen
improvements herein lately, while some commented that the flow of knowledge was
perceived as one-sided and sometimes even commanding. For example, one positive
comment was “the knowledge flows just enough to my needs at least, and without a doubt
I can have a chitchat with anyone if I feel like it, both the managers and personnel”, and
one comment in between was “this (the flow of knowledge from one-way to two-way) has
improved in last few months, but unfortunately we do not have such an open in-house
atmosphere or culture and, thus, we do not have too open discussions about things”, and
one a slightly negative comment was that “sometimes the instructions just drip down from
the management and there is no space for any discussions”. However, one-way
knowledge as top-down direction was perceived as impediment for the sharing of
knowledge within the organization.
Unclear Roles and Responsibilities of the Managers
The roles and responsibilities of the managers raised questions and uncertainty among the
employees. As mentioned earlier, the interviewees have different supervisors, which in
their view, probably influenced this opinion. Owing to the unclear roles of the managers,
the employees feel that they are required to be answerable and sort out the same issues
with many managers. For example, the necessity for many managers to involve in pricing
processes, has remained unclear. One comment on the topic was: “the Regional Manager
and Sales Manager would already have enough to deal with the pricing of the bids, and
that should happen without having to discuss with three different people of this. This takes
everyone's time in vain”. Hence, unclear roles and responsibilities of the managers may
prevent knowledge sharing.
Inappropriate Tools and Systems
The existing tools and systems for knowledge sharing did not garner praise and were
found to be inappropriate for knowledge sharing. For example, one interviewee aptly
stated that: “the purpose of a good tool for knowledge sharing is to make the work easier
and not more difficult, but now it is not the case”. At the time of the interviews, the main
channels for sharing knowledge were e-mails and a series of different meetings either
76

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

face-to-face or through Skype or Microsoft Teams. In addition, the information boards
implemented last autumn 2019 have been in use since then.
It was mentioned that it is the responsibility of the management to provide the right tools
for knowledge sharing. A relevant comment on this was that: “a good tool is one that
meets its needs. The key thing in storing knowledge is to avoid doing it multiple times,
which is the problem now”. This commentary again reflects a general dissatisfaction with
the company’s current tools and practices for sharing knowledge.
However, a there has been discussions to acquire a company-wide intranet, but no final
decision has been made about it in the case company. Both the management and the
employees are eagerly anticipating the upcoming intranet. The lack of the company
intranet was clearly perceived as a very big flaw in the organization, which impedes
knowledge management and up-to-date knowledge flow. Comments like “it is a bit stupid
to struggle with the same problems someone has already solved” and “after all, it is just
silly that there is no centralized information on, for example, raw materials markets, or
the subcontractors used” reflect the urgent need for a company-wide information sharing
platform, such as intranet.
The amount of knowledge shared through emails was also considered to be excessive and,
in many ways, uncontrollable. Among other things, comment on the subject was as such:
“…email is a great way to share information, but often there are too many and
unnecessary messages. This results in them not being read or delved into as they certainly
should be”. Correspondingly, the practices in using holiday absence messages and
calendar settings vary. “As Outlook calendar entries are just marked as 'busy', it makes
difficult to organize joint appointments and, thus, does not help or facilitate the flow of
knowledge, and nor does it increase transparency”. Therefore, common rules,
consistency and, above all, more transparency would be needed for the management of email and calendar.
Company Values are not Displayed Locally
The unclear roles in management and the lack of an official and shared policy for
knowledge sharing are also reflected in the visibility of the company’s values in everyday
life. The case company’s three core values were discussed in the interviews. It must be
77

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

said that none of the interviewees, neither the employees nor the management,
remembered the all three case company’s values. Thus, it can be stated that the core values
of the company are neither reflected in the workplace, nor at least as strongly in the
everyday work as the management might have thought.
From the employees’ point of view comments around the subject were “no, they are not
revealed in daily work. Because of this reform project, the values of day-to-day
management are now more talked about, but these (core values) are not passed on to
employees”. Especially, one of the core values ‘courageously’ was not remembered by
the management of the employees. This was commented as “could it be so that we do not
act boldly / as such, then”. One who remembered only one of the core values of the case
company, commented that “well this shows that we should do things together and boldly
(as they were the two core values I did not remember), but I believe we probably only do
things now in a sustainable manner (according to the value I remembered)”.
Nevertheless, these comments around the subject does not mean that the company’s
values are not conveyed in everyday life. As some of the interviewees mentioned, perhaps
the values are passed on in such a manner that it is not memorable, or, they may not be
fully credible as they are not reflected in the company’s daily operations.
Lack of Co-Operation Between the Sub-Units
It is also noticeable, that at the time of this thesis conducted, there was no fluent
interaction, discussion nor knowledge sharing with other units within the organization.
Comments around the topic were as: “unfortunately, it seems like everyone has been in
their own bubbles”. However, the reform in this regard had already began and, for some
employees, a couple joint meetings with representatives of the different sub-units had
already taken place. In addition, there was a strong believe that the ongoing reform project
would increase and improve the exchange and sharing of knowledge between the subunits. Moreover, the employees were eager to get to know the staff in other localities.
Irregular Feedback and the Lack of Monitoring
In addition, irregular feedback and a lack of monitoring and remuneration by management
was identified to potentially impact negatively on knowledge sharing practices within the
organization. Employees stated that “there are no rewards of or any tracking for
knowledge sharing” and suggested that “it would be good to have some kind of metrics
78

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

and follow-up so that everyone would be provably involved in sharing knowledge”.
However, employees believe that even small improvements and just positive feedback
would make the attitude more positive for knowledge sharing. Comments like “just
encouraging feedback would be enough” and “some kind of rewarding would be nice, but
most importantly doing something together would be important. Us (employees) should
be asked what motivates us and, for example, just having an ordinary meeting in a
different location does not do much of a difference” illustrate that employees were not
demanding about the potential incentives they would like to receive. Moreover,
comments about the company’s typical reward practices came up, of which one was that
“not everyone likes a drinking party, and the pre-Christmas party usually is only suchlike.
For a change, we could also do something else as, for instance, go to a theatre”.
Discussions also raised doubts about how to guarantee the quality of knowledge and how
to know who is sharing what kind of knowledge. However, in the interviews, it was
agreed that the knowledge gathered should be of high quality. In addition, discussions
emerged that that employees do not know whether their development ideas have been
taken forward at the management level. Comments around the topic was like this: “at
least I do not know that the information has been carried forward, sometimes it feels like
managers are ignoring the knowledge coming from the employee”. All respondents
believed that more feedback should be sought from all employees and that the flow of
knowledge should be two-way, or rather three-way, as customers should also be regularly
asked for objective knowledge.
Unplanned and Unfocused Meeting Practices
Unclear meeting practices came up in every discussion and were clearly regarded as a
barrier to knowledge sharing. Employees felt that they had participated in unnecessary
meetings during their professional career in the case company. The main problem was
considered to be that meeting practices were unplanned and largely focused on reviewing
the results. One specific comment about the topic was “the sub-unit's weekly meetings
are not working properly. All we do there is follow the presented numbers and results,
which are important of course, but it just does not feel very focused and, at least, this kind
of presentation style does not inspire employees”. According to the interviewees, this was
again due to the ambiguity of the processes and the lack of agreed roles of managers and
responsible persons.
79

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

However, as mentioned by both the management and the employees of the company, just
before the interviews, the meeting practices of the sub-unit were moderated. The
management also believed that the goal of each meeting should be predetermined to save
everyone’s time and energy. In addition, the employees’ comments around the subject
supported the same idea: “what matters is what is done there (in a meeting), and it is
useless to just have a meeting only to be able to say that we are having meetings”. In
addition, if a person is not participating in the meeting for one reason or another, as for
example, sometimes some people have to be on call due to drivers, the managers do not
go through the material used in the meeting with the person who was absent. After the
meeting, the contents of the meeting will be emailed to everyone and it is assumed that
all those who were unable to attend will also read and familiarize themselves. However,
in doing so, the intangible matters discussed in the meetings are not passed on and are not
shared to everyone.
In summary, the organizational barriers to knowledge sharing practices include:
•

Special emphasis is not placed on knowledge sharing

•

Lack of an official and shared policy for knowledge sharing

•

Lack of transparency

•

One-sidedness of the knowledge flow (top-down direction)

•

Unclear roles and responsibilities of the managers

•

Inappropriate tools and systems

•

Company values are not displayed locally

•

Lack of co-operation between the sub-units

•

Irregular feedback and the lack of monitoring

•

Lack of training and orientating

•

Unplanned and unfocused meeting practices

Next, the enablers of organizational knowledge sharing practices are addressed.

5.1.2 Identifying the Organizational Enablers
This section discusses in more detail the enablers of organizational knowledge sharing
practices. Later, in the next section 5.1.3, the strengths and opportunities of a SWOT
analysis are defined based on the enablers herein. Therefore, the factors that best support

80

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

the organizational knowledge sharing practices are listed as strengths, and opportunities
are the factors, that enable already some knowledge sharing but by further strengthening
them, knowledge exchange practices can be improved. However, no distinction is made
between the two groupings in this context, and the enablers are presented as a single list.
Relatively Small and Hierarchically Low Organization
Although there seem to be a number of organizational barriers to knowledge sharing,
there were also some enablers within the organization for knowledge sharing. The first
and significant finding was that all interviewees share the common vision of that sharing
knowledge is a part of everyone’s job. For example, many of the interviewed directly
mentioned that “everyone who enjoys a salary from the company is responsible for
knowledge share”. Moreover, both the organization and the sub-unit level were
considered relatively small and hierarchically low which, in turn, encourages and enables
the knowledge sharing. Comments around the topic was that “the leaders are very near
and at the same premises, if some knowledge needs to be asked or shared. And by phone
or Skype-meeting the rest (of the leaders) can be reached”.
Company’s Willingness to Reform the Operations
The case company is ongoing a company-wide reform of its core businesses, which
includes communications and knowledge sharing operations. This willingness to reform
its operations is seen as a major opportunity both in terms of communications and
knowledge sharing practices. At the time of the study, already some changes and
improvements were established, for instance, some of the interviewees had participated
in newly launched joint meeting days across the sub-unit boundaries. These were found
very useful for knowledge flow and share. As stated in this comment: "the processes have
been unclear, and now there are clear attempts to work with them through the on-going
new company-wide business-project", despite the past inconsistencies in development
projects, the employees expect the future reforms to be optimistic.
Recent Improvements to Some Meeting Practices
In addition, encouraging comments on increasing knowledge sharing were, for example,
“we are clearly moving in the right direction” and “newly launched Skype and Microsoft
Teams are functional tools”. In the words of employees, the meeting practices have been
really scattered but at the time of the study, in the beginning of the year 2020, some
81

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

changes were done to meeting procedures and they are expected to become more
reasonable.
Opportunity for the Forthcoming of a Common Intranet and a New Comprehensive
CRM System
Although at the time of the interviews a formal decision is not confirmed about acquiring
a company-wide intranet and a new comprehensive CRM system, there was discussions
about the possibility that both the new customer management system and the companywide common intranet may be launched in the future reforms. These both reforms were
seen as a very positive and desired changes among the respondents. Indeed, it seems that
that there is a strong belief among the employees of better future and positive
improvements in knowledge sharing. In the words of employees, “the company has given
a green light that we are finally getting the right tools to use” and “most importantly, it
seems that the leaders of the company have finally been awakened that we need suitable
tools to do our jobs”.
Company Premises Support Knowledge Sharing
The newly launched information boards in the company premises have been well
received. Especially, the production side of the company, including the drivers and their
supervisors, benefits concretely from these in sharing knowledge. In addition, the
company premises are felt to be supportive or at least not directly prevent the sharing of
knowledge, as it was mentioned that “the workspaces are nice, and it is good that we all
operate under the same roof”. Apparently, some years ago the drivers used a completely
separate premises than the rest of the company’s sub-unit employees. In addition,
enhanced attention has recently been paid to the driver’s knowledge and information. In
order to gain and share recent and timely knowledge from the customers, arrangements
have been made for drivers’ supervisors to be present and available for discussions with
drivers as they return to the sub-unit’s premises after the transportation route.
In summary, the organizational enablers to knowledge sharing practices are:
•

Relatively small and hierarchically low organization

•

Company’s willingness to reform the operations (which includes communications
and knowledge sharing operations)

•

Recent improvements to some meeting practices
82

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

•

Opportunity for the forthcoming of a common intranet and a new comprehensive
CRM system

•

Company premises enable knowledge sharing

5.1.3 SWOT Analysis of the Organizational Factors
Based on the previously defined results of the study in sections 5.1.1. and 5.1.2, a SWOT
analysis was conducted of the organizational factors that influence the knowledge sharing
practices of the case company and is presented in the Figure 14. The SWOT analysis is a
summary of the pertinent strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, of the case
company’s knowledge sharing practices, and the organizational barriers are identified as
threats and weaknesses, and the organizational enablers are described as strengths and
opportunities.
Figure 14. The SWOT Analysis of the Organizational Factors that Influence to the Internal
Knowledge Sharing Practices.

Next, the individual factors of knowledge sharing practices are addressed and discussed
in more detail.

5.2 Individual Factors
5.2.1 Identifying the Individual Barriers
Next, the individual’s barriers to knowledge sharing practices are discussed in more
detail. Later, in section 5.2.3, the threats and weaknesses of a SWOT analysis are defined
based on the barriers defined herein. The order of the barriers is as follows: the most
critical barriers, threats are identified first, followed by the less threatening factors that
are recognized as weaknesses. However, no distinction is made between the two
groupings in this context and the barriers are presented as a single list.
Loss or Change of Knowledge
Data, information, and knowledge loss and uncontrolled knowledge change were
identified as barriers to knowledge flow and knowledge sharing. According to the
interviewees, knowledge is lost or changed frequently, even several times a week. Hence,
there have been situations that the real-time pricing information has not reached the
salespersons on time. In addition, customer price revision situations, among other things,
have been problematic due to data breaks, as commented on “there have been situations
where no one has updated customer prices and, well, that is not a good thing at all”.
Furthermore, finding relevant knowledge takes a huge amount of time in vain. Based on
the interviewees’ comments, such as “sharing knowledge takes a few percent of my
working time, but finding the relevant knowledge takes almost a third of the working
time” and “basically 100 % of the working time goes to finding out or sharing knowledge,
no matter what’s the job”, it can be concluded that everyone constantly uses and seek
knowledge in their daily work. Many of them found that they are searching for the up-todate knowledge almost throughout their working hours and, thus, the timely knowledge
would be highly desirable. Consequently, timely knowledge would ease everyone’s work
tremendously.
Atmosphere Issues
Non-interactive communication was seen as a barrier to knowledge sharing and was
associated with a low appreciation of the employees. The interviews showed that some
of the employees felt that not everyone appreciated the employee's input. Apparently,

84

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

personal chemistry may not work with everyone. Comments like “sometimes it feels like
we are pretty easily blamed” and “I don’t know why, but I guess I dare to say that
sometimes it feels like the organization and management are looking for the culprits in
us (the employees)” were surprisingly straightforward and described that there was a
feeling of low appreciation of amongst the employees. Therefore, there was a sense of
frustration and some of the respondents had a feeling of ‘giving more than you get’. For
example, educating others is not rewarded separately but is assumed to be part of the job
description. At times, the employees felt they were making more personal sacrifices for
the work than they really wanted, as mentioned that “there were no options but doing so,
the work has to be done anyway”. Furthermore, a lack of a suitable staff substitution
system was also thought to have a negative impact on the knowledge sharing and the
atmosphere in the case company.
Due to the sensitive nature of the subject, the topic was approached with a numerically
evaluable question. The actual question was: “How would you describe the atmosphere
in the sub-unit, numerically on a scale of 1-10, where one is the lowest value and the 10
is the highest?”. As a result, the average of the atmosphere of the sub-unit of the case
company is 6.2, which was the second lowest value obtained from the numerically
estimated questions. In the words of the employees, management could support and
encourage the employees more often. Comments around the subject were as follows:
“support for my work is pretty poor at the moment”, “it feels that the employees’
appreciation is not properly reflected or, at least, felt”, and “some kind of extra
encouragement would be good, and positive feedback is needed, and it is yet free”.
Lack of Trust and Share-hoard Dilemma
Continuing with the previous topic, a lack of trust among people turned out to be the
biggest barrier that effects on knowledge sharing. In turn, this impacts on the individual’s
motivation to share knowledge within the organization. The topic was expressed in
various ways in the interviews, and comment such as the following confirmed that there
were some shortcomings in trust: “there is not the best trust at the organization. Perhaps
it could also be due to the fact that there has been quite a lot of personnel changes in
short period of time”. Moreover, problems related to withholding knowledge emerged,
as commented “it seems that there are some attitude issues, I guess some are thinking
that knowledge is power, at least the leaders might think so”. Keeping knowledge to
85

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

oneself is typically described as a share-hoard dilemma. Anyhow, all respondents felt that
they had no reason to hoard their knowledge to themselves and were willing to share their
knowledge to others. Typical comments around this subject was “we are doing work
together and there is no point in hoarding knowledge to oneself” and “I have no reason
not to give all the knowledge I have”. Thus, it can be said that the employees feel that
their work is strongly related to the sharing of the knowledge they acquire.
Lack of Training and Orientation
Lack of training and orientation emerged in almost every discussion with the employees
and was seen to have a major impact on both individual’s willingness and skills to share
knowledge. Comments like: “usually new software is announced and everyone learns
themselves” and “we are not asked if you need education and the attitude seems to be
that employees do not need any help or education, which is not true, and even now when
we have had some more education due the reform process, it has been really liked”
describes the feeling of employees to be left sometimes or partially without organizational
support. However, to overcome this barrier, a solution mentioned was, for example, that
“management should stop assuming things and ask our opinions of the needs for
training”.
Additionally, over time, there has been a talk of a unit-specific trainer for some of the
most important programs. An agreed trainer would provide the most up-to-date
knowledge to all members of the sub-unit and would be responsible for training a
particular system for others. However, this development idea has not yet been
implemented. Nevertheless, the need for ongoing training and maintenance of training
was strongly highlighted in the interviews. In addition, apparently new employees do not
have a separately agreed orientation plan, but in the beginning, some more experienced
employees introduce them to the most important things. Furthermore, there are occasional
joint trainings on specific topics to which new people can be sent. Interviewed employees
felt that orientation for the new employees is a part of their job, but it does increase their
own workload.
In addition to the above discussion, there were some shortcomings in the orientation tools.
For instance, an indispensable tool, an own separate driving display in the driver
induction, was missing. After further discussion, it became clear that a new employee is
86

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

inducted by a more experienced driver while driving the typical driving route. However,
the new person cannot follow the events in real time as she or he cannot reach to see what
the driver has on his or her driving display. Employees believed that the scarcity of the
driving displays was probably a monetary problem, as stated: “it is clear that the new
person should have their own screen to monitor and learn how the driving system works
during the drive, but the issue has been mentioned several times to the managers and it
has not been addressed. Now an experienced employee has to stop the truck and show the
new person what she or he did, and that, in turn, slows down the day”. Nonetheless,
employees unanimously state that training and orientation of both new and existing
personnel should be done in a motivating manner, and, in particular, orientation must be
an appropriate and considered entity from the outset. In addition, well-functioning
knowledge-sharing practices was seen to play a significant role in successful training and
orientation.
High Staff Turnover
Personnel turnover was perceived as having a negative impact on knowledge sharing and
have had a big impact on the knowledge loss of the company. Moreover, the sub-unit’s
staff has changed frequently over the last couple of years. One of the respondents
summarized “one of the employees who has left our company kept all the knowledge with
oneself and as she or he left the house, the knowledge disappeared, too”. Another
comment on the subject was that “when personnel change, all the development projects
remains unfinished, and a new person cannot really develop things until he or she has
learned certain basics. This again, takes time”. In addition, some respondents also felt
that the atmosphere and appreciation problems have contributed to high staff turnover.
Dependence on Individual Knowledge
Related to the topic of personal turnover discussed earlier, one major barrier to knowledge
sharing is the dependence on individual knowledge. So far, the organization has not
accumulated organizational knowledge, and the existing knowledge is strongly personcentered. In addition, the knowledge is mainly tacit knowledge, since the current systems
for knowledge are not suitable for storing knowledge, or even if the knowledge is stored,
it will not be found for further use. According to comments around the topic, this is due
the fact that there have been multiple different policies how the knowledge is added into
the systems. The topic was commented: “for example, it is pointless to add knowledge
87

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

into the current CRM system, since you cannot find it afterwards, especially if you do not
remember the exact keywords you or someone else have used. We have had multiple
policies in using different keywords and, thus, it is not convenient or useful system at all”.
The interviews revealed that the company does not have a directory or any search service
for individuals’ qualifications or knowledge. As mentioned aptly by one respondent,
“there is no general knowledge gathered anywhere, but by calling colleagues and
searching through your own networks, things are clarified. Sometimes this takes a lot of
time”, individuals’ own activity and familiarity with the skills and knowledge of others
is particularly important as well as highly personal.
In summary, the barriers to individual knowledge sharing practices are:
•

Loss or change of knowledge

•

Atmosphere issues

•

Lack of trust and share-hoard dilemma

•

Lack of training and orientation

•

High staff turnover

•

Dependence on individual knowledge

Next, the enablers of individual’s knowledge sharing practices are addressed.

5.2.2 Identifying the Individual Enablers
This section discusses in more detail the enablers of the individual’s knowledge sharing
practices. Later, in the next section 5.2.3., the strengths and opportunities of a SWOT
analysis are defined based on the enablers herein. Therefore, the factors that best support
the individual’s knowledge sharing practices are listed as strengths, and opportunities are
the factors, that enable already some knowledge sharing but by further strengthening
them, knowledge exchange practices can be improved. However, no distinction is made
between the two groupings in this context, and the enablers are presented as a single list.
Personnel’s High Motivation to Share Knowledge
It was clear right from the beginning that the individual’s motivation to share knowledge
was high. To better describe the level of motivation, this question was also asked as a

88

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

numerical estimation and on the same scale as the previous numerical questions, that is,
between 1-10, where 10 is the highest and 1 is the lowest value. The actual question was:
“How motivated are you to share knowledge in the organization?”. The average of the
employee’s motivation for sharing knowledge was 8.9, which was the highest value of all
the questions answered by a numerical estimate. In other words, the result obtained
illustrates that the employees are highly motivated to share knowledge to each other and
within the organization. In addition, commenting around the subject confirms the
respondent’s great motivation to share knowledge: “sharing knowledge is a matter for
everyone who gets paid by the company”, “if someone asks for help, I surely will give
every knowledge I have”, and “it is a part of everyone’s job (to share knowledge each
other) and no one can be held accountable for that”.
However, creating a culture of openness to knowledge sharing was considered to be
management task and increasing transparency in operations was highly desirable.
Continuing with this, among the employees, there is a deep appreciation for the industry
and the work itself. This was aptly formulated by one interviewee: “this is a really
important industry and job, and if nobody did this, we would all be in a big trouble”.
Personnel’s Willingness for Informal Meetings
One important factor to enable knowledge sharing was employees’ own willingness to
organize and participate in informal meetings in the sub-unit. For example, the employees
of sub-unit of the case company have a routine to gather to have a morning coffee break
together, as said “we have an unwritten rule that all staff members gather for morning
coffee together. The management level is not there early enough to be involved in this”.
In addition, some employees have common lunch breaks. During these informal meetings
and situations, knowledge is also shared and exchanged.
Moreover, the respondent’s own willingness to gain and share knowledge is also reflected
in the fact that colleagues within the organization were also contacted actively by phone.
Some employees found it very easy to approach and ask for help, even if they did not
know each other in advance.

89

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Professional and Skillful Personnel
The respondents considered themselves as relatively good distributors of knowledge and
praised the general skills of their colleagues: “we have professionals in the house”.
However, the assessments of others’ and own personal skills on using the knowledge
sharing systems varied. Some of the respondents felt that the incompetence of others even
partially encumbered their own work, as stated: “could everyone just learn how to use
our daily programs”. It was mentioned that also managers should know how to use the
systems, as was said: “now the outputs do not look very professional or brand-like” and
“if you do not bother or do not know how to do things yourself, you easily waste other’s
time”.
The level of one's skills to share knowledge was again asked to be evaluated as a
numerical estimate. The actual question was: “What is the value of your own skills in
sharing knowledge? Evaluate your current skills on a scale of 1 to 10”. The average
number of interviewees evaluation of their personal skills to share knowledge was 7.7,
which was the second highest value perceived of the four numerically estimated
questions. Even though the average number was not at the concerning level, there is still
room for improvement. However, the attitude of employees towards the new technologies
and tools and systems were very positive. Even the ones who expressed that their own
skills might need some improvement, had a desire to learn more and were looking forward
to implementation of the new systems. Furthermore, all interviewees shared the same
vision that the individuals own skills plays a great significance in sharing knowledge. In
other words, there was no noticeable resistance to the new tools and technology but, on
the contrary, they were eagerly awaited.
Learning from Each Other and Adopting the Best Practices
Learning from each other and the implementation of best practices across the organization
was just initiated at the time of the interviews were held. Those who had worked in the
unit for a long time, in particular, had a deep expertise in their field as well as a relatively
comprehensive overview of products and services. In addition, experienced employees
had responsiveness as well as caution and a realistic view of the operations of the unit.
Although new employees have not yet preceded to gain deep expertise in the industry,
they had other important skills, such as knowing how to focus on the essentials, using
their intuition, and being able to anticipate. Moreover, the relatively new staff have fresh
90

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

ideas that could benefit both the sub-unit and the case company, if the best practices from
their previous jobs would be utilized. Similarly, especially the knowledge of the
experienced individuals would benefit the organization across unit boundaries, if the
knowledge would be captured and stored for further use.
In summary, the individual enablers to knowledge sharing practices are:
•

Personnel’s high motivation to share knowledge

•

Personnel’s willingness for informal meetings

•

Professional and skillful personnel

•

Learning from each other and adopting the best practices

5.2.3 SWOT Analysis of the Individual Factors
Based on the previously defined results of the study in sections 5.2.1. and 5.2.2., a SWOT
analysis of the individual factors that influence the knowledge sharing practices of the
case company was conducted and is presented in the Figure 15 below. The SWOT
analysis is a summary of the pertinent strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats,
in which the individual’s barriers are identified as threats and weaknesses, and the
individual’s enablers are described as strengths and opportunities.

5.3 Summary of the Results and Analysis
This chapter reported the results of the qualitative research and grouped the factors that
improve and inhibit the flow of knowledge and knowledge sharing practices in the subunit under study. The factors were divided into both organizational and individual factors
and the SWOT analyses of organizational factors (Figure 14) and individual factors
(Figure 15) summarized the research outputs. In addition, the key content of each category
was written openly and illustrated with citations taken from the interview material.
All in all, a mapping of the current situation of knowledge sharing practices and
knowledge sharing related issues from the employee’s point of view was needed and it
provided a huge amount of knowledge for future development areas. In addition, as was
done in this thesis, when outlining the initial situation first, it is easier to find and define
priorities and means for further research. Next, Chapter 6 reflects the empirical findings
with the literature, and answers the research questions. Furthermore, a proposal for action
for further development is provided.

6 DISCUSSION
In this final chapter, conclusions and contributions are drawn by answering to the research
questions and presenting the key findings from the research in relation to the reviewed
literature. The thesis results in an action proposal to supplement the case company’s
communication and knowledge management action plans. In addition, implications of the
reliability, validity and limitations of the thesis are discussed. Lastly, the thesis concludes
with recommendations for future research.

6.1 Main Findings of the Thesis
This chapter presents the main findings from the research results obtained in relation to
the reviewed literature. It is noteworthy that although the factors influencing internal
knowledge sharing practices and knowledge management have been found in several
different studies, an unambiguous solution to the challenges of the case company cannot
be found directly in the literature, as knowledge sharing, and knowledge management
always depend on the context, in which it takes place.
In addition, this chapter completes the response to the third and final research question:
‘How can internal knowledge sharing practices be developed within a SME?’. The
findings are themed into four different categories and, based on the reviewed literature
and the research results, proposals for action are derived to supplement the
communication and knowledge management action plans, as well as other future
development activities of the case company. Therefore, this chapter covers a response to
the main research question of this thesis identified in the first chapter: ‘How can internal
knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing practices be better managed in small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs)?’.

6.1.1 Development Proposals to Supplement Action Plans
Based on the observations and the interview responses identified in the SWOT analyses
in Chapter 5, four main themes of the both organizational and individual barriers are
formed. The first theme identifies the primary problem of the case company, which is the
lack of an official and unified policies for knowledge sharing and knowledge
management. The second theme deals with the issues of inappropriate tools, training and
93

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

orientation. The third theme addresses leadership issues, such as managing with
knowledge as well as the unclear roles and responsibilities of managers. Finally, the
fourth theme designates the needs of individuals and suggests increasing the participation
of individuals. The themes are discussed next in more detail.

Define the Official and Shared Policies
At the time of the study and from the outset, when the researcher became acquainted with
the case company and the sub-unit of the case company under study, it was apparent that
no special emphasis had yet been placed specifically on the knowledge sharing practices.
However, knowledge and, in the words of managers, especially leading with knowledge
was identified as necessary and changes and improvements were expected with this in
future development projects. The results of the interviews of the operational staff of the
case company’s sub-unit confirms that the case company does not have an official
strategy for the knowledge management and knowledge sharing practices yet. However,
this has been recognized in the company and the strategy planning is in process, even if
the interviewees knew very little about it at the time of the study.
The themes related to knowledge management and its practical problems has been
extensively studied in recent years. Today’s organizations, as the case company under
study, are beginning to realize that in addition to understanding the core businesses, and
operations, special emphasis must be placed to knowledge, knowledge sharing practices
and knowledge management (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al., 2013). Typically, companies
lack official and shared knowledge management policies, which causes a wide range of
challenges and problems in companies (Janus, 2016, Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019;
Savolainen & Lehmuskorpi, 2017). Especially, in small companies, knowledge
management as a defined field is not included in the typical competencies and the focus
is typically on solving things through problems (Zieba et al., 2016). For instance,
according to Janus (2016), a clear strategy guides in designing knowledge-sharing
initiatives, informs all stakeholders in the organization about the value of knowledge
sharing, and, thus, enables the dissemination of the strategy throughout the organization.
Therefore, a good knowledge-sharing strategy provides a clear plan of the organization’s
current situation, where it needs to go, and most importantly, how to get there. The key
things to consider in a knowledge-sharing strategy includes the leadership commitment
and awareness raising in the organization (Janus, 2016).
94

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

However, gaining, sharing, or disseminating knowledge throughout the organization is
rarely a straightforward process, but can be better manageable throughout a unified policy
or an action plan of the particular topic (Dalkir, 2011; Hislop, 2013; Janus, 2016;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2012, 2017). This again, increases the transparency of the
organization’s actions (Wendelin, 2013), which was one of the core barriers maintained
through the interview results. Thus, in order to manage and cope with the continuous
changes in a competent manner, a unified policy for both knowledge management and
knowledge sharing practices are recommended (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when choosing
a model for the organizational knowledge management that suits in every situation.
Instead, the choice of the model that best suits the situation depends on whether new
solutions are sought, old conflicts are resolved, or whether the aim is to map and build a
common picture (Solovjew-Vartiovaara, 2019).
As mentioned in the literature review of the study, a starting point for better control of
the knowledge management practices is an extensive analysis of the current situation of
the organization, which clarifies the key elements of knowledge management related
issues, such as levels of performance, the level and quality of know-how and knowledge
of the organization. Very basic questions such as, is there enough knowledge in the
company, is there an ability to store data, information and knowledge, how well
knowledge is shared and transferred and has the company the ability to re-use the existing
knowledge within the organization may help in getting started (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
Equivalently, a preliminary mapping or the current state of the knowledge sharing
practices can be further clarified through knowledge auditing (Daghfous et al., 2013;
Serrat, 2009). By knowledge auditing, answers to important questions can be obtained
and the organizations needs for knowledge can be determined (Daghfous et al., 2013).
For instance, the following questions may help in structuring the knowledge needs and
the existence of the organizational knowledge:
•

What are an organization's knowledge needs?

•

What tacit and explicit knowledge assets does it have and where are they?

•

How does knowledge flow within the organization, formally and informally, and
to and from clients and relevant organizations?

•

How is that knowledge identified, created, stored, shared, and used?

95

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

•

What obstacles are there to knowledge flows, e.g., to what extent do its people,
business processes, and technology currently support or hamper the effective
movement of knowledge?

•

What gaps and duplications exist in the organization’s knowledge? (Serrat, 2009).

According to the managers interviewed, one of the case company’s communications and
knowledge sharing development goals is to increase transparency in operations. As stated
and demonstrated by the results of the research, the transparency should be increased in
every operation and development projects in order to increase the flow and sharing of
knowledge. As a solution for this, for instance, according to Kotlarsky (2015), Loebbecke
(2016), and Ahn and Hong (2019), understanding Carlile’s (2002, 2004) boundary types
of communication complexities and their characteristics, which influences the nature and
dynamics of teams and unit’s knowledge processes, may help in assessing the amount of
social interaction, or intersubjectivity, required in the knowledge sharing phase. For
instance, Serrat’s (2009) five competencies framework is used to assess the organizational
performance, as it identifies areas of organizational competence for knowledge
management. The five competencies are:
1) Strategy development
2) Management techniques
3) Collaboration mechanisms
4) Knowledge sharing and learning, and
5) Knowledge capture and storage
Additionally, when the knowledge flows in the organization in two- or multi-direction,
the dependence on individual knowledge decreases and the organization can gather
organizational knowledge to its advantage (Dalkir, 2011; Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al.,
2013; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Knowledge sharing refers to the two- or multidimensional
flow of knowledge (Janus, 2016) and it should be two- or multidimensional rather than
one-way knowledge exchange or transmission of knowledge, as knowledge sharing, and
exchange involves the idea of learning from each other. As a brief repetition of the
previous research and the literature on the field, knowledge sharing practices has shown
to improve all levels of the organization’s operations (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al., 2013;
Lin, 2007). For instance, effective knowledge sharing saves time and resources as
individuals do not need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). In addition,
96

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

knowledge sharing increases both organizational performance and innovation and
contributes to ensuring organizational continuity and success (Virtainlahti, 2009; Dalkir,
2011; Janus, 2016; Kuitunen, 2020).
Recent research has examined organization intellectual capital (IC) and intangible assets
(IA) in terms of structure and measurement, as well as management and development,
and has found them to be important as a competitive factor, and add value to the company
(Barachini, 2009; Sydänmaanlakka, 2014). The results of this thesis highlighted the loss
of knowledge due to employee turnover. However, this would be more manageable if the
organization accumulated a body of knowledge for itself and, thus, also facilitated the
burden of more knowledgeable employees to share their knowledge themselves.
Moreover, the capital tied up in the company’s personnel forms an important part of the
company’s total capital and, in the future, companies should measure and report of this
capital, for example in the form of personnel accounts (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012).
In addition, interviews revealed that the company values were not displayed in everyday
life, or at least they are not reflected as strongly as they could have been, as neither the
employees nor the management remembered the all three values of the case company.
Based on the literature of the topic, values are playing an important part of the company’s
internal and external communications (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Wendelin, 2013), and
values are used as the basis for everyday behavior (Wang & Hou, 2015; Wendelin, 2013)
and, thus, workplace values affect and form the working atmosphere and impacts the
company’s working culture (Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987). Moreover, an individual must
understand organization’s values in order to consider oneself as a member of the
organization (Luois, 1980; Taormina, 2009). Based on organizations values, an individual
adjusts own behavior so that it is beneficial and valued by the organization (Mitronen &
Raikaslehto, 2019; Wang & Hou, 2015). Therefore, if the company values are
inconsistent with practices or the company managers behaves or acts differently from
what is written in the values or the strategies, then the manager’s behavior becomes the
new norm in the company culture (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). In summary, despite
the trend of setting values, it is worth nurturing the company’s values and acting on them
(Wendelin, 2013).

97

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Qualify the Tools, Training and Orientation
Typically, companies collect large amounts of data, information and knowledge with
great effort and money, but do not know how to utilize them. In addition, companies
should control and organize the shared knowledge, since otherwise the systems overload
with data, information, and knowledge, which, in turn, may prevent knowledge seekers
from obtaining knowledge (Dalkir, 2011; Janus, 2016, Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). The IT
department can provide the best tools and software for the company, but the change will
not succeed without the commitment of the entire organization (Laihonen et al., 2013).
By examining the professional competencies and skills of the interviewees, it was found
that there is a wealth of expertise of different entities, but the knowledge was unevenly
distributed among different employees. Moreover, as the results of the research show,
some of the current knowledge sharing tools and systems for knowledge storing were
considered inappropriate, and knowledge loss and uncontrolled change of knowledge
occurs often and on regular basis. To overcome this barrier, the flow of knowledge could
be clarified by paying attention to the storage and sharing of knowledge, the development
of retrieval functions for information systems, and the monitoring and control of the use
of information management systems. Additionally, more know-how and personal room
for maneuver could be gained through job rotation, reforming or reviewing working time
arrangements, increasing teleworking, and organizing a substitute staff scheme
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2017; Virtainlahti, 2009).
Furthermore, as proposed by the interviewees themselves, increasing continuing training
and planning the orientation of new employees right from the beginning in a very
motivational manner, the knowledge sharing culture would be the norm from the outset
and when everyone were as independent as possible from the start, it would help all
employees to focus better on their own work. Moreover, one solution mentioned in the
interviews were that each unit should have a sub-unit specific trainer person who is welltrained and responsible for the training of others and as such provides technical support
in daily work. Therefore, a sub-unit specific trainer for the most important systems and a
training and the development of an induction plan could bring clarity and transparency to
the training provided by the organization.

98

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

Knowledge sharing and exchange involves the idea of learning from each other (Janus,
2016) and thus, co-operation between the sub-units would increase the level of knowing
(Van den Hooff et al., 2012) and increase the knowledge creation as new knowledge is
created through communication between colleagues (Asrar-ul-Haq & Anwar, 2016;
Nahapiet & Ghosal, 1998). Obviously, in a knowledge-sharing company, individuals’
learning, and the competence development should be supported by giving employees time
to embrace new things and the opportunity to act and to be heard in the arenas of
knowledge sharing (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Furthermore, individuals should be
provided with training and access to the knowledge sources (Janus, 2016; Laihonen et al.,
2013).
It would also be worth considering ways to make the flow of knowledge across business
unit boundaries profitable for all parties. In addition, other suggestion to increase learning
could be the introduction of a company-wide mentoring system. The interviews revealed
that there have already been discussions in the organization regarding some trainings in
the form of video recordings. At the company level, centralized decisions should be made
on the possibility of various distance trainings to be found on the future company-wide
intranet, to maintain the professionalism. Additionally, as mentioned by Hislop (2013) in
a pull-strategy, employees search for the knowledge they need themselves, and recorded
video trainings, for instance, provide flexibility in their learning time, with employees
being able to choose and adjust the most appropriate training time to their own schedule.

Manage with Knowledge
The business success factors are generally considered as areas of strategy, leadership and
competence as well as interaction (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). The acquisition,
creation and sharing of knowledge must also be managed (Dalkir, 2011;
Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Vuorinen, 2013). As it is stated by many researchers (e.g.
Daghfous et al., 2013; Juholin, 2009, Zieba et al., 2016), effective and timely sharing of
knowledge does not happen by itself, and knowledge sharing systems require effort and
time to establish and maintain knowledge sharing practices. However, managing existing
business and renewal processes simultaneously is challenging and requires new kinds of
talents from the managers (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). That is why the roles and
responsibilities of the company must be clear in the turmoil of organizational change
(Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017). Hence, the organization must decide who is
99

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

responsible for managing knowledge (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017), and ensure
multidirectional communication, collaboration and consider individual’s needs in the
company operations (Juholin, 2009; Wendelin, 2013).
According to the a few managers interviewed in the study, the roles of managers in a
reforming case company are not quite clear and this was also reflected in the results of
the study from the perspective of employees. This was evident from the research findings
for employees in many ways, including the fact that employees felt they were being kept
in the dark, especially in matters related to the progress of development projects. In
addition, unclear division of roles between managers also hampered the flow of
knowledge, with meetings being held unplanned and possibly due to ambiguities in the
managers’ responsibilities, employees perceived the meetings as results-oriented rather
than knowledge-based. As is known from the literature, managers naturally have different
roles in the company. For example, according to Savolainen and Lehmuskorpi (2017) the
management levels of a knowledge-intensive company can be divided into two different
roles. In a knowledge-intensive company, the communications manager plays a key role
in setting goals and advancing them as they are familiar with the goals. The operational
manager has an important role in guiding the implementation of goals and, thus,
supporting staff in acquiring and developing knowledge. (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski,
2017) The key is to understand that people are committed to change through an open and
honest communication (Juholin, 2009), which in turn affects, among other things, staff
turnover (Wendelin, 2013).
Moreover,

today’s

leadership

can

be

considered

as

management

(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Vuorinen, 2013) and typically, people want things around them
to change but they either do not know how to change themselves, or simply do not want
to change themselves (Savolainen & Lehmuskoski, 2017). In addition, opposition to
change is also relevant and fruitful for organizational development as resisting change
and expressing ambivalence can create dialogue and, thus, encourage ongoing discussion
(Piderit, 2000). In the case company, the importance of knowledge and the understanding
of the diversity of knowledge is constantly increasing. The research results revealed that
not all decisions of the case company are yet reliably based on knowledge. Furthermore,
correct and up-to-date knowledge are central in management processes (Juholin, 2009;
Wendelin, 2013). However, modern management must be knowledge-based (Rytilä,
100

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

2011) and, thus, enable the formation of a good work community that takes the whole
organization into account, where knowledge flows and is shared seamlessly.
As discussed in the literature, one of the main goals of knowledge management is to create
an organizational culture and work environment that encourages people to share
knowledge (Kuitunen, 2020). In a culture of productivity, efficiency and job satisfaction,
where the people are valued for their resources, the organizational culture and its
atmosphere encourages to share knowledge, and which also has a positive effect on work
productivity (Peltotie & Ruohonen, 1987; Wendelin, 2013). An organizational culture
that fosters knowledge sharing starts from the top, but it is common for leaders to also
need coaching to share knowledge (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). According to Dalkir
(2011), and as suggested by Gruber and Duxbury (2000) as cited in Dalkir (2011), a
working environment that truly supports the sharing of knowledge, should pay attention
to the following characteristics:
•

Reward structure, with the recognition for knowledge sharing with peers,

•

Openness and transparency, with no hidden agendas,

•

Sharing is supported, so that communication and coordination happens between
groups,

•

Trust, as the organization has shared objectives, and

•

Top management support, meaning upward and downward communication.

In addition, giving and receiving feedback on a regular and systematic basis is part of a
successful organization and its culture (Järvinen, 2019; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012;
Wendelin, 2013). Besides systems training, leadership aspects such as rewarding and
giving feedback are considered important mutually supportive processes for knowledge
sharing and learning (Juholin, 2009; Kuitunen, 2020). As the trend today is to seek and
receive feedback from as many directions as possible, a 360-degree feedback
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012), the management of a company must also be prepared to receive
critical feedback (Järvinen, 2019). Anyhow, regular monitoring of the development of
both staff and customer satisfaction is recommendable at the company level
(Sydänmaanlakka, 2012) as it has a huge impact on the organizational culture and
atmosphere and, thus, either increases or decreases the level of perceived individual’s

101

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

work motivation and trust among people (Kurttila et al, 2010; Martela & Jarenko, 2015;
Peltonen & Ruohotie, 1987; Widén-Wuff, 2007).

Focus on Individual’s Needs
Understanding factors that typically drive knowledge sharing in today’s business
operations among employees is a prerequisite for enabling employees to interact and
achieve the ideal level of communication and knowledge sharing. Therefore, as
knowledge sharing drivers may positively or negatively affect knowledge sharing, a
careful evaluation of the individual’s drivers towards knowledge sharing and
communication are important prerequisites for knowledge sharing practices development
in organizations (Ghobadi, 2015; Henttonen et al., 2016). Investigation of individual’s
knowledge sharing behavior, its performance and motivation is the starting point for
understanding what and how information activities affect the individual (Widén, 2017).
Unfortunately, the individual knowledge behavior and its performance is relatively
neglected area in the knowledge management research, and it is often linked to an
individual’s attitude to share knowledge (Henttonen et al., 2016). However, we are living
in a digital economy, where we need to rethink the contents of our work, the practices
how we do it and reform practice on how the revenue is generated (Sydänmaanlakka,
2014).
Creating an organizational culture and atmosphere that support knowledge sharing is one
of the key enablers for knowledge sharing in an organization. (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012,
2014; Wendelin, 2013) In addition, culture and atmosphere are relatively challenging
concepts in the organizations, as they are broad and include; in particular, tacit know-how
and everything that is not mentioned aloud (Kuitunen, 2020). Thus, the power of the work
culture is measured to be stronger than the company strategies as they effect on what is
considered important and what is not (Järvinen, 2019; Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019;
Kuitunen, 2020). According to some authors (e.g. Janus, 2016; Wang & Hau, 2015;
Wendelin, 2013), the organization’s culture of sharing knowledge starts from the top, but
it is common for leaders to also need coaching to share knowledge and review their own
approach to knowledge sharing. In this case, too, management acts as a direct example
for employees of what is desired and valued in the company. As leaders in the
organization encourage, recognize, and reward knowledge sharing, also employees’
attitudes toward knowledge sharing practices improves (Martela & Jarenko, 2015; Vuori
102

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

& Okkonen, 2012). Therefore, issues related to cultural change need to be raised
especially at the company level, as changes in values and attitudes across the company
need to be supported by a top management model (Janus, 2016; Wendelin, 2013).
However, everyday work culture is strongly influenced especially at the sub-unit level
and all individuals must be involved in changing it (Kuitunen, 2020).
Moreover, the individual’s motivation, especially intrinsic motivation (Henttonen et al.,
2016; Okkonen et al., 2018; Tyler, 2012; Vuori & Okkonen, 2012), attitude (Peltonen &
Ruohotie 1987; Huang et al., 2013), and behavior (Dela, 2004, Widén-Wuff, 2007) are
related to person’s own self-image, which affect self-confidence and, thus, well-being at
work. In addition, the motivation and value experienced by the employee increases when
he or she receives appreciation (Kurttila et al., 2010). Thus, management can promote an
individual’s motivation to share knowledge on attending these issues. For instance, based
on the literature, to support an individual’s motivation, attitude, behavior and; thus,
willingness to share knowledge, the case company should focus on the following themes
(Gagné 2009; Laitinen & Stenvall 2012; Rytilä 2011):
•

Personnel decisions,

•

Job planning,

•

Performance appraisal and remuneration systems,

•

Management practices and communication of practices,

•

Leadership roles and responsibilities,

•

Trust,

•

Change management, and

•

Training and development

Issues related to an individual’s learning and own growth should be highlighted in the
sub-units and should be emphasized at the individual level, because, after all, learning
takes place in each individual’s own mind (Pirkkalainen et al., 2017; Silvennoinen &
Kauppinen, 2006, Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). In today’s organization, everyone is
responsible for both sharing knowledge and leading themselves and, thus, promoting both
healthy practices and involve in the activities of the organization (Kuitunen, 2020;
Pirkkalainen et al., 2017; Sydänmaanlakka, 2017). According to Sydänmaanlakka (2017),
individual’s mental intelligence is a crucial factor in controlling the hastiness and stress

103

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

of work and, for example, can be manageable by embarking their own skills and
capabilities, such as:
•

Considering good learning skills, such as the ability to acquire, absorb, and use
knowledge effectively,

•

Problem-solving ability, and

•

Self-reflection, that is, in-depth assessment of things.

In this study, the research results revealed that knowledge sharing among employees
depends on participation and communication with each other. These actions require
voluntary, dynamic interactions based on intersubjectivity, and trust among the
organization’s members (Ahn & Hong, 2019; Hsu et al., 2007; Widén-Wuff, 2007).
However, a lack of trust among people turned out to be one of the biggest barriers in the
case company’s sub-unit under study that affects knowledge sharing. Although the
employees themselves were very motivated to share all their knowledge without any
ulterior motives, knowledge withholding was experienced. This again impacted
negatively on the individual’s motivation to share knowledge within the organization.
According to the literature, it has been found that when the workplace represents the
presence of trust, employees trust their co-workers and managers and, typically, perceive
fairness in how their effort has been awarded (Iqbal et al., 2014). Therefore, based on
empirical evidence, when the employees feel psychologically safe to share their
knowledge, they continue to contribute to the continuous improvement of the
organization (Law et al., 2019). For instance, storytelling can be used as a tool to build
trust between partners, since it reveals personal viewpoints and many times a lack of trust
result from that the individual’s do not know each other or each other’s intentions
(Rauhala & Vikström, 2014).
Nevertheless, trust among people is worth cherishing as it has been found that it impacts
essentially to knowledge sharing in organizations (Hsu et al., 2007; Law et al., 2019;
Razmerita et al., 2016), which leads to a better work performance (Henttonen et al., 2016)
and reduces staff turnover (Wendelin, 2013). Additionally, the social relationship
between mutual understanding and openness between management and employees should
be developed (Hislop, 2013; Razmerita et al., 2016). Therefore, it may be fruitful to
highlight the employee’s training and competence needs in the development discussions
between the supervisor and the subordinate.

6.1.2 Summary of the Recommendations and the Action Proposal
In terms of business development, organizational problems are typically not seen as a lack
of ideas or new ideas, but rather as a difficulty in making choices. Typically, the questions
related to the topic look for answers on how good ideas can be taken forward, and for
how long, and on the other hand, which ideas should be discarded in a timely manner.
According to Mitronen and Raikaslehto (2019) these decisions and practices reflect the
ability of the entire organization and management to operate profitably in existing
markets, as well as the ability to create new growth in the new markets. In particular,
these decisions emphasize the amount of knowledge, knowledge management and the
importance of knowledge sharing (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019; Sydänmaanlakka,
2012)
The same decision making difficulties apply to the development decisions of company’s
internal processes and, in particular for this study, the decisions of how to develop the
internal knowledge sharing practices. In order to develop and exploit more effective and
rational knowledge sharing practices in the future, a common knowledge sharing policy
is proposed by the researcher, which, in turn, serves as a starting point for further develop
and exploit of a collaborative knowledge sharing strategy. However, making strategic
plans does not require much effort (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). Implementing an
action plan, requires changes in prior procedures and facilitate simultaneously both the
best of old and new ways (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). In addition, all this is done with and
through people.
After a review of the literature and analysis of the information obtained through the
interviewees, a more thorough description of how these results contribute to the
achievement of the objectives of this dissertation was sought. Based on the empirical
insights of the interviewees and the reviewed literature, proposals for action to improve
knowledge management and internal knowledge sharing practices of the case company
are presented. Although the case interviews with the company revealed many factors that
already promote and enable the flow of knowledge, knowledge sharing and knowledge
management in the company, no separate proposals for actions are made for these.
However, in accordance with the SWOT analyses defined in Chapter 5, it is worth paying
attention to the opportunities and strengths in the further development of the case

105

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

company. Therefore, the main barriers which were defined with the help of the SWOT
analyses in Chapter 5, that prevent both the organizational and the individual’s knowledge
sharing practices and knowledge management, are used as the basis of the action proposal.
All in all, the Figure 16 outlines the four key development areas of the organization and
individual factors that, according to the results of the study, could be considered in the
future development projects, and supplement the action plans for communication,
knowledge sharing and knowledge management of the case company.

Sharing, and Knowledge Management.

6.2 Conclusion
The overall objective of this thesis was to provide a preliminary mapping of the case
company’s knowledge sharing practices from the employee perspective and, thus, bestow
prior knowledge for the ongoing and upcoming development of the case company’s
communication and internal knowledge sharing project. Throughout answering the three
supporting research questions, which are outlined in the introduction section and
discussed in more detail and answered in section 6.2.1, a holistic understanding of the

106

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

researched phenomena was gained. Furthermore, based on the results of the research, the
factors identified throughout the SWOT analyses in Chapter 5, the proposal for action is
propounded to provide concrete ideas for managing and developing knowledge
management and knowledge sharing practices of the case company. In addition, the four
themes of action proposals are important to consider with the goals of the case company’s
overall development of the operations.
Making strategic plans does not require much effort. However, implementing an action
plan requires changes in prior procedures, and skills to facilitate simultaneously both the
best of the old and the new ways (Mitronen & Raikaslehto, 2019). In addition, all this is
done with and through people (Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). Although the case company has
limited resources to development work, as the literature on the subject suggests, an
organization must be aware of and define its own knowledge system as well as the way
to process, acquire, and share knowledge, and use that knowledge in organizational
learning and, thus, create new knowledge. Concisely, the findings presented in Chapter
5, affirm that it is crucial for the case company to understand and have the know-how of
the how to develop the current practices of knowledge management and knowledge
sharing. Therefore, a shared vision and agreement by an official policy and systematic
adherence on what, why and how things are done, is recommended to clarify and help to
structure the following steps for the future development. Thus, the proposed action
proposal for the case company’s action plans of the internal knowledge sharing practices
and knowledge management, can be useful in developing a future knowledge sharing
strategy.
The theoretical background of the research was gathered for long and earnestly around
the research topic before conducting the interview research itself. The purpose of the
literature review was to elucidate relevant research concepts in order to obtain a
comprehensive theoretical background and to form a basis for research. In general, this
thesis expands the previous discussions in the field of knowledge, knowledge sharing and
knowledge management, and raises awareness about the organizational and individual
factors that influence the internal knowledge sharing practices. Familiarity with the topic
helped to structure the research interview and, also, increased the researcher’s readiness
for surprising changes in the refinement of the research topic. In addition, the literature

107

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

background was refined and structured simultaneously with the analysis of the research
results.
The analysis of the research material was a qualitative content analysis based on the
researcher's thinking and reflection on the collected interview material and which
proceeded to a more precise classification of the factors identified, and the creation of a
proposal for action. The research material was reviewed many times and the processing
of the results was iterative in nature, as the final conclusions and the whole study were
formed through several reflections and writings. When considering the proposals for
action, the main principle has been that existing strengths and opportunities should be
maintained and that the threats and weaknesses analyzed should be improved. Therefore,
this proposal focuses, in particular, on the threats and weaknesses identified throughout
the SWOT analyses in Chapter 5.
In summary, the research found ways to describe and analyze the operations of a sub-unit
of a case company from the perspective of employees, by collecting diverse data and
identifying factors that enabled or prevented knowledge flow and knowledge sharing
practices and as such, influenced to knowledge management. Additionally, the findings
of the interviewees were described in multiple forms, and the thesis provided the case
company with a great opportunity to view the development ideas related to internal
knowledge sharing practices and knowledge management in a new light.

6.2.1 Answering the Research Questions
This section describes how the study succeeded in answering the research questions posed
and how the objectives of the study were achieved. The main question of the research has
been answered by the supporting research questions.
As stated in section 1.3., the main research question is:
How can knowledge sharing and internal knowledge sharing practices be better
managed in SMEs?
There are three supporting research questions, of which the first research question is:

108

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

RQ1: Why is knowledge sharing and its management important to an
organization?
This question is answered and reasoned by the literature review presented in Chapter 2
and 3.
The second supporting research question is:
RQ2: What organizational and individual factors influence the internal
knowledge sharing practices?
This question is answered and reasoned by both the literature review presented in Chapter
3 and the research results presented in Chapter 5.
The third, and final supporting research question is:
RQ3: How can internal knowledge sharing practices be developed within a SME?
This question is answered and reasoned throughout the research findings presented in
Chapter 5 and the theories presented in the literature review of Chapter 2 and 3. In
addition, the main findings of the study in section 6.1. and the presented proposal for
action demonstrates the practical implications and finalizes the answer to this question.

6.3 Reliability and Validity
The criteria for qualitative research are the relevance, adequacy and coverage of the
analysis as well as evaluability and repeatability (Hirsjärvi et al., 2005; Liamputton,
2013). According to Metsämuuronen (2000), the reader should be able to assess how
reliable the information is. The reliability of the qualitative case study research can be
confirmed by triangulation, which is, using many sources of data and information,
multiple research methods, and different theories (Metsämuuronen, 2000).
The current thesis achieved a fairly good validity as interview material produced
sufficient answers to the research questions posed in the thesis. In addition, interview
material accumulated a lot and the questions received in-depth answers as well as personal
reflections, and it can be said that people invested time and energy in their responds. In
terms of reliability, the corresponding study is quite reproducible with a new interview
using the same set of semi-structured questions for the same target group. The study can
also be considered reliable, since the author of the thesis was impartial as she did not have
109

J. Huhtakangas: Mapping the Internal Knowledge Sharing Practices to Support Knowledge Management

previous background within the case company. Thus, special emphasis was made to
ascertain that the researcher’s own interpretation was minimized.
The generalizability of the study is questionable, as the study concerned only one subunit of the case company in a single organization. Furthermore, finding similar
operational personnel would be cumbersome, as the operations of organizations differ,
and the individuals have different backgrounds and competences. However, the research
can be continued by expanding it to other sub-units within the case company, which is
discussed more in the following section.

6.4 Limitations and Future Research
Although this study managed to answer its research questions, like other studies, it has
some potential limitations. Next, the limitations are reviewed and recommendations for
the future research are proposed.
First and foremost, the subject of this research is extensive, and it is impossible to explore
all the aspects and variations of knowledge sharing practices and knowledge management
in a single study. Therefore, due to the limited time and resources available at the time of
this study, some additional aspects were omitted.
Second, this research focused only in one sub-unit of the case company, so the empirical
data was obtained only from the five employees of the operational functions interviewed.
Thus, the sample might not contribute to generalized results, because they might be biased
to the sub-unit’s own organizational culture and respondent’s personal level of knowledge
and interest towards knowledge management and knowledge sharing practices.
The inability to generalize the research results is typical to a qualitative research (Hakala,
2019; Liamputton, 2013). However, this study could be somewhat repeatable in another
sub-unit of the case company. Further, it would be interesting to compare the results of
this study to another sub-unit of the case company. Moreover, the future research could
include a comprehensive sample to concern also all employees of the case company, not
only the operational personnel as it now only concerned.

110

Third, there have been many unexpected changes regarding the topic of this thesis. As
the researcher had no prior connection with the case company, she did not have access to
the case company’s information, and she had to rely on current information from a few
managers regarding the stages of the company’s reform processes. A few months after
the beginning of the thesis, the original topic of a holistic mapping of the case company’s
current sales process from the knowledge sharing point of view, was changed, because
the organization was already examining the sales process concurrently as a part of their
comprehensive reform process. Thus, the topic of this thesis was changed to focus on
mapping the internal knowledge sharing practices from the operational employees’ point
of view and, especially, to illustrate the perceived benefit of the CRM system support in
knowledge sharing context. However, after the interview with the Sales Manager of the
case company, it became clear that the prerequisites of the upcoming CRM system
development were no longer on the table, and the standpoint and the scope of the study
had to be modified again. Fortunately, the operational employee interviews were not
taken place until two days later, and the changes to the interview theme’s and semistructured questions were made just on time.
The final aim of this thesis, to provide prior information to the communications and
internal knowledge sharing reform of the company-wide development project of the case
company, was set at late in February 2020, half a year from the beginning of the thesis
process. Even though the possible delays in the study had been considered in the work
completion schedule, these changes in the topic delayed the completion from what was
originally planned and posed some challenges for the author to find time for the thesis
and, thus, to focus on small details.
In the future, for similar research work, the choice of the topic of the study should be
more precise from the very beginning, and it is important that the researcher knows
enough about the company’s reform processes before choosing the research topic.
Similarly, the unfortunate overlaps and changes in the research topic under study could
potentially have been avoided through more regular communication between the
managers and the researcher. On the other hand, it can be said that the unexpected changes
in the research topic, which were partly due to lack of communication, reinforced the
need to study the knowledge sharing practices in the case company.

111

Fourth, as outlined in the introduction section, this research focuses only to small-andmedium-sized enterprises (SME) operating in the same country. According to the
literature (e.g. Rossignoli, 2017; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Zieba et al., 2016), typically,
the large enterprises face a different kind of challenges and barriers to knowledge sharing
practices, as the SME does. Additionally, the knowledge management and knowledge
sharing practices challenges with the case company are typical of a small or medium sized
company rather than larger company (Rossignoli, 2017; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012; Zieba et
al., 2016) However, it would be interesting to compare the results of this study with a
multinational corporation operating in different countries and time zones.
Despite the limitations of the study, the research results have potentially important
implications for the knowledge management and communication activities within the
case company. In particular, the results of this study increase understanding of the
currently experienced individual and organizational factors, that inﬂuence knowledge
sharing practices. In order to generalize these findings, further research is needed. For
instance, a supplementary assessment of the development needs in between the case
company’s sub-units could also provide interesting observations and insight into the
overall situation of the case company. Similarly, an extended study, which includes both
internal and external networks of the case company, could increase the general
understanding of the needs of the case company’s knowledge management and
knowledge sharing practices.
It is understandable, and what became clear in the interviews with the managers, due to
the limited resources for development, not everything can be developed at once and
simultaneously. In addition, the business environment of an organization is constantly
changing, and at the same time, knowledge needs are also changing (Lahtinen et al.,
2013). Therefore, in the future, the most important areas for development must be first
determined, and the indicators of measurement should be carefully considered to be
relevant to the development of operations (Ruggles, 1999; Sydänmaanlakka, 2012). In
addition, for example, in order to better predict organizational performance, the case
company could benefit from measuring employee work motivational factors and
enthusiasm level instead of job satisfaction (Martela & Jarenko, 2015). Additionally, the
action proposal identified on the basis of this study results, can be helpful when
determining the future development areas.
