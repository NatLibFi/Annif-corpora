Introduction

The case study is about the commencement of an e-commerce organization Salt Gems LLC., based
in Texas, USA. Salt Gems conducts its operations primarily through AWS (Amazon Web
Services) and also operates its e-commerce web www.saltgems.com. The case study report will
highlight the logistics issues and their solutions in the e-commerce trade. Furthermore, the case
study will also describe the logistics strategies which can be used to minimize the shipping costs
to maximize profitability. According to Wang et al. (2016), logistics and e-commerce are
colossally linked together. Furthermore, logistics is an integral part when developing e-commerce
business. According to Agatz et al. (2008), online orders are mostly placed on an individual basis
consisting of minor quantities. The shipment of these orders is quite complex from the seller’s
perspective which explains that role of logistics is more difficult than it seems. The order has to
reach to the customer, who has very high expectations right after placing the order, at the
committed time. The logistics service level is always challenged here. Extensive research has
shown that customers rate the suppliers by their logistics performance, particularly, in the last mile
of distribution.
According to Ramanathan et al. (2014), and Masmoudi et al. (2014), modern-day logistics has
certainly gained more value for the e-commerce sellers. The business success depends upon
maximizing profitability and profitability is gained by attaining efficiency in all operations of ecommerce business particularly by controlling material flow and distribution expenses. The
logistics market has expanded exponentially in recent times. Technological enhancements are
entering the market every day to gain the attention of online sellers. Many features and practices
have been introduced to provide ease of operations in e-commerce logistics.

1.1 Study Background
Himalayan Salt is an exclusive material from Pakistan, which is excavated from the foothills of
the Himalayas of Pakistan. The pink rocks of the Himalayas can be used in making many products
that are globally accepted. After studying “Digital and Mobile Business” from Abo Akademi, the
author decided to start an online business of these products. The idea was to launch Himalayan
Salt products from the author’s home country Pakistan. The author started exploring the different
options in Finland and other Scandinavian countries. The consumer market was certainly there but
not very striking and wide-ranging for starting a new online business. The author started exploring

1

Imran Yousaf

other European markets. As a result, the author availed himself of the opportunity to participate in
one of the major fairs of the United Kingdom, “Spring Fair 2017”. The most demanded products
like Himalayan Salt Lamps, Edible Salt, Animal Salt Licks, and Barbecue Tiles were displayed.
The author received a plausible response, and found a Briton as a business partner. They initially
decided the business model was to conduct sales from their e-commerce web store along with
supplies to Brick-and-Mortar as the wholesaler. The author’s role was to arrange and send products
from Pakistan and to take care of the web-store. However, the focus of the British partner was
always on the wholesale model. The e-commerce web portal has been developed and initially
achieved limited sales, however, there was an immense conflict of interest between the author and
his partner regarding the business model. The author wanted to excel with the e-commerce model
and to add the extensions of eBay and Amazon stores into this newly established business. The
valid reason behind the online sales model is that it requires no additional investments for
procuring the products. On the contrary, the author’s partner wanted to import too much quantity
for the Brick-and-Mortar model with no clear plan to sell them and, of course, with a huge
investment. The author and his partner decided to dissolve the business after just a few months of
operation. The author’s experience from that business was neither a success nor a failure because
a great amount of confidence had been achieved. As a result, the author targeted the even bigger
market of the United States of America. In September 2017, Salt Gems LLC., established in the
USA and started operating on Amazon under the name of Salt Gems Direct and through its ecommerce store.
At the start, the author focused all attention on FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon), where Amazon
takes care of storage and shipping of the products. Salt Gems had a great start, achieving quick
sales of $45,000 in the first four months. FBA transaction fees were $32000 and FBA selling fees
were $6500 including other expenses of $6500 make total expenses of $44200 (Figure 9). Almost
all the sales were related to FBA sales. Surprisingly, there was very little income earned from these
sales numbers because of the huge financial charges of FBA operations by Amazon. However, the
sales numbers provided huge confidence to the author, it also ignited a thought that concentrating
too much on FBA will not raise the income with satisfying numbers. The author started focusing
on FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant), where the merchant has to handle the storage and shipping.
The decision of doing FBM had numerous advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed
in detail in later chapters. However, the author was determined to commence the warehouse

2

Imran Yousaf

operations. Alongside this, there were some other challenging tasks like handling the products and
shipping them through the affordable shipping carriers. As a result, Salt Gems closed the Year
2018 with lower sales as compared to the Year 2017. Nevertheless, profit margins increased quite
satisfactorily (Figure 10).
Salt Gems achieved $16,000 sales with FBM and $13,000 sales with FBA, so this time gross
income reached up to $4000. In 2019, from January to Dec, FBM sales were around $41,000 and
FBA sales were around $31,000 with gross income touching $29,000 (Figure 11). The conversion
of FBA sales into FBM sales and logistics developments will be discussed in detail in this case
study.

1.2 Study Motivation
The thesis study works as evidence that a student gained knowledge in a certain field. The thesis
studies should establish the student’s awareness of what they have learned in studies and to what
extent it can be practiced in the real-life scenario. Exactly that has been achieved. The author found
himself motivated enough to do the online business right after the first two terms of the study, at
the Abo Akademi in 2016. The idea was to launch the online business for Himalayan Salt products
in Europe. Having no business experience in the past, the author went through different phases.
Now, there is an established business under the name of Salt Gems in the USA. Mainly, the
motivation behind writing this thesis, it is a sincere intention to share the hands-on e-commerce
experience with the fellows, e-commerce students, present online sellers, and the persons with
intention to start an online business.

1.3 Study Objectives
The study goals are to share the journey of e-commerce business with the fellows and the keen
learners. I have discussed the brief journey of business above in the introduction chapter. In the
later chapters, the author will discuss the different phases of online business along with the
adoption of the different business models and strategies within. The author will also highlight the
current logistics challenges of the Salt Gems and his planned developments. Especially, the current
logistics practices along with the logistics developments in the pipeline to increase the profit
margins to obtain the maximum supply chain standards.

The year 2020 resolution for Salt Gems:


To improve the logistics standards, to increase profits, and to improve the overall supply
chain process towards optimization and efficiency.



To negotiate all the important shipping carriers, including US postal and regional carriers.



Add different modes of shipping like prepaid shipping and hybrid shipping.



Strengthen the retail sales on Amazon platform with less reliance on FBA.



To increase the sales from its e-commerce store saltgems.com by incurring more designing
cost, marketing cost, services cost, and operation cost.



To get maximum benefits of the Texas warehouse by introducing Fulfillment Services the
same as FBA to other Amazon sellers on relatively less cost as compared to Amazon.



To attract more drop shippers towards Salt Gems LLC.

1.4 Research Questions
The first challenge was to reduce reliance on FBA to increase gross margins, which has been
addressed already. FBM model is progressing, although value addition to storage and shipping is
a continuous process. There is still much needed to be explored and adopted in logistics operations
of Salt Gems, to get maximum supply chain efficiency. The issues and their identification, related
to logistics in an online organization, have been targeted while designing the research questions.
The research questions are:
1- What are the beneficial logistics strategies, online sellers/retailers should adopt?
2- How can Salt Gems increase profitability by improving logistics operations?

Literature Review

2.1 Internet of Things (IoT)
The IoT (Internet of Things) is fundamentally a system of interlinked computing devices,
mechanical machines, people, and objects that are given unique identities, have the capability of
transferring data over a given network without needing human-to-computer or human-to-human
communication. According to Bertino et al. (2017), evolution has been seen in the IoT explanation
because of the emergence of various technologies, embedded systems, commodity sensors,
machine learning, and real-time analytics. Traditional fields of embedded systems, control
systems, and automation enable IoT at an extremely fast pace. In the consumer market, IoT
enhances the technology to the extent where products related to smart homes become well-known.
Smart homes are covering various appliances and devices that facilitate one or more than one
ecosystem. Moreover, these can also be controlled through devices linked with the ecosystem like
smart speakers and smartphones.

2.2 E-commerce today
The IoT advancements have a direct and prolific effect on e-commerce today. These advancements
enhanced the consumers’ experience by collecting supplementary information. Warehouse
management, supply chain management, and vendor management will certainly achieve higher
standards in favor of both sellers and buyers. According to Efraim Turban et al. (2015), ecommerce is not just sale and purchase on the internet. There is much more affiliated with this
scenario. It will surpass the expectations of everyone in the coming years. E-commerce will be the
prime resource to communicate and collaborate electronically. It will discover extensive
information to do wonders in the fields of e-learning, digital economy, social networks, artificial
intelligence, and many more. Efraim Turban et al. (2015), explain e-commerce as an electronic
deal directed by using mobile phones over the internet or other wireless networks. They foresaw
way back in 2015, mobile commerce would be the name of the e-commerce trade in the coming
decades because of its unique flow to provide new services to existing customers and existing
services to new customers. (Efraim Turban et al. 2015, p. 260)
Key takeaways from Investopedia (2020) summarize this phenomenon very well that e-commerce
is the selling and buying of goods and services without physical engagement along with ease of
receiving them at the doorstep. E-commerce can easily be an alternative to Brick-and-Mortar in

5

Imran Yousaf

the future, and can also be operated simultaneously. There will be an ultimate advantage to ecommerce sellers as there is a vast global market for selling and buying almost anything.

2.3 Business Models (BM)
Business models have various descriptions. Teece (2018) explains that a business model is
identified as a framework that is used to conduct business and earn profits. It is the set of practices
that are performed by an organization. The most important part is to control these practices
logically and timely. The consumer will only pay for the value received, which is promised by the
seller. According to Wirtz et al. (2016), a business model is a tool that involves several concepts,
objects, and their links with the organization’s objectives. Traditional businesses are transforming
through technological innovations to seize opportunities in a better way than before. The rise of ecommerce renews the value chain. As a result, all the organizations have to adopt these procedures
to remain in competition otherwise, they may be left behind.
According to Schaltegger et al. (2016), the subject of business models has been published through
different academics, consultants, business people, and journalists. It is considered as one of the
major subjects in domains like management, strategy, information systems, social sciences, and ecommerce. However, in this dynamic business environment, there is still a need to understand
more about business models over the years. According to Boyd et al. (2017), for an organization,
it is important to understand the trending e-business models in a dynamic e-business environment.
The procedure to model an ontology like e-business model assists in interpreting and identifying
the related factors in a particular domain. E-business managers, by using formal models of ebusiness, can acquire support in communicating and sharing the interpretation of e-business among
various stakeholders. The use of numerous models of e-business, works as the basis for discussions
supporting change. The designers of business models can easily make any alteration in particular
factors of present e-business models. A formal e-business model considers the measurements that
should be followed in e-business just the same as the approach of a balanced scorecard. E-business
models can assist managers of any organization in doing simulations of e-business. As a result,
they can forecast these models and their expected outcomes. This manner allows directing
experiments with no risk and causing no danger to the company. According to Evans et al. (2017),
a business model is not a definition of a complex social system with all the processes, relations,
and performers. Instead, it defines the business system logic to make value that even fabricated

6

Imran Yousaf

behind the basic procedures. Palattella et al. (2016), identified business design and interprets it that
how an organization makes the selection of consumers, differentiates, and defines the offerings. It
also involves the explanation of tasks it performs and those that are outsourced, shaping the
resources going to market, creating utility for consumers, and capturing more profit. We can state
that the business model is the value that an organization gives to one or over one segment of
consumers. It also involves a network of partners to deliver, market, and create the relationship
capital and value for generating sustainable and profitable revenue streams.
According to Fjeldstad et al. (2018), the formal approach is important for acquiring the benefits of
the business model. They have discussed the theoretical framework of a digital organization more
referring to the managers, designers, and change agents of the organization. They identified the
major mechanisms and showed how to put them together towards successful operations. According
to them, a successful digital organization is a combination of people in it with their organizing
abilities and with fully supported technology where they perform in a dynamic economic and
social environment. They truly believe that the latest digital technologies are key to the efficiency
and effectiveness of an organization in the digital economy era. Digital technologies like decision
support systems, AI are helping to connect members for better decision-making than ever. It
contributes heavily to relationship management with customers and suppliers. Therefore, the
business model is identified as architectural and intangible integration of business techniques and
as the basis of integration of business procedures. Osterwalder et al. (2002), highlighted that
concept in the below (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Business Logic Triangle (Alexander Osterwalder et al. 2002)

E-Business model ontology
According to Fensel (2001), an ontology is a carefully defined framework, which provides and
shares the common understanding of the same domain, communicated successfully into people on
widely spread application systems. According to Osterwalder et al. (2002), an ontology is the
common understanding of a particular domain that has been identified by its elements and
relationships between these elements. Osterwalder et al. (2002), proposed the e-business ontology
by describing aspects that bring the literature on the e-business model to the next level. He uttered
methods like Building-Block and shared many important ideas in e-business models of study.
Besides this, he provided an understanding of these e-business models along with different factors
influencing them. The ontology of the e-business model given by Osterwalder has four major
pillars that are product innovation, infrastructure management, consumer relationship, and
financial worthiness as mentioned in (Figure 2).

Figure 2 E-business Model Framework (Alexander Osterwalder et al. 2002)
The products and services or whatever online offerings, that has to be sustainably valuable from
the customer point of view, the customer will conveniently pay if the value offered is money worth
and customer is receiving as per expectations. The infrastructure and the linkage of partners are
important for creating value and for maintaining desired communication links with consumers to
maintain a healthy customer relationship. Customer relationship is the important most of the ebusiness model, where relations need to be developed and well-maintained with consumers for
their satisfaction and for creating a sustainable competitive advantage for the company. The

8

Imran Yousaf

financial aspects, sales, cogs, other costs, and revenue structures all are important to be rightly
forecasted and well-maintained.
Product innovation
Product innovation involves all the product linked approaches. The major factor is the value
proposition, which an organization wishes to give to some particular segments of the consumer.
Along with the organization’s ability to deliver that value as promised.
Value Proposition
According to Foss and Saebi (2018), value proposition accords with a value that an organization
gives to a particular segment of the target consumers. ICT has developed various choices for value
creation and has resulted in increasing the efficiency of value creation. This opens up three kinds
of differentiation done from the side of competitors that will be helpful for any e-commerce setup.
First, the most significant step is to make innovation and differentiation with the help of
customized, complementary, or new offerings. These offerings should be digitalized fully based
on information mechanisms of information with the help of ICT or maybe through mass
customization. For instance, an online seller can also propose such a value that is exclusively
personalized to a single customer’s profile. Second, the cost should be on the slightly lower side,
as compared to the competition. Cost-saving gained through direct selling or optimized
infrastructure management for example saving shipping costs via individual agreements with
carriers or finding alternative ways of shipping. Third, a premium level of consumer service can
be offered which opens up many ways to attain consumer relationship excellence.
For linking the three kinds of differentiation given above, Kambil et al. (2008), explained another
perspective earlier. He disintegrated the value proposition into three parts. First, the cost factor,
which is directly related to risk, price, and effort. Second, customers can be co-creator, users, or
buyers of value. Third, performing value proposition, customer satisfaction, and feedbacks aftersales will ultimately define the performance of the value proposition.
Target Customers
According to Porter (2001), an organization defines a value for a particular consumer segment well
in advance before creating value and forecasting performance. Before creating value for a

9

Imran Yousaf

particular customer segment, it is mandatory to define the strengths of competitions, about their
location, product segments, and their offered value to their consumers. An e-commerce
organization can target either to people or to business, commonly termed as B2C (business-toconsumer) and B2B (business-to-business). Online marketing has enhanced the scope of doing
business effectively as compared to classical marketing. Through ICT, expansion can be targeted
in a rather organized way, as there are no more borders to do business. This is both an opportunity
and threat simultaneously because anyone will face fewer entry barriers, but there is enhanced
competition.
Capabilities
Delivering the right value proposition to the right consumers, at the right time, an e-commerce
organization is required to adopt certain capabilities and to do it the same way every time. Different
authors have defined the direct link between capabilities and value. They can identify capabilities
as a repeatable pattern of actions in production, offerings, selling, delivering to create recent
services and products to a market (Jansen, 2017).
Infrastructure management
The element of infrastructure management is the second pillar that defines the formation of a value
system important for delivering the value proposition. That comprises configurations of all the
activities of the organization. These activities play a vital role in producing and delivering value.
Infrastructure includes the assets, machinery, equipment, all other resources, even the partner
network of an organization. The partner network shows that which factors of the configuration of
activity get distributed among the serving partners of the organization. Management literature
described these strategic networks enable ties between organizations that are strategically
significant in taking part to deliver value. These may take the shape of alliances that suits the
organization’s strategical, partnerships among buyers and suppliers, and joint-ventures. The costs
of decreasing transactions can make it easier for an e-commerce organization to regroup partner
networks. As a result, they can target their major strengths in the configuration process of the value
system. Along with this, they can easily decide about outsourcing and partner networks for other
non-core activities and competences. The major aim of an organization is to make value that
consumers will have to pay for it willingly and value results from the company’s configuration of
outside and inside processes and activities. (Remane et al. 2017).
10

Imran Yousaf

According to Rauter et al. (2017), the value chain idea is extended with the value network and
value shop. Value shop defines how value is being created at various service providers. The value
network defines the two-way transactions, based on negotiations. For instance, it identifies some
of these practices as Efficient Customer Response (ECR), Supply Chain Management (SCM), or
e-procurement.
According to Manninen et al. (2018), there are some strategic networks involves at the time of
value creation and value delivery. They can be called as b-webs, flexible and fluid companies, also
called value networks in the literature. An e-commerce organization requires resources to create
and deliver value. Such as human assets, plants, cash reserves, equipment as tangible assets and
patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and brands as intangible assets. We identify human resources as
the people that a company looks forward to creating value through both intangible resources and
tangible resources.
Customer Relationship
According to Abdelkafi and Täuscher (2016), with the extensive evolvement of ICT, it redefines
the consumer relationship. First, these technologies help in making the information strategy, then
provide the platform to know the customer’s requirements well from all aspects. Second, ICT can
exploit fresh ways of delivering value by approaching new channels that serve the consumer’s the
way they want. Third, ICT helps to seek the loyalty of customers, after multiple transactions, when
a customer satisfied with the value offered, which shows the organization’s ability to deliver value
consistently.
Financial Aspect
It bases the financial aspects of the revenue model of the firm and the cost of products and services.
All previously mentioned building-blocks determine the profitability of the organization and its
ability to persist in competition. This aspect also deals with the ability of an online organization to
price its value in the shape of money which will generate incoming revenue streams. There can be
fresh revenue streams.
Further, in literature, a business model has understood two ways, as a conceptual model in which
it does business as some taxonomies like auctions, malls, and e-shops. Taxonomies result in
counting limited numbers of business models. Business model processing creates a reference

11

Imran Yousaf

model to serve a specific industry and allowing them to define as many business models, as they
want, as per suitability. Osterwalder et al. (2005), explains Business Model Areas (Figure 3),
according to him, business model theory comprises three areas. First, more generic, it is about the
definition of the business model and its frameworks. He sees the other two areas as combinations
that describe different organizations functioning with different models.

Figure 3 Business Model Areas (Alexander Osterwalder et al. 2005)
2.3.1 Innovation and Methods to Explore Innovation
Innovation is imperative for any business, it is said the innovation is the formation of something
new or an essential change in approach which is due. According to Tidd et al. (2005), “Most
innovation is doing what we do a little better”. There are many techniques to gauge innovation,
one of the more common approaches used to explore innovation is the 4P model, and Blue Ocean
Strategy shows that how innovation is done within smaller regions get the potential to make
success and change. The 4Ps in the business model defines that unfamiliar areas an organization
can innovate. This model is also convenient to make sure that every area of innovation has been
explored. First, Product innovation relates to what an organization introduces to the world which
is never seen before and never been introduced to that region of the world. It can be something

small, such as a recent version of a software program or as big as an energy-efficient engine of the
thundering jet. So, it is all about what new and exciting you are offering to the market, what others
are not in a position to offer, that differentiate the brand from others. Second, it can process
innovation on any part to make sure the organization is moving in the right direction or not. It can
be within the organization or may with the customer side or maybe any of the internal processes,
the organization aims to earn profits. Third, position innovation is rather carrying a bigger context,
and it is critical to market product or service. It may range from entering the fresh market to
changing the product altogether. Fourth, Paradigm innovation relates to change or change the
complete approach of the organization by their product change or maybe entire solution change
but should be in the right direction to survive in immense competition in the digital economy.
Blue Ocean Strategy
According to W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne (2005), professors from INSEAD, referred
organizations to target Blue Ocean where all brand-new markets are available globally to target
instead of fighting in Red Ocean where there are already established markets and immense
competitions is going on. This method will typically lead to more fundamental variations because
of determined to differ from others.

2.3.2 Business Model Innovation (BMI)
Business model innovation (BMI) is an intense topic for all e-commerce Gurus. It moves all the
attention and focus on BMI in the last decade. It’s an obvious move towards business success
nowadays. A core problem is that there is no clear agreement on what BMI is all about, innovation
at any extent can be called as BMI, maybe there is drastic innovation or minor improvement to the
existing BM. Somehow, The prerequisite of BMI is identifying the problems in the current
business model, or we can say finding sustainable developments in current BM. Although business
models have been used for an extended period, there is no standard definition yet. Therefore,
different organizations and users approach and view them differently (Gobble and MaryAnne M,
2014).
According to Girotra and Netessine (2014), business models innovation can be explored by
unconventional approaches and into unique areas. It is possible to innovate many functions in a
business model without needing radical or costly changes. Some examples of functions that can
be innovated are infrastructure, market-entry, value proposition, replenishments, shipping, and
13

Imran Yousaf

decision choices. The hierarchical authority charts define when to decide, who will decide, and
why are they made. How organizations approached innovation is also an area that has to be
explored. For instance, previous research by Foss and Saebi et al. (2017), shows there are at least
two different approaches to business model innovation, first, viewing BMI as a process that means,
an organization can actively work on and develop as time goes on. Second, it may be an outcome
of some necessary actions had to be taken, as a result, certain factors cause BMI. For instance,
developing markets need distinct types of requirements as compared to mature markets, so is the
case with new technologies. Apart from any approach being chosen, the general idea remains the
same. However, major differences in approach make it harder to create standard methods for
approaching BMI. Organizations will have to face different consequences, and they will have to
adopt unique methods while approaching BMI. According to Chesbrough et al. (2010), BMI faces
many challenges initially. One of the major issues organization’s functions, along with resources,
struggle to adopt the newer business models and changes that models bring. As a result, it is hard
for upper management to justify spending time and money on BMI. Another factor hindering BMI,
a business model that works successfully, affects decision-making based on the data and
information gathered. According to provided information, BMI is essential adoption at the moment
for the organization, however, it’s been overlooked and might not reach management for the
decision process.
According to Linder et al. (2017), the models dependent on the e-value model and business model
canvas both include position innovation. He also identified that fresh approaches to the innovation
of a business model can be seen in two instances. First, while using the business model canvas as
a foundation for IoT, there are definite chances that the current position gets transformed into an
important result as the required key partnership with IT and knowledge gets enhanced. The e-value
model reaches up to the position of innovation as a procedure. A company can make continuous
adjustments in the e-value model until it attains the required position. There are other factors
involved, IoT business model and 2W model dependent on blockchain technology innovate
various other processes. The blockchain technology makes innovation in how network exchanges
value through identifying a blue ocean or some other effective approach for value exchange. In the
blockchain's model, they see the process of innovation because of the improved automation and
requirement for removing third parties from trades like brokers. The 3W model, Why, Where, and
Who innovates the business model overall development process. This process of innovation has

14

Imran Yousaf

consistency with the enhanced requirement for association with business models of IoT. Therefore,
this model makes more focus on various respondents and show that every respondent can make a
major benefit. According to Clauss et al. (2017), the conceptualization of all the expected outcomes
is the right approach for BMI. Organizations already know their processes and their flaws, they
know their resources too, before adopting any change, and they should identify all the problems
and their solutions in advance.

2.3.3 Business Model Canvas
The Business Model Canvas was first described by Osterwalder in 2005 based on his previous
research on business model ontology. Business Modal Canvas kept on improving by Osterwalder,
Pigneur, et al. (2010). Business Model Canvas is a “shared language” and concept of describing,
visualizing, assessing, forecasting, and changing business models. The Canvas is constructed of
nine “building blocks” as mentioned in (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Business Model Canvas Framework (Alexander Osterwalder et al. 2010)
Customer Segments: For whom are we are creating value? Customers are the heart of any
business without profitable customers, no company can survive. Segmenting the markets helps the
company to find groups of customers that they can serve similarly. They can segment markets and
businesses, diversified, multi-sided, or they can be just mass or niche markets.

15

Imran Yousaf

Value Proposition: is the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific customer
segment, including the customer’s values. It is the reason customers choose one company over
another. It solves the customer’s problems and satisfies all their needs in a best-desired way.
Values may be quantitative like price, speed of service, cost or risk reduction, or qualitative like
design, brand, customer experience, and convenience/usability.
Channels: are the ways how a company communicates and reaches its customers and customer
segments to deliver its value proposition. Right channels create the right awareness to let the
customer know about what is being sold and what value proposition is being offered. It helps
customers test through different comparisons in the same category. It leads to the purchase process,
a user-friendly UI would make sure easy access to buy. Delivery at the right time with promised
features of a product or service would make a long-lasting relation with the clients. After-sales
services are the key to keep customers for the next purchase. Channel can be owned or partner
channels, depending on how they righteously suited a company.
Customer Relationship: The relationships, the company wants to establish with its customers’
segments. Customer relationships vary from one segment to another. It can be dedicated to
personal help, personal help, self-service, automated services, communities, and co-creations.
Revenue Stream: is the cash flow generated from each customer segment, what they will pay for
value received. There are several ways to generate revenue streams. Selling products or services
typical for commodity markets. Usage fees for telecom services, subscription fees for newspapers,
pay-tv channels, and music. Renting/Leasing for DVD-rentals, car-leasing/renting. Licensing in
case of soft wares. Brokerage fees for real estate and credit cards. Advertising fees for printed and
electronic media.
Key Resources: are the most important assets for the company to make a business model works
and value proposition to be delivered. We can categorize key resources into physical resources
like materials, machinery, tools, and buildings, etc. Intellectual resources like knowledge, skills,
patents, brands, and partnerships. Human resources are the key people of the organization running
all operations. Financial resources like capital, stocks, etc. Key resources can either be owned,
leased, or outsourced to key partners.

16

Imran Yousaf

Key Activities: are the actions or things that a company must do, to make its business model
operates successfully. We can categorize key activities into production activities like designing,
manufacturing, and delivering products of required quality and quantity in the agreed time.
Problem-solving activities, new and affordable solutions to a customer’s problems. Platform
activities like Internet-based services, financial services.
Key Partners: are key people, from suppliers, service providers, marketers, intermediaries, and
other strategic partners that make the business operations flow swiftly. There are four distinct types
of partnerships. First, strategic alliances between non-competitors, second, a partnership between
competitors, third, joint ventures to develop new business, and fourth, buyer-supplier partnerships
to assure reliable supplies. There are different modes of partnerships, to either fetch optimization
or economies of scale. However, the primary aim is the reduction of risk and uncertainty.
Cost Structure: includes all costs incurred to operate a business model, includes fixed cost, the
variable cost, sunk cost. Nowadays it would be a blend of economies of scale and economies of
scope.

2.4 Logistics Aspects of an Online Business
Logistics is the procedure to manage the movement, storage, procurement, parts, inventory, and
the linked flows of information. It is done through the various channels of a firm. As a result, cost
minimizes and profit maximizes.
According to Murphy et al. (2018), in an e-commerce business, logistics is the most important part
of the supply chain process. It controls and integrates adequate storage to maintain the flow of
information, products, and services from the starting point to the consumption point, for fulfilling
the demands of customers. According to Mena et al. (2016), the industry of internet retail is now
an influential part of the overall retail sector. The sector includes present retailers with physical
stores, doing the selling of different products and services over the internet. Some organizations
are not operating physical retail stores but just use e-commerce websites and other platforms for
selling their products and services to the consumers. The retailers, that mainly sell the products
and services through their physical stores only, are termed as Brick-and-Mortar in the literature of
retail. The retailers, that sell the products and services through their physical stores, as well as
online stores, are termed as Click-and-Mortar. The retailers, that sell the products and services
through their online stores only, are termed as Pure-play. For instance, Wal-Mart is a Click-and17

Imran Yousaf

Mortar organization that operates physical stores and an online website simultaneously for sale of
their products. Amazon.com which is an example of Pure-play conducts selling through an online
platform only. Amazon is an example of an enormous platform, where many manufacturers,
wholesalers, and retailers conduct the business and target new customers. Amazon provides ease
of operations to all kinds of sellers according to their needs. Amazon stores and delivers the
products of these sellers, and also allows these sellers to store and deliver their products on their
own. However, Amazon strictly follows and lets these sellers follow, the “Seller code of conduct”
to provide confidence to their online consumers.
According to Rai et al. (2018), Pure-play stores need effective supply chain models for fulfilling
the requirements of their consumers with the help of responsive distribution centers. The shipping
can be done from these distribution centers by own arrangements or can be outsourced, but the
target is to satisfy the end consumers. However, the structure of the internal supply chain should
be challenged at all times to produce positive results. Third-party logistics organizations that do
the stocking of items for fulfilling consumer orders along with e-commerce retailers operate
distribution centers. It identifies the consumer side of the chain as the differentiating factor for
retailers on the internet. In the environment of traditional retail, physical stores show the channels
with the help of which the consumer gets the products or gets the services. Replenishments are
sent to stores through different distribution centers to ensure the availability of items within stores.
It then does the replenishment of objects is then to shelves of stores through backrooms. In contrast
to this, the website works as the storefront-end in case of internet retail with the help of which
consumers get entrance and do browsing of information related to products. Consumers also make
purchases through it.
According to Haag et al. (2020), in the click-and-mortar environment, the retailers of multichannels have leveraged the network of the physical stores and different other online abilities to
enhance the total number of sales. Consumers can log onto the websites of retailers, can order the
item, and schedule to pick it up in the store. Retailers can involve unique things on standard
shipping to the retail store from the center of the distribution. This is done while leveraging the
scale economies and cheaper rates of transportation. According to Izogo et al. (2018), e-retailing
is also apprehensive with the sale of services and products between consumers and organizations
through electronic media. The online organizations that sell to individual customers are termed as

18

Imran Yousaf

B2C e-commerce. This kind of e-commerce is more famous as compared to different other types.
Amazon is a general merchandiser that does the selling of customer items to retail customers.
According to Nica (2015), the Key features of B2C models are heaps of advertisement, a handsome
investment in hardware and software of the online channel to attract the huge number of customers
towards online channels. We must back all are up by satisfactory after-sales services to keep the
customer for a consistent appearance to the channel. According to Wang et al. (2016), there is a
closer link between e-commerce and logistics. Logistics is an integral part while developing ecommerce. There is an enormous influence of e-commerce over logistics, and it is completely
associated with the future growth of e-commerce. This connection contradicts logistics to build
the development of e-commerce and e-commerce gives a resource for resolving the contradiction.
The solution to e-commerce contradiction also requires logistics to provide the funds and fresh
ways to operate. The more competitive business model needs the latest approaches to logistics
operations.
According to Agatz et al. (2008), online orders are mostly placed on an individual basis consisting
of minor quantities. The shipment of these orders is quite complex from the seller’s perspective
which explains that role of logistics is more difficult than it seems. The order has to reach to the
customer, who has very high expectations right after placing the order, at the committed time. The
logistics service level is always challenged here. Extensive research has shown that customers rate
the suppliers by their logistics performance, particularly, in the last mile of distribution.
According to Bernon et al. (2016), there is an inevitable emergence of electronic commerce.
However, in the case, when a consumer wishes to purchase the original items through a virtual
system, then it requires logistics. The appearance of electronic commerce speeds up the growth of
the industry of logistics. As there is a close connection between application development and
system technology, so logistics and electronic commerce are linked closely. According to Zhang
et al. (2019), commerce flow is more dependent on the support of logistics. Therefore, it can be
stated that agile logistics operations are significant components of e-commerce.
According to Joong-Kun Cho et al. (2008), while discussing e-commerce, the initial investments,
sales numbers with their cost of goods sold, the flexibility of logistics and finding core competence,
many companies adopt the outsourcing model as they think it is a more appropriate and effective
way to fulfill a customer’s needs. Again it is not as easy as it seems, it may be workable with the

19

Imran Yousaf

companies who have compromised logistics capacity, and they are in their early days to find the
sales rhythm. It may be a wrong decision for companies who are enjoying their sales growth and
need to establish their own logistics capacity as a long-term goal. They should avoid the overlying
investments on outsourced logistic services. The business success depends upon maximizing
profitability and profitability is gained by attaining efficiency in all operations of e-commerce
business, particularly by controlling material flow and distribution expenses. The logistics market
has expanded exponentially in recent times, more technological enhancements coming into the
market to gain the attention of online sellers, in that regard, many features and practices have been
introduced to provide ease of operations in the e-commerce logistics (Ramanathan et al. 2014),
(Masmoudi et al. 2014), and (Bask et al. 2012). Following Fernie & Sparks (2018), distribution
centers get the orders of consumers and then deliver these products to addresses of the consumer
directly. Occasionally, with the traditional model of retail, orders get shipped through wholesalers,
vendors, or manufacturers straight to various retail stores. Same as this, internet retailers also
leverage the selection of products and leverage the inventory of the partners of the supply chain to
service consumers.

Figure 5 The Structure of Internet Retail Supply Chain, (Colby Ronald Chiles et al. 2005)

As per figure 5, the new millennium started with that basic model. The consumer places the order
through the website. The internet retailer can then make the shipment of the item if it is available.
If an e-commerce retailer does not have that item in the stock that connects him to a third party,

20

Imran Yousaf

manufacturer, or a wholesale supplier shipping of the item to the consumer directly. This procedure
of drop shipping is a factor that permits internet retailers to give unlimited choices.
Examples of logistics best practices by online retail companies
Amazon.com
In the year 1994, Amazon got to incorporate, and it started public offering in the year 1997. There
were around $6.92 billion in revenues for the year 2004. It was 31 percent more than compared to
the year 2003. In the year 2003, Amazon got profitable for the very first time. Amazon has done
good competition with other traditional and internet retailers based on cost, convenience, and
selection. Amazon leverages the network of the supply chain that involves different inventories,
distribution centers operated internally, and also various other partners for giving a wide choice of
items. In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched, and right after its launching Amazon
came out with another wonderful service FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) which complimented each
other very well. These developments changed the e-commerce scenario altogether. It enabled
many new entrants to sell online.

Figure 6 Fulfillment by Amazon, Amazon.com.

21

Imran Yousaf

In figure 6, we can see the operations of AWS and FBA, FBA, as the solution to the problems of
many internet retailers. All one needs to do, send products to one of the Amazon warehouses and
list them at the Amazon store. After-sales confirmation, Amazon takes care of its delivery by doing
all associated steps. This kind of ease for suppliers has its value for which Amazon charges, and
they charge heavily. Sellers have no harm to pay for that as they have very little to do with all the
processes. At this larger scale, Amazon has hugely invested in that delivery network that can do
wonders, they have now robots to pick and pack orders with more precision and optimization.
They can afford a huge number of workers. All these investments on infrastructure do not cost
Amazon very high as they have their FBA fees to take care of all this. Sellers are happy with that
convenience they are receiving and Amazon is happy as they are progressing by leaps and bound.
Over the period, Amazon introduced almost every kind of product which is the everyday need of
common people, and that business model makes them big giant hard to defeat and becoming
stronger day by day (Smith & Linden, 2017).
Amazon Delivery Excellence
Amazon recognized early that consumers will not like high prices for delivery. Providing them
affordability that brought Amazon to where it is today. Even free delivery has its cost and they
invested billions. Apart from the FBA fees and Amazon Prime fees. The company even outsourced
other private shippers like UPS and Fed-ex, since they are becoming big they want to introduce
fresh ways of “Insourcing” heavy investments on delivery infrastructures, including a fleet of
Boeing 767’s. The last step of sending to consumer place is costly, sending trucks across the
country are simple but then sent from the warehouse to 500 different homes is a tough task.
Amazon Flex, a shared economy model or a network of crowdsourced delivery drivers. This “Uber
for delivery” is now Amazon is eyeing upon. This new dissection could also be Amazon’s chance
to turn its deprived employment reputation around and start improving its practices.
eBay Inc.
eBay Inc. started in the year 1995 and is an auction marketplace present online. eBay links different
suppliers and buyers on its platform. eBay grew rapidly since inception and it bases its
differentiation from Amazon on the unlimited selection of products and perfect cost competition
that gets offered through different online auctions, however, Amazon only allows the fixed-price
format. In the year 2003, there were $3.27 billion revenues, and total income was around $778.2
22

Imran Yousaf

million. Over five years from the year 1998 to the year 2003, the rates of sales growth were 75
percent, and there was 162.5 percent earning per share (Ackley & Aparo, 2016).
Geetha et al. (2019) identified internet retail to be the most active marketplace, where customers
are kept informed of costs and items. eBay has extended the idea into some perfect supply chain.
Here, the direct connection of suppliers is made with buyers with no uninterrupted service or
intermediaries.

Research Methodology

3.1 Research Approach: Case Study Method
According to Thomas (2011), and Hyett et al. (2014), considerable research has been conducted
about limitations of case study methods as compared to other methods and their reliability. Despite
that, the case study method is increasingly common among researchers. The designs and contents
of case studies can look very different from each other, but they deliver the output convincingly.
According to Solberg et al. (2002), the case study method is extremely difficult to define because
there is no easy clarification for it. According to Jacobson (2002), the definition of a case study
may be called a concentrated study of a person, group of persons, and an entity with the objectives
of highlighting a specific point of view. Thomas (2011) explains that the case study analysis is a
system analysis that comprises a complete view by one or more than one method. According to
Cousin (2005), the aim of the case study method is not to analyze cases, but it is a great way to
define the cases to explore and more easily understand them.
“The case study method “explores a real-life, contemporary bounded system (a case) or multiple
bounded systems (cases) over time, through detailed, in-depth data collection involving multiple
sources of information… and reports a case description and case themes” (Creswell, 2013, p. 97).
According to Gerring (2004), the case study approach usually has two purposes. First, studies of
its unit. Second, studies of a bigger group of units. Based on case studies, the conclusion drawn
can either be explanatory or provable. Such issues can confuse the design of the case study, but
these are the characteristics of that. According to Yin (2003), the researcher has to consider wisely
the type of case study. The researcher should carefully select whether it is going to be a single case
study or multiple case studies to understand the phenomenon and context completely. Another
important point is to consider that the researcher should be able to analyze the data in each situation
and across the situations.
According to Gustafsson (2017), the case study method provides data in an efficient and usable
format for those who are reading data and observing results. However, there can be different
concepts of the researcher involved in the final result. The objective of this method is to assist the
reader in identifying the particular ideas to whom they may concern.

24

Imran Yousaf

According to Lowe et al. (2018), the research can be done related to some single individual, group,
event, or business. The research includes the collection of in-detailed information and data related
to the entity of the individual with the help of unique methods of collection and ongoing
experiences. The case study method is seen as responsible for the intensive research of a unit. It is
the exploration and investigation of an event in more detail. It provides an in-depth and detailed
analysis of a game or person. This is particularly the case with various subjects that cannot be
recreated ethically or physically.
According to Harrison et al. (2017), the observations give more information related to the input
procedures. It can provide a path that is already taken into action and already resulted in specific
outcomes. Any other can easily replicate these observations and outcomes without researching the
same capacity. Case studies give practical facts to the researchers because it develops such data
and information in real-time. It provides gives way forward to researchers for turning the ideas
into information, then get them verified as facts which may work as a proven path of negative or
positive development.
The present research depends on a single case study method. Salt Gems LLC single case study has
been selected to examine logistics operations of an ongoing e-commerce organization by narrating
the current logistics practices and the future developments in their logistics framework, It also
provides verifiable data and information through directly observing the entities involved, which
will not only be helpful for Salt Gems but also for any online seller working in that same domain
where applicable. The case study also includes the Salt Gems’ information about commencement
and a way forward to date.

3.2 Case Company
The case company is Salt Gems LLC. Formed in 2017 in Texas, USA. It started the initial sales
from Amazon platform through FBA, later through FBM while using its own warehouse space and
with a blend of both FBA and FBM. FBA resulted in good sales and recognition but very less
profit. Later, reliance on FBA was decreased by outsourcing its own space and having a corporate
agreement with shipping companies which resulted in a significant increase in profit.
The following are the two business model canvas in figure 7 and figure 8. The business model
canvas in Figure 7 is the UK modal of Salt business and canvas used in figure 8 is the USA modal
of Salt Gems LLC. There are significant differences in both business models.
25

Imran Yousaf

Initial Business Model Canvas of Salt Business in UK Market
As mentioned, The UK Business model was more focused on wholesale to Brick-and-Mortar with
relatively less focus on an e-commerce store. However, to understand changes that the author has
adopted to the current model of Salt Gems LLC. In the USA, it is better to have a glimpse of the
business model canvas of the UK market wholesale model.

Figure 7 Salt Gems: Business Model Canvas Framework UK Business Model

At the initial stage of the Himalayan Salt business in the UK, it divided the logistic operations into
unique parts. The first movement is from mines to production facility, production facility to the
seaport, and finally to the UK warehouse via sea vessel. Products are ready to be listed on the web
to ship to customers within the UK. There were orthodox ways adopted as far as shipping within
the UK was concerned, within fifty kilometers radius delivery done via local vehicle, bus cargo,
and use of local shipping companies. The experience was neither a success nor a failure because
serving Brick-and-Mortar was not the target. Although, there were extensive lessons in this phase.
The Pakistan side operation was established further towards optimization. Developed expertise in
raw material buying, established speedy production, enhanced the supply chain activities,

26

Imran Yousaf

particularly, the logistics operations from excavation to exporting abroad warehouse and
warehouse to the customers.
Business Model Canvas of Salt Gems LLC in USA Market

Figure 8 Salt Gems: Business Model Canvas Framework USA Business Model

The logistics operations from exporting country Pakistan are almost the same as the time of UK
business, infect, more advanced. In the UK phase, the movement from mines to production facility
done through rented vans now Salt Gems managed through own delivery vehicles. It fills the rented
container at the production facility and sent to the port city. The best way to send relatively heavy
Himalayan Salt products is by sea vessels to take advantage of affordable shipping costs per unit.
After reaching a warehouse in Texas, Products are ready to be listed on FBA or FBM and to be
sent to all over the USA via Fed-Ex and other carriers. In the early days of Salt Gems, Amazon
FBA was taking care of all storage and shipping.

27

Figure 9 Salt Gems: The Year 2017, Account Activity Report.

The starting year 2017 was exciting because of the many challenges and taking initiatives. Listing
all products as FBA, the first container sent to Amazon warehouse to let them take care of storage
and shipping. Apart from achieving satisfactory sales figures of $45,000 by an infant business,
there was almost no profitability. FBA transaction fees were $32000 and FBA selling fees $6500.
Other expenses of $6500 make it $44200 as total expenses (Figure 9). It related almost all the sales
to FBA sales. As an entrepreneur, that start was a confidence booster. One side, excited for sales
achievement, another side, worried about profitability.

28

Imran Yousaf

Figure 10 Salt Gems: The Year 2018, Account Activity Report.

The year 2018 was eventful, the immediate attention after the year 2017 to increase the profitability
by depending less on FBA. The first few months carried on with FBA operations, however, the
author added value to the operations by searching an affordable warehouse and started putting the
stocks in there, instead of Amazon warehouses. That transformation has resulted in relatively low
sales numbers in 2018, only $29,000 with $2500 expenses. The target of less reliance on FBA was
achieved progressively. It ended the achievements up selling $13,000 via FBA and $16,000 FBM
(Figure 10).

Figure 11 Salt Gems: The Year 2019, Account Activity Report.

The entry in the year 2019 was well-prepared and well-thought-out. The warehouse services and
shipping activities have already gained quite an experience. Salt Gems closed the year with total
sales touching $70,000. FBM sales were $41,000 and FBA sales were around $30,000. FBA
transaction fees were $13000, FBA selling fees were $4500, Seller fulfilled selling fees were
$6000. Salt Gems purchased some $13,000 worth shipping labels (Figure 11).
Such business in 2019 also opened up the ways and increased bargaining power for signing new
agreements with shipping companies like FedEx and UPS to introduce new corporate rates for the
higher slab of 2000 plus units.

The sales dashboard 2019 shows the so far progress of Salt Gems. 2561 units have been sold valued
at approximately $71,000 with 1.19 average units per order along with a $33 average sales value
per order (Figure 12).

3.3 Author’s Role
After studying information systems in Finland, the author was determined to conduct online
business. As an entrepreneur, the author is exhaustively involved in all phases of the Himalayan
Salt business. Salt Gems’ idea came into reality when the author dissolved his semi-successful
business in the UK market. From that first experience, the author established many professional
contacts related to raw material arrangements, product manufacturing, and logistics operations.
The next step was to establish a firm in the USA to start Amazon’s operations. The author went to
the USA, opened a firm, and registered with AWS. Later, selected Himalayan Salt products had
been sent to the Amazon fulfillment center and listed those products on the AWS. The products
were already well in demand and it listed them through 100% FBA, hence; the response was
enormous in the very first year. The first supplies sold quickly with handsome sales numbers.
However, the only point of worry was almost no earnings, Amazon FBA charges were

31

Imran Yousaf

extraordinary. The sales were better, there were some excellent reviews left by customers on Salt
Gems and it was a very motivating factor.
Positive ratings and store rankings have been gradually achieved in the very first year. The author
kept on thinking about the fresh ways of increasing revenue and profits. It took extensive time and
effort to arrange the warehouse and shipping contacts to reduce the reliance on FBA and start
selling through FBM. Although it was never intended to leave practicing FBA, it was intended to
reduce reliance on FBA operations. FBA listings provide ease of liquidation in case of low
demanded and stuck products. FBM provided tremendous confidence to the author. That model
started generating the desired results. However, it was the outcome of many tiring days and nights
when start-ups get early responses; the entrepreneurs get extra energy to handle tough situations
on their own. Salt Gems also started web sales from saltgems.com to enhance online sales. After
three years of operations, carriers like UPS and FedEx started considering Salt Gems as a sound
customer. It usually provides the corporate rates, a cushion of 15% to 25%, which generated some
extra amount out of every single order. Any listed product with less FBM sales can easily be
transferred to FBA to liquidate quickly as Amazon algorithms boost it to get the job done.
All the matters, strategies, and actions are being learned, experienced, and done over the period.
There is a list of activities that have been done, moving between the USA and Pakistan to establish
the business for over three years now. However, the exciting effects of being an entrepreneur are
mind-blowing. In the “case study” part, the value additions will be discussed. Particularly about
logistics and shipping procedures according to the research questions.

Case Study

Until this chapter, Salt Gems’ establishment has been discussed. In this chapter, the current
logistics practices along with planned future developments will be discussed in detail. In the
literature, Izogo et al. (2018), and Nica (2015), have also highlighted the importance of B2C
businesses by investing in the online channels, proper advertisements, own warehouse, own
shipping operations, and after-sales services to earn more reputation and independence. Salt Gems
follows all those vital rules to conduct the business. Shipping is one of those fundamental
operations of the e-commerce business that every company has to adapt and conduct successfully.
Every online seller wants to reduce the shipping cost to maximize the profits without
compromising on the sales numbers. The online buyers like free shipping offer, and for sellers, the
free shipping offers are not free at all. It already includes the price of shipping that is already in
the product offered price. Same is the case with Salt Gems, always been trying to cut the shipping
costs by varying the carriers and using the U.S. Postal Service for regional deliveries, sometimes,
to cut shipping costs almost in half.
Advantages and disadvantages of FBM
Before discussing Salt Gems’ current logistics practices, it is important to discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of selling through FBM.
Advantages of FBM


FBM sellers can earn more income.



27% of FBM sellers earn more than $25,000 per month in income as compared to 24% of
FBA sellers.



22% of FBM sellers have profit margins of 25% or more besides 20% of FBA sellers.



FBM sellers use less money to start their business.



FBM sellers are more concerned about competition.



FBM sellers have standby plans as compared to FBA sellers.



During Holidays, FBA sellers continue receiving the supplies and continue shipping to
their customers.

33

Imran Yousaf



In extraordinary situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has imposed shipping
restrictions on non-essential products. However, FBM sellers can continue shipping their
products after receiving orders through AWS.

Disadvantages of FBM


FBM sellers work harder than the FBA sellers.



FBM sellers operate the storage and shipping on their own.



23% of FBM sellers devote 40+ hours weekly as compared to 18% of FBA sellers.



At the beginning of FBM operations, the FBM sellers bear more costs than FBA sellers.



FBM sellers maintain the costs and benefits analysis of each order regarding storage and
shipping. On the contrary, Amazon takes care of each process on behalf of FBA sellers.

Note: Data is retrieved from Jungle Scout’s 2020 State of the Amazon Seller Report.
To conclude this comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of FBM versus FBA, below are
some scenarios why FBM suits to Salt Gems more than FBA. Himalayan salt products are
oversized and overweight than normal products that require special handling. Hence, always give
more advantage by shipping them by our own instead of Amazon through FBA. Himalayan salt
products are handmade products, always best to fulfill these products via FBM by ensuring that
the product arrives the way the Salt Gems envisioned. However, some discontinued or slowmoving products are better to be sold through FBA. Shipping large and uncommon products on
their own, Salt Gems can always present it to the customer the way they want them to present. For
example, on the occasions of Boxing Day or Christmas, packaging can be easily customized. There
are also some scenarios. Salt Gems is unsure that which method of fulfillment will cost less,
Amazon FBA calculator used to compare that cost and take decisions accordingly.
With drop shipping, drop shippers can only ship the products through FBM since products are
being shipped directly from the Salt Gems’ Warehouse. Salt Gems has an existing merchant
fulfilled network in place, which can easily fulfill the needs of drop shippers. That is one reason
the network of repeated drop shippers at Salt Gems is increasing.

4.1 Salt Gems: Logistics Practices
There are some best practices adopted by Salt Gems over three years of FBM operations.
Tracking Information
Amazon customers always require tracking information to locate where the ordered products are
at the moment and when they will receive their products. With FBA, shipping and Amazon will
provide tracking information. With FBM, if Salt Gems purchases shipping through Amazon it will
then automatically generate the tracking information for the customers at the time of purchase. If
the shipping will be arranged by Salt Gems, it will provide the tracking information to the
customers by Salt Gems.
Delivery Time
Amazon always ensures that the customers receive products on time, sold from any of its channels.
After confirmation of the order, it is essential to pick the product and ship it on time. If a product
sells with a prime shipping option, it has to reach to the customer on a guaranteed date. Salt Gems
estimates and controls the shipping time after the generation of a Delivery Note.
Return instructions
Salt Gems ensures that the return instructions are mentioned on every package along with a valid
return address. With FBM, it is necessary to handle the sales returns as a mandatory policy of
Amazon. If a customer asks for a return, the seller has to accept it. Salt Gems ensures to provide a
rapid response to the customer and it must follow Amazon’s return policies.
Customer Service
Amazon manages customer service complaints on behalf of the FBA sellers. However, with FBM,
Salt Gems has to respond to customer service claims. It is mandatory to admit the sales returns and
manages the customers’ feedback. In case of non-compliance, Amazon imposes strict penalties on
the FBM sellers.
Obey Drop Shipping policy of Amazon
This year, the prime target of Salt Gems is to boost sales from the drop shipping channels. Amazon
drop shipping policies allow the sellers to fulfill orders to their customers on behalf of another

35

Imran Yousaf

seller who is offering FBM services. Salt Gems also offers drop shipping services to the clients
and ensures shipping on the behalf of these drop shippers. Amazon ensures strict control over drop
shipping policies. Salt Gems is complying with the Amazon drop shipping policies:


Identify Salt Gems as a supplier of the products on packing slips, outward packaging, and
invoices.



It is mandatory to keep information about the drop shippers confidential before shipping
orders. Salt Gems ensures this practice to every order.



Salt Gems is responsible for after-sales services and customer returns. In all cases, it is
mandatory to comply with Amazon policies.

4.2 Salt Gems: Logistics Developments in Pipe Line
Multiple carriers
Currently, Salt Gems’ operations are limited to the USA only, where it is achieving satisfactory
sales numbers. There is positive growth every year as shown in sales activity reports. Zhang et al.
(2019) stated that the e-commerce flow is dependent on the support of successful logistics
operations. Salt Gems follows this effectively by focusing more on FBM instead of FBA. The
FBM model is all about finding new and effective ways of shipping. Primarily, Salt Gems operates
through FedEx, which provides corporate rates 15% to 25% less than their standard rates. In the
USA market, there are several shipping carriers like USPS, DHL, FedEx, UPS, the U.S. Postal
Service, and many more. Salt Gems is planning to negotiate with all these top carriers. All these
carriers have different pricing plans based on the seller's capacity. The more we ship, the less our
rate would be. Hence, that is one of the reasons, Salt Gems has focused more on FedEx in recent
years.
Salt Gems also learned that shipping records are a big tool to influence multiple shipping carriers
to offer lower rates. For instance, Salt Gems conducts a healthy business with FedEx. The FedEx
shipping records are a negotiation tool with other shipping carriers to bargain lower rates. The
agents from different shipping carriers can be contacted with one email or a phone call. This
strategy is at the top of the list of Salt Gems’ logistic developments this year. This particular aspect

36

Imran Yousaf

has been highlighted by Ramanathan et al. (2014), Masmoudi et al. (2014), and Bask et al. (2012),
to use multiple ways for decreasing distribution costs to stay strong in the competition and to meet
a high number of sales in this fierce competition. Some of the following strategies would also
highlight the different ways of minimizing shipping costs to maximize profit margins.
Enticing customers for purchasing more units
Recently, Salt Gems sold bulk quantities of animal salt licks to one of the cattle farms in Louisiana.
Sending a hundred of units to one destination lowers the shipping cost significantly. Normally, it
is the cost of sending twenty-five to thirty units to multiple destinations. At the shipping cost of
twenty-five units, if a company sends a hundred units, that saves the shipping cost of sixty to
seventy units. This scenario makes Salt Gems immediately introduce the bundle sales on Amazon.
For instance, units slab of ten to a hundred units with different incentives for low-priced products
like Animal Salt Licks and Candleholders. The Salt Gems has already applied this slab policy and
onwards it will be regular sales policy of Salt Gems on both of its channels.
Using shipping account numbers for replenishment
Salt Gems will be using the FedEx shipping account number for their supplies and replenishment
in the future. Salt Gems receives inventory from five different suppliers, including four from China
for cables, bulbs and different packaging, and one main supplier for Himalayan Salt finished
products from Pakistan. The author is planning to encourage his suppliers to ship products on Salt
Gems FedEx account number. It will not only increase Salt Gems' shipping volume on the same
shipping account, it will also increase the bargaining power to negotiate in the future.
Unfortunately, it has not been the practice of Salt Gems in the recent past, but that is how we learn
new things every day in the e-commerce business. Newcomers should follow this practice right
from the start.
Packaging provided by the carrier
In recent months, Salt Gems also learned that too much focus on their printed boxes with the
branding of “Salt Gems” can cost them too much. Some carriers are offering fewer rates if we use
their packaging, in that case, we are planning to compromise on Salt Gems branding for a few of
the customers. This strategy can save ample costs from the printing, packaging side, and the
shipping side. There are some cattle farms and ranches that are unconcerned about what packaging

37

Imran Yousaf

is being used. Their main concern is what price they are receiving. By using carriers that provide
packaging, Salt Gems can also avoid “dimensional fees”, which is applicable when box surpasses
the size guidelines set by UPS, FedEx, or other carriers. The net effect of this strategy can save
15% to 25% on the shipping and packaging costs. Salt Gems is planning to adopt this strategy for
a few of its repeated customers.
Regional carriers
Regional carriers are based in different regions of the USA. Their working area is limited to those
regions. However, they repeatedly provided the same services as FedEx or UPS but at cheaper
rates. Salt Gems is based in Texas, USA. LoneStar and Process courier services are also based in
Texas, providing the best shipping rates within a few hundred kilometers radius around Texas.
Although their delivery networks are restricted, you can always save some extra dollars for
deliveries within their specified areas. Salt Gems is planning to boost sales in the Texas area with
some special incentive policies. There are many farmhouses and ranches in the Texas area and Salt
Gems is offering incentives to them by contacting them directly and sending them promotional
emails. In some cases, sending from Texas to a few far-flung areas, the U.S. Postal Service
provides cheaper rates than other carriers. The money saved from shipping costs can easily be
added to the sales offerings.
Prepaid shipping
Prepaid shipping is a strategy that has been neglected intentionally by Salt Gems in the past due to
limited cash flows. In 2020, it is going to be a clear choice for Salt Gems to invest in this operation
to acquire up to 20% savings. Salt Gems would buy a handsome quantity of shipping labels in
advance and use them for their regular deliveries. Prepaid shipping is utilized best when we have
an idea in advance that we will be repeatedly sending the same weight packages. Salt Gems will
be taking advantage of this in the future for some of its fast-moving products.
Charge special shipping fees to the customer
Many carriers include special charges like fuel surcharges, weekend deliveries, etc., if the customer
needs his ordered product earlier than the promised time or for some special occasion. Salt Gems
will also add that additional cost, which has somehow been neglected in the past due to a lack of

38

Imran Yousaf

consideration. Even a few orders like these can make a bigger impact. Salt Gems will make sure
to include all these extra costs in the customer invoice.
Hybrid shipping services
Hybrid shipping services will be one of the major inclusions for Salt Gems this year 2020. FedEx
is offering a hybrid shipping service “SmartPost” to Salt Gems. Hybrid shipping service charges
are almost half of the standard shipping charges. It works as they pick packages from the
warehouse and ship them to the local post office nearest to the destination, and then the local post
office will make the last delivery to the home or the corporate address. The cost of this delivery is
less, however, it takes longer than usual. Salt Gems is planning to merge these services. As a test
run, the fast-moving products will be considered for Hybrid shipping by adjusting their delivery
times in product listing. UPS is also offering hybrid services with the name of SurePost, Salt Gems
would compare both and select the best suited.
Association discounts
One of the intentions of Salt Gems is to become a part of professional associations, which promote
a particular category of products. They engage in partnership with different shipping carriers. They
offer their members subsidiary discounts on shipping and other product-related activities. The
Himalayan Salt products are handmade and fall into the category of Arts and Crafts products.
National Craft Association of the USA promotes imported crafts in the USA market. Salt Gems is
planning to become a member of the National Craft Association to be eligible for different benefits.
In the second stage, Salt Gems would also look to become a member of the Association for
Creative Industries (AFCI) offering lucrative incentives for handmade crafts.

Discussion and Conclusion

5.1 Summary
The case study of Salt Gems elaborates on the different aspects related to an e-commerce business.
The study briefly talks about the entrepreneurial thinking process before starting a new business,
idea generation, business commencement, and development of entrepreneurial thinking.
Moreover, it highlights the best practices of running a web store on Amazon, FBA operations, or
FBM operations, advantages, and disadvantages of doing FBM business with Amazon. The study
also suggests the best logistics practices for ongoing business and some practical developments in
the field of e-commerce logistics. This study presents the Business Model Canvas of Salt Gems,
along with sales activity reports of the last three years to offer a clear picture to the readers.
Moreover, it is helpful for those who are conducting an online business and facing some
complications in logistics operations. There are some valuable logistics strategies and managerial
suggestions that are helpful for any online seller to cut shipping costs and increase profitability.

5.2 Discussions
In this chapter, the author attempts to provide answers to the research questions of this thesis.
Before proceeding further, an important scenario will be discussed in the contemporary situation
of Covid-19, which has taught new lessons for conducting e-commerce business. This is a learning
opportunity not only for experienced e-commerce sellers but also for beginners and for those who
are planning to conduct e-commerce business. The e-commerce businessmen never considered
these scenarios before this pandemic occurred. Recently, Amazon announced a freeze for many of
its operations due to lockdown situations all around the USA. Amazon has clearly said no to
receive non-essential inventory. They are accepting only these categories: Baby, Health &
Household, Beauty & Personal Care, Grocery, Industrial & Scientific, and Pet Supplies.
Amazon has turned away inbound deliveries of all goods except the essential products. This leaves
the sellers on their own, even the already available non-essential FBA deliveries have experienced
more than thirty days. Amazon has hired more than one hundred thousand temporary workers.
However, they are unable to handle the situation as the virus has hit their workers in thirteen of
their warehouses in the USA. As per Amazon, some FBA sellers will lose several months’ revenue
due to this pandemic and extraordinary situation. Fortunately, Salt Gems was ready for these kinds
of circumstances. Nowadays, apart from some shipping complications, Salt Gems, along with

40

Imran Yousaf

other FBM sellers can sell any products they want as they have products available in their
warehouses. In this situation, FBA sellers and other online sellers have to think outside of the box.
They will have to adjust their business models for the sake of their survival in their online
businesses:


Converting FBA listings into FBM; it will ensure that items can persist in the stocks so
that they can be replenished at FBA when the restrictions are lifted.



This pandemic duration is unpredictable, so relying completely on FBA can put the
business at risk. Expanding FBA operations with a combination of internal
warehousing and outsourced shipping carriers can introduce reasonable business
options.



Shipping delays are possibly devastating if a business is completely relying on
Amazon. This Covid-19 pandemic is a chance to outsource storage, outsource shipping,
and enhance sales from your e-commerce site.



It is the wrong time to cut the advertising and promotion budget. However, any business
can control it according to the situation. At the same time, online businesses are
expanding because customers are relying too much on online deliveries.



Since Amazon is not accepting non-essential products, some sellers are adding essential
items to their businesses where possible.



The Covid-19 is also an opportunity to review the fulfillment strategy to offer the
flexibility to manipulate fulfillment place, storage, and shipping options.

5.3 Conclusion
Research questions
1- What are the beneficial logistics strategies, online sellers/retailers should adopt?
2- How can Salt Gems increase profitability by improving logistics operations?
The case study of Salt Gems aims to discuss overall improvements in logistics operations for any
online seller as well as Salt Gems itself. The study of Salt Gems, an ongoing online business,
highlighted the importance of logistics operations and never-ending developments for this matter.
Furthermore, the current logistics practices of Salt Gems have been discussed along with future
logistics developments. The study has described the solutions to minimize the logistics and
distribution costs to increase profits.
41

Imran Yousaf

Many authors have shown different logistics problems and their solutions in the B2C type of ecommerce business in the literature. However, the author of this study discussed the practical
logistics problems and their solutions based on personal experience of conducting an online
business both on Amazon and their e-commerce web. The association between the problems and
strategies perhaps has yet to be developed in-depth. However, the author has shared some practical
logistics solutions that have been effectively applied for over three years.
The literature has surely discussed the favorable logistics operations of an online business.
Furthermore, the author also highlighted the current logistics practices of Salt Gems, which have
provided at least two strengths. First, they are general and already in use, and can be adopted by
all online sellers. The structure allows several industries and different business models to be
considered. Second, all the practices and future developments are based on significant empirical
evidence discussed in the literature. There are at least three vital managerial suggestions that can
be derived from this study. Firstly, it shows that the logistics strategy is always dependent on the
exact logistics problem, which has to be fully investigated by the merchant regarding the service
level and features of the products. Almost all kinds of current logistics issues and solutions have
been discussed which online sellers can adopt in this dynamic era of 2020. These solutions might
be helpful for them when they conduct business after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Secondly, the logistics problem is undoubtedly a major factor but that is not the only element that
can be proved as a basis for defining logistics strategy. The author has mentioned, when he started
the business through Amazon, relying only on FBA, he was achieving good sales numbers, but
was unsatisfied with overall profitability. For conducting FBA sales, there were efforts required
like product arrangements, replenishment, and product listings. For conducting FBM sales, even
more effort was required like finding a suitable warehouse, handling the products, and shipping
the products. The author decided to go for FBM at the very early stages of the business to earn
more profits. He started looking for his own warehouse instead of using Amazon’s warehouse. He
signed contracts with different shipping carriers to save every penny where possible, and that has
become the basis for defining the overall logistics strategy for Salt Gems.
Every day is a challenging day for an e-commerce business. An e-commerce business requires
continuous improvements in all aspects, especially in the logistics strategy. In the case of Salt
Gems, all the future developments in the pipeline are key examples of the swift distribution

42

Imran Yousaf

strategy. If an online seller kept improving himself, even the scenarios like the COVID-19, would
not be disturbing much as compared to many others left clueless at the moment.
Thirdly, the author's experience offers ways to decide the right time to conduct FBA operations,
as well as, the right time to conduct FBM operations. An online seller should have complete control
of both. Even today, Salt Gems is conducting business with a combination of FBA and FBM
operations. Although, selling through FBA is less profitable, it offers quick sales for the slowmoving products. The Amazon algorithm works best in this situation of FBA. The highly
demanded products can be sold through FBM to ensure handsome profits.
Apart from Amazon shipping restrictions on the non-essential products, if online sellers have
already established a parallel platform for storing and shipping non-essential products, they can
continue with the uninterrupted sales. Salts Gems has shared the details of its current logistics
practices, future development of logistics operations, and financial numbers of FBA and FBM
sales on Amazon. These details might be helpful to some readers who are conducting or planning
to conduct e-commerce business.

5.4 Limitations
The case study also has some limitations. It cannot offer the particular choice of operations. For
instance, warehouse location, its dimensions, types of product handling equipment, and choice of
the particular shipping carrier. Of course, businesses with different types of products with different
types of stages need different workable solutions.
There is also a limitation that logistics practices and planned developments are particularly
discussed only in the USA business environment. There might be positive or negative correlations
about key findings and suggestions in some other parts of the world.
