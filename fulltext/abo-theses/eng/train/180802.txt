Abstract
The recent trend in switching from fossil to renewable sources in the production of
essential chemicals has revealed novel methods within the concept of green chemistry.
This work focuses on the epoxidation of oleic acid with a chemo-enzymatic approach
using immobilized lipase as catalyst. Different hydrogen peroxide versus fatty acid
ratios, temperatures and stirring rates were evaluated. Acoustic irradiation was
implemented for reaction intensification and different ultrasound amplitudes were
studied.
The experimental results show that almost complete conversions of the double bonds
in oleic acid are achievable in an isothermal batch reactor, with low concentrations of
ring-opening byproducts produced. Ultrasound irradiation is used for enhancing the
reaction rate, reaching high conversions in four hours of reaction time. Novozym®
435 reveals to be a working and durable catalyst for fatty acid epoxidation. The catalyst
preserves its activity and selectivity well, which was confirmed by catalyst recovery
experiments conducted both in a conventional batch reactor and in a sonochemical
reactor in the presence of ultrasound. However, SEM images revealed that the
cavitation caused by ultrasound has an impact on the catalyst morphology.
Different mathematical models for the reaction kinetics were developed and evaluated
by parameter estimation using non-linear regression analysis. Statistical data for the
mechanisms were evaluated and the best performing model was chosen with the
chemical knowledge in mind. All the models and their estimated parameter values
showed a good fit to the experimental data.

1. Introduction
The world is currently facing a megatrend of climate change, bringing us a variety of
challenges in developing novel sustainable solutions. The need for switching from
fossil-based raw materials to renewables has led to discovering new techniques for
producing the demanded products in the world. Non-edible plant oils are an option for
the production of epoxidized oils, used as chemical intermediates for production of
important products as biolubricants [1], plasticizers [2], biobased rigid foams [3], nonisocyanate polyurethanes [4], among others.
The market for oleochemical fatty acids and their derivatives has been growing in
recent years, and the growth is projected to continue during the next few years [5]. The
source of vegetable fatty acids can be e.g. soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, linseed,
and cottonseed [6]. In Northern Europe, Tall Oil Fatty Acids (TOFA) are a large and
sustainable source of fatty acids. Tall oil is mainly obtained as a side product in pulping
of softwood, such as pine and spruce, but also from hardwood such as birch [7], [8].
Current major players in the valorization of tall oil are Forchem, UPM Biofuels, Sun
Pine and Kraton Chemical. Major investments in the field of Crude Tall Oil (CTO)
refining are recently announced by Fintoil in Finland and Mainstream Pine Products
in USA.
This study focuses on the chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids
originated from renewable, plant-based resources. Oleic acid as a model molecule for
fatty acids is used as feedstock for the epoxidation in this study. Moreover, in previous
studies they have used other fatty acids and raw vegetable oils for the chemoenzymatic epoxidation, such as tall oil [9], linoleic acid [10], soybean oil [11]–[13],
sunflower oil [14], linseed oil [15], among others. The epoxidation reaction is
catalyzed by the immobilized lipase Candida Antarctica lipase B on an acrylic resin
support (Novozym® 435), meaning that the reaction can be carried out in mild reaction
conditions with no need of an additional carboxylic acid in the reaction mixture. In
this chemo-enzymatic epoxidation, only the fatty acid, an oxidant and immobilized
lipase are needed for transforming the double bond of the fatty acid into an epoxy
group [16].

1.1. Epoxidation of vegetable oils
1.1.1. Prileschajew epoxidation
Epoxidized vegetable oils have a great potential to replace traditional fossil-based
products since they are biodegradable, renewable, and non-toxic options. For the time
being, the most common method used in industrial scale for producing epoxidized
vegetable oil is the Prileschajew epoxidation. This method comprises a reaction
between the unsaturated fatty acid and a peroxy acid, the latter being generated in situ
in a homogenous system with a carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
peroxide supports the perhydrolysis of carboxylic acid in the aqueous phase, forming
the percarboxylic acid for the Prileschajew epoxidation between the double bond in
fatty acid and the peroxy acid in the organic phase [17]–[19]. The reaction mechanism
is described in Figure 1.

Introduction

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Traditionally, strong inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid and hydrogen chloride have
been used for an effective in situ generation of peroxy acids [20]. Subsequent studies
have led to using weaker carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, as well as strong acid
heterogeneous catalysts. These methods lead to a more environmentally friendly
technology for the perhydrolysis step in fatty acid epoxidation. Using different kinds
of acidic ion-exchange catalysts for promoting the perhydrolysis reaction in the
Prileschajew epoxidation has been studied and is beneficial compared to using a pure
homogenous acidic system [21], [22]. Despite being both an economical and
environmentally friendly method, the epoxides produced by this Prileschajew
epoxidation method are sensitive to ring-opening by nucleophiles present in the system
and, therefore, the selectivity is limited [23].

1.1.2. Chemo-enzymatic epoxidation
The recent trend has switched the focus towards an enzymatic approach to epoxidation
thanks to its possibilities to work in mild reaction environments by forming peroxy
acids in situ directly from fatty acids with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. The
concept of converting carboxylic acids and hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding
peroxy acid assisted by immobilized lipases was introduced by Björkling et al. [24].
This was followed by Warwel and Rüsch gen. Klaas when they presented the concept
of an in situ chemo-enzymatic ‘self’-epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, using
hydrogen peroxide and catalyzed by an immobilized lipase Candida Antarctica lipase
B (Novozym® 435) [16], [25]. In this process, the fatty acid undergoes first a
perhydrolysis step, forming together with hydrogen peroxide and lipase the needed
peroxy acids. The fatty acid reacts with the peroxy acid and forms an epoxide and a
fatty acid as product, supporting on the mechanism of Prileschajew epoxidation. This
method consists of a liquid-liquid-solid system with hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous
phase and the organic phase consisting of vegetable oil [11]. Figure 2 shows the
reaction scheme of the described reaction steps for the chemo-enzymatic ‘self’epoxidation.

Figure 2 – The reaction scheme of chemo-enzymatic ‘self’-epoxidation of oleic acid

A scenario of peroleic acid functioning as a nucleophile for another peroleic acid, thus
creating an epoxidized peroleic acid as a byproduct, is worth considering in the
reaction mechanism. However, due to small concentrations of peroleic acid in the
reaction system, the volume of epoxidized peroleic acid produced is presumably
smaller compared to epoxidized oleic acid [26].
Compared to chemical epoxidation, this chemo-enzymatic method is advantageous
thanks to its low temperature conditions, higher selectivity and conversion rates [9].
The lipase has been shown to be reusable in several consecutive experiments using
this method [12], [16], being an important part of making this method economically
viable. Additionally, compared to the conventional Prileschajew method, this chemoenzymatic epoxidation forms a low amount of undesired ring-opened byproducts,
making this method highly selective [16].

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The reaction temperature is usually a key factor for increasing reaction rates and
conversions. It has been reported that the activity of immobilized lipase is impacted in
temperatures exceeding 60 °C in an environment containing hydrogen peroxide and
water. However, the activity is well preserved in systems without hydrogen peroxide
and only water in the same temperature. This means that high concentrations of
hydrogen peroxide in temperatures of 60 °C or above can have a significant damaging
impact on lipase, thus leading to inefficiency [27].
In multiple studies, toluene is added as a nonpolar solvent to preserve the high levels
of activity in the enzyme, protecting it from making contact with the hydrogen
peroxide. This leads to an eventual increase in yield and keeps the catalyst reusable for
multiple experiments [11], [12]. The use of solvents in the epoxidation reaction should,
however, be carefully evaluated with the concept of green chemistry in mind [28]. The
recent research studies have shown promising results for a solvent-free chemoenzymatic epoxidation, making the process more environmentally friendly and less
harmful for human health [13], [29]. The solvent polarity is, however, a governing
factor for keeping the lipase activity. Water, which tends to suppress the catalytic
activity, acts as a natural solvent for lipase. Therefore, the amount of water should not
reach too high levels in order to preserve the efficiency of the catalyst [30].

1.2. Process intensification in epoxidation of fatty acids
The progression towards greener and safer solutions for producing chemicals has
introduced a concept called process intensification to the list of novel technologies.
Different forms of reaction intensification methods can be used, e.g. more efficient
mixing and novel heating technologies. Applying an alternative form of energy to the
reaction system can lead to cleaner, smaller, safer and more energy-efficient solutions
for maximizing the yields [31]. Recent studies have shown favorable results for
epoxidation using a combination of microwave irradiation and new forms of stirring
devices, called Rotating Bed Reactors, in the epoxidation of fatty acids [32].

1.2.1. Rotating Bed Technology
When working with liquid-liquid systems where the reaction takes place in an
emulsion, increasing the efficiency of the mass transfer between the two phases is key.
A rotating bed reactor Spinchem® RBR is used in this study, where the packed catalyst
bed is placed inside the stirring element, which aims to minimize the mass transfer
limitations with a centrifugal liquid flow through the catalyst bed. The recovery of a
solid catalyst from a liquid medium after the reaction can be a cumbersome procedure.
By using the RBR technology, the catalyst is immobilized in the device, hence the
separation process is made simpler without a need for filtration [21], [33], [34]. Figure
3 shows a schematic picture of the structure of the Spinchem® RBR device.

1.2.2. Ultrasound irradiation
Ultrasound technology combined with conventional heating is an available option in
the field of process intensification. Frequencies from 20 kHz to 10 MHz can be used
in the ultrasound sonic spectrum. In contrast to using microwaves as a process
intensification method, the ultrasound requires a physical medium for its application.
Ultrasound in chemical reactions, also called sonochemistry, has its benefits in the
form of cavitation caused by the ultrasonic waves. Small cavitation bubbles are
created, growing in several cycles of compression and expansion until they eventually
collapse rapidly. Consequently, high pressure and temperature peaks are generated
locally with overall ambient conditions in the reactor. Free radicals can be formed in
this collapse of the bubble, potentially leading to an increase in conversion in
ultrasound suitable reactions [12], [31], [35]–[37]. Figure 4 shows a schematic
overview of the cavitation phenomenon.

Figure 4 - A schematic overview of the cavitation phenomenon [36]

In liquid-liquid systems, ultrasound creates very fine emulsions causing an increase of
the total reaction area between phases. This phenomenon is beneficial for increasing
the mass transfer in the process. Furthermore, ultrasound potentially has an impact on
the reaction kinetics by increasing the reaction rates [36]–[38]. The application of
ultrasounds in lipase-catalyzed systems has previously shown to increase the
efficiency of the enzymatic reaction without a significant decrease in the catalyst

stability. Also, morphological and structural changes of lipase can be caused by
ultrasonic irradiation, leading to an increase in the surface area of the catalyst.
Additionally, it has previously been shown that ultrasound has a beneficial effect on
lipase activity when using ionic liquids as solvents, although, the stability is somewhat
lower [30], [39], [40].

1.3. Scope
The purpose of this work was to study the chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of fatty acids
with an immobilized lipase catalyst (Novozym® 435) in a batch reactor system. Oleic
acid was used as a model molecule for fatty acids and the initial molar ratios of
hydrogen peroxide versus fatty acid were optimized. Ultrasound as a process
intensification method was introduced and studied further. The work consisted of the
following tasks:

-

Optimization of the molar ratio of unsaturated fatty acid to hydrogen peroxide
in silent mode at different reaction times

-

Introduction to sonochemical reactors using ultrasound irradiation, comparing
different ultrasound amplitudes and their impact on the reaction rate and
reactant conversion

-

Investigation on the influence of the temperature and the stirring speed in the
chemo-enzymatic epoxidation conducted under ultrasound irradiation

-

Study of the possibilities for reusing the catalyst in several consecutive
experiments in both conventional and sonochemical reactor environments

-

Development of a mathematical model for the reaction in a conventional
reactor environment, including simulation and parameter estimation for the
description of the reaction kinetics

2.2. Experimental setup
2.2.1. Reactor setup
All experiments were performed in a 250 ml isothermal batch glass reactor vessel
surrounded by a thermostatic jacket (Lenz®). The jacket was filled with a mixture of
ethylene glycol which was heated by a circulation bath assisted by a conventional heat
exchanger. The reactor was equipped with a reflux condenser for preventing the
evaporation of the volatile compounds in the reaction mixture during the reaction
process.
The formation of an emulsion during the reaction was made by stirring with a rotating
bed reactor system (SpinChem® RBR) placed inside the reactor vessel (Figure 5). The
RBR consisted of four rotating catalyst bed chambers, where the solid catalyst could
be placed, which enabled the use of immobilized solid catalyst without any need of
separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture. In this setup, the reaction system
undergoes a centrifugal effect, pushing the inner parts of the mixture to the outer parts
of the reactor [33]. The SpinChem® device was used with the catalyst inside and
outside the chambers. The ultrasound experiments were conducted with an ultrasound
horn (microtip, Fischerbrand®) inserted in the glass reactor. Different amplitudes of
the ultrasound microtip, 30%, 60% and 90%, with a frequency of 20 kHz were used
during the experiments. The temperature was continuously recorded during the
experiments by the software Picolog® connected to a thermocouple that was protected
by Teflon and inserted in the reactor. A 10 ml syringe was used for withdrawing
samples. Images of the reactor equipment can be found in Appendix I.

2.2.2. Experimental matrix
The experiments were performed in seven different experimental sets, three sets
conducted in the absence of ultrasound and four sets with ultrasound. To obtain an
understanding of the optimal molar ratio of unsaturated fatty acid versus hydrogen
peroxide, the epoxidation process was at first optimized under silent conditions
without using ultrasound as process intensification method. With the optimal oleic acid
to hydrogen peroxide ratio determined in silent mode with the first seven experiments,
the same conditions were used in experiments assisted with ultrasound. In the
experimental sets with ultrasound, the amplitude of ultrasound, temperature and
stirring rate was adjusted to find maximal conversions and reaction rates. The
experiments and their reaction conditions are listed in Table 2.

2.2.3. Experimental procedure
All the experiments were performed in batch mode. The oleic acid, lipase (Novozym
435), hydrogen peroxide and water were measured up in separate Erlenmeyer flasks
or glass beakers covered with paraffin film. For the experiments where the
SpinChem® was used as a rotating catalyst bed, the catalyst was distributed evenly in
the four different chambers and the lipase filled device was placed in the reactor before
adding any reactants. In the other cases, the catalyst was weighed in a beaker with the
same procedure as the reactants and the SpinChem® was inserted empty, working only
as a stirrer.
Oleic acid, water and lipase were added into the reactor and the stirring device was
switched on with the desired speed to create the emulsion. After the reactor reached
the desired temperature of the experiment, hydrogen peroxide was added dropwise
during about one-minute time, in order to prevent both an impact on the stability of
lipase and an undesired rapid exothermic reaction, where a temperature peak is created.
The time-point when hydrogen peroxide was added into the mixture was considered
as the start of the reaction. When conducting an ultrasound experiment, the ultrasound
horn was turned on after all the reagents were added and the operating cycle of the
device was 1 minute ON and 1 minute OFF throughout the experiment.
After the reaction was stopped, the stirring was shut down and the emulsion was left
for 10 minutes to spontaneously separate in two phases. The aqueous phase was
carefully withdrawn from the reactor through a drain, and toluene was added to the
remaining organic phase in order to handle it more easily. The catalyst was recovered
by a vacuum filter and further washed with toluene to clean possible remaining
products on the enzyme. After air drying the catalyst in a fume hood for 12 hours, it
was used for the next reaction when the reusability of the lipase was studied.

2.3. Analytical procedures and methods
The sampling was done mainly every hour except for the 8-hour and 12-hour
experiments where also two-hour intervals were used in the later part of the reaction.
The samples with a volume of 5 ml were withdrawn with a syringe through a Teflon®coated sampling tube. The sample was left in the sampling syringe for a few minutes
to separate in two phases before placing in two sample bottles for analysis: one bottle
for the aqueous phase and one for the organic phase. Both bottles were placed in a
centrifuge for two minutes, in order to separate the solid catalyst particles from the
samples. The aqueous phase was analyzed immediately to prevent any decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide. The organic phase was transferred to an oven at 60 ˚C, ensuring
a homogeneous sample and preventing any solidification. Two different analyses were
carried out for the organic phase, one directly after sampling, another after being stored
12-72 hours in the freezer. Images of the titrimetric analysis equipment is found in
Appendix I.

2.3.1. Aqueous phase analysis – Hydrogen peroxide content
The aqueous phase samples were analyzed within 30 minutes after withdrawal. The
concentration of hydrogen peroxide was analyzed by the Greenspan and MacKellar
method [41]. This was done by measuring 0.1 g of sample in an Erlenmeyer flask,
diluted in 50 ml of 10% sulfuric acid and adding three drops of ferroin indicator. Then
1-2 ice cubes were added in the flask to decrease the temperature below 10 ˚C for the
titration of the solution with ammonium cerium sulfate. The solution was titrated under
stirring from orange color to transparent. The amount of hydrogen peroxide in the
aqueous phase was calculated as follows:

2.3.2. Organic phase analysis – Iodine value
The iodine value describes the number of double bonds in a sample, expressed as
grams of iodine reacted in 100 g of oil. The analysis was conducted by applying the
Hanus method [42]. For this analysis, 0.1 g of organic phase was measured up in an
Erlenmeyer flask, dissolved in 20 ml of chloroform and 20 ml of Hanus solution
(iodine bromide in acetic acid). The flask was left for one hour in a dark place for the
iodine to completely react with the double bonds in the sample. After one hour, 20 ml
of 10% potassium iodide solution were added to let the remaining iodine bromide
react, and 100 ml of water was added to clean the walls of the flask. A small amount
of starch indicator was added, and the whole mixture was titrated under stirring with a
0.1 M sodium thiosulphate solution until the solution turned transparent. The volume
of titrator solution spent for analyzing the sample was used for calculating the iodine
value:
𝐼𝑉 =

[ ]𝑁𝑎2 𝑆2 𝑂3 ∗(𝑉𝐵𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑘 −𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 )∗𝑀𝑀𝐼 ∗100
𝑚𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒

(2)

This can be transformed into relative conversion of double bonds (RCU) as follows:
𝐼𝑉0 −𝐼𝑉𝑒𝑥
) ∗ 100
𝐼𝑉0

%𝑅𝐶𝑈 = 100 − (

(3)

where 𝐼𝑉0 is the initial iodine value of the organic sample and 𝐼𝑉𝑒𝑥 the iodine value for
the particular experiment.

2.3.3. Organic phase analysis – Oxirane number
Jay’s method was used to determine the amount of oxirane groups (epoxy groups) in
the organic phase [43]. In the analysis, 0.1 g of organic phase sample were dissolved
in 10 ml of chloroform and 10 ml of 20 wt% tetraethyl ammonium chloride (TEAB)
dissolved in acetic acid. The mixture was titrated with 0.1 M perchloric acid in acetic
acid using an automatic potentiometric titrator (799 GPT Titrino, Metrohm, recorded
with the software tiamo™). The conversion to epoxy groups can be expressed as the
relative conversion to oxirane (RCO) calculated from,
𝑂𝑂

where 𝑂𝑂𝑒𝑥 is the experimentally determined content of oxirane oxygen, and 𝑂𝑂𝑡ℎ the

where 𝑀𝑀𝑖 is the atomic mass of iodine, and 𝑀𝑀𝑂 the atomic mass of oxygen.

2.3.4. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
For the analysis of products in the organic phase, a Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer
operating at 500.10 MHz (1H) equipped with a BB/1H SmartProbe was used. All
samples were dissolved in deuterated methanol-d4 and the spectra were recorded at 25
°C.

2.3.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used for studying the morphology of the
catalyst, with a particular focus on the cavitational effects of ultrasound on the catalyst
material. The equipment used was of model Zeiss Leo Gemini 1530. The images were
taken at 30x, 100x, 250x and 1000x.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. SpinChem® Rotating Bed Reactor
All experiments except one were conducted by adding the catalyst to the reaction
mixture. Using the SpinChem® RBR as a rotating catalyst bed device turned out to be
insufficient due to accessibility problems, hypothetically caused by the high viscosity
of oleic acid and the relatively high amount of immobilized lipase packed in the device.
As shown in Figure 6, parts of the catalyst bed remained dry and consequently the
efficiency of the enzymatic catalysis in this system was strongly suppressed.
Regardless of this, the SpinChem® RBR showed to be an efficient stirrer when the
catalyst was added directly in the mixture. One hypothesis for the good efficiency is
that the immobilized lipase is preserved better when using SpinChem® RBR as a
stirrer instead of traditional agitators, that can have a grinding effect on the catalyst
[34].

3.2. Determination of optimal reaction parameters
3.2.1. Influence of hydrogen peroxide
The influence of different hydrogen peroxide molar ratio versus unsaturated fatty acid
ratio was studied extensively. Molar ratios (oleic acid to hydrogen peroxide, later
OA:HP) of 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:1.75 and 1:2 were studied. All the experiments in this section
were conducted with a hydrogen peroxide solution of 30% w/v without the assistance
of ultrasound. A catalyst load of 7% w/w with respect to the oleic acid mass was used
at 50 ˚C, 1000 rpm with the SpinChem® RBR. The durations of the experiments were
6 and 12 hours.

Figure 7 and Figure 8 show that the highest conversions to epoxide were reached more
rapidly with higher ratios of hydrogen peroxide, the RCO of 81 % was reached after 4
hours in the experiment with OA:HP 1:2 ratio. A consistent decrease in the reaction
rate can be seen with the experiments closer to equimolar levels of hydrogen peroxide
versus unsaturated fatty acid. However, by comparing Figure 9 with Figure 7, a ratio
of OA:HP 1:1.5 reached slightly higher levels of epoxide after 8 hours with equivalent
reaction conditions. A remarkable fact is also that even at the lowest OA:HP ratio, 1:1,
the reaction rate is on steady levels still after 6 hours (Figure 7), meaning that higher
yields are possible to reach by increasing the reaction time. Considering both economic
and environmental aspects, optimizing the process with a lower amount of hydrogen
peroxide is a good consideration since feasible levels of epoxide yield can still be
reached.

For the Prileschajew epoxidation method used in industrial-scale processes, sidereactions in the form of ring-opening are observed [8], [21], [23]. In this work, using
a chemo-enzymatic epoxidation method, there is a quantitative difference between the
measured values of epoxy groups and the converted double bonds in the fatty acid.
This indicates the formation of ring-opening products (Figure 9). The presence of ringopening products was further studied with NMR analyses, which are discussed in

Törnvall et al. reported that high amounts of hydrogen peroxide in temperatures above
20 ˚C impair the activity of lipase, hence lower conversions are obtained [27].
However, in this work, no major decrease of the catalyst activity was detected when
higher ratios of hydrogen peroxide were used. Since a relatively low concentration of
30 % w/w hydrogen peroxide solution was used in all the experiments, the catalyst
activity might not have been influenced by hydrogen peroxide. For further
investigation on the impact of hydrogen peroxide on the lipase catalyst, higher
concentrations of hydrogen peroxide could be tested at equivalent reaction conditions.

3.2.2. Influence of ultrasound
One of the main goals for this work was to study the influence of acoustic cavitation
in the form of ultrasound irradiation. The ultrasound probe was operated at a frequency
of 20 kHz at different amplitudes of 30%, 60% and 90%, with a power output of 22
W, 28 W and 34 W, respectively. For keeping the isothermal conditions in the system,
a duty cycle of 50% was used, meaning that the ultrasound probe was switched on for
one minute, whereafter the probe was switched off for one minute. At a catalyst load
of 7 wt%, a fatty acid to hydrogen peroxide ratio of 1:2, 50 ⁰C and a stirring speed of
1000 rpm were utilized.
Four experiments with identical reaction conditions, but with varying amplitudes of
30%, 60% and 90% were conducted in this set. A reference experiment was performed
with the ultrasound probe in the reactor in the absence of ultrasound. As depicted in
Figure 10, the results show clear indications of a positive effect on the reaction rates

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

As reported by Bhalerao et al., a continuous increase in the reaction rate can be
observed by increasing the input power of ultrasounds [12]. A similar effect was
confirmed by the experiments in this study, since an amplitude of 90% resulted in the
highest RCO levels, at 84% after three hours. Considering the financial aspects in the
use of ultrasound equipment, the results of RCO 80% after three hours with 60%
amplitude can be considered as competitive as the results obtained with 90%
amplitude.
Although ultrasound is increasing the reaction rates, no major differences in eventual
conversions were observed in comparison to the experiments in silent mode.
Furthermore, the oxirane number seems to be decreasing by prolonging the reaction
time, which indicates that the concentration of ring-opening products is increasing with
time when applying ultrasound irradiation for intensifying the reaction process. Hence,
the total reaction time should be shortened to 4-5 hours to minimize the concentrations
of ring-opening products.
As previously mentioned, ultrasound irradiation promotes the formation of an
emulsion between the organic and the aqueous phase, thus contributing to an efficient
biphasic mass transfer. This was observed when withdrawing the samples, since a
spontaneous phase separation was difficult to achieve without using a centrifuge. The
observation of this phenomenon was diminished with time (Figure 11), which
indicates that the emulsion is more stable when high amounts of unreacted fatty acid
are present and not when epoxidized fatty acid is formed. This phenomenon caused
unreliability issues in the analysis of the first samples of each experiment using
ultrasound irradiation. Therefore, the iodine value, thus also the RCU value of the first
sample, was corrected to the theoretical iodine value of oleic acid.

3.2.3. Influence of temperature
The reaction temperature for the sonochemical reactor was optimized by studying four
different temperatures: 30 °C, 45 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C with a 1:2 fatty acid-to-hydrogen
peroxide ratio using 90% ultrasound amplitude and 1000 rpm. Two of these
experiments with lower temperatures (30 °C and 45 °C) were discontinued before the
estimated reaction time of 8 hours due to product solidification on the glass walls of
the reactor. This phenomenon caused severe mass transfer limitations (Figure 12), and
it was likewise experienced in experiments performed with linoleic acid [10].

Figure 12 - An image of the solidification in the discontinued experiment at 30 °C.

Figure 13 shows that the best reaction conditions were found at 60 °C, where the
highest RCO values of 86% were reached. Although 60 °C seems to be the optimal
temperature, similar levels of RCO were reached at 50 °C and this temperature can be
considered for preserving the enzymatic activity when the catalyst is being reused in
several consecutive experiments [10], [27].

3.2.4. Influence of stirring speed
Stirring speed has an impact on the emulsion formation, hence on the mass transfer
between the aqueous and organic phase. A stirring rate of 1000 rpm was chosen as the
initial speed for the experiments, thus avoiding any mass transfer limitations that using
the SpinChem® device could bring. Given the low efficiency of using SpinChem® for
immobilizing the catalyst, a variation in stirring rate was implemented, since the device
was only used as a stirrer with a centrifugal effect.
The stirring speed has to be high enough to create an emulsion and, accordingly, the
stirring speeds were set to 500 rpm, 750 rpm and 1000 rpm in order to homogenize the
liquid mixture well [19]. Previous studies have stated that a high stirring speed can
result in a destruction of the immobilized lipase and, therefore, lower conversions in
oxirane number have been obtained [11], [12]. As depicted in Figure 14 and, in
contrary to the previous statements, a high stirring speed of 1000 rpm was appropriate
for this system. One hypothesis is that the filter around the SpinChem® device is

protecting the immobilized lipase from being harmed by a grinding effect of the
agitator (See schematic figure of SpinChem® RBR, Figure 3). However, even if high
stirring rates were efficient, a lower speed seems to be more efficient for obtaining
high values of conversion. A speed of 750 rpm is the most favorable one in terms of
high conversions with a top RCO value of almost complete conversion. The results at
500 rpm and 1000 rpm led to comparably similar values in the reaction rate and
conversion. As a conclusion, the reaction parameters of OA:HP ratio of 1:2, ultrasound
amplitude of 90%, 60 °C and 750 rpm is the most favorable option of all the

3.3. Lipase reusability in conventional and sonochemical reactors
The reusability of immobilized lipase is crucial for the economic viability of this
process. The concept of catalyst recycling for this system was first practiced by
Warwel and Rüsch gen. Klaas [16] using toluene as a solvent, continued by OrellanaCoca et al. [29] in a solvent-free medium, and by Bhalerao et al. [12] with toluene as
the solvent, intensified by acoustic irradiation. The purpose of this work was to test
the reusability in a solvent-free medium both in the absence and presence of
ultrasound.
As previously mentioned, slightly lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide and a lower
temperature were used in order to preserve the activity of the catalyst. Hence, the
reaction conditions were set at 50 °C with a stirring speed of 750 rpm. The fatty acidto-hydrogen peroxide molar ratios were set to 1:1.5 for experiments conducted in the
absence of ultrasound, and to 1:1.75 for experiments in the presence of ultrasound. For
a proper view on the ultrasound impact on the catalyst activity, the full power of 90%
ultrasound amplitude was used. The catalyst was recovered after each experiment and
reused in the next experiment. In order to reach equal levels of the catalyst load, new
catalyst was added to the used one. The reusability levels for each experiment are
described in Table 3.

The experimental data in Figure 15 and Figure 16 show that, as an addition to the clear
rate enhancing effect of ultrasound, the catalyst reusability is preserved for at least
three consecutive experiments under the these reaction conditions. The ultrasound
experiments reached almost full conversion to epoxides, while the silent experiments
resulted in lower values of RCO.

3.4. Chemical composition of products – NMR analysis
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was used to analyze the chemical
composition of products obtained in silent mode, with ultrasound, and for the catalyst
reusability experiments. The analyzed experiments were the molar ratio OA:HP 1:2 in
silent mode and stirring at 1000 rpm (Table 2, experiment 8), OA:HP 1:2 with the
ultrasound amplitude 90% and stirring at 500 rpm (Table 2, experiment 15) and
OA:HP 1:1.75 with the ultrasound amplitude 90% using reused catalyst and with
stirring at 750 rpm (Table 2, experiment 22). Two samples per each experiment, one
after 4 hours and another one after 8 hours of reaction time, were analyzed. The
complete 1H spectra for all the analyzed samples can be found in Figure 17.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

One major discovery from these spectra is that after four hours of reaction time, only
for the experiment in silent mode and for the catalyst reusability experiment, some
signs of unreacted double bonds from the fatty acid can be detected. After eight hours
of reaction time, no remaining double bonds can be seen in the spectra. This implies
that the conversion for all the experiments was complete.
Small amounts of ring-opening products in the form of diols and esters can be found
in every analyzed sample, but larger peaks are found in the samples after 8 hours of
reaction time. An analysis of the NMR spectra provides a result of ester-hydroxyls to
diols ratio 1:0.4, thus, esters are the dominating ring-opening products. This means
that the carboxylic groups are mainly the nucleophiles causing the ring-opening
reactions, and not water. According to the NMR spectra, the largest amount of ringopening products was found in the sample from the silent experiment, measuring about
10% of the products.
In the Prileschajew epoxidation, the system is operating in an acidic environment due
to an addition of carboxylic acid, hence the probability for protonation of the oxirane
ring is high. According to the provided spectra in Figure 17, a lower amount of ringopening products was formed in this chemo-enzymatic epoxidation compared to a
classical Prileschajew epoxidation [8]. The reason for this might be that lower amounts
of possible nucleophiles is available in a system without carboxylic acid added, and
only water and the carboxylic group in the fatty acid can be seen as nucleophiles
leading to ring-opening of the epoxy group.
Minor peaks of a component consisting of a phenyl group attached by an alkyl chain
is discovered from the experiment using reused catalyst and ultrasound. This is
possibly caused by toluene that is used as a solvent for cleaning the catalyst before
reuse. It is, however, a very small peak of approximately 0.07% of the whole sample
concentration. It could be interesting to further study the impact of combining reused
catalyst and ultrasound irradiation by reusing the catalyst in several consecutive
experiments.

3.5. Catalyst durability – SEM analysis
The morphology of the immobilized lipase was studied with Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM). Fresh catalyst as well as reused catalyst originating from
experiments both in silent mode and ultrasound were studied. The SEM images from
a fresh catalyst (Figure 18) and a catalyst used in silent mode (Figure 19) show that
the shape of Novozym® 435 is preserved well during the experiments conducted in
silent mode. However, the catalyst lost its beauty after three consecutive uses with
ultrasound due to the cavitation phenomena, impacting the catalyst surface (Figure
20). It is remarkable that the catalyst is keeping its activity despite the destruction of
the catalyst shape. One hypothesis for the good preservation of the activity is that the
catalyst surface area increases as a result of the destruction of the surface, hence
enabling an easier access to the available active sites. For getting a better
understanding about the catalyst performance, further analysis with a nitrogen
adsorption analyzing method could be performed. This would give one a more precise
understanding on the changes in the specific area of the catalyst. A complete set of
SEM images from all reusability experiments can be found in Appendix II.

3.6. Kinetic modelling
3.6.1. Reaction stoichiometry
A kinetic model for the chemo-enzymatic self-epoxidation of fatty acids has earlier
been presented by Yadav et al. [26], which can be considered as a simplified version
of the reaction mechanism proposed by Warvel et al. [25]. The model by Yadav et al.
assumes that the formation of peroleic acid after the perhydrolysis process is briefly
lasting, hence there is no accumulation of peroleic acid in the system. Therefore, an
assumption of direct epoxidation between oleic acid and hydrogen peroxide catalyzed

molecular mechanism proposed by Warvel et al. makes no such assumption and,
therefore, the formation of peroleic acid is an aspect that has as well been taken into
consideration. The molecules considered in this work are represented in Figure 21.

Two different hypotheses of the rate determining stoichiometric steps have been
formed, one with peroleic acid and one without it.

Alternative 1:
𝐴+𝐻 → 𝐵+𝑊

(I)

𝐵+𝐴 →𝑅+𝐴

(II)

𝐵+𝐵 →𝑆+𝐴

(III)

The second alternative for the stoichiometry is assuming a direct epoxidation of oleic
acid (A) and hydrogen peroxide (H) and, thus, no peroleic acid (B) is formed.
Consequently, no epoxidized peroleic acid (S) is formed in this version.

Alternative 2:
𝐴+𝐻 → 𝑅+𝑊

(IV)

Both options for the stoichiometry can be extended to obtain a better overview on the
reaction steps. A typical way to do this is by dividing the steps into adsorption,
bimolecular surface reactions, and desorption steps. Here, the catalyst surface site (*)
is included in the mechanisms.

3.6.2. Epoxidation mechanisms and rate equations
Different options for the epoxidation mechanisms should be considered in the
modelling work. Four different competing models are described and evaluated, using
the previously described alternatives for the overall stoichiometry.

Model 1
In this model, the concept of using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism in
heterogeneous catalysis is used. Here all the molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface
react, eventually creating the product. The assumption that all components are
adsorbed only to one active catalyst site each is used. These assumptions give the
following detailed mechanism:

In this model, the adsorption and desorption steps can be interpreted as rapid reactions
reaching quasi-equilibria, being rapid compared to the time-demanding and
irreversible bimolecular steps. The generation rates rI, rII and rIII for the overall
reaction steps can be described as

rI = k I c A * c H *

(6)

rII = k II c A * c B *

(7)

rIII = k III c B *2

(8)

The equilibrium constant of the adsorption and desorption quasi-equilibria steps can
be expressed as

Ki =

ci *
ci c *

(9)

and this expression can be rearranged to
𝑐𝑖∗ = 𝐾𝑖 𝑐𝑖 𝑐 ∗

(10)

where ci* represents the concentrations for all molecules adsorbed on an active catalyst
site. Adding the concentration of vacant surface sites c* brings us to a total
concentration of catalyst surface sites c0,
c * + c j * = c0

(11)

Thus, the following equations can be used for calculating the concentration of vacant
sites c* and for the concentration of adsorbed molecules on catalyst cj*, respectively

c* =

c0
1+  K jc j

ci * =

K i ci c 0
1+  K jc j

Inserting these into the rate equations (6)-(8) gives the following rate equations

of R, S, B, H, and W compared to A leads us to a useful approximation

(21)

In previous sections, the existence of ring-opening products were proven by the
titriometrically obtained results, and later confirmed by the NMR analysis. In order to
obtain a realistic description of the reaction kinetics and to improve the model fit to
experimental data, the rate of ring-opening has to be included in the model.
Bimolecular reactions were assumed for the ring-opening reactions.

Model 2
The underlying theory behind this model is based on the assumption that no peroleic
acid is accumulated, as presented previously by Yadav et al. [26]. Here an active
complex is formed between oleic acid (A), hydrogen peroxide (H) and the immobilized
lipase (*). The adsorption of water (W) and hydrogen peroxide (H) was neglected. All
reaction steps are presented in .

Model 3
This model is a combination of the two previously presented models. Here the theory
relies on the hypothesis that peroleic acid (B) is formed through a reaction of an active
complex between oleic acid (A), hydrogen peroxide (H) and lipase (*). This peroleic
acid (B) reacts further with oleic acid (A) and peroleic acid (B), creating epoxidized
oleic acid and epoxidized peroleic acid. The mechanism of this model is presented in

3.6.3. Component mass balances
As previously mentioned, the interfacial mass transfer between the aqueous and the
organic phase is one of the key steps for this liquid-liquid-solid system. It can be
assumed that the actual epoxidation reaction takes place in the organic phase, while
the formation of peroleic acid through perhydrolysis takes place in the aqueous phase
[44]. Therefore, the mass balances are divided into two parts according to the reaction
phase.
The mass balance of hydrogen peroxide and water in the aqueous phase is described
as

0 = Ni A +

dnai
dt

(69)

for i= H, W. Analogously, the expression for the organic phase mass transfer

N i A + ri mcat =

dnoi
dt

(70)

where A is the interfacial area between the aqueous and organic phases and mcat is the
mass of the catalyst. By assuming that the interfacial mass transfer is rapid compared
to the reactions in both phases, these two phase-dependent mass transfer differential
equations can be combined to,

ri mcat =

dnai dnoi
+
dt
dt

(71)

The change in volume in both phases is assumed to be negligible. Hence, the phasespecific mass balances can be expressed as follows,

dnai
dc
= Va ai
dt
dt

(72)

dnoi
dc
= Vo oi
dt
dt

(73)

Consequently, a total mass balance can be written as
𝑉𝑎

𝑑𝑐𝑎𝑖
𝑑𝑡

𝑑𝑐

𝑜𝑖

= 𝑟𝑖 𝑚𝑐𝑎𝑡
𝑖

(74)

where KDi is the distribution coefficient of a component i = H, W between the
phases, defined by

For this liquid-liquid-catalyst three phase reactor, the catalyst bulk density is defined

This is introduced into the mass balance (74), finally resulting in

(80)

An analogous approach can be used for the organic phase concentration,

dcoi (1 −  )ri  c
=
dt K i + 1 − 

(81)

Equations (80) and (81) are created for components that exist in both phases (i= H,
W), while the components that only exist in the organic phase (i= A, B, R and S) follow
the model,

dcoi

3.6.4. Parameter estimation
The parameter estimation for the mathematical model is based on the titrimetric
analysis results consisting of the following parts: oxirane number for determining the
amount of epoxy groups, iodine value for the remaining, unreacted double bonds, and
hydrogen peroxide concentration. The analysis results, which are previously presented
and discussed in this work, are divided into three different states for optimizing the
reaction parameters as shown below.
Organic phase:

s1 = c A + c B

(83)

s2 = cR + cS

(84)

Aqueous phase:
(85)

s 3 = c aH

The parameter estimation is executed by minimizing the objective function Q,
consisting of the sum of squares between the experimental data si,exp and the estimated
values sit,
Q=

 (s

i ,t exp

− sit ) 2

(86)

In order to reach optimal parameters for fitting the model to experimental data, a series
of repeated parameter estimations was carried out using the function lsqcurvefit with
a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [45] in the MATLAB 2019b software. The
parameter estimation was performed simultaneously while using the function ode45,
which is implementing the 4th order Runge-Kutta method for a numerical solution of
systems of ordinary differential equations [46], [47].
The estimated unknown parameters in models 1 and 3 were the rate constants k’1 and
k’2, and kROP, the adsorption equilibrium constants KA and KH, and the distribution
coefficient KDH. The rate constant k’3 for the rate equation r3 was neglected due to
parameter values close to zero. In model 2, the rate constants k’ and kROP, the
adsorption equilibrium constants KA, KAH, and the distribution coefficient KDi were

estimated. Model 4 was optimized to a four-parameter model, implying that only k’,
kROP, KA and KDH were estimated. The adsorption equilibrium constants KB, KR, KW,
and KS were not considered in any parameter estimations due to a predominant
adsorption of A over the rest of the components. Detected outliers in the experimental
data were corrected by interpolation for reaching a better fit of the computed data by
the model. Table 8 show the estimated parameters and the statistical errors and results
for the estimations.

The best model is determined by comparing the accuracy of estimated parameters
(Table 8-Table 11) and the estimated fit to the experimental data (Figure 22-Figure
25). Model 4 shows the best parameter estimation for the reproduction of the
experimental data with relative standard errors below 40% for all estimated
parameters. However, considering the low concentrations of the ring-opening products
that are formed in the reaction, Model 1 shows nearly as good signs of accuracy as
Model 4, despite a broad confidence interval for kROP. When taking the molecular
aspects into consideration, it is likely that the formation of peroleic acid is needed for
a spontaneous epoxidation reaction, as in the case for the Prileschajew epoxidation.
Thus, models 1 and 3 are the most probable mechanisms for this chemo-enzymatic
epoxidation, model 1 being the most accurate one.
The statistical results in Table 12 show, however, that the difference in the residual
sum of squares between all four competing models is very small, thus, the fit of all
models can be considered similar. Another observation is that the perhydrolysis step
rI seems to be remarkably slower than the epoxidation step rII. Thus, it can be
concluded that the perhydrolysis step is rate determining in this chemo-enzymatic
epoxidation of fatty acids. This observation is analogous with previous studies of the
classical Prileschajew epoxidation method [22], [48].

4. Conclusions
Epoxidation of oleic acid with the enzymatic approach using immobilized lipase as
catalyst was successfully performed in this work. The results of the experiments
showed that very high conversions of the double bonds in oleic acid are achievable by
this method.
The original plan was to conduct the experiments using the SpinChem® RBR as a
rotating catalyst bed, yet the conversions did not reach feasible levels. This was
possibly caused by the high viscosity of oleic acid that impaired the mass transfer from
the liquid to the catalyst. However, using the same device as a stirrer delivered
promising results, thus leading to a conclusion that using SpinChem as an empty
stirring device is sufficient for this purpose.
The concentrations of hydrogen peroxide has an impact on the conversions,
particularly in silent systems where an OA:HP molar ratio of 1:2 provided the highest
reaction rates, but also 1:1.5 reached similar conversion levels on a longer 12-hour
time perspective. Ultrasound irradiation improved the epoxidation rate by facilitating
the formation of a fine emulsion, that presumably enhanced the interfacial mass
transfer. This led to an increase in the reaction rate of the perhydrolysis step where
peroleic acid is formed from oleic acid and hydrogen peroxide. A top conversion value
was reached after three hours of reaction with 90% amplitude of the ultrasound horn,
and NMR analysis confirmed that there were no double bonds left after four hours of
reaction. Furthermore, the concentration of epoxy groups was decreasing after four
hours, and an accumulation of ring-opening products, predominantly consisting of
esters, can be observed at longer reaction times. Hence, the reaction in the presence of
ultrasound should be ended after four to five hours of reaction time to obtain the
highest values of the desired product.
A temperature range of 30-60 ˚C was screened without larger differences in the
reaction rate or conversion. Nevertheless, the solidification of epoxide led to
operational issues in lower temperatures of 30 ˚C and 45 ˚C. Consequently, the
temperatures 50 ˚C and 60 ˚C were used to keep the organic phase workable. Stirring
rates of 500, 750 and 1000 rpm were compared, with analogous results in reaction rate
and conversion.

Conclusions

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The catalyst reusability is a main issue for the economic viability of using Novozym®
435 as a catalyst for the epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. A series of three
successive experiments of reusing catalyst was performed in both silent and ultrasound
modes. The results were promising, showing low signs of deactivation in both modes.
However, the SEM images revealed that the catalyst morphology had been
substantially impacted by the acoustic cavitation caused by ultrasound irradiation. It
cannot either be disregarded that the catalyst reusability experiments were only partly
conducted with reused catalyst, thus, the good results are potentially influenced by the
fresh catalyst added to each reusability experiment. It would be desirable to study the
reusability using only reused catalyst in order to obtain completely reliable results.
Four different reaction mechanisms for mathematical modelling were proposed, all of
them reaching a good enough fit to describe the experimental data. However, the
mechanisms including the perhydrolysis step gave the best representation of data. Also
considering the already existing theory for lipase catalyzed chemo-enzymatic
epoxidation, the perhydrolysis step is needed for the epoxidation reaction between
oleic and peroleic acid. Nevertheless, the models without the perhydrolysis step
showed also good fit and low parameter standard errors due to the simplicity of the
models.
In conclusion, the chemo-enzymatic approach to epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids
assisted by ultrasound irradiation showed promising results. However, previous
studies have indicated that a rapid addition of hydrogen peroxide can cause catalyst
deactivation, therefore, a semibatch process where hydrogen peroxide is added during
a longer time-period could be studied in the future. Experiments where a simple
alkene, such as octane, dodecane or an ester of oleic acid without a carboxylic group,
is exposed by hydrogen peroxide could give further answers whether a direct
epoxidation of double bonds is possible to obtain without the perhydrolysis step.
Additionally, analysis on the existence of peroleic acid during a typical chemoenzymatic epoxidation experiment would presumably determine whether the reaction
mechanism goes through the percarboxylic acid route or not.

Lipaskatalyserad kemisk-enzymatisk epoxidering av fettsyror med hjälp av
ultraljud som en processintensifieringsmetod

Klimatförändringen har fört med sig nya utmaningar i att övergå från traditionella
fossilt baserade naturresurser till förnybara resurser. Epoxidering av omättade,
växtbaserade fettsyror är en metod som kan föra oss vidare mot en hållbar process
inom kemikalietillverkning. Dessa epoxiderade oljor kan användas i produktionen av
kemikalier som bland annat smörjmedel, mjukgörare i polymera produkter samt
biobaserad och icke-isocyanatbaserad polyuretan. Omättade växtbaserade fettsyror
härstammar vanligtvis från olika förnybara resurser som sojabönan, palm, raps,
solrosfrön, linfrön och bomullsfrön. I Nordeuropa är tallolja, vilket är en biprodukt
från sulfatprocessen i skogsindustrin, en stor hållbar råvara för vidareförädling till
viktiga intermediära molekyler inom produktionen av förnybara kemikalier.
Detta arbete fokuserar på kemisk-enzymatisk epoxidering av oljesyra som en
modellmolekyl, katalyserat av immobiliserat lipas. I motsats till den traditionella
Prileschajews epoxideringsreaktionen av dubbelbindningar behövs ingen tillsatt
karboxylsyra för att möjliggöra processen. Endast fettsyra, en oxidant som till exempel
väteperoxid samt immobiliserat lipas behövs för att producera epoxiderade oljor enligt
denna enzymatiska metod. Processförloppet sker i två steg: perhydrolys av fettsyrans
karboxylgrupp till perfettsyra med hjälp av immobiliserat lipas, efterföljt av kemisk
epoxidering av fettsyrans dubbelbindning med perfettsyran som nukleofil. Detta sker
i

ett

trefassystem

där

perhydrolysen

sker

i

vattenfasen

och

själva

epoxideringsreaktionen mellan fettsyra och perfettsyra sker i den organiska fasen. Den
intermediära massöverföringen mellan faserna möjliggörs genom att en gynnsam
reaktionsomgivning bestående av en emulsion skapas.
Reaktionen intensifieras med hjälp av ultraljud vilket har en höjande effekt på
reaktionshastigheten. Det intensifierande fenomenet grundar sig på akustisk
kavitation, vilket innebär att små gasbubblor först skapas av ultraljud som växer större
i systemet genom kompression och expansion. Detta leder slutligen till en snabb
kollaps av bubblorna varefter lokala punkter med höga tryck och temperaturer skapas.

Fenomenet gör att massöverföringen mellan reaktionsfaserna intensifieras då en mer
stabil emulsion skapas jämfört med en emulsion som skapas produceras enbart med
omrörning i reaktorn.
En isotermisk satsreaktor med en roterande katalysatorbädd SpinChem® RBR samt
ultraljudsanläggning insatt i reaktorn användes i samtliga experiment. Oljesyra och
väteperoxid användes som reaktanter, och immobiliserat lipas (Novozym® 435)
användes som katalysator. Reaktionskinetiken analyserades med titrimetriska metoder
där icke-reagerade kvarstående fettsyra som reaktant (jodtalet, eng. Iodine value, enligt
Hanus metod), koncentrationen epoxiderad fettsyra som produkt (oxiransyretalet, eng.
Oxirane oxygen value, enligt Jays metod) samt koncentrationen väteperoxid (enligt
Greenspan och MacKellars metod) analyserades under hela reaktionsförloppet i varje
experiment. En ytterligare analys av den kemiska sammansättningen gjordes med
kärnmagnetisk
spectroscopy,

resonansspektroskopi
NMR)

och

(eng.

studerades

med

svepelektronmikroskopi (eng. Scanning Electron Microscopy, SEM).
Användningen av olika koncentrationsförhållanden väteperoxid och fettsyra
studerades i kinetiska experiment utan ultraljud. I dessa experiment visade
koncentrationsförhållandet mellan oljesyra och väteperoxid på 1:2 vara det mest
effektiva med toppvärden i utbyte efter fyra timmars reaktion då både
reaktionshastigheten och utbytet utvärderades.
Ultraljudets inverkan på reaktionens omsättning och produktselektivitet studerades
genom att använda olika amplituder på 30 %, 60 % och 90 % med en frekvens på 20
kHz. Dessa experiment påvisade att den akustiska kavitationen orsakat av ultraljud har
en klar positiv påverkan på reaktionshastigheten. Experimentet utfört med 90 %
amplitud nådde sin topp i utbyte efter tre timmars reaktionstid. Dock kunde det inte
observeras en märkbar skillnad i slutligt utbyte mellan epoxideringsreaktionen som
utfördes i tysta förhållanden och de experiment som utfördes i närvaro av ultraljud.
Reaktionstemperaturens betydelse i ultraljudsförhållanden studerades. Tidigare
studier har indikerat att katalysatorns stabilitet kan påverkas av temperaturer som
överstiger 50 ⁰C samt av höga omrörningshastigheter. Temperaturens skadliga
påverkan på enzymstabiliteten kunde inte påvisas i högre grad av de experiment som
utfördes i detta arbete då experimentet i 60 ⁰C nådde de bästa resultaten i

reaktionshastighet och utbyte. Låga temperaturer på 45 ⁰C och 30 ⁰C ledde till att
produkten övergick i fast fas före reaktionsförloppets planerade slut. Därmed kan det
konstateras att lägre temperaturer kan orsaka begränsningar i massöverföringen mellan
vattenfasen och organiska fasen i reaktionssystemet.
Tidigare studier har påvisat att höga omrörningshastigheter även kan påverka lipasens
stabilitet, vilket kan leda till lägre reaktionshastigheter och utbyten. Med härledning
till detta studerades olika hastigheter på 500 rpm, 750 rpm och 1000 rpm, varav 750
rpm visade sig vara den mest effektiva. Dock kunde det konstateras att en hög
omrörningshastighet inte påverkar stabiliteten. Detta kan hypotetiskt vara på grund av
användandet av SpinChem® RBR vars filter omkring omrörarbladen kan anses ge ett
skydd för katalysatorns struktur.
Återanvändningen av katalysatorn är en väsentlig fråga för de ekonomiska aspekterna
i att använda Novozym® 435 som immobiserad katalysator för epoxidering av
omättade fettsyror. Detta studerades genom tre efterföljande experiment med
återanvänd katalysator i både tysta förhållanden och ultraljudsförhållanden. Dessa
experiment gav goda resultat med endast en liten minskning i reaktionshastigheten.
SEM bilder av katalysatorn i experimenten som studerade återanvändbarheten av
katalysatorn i ultraljudsförhållanden visade att katalysatorns yta förstördes av den
akustiska kavitationen. Detta påverkade trots allt inte katalysatorns kemiska aktivitet.
Den kemiska sammansättningen av produkterna som erhölls i tysta förhållanden,
ultraljudsförhållanden och från katalysatorns återanvändningsexperiment efter fyra
och åtta timmars reaktionstid analyserades med 1H-NMR. Resultaten visade att det
inte finns resterande omättad fettsyra kvar i ett enda analyserat prov efter åtta timmars
reaktionstid, vilket tyder på att ett fullständigt produktutbyte hade uppnåtts. Dock
kunde ringöppningsbiprodukter hittas, bestående främst av estrar och en mindre
mängd dioler. Dessa hade förmodligen bildats genom att fettsyrans karboxylgrupp
samt vatten hade agerat som nukleofiler i processen. Andelen biprodukter var ändå
relativt liten, i experimentet utfört i tysta förhållanden var andelen störst av alla
analyserade experiment med en mängd på ungefär 10 %.

Fyra olika matematiska modeller för reaktionskinetiken skapades samt estimering av
kinetiska och termodynamiska parametrar utfördes för att anpassa beräknade data med
experimentella data under tysta förhållanden. Statistiskt kunde endast smärre
skillnader ses mellan de olika modellerna, men kännedomen om de möjliga
reaktionsmekanismerna gjorde en mekanism som inkluderar perfettsyra till den mest
sannolika modellen.
Kemisk-enzymatisk epoxidering av omättande fettsyror med hjälp av immobiliserat
lipas som katalysator visade lovande resultat både i experiment med ultraljud och utan
ultraljud. Användningen av ultraljud visade sig vara gynnsamt med tanke på
reaktionssystemets effektivitet. Katalysatorn visade sig vara återanvändbar i både tysta
och ultraljudsförhållanden. I framtiden kunde det vara intressant att forska hur
användandet av en halvkontinuerlig reaktor med en långsammare tillsättning av
väteperoxid påverkar lipasens aktivitet och därmed även reaktionshastigheten och
produktselektiviteten. Ett experiment där en enkel alken utan en karboxylsyragrupp
såsom okten, dodeken eller oljesyrans ester skulle utsättas av väteperoxid med målet
att epoxidera dubbelbindningen kunde ge svar huruvida epoxideringen kan ske genom
en reaktionsmekanism som inte kräver persyra. Dessutom kunde existensen av
peroljesyra i den kemisk-enzymatiska epoxideringsmekanismen bevisas genom
titrimetisk analys under experimentets gång.
