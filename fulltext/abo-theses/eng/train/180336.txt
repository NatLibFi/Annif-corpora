Challenges in flame retardant wood coatings

Carried out under the supervision of Professor
Carl-Eric Wilén at the Laboratory of Polymer
Technology, Faculty of Science and Engineering,
Åbo Akademi University, Finland.

Flame retardant, emulsion polymerization, wood
coating, defoaming

This thesis was carried out with the scope to better understand the underlying
challenges of developing novel environmentally friendly flame retardant wood
coatings and to find possible solutions for overcoming such challenges. Several
different wood types were treated with specialty coating formulations containing
various flame retardant additives in order to obtain wood species exhibiting excellent
flame retardant properties together with other desired properties such as weathering
durability and visual appearance.
Emulsion polymerizations were conducted in order to obtain acrylic waterborne
core-shell dispersions having small particle sizes and high tolerance towards
electrolytes. Such dispersions might be suitable for exterior and/or interior wood
coatings.
One deficiency most wood coatings have is excessive foaming. Excessive foaming
can cause problems, especially during industrial application of coating. A test
method was developed, and five different antifoaming additives were tested for their
defoaming efficacy and their storage stability. DF-2 was found to be suitable for the
dispersion, as low amounts of DF-2 had a strong decreasing effect on foaming as
well as positive impact on long-term storage stability.

Cone calorimeter tests were performed on several coated wood samples in order to
determine the viability of different flame retardant additives. All additive-containing
coatings showed improved performance compared to the reference samples. Due to
the varying nature of wood samples, the cone calorimeter tests results are indicative
and may not fully correspond with full scale fire tests such as SBI.

1. Wood and wood-based materials
Wood has always played an important role as a construction material for housing and
tools. During humanity’s early days, the choice of material was mostly based upon
availability and workability, and our knowledge of wood was reliant purely on
experience. Even as society formed and eventually evolved into everything we see
today, our close relationship with wood never ceased. Today we possess a much
greater knowledge of wood, based on science and research – and its use has evolved
into a complex material capable of enhancing human life (Youngs, 2009).
While society and the industry, having during the industrialization period neglected
the implications of non-sustainable practices, the time of ignorance has now long
been passed. The United Nations 2030 Agenda (United Nations, 2015) places a
strong focus on sustainable development and urgent action against climate change
and in the EU’s roadmap for 2050 a goal is set to reduce carbon emissions by 80%
(European Commission, 2011). These goals require environmentally sustainable
materials for construction and production, and wood could be just such a material.

1.1.

Wood composition

In general, the composition of wood can be split into four different parts. Cellulose is
a polysaccharide of combined glucose monomers resulting in a high molecular
weight linear polymer. The cellulose content of wood is around 40%. Present along
with cellulose is hemicellulose, which is a shorter, branched polymer with lower
molecular weight and containing different monomers. The structure and amount of
hemicellulose varies with different tree species, but they generally make up 25% of
the wood.
Lignins are another major component of wood, accounting for around 30% of wood
composition. Lignin acts as the glue that binds the cellulose and hemicellulose,
1

André Båssar
creating a composite system in the wood. Lignin, like both cellulose and
hemicellulose, is composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, but also contains other
elements due to further reactions with other molecules found in the wood itself.
Wood extractives is the fourth and final part of wood. The term wood extractives
does not specify any one compound but it is, instead, a general term for different low
molecular weight compounds found in the porous structure of wood fibers. The
extractives found varies greatly between the different species but generally make up
around 5% of the wood composition. (Stevanovic, 2016)

1.2.

Wood products

It is widely known that in Finland and large parts of the world, sawn timber is the
main structural component of everyday domestic housing. One big issue with sawn
timber is the waste that is caused by cutting square boards out of round wood. In
larger scale projects, such as industrial construction or commercial high-rises, the
needs that must be met are much higher and the issues more complex than in a
domestic house. To meet these demands and to mitigate the issues of sawn timber,
engineered wood products (EWPs) have been developed. The list of different EWPs
is very long as the applications and their needs vary on a case-by-case basis, and new
EWPs are constantly in development to meet the needs of the future (Milner &
Woodard, 2016).

2

André Båssar

Figure 1. Different EWPs
The following EWPs are chosen to give an example of widely used EWPs and the
list is by no means exhaustive.

1.2.1. Glued laminated timber, Glulam

Glulam is often used in structural applications for example as a replacement for large
structurally supportive beams that earlier would have had to been sawn from large
trees or made out of metal. Instead of using one single beam, glulam is made by
adhesive bonding and jointing several laminates. In other words, sawn timber is dried
and then finger jointed together with other boards to an appropriate length. The

3

André Båssar
jointed board is then glued together with others of the same length to reach the
needed width and height (Milner & Woodard, 2016).

1.2.2. Plywood

Plywood is based on veneer, i.e. thin slices of wood being glued together at an angle
towards each other. The advantage of using veneer instead of normal sawn wood is
that waste is minimized due peeling thin slices instead of cutting wide squares. This
is especially true for expensive types of wood, which would otherwise not be
economically viable. In plywood the number of veneer sheets are always uneven and
the wood grain direction of two adjacent sheets being in a 90-degree angle. Due to
the uneven number of sheets, both the top and bottom sheet will have the same grain
direction.

Plywood is mostly used in construction in the paneling, flooring and roofs of houses.
As well as in furniture like chairs and tables, or as a packaging material for more
valuable items (Hughes, 2015).

1.2.3. Laminated Veneer Lumber, LVL

LVL is very similar to plywood, as it is made by glue-laminating sheets of veneer
together. The main difference between LVL and plywood is that, in the case of LVL,
the grain direction is oriented in the same direction. This lowers the production time
and labor needed, making LVL a very economical EWP. The low cost and consistent
properties make LVL a popular material choice in a wide variety of wooden furniture
(Sasaki, 2001)

1.2.4. Oriented Strand Board, OSB

OSB has been developed as a replacement for plywood usage in housing applications
such as roofing, panels, and floors. It was developed in the 1960s and has since then
soared to a 75% market share of structural panels as of 2014. To make OSB the logs
are debarked and then sliced into thin strands. Resin is applied to the strands that are
then oriented and formed into a sheet, which is then glued to another sheet with
perpendicularly oriented strands (Nishimura, 2015).

1.2.5. Cross laminated timber, CLT

CLT is one of the newer EWPs, developed in Switzerland and Austria in the 1990s to
find a better use for the outer parts of logs that otherwise would be deemed to have
low economic value. CLT consists of at least three perpendicularly glued laminates.
In other words, it is very similar to glulam, but in the case of CLT each layer is at a
90-degree angle to the next whereas in glulam the grain of each layer is parallel. This
tradeoff gives CLT a more rigid structure while giving up the flexibility of glulam
(Harris, 2015).

1.2.6. Medium density fibreboad, MDF

MDF was developed as a way to make use of waste wood from other wood
production. The wood is fed to a chipper to make wooden particles of less than
50mm in diameter. Because the origin of the wood may vary, the particles need to be
washed before they continue through the process. They are then subjected to high
temperatures and pressure before being mixed with resins. This mixture can then be

5

André Båssar
formed into a mat and pressed into the desired thickness. This produces a cheap
panel with even density throughout.
Applications for MDF panels are for example flooring or furniture. The uniform
structure of MDF makes it a good choice for complicated and decorative structures.
However, there are drawbacks as well, as MDF has very poor moisture resistance as
well as health risks related to breathing in resins when working with the material
(Ormondroyd & Stefanovski, 2015).

2. Coatings for wood and products thereof
As previously discussed, wood is a very diverse material with many potential
applications. Houses big and small, indoor panels, doors, furniture, and much more
are often built out of wood. While using wood comes with many benefits such as
renewability, overall favorable life cycle, low VOCs and carbon dioxide emissions in
comparison to off-gasses from aluminum, steel, concrete and plastics, high
mechanical strength there are also some drawbacks of wood. Being a natural product,
wood requires protection from the impact of moisture, microbes and UV irradiation.
To solve these issues, most if not all wood used in any type of construction is coated
with a wood coat chosen based on the intended end application. The large number of
different uses for wood subsequentially leads to many different wood coatings,
ensuring sufficient protection for even every niche use. The following chapters will
compare the different types of wood coatings and their uses.

2.1. Solvent-borne coatings

Wood coatings can generally be split into two categories based on the medium in
which all the building blocks of the coat are diluted. The two mediums are water or
organic solvents, the latter will be discussed in this chapter. While solvent-borne
6

André Båssar
coatings generally provide better performance than its water-based counterparts do,
increasingly stringent regulations on the emission of Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOC) in the EU and the world limit the future viability of this type of coating
(Anderson & Daniels, 2003). The way coatings cure is by the evaporation of the
solvent (Guo, Chang, Sparks, & Fortmann, 1999), it is then obvious from an
environmental point of view that evaporating water into the air is always going to be
preferable to any other kind of solvent. Although the future may look bleak for
solvent-borne coatings, today the technology is still in wide use in several
applications.
One of the main advantages of solvent-borne coatings over waterborne coatings is
the ability to achieve very high solid content coatings. As solvents and water
especially, are in the eyes of the industry an unwanted expense in terms of both
storage and added weight, higher solid content in the final product is usually desired.
This combined with the fact that an increase in solid content simultaneously
decreases the solvent content, leading to a lower total VOC and lower environmental
impact gives hope for future use of solvent-borne coatings (Weiss, 1997)

2.2.

Waterborne coatings

Waterborne coatings has been the coating industries answer to stricter environmental
regulations. Using water as the medium in the coat comes with several advantages
over its solvent based counterpart, such as reduced VOC and especially important in
the case of this thesis: reduced flammability. Waterborne coatings come in many
different forms, but the general definition is a coating where the resin is dispersed in
water.
Most of the waterborne coatings are polymer dispersions and can be divided into
categories based on different criteria. One such criteria is the particle size of the
dispersed polymers which can range from as small as 1 nm to over 1 000 nm. The
most commonly used way is to categorize the coatings based on the type of resin that
is dispersed, e.g. acrylic dispersions.
7

André Båssar
Some examples of waterborne coatings are waterborne alkyd-based systems either as
the only resin or in a hybrid system combined with an acrylic dispersion. But by far
the most common type of waterborne coating used today are acrylic dispersions.
Acrylic dispersions are the product of emulsion polymerization and can be tailormade by the choice of monomer, the choice of stabilizer and the customization of the
particle morphology (Prieto & Kiene, 2018).

2.3.

Indoor coatings

Another distinct difference in wood coating technology and requirements is between
coatings intended for indoor versus outdoor use. Twenty years ago, there was a clear
distinction between the types of coatings used in Southern Europe compared to
Northern Europe. The southern countries preferred different types of polyurethane
coatings while the north leaned towards acid curing coatings. The stricter regulations
across the EU as well as the growing interest in environmental sustainability have
since then united Europe in a move towards sustainable coating technologies, such as
UV-coatings or waterborne coatings.
The requirements of indoor coatings vary widely depending on end use. The
demands of stress resistance in a coating for a chair or flooring is, for example, much
higher than that of a picture frame. Some general requirements of indoor coatings
would be good wettability and low roughening of the wood as well as the finished
coat being uniform in its appearance, as even a slight deviation in appearance is
easily noticed indoors (Prieto & Kiene, 2018).

2.4.

Outdoor coatings

In outdoor coatings, we are seeing the same trend as in indoor coatings, i.e. a move
towards sustainable coatings. However, the demands on outdoor coatings are
8

André Båssar
substantially different from those of indoor coatings. Roughly 95% of outdoor wood
coatings are used in liquid form, which means that there is a solvent involved in the
process. This sets an even stronger focus on lowering the VOCs in the coating. Other
demands on outdoor coatings include uniform aesthetics, protection against moisture
and UV radiation and protection against microbes such as fungi. Furthermore, the
coating must withstand severe weather conditions for prolonged periods of time
without deterioration. In the case of larger municipal buildings or high rise buildings,
the coating must also provide sufficient protection against fire, a requirement that
often interferes with the previously demanded low VOC content (de Meijer, 2001)

2.5.

Opaque coatings

Opaque coatings are what most people mean when they say “paint”. While there are
many different types of opaque coatings based on different solvents and techniques,
they all completely cover the wood grain. This means that, in terms of
protectiveness, opaque coatings are better than transparent coatings because the
wood is covered by pigment and therefore is not in contact with any UV-light.
Other advantages of opaque coatings are, for example, greater protection against
surface erosion as well as access to more colors, as the underlying wood will not
affect the color of the coat. A disadvantage of opaque coatings is the high amount of
pigment used, as this can negatively affect long-term storage stability as the solid
content of the coating increases (Feist, 2006).

2.6.

Transparent coatings

While opaque coatings offer a wider variety of colors, there are many cases where
one would want to keep the appearance of the wood while still protecting it from the
environment and even adding a hint of color. Transparent coats, especially for
9

André Båssar
outdoor use, do not perform to the same level as their opaque counterparts. The main
issue is the low amount or even lack of pigment, which in opaque coatings provides
important UV protection (Evans, Haase, Shakri, Seman, & Kiguchi, 2015).
Transparent coatings are also more prone to discoloration as time progresses, which
is significantly more noticeable when the wood is coated with a low-pigmented
coating. However, with the right combination of protective additives and particle
morphology it is possible to make a durable transparent coat, enhancing the wood’s
own natural features (Prieto & Kiene, 2018).

3. Application processes for wood coatings
Finding the right coating for a given project is not the only step needed for a
successful result. Another equally important step is the application of the coating
from its various containers onto the wood. In individual projects such as private
houses, the application is often done by hand, but as the scale of the project grows,
automation becomes a necessity.
Many factors need to be considered when choosing an application system. These
include but are not limited to application rate, transfer efficiency, quality of the final
product, and cost. Application rate is the amount of coating needed to create a film of
a desired thickness. Transfer efficiency expresses the ratio between coating applied
to the surface versus total coating consumed during the process. The final coating
should be of high quality and of the lowest possible cost.
In general, for liquid coatings the application methods can be divided into two main
categories. Contact methods involve the application system, coating and wooden
surface all being in contact with each other. Atomizing methods are the other type
and involve droplets of the coating being applied at the surface without the applicator
and surface coming into contact with each other (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 9 Operational Aspects of Wood Coatings: Application and Surface Preparation, 2009).

10

3.1. Roller coating

Roller coating is a simple method of application in which a suitable roll is chosen,
and a coating is distributed on its surface. The application of coating is carried out by
direct contact of the roll rotating on the wooden surface. Movement of the wood
through the process is also done by rollers. Any excess coating not applied to the
wood is scraped off the roll using a doctor blade before new coating is applied to the
roller. The number of rollers and the material covering them, as well as the direction
of their rotation versus the substrate can be varied to adjust the end result.
Roller coating can only be utilized on completely flat surfaces, as the uniformity of
the coating relies on the wood being fed through a fixed gap. Multi component
coatings or coatings with low working life are not suitable for roller coating,
whereas for single component coatings, high viscosity and high solid content
coatings, roller coating offers many advantages.
Transfer efficiency in roller coating is very high, as unused coating is recirculated
back into the process. The systems themselves are often automized and require
minimal manual labor. Roller coating also allows for precise regulation of the
application rate as well as excellent film thickness and uniformity with high viscosity
and high solid content coatings (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 9 - Operational
Aspects of Wood Coatings: Application and Surface Preparation, 2009).

3.2.

Curtain coating

Curtain coating is another flat surface application system. The coating is either
pressed or allowed to fall using gravity through a head which forms it into a thin
curtain. A conveyor belt below moves the wooden surface through the curtain which
applies the coating to the surface. Any excess coating can be gathered and recycled
back into the system.

11

André Båssar
Curtain coaters suffer from many of the same shortcomings as the roller coaters.
These include the need for a flat surface, issues with multi component systems and
problems coating the edges of the wood. As for multi component systems, this issue
can be solved using several heads, combining the different components of the system
immediately on the surface. Another limitation of curtain coating is a sensitivity to
air draught disturbing the flowing curtain.
The main advantage of curtain coating is the ease and efficiency of its use. The speed
of the conveyor belt pushing the wood can reach up to 100 meters per minute with
application rates of up to 300g per square meter. Curtain coating can also be
combined with roller coating for complex two component coats (Bulian &
Graystone, Chapter 9 - Operational Aspects of Wood Coatings: Application and
Surface Preparation, 2009).

3.3.

Dipping

Dipping is a fast and cheap way to apply low viscosity coating. Mainly used when
the surface needing to be coated is uneven or otherwise difficult to coat. This method
is simply done by dipping the wooden surface into an open tank of coating and
withdrawing it at a set rate to reduce sagging. Nevertheless, even with precautions in
place, dipping is not the method of choice for products with a demand for high
quality finishes. The method is also not suitable for solvent-borne or high VOC
coatings as the evaporation from the open tanks pose both environmental and health
hazards (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 9 - Operational Aspects of Wood Coatings:
Application and Surface Preparation, 2009).

12

André Båssar

3.4.

Spray coating

Spray coating is an example of an atomizing coating method. Conventional spray
coaters are a three-part system composed of a body filled with coating, a head acting
as the air intake to increase the pressure, and a nozzle which shapes the coating into
droplets before pressing them out into the air.
One of the advantages of using spray coating is the ability to create a uniform film on
most surfaces. Multi-component coating systems can also be kept separately, and
then mixed in the head, thereby allowing easy application. The main drawback of
spray coating is its poor transfer efficiency, sometimes as low as 30%.
Environmental and health regulations limit the usability of a system that could waste
70% of the coating. The lacking transfer efficiency has been mitigated by
automatization and new technologies, such as hydraulic atomization, but no spray
coating method can reach the near 100% transfer efficiency seen in contact coating
methods (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 9 - Operational Aspects of Wood Coatings:
Application and Surface Preparation, 2009).

4. Polymers and emulsions
Polymers are a chain of repeating units of molecules or molecule groups.
Repeating unit refers to the covalently bonded monomers that are combined to
make a long chain, i.e. the polymer. While most polymers have a high molecular
weight, it is possible to steer the reaction to control the molecular weight, as well
as many other parameters, that determine the final properties of the material. By,
for example, changing the ratio of monomers, reaction conditions, or reaction
techniques, one can tailor make the final characteristics of the polymer.
Characteristics that are important to control are, for example, the molecular
weight and the molecular weight distribution, chemical composition,
crosslinking, particle morphology, and chain configuration, as these determine
the final properties of the polymer (Mandal, 2013).
13

4.1.

Emulsion polymerization

Emulsion polymerization is the reaction of free radicals with monomer molecules
that have been dispersed in an appropriate medium. The two types of emulsion
polymerizations are waterborne and solvent-borne, of which the waterborne is the
more common type. Waterborne refers to the monomers as the hydrophobic ‘oil’,
and water as the dispersion medium. The result is a colloidal system with insoluble
polymer particles finely dispersed in an aqueous medium, typically called a latex.
The properties of the final latex vary, depending on reaction time, reaction rate,
monomer composition, temperature, and so on. It is therefore very important to be
able to control the reaction process, so as to achieve a latex suited for the specific end
use.
The controllability of the process is one of the strengths of emulsion polymerization.
Another advantage that emulsion polymerization has over other common
polymerization methods, is that the polymerization rate and the molecular weight is
not inversely proportional, as it often is in other methods. Emulsion polymerization
also offers better heat dissipation and viscosity control compared to, for example,
bulk polymerization. This means that by using emulsion polymerization, it is
possible to achieve a high rate of polymerization, as well as a high molecular weight
(Szycher, 2013).

4.1.1. Free radical polymerization

Polymerization reactions are divided into step-growth and chain polymerizations;
free radical polymerization is a sub-category of the latter. These types of
polymerizations are often exothermic and have high propagation rates. The lifetime
of a polymer chain in these reactions is less than one second.
Free radical polymerization is divided into three or four simultaneously occurring
reactions. These reactions are the initiation reaction, wherein the radicals are
continuously generated, the propagation, which causes the growth of the polymer
14

André Båssar
chain by the addition of monomers, and the termination, where two radicals react and
consume each other (Kiparissides, 1996). The fourth reaction is a separate chain
transfer reaction that controls the molecular weight of the produced polymer chains
(Soroush & Grady, 2019).

4.1.2. Typical emulsion polymerization

An emulsion polymerization is typically carried out by emulsifying monomers in an
aqueous medium after which the initiation reaction is started by an added watersoluble initiator, e.g. KPS (potassium persulfate). The resulting polymers are not
miscible with water and therefore need stabilizers to ensure the stability of the
colloidal system. For this purpose, different types of surfactants can be added at
different stages of the reaction and even afterwards.
The emulsion polymerization takes place mainly in the formed micelles. A mixture
of monomers and surfactants are introduced to the initiator, which thermally
decompose to free radicals that initiates the polymerization process and gives raise to
particle embryos. This short nucleation is very important as it heavily affects the
finished latexes properties such as particle size and its distribution.
If sufficient amount of surfactant is present in the mixture the critical micelle
concentration (CMC) is reached, meaning that monomer-swollen micelles are
present in the aqueous medium. These micelles have a much larger surface area to
the medium than conventionally dispersed droplet-type monomers. This means that
when the initiator is added, the micelles and the droplets compete to react with the
free radicals but due to the much larger area of the micelles they are more likely to be
the winner in this scenario, this is called heterogeneous nucleation. Even the radicals,
which do react with the dispersed monomers will in time, increase their
hydrophobicity as the reactions continue until they find themselves hydrophobic
enough and precipitate. The polymer is then stabilized by the surfactants and
monomers can continue to diffuse into the organic phase, this is called homogeneous
nucleation (Chern, 2008).

4.2.

Emulsion mechanisms

The mechanism of emulsion polymerization is generally divided into three intervals.
In the first interval an aqueous solution is mixed with an amount of surfactant
exceeding the CMC. This produces the needed micelles as well as stabilizes the
monomer droplets in the solution. The free radicals generated from the initiator gives
raise to oligomeric radicals which in turn diffuse into the micelles and thereby
nucleating the particle. This continues until all the micelles have been transformed
into growing polymer particles or consumed as stabilizers for polymer particles. If no
coagulation occurs, the number of particles formed in this step will be constant
throughout the whole polymerization process.
The second interval starts when the micelles in the solution have all either seeded by
monomer radicals or been used for stabilization of the other particles. The remaining
monomers in the solution continue to diffuse into the polymer particles created in
step one. The polymerization rate depends largely on the solubility of the monomers
in water, but since the number of particles remain constant – so will the reaction rate
of this interval.
When the monomers have all been diffused into the polymer particles and no
monomer droplets are left in the solution, interval three is initiated. It is during this
interval that the termination of the polymerization reaction occurs. The remaining
monomers in the solution will be consumed, causing the reaction rate to decrease in
proportion to the decreasing number of monomers left in the solution. When the
monomers decrease, so will the rate of mass transfer which when it nears zero means
that the reaction is terminated. (Harkins, 1947)

4.3.

Emulsion polymerization processes

There are three different processes widely used for production of latexes. These are
batch, semi batch and continuous reactors. In a laboratory scale, batch reactions are
often used to study different phenomena and develop new latexes. In a larger scale,
16

André Båssar
batch reactors come with too many problems such as temperature control to be of
any real use. In the industrial world semi batch or continuous reactors are the
preferred methods (Schork, 2014).

4.3.1. Batch reactors

In a batch reactor the monomers and surfactants are dispersed in an aqueous medium
in one batch. The surfactants are there to adsorb onto the monomer droplets to
stabilize the system while any excess surfactant create micelles. The reaction is often
started with the help of thermal initiators such as KPS at temperatures ranging
between 75 to 90 degrees Celsius. If higher initiation rates or lower temperatures are
needed for the reaction, Redox systems could be used. During the nucleation stage
when the polymers are formed, monomer droplets, monomer swollen micelles and
and polymer particles coexist in the batch reactor, competing for the radicals. As
time goes on the amount of monomer and micelles will decrease as they are
transformed into polymers. This corresponds to interval I in Harkin’s theory.
Intervals II and III then proceed as described earlier (Schork, 2014).

4.3.2. Semi continuous and continuous reactors

Semi continuous reactors work in a similar way to the batch reactor but in this case
the monomers, surfactants, initiators, and water are continuously added into the
reactor. The trick is that the rate of polymerization should be higher than the rate at
which the monomers are added to the reactor. If this is not the case, monomer
droplets will instead be formed which will hinder the controllability of the reaction
and product properties.
Continuous reactors work in the same way as semi continuous except for an extra
step in which the product is also extracted from the reactor continuously as opposed
17

André Båssar
to the semi continuous case where the product is extracted at the end of the reaction.
Other than the obvious differences in the mechanical steps, both the semi and the
continuous reaction’s processes are the same as the batch reactions. One added bonus
of these continuous systems is the added control over the reaction and of the ratio
between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. (Schork, 2014)

4.4.

Components of emulsion polymerization

While many components can be included in an emulsion polymerization that
influence the properties of the final product, a few key components make up the base
of any emulsion polymerization. These are water, monomers, surfactants, and
initiators. Controlling the properties and ratios of these key components is the recipe
for success for any emulsion polymerization.
The medium of the emulsion polymerization is water, being the obvious choice for
dispersing monomers as they most often have a low solubility in water. Water is easy
and cheap to work with, but this also means that transportation of water is not
economical. The key to a successful emulsion is to have the highest solid content
possible without affecting the stability of the final product (Anderson & Daniels,
2003).

4.4.1. Monomers

The choice of monomer is an important part of the process of planning a latex. The
properties of the final product are mostly determined by the selection of monomers
used in the emulsion. Additionally, there can be requirements such as cost or health
concerns that must be taken into consideration. Common monomers used in latexes
are for example styrenes, acrylics and methacrylics.

18

André Båssar
While emulsion polymerization can be carried out using only a single monomer type,
most commercial latexes use a combination of two or more as this allows for easier
control of the final properties. By changing the ratio of different monomers one can
control the glass transition temperature, mechanical properties and much more
(Anderson & Daniels, 2003).

4.4.2. Initiators

The initiator is the trigger of the whole polymerization process. Its purpose being to
generate free radicals and allow for the nucleation of particles. Most initiators used in
emulsion polymerization are water soluble, for example different persulfates.
Another added bonus of persulfate initiators are their ionic nature as it helps stabilize
the system by giving the latex an anionic surface charge (Anderson & Daniels,
2003).

4.4.3. Surfactants

Surfactants, sometimes referred to as emulsifiers are another important decision in
the polymerization planning process. There are many kinds of surfactants that can be
used to make a latex, and as the surfactants largely determine the particle size and
final stability of the system. An insufficient amount of surfactant can lead to
coagulation of the final product while an excessive amount can lead to unwanted
nucleation, foaming and worsened properties of the final film.
The three main kinds of surfactants are anionic, cationic, and nonionic. Oftentimes
the latex recipes contain a combination of several surfactants, mixtures of anionic
and nonionic being the most common as the anionic surfactant contributes greatly
during the nucleation stage while nonionic surfactants help stabilize the final product
(Anderson & Daniels, 2003).
19

André Båssar
Any ionically stabilized emulsion must be stabilized using the same type of electrical
charge. Combining anionic and cationic surfactants will only lead to problems in
stability (Goldschmidt & Streitberger, 2018).

4.5.

Evaluating emulsion stability

Emulsions used for coatings and in several other industries are often mixed with
other additives and stored for months or even years. When selling a commercial
product, the producer cannot fully control transportation nor storage conditions of
painting companies. This places great importance on the long-term stability of the
emulsion both in terms of long-term storage under a wide range of conditions and in
terms of stability against added additives, for example electrolytes.
There are many different factors affecting the stability of a colloidal system. Initially
scientists believed that the balance between van der Waals forces and electrostatic
repulsion was the two key factors. It has been shown that other factors such as steric
repulsion, hydration, oscillatory surface forces and so on also impact the stability of a
colloidal system.
There are four ways an emulsion might become unstable. Creaming occurs when two
liquids with different densities separate, leading to the lighter liquid gathering on top.
Flocculation means that the droplets in the emulsion start aggregating to each other
to form bigger structures, but without direct contact. This can be either reversible or
irreversible depending on the cause of the flocculation. Coalescence is similar to
flocculation but in this case the drops completely mix together to form a single drop.
And finally, Ostwald ripening is the chemical potential difference between two
different sized drops resulting in molecular diffusion from the small drop to the
larger one (Petsev, 2015).
One way to gain insight to the stability of an emulsion is to measure its zeta
potential. Zeta potential is a measurement of the repulsion between charged particles
in a dispersion. A high value in either positive or negative direction means that the

20

André Båssar
particles in the dispersion are highly charged, leading to electrostatic repulsion and a
stable emulsion.
While measurements of zeta potential are a good indicator of emulsion stability, a
high ZP value does not equal a stable emulsion, as other factors also affect stability.
A low ZP value could however indicate that the emulsion will coagulate during
storage (Samimi, Maghsoudnia, Eftekhari, & Dorkoosh, 2019). By storing emulsions
and continuously measuring their zeta potential, the rate of decrease in zeta potential
could however be used to monitor emulsion stability (Bhatt, Prasad, Singh, &
Panpalia, 2010).

4.6.

Anti-foaming agents

Foam can cause issues in the industrial application of wood coatings. To combat this
issue, many wood coating producers add anti-foaming agents to their recipe.
However, there are many different types of foams, and consequently many different
route causes. To effectively remove excessive foam from a wood coating, one must
first understand the underlying cause of the foaming.
Some foams, especially in low viscosity liquids, are not an issue and will quickly
disappear. Nevertheless, as the viscosity rises, the speed at which the foam escapes
slows down. Combined with surfactants that stabilize the bubbles, this can become a
problem. The two main types of foam in wood coatings are microfoam and spherical
bubbles. Microfoam is air trapped inside the coating itself, while spherical bubbles
are larger bubbles on the surface of the coating.
In a liquid without any surfactant, the air will simply rise until it reaches the surface,
and the liquid lamella will burst, letting the air escape. In wood coatings, these
lamellae are stabilized by surfactants, both on the inner and outer walls of the bubble.
The repulsive forces between the surfactants on the inner and outer walls of the
bubble create a film that is thick enough to withstand the pressure of the air without
bursting. This effect is enhanced by the fact that if the lamella is stretched in any
way, the surface tension caused by the sudden lack of surfactants will restore the
21

André Båssar
bubble to its original position. To counteract this, the defoaming agent must induce
non-uniformity in the surface tension, allowing the bubble to burst.
A defoaming agent should be tiny droplets, insoluble in the coating substance. These
droplets attack the foam lamellae, creating irregularities and eventually bursting
them. Because defoamers are by design incompatible with the solution, they must not
be included unnecessarily or in excess. Excessive amounts of defoamers can cause
issues both in storage and in the final coated product. Ladder studies are therefore
needed to ensure that an optimal amount of defoamer is added to the formulation
(Goldschmidt & Streitberger, 2018).

4.7.

Structure-property relationships

Binders are the polymer particles that form the film on the surface. The binder
determines the mechanical properties of the coating during all stages of its life. There
are several demands placed on the final properties of any modern wood coating,
especially exterior coatings, and it is by tuning the binder these demands can be met.
For example, the binder needs to have good enough weather stability, the right ratio
between elasticity and hardness, good adhesion while retaining sufficient blocking
resistance, sufficient blushing resistance, good water repellency, and so on. All these
demands must be met while remaining low on VOC and being economically viable
to produce.
In acrylic binders, these properties are achieved through the careful formulation of
the recipe and the reaction technique, allowing the control of several parameters,
including polarity, glass transition temperature (Tg), surfactant amount and type,
particle size, morphology, and more. The control of these parameters is of great
importance, especially in the case of wood coatings since wood as a construction
material requires careful protection against the environment and the life forms
therein. The complex structure of wood puts further demands on the binder, as it
must be able to penetrate the wood structure to provide enough adhesion and
sufficient protection to the wood (Baumstark & Tiarks, 2002).
22

André Båssar

4.7.1. Particle size and distribution

Particle size and distribution are important properties in any latex as they determine
the usability of the end product. For example, the particle size will affect the
rheology of the dispersion which in turn determines how to apply the coating.
Particle size in wood coatings also impact how deep the particles will penetrate into
the wood.
Distribution of the particle size varies between different latexes. Particle sizes within
an emulsion might be monodisperse, bimodal or multimodal. The length of the
nucleation period in relation to the length of the entire reaction is the determining
factor in the distribution of particle sizes. (Anderson & Daniels, 2003).
Most emulsions for wood coatings have particle sizes ranging from 5 nm to 1000 nm
and can therefore be called colloidal dispersions. There are exceptions with
extraordinarily small or large particle sizes outside of this range but these are no
longer colloids (Poth & Müller, 2011).

4.7.2. Core-shell binders

In most cases, the Tg of the binder is the factor that determines the film formation
temperature (MFFT), final hardness and elasticity of the formed film. Higher Tg
means lower elasticity and harder film, while lower Tg means the opposite. For wood
coatings a Tg of between 0 to 10 oC is usually preferred. Here lies a problem,
acylates with such a low Tg do not in turn give the final film enough blocking
resistance to be an ideal wood coating. These properties can be tuned by
crosslinking, but this solution is often expensive and can also have other adverse
effects on other film properties.
Another solution is to create a binder with a core-shell morphology. This means that
several polymers are present in the dispersion at once but separated into different
23

André Båssar
phases. For wood coatings a soft polymer with a low Tg in the core provides the
elasticity and wanted film properties, while a hard shell containing a high Tg
polymer acts as a high blocking resistance barrier. By changing the ratio between
core and shell, and monomer compositions in both, one can fine-tune the Tg and
final film properties of the binder (Baumstark & Tiarks, 2002).

4.7.3. Blocking resistance

One issue in industrial coating is the stacking of coated wood onto each other or
other surfaces. The term blocking refers to coated surfaces being in contact and
under load, for example stacked on each other, causing unwanted adhesion.
Sufficient blocking resistance means that after a reasonable amount of time has
passed, the coated surfaces should be able to be stacked on top of each other without
being damaged when separated (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 6 - Properties of Wood
Coatings – Testing and Characterisation, 2009).
Achieving a sufficiently elastic and simultaneously blocking resistant wood coat by
only varying the monomer types and ratios is nearly impossible. The industrial way
of solving this issue is either to introduce cross-linking agents or by changing the
morphology of the particles, e.g. the earlier mentioned core-shell dispersions (Prieto
& Kiene, 2018).

5. Coloring
The color and finish of a wooden construction is an important element for how
people experience the building. Gloss levels also range from matte to very glossy and
the combination of gloss and color must be decided at the design stage of any new
construction. Older buildings, found in so-called “old towns”, had coats that aged
considerably with time, changing the gloss and tone along with it. Newer coats have
24

André Båssar
considerably improved in this area with better application techniques and improved
pigments, leading to a uniform and protective coat, but at the cost of the charm of the
living old towns (Arnkil, 2013).

5.1.

Wood stains

Wood stains are the coatings of choice when the goal is to darken the wood while
keeping an emphasis on the grain. A wood stain has a lower solid content than most
other coatings, at around 20%. To provide sufficient protection, the components of
the wood stain must penetrate deep into the wood. Solvent-borne wood stains
accomplish this more easily due to their waterborne counterparts causing swelling of
the wood. To accomplish similar penetration in a waterborne wood stain, the binder’s
particle size should be small and the amount of binder in the formulation should also
be kept as low as possible while providing enough stability for the pigments.
While wood stains do incorporate fungicides and preservatives in their formulation,
some application methods, such as normal brushing, will not apply enough pressure
for the stain to penetrate deep into the wood. This means that the preservatives will
remain on the surface and, if subjected to harsh weather conditions, may be washed
away or simply be insufficient. In cases like this, pre-treating the wood with
preservatives before applying the wood stain is needed (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter
7 - Market Needs and End Uses (1) – Architectural (Decorative) Wood Coatings,
2009).

5.2.

Organic dyes

Dyes are soluble colorants that can be incorporated into a coating formulation. In the
wood coating industry, most dyes are synthetic organic dyes originally used in the

25

André Båssar
textile industry. Some common dyes used in wood stains are acid dyes and metal
complex dyes (Prieto & Kiene, 2018).
Acid dyes are, as their name suggests, applied under acidic conditions. The main
advantages of acid dyes are ease of application and a wide choice of colors. Within
the category of acid dyes, they are further categorized based on the fastness
properties, pH and migration of the dye. The different types of acid dyes require
specific application methods and cannot be combined with each other (Richards,
2012).
Metal complex dyes are acid dyes with a metal atom incorporated into the structure.
The ratio of metal to dye usually ranges from 1:1 to 1:2. Similarly to acid dyes, the
metal complex dyes will require different application methods depending on this
ratio. Compared to acid dyes, the metal complex dyes feature greater fastness while
losing some brightness (Richards, 2012).

5.3.

Pigments

Pigments are split into organic and inorganic pigments. Organic pigments are
hydrophobic and offer a wider range of colors with greater saturation compared to
inorganic pigments. They do however require complex synthesis, which makes them
significantly more expensive than inorganic pigments. Inorganic pigments, while
cheaper, are also denser and more opaque. They are also hydrophilic and have low
surface energy, which necessitates a larger amount of inorganic pigment in a
formulation, which in turn can lead to wetting and stability issues.
Although the main function of any pigment is to add color to the coating, they also
provide several other positive improvements. Pigments protect both the coating and
the underlying surface from UV-light and, in some cases, even infrared heat, which
could be useful during industrial drying. Some pigments, such as the industry staple
titanium dioxide, can even provide fire retardant properties.

26

André Båssar
Controlling the properties of the pigment is very important since the physical
properties of the pigment will affect how the coating performs during storage,
application, and as a coated surface. All extra molecules in a coating formulation can
affect the stability and coating properties of the product, and sufficient compatibility
between the pigment and the formulation must be ensured. The particle size and
distribution of the pigment also influence the optical properties of the coated product,
as the hue of the color shifts depending on these variables. Analyzing the refractive
index of the pigment is important in transparent coatings since a mixture of binder
and pigment with similar refractive indexes will seem more transparent to the human
eye (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 4 - Raw Materials for Wood Coatings (2) –
Solvents, Additives and Colorants, 2009).

5.4.

Volatile organic compounds, VOC

Volatile organic compounds or VOC are, according to ISO: ‘any organic liquid
and/or solid that evaporates spontaneously at the prevailing temperature and pressure
of the atmosphere with which it is in contact’ (International Organization for
Standardization, 2014). Solvent-borne coatings having more VOC have been
mentioned several times in this thesis. Since the solvent is designed to evaporate to
allow the coating to form a film, a solvent being an organic liquid would then be a
VOC per se. In the past, this was not a problem since coating quality and ease of
application were the main criteria for a successful coating product. Due to stricter
regulations on VOC, the need for lower amounts of solvent is clear.
Waterborne coatings have taken over the market largely because using water as a
solvent eliminates the VOC issue in its entirety. Broadly speaking this is true, but
most coatings are not simply a mixture of polymers and solvent, they also include
other additives and pigments, which in turn introduce VOC back into the
formulation. Mineral spirits and formaldehyde are examples of common ingredients
in many pigments, and the VOC levels must be calculated when using such additives,
so as not to exceed the current legal limits. Good practice is to always try to reduce
the VOC content in any coating product, if not for environmental reasons alone, then
27

André Båssar
for future-proofing the product against ever-stricter EU regulations (Prieto & Kiene,
2018).

6. Flame retardant wood
While wood has many advantages as a construction material, such as versatility,
sustainability, and overall appearance, its flammability and contribution as fuel to an
ongoing fire holds wood back from its fullest potential as the construction material of
choice for any new building. While increased interest in wood as a construction
material has been noted due to the rise in environmentally sustainable solutions, there
are restrictions concerning flammability and ignitability placed on any construction
material used for industrial or commercial construction, and this includes wood. To
meet these demands flame retardant coatings and systems are being continuously
developed to suppress the flammability of wood to a degree that is acceptable in
modern society (Mariappan, 2017).

6.1.

Different flame retardant systems

Combustion of wood is a three-stage process taking place in both the gaseous and the
solid phase. In the first stage, water will evaporate by absorbing heat in an
endothermic process. Only when the moisture content of the wood approaches zero
will the temperature of the wood itself rise above 100 °C.
When all the water has been evaporated, the temperature rises sharply and volatile
gases are produced. This second stage can further be divided into primary and
secondary combustion. Primary combustion, ranging from 280 °C to 480 °C, will
release large amounts of energy and unburned gases, as large molecules start to
decompose into char. A large amount of the potential heat in wood is contained in
these gases. As temperatures continue to rise above 500 °C, the reaction reaches
secondary combustion, and the gases start to combust.
28

André Båssar
After all the gases have been driven from the wood, stage three begins. During this
stage, the remaining carbon chains of cellulose and lignin will continue to burn
slowly as charcoal. This stage has a much lower heat output compared to the second
stage but can continue for a long time depending on oxygen supply (Garrett, 1981),
(Iwuozor, 2019).
Flame retardants work by changing the parameters of this process to limit the
combustion process in favor of other reactions. Important factors that can be
influenced by flame retardants are time to ignition, heat release rate, mass loss,
smoke release rate, flame spread rate and fire resistance. They must also be non-toxic
and non-harmful to humans and the environment before combustion and preferably
also during combustion. The flame retardants must also be stable during storage and
when coated, as many otherwise effective flame retardants are prone to crystalizing
on the coated surface or leaching, especially under moist outdoor conditions
(Popescu & Pfriem, 2019).

6.1.1. Halogen-based flame retardants

Halogen-based flame retardants are widely available and used in many flame
retardant wood coatings today. These types of flame retardants most often act in the
gas phase as free radical scavengers. Which means that they bond with the free
radicals created by the combustion of wood and, therefore, slow down the reaction
kinetics.
Flame retardants based on halogens have long been known to be an effective and
cheap solution but have recently been losing ground to other solutions, since they
have been identified as widespread environmental contaminates that can be found in
alarmingly high and increasing concentrations in human tissue, including blood, fat
tissue and breast milk, as well as wildlife from Europe, Japan, North America and
even Artic regions. In addition, during combustion the brominated flame retardants
will release toxic and corrosive substances that persist in the environment and that
are harmful to all life (Popescu & Pfriem, 2019), (Janssen, 2005).
29

André Båssar

6.1.2. Salt-based flame retardants

Inorganic salts are often used in synergy with other flame retardants in a coating
formulation. These salts, phosphates, sulfates, hydroxides, and carbonates offer
thermal stability and low smoke release while being environmentally sustainable.
They are, however, highly soluble in water which limits their use for outdoor
coatings, and as standalone flame retardants the load required to achieve sufficient
fire retardancy to pass various fire tests is too high.
Different salts may provide different flame retardant properties. Some common
compounds used in flame retardants are magnesium hydroxide and calcium
carbonate. During combustion, these compounds will decompose endothermically,
absorbing heat and releasing water and/or CO2. This will inhibit the combustion
process while releasing no toxic material into the environment (Tang, et al., 2017).

6.1.3. Boron-based flame retardants

Boron-based flame retardants are another widely used flame retardant solution.
Boron compounds have high thermal resistance, however, they have also been
included in the list of Substances of Very High Concern within the EU (European
Chemicals Agency, 2010). A boron-based system is often made by combining boric
acid and sodium borate, as both compounds flame retardant properties complement
each other.
Boric acid will increase dehydration of cellulose leading to increased charring and
lower VOC emissions. Sodium borate will instead work to reduce the spread of the
fire. Borium salts can also be used and work by releasing water while also enhancing
dehydration of cellulose. Boron-based compounds also create a protective layer on

30

André Båssar
the wood surface when exposed to high heat. These compounds have also been
combined with other flame retardants with good results (Popescu & Pfriem, 2019).

6.1.4. Phosphorous-based flame retardants

Phosphorous-based flame retardants are a promising alternative to replace the
halogen-based systems in use today. These compounds, like in the case of halogens,
can act in the gas phase as radical scavengers, or in the condensed phase, by
promoting charring and slowing down the pyrolysis, or even insulating the material
to a point of self-extinguishing (Schartel, 2010).
Flame retardants based on phosphorus compounds may be partially toxic and can by
themselves be irritating, or even dangerous, to vulnerable individuals. These
compounds also raise the moisture content of the wood, increasing the need for
biocides and fungicides, which in turn might contain VOC (Popescu & Pfriem,
2019).

6.1.5. Nitrogen-based flame retardants

Melamine C3H6N6 is the most commonly used nitrogen-based flame retardant. Upon
sublimation, at around 350 °C, melamine will endothermically absorb large amounts
of heat. When the temperature rises further, melamine will decompose several times,
eliminating ammonia at each step and acting endothermically.
Melamine can also be combined with phosphates, where the intumescent properties
of the phosphorous, and the endothermic effects of the melamine, work together to
effectively suppress the combustion reaction. The disadvantage to using nitrogenbased flame retardants is the release of ammonium into the environment, as well as
some ammonium salts being potentially toxic (Laoutid, Bonnaud, Alexandre, LopezCuesta, & Dubois, 2009)
31

André Båssar

6.1.6. Silicon-based flame retardants

Silicon-based flame retardants work by forming a protective layer of silica on the
wood surface, isolating it from heat. These types of compounds can be combined
with phosphorous-based flame retardants to enhance the intumescent properties of
both. Combinations with other flame retardant systems, such as boronic acid, have
also shown great promise. Silicon-based flame retardants are environmentally
sustainable and are therefore an attractive alternative as an enhancing additive to
other flame retardant systems (Popescu & Pfriem, 2019).

6.1.7. Nanocomposite-based flame retardants

Nanocomposites have been proven to protect the oxidation of the char structure in
combusting wood. This property alone is not enough to provide sufficient
suppression of the combustion reaction, but the small particle sizes of
nanocomposites mean that very low concentrations can be added together with other
flame retardant systems to enhance their properties. Nanosized versions of silicates,
titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide have all been shown to promote the flame
retardant properties of wood (Popescu & Pfriem, 2019).

6.2.

Fire standards for wood

In industrial wood coatings, there are always standards that must be met. Especially
when the matter at hand is flame retardancy, the ability to prove a coatings efficiency
is essential since failure could result in death. In Europe, these standards are EN ISO
32

André Båssar
1182, EN 13823 and EN ISO 11925-2. Combined, these standards are used to
classify the flammability of any wooden construction material in accordance to the
EU standard EN 13501-1 (The British Standard, 2007). In a laboratory, a cone
calorimeter can also be used to analyze the combustion properties of a small wood
sample.

6.2.1. Cone calorimeter

A cone calorimeter is used to study the combustion properties of a small sample,
such as a coated wood piece. The sample is placed on a scale and subjected to a set
heat flux, most often 35 kW/m2 or 50 kW/m2. During the test, the machine will
continuously measure heat release, smoke release, mass loss, CO and CO2 levels and
other gases, as well as the time to ignition and total flame time (Rowell &
Dietenberger, 2012). This gives a quick insight into the efficiency of the flame
retardants, especially if there are references to other flame retardants that have passed
the standardized testing of the EU.

6.2.2. Combustability testing

Non-combustibility testing is done to show whether a test piece is combustible. A
test piece 45 mm in diameter and 50 mm high is placed into a cylindrical furnace at
750 °C. The temperatures of the furnace, on the surface of the test piece as well as
the center of the test piece, are continuously measured. The duration of visible flames
as well as mass loss of the test piece are also noted. For a test piece to be noncombustible it must fulfill three criteria: The furnace temperature should not rise
more than 50 °C, the mean duration of visible flames should not exceed 20 seconds
and the average mass loss should not be more than 50% of the original sample
(International Organization for Standardization, 2010)

6.2.3. Single burn item test

Single burn item test, or SBI, is an important test to pass for coated wooden
materials. SBI tests are used to determine the fire hazard of all non-floor construction
materials. A specimen consisting of two walls no thicker than 200 mm, one
measuring 500 mm x 1500 mm and the other 1000 mm x 1500 mm, are attached into
an L-shape. The constructed corner wall is then exposed to a propane burner placed
at the bottom of the corner with a heat output of 30.7 kW. Once the burner is on, the
sample will be continuously analyzed for 20 minutes where heat release, smoke
production and total volume flow will be measure automatically. Additionally, flame
spread and falling flame drops will be observed visually (The British Standard, 2010)

6.2.4. Ignitability test

Ignitability is tested by attaching a 250 mm x 90 mm test piece to a specimen holder.
This test piece is subjected to a propane gas flame of 20 mm at an angle of 45°.
Depending on the classification sought after, the flame application time is varied
from 15 seconds to 30 seconds. A filter paper is placed below to ignite in case of any
falling debris. The test measures the flame spread, and visually observes the
occurrence of flaming or glowing on the test piece (International Organization for
Standardization, 2020).

Durability of coatings

Treating a piece of wood with flame retardant coating will surely better the results in
flame retardant related testing. But merely passing flame retardant standards shortly
after coating is not enough for a product that is likely to be subject to the
environment for ten years or more. Therefore, there is a need to test how these coated
products perform after being subjected to humid conditions and UV-light for
prolonged periods of time.
There are two recognized methods of accelerating the weathering for durability
testing. In the first method the test specimens are subjected to one-week cycles of 96
hours of water followed by 72 hours of drying, repeated for twelve weeks. The
second method is a 24-hour cycle of 4 hours of wetting followed by 4 hours of
drying, repeated once for 16 hours total, followed by 8 hours of rest. This cycle is
then repeated for 1000 hours.
After the weathering is completed, the test pieces are subjected to the same flame
retardant tests that gave them their original flame retardant classifications. Since
SBI-tests require a large construction to be carried out, this classification can be
verified using a cone calorimeter (European Committee for Standardization, 2014)

7. Methods of analysis
7.1.

Solid content

Gravimetric analysis was used to measure the solid content of the polymer
dispersions. A diamond weighing boat measuring 85 mm by 65 mm was weighed
when empty and its weight noted. Samples of ca 2 grams were pipetted onto the
weighing boat and left to evaporate. When all the water had evaporated, the weighing
boat was weighed again, and the mass loss noted. Dividing the mass of the resulting
film by the original sample mass and multiplying by 100 yields the total solid content
35

André Båssar
percentage of the sample. This was done twice for each dispersion and the total
evaporation of water was verified using ATR-FTIR.

7.2.

FTIR analysis

To confirm that all the monomers have reacted in the emulsion polymerization and to
verify that all the water has evaporated from the film used for solid content analysis,
FTIR analysis was used, specifically, ATR-FTIR - Attenuated Total Reflectance
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. An infrared beam is shot at a transparent
crystal with a high refractive index in contact with the sample film. The sample will
alter the wave which then bounces back into the spectrometer’s detector and is used
to generate an infrared spectrum (Gregoriou, 2000).

7.3.

Glass transition temperature

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the glass transition
temperature of the polymer dispersions. This is a thermoanalytical analysis method
in which a small sample of ca 5 mg is cut from the solid film obtained during the
solid content analysis. The sample is placed into a pan and placed into the DSC along
with an empty reference pan. For this analysis, a set Heat-Cool-Heat program in
which the samples are heated to 100 °C, cooled to -40 °C and reheated back to 100
°C with a speed of 10 °C per minute was used. The heat flow required to keep the
sample heated at the same rate as the reference pan is measured, and the glass
transition temperature is obtained from the inflection point of the curve.

7.4.

Particle size

Particle size was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS using dynamic light
scattering. The polymer dispersion samples were diluted with ionized water to 2%
solid content and a sample was placed in a disposable cuvette custom made for the
Zetasizer. A laser passes through the solution and measures the scattering of light as
a function of time. Due to Brownian motion, smaller particles will diffuse faster than
larger particles, the link between light scattering and particle size is used to calculate
the particle size of the solution (Raval, et al., 2019).

7.5.

Zeta potential

Zeta potential was also measured using the Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS but using
Laser Doppler Micro-electrophoresis. The polymer dispersion samples were further
diluted to 0.5% solid content and pipetted into appropriate cuvettes. An electric field
is applied to the sample, which will initiate movement of the dispersed particles in
relation to their zeta potential. By measuring the velocity of the particles, the
Zetasizer can then calculate the zeta potential of the sample.
The goal of the analysis is to measure the effect on zeta potential when adding a salt
to the diluted dispersions. Samples of the diluted dispersions were therefore
thoroughly mixed with different amounts of salt, the resulting mixtures were
analyzed in the Zetasizer and the results were compared to each other.

7.6.

Defoamer efficiency analysis

To analyze the efficiency and viability of defoamers, an original test method had to
be created. The method was based on the British Standard (The British Standard,
2002). A 200 ml beaker was filled with 50 g of polymer dispersion and a set amount
37

André Båssar
of defoamer was added. A bladed stirrer was applied at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes after
which 35 g was poured into a 100 ml glass cylinder. The volume of the dispersion
was measured continuously for 15 minutes. Knowing the volume and mass in
relation to time, the density can be calculated as a function of time.
The mixtures were then bottled and left to stand for two weeks. During this time, the
samples were visually examined for any signs of separation of flocculation. Any
sample that passed the two-week stability requirement was retested using the same
test method as before. The results were then compared to the initial test results.

7.7.

Cone calorimeter analysis

To analyze the fire retardant properties of wood coatings, a cone calorimeter was
used. Coated wood samples of approximately 10x10x2 cm were placed at a distance
of 25 mm from the cone. The cone was then heated to around 700°C to produce a
heat flux of 35 kW/m2 on the wood surface. An igniter assists in igniting the wood
sample and the time to ignition is noted. During the time between ignition and flame
out several variables such as heat release rate, effective heat of combustion and total
smoke production are continuously measured.

8. Performing the emulsion polymerization
The polymer dispersion is an acrylic polymer dispersion based on two monomers,
here referred to as monomer A and monomer B. Three different surfactants were also
used, referred to as surfactant X, Y and Z. Furthermore, several additives which will
not be named were used in different stages of the reaction. A solution of initiator and
water is used to initiate the polymerization reaction.

38

André Båssar
Every emulsion polymerization was performed in a fume hood, using a 500 ml glass
reactor vessel and accompanying glass lid with 5 necks. The lid was sealed and
securely tightened to avoid any evaporation. A reflux condenser and thermometer
were fitted through the necks, as well as two input tubes and a stirrer. The monomer
and initiator solutions were fed to the reactor using two mechanical pumps. A
circulating bath pumped heated water through the reactor vessel’s walls to maintain
the temperature of the reactor.
First, two surfactants are mixed with water and additives and added to the reactor.
The temperature is set to 80°C and the stirrer to 200 rpm. While this mixture is
heating, two other mixtures are prepared. In one beaker the two monomers are
combined with an additive and in another the initiator is mixed with water. These
mixtures are left to stir while the temperature in the reactor rises. When the
temperature has reached 80°C, the reaction is initiated by adding some of the
monomer mix and initiator solution to the reactor. This starts the polymerization of
the monomers and creates the base on which all further polymerization reactions will
occur. The initial reaction is allowed to proceed for 15 minutes after which the rest of
the monomer mix and initiator solution is added slowly, during 4 to 5 hours. When
both the initiator solution and monomer mix beakers have been emptied, an additive
is added to the reactor and the temperature raised to 90°C for 45 minutes, to ensure
the complete reaction of all monomers. Finally, the temperature is lowered to 40°C
after which the product is filtered, and its pH adjusted to 8 using an ammonia
solution.
It was observed that a simple emulsion polymerization did not achieve sufficient film
properties and the recipe was adjusted to a core-shell type emulsion polymerization
to allow for greater control of the Tg and therefore the film properties. Recipes can
be found in Appendix A.

9. Results and discussion
The purpose of this thesis was to study fire retardant waterborne wood coatings and
the challenges involved with their manufacturing and use.

9.1.

Synthesis and characterization of acrylic binders

In wood coatings the penetration of the binder is largely dependent on the particle
size of said binder (Bulian & Graystone, Chapter 7 - Market Needs and End Uses (1)
– Architectural (Decorative) Wood Coatings, 2009). Another important factor is Tg
which correlates to the MFFT, often being a few degrees higher than the
corresponding MFFT. Any coating must have a low enough Tg to allow film
formation in the temperature range where it will be applied, but still high enough to
give sufficient film hardness (Jones, Nichols, & Pappas, 2017).
The goal was to synthesize a binder with a lower Tg and particle size that would
simultaneously provide high storage stability and colloidal stability even in the
presence of electrolytes. Monomers were chosen based on the requirements of the
final product.

homogeneous particles, after which the strategy shifted to core-shell type of
polymerization as can be noted by the name changing to CSx. No further testing was
done on the B-range, as well as the visually lackluster CS1 and CS2, which explains
the lack of Tg values.
By changing the ratio of core to shell and the ratio of monomer A to monomer B in
both core and shell, the Tg value could be optimized. CS6 and CS6Z produced
visually uniform films, while the films of CS5 and CS7 both had minor defects but
were still used in further analysis. This indicated that a core to shell ratio of 80:20
was optimal. As CS5 had minor defects, the recipe for CS6 softened the core which
raised the Tg and resulted in a uniform film. In CS7 the core was softened further to
compensate for a harder shell, but the film forming properties immediately
deteriorated. Such a hard shell seemed to hinder the film forming even if
compensated for in the core. It was determined that CS6 was the optimal recipe and
CS6Z was promptly synthesized analyze the effect of changing the anionic surfactant
to another. Appendix B shows the DSC analysis of CS6.

9.1.1. Zetasizer analysis

One goal was to lower the particle size of the binders. To see if this was
accomplished the binders were analyzed using DLS, the results are shown in Table
9.2 and Appendix C.

As is clear from Table 9.2, all synthesized binders had lower particle size compared
to the provided commercial binder. Using surfactant Z raised the particle size
41

André Båssar
compared to the original CS6 based on surfactant X, but this was still an
improvement over A0. Every synthesized binder was close to 100 nm in particle size,
which is widely used in binders for exterior use (Friel, 1995).
For the purpose of the industrial partner, the binder needs to retain its colloidal
stability when mixed with large amounts of salt. One milliliter diluted sample of
every binder was mixed with increasing amounts of the salt N and the samples zeta
potential was measured in the zetasizer. The amount of salt N needed to reach the
cutoff point of -25 mV can be found plotted in appendix D and estimated below in
Table 9.3. To ease in understanding, the results have been converted as if the solid
content of the binder was 30%.

While zeta potential is not a definitive tool for measuring colloidal stability, the
results strongly indicate that the synthesized binders are more resistant to salts than
their commercial counterpart. Surfactant Z negatively impacted the salt resistance
compared to the surfactant X-based binders.
The goal of developing a superior binder for was accomplished. Binders CS6 and
CS6Z both had appropriate film properties and Tg for wood coating use, but
surfactant X-based CS6 yielded greater results in the particle size and zeta potential
analyzes. CS6 also had similar results to CS5 and CS7 in these tests. It was therefore
concluded that CS6 was the optimal recipe for the purpose of this thesis.

9.2.

Defoamer optimization

One issue most waterborne wood coatings face is foaming. Foaming can cause issues
during application, especially in industrial application when the rate of application is
high and the machinery is automatic and depends on consistent flow rates. While
42

André Båssar
surfactants are needed for multiple purposes, they often increase the amount of
foaming. One way to reduce excessive foaming in coatings is by adding defoamers
or surface modifiers. The purpose of this part of the thesis was to find a suitable
defoamer.
Five different products, three defoamers and two surface modifiers, were added to
the recipe in various amounts and the effect on foaming was observed. The results
are presented as density over time in grams per milliliter compared to a reference
sample of non-defoamed product. Defoamers are referred to as DF-1, 2 and 3, while
surface modifiers are referred to as SM-1 and SM-2.
All additives reduced the amount of foaming when added to the product. The bigger
challenge was long-term stability. The product contains large amounts of salt which,
negatively impacts the long-term stability of most colloidal systems. Further
modifying the surface properties of such a product could push the system over the
edge into instability. This was seen during the study as four out of five additives did
not pass the two-week stability test when added even at very low amounts.
DF-2, when added at levels below those specified in the technical data sheet, did
remain stable during storage while still improving the foaming properties. When the
tests were redone after two weeks, the defoaming capabilities had not deteriorated.
The optimal amount of DF-2 was determined to be ca 0.15% by weight, as this
showed similar results as 0.5% which in turn separated in storage. It was also
determined that adding as low as 0.05% of DF-2 had a noticeable impact on foaming
and could be considered for non-industrial applications. Density over time for
various levels of DF-2 can be seen in Appendix E, the other additives are omitted as
none were stable in storage.

9.3.

Cone calorimeter analysis

During the thesis, several cone calorimeter analyses were performed as an indicative
test to see how a specific formula impacted the fire properties of wood. Coated wood
pieces measuring 10x10x2 cm were analyzed. By comparing the results of these tests
43

André Båssar
with wood pieces coated by the reference product, one can gain insight into how
various additives impact the flame retardant properties of the reference coating. The
additives tested were FR1, 2 and 3 as well as a mix of FR1 and FR2, all added to the
reference product totaling 0.5% of active substance.

As can be seen from Table 9.4 all additives improved the flame retardant properties
compared to the reference product. FR1 and FR2 yielded the lowest peak of heat
release rate and similar results throughout the analysis, while their mixture produced
worse results. Smoke production was significantly lower in the case of FR3
compared to all others. Since gaining a specific flame retardant certification requires
low values in several of these categories these results help in choosing the right
additive to add to a formula needing to improve its heat release or smoke release
properties.
While these results give a clear indication that flame retardant properties improve by
adding these additives, inconsistencies are a fact due to the varying properties of
different wood pieces. The results may therefore not be fully conclusive as the
inherent variations in composition in the wood samples that were burned could have
impacted the results. Therefore, these results should be used only as a guideline until
further SBI testing is performed. Another important aspect to take into consideration
when adding any additive to a formula is the ease of incorporation that may vary
from additive to additive. One additive that produces great results could cause
difficulties in storage, during mixing or after application that is not noted by cone

44

André Båssar
calorimeter testing but should be taken into consideration when choosing which
additive to use.

10. Conclusions
Wood-based constructions are gaining popularity and regulations are opening doors
for new types of wood constructions. While Finland has long had a trend of wooden
constructions in personal households, wooden multistory constructions and industrial
constructions are increasingly being made out of wood (Toppinen, Röhr, Pätäri,
Lähtinen, & Toivonen, 2018). This combined with the global trend of sustainability
creates a demand on new, sustainable flame retardant wood coatings. This thesis has
studied the challenges in creating such a coating and furthered the understanding of
several challenges faced in developing environmentally friendly flame retardant
coatings for wood.
Acrylic core-shell type of emulsions having small particle sizes that exhibit high
stabilities even in the presence of electrolytes have been successfully synthesized.
The optimized emulsion showed good film properties having suitable Tgs for use in
wood coatings. As for the CS6 emulsion, while promising, further studying is
nonetheless needed. Its behavior when used in actual coating production, as well as
drying properties, wood penetration and weather stability is still unknown.
Another part of the thesis was to find a suitable defoamer for a given dispersion. A
test method was developed and used to test five different additives. The challenging
composition of the product makes the addition of surface modifying additives
challenging. Out of the five additives, only one was found to be stable, and only
when added at very small amounts. Defoaming capabilities at this range was
however acceptable and a viable option for defoaming the product was found. The
commercial market of defoamers can change in the future, and there is no guarantee
for the price and availability of the suitable defoamer. Further studies to find other
alternatives could lower the cost, improve performance, or provide a sense of
security for the future.
45

André Båssar
Cone calorimeter analysis was done on several coated wood samples with the goal of
determining the viability of different flame retardant additives. All additives
improved flame retardant performance compared to the reference coated samples.
While the results of FR-1 and FR-2 were different from FR-3, the magnitude or even
existence of this difference is not certain since the wood properties themselves could
have been a significant factor. Although not conclusive, the results clearly show that
all additives had improved performance over non-additive containing coating. In the
case of these additives, the decision on which one to use should instead of
performance fall on pricing, availability, and ease of use. To gain more conclusive
results, the analysis would need more samples and for the coating to be carefully
applied on more uniform wood samples.

Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Utmaningar med flamskyddande träbeläggning

Trä har alltid varit ett viktigt byggnadsmaterial både för hus och verktyg. Genom
historiens gång, fram till att mänskligheten utvecklats till det vi ser idag, har träet
alltid varit med oss. Med en allt större fokus på hållbarhet och miljövänlighet har
intresset av trä som en lösning på framtidens hållbarhetsproblem ökat drastiskt.
EU sätter stor press på dess medlemsländer att minska på sina koldioxidutsläpp i
framtiden. Nutidens kunskap om trä och dess egenskaper öppnar nya dörrar för att
lösa detta problem. En sådan lösning vore att använda trä som byggnadsmaterial i
större byggen och höghus. För att möjliggöra detta måste säkerheten säkerställas,
detta innebär att byggnader av trä måste hålla samma standarder som sådana som
byggts av andra byggnadsmaterial.
Olika träprodukter har utvecklats för att möta dessa behov. Glulam kan byta ut stora
stödjande balkar som traditionellt byggs av metall, medan OSB idag äger 75% av
marknaden för huspaneler. Det alla träprodukter har gemensamt är att de behöver
beläggas för att skydda träet från miljön och skydda träet från eld. För att
åstadkomma detta används träbeläggningar.
Träbeläggningar kan kategoriseras utgående ifrån hur beläggningens alla byggstenar
är utspädda. Lösningsmedelsbaserade beläggningar, där byggstenarna är utspädda i
ett lösningsmedel, har varit det alternativ som erbjudit bäst prestanda. När
beläggningen torkar och bildar en film kommer lösningsmedlet att evaporera, vilket i
en lösningsmedelsbaserad beläggning innebär utsläpp i miljön. På grund av detta har
det andra alternativet, nämligen vattenbaserade beläggningar, vuxit i popularitet. Det
ökade fokuset på vattenbaserade beläggningar har snabbt förbättrat prestandan i
dessa produkter och idag hittas vattenbaserade beläggningar med liknande prestanda
som sina lösningsmedelsbaserade motsvarigheter.
De flesta vattenbaserade beläggningarna består till del av ett bindemedel gjort med
hjälp av emulsionspolymerisation. En emulsionspolymerisation är en kontrollerbar
reaktion som producerar en slutprodukt bestående av olösliga polymerpartiklar
47

André Båssar
utspädda i vatten. Reaktionen kan styras för att ändra på egenskaperna hos dessa
partiklar och därmed egenskaperna hos emulsionen och slutligen beläggningen. För
en lyckad träbeläggning måste flera egenskaper tas i beaktande. Beläggningen måste
penetrera tillräckligt djupt in i träet och där bilda en stark men ändå elastisk film.
Filmen måste skydda mot väder, mikrober och i många fall eld.
En emulsionspolymerisation består av tre intervaller. I det första intervallet blandas
en vattenlösning med surfaktanter till en nivå över den kritiska
micellkoncentrationen (eng. critical micelle concentration). Detta innebär att miceller
med mycket stor ytarea existerar i lösningen. Monomerer samt en initiator adderas
sedan till lösningen. Initiatorn kommer att radikalisera monomererna som i sin tur
binder sig till micellerna. Reaktionen fortskrider tills alla miceller antingen
transformerats till polymerer eller används för att stabilisera andra polymerer.
När det första skedet framskridit till sin slutpunkt kommer resterande monomerer att
binda sig själv till polymererna som skapades i steg ett. Det betyder alltså att det
första skedet är den avgörande faktorn i hur många polymerer som kommer att finnas
i slutprodukten. Då största delen av monomererna har reagerat kommer reaktionen
att påbörja terminering och reaktionshastigheten sakta minska tills inga monomerer
finns kvar och reaktionshastigheten nått noll.
I denna avhandling utfördes flera sådana emulsionspolymerisationer med målet att
utveckla ett bindemedel med bra egenskaper för flamskyddande träbeläggning. De
egenskaper som eftersträvades var en låg partikelstorlek, glasomvandlingstemperatur
mellan 0 och 10°C, och hög stabilitet även när den blandas med salt. Snabbt
upptäcktes det att en kärna–skal-struktur (eng. core-shell) behövdes för att
tillfredsställa dessa krav. Sammanlagt syntetiserades tio olika emulsioner med olika
förhållanden mellan kärna och skal, samt olika monomerproportioner i både kärnan
och skalet. Genom analys med FTIR, DSC, DLS, LDE hittades ett optimalt recept.
Detta recept syntetiserades även med en annan stabiliserande surfaktant, men utan
förbättring. Det optimala receptet kallades CS6 och hade en partikelstorlek på 89 nm,
Tg på 4°C och bildade fina filmer under torkning. Jämfört med ett kommersiellt
referensbindemedel påvisade även CS6 elektrostatisk stabilitet vid högre mängder
salt. Emulsionernas recept och analys hittas i Appendix A till D.

Skumdämpande av träbeläggningar undersöktes i denna avhandling. Skum kan
orsaka stora problem vid applikation av träbeläggningar, speciellt vid industriell
applikation där appliceringshastigheterna är höga och processen automatiserad. För
att minska skumbildningen kan skumdämpare tillsättas till beläggningens recept.
Dessa skumdämpare är små olösliga droppar som attackerar bubblornas lameller och
spräcker dem. Eftersom skumdämpare på grund av deras funktion måste vara
olösliga kan de skapa problem både vid applikation, lagring och på ytan av den
slutliga produkten. Därför är det viktigt att mängden skumdämpare hålls så låg som
möjligt.
För att hitta en passande lösning utvecklades en testmetod för att utvärdera olika
skumdämpares och ytmodifierares prestanda och lagringsstabilitet. Additivämnen i
olika mängd lades till ett bindemedel och utsattes för omrörning under en bestämd
tid. Efter omrörningen mättes blandningens densitet under 15 minuter, där en högre
viskositet innebar mindre skum. Blandningarna lagrades i två veckor varefter de
blandningar som fortfarande var stabila utsattes för samma omrörning igen och
resultaten jämfördes med de första resultaten. Av de fem analyserade additiverna var
det endast ett ämne, DF-2, som klarade lagringskravet. DF-2 uppvisade inga defekter
under längre lagring och hade dessutom en minskande effekt på skum även när det
adderades i väldigt låg andel. Resultaten hölls även på acceptabel nivå efter två
veckors lagring. Den optimala mängden DF-2 fastställdes till 0,15% av blandningen i
vikt. Resultaten av dessa analyser hittas i Appendix E.
Konkalorimeteranalys utfördes på flera träbitar behandlade med olika beläggningar.
Detta gjordes för att utvärdera effekten av olika flamskyddande additivämnen.
Samtliga additivämnen hade en positiv inverkan på beläggningens
flamskyddförmåga jämfört med referensen. Noggrannare jämförelser mellan de olika
additivämnena försvårades av låg sampelmängd kombinerat med träbitarnas
naturliga variation. För att noggrannare jämföra de olika additivämnena skulle en
större sampelmängd behövas.
