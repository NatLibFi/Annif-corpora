Title: Finnish cleantech companies’ implementation of GLOCAL to enter the Chinese market - A case
study of Finnish firms’ utilization of networks in the internationalization process
Supervisor: Maria Ivanova-Gongne & Nikolina Koporcic
Abstract:
As a result of globalization and the rapidly changing market environment firms must be able to adapt to
the changes it brings with it. Hence, there is a crucial need for an updated internationalization strategy.
The parachuting Internationalization model integrates the Uppsala and the Born Global models to show
that firms can reach success in the age of globalization if they are willing to execute creative strategies that
help them overcome the challenges in a psychically distant environment.
This study investigates how five Finnish cleantech firms have entered the Chinese market by
implementing a GLOCAL approach, which the Parachuting internationalization strategy is based upon.
The research focuses on how the firms have benefited from their networks within the internationalization
process and what company characteristics have affected the entry mode. The multiple-case study research
approach is used as the study’s research method. Qualitative interviews were used as a data collection
method for the study.
The results of the study show that the firms implemented a GLOCAL approach in different ways. Firms
that entered the Chinese market in the 1990s had to a greater extent used a strategy resembling the
Uppsala model, whereas firms that had more recently entered the market had more elements from the
Born Global approach. However, all the case companies had utilized combinations of both models.
Various kinds of networks had played a crucial role in the internationalization process and the case
companies had particularly benefited from guanxi, the informal social network existing in China and from
relationships created on the home market. The physical characteristics of the products had influenced the
choice of entry mode. Companies that had standardized products strived to find suitable distributors and
channel partners, whereas companies with a product adaptation strategy aimed to develop strong
relationships with their customers.

1. INTRODUCTION
The global financial and economic crises have driven the rise of emerging markets in the global
economy. China became the largest exporter in the world in 2009 and 2010 the second-largest
economy in the world, overthrowing Japan’s position. (Zou and Fu, 2011, p.11). This has made the
Chinese market very lucrative for foreign investments, and many Finnish companies also want to
profit from the growing market.
There are approximately 350 Finnish companies in various fields, that are active on the Chinese
market. Finnish companies have invested approximately 11 billion euros in China. The direct or
indirect employable effect is about 60 000 persons. Most of the companies have positioned
themselves in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong. In 2018, Chinese exports accounted
for about 5.7 percent of Finland’s total exports (Finnish-Chinese Trade Association, 2019).
Finnvera, which is a Finnish state-owned financing company, increased its export guarantees to
China from 3 million euros in 2017 to 93 million euros in 2018. This occurred, after almost ten
years of low demand. Mika Relander, who is a regional manager for Finnvera, explains that official
Chinese sources say that demand for environmentally friendly technologies is increasing in China.
Products and projects that have undergone a Western environmental and social impact assessment
are in demand, as Chinese buyer companies feel they will benefit from the assessments (Relander,
2019).
Finland has been a forerunner in sustainability. The country is reducing its dependency on fossil
fuels import by half and is aiming to ban the use of coal in power generation by 2030. If successful,
it would make Finland the first industrialized country in the world to ban coal power. The Minister
of Foreign Trade and Development, Kai Mykkänen, states that Finland is making a determined
move towards a cleaner energy system. Decreasing the amount of oil imported will require
remarkable changes in the whole transport system. A tenth of Finland’s car fleet, or 250 000 electric
cars, is strived to be utilized by 2030. Furthermore, the Finnish government has decided to increase
the share of biofuels blended in liquid fuels to 30 percent by 2030. This is done to achieve the
country’s greenhouse gas target of 39 percent, to which Finland is committed under the European
Union’s mission to reduce emissions. Mykänen explains that many biofuel investments are being
planned in Finland. Waste and side-products of the forest industry would be used as raw materials.
The Minister of Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn, explains that the country’s task is to develop into a
carbon-neutral society by 2050 (Lindström, 2016). Finland has managed to achieve sustainable
1

Jens Tuovinen

solutions for various industries with its green mindset and world-class research environment. In
2020, six Finnish multinational companies were featured in the Corporate Knights’ “Global 100 list
of the world’s most sustainable corporations”. (Corporate Knights, 2020). Furthermore, the World
Economic Forum ranked Finland third in its annual analysis of the energy sectors of different
countries. Energy Transition Index 2020 assessed the readiness of 115 countries to utilize clean
energy using three criteria: energy access and security, environmental sustainability, and economic
development and growth. Top-ranked countries share a reduced dependence on imported energy,
lower energy subsidies, and a strong political commitment to change their energy sector to pass
climate targets (Woord, 2020).
Finnish companies must know how to successfully expand to the Chinese market, which offers
substantial opportunities with its huge population. In the time of globalization, a company benefits
strongly from having a rich business network, that can help to reach success in the foreign market.
This is particularly important in China, where the concept of Guanxi is still present. The Chinese
value deep relationship building and prefer to have long-term business collaborations after a strong
mutual trust is established (Buckley et al, 2006, p. 284). Hence, foreign firms can benefit from
establishing a strategic alliance with a local partner that understands the culture and has a broad
network from the past. In some instances, however, a company prefers to oversee its operations in
the foreign market. The degree to which a company chooses to outsource its operations or establish
a joint venture depends highly on the company characteristics. Despite the fact, that the company
chooses to operate more independently, relationship-building with customers and other business
actors remains essential for the success of internationalization (Hollensen, 2007, p. 300).
In the past, internationalization models such as the Uppsala model from the 1970s were viewed as a
functional way to view a firm’s internationalization as it was characterized by risk-aversion and
gradual expansion. As a result of globalization and the rapid information sharing which the Internet
has enabled, internationalization models had to be updated. The Parachuting Internationalization
model is a blend of the Uppsala model and the Born Global model, but which is adapted to today’s
globalized market. The model is characterized by a firm’s need to take swift action and risks when a
gap or opportunity in the market is spotted (Fang et al, 2017, p. 6). This thesis aims to show to what
extent Finnish companies have utilized the new Parachuting Internationalization model to enter the
Chinese market. The model is built upon a glocal aspect, where the firm must be able to think
globally but act locally.

1.1

Problem definition

A Finnish firm must internationalize to new markets if it wants to expand and become a wellestablished brand. Often, firms in niche fields must reach new markets solely to survive due to the
small size of the domestic market. Finland is known for its innovative technology and from brands
such as Nokia and Rovio. Finnish firms, however, have generally in the past been struggling to
reach new markets, and establish themselves there.
China, which is the second-biggest economy today and has a rapidly growing middle-class, has a
growing interest in cleantech, which Finnish firms have expertise in. These firms that have a lot of
potentials, must however be able to quickly enter the foreign market. As a result of globalization, a
firm must rapidly move into new markets before competitors reach there and gain a major foothold.
Furthermore, a firm must have a clear vision and strategy regarding its expansion. This includes the
decision, to what degree it aims to outsource operations and collaborate with local actors. Pros and
cons must be taken into consideration, before moving to a new market with a differing culture. If a
firm fails to establish itself on the market, it can cost majorly the firm, and be a huge setback for its
operations. Although global markets have become more open and similar due to internet
information sharing, national markets still differ to a varying degree.
The Republic of China has strong Internet censorship called the Great Firewall. Instead of westerner
search engines and websites, they have been substituted with local ones. Baidu is like Google and
Maimai is equivalent to LinkedIn. Besides the censorship, the differing culture causes other
challenges for foreign firms such as language barriers, differing legislation, and its harming
reputation of copying technology. All these factors make it crucial for a firm to establish
relationships with key players, or to have an in-depth knowledge of the market to reach success.

1.2

Objective and research questions

The purpose of the study is to examine to what extent Finnish sustainable firms have used the
Parachuting Internationalization model when expanding to China. Furthermore, it will examine
what firm characteristics have been essential for a firm’s expansion to the Chinese market. To gain
this understanding, the empirical research will be conducted as a qualitative study. The reason for
the approach is the aim of getting thorough descriptions of how firm managers have determined
their decisions regarding internationalization.
The research questions of this study are the following:
3

Jens Tuovinen

RQ1: How has the Parachuting Internationalization model been presented as a way for a firm to
expand to new markets?
RQ2: How did Finnish companies implement a GLOCAL strategy for parachuting
internationalization to China?
RQ3: What company characteristics should be considered when a company chooses its entry mode
to the Chinese market?
RQ4: What are the implications of the companies’ various networks, for executing the parachuting
internationalization strategy?

1.3

Delimitations

The study is limited to China because emerging markets are differing strongly from the Finnish and
European business culture. Hence, the concept of the Parachuting Internationalization model can
perfectly be implemented. Moreover, it can be viewed to what extent a differing business culture
causes challenges. Furthermore, it is interesting to concentrate on China because it is the secondbiggest economy and is estimated to become the world’s largest economy in 2028 (Cheng and Nee
Lee, 2021). As a result of the contrasting Chinese culture compared to the Finnish one, the
importance of business networks is crucial. In general, Chinese people are not comfortable speaking
English in business settings, hence, it is often essential to have established relationships with local
actors, to have successful negotiations. The thesis is delimited to the study of Finnish companies, to
be able to compare the results from the original Parachuting Internationalization model study, which
was implemented by Swedish and Danish companies. Thus, the results will reveal, if Nordic
countries, in general, have similarly implemented the Parachuting Internationalization model, or if
the Finnish firms in this thesis study have used the model to a differing degree.

1.4

Layout of the study

The thesis is divided into six main chapters, followed by a Swedish summary, references, and
appendixes. The theoretical framework is built upon four subject matters: factors affecting the
foreign market entry mode decision (section 2.1), internationalization models (section 2.2), different
types of networks and their role for internationalization (section 2.3), and the Chinese market

4

(section 2.4). The theoretical framework is structured to support the purposes/objectives of this
thesis.
Following the literature review, in chapter three, the research methodology will present the chosen
method and motivate the selected approach (section 3.1 and 3.2). Followed by the criteria of the
selection of case companies (section 3.3). Empirical findings from the five case companies will be
presented in chapter four. The results and an analysis of the obtained data will be presented in
chapter five, including descriptive analysis and results and answers to the research questions
(section 5.1 and 5.2). The results will be discussed in chapter six, providing main findings as well as
limitations and suggestions for future research. A Swedish summary is included at the end of the
thesis in chapter seven.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The following chapter introduces and defines key concepts of the thesis, providing an insight into
previous research made within factors affecting the foreign market entry mode decision (section
2.1), internationalization models (section 2.2), different types of networks, and their role for
internationalization and resource benefits of networks for internationalization (section 2.3).
Additionally, the chapter will review the Chinese market by presenting the concepts of guanxi and
mianzi (section 2.4.1), China’s most essential environmental policies (section 2.4.2), and the
Finnish businesses that are active on the Chinese market (section 2.4.3).

2.1

Factors affecting the foreign market entry mode decision

A firm’s choice of its entry mode for a given product and target country is the result of many
different forces. Choosing an entry mode is a complex process with various tradeoffs among
alternative entry modes. Svend Hollensen (2007) explains that four groups of factors influence the
entry mode decision. The factors consist of internal factors, external factors, desired mode
characteristics, and transaction-specific behavior.

5

Figure 1 Factors affecting the foreign market entry mode decision, Hollensen 2007, p.298

2.1.1 Internal factors
Internal factors are constructed by the firm size, international experience, and the product or
service. The firm size is the base for the firm’s resource availability. When a firm is rich in various
resources it can expand easier to new markets than a firm that is lacking in resources. Oftentimes,
SMEs enter foreign markets using export modes because they do not have enough resources to keep
a high degree of control. As the firm grows it can keep more of its control when entering new
markets by implementing the hierarchical mode which consists of fully-owned subsidiaries
established through acquisition or greenfield investment (Hollensen, 2007, p. 298)
The international experience of managers is another aspect influencing the entry mode.
International experience reduces the cost and uncertainty of expanding to a new market and
therefore, increases the likelihood that the firm will commit resources there. Johanson and Vahlne
(1977) stated that uncertainty is reduced in international markets through operating in foreign
markets rather than from the knowledge obtained from acquisitions (Hollensen, 2007, p. 299).
The physical characteristics of the product or service are crucial in deciding where production is
located, which also affects the channel selection because the selling job is very different depending
6

Jens Tuovinen

on the product or service. Products that are technically complex, oftentimes need before and aftersales service. Marketing intermediaries may not have the expertise to do the work, hence, firms can
choose to use hierarchical modes instead (Hollensen, 2007, p. 299). Services can be distinguished
between hard and soft services. Hard services such as software services can be mass-produced.
Hence, standardization is possible. Soft services are very different in their characteristics.
Production and consumption happen at the same time and the customer functions as a co-producer.
Therefore, there are remarkable differences between hard- and soft-service suppliers regarding the
choice of foreign market entry. It is much more likely that a firm specialized in soft service choose
a high control entry mode than a hard service. A soft-service supplier interacts closely with its
foreign customers, which makes it more valuable for the firm (Blomstermo et al, 2006, pp. 222 –
223). Product differentiation advantages enable firms to raise prices and limit competition through
the implementation of entry barriers, which offer firms a natural monopoly. Hence, firms use
hierarchical modes of entry to keep their competitive advantages (Hollensen, 2007, p. 299).

2.1.2 External factors
External factors can be distinguished in sociocultural distance between the home and host country,
country risk or demand uncertainty, market size and growth, direct and indirect trade barriers, the
intensity of competition, and a small number of relevant intermediaries available (Hollensen, 2007,
p. 300).
Countries that have similar language, business, and industrial practices, comparable educational
levels, and cultural characteristics are viewed as socioculturally similar. Differences in sociocultural
terms between a firm’s home country and its host country can cause internal uncertainty and hence,
influence the mode of entry by the firm. Firms prefer joint ventures rather than direct investment
when the sociocultural distance is wide between the home and host country. Joint ventures offer
more flexibility if the expansion would fail due to low resource commitments (Hollensen, 2007, p.
300).
Foreign markets are often riskier than the domestic market because of the existing exchange rateand political risks. Unpredictability in the target market increases demands uncertainty and risk.
Hence, an expanding firm must do a risk analysis of the target market and its method of entry.
Firms often prefer entry modes that do not require a lot of resource commitments to risky markets
(Hollensen, 2007, p. 300).

7

Jens Tuovinen

The size of a market and its growth rate are crucial for deciding the mode of entry. Firms are more
willing to invest heavy resources into a large country with a high growth rate, which can be
achieved by establishing wholly-owned sales subsidiaries or by establishing majority-owned joint
ventures. On the other side of the spectrum, firms prefer using a minimal amount of resources by
licensing agreements or exporting to small markets that are isolated and hard to serve (Hollensen,
2007, p. 300).
High tariffs on the import of foreign goods and components favor firms to establish local
production or assembly operations. Furthermore, standards, customs formalities, and product or
trade regulations affect the operation decision and often favor the firm to source operations to local
actors. A culture where local suppliers are preferred encourages an internationalizing firm to
establish a joint venture. The local partner can assist in negotiating, selling, developing local
contacts, and establishing distribution channels (Hollensen, 2007, p. 301).
When there is a substantial amount of existing competition in the host market, firms often prefer
entry modes consisting of low resource commitments because the markets are in general less
profitable (Hollensen, 2007, p. 301).
A consequence of a low number of relevant intermediaries available in the host market is that
opportunistic behavior will often occur from the few existing export intermediaries. Hence, the
internationalizing firm is likely to implement hierarchical modes of entry to be able to reduce the
likelihood for opportunistic behavior (Hollensen, 2007, p. 299).

2.1.3 Desired mode characteristics
Risk-averse, control, and flexibility are viewed as desired mode characteristics.
Internationalizing firms that are risk-averse prefer export modes or licensing because they require
low levels of financial and management resource commitments. Joint ventures require management
time and effort, but they make it possible to share the financial exposure and risk. Modes of entry
with minimal levels of resource commitments, are unlikely to enrichen the development of
international operations and can lead to that the firm misses out on profitable opportunities
(Hollensen, 2007, p. 301).
Control is closely linked to the level of resource commitment. Indirect exporting offers minimal
control over how the product or service is marketed in the host market, whereas, wholly-owned

8

Jens Tuovinen

subsidiaries offer the most control but also require the most commitment of resources (Hollensen,
2007, p. 301).
Firms must consider the flexibility associated with a given mode of entry. The hierarchical modes
are generally the costliest but the least flexible and the most problematic to change in a short time.
Joint ventures also limit a firm’s ability to change strategy rapidly when market conditions are
changing (Hollensen, 2007, p. 302).

2.1.4 Transaction-specific factors
Transaction-specific factors are distinguished into the tacit nature of know-how, opportunistic
behavior, and transaction costs.
When a firm’s know-how transferred is tacit it is regarded as problematic to articulate. This often
consists of a firm’s complex products and services, where functionality is difficult to convey. The
challenges and costs involved in transferring tacit know-how make it favorable for firms to use
hierarchical modes. Hence, the firm can implement human capital by utilizing its organizational
routines to structure the transfer problem (Hollensen, 2007, p. 302).
The opportunistic behavior is based on the idea that there is always some friction caused by
opportunistic behavior in the relation between a producer and an export intermediary. Firstly, the
export intermediary might manipulate invoices and claim that the sales promotion activities have
been too high. As a result, the producer pays the export intermediary too much. Secondly, the
export intermediary can manipulate information on market size and competitor prices to get lower
prices from the producer (Hollensen, 2007, p. 296). The most crucial safeguard to provide trust
between the two parties is to make a legal contract, which allows a transactor to go to a court to
sanction an opportunistic partner.
The transaction cost analysis model explains that if the transaction costs consisting of search-,
contracting-, monitoring- and enforcement costs through externalization (importer, or agent) are
higher than the control cost through an internal hierarchical system then the firm should establish
wholly-owned subsidiaries. The model can also be explained by the following statement: if the
friction between buyer and seller is too high then the firm should rather expand by forming
subsidiaries (Williamson, 1981, p.548).

2.2

Internationalization models

In the following chapter, different internationalization models will be presented. To begin with,
three classic internationalization models founded by Johanson and Mattsson will be explained. They
are closely linked to each other, consisting of the Uppsala model (2.2.1), the Business network
model of the internationalization process (2.2.2), and the Network approach (2.2.3). Thereafter, the
Born Global model, founded by Oviatt and McDougall is explained (2.2.4). The chapter is
concluded by presenting the newly created Parachuting Internationalization model (2.2.5) and the
GLOCAL approach (2.2.5.1), which it is utilizing.

2.2.1 The Uppsala model
The first model of the Uppsala Internationalization process was published in the “Journal of
International Business Studies in 1977 by Johanson & Vahlne. Since then, the economic and
regulatory environments have changed drastically (Johanson & Vahlne, 2009, p. 1412).
According to the 1977 model, firms choose or should choose the suitable mode for entering a
market by analyzing their costs and risks based on market characteristics and taking into
consideration their resources. However, empirical observations showed that Swedish – owned
subsidiaries abroad began internationalizing with ad hoc exporting. Companies would formalize
their entries through deals with intermediaries, in most cases agents who represented focal
companies and the foreign market. As sales grew, they replaced their agents with their own sales
organization and thereafter they began manufacturing in the foreign market to overcome trade
barriers. Johanson & Vahlne called this dimension of internationalization an “establishment chain”.
The second dimension of internationalization was that the internationalization in foreign markets
usually started in foreign markets that were close to the domestic market in terms of “psychic
distance”, which describes factors that make it troublesome to understand foreign environments.
Companies would thereafter gradually enter other markets that located further away in psychic
distance terms. The process had its origin in the “liability of foreignness”, which explained why a
foreign investor had to have a firm-specific advantage to more than offset this liability. The larger
the psychic distance, the larger the liability of foreignness. The assumptions of the 1977 model are
uncertainty and bounded rationality. Additionally, it has two change mechanisms. The first
mechanism is that firms change by learning from their experience of operations and activities in the
foreign markets. The second mechanism is that firms change through the commitment decisions that
they make to strengthen their position in the foreign market. Commitment is defined as the product
10

Jens Tuovinen

of the size of the investment times its degree of inflexibility. The model is dynamic because
experience builds knowledge of a market, which influences the firm’s decisions about the degree of
commitment and the activities that build-up, resulting in the next level of commitment which
generates more learning. Johanson and Vahlne (1977) assumed that the process of internationalizing
will continue as long as the performance is favorable. Additionally, they assumed that learning and
commitment building takes time, and therefore expansion into markets that are further away in
terms of psychic distance would be made gradually. These markets were seen as riskier but
potentially rewarding. The model has in the subsequent literature been viewed as behavioral in
contrast to the internationalization theory (Buckley & Casson, 1976) which is considered economic.
Empirical studies from the 90s and 2000s have suggested that the model has a positive impact on
performance and hence, it can be examined as a model of rational internationalization (Johanson
and Vahlne, 2009, pp. 1412 – 1413).

Figure 2 The Uppsala model, Johanson, and Vahlne 1977, Researchgate.net

2.2.2 Business network model of the internationalization process
Johanson and Vahlne (2009) describe that trust and commitment building must be included in the
new model. They explain that since the 1977 model much has been written about social capital and
trust which include affective and cognitive elements. Second, they describe that from empirical
observation that affective dimensions are important for understanding the relationships that are an
essential part of the 1977 model. Third, trust plays a crucial role in recent research on relationship
development and business networks. The authors explain that trust is essential for strong learning
and the development of new knowledge. Trust can also function as a substitute for knowledge. This
can occur when a firm lacks the necessary market knowledge and allows a trusted middleman to run
11

Jens Tuovinen

its foreign business. Trust presumes that human behavior is characterized by high ethical standards.
If the intentions are positive and there is an eagerness, then trust can develop into commitment. If
trust builds up to the commitment, it suggests that there is a willingness to continue the relationship
and to invest in it, even acceptance of the need of making short-term sacrifices that benefit another,
for reasons of long-term interest for oneself (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p.1423).
Internationalization is viewed as the result of firm actions to strengthen network positions by what
is referred to as improving or protecting their position in the market. Because networks are
borderless, the characteristics between entry and expansion in the foreign market are less relevant.
The traditional view of entry which emphasizes overcoming different barriers is becoming less
important than internationalizing to strengthen a firm’s position in the network (Johanson and
Vahlne, 2003). Johnson and Vahlne claim that existing business relationships have a strong impact
on the geographical market a firm will decide to enter, and on which mode to utilize because the
relationships make it achievable to identify and exploit opportunities. Learning and commitment are
related to identifying and exploiting opportunities. Some types of knowledge are not available to
everyone and are instead held by network insiders, a strong commitment to partners allows first to
build on their knowledge, making it possible to discover opportunities. In contrast to the 1977
model, the authors believe today that internationalization is dependent more on developing
opportunities than on overcoming uncertainties, such as concerning institutional conditions in the
foreign market (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p. 1423).

Figure 3 The business network internationalization model, Johanson and Vahlne, 2009,
Researchgate.net
Internationalization depends on a firm’s relationships and networks. The focal firm will likely join a
partner abroad if that partner firm has a useful network position in one or more foreign countries.
There are two possible reasons for such a foreign expansion:
12

Jens Tuovinen

1. The likelihood of the firm finding interesting business opportunities. Partner bases of
knowledge are interrelated and are hence indirectly related to other members of the network.
Entrusting on a related knowledge base, the focal firm can enter networks abroad, where it
can spot opportunities (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p. 1425).
2. The second reason to go abroad for the focal firm takes place when a relationship partner
who is going abroad or already abroad wants the focal firm to follow. By following the
partner abroad, the focal firm shows its commitment to the relationship (Johanson and
Vahlne, 2009, p. 1425).
The destination market that the company chooses depends on various factors:
1. Generally, the focal firm and its partners choose a market where it sees opportunities
(Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p. 1425).
2. A foreign market in which the partner has a strong position (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p.
1425)
3. If the firm has no relevant partners, it could go where it might be easy to connect with a new
firm that already has a position in the foreign market. This could be for instance a
middleman, such as an agent or a distributor. After the focal firm has managed to establish
relationships with customers it can create a subsidiary and decrease its partnership with the
middleman (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009, p. 1425).

2.2.3 The network approach
Instead of viewing internationalization as a process between a firm and the market, the network
approach, developed by Johanson and Mattsson (1988) emphasizes the importance of independent
firms establishing networks. Firms are dependent on each other in their existing network. Firms
must establish exchange relationships to be able to sell their products and to get access to external
resources. Exchange relationships take time to establish, hence it hinders firms from changing
counterparts. The networks are characterized by the fact that they are stable and changing. Various
bonds are developed between firms in the network. When a firm is expanding to a new market it
must establish a network there. Through the developed relationships the firm can gain essential
resources and secure the sales of its products and services. (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, pp. 111 115).
The network model views the internationalization of a firm as it establishes and advances its
positions to counterparts in foreign networks, which can be achieved in three different ways. Firstly,
13

Jens Tuovinen

it can be accomplished through international extension, which is the establishment of positions to
counterparts that are new to the firm. Secondly, penetration, which means that the firm can develop
the positions and increasing resource commitments in those nets abroad in which the firm already
has positions. Thirdly, international integration, which implies that the firm increases coordination
between positions in different national nets (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, p. 118).
Johanson and Mattsson expanded on the model by creating a comparative analysis that explains
internationalization processes with four different situations.

Figure 4 Internationalization and the network approach: the situations to be analyzed,
researchgate.net
As shown in the table above, “The Early Starter” has just a few relationships abroad. The other
firms in the production net do not either hold many international relationships. As a result, the firm
does not have a lot of knowledge about foreign markets and it cannot make use of its relationships
in the domestic market to obtain such knowledge. This category is characterized by small firms.
Because ventures abroad require resources for knowledge development, the size of the firm plays an
essential role. The early starter follows the Uppsala internationalization model in the sense that
internationalization is initially launched in nearby markets using agents rather than subsidiaries.
Because the small firm is lacking knowledge, it can utilize the agent’s knowledge and its position in
the market, hence minimizing the internationalizing firm’s need for knowledge development and
demands for adjustments. As the sales volumes in the foreign market increase, it can be profitable
for the firm to invest in production facilities. This follows the Uppsala Internationalization model in
the expansion, where risk-taking is minimized by proceeding gradually. Using an agent assures the
firm’s delivery capability. Optionally, the firm could initiate the internationalization process with an
acquisition or a green-field investment. That would require a bigger investment and hence, only be
possible for larger firms that already have gained resources in the past. An advantage of that
14

Jens Tuovinen

approach would be the firm’s capability to possibly gain knowledge and market penetration in the
future. If a firm is capable to do market investments by having a service organization or a
manufacturing plant in the foreign market, it helps to create confidence with potential customers,
because they view the firm as a more legitimate and trustworthy actor (Johanson and Mattsson,
1988, pp. 120 - 121).
Actions taken in the early internationalization of the firm are in most cases done by counterparts,
such as distributors or other actors in the foreign market. Hence, the foreign counterpart adopts its
market assets to establish a new firm within its network. Oftentimes, it is uncertain if the firm will
succeed to develop its position in the market after the introduction phase. It depends on the degree
of structuring of the network and the positions of the counterpart. If the counterpart, which is
functioning as an introducer, is a leading distributor in a tightly structured network, then the
conditions are favorable for a quick and effective penetration by the firm, as long as adjustments to
the network are made. The demands for quantities might become so high that the production
capacity of the firm is insufficient. In that instance, it could require increased engagement in the
market by the firm through the establishment of production units. The parties can enter long-term
supply contracts, to reduce the risk of overcapacity. It is a process that is relatively consistent with a
deeply structured network (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, p. 121).
As the firm becomes more internationalized, it develops from an “Early starter” to a “Lonely
International”. In this phase, the firm has experience of relationships in foreign countries. It has
established knowledge and tools to handle environments that have different characteristics in their
culture and institutions. Hence, it decreases the risk of failure. The knowledge situation is more
positive when launching the firm into a new national net. Furthermore, the international firm has a
wider set of resource adjustments. An advantage with an international firm is that it has a higher
number of resource combination possibilities. Furthermore, it can use its market investments to gain
a fast diffusion of its new products (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, p. 122).
An international firm has an easier time than others in entering rightly structured nets. It already has
gained valuable knowledge about various national markets. Hence, further expansion is not as
dependent on similarities between markets as it is for the Early Starter. Experience and resources
offer the firm tools which are needed to make substantial market investments, which are demanded
to enter a tightly structured production net. It is also easier for the firm to establish relationships
with other firms with positions in the structured net or possibly take over them. An additional
benefit is that the firm can give its counterparts access to other national nets. Because the firm’s
customers, suppliers, and competitors are not internationalized, the Lonely International can
15

Jens Tuovinen

promote the internationalization of its production network and of the firms that are part of it. It has
an advantage over competitors that it has managed to internationalize before, especially in tightly
structured nets, because it has managed to develop network positions. International integration is an
essential feature in the development of the greatly internationalized firm to utilize the advantages of
being a Lonely International. (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, pp. 122 - 123).
If a solely domestic firm’s customers, suppliers, and competitors are international then the domestic
firm has also some indirect relations with foreign networks. The existing relationships in the
domestic market can function as the catalyst to enter foreign markets. This phase is called “The
Late Starter”. The firm can be ‘pulled out’ by either suppliers or customers in big projects. Hence,
market investments in the domestic market are assets that can be used when a firm is expanding its
operations abroad. Sometimes in those cases, a firm expands directly to a foreign market, which is
far away from the home market, which is possible due to the indirect relations that offer entry
opportunities. This differs from the traditional Uppsala Internationalization model where a firm
expands gradually from a nearby market to more distant ones. Oftentimes, markets that are close to
the home market, are heavily structured and there are already competitors that have established their
market position. It is easier for small firms to be a Late Starter than larger firms. Smaller firms are
often more specialized and flexible. They also have an easier time finding a niche in
internationalized nets. Larger firms often need to get established in a foreign production net through
foreign joint ventures or acquisitions. This forces the firm to take a big risk because it does not have
prior experience in those entry modes. The Late Starter has a comparative disadvantage regarding
its lesser market knowledge compared to its competitors. An additional disadvantage is the
difficulty of establishing new positions in a tightly structured net, which occurs because the best
distributors are already linked to competitors. Furthermore, competitors can make the expansion of
the firm challenging or even unprofitable by using predatory pricing. In comparison with the Early
Starter, the Late Starter has an easier time establishing trust because firms in the foreign markets
already have experience of actors from abroad. Because the markets are highly internationalized for
a Late Starter firm, it must obtain a stronger customer adaptation ability or better ability to influence
the need specifications of the customers than its competitors, which can be challenging for a firm to
achieve. Hence, when comparing the Early Starter with the Late Starter it shows the importance of
timing as the main issue in the analysis of strategies in networks (Johanson and Mattsson, 1988, pp.
123 - 124).
“The International Among Others” is characterized by the fact that both the firm and its
environment are greatly internationalized. Hence, when a firm continues its expansion to new
16

Jens Tuovinen

markets it does not change it critically and it only leads to small changes in extension and
penetration. The firm can benefit from its network when expanding to new markets by using
positions in one net over to other nets. International integration is however required to succeed in
this action. There is a strong need for coordination between the various markets. As a result, it often
leads to a rapid establishment of sales subsidiaries. National differences are smaller, and the
internationally linked networks offer the firm access to external resources. Hence, the International
Among Others may choose oftentimes to purchase various components instead of manufacturing
them themselves. Because essential joint-venture partners and customers are also international it
offers opportunities for the firm to increase its penetration to “third countries”. When a firm can
coordinate operations in international networks it can easier spot the changes that spread globally
and benefit from them. Furthermore, it can act on changes that occur in the localization of economic
activity. The firm achieves this by using its priorly established position in an expanding national
market to increase penetration in the particular market and possibly to markets nearby. Further
internationalization for a firm in this phase is based on the continuous ability to adjust and influence
the geographical reallocation of activities in the production network. The firm’s competitors are
also internationally active and function in tightly structured markets. Hence, the positions will
change by acquisitions, joint ventures, or mergers. The phase differs strongly from “The Early
Starter” because internationalization is less dependent on the need for knowledge development and
the similarities between the foreign markets and the home markets. Strategic use of network
positions is instead the most important factor within internationalization (Johanson and Mattsson,
1988, pp. 124 - 126).

2.2.4 Born Global approach
With increasing globalization, since the mid-1990s, the field of internationalization of the firm has
seen the emergence of the Born Global approach, which describes an essential new challenge to
traditional internationalization theory. The Born Global approach argues that firms can adopt a
global vision from its inception to establish competitive advantage, by making active use of global
resources. The Born Global firms are often technology-oriented small- and medium-sized
enterprises that view the whole world as one single market from the beginning. Therefore, they act
in a different way than the Uppsala model states. They jump over the early stages and aggressively
enter internationalization. The core of the model is customer focus, which is the key driver of
marketing orientation, product quality, and product differentiation. Customer focus allows firms to
17

Jens Tuovinen

concentrate their resources to serve markets and avoid direct resource-wearing competition with
large multinational enterprises. (Oviatt and McDougall, 1994, pp. 49 - 51)

2.2.5 Parachuting Internationalization model
Globalization inspires firms to internationalize in unorthodox ways. Extensive changes have
occurred in the global economic environment such as the emergence of the digital revolution, the
liberalization of cross-border markets, and technological breakthroughs. These changes have led to
“boundarylessness” in cultural learning, synchronized information sharing across nations and
peoples, knowledge transfer, therefore created extraordinary opportunities for firms to conduct
business on a global scale (Fang et al, 2017, pp 1 -2).
Hofstede’s paradigm from 1980 has dominated research on culture in the international business
context for decades. The paradigm explains psychic distance, cultural distance, and liability of
foreignness. Psychic distance includes factors such as differences in political systems, language,
culture, level of education, and level of industrial development. Cultural distance is similar to the
psychic distance used in the Uppsala school. Liability of foreignness comprises all additional costs
a firm operating in a market overseas is subjected to that a local firm would not receive. Psychic
distance is positively correlated with the liability of foreignness (Hofstede, 1980). The paradigm
was written before the Internet was established globally, hence the vision of culture has been
questioned by many academics. Substantial evidence has shown that doing business in a country
close-by to the domestic market with a similar culture can be just as challenging as in a distant
country with a different culture. The phenomenon is known as the Psychic Distance Paradox (Fang
et al, 2017, p. 6). However, the paradox has also been used to refer to exporting firms that have
underestimated the actual cultural differences in their operations. The Born Globals model is useful,
but it also fails to show the concept of culture from a dynamic perspective (O’Grady and Lane,
1996, p. 309).
Fang has proposed that culture can be viewed from a Yin and Yang perspective. The ancient
Chinese philosophy has a holistic and dynamic worldview. The Yin and Yang system can manage
paradoxes across organizational functioning (Fang, 2012, p. 25). Therefore, essential elements of
the Uppsala and the Born Global models can be used to develop a new strategy that firms can use to
overpower large psychic and cultural distances (Fang et al, 2017, p. 6).

18

Jens Tuovinen

Fang, et al (2017) researched four Scandinavian firms’ experiences of entering the Chinese market.
The research was made by a multiple qualitative case study method, based on in-depth interviews.
Three of the companies in the study were Swedish and one Danish. The interviews were conducted
in 2008 except for those of the Danish company that was conducted in 2006. The results showed
that companies had acted in a way that combined strategies from the Uppsala model and the Born
Global approach. The companies showed five common themes that resulted in their success in
entering China. The themes were the importance of knowledge, learning, and commitment;
customer focus regardless of geographic location; the need for speed; reduced salience of psychic
distance; and national cultural learning and balancing in globalization. The themes propose that
parachuting internationalization, a combination of the two prior models better show the essence of
the internationalization process in the era of globalization (Fang et al, 2017, pp. 17 - 18).
Knowledge, learning, and commitment are characteristics associated with the Uppsala Model. All
four case companies from the study noted the importance of the characteristics. The study revealed
that the companies acquired these characteristics through their relationships and networks in the
market. Furthermore, the results suggested that a small new start-up company can beat firm-specific
limitations such as lack of resources, by implementing market-based resources in the host location
(Fang et al, 2017, pp. 17 - 18).
In the Born Global Model, the customer is at the focus. The Uppsala Model, however, does not
focus on the customer. The study shows that to be successful, the international firm must be more
customer-driven than its competitors. Furthermore, the results suggest that the sequential stages in
the Uppsala model could have become obsolete, due to the globally changing market environment.
Hästens, one of the case companies, explained that they initially implemented a cautious approach,
by beginning their internationalization to nearby Nordic countries. However, the company’s view of
internationalization strategy has drastically changed, and now the management favors a global
perspective instead of a nearby perspective. (Fang et al, 2017, pp. 18 - 19).
The study also shows that firms need to be aggressive and rapid in their internationalization to be
able to become global players. This is contradictory to the Uppsala Model, which describes that
firms must develop in their domestic market before going overseas. The model can be bypassed
when two factors are occurring. Firstly, the existence of information technology and secondly, the
existence of tough competition. When these factors are in place, it can be useful to skip the
sequential stages of the Uppsala Model by parachuting straight as rapidly as possible to the target
markets (Fang et al, 2017, p. 19).

19

Jens Tuovinen

The aforementioned themes propose that the concept of psychic distance is increasingly less salient
due to rapid changes caused by globalization. The psychic distance between the domestic country
and target countries is less powerful than 15 to 20 years ago. The study’s results revealed that trends
and values spread across international borders (Fang et al, 2017, p. 19).
Even though the executives from all four companies felt that “liability of foreignness”, “psychic
distance” and “cultural differences” were not crucial for their success and entry to China, they
viewed it crucial to grasp the local culture. Some interviewees noted that traditional Chinese values
such as guanxi and face are still essential in Chinese society. They, however, viewed that these
traditional values coexist with Western and capitalistic values. Hence, the results suggest that it is
crucial to maintain a Yin Yang approach to grasp cultural learning and balancing in the age of
globalization. Therefore, globalization has not resulted in that national culture does not have any
longer any significance, rather, it means that national culture does not connote into everlasting
cultural differences that are resistant to change. The model suggests that each national culture can
learn and embrace new values and behaviors, (Fang et al, 2017, p. 19) which follows Fang’s
hypothesis that any given “foreign” concept can paradoxically find its base in the local host culture,
under the right context, time and situation (Fang, 2005-2006, p. 71).
The results from the study suggested, that neither of the leading internationalization theories could
capture reality solely. Hence, Parachuting internationalization integrates the Uppsala Model and
Born Global Model. Fang et al explain:
“Parachuting internationalization refers to a firm’s strategic targeting of markets with great
potentials, correct positioning, swift actions, and fast learning in world markets whereby the firm
appears to circumvent the conventional wisdom of liability of foreignness, cultural distance, and
psychic distance. Parachuting internationalization involves high risks and demands global vision,
courage, planning, intimate knowledge of the local terrain, effective use of networks, and basic
survival instincts”. (Fang et al, 2017, p. 20).
Parachuting internationalization offers insights into stage-skipping or springboarding and highlights
the firm’s capability to embrace a strategic intent when internationalizing in the age of
globalization. The strategy is based on the dynamic integration of the “Uppsala” and “Born Global”
models. By adopting a military metaphor, the Uppsala Model is the infantry in the army which
focuses on step-by-step advancement in the terrain, whereas the Born Global Model would be the
airborne bomber, which can fly high and far. The former has a superior advantage of indigenous
knowledge, whereas the latter effectively uses its speed and holistic view (Fang et al, 2017, p.25).
20

Jens Tuovinen

The results from the study show that concepts of “liability of foreignness”, “psychic distance”
“cultural differences” and “cultural distance” are less salient of a firm’s internationalization into
high risk and high yield markets in the age of globalization. The firm’s strategic assets are its global
vision and strong commitment to learn and build competence continuously through relationships
and networks in the target market. The model does not ignore cultural differences, rather, it views
them in the context of dynamic changes in the age of globalization. The findings show that it is
profitable for firms to capitalize on globalization trends, that have promoted the convergence of
consumer taste globally. Firms must also acquire knowledge from networks and partner with
domestic or foreign entities if the firm does not have in-depth knowledge and expertise. Due to the
rapid development in many emerging markets, it is not beneficial for a firm to act on a sequential
approach to foreign market entry, rather, the company should take into consideration parachuting
into various markets at the time (Fang et al, 2017, pp.24 - 25).

2.2.5.1 GLOCAL
Successful parachuting requires fulfilling the keywords forming the word “GLOCAL”.
G - global vision
The firm must have a clear global vision from the inception of its business. This could imply
reaching where the customers are, capitalizing on global trends, adopting a proactive high risk, high
yield strategy of aggressively scanning market opportunities globally (Fang et al, 2017, pp. 22 - 23).
L - location
The location where the firm chooses to operate is crucial for its success. To seek locations with the
best market opportunities and the need to meet the needs of the local customers is ingrained in the
global vision (Fang et al, 2017, p. 22).
O – opportunity
It is important for a firm to rapidly enter foreign markets and to establish the right networks to seize
the opportunities that they can offer (Fang et al, 2017, p. 22).
C – capital and other resources to support globalization efforts
A firm must have enough capital when expanding to a new market. The resources can be attained
through networks, organic growth, or joint relationships with other actors either at the home market
or abroad. The importance of networks is stated both in the Uppsala and Born Global Model. The

21

Jens Tuovinen

Uppsala Model explains in-depth the significance to support an investor’s globalization efforts,
whereas, the Born Global Model does not emphasize it. (Fang et al, 2017, p. 23).
A – accelerated cultural learning and swift action
There are cultural differences across national markets, the psychic distance, however, explained in
depth in the Uppsala Model seems to have become less important. This is due to global new trends,
mainly the Internet’s ability to spread information rapidly. China is a nation that has traditionally
kept multiple philosophical traditions, is keen on capitalistic and western influences, however, they
are simultaneously afraid to lose the values that have been fruitful in the past (Faure and Fang,
2008, p. 194). Cultural differences are not viewed as static anymore, instead, they are something
that can be learned. Culture can be changed through Yin Yang balancing. Hence, the notions of
national culture and psychic distance are viewed as both essential and non-essential in parachuting
internationalization, depending on how they are approached in each context, situation, and time
(Fang et al, 2017, p.24). There are both positive and negative factors associated with cultural
distance, the crucial aspect is to grasp when, where and how distance matters (Stahl and Tung,
2015, p. 391).
L – logistics preparation and meticulous planning
Firms must have an in-depth knowledge of the environment of the targeted market and plan
thoroughly all factors that can fail in internationalization. This functions as the “parachuting”
metaphor, where the paratrooper must be able to rapidly adjust to unexpected changes. This
flexibility is also an essential factor of the Yin Yang principle (Fang et al, 2017, p.24).

2.3

Different types of networks and their role in the
internationalization

Various types of networks are viewed in literature as affecting the outcome of the
internationalization process. Networks that are essential in many studies are different formal and
informal networks such as business and social networks along with strategic alliances. In the
following, definitions and characteristics of formal and informal networks are presented (section
2.3.1).

22

Jens Tuovinen

2.3.1 Formal and informal networks
Organizational performance can be viewed from formal and informal interactions. Formal
interactions are allocative by nature, whereas, informal interactions can be seen as being
“generative” to the extent that they assist individuals in organizations to generate new capabilities,
attain new skills and insights into ways that make it possible for individuals to handle complex
situations. Empirical evidence has shown that in many organizations, informal interactions are the
main way by which employees find information and manage to solve complex situations, and learn
how to do their work. Informal networks that are existing in an organization and which are taking
part actively in the managing of practices can influence the formal hierarchical design of the
organization, which leads to a co-evolution between formal and informal organizational networks.
Informal interpersonal networks are a major component of the organization’s knowledge transfer
process (Lamieri & Mangalagiu, 2009, p. 2).
Informal networks are self-organized, self-generated, and self-managed interrelationships between
organizational agents. These interrelationships form the foundations of effective and smooth flows
of experience, information, knowledge, and ideas. The informal networks function as an “informal
division” of “labor”, by holding the view that performance relies particularly on formal recognition
of the informal organization. It can facilitate faster outcomes and coordination between formal
teams and integrators, but it also brings new problems for leadership, which needs to manage
differentiated systems of relationships through network design (Lamieri & Mangalagiu, 2009, pp. 89).
Informal relationships among employees are often quite more reflective of the way work occurs in
an organization than relationships created by position within the formal structure. Often informal
relationships are invisible or only partially grasped by managers (Parker et al., 2002, p. 26).
Business networks are characterized to consist of formal relationships and hence, belong to the
category of formal networks. Social networks, however, can be viewed as formal as well as
informal networks depending on their purpose and the influence from outside forces. A strategic
alliance can also have a formal and informal character depending on the degree of formalization
between the actors. The characteristics and impacts of business networks (section 2.3.2), social
networks (section 2.3.3), and strategic alliances (section 2.3.4) on internationalization processes are
presented on a general basis in the following.

23

Jens Tuovinen

2.3.2 Business networks
Social exchange theory defines business networks as
“a set of two or more connected business relationships, in which each exchange relation is between
business firms that are conceptualized as collective actors” (Emerson, 1981, p. 2). The actors
consist of customers, competitors, suppliers, distributors, and the government.
Networks of connected firms are in a fast way replacing traditional markets and vertically integrated
companies. Business networks have always existed; however, they have drastically increased in
their number, complexity, and form. The factors driving the change are the increased importance of
knowledge, competitive forces, technological innovations, globalization, and the availability of
information technology (Halinen & Törnroos, 2002, p. 1286).
Business networks are not under the control of an individual firm instead they are self-organizing
systems. Hence, order emerges in a bottom-up way from the local interactions that occur among
firms in the relationships in which they are tangled (Ritter et al., 2004, p. 175).
Business networks are sets of repetitive transactions, based on relational and structural formations
that comprise interconnected elements, consisting of actors, activities, and resources. Business
networks are characterized by dynamic boundaries, contain the contrary and complementary targets
strived by each member. They cooperate in joint activities, and its actors exchange repetitively
commodities, commitment, trust, information, heterogeneous resources, and individual affection.
Furthermore, business networks are viewed as sets of connected exchange relationships between
actors controlling business activities. The business network is defined as a set of three or more
interconnected actors, as well as two or more connected dyadic business relationships, which are
structures of relationships between heterogenous actors, cooperating for a business purpose. The
structure of business networks is viewed as strategic alliances, collaborative business communities,
supply and inter-firm networks (Barnett, 2011, pp. 95-96).
Both, directly and indirectly, connected companies exist in a business network. Social and
economic dimensions of exchanges that occur often between companies, create business
relationships. Companies are the nodes in this network. When an exchange occurs frequently,
companies start to invest social and monetary resources in each other and they start to build trust by
exchanging knowledge (Öberg, 2019, p.124).
Definitions vary regarding business networks because they target different aspects, which can be
categorized into if the network is constructed on only business exchanges if the network is
24

Jens Tuovinen

delimited or limited in space or to specific assignments, or the importance of social ties for the
business exchanges (Öberg, 2019, p.125).
The structural or positional perspective views three types of actors in the business networks. These
are organizations, groups, and individuals (Todeva, 2006, p. 65).

2.3.3 Social networks
Social networks are broadly defined as a web of personal connections and relationships to secure
favors in the personal or organizational action. In organizational settings, social networks can
involve social relationships among individuals embedded in a formal structure of business
connections, such as strategic alliances or buyer-supplier relationships. Social networks are an
informal structure of personal relations bounded in social, geographical, or institutional space.
Social networks are personal ties that are built upon goodwill and trust, and which have been
associated with the process of national or international opportunity identification, resource
mobilization, and access to tacit knowledge. Home-based networks are a valuable resource for
international entrepreneurial SMEs to respond to the demand of global supply chain networks.
Hence, they are critical to identify global market opportunities and to broaden connections with
foreign intermediaries. Trust-based connections can provide key capabilities to the firms, regarding
speed and flexibility of response to global markets, by reducing information and knowledge
barriers, creating a successful cross-border business operation, and improving transaction cost
efficiency. Home-based social networks are a critical factor in moderating the performance impact
of internationalization. International entrepreneurial SMEs that expand into China, can highly
benefit from social networks because of personal connections such as “guanxi” function as the way
for doing business and understanding economic transactions (Zhou, et al., 2007, p. 674).
Informal social networks work as the initial basis, from which formal networks of business linkages
are created in new territories, and by which exporting relationships are formed. Social networks are
crucial to the identification of new opportunities, to gain access to foreign markets, and to develop
competitive advantages through the accumulation of international knowledge and the development
of formal business linkages across borders. Building and maintaining network relationships are an
essential part of the internationalization process in both inputs and outcomes into the process. As
input, the information benefits of social networks could influence the performance impact of
internationalization strategies. As outcome firms need to benefit from relationship networks such as
guanxi, which can offer profitable information benefits (Zhou, et al., 2007, p. 674).
25

Jens Tuovinen

Home-based social networks offer knowledge of foreign market opportunities, advice and
experiential learning, and referral trust and solidarity by a third party. These benefits can assist
internationalizing companies to create legitimacy, credibility and offer the development of new
capabilities for international expansion at lower risks (Zhou, et al., 2007, p. 676).
Social network theories build on the statement on the transmission of knowledge, or useful
information through interpersonal ties and social contacts with individuals.
Social capital can be divided into strong and weak network ties. Strong ties are related to resource
transfer, reciprocity, trust, and innovation. Weak ties offer non-redundant information, better
performance outcomes, and new opportunities. They are relationships with suppliers, customers,
and others that are friendly and business-like. Weak ties require less investment than strong ties,
hence, weak ties occur more in networks. These ties can grow relatively rapidly, and they are
essential because they function as sources of important information and know-how. With brokers
weak ties are crucial. Brokers are nodes in a network, or actors, who are tied to nodes that are not
tied themselves. Hence, brokers create ties between actors who without the broker have no link to
each other. Therefore, brokers establish indirect ties. In international business, brokers often offer
links across national borders, between actors who want to establish international business with each
other (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005, p. 544).
The existence, of cross-border weak direct or indirect ties, can positively and remarkably moderate
the speed of venture internationalization. If an entrepreneur has established such ties previously, the
initial foreign entry can happen unusually rapidly. If the ties do not exist, the internationalization
process is likely to be a lot slower. The size of a company’s network is the second key factor, after
tie strength that will control the speed of internationalization. With a large network, a relatively
huge portion of venture revenue comes quickly from foreign sources, therefore, the venture has a
faster commitment to internationalization (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005, p. 545).
Dense networks are useful when trust and reciprocity are important, whereas sparse networks are
useful at gathering new information. Actors have sparse networks when the nodes to which they are
tied, are not tied to each other. Sparse networks are believed to create new information better than
dense networks because the sparse networks link disparate nodes while the dense networks link
nodes through redundant ties. Dense networks have more links than sparse networks and hence
there is more interaction among all the actors in the network. Trust is stronger in a dense network
than in a spares network because there occur penalties for opportunistic behavior. Dense networks

26

Jens Tuovinen

can be viewed as a substitute for strong ties across national borders. (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005, p.
546).
An essential implication of the embeddedness of firms in social networks is the established trust
between firms. Trust between firms implies the confidence, that a partner will not exploit the
vulnerabilities of the other. A social network of prior ties can promote trust in two possible ways.
First, by functioning as effective referral networks. Through ongoing interactions, firms learn about
each other and can develop trust around norms of equity, or knowledge-based trust. Hence, a
partner can choose to refer a certain firm to the actor because it knows it is suitable for the actor’s
needs. Second, social networks can function as an essential base for enforceable or deterrence-based
trust. This means that the anticipated utility from a tie with a partner motivates good behavior. Each
partner is aware that the other has plenty to lose from acting opportunistically. A result of this is
that it enhances confidence in each other. Acting opportunistically could lead to loss of business
with the same partner, loss of other points of interaction between the two firms, and loss of
reputation (Gulati, 1998, p.303).

2.3.4 Strategic alliances
Strategic alliances are an inter-organizational network. They are overseen by formal and relational
governance mechanisms. Formal governance mechanism means contractual and authoritative
governance. Relational governance explains the role of norms, trust, and solidarity in contractual
relationships (Windsperger, et al., p. 230).
Strategic Alliances is defined by Ranjay Gulati as:
“Voluntary arrangements between firms involving exchange sharing or co-development of
products, technologies, or services”.
Strategic alliances are a popular strategy for companies to share risks and exchange resources,
achieving economies of scale, obtaining synergy and competitive advantages, and accessing new
markets. Furthermore, they can serve as an exchange agreement for partners to learn and acquire
from each other the skills, technologies, and knowledge that do not exist in their organizations.
Strategic alliance occurs when two or more firms unite to aim at a set of agreed-upon goals, in
which they share the benefits. In being able to achieve these goals, partner firms independently

27

Jens Tuovinen

control the performance of assigned tasks and contribute on a lasting basis in one or more key
strategic areas (Chen & Che, 2002, p. 1007).
The motivations for creating a strategic alliance can be divided into three groups. Firstly, high
transaction costs resulting from small-number bargaining, secondly, strategic behavior aimed at
enhancing a firm’s competitive position or market power, and thirdly a quest for organizational
knowledge or learning when one or both partners desire to acquire some important knowledge from
the other.
According to the network view, resource sharing is essential for all firms, because no firm is large
enough to be self-sufficient. Hence, the main task of strategic alliances is the creation of a formal
and stable relationship between partners to promote the ongoing exchange of resources. Therefore,
strategic alliances are solutions to long-term needs, rather than achieving temporary results. The
alliance is viewed as a formal agreement between partners to invest in a relationship to exchange
resources on a continual and sustained basis. The partners must invest in learning and adaption until
the alliance begins operating smoothly and shape to a mechanism for exchange. Furthermore, the
strategic alliance represents a commitment to invest in relation-specific assets. It has the potential of
collectively raising the competitiveness of its member firms through lower total value chain costs,
fewer defects, greater product differentiation, and rapid product development cycles (Chen & Che,
2002, p. 1008).
A threat regarding relations-specific investments regarding strategic alliances is that it increases
mutual dependency among partners, and therefore also their vulnerability. Hence, it is essential to
choose a suitable partner when forming a strategic alliance. Reputation and the level of trust and
reciprocity that develops between parties are important preconditions for establishing an alliance
(Larsson, 1992, p.98).
The appropriation of relational rent is also worth taking into consideration when deciding to invest
in a relation-specific asset. The partner that holds more bargaining power in the relationship is
entitled to more rent. Strong firms may decide to form a strategic alliance with weaker firms
because they have the power to appropriate relational rent. Weaker firms may benefit from an
improved position in other relationships when establishing an alliance with a strong partner. It
increases the credibility of a relatively unknown firm when entering new markets and hence, offers
profitable opportunities (Chen & Che, 2002, p. 1008).

28

Jens Tuovinen

From a network perspective, strategic alliances create a foundation for continuous exchanges, where
the partners negotiate and sometimes jointly decide on the use of resources that are committed to
the alliance (Chen & Che, 2002, p. 1008).
Strategic alliances can take place across horizontal and vertical boundaries. Market structures with
demand and competitive uncertainties are the most encouraging to strategic alliances. Competing
firms with comparable market power, establish alliances to decrease risks and to achieve scale
economies. These alliances are called horizontal alliances (Chen & Che, 2002, p. 1008).
Firms that are establishing alliances are facing a risk by not being fully aware of the behavior of the
other partner and the costs to a firm from opportunistic behavior by a partner if it would happen. A
partner might choose to limit its contributions to an alliance or then just act opportunistically.
Changes in the environment can also lead organizations to alter their needs and orientation, which
affects the alliance. To minimize any potential risks in an alliance, all actors must be aware of their
potential partner's needs and requirements. Furthermore, the firm must obtain information about the
reliability of its potential partners (Gulati, 1998, p.300).
The embeddedness of firms in social networks can both restrict and enable the alliances a firm
chooses to join. Firms that have had focused networks in the past and have been centrally situated in
the alliance network have shown to be more likely to establish new alliances with a high frequency.
Studies show that the embeddedness of firms is an essential influence on their alliance behavior. It
has also been observed that previously allied firms were likely to engage in further alliances. The
reason behind this has been the shared knowledge of partners' goals and capabilities. Also, indirect
ties between firms create informational benefits, this has been showing to be the case for both onelevel-removed indirect tires and more distant ties. Results show that firms that were unconnected in
the past were more likely to establish an alliance if they had common partners or if they were less
distant from each other in the alliance network (Gulati, 1998, p. 301).
Structural embeddedness also influences the choice of a partner to create an alliance with. The
status of an organization in the network affects its visibility and reputation in the system. The bigger
the reputation obtained is the wider the company’s access to a different kind of knowledge and the
greater the collaborative experience, which makes it a profitable partner. The properties of status are
more important in uncertain environments where the attractiveness of a potential partner can be
viewed from its status, which depends on the companies that are already tied to the partner (Gulati,
1998, p.301).

29

Jens Tuovinen

A governance structure is the formal contractual structure used to organize the partnerships in an
alliance. There is an extensive variation in the formal structure of alliances. At one end are joint
ventures, which involve partners establishing a new entity in which they share equity, and which
most closely resemble the hierarchical control feature of organizations. At the other end are
alliances with no sharing of equity that have few hierarchical controls set into them (Gulati, 1998,
p.303).
A critical concern of firms entering alliances has to do with the predictability of their partners’
behavior. To create predictability, firms can create a detailed contract and a second way is to
establish trust. Both knowledge-based trusts resulting from mutual awareness and equity norms and
deterrence-based trust resulting from reputational concerns establish self-enforcing safeguards in an
exchange relationship. The established trust can substitute for contractual safeguard. The familiarity
between organizations through prior alliances creates trust which makes it possible for firms to use
less hierarchical structures in organizing alliances (Gulati, 1998, p.303).
Research has shown that alliance success requires building trust with partners, flexibility in
management, constructive management of conflict, regular information exchange with the partners,
continuity of boundary personnel responsible for the interface between the firm and the alliance,
and managing partner expectations.
Alliances with embedded ties have also shown to perform better and exist longer than others. If the
Alliances have a prior history of ties, they are less likely to go under. (Kogut, 1989, p. 183)
Furthermore, the duration of exchange relationships creates “dyadic attachments” between firms
that create a strong bond. This social structure limits the organization's perceptions of opportunistic
behavior by partners, and the firms are more willing to establish nonrecoverable investments which
can boost the performance of the alliance. Both interpersonal and inter-organizational-level trust is
influential in the performance of exchange relationships (Zaher, et al, 1997, p. 141).
Cooperative capabilities required for a successful alliance includes: identifying valuable alliance
opportunities and good partners, developing interfirm knowledge-sharing routines, using
appropriate governance mechanisms, making requisite relationship-specific asset investments, and
initiating necessary changes to the partnership as it evolves while simultaneously managing partner
expectations (Singh, 1998, p. 662).
Productivity gains in the value chain are possible when firms are eager to establish relation- or
transaction-specific investments. Human asset specificity means transaction-specific know-how
created by transactions through longstanding partnerships. It increases as alliance partners develop
30

Jens Tuovinen

experience cooperating and gaining specialized information, language and know-how. It enables the
partners to communicate clearly, which reduces communication misunderstandings, hence
enhancing the quality and increasing speed to market (Singh, 1998, p. 662).
Social networks are valuable channels of information that offer opportunities but also creates
constraints for firms and have essential behavioral and performance implications for their alliances.
By channeling information, social networks make it possible for firms to discover new alliance
opportunities and can therefore influence how often and with whom those firms establish an
alliance. Once two firms have created an alliance, their relative proximity in the network can
influence the specific governance structure used to formalize the alliance (Gulati, 1998, p. 311).
The effectiveness of an alliance depends on its initial conditions which consist of task definition,
partners’ organizational routines, partners' expectations, and interface structure. The conditions can
make the alliance agile or plummet the efficiency. Additionally, the five dimensions consisting of
task, process, environment, skills, and goals explain the sufficiency of the alliance. Learning allows
the partners to reevaluate their partnership on the grounds of viewed efficiency equity and
adaptability. Reevaluation leads to readjustment to initial conditions and a new cycle of learning
and reevaluation. Successful alliances enable such a series of learning cycles over time, which is
characterized by a stronger trust and adaptive flexibility. An additional result is that the partners are
willing to establish larger and irreversible commitments (Doz, 1996, p. 70).

2.4

Resource benefits of networks for internationalization

Useful resources for internationalization that can be obtained through various kinds of formal and
informal networks are presented in the following chapter. Galbreath (2005, p. 980) defines a
resource as:
“Factor that has the potential to contribute to economic benefit” (p. 980).
A firm must be able to mobilize combinations of resources to succeed in its internationalization.
Hence, it can gain an advantage over competing ventures, which is described as the resource-based
view. Network resources are viewed as external resources embedded in a firm’s network that affect
business operations. Hence, network resource combination means bringing together complementary
resources from network relationships. Therefore, the value of the resources is strengthened by
combining them. Special resource combinations can enable a firm to produce more effectively and
satisfy its customers more positively than its competitors (Tolstoy and Agndal, 2010, pp. 24 – 25).
31

Jens Tuovinen

A structured overview of identified resources is presented namely market (section 2.4.1), network
(section 2.4.2), technological (section 2.4.3), and reputational resources (2.4.4).

2.4.1 Market resources
Market resources consist of different kinds of knowledge that are needed to conduct business in
foreign markets successfully. This information facilitates the company to adapt its product or
service when needed, to the target market (Allen, 2007, p. 180). A result of globalization is that
companies are operating in dynamic business environments. Hence, it has become more difficult for
companies to obtain the necessary knowledge, which is required to succeed in international
markets. Networks are an essential tool in accessing crucial information, which the company can
utilize greatly of. Among the essential types of knowledge are market knowledge (section 2.4.1.1),
and international knowledge (section 2.4.1.2).

2.4.1.1 Market knowledge
Market knowledge refers to objective information about a foreign market. It consists of information
about the market size, the regulations, the competitors, etc. Market information that is acquired
during the pre-internationalization phase is crucial for internationalization and its first phase. Before
internationalizing, the firm strives to get as much market information as possible due to the high
risk of the first entry. Networks facilitate obtaining general knowledge about market characteristics.
Particularly smaller firms benefit from being part of various kinds of formal and informal networks
because general knowledge about foreign market characteristics is exchanged. Various kinds of
networks can be beneficial for the firm, which is aiming to internationalize. Business network
partners can for instance offer crucial market knowledge regarding foreign institutions. Therefore,
the firm which is entering a new market can benefit from being aware of rules and regulations in the
foreign market (Johanson and Mattson, 1988). Through social networks, the firm which is
internationalizing can also gain knowledge about the latest technological developments, market
trends, and competition. The firm strongly uses the market knowledge acquired during the first
phase of internationalization. It is most extensively used during this phase. The intensity of the
application of market knowledge decreases as the firm advances in the internationalization process.
More emphasis is instead put on knowledge relied on network, cultural and entrepreneurial
knowledge (Umemoto and Katushiro, 2010).
32

Jens Tuovinen

2.4.1.2 Internationalization knowledge
A firm must have internationalization knowledge when expanding to a new market to be able to
gain market entry, localize strategies and organize international enterprise structures (Flether et al.,
2013, p. 1) Internationalization knowledge is defined as:
“experiential knowledge about internationalization in general” (Blomstermo, Eriksson, Lindstrand
& Sharma 2004a, p. 358):
Experience of internationalization builds its knowledge and this knowledge about marketing
operations can be shifted across markets, which is a valuable aspect within internationalization
process research. By developing internationalization knowledge, a firm can gain a competitive
advantage over domestic competitors and access greater international market performance.
Internationalization knowledge is viewed as the learning capability, that firms must have to achieve
a successful entry into new markets (Flether et al., 2013, p.4).
The network obtained in the pre-internationalization phase is crucial for the internationalization
start. The network can encourage the firm to begin to internationalize. Domestic and foreign social
networks influence firm internationalization during its first stage (Umemoto and Katsuhiro, 2010).
Holmlund and Kock (1998) found out in their study of Finnish SMEs that were in their initial phase
of internationalization, that social networks in the home country and abroad were viewed as the
most influential factors in internationalization.
Market entry internationalization knowledge consists of knowledge about how nations, institutions,
and businesses operate and differ internationally. It has been recognized in internationalization
process research as the most essential knowledge regarding how to enter new international markets,
including the appropriate mode of entry. It is a resource towards reducing the firm’s expenses
within the expansion to a new market. Furthermore, it makes it a strategic resource due to the
general difficulty of acquisition and assimilation of market entry (Flether et al., 2013, p.5). To
succeed in market entry strategies, firms must evaluate, integrate and systemize external nationspecific market expertise into internal firm-specific knowledge (Eriksson et al., 1997) Networks are
often needed to evaluate market-specific knowledge and to establish a marketing strategy. These
relationships are crucial for small firms and they require that the participants share knowledge to
succeed in relationship development. A result of a successful relationship is that firms manage to
collaborate more reliably, rather than to internalize operations regarding market entry. Experience
33

Jens Tuovinen

and knowledge about the choice of a particular entry mode are exchanged through various kinds of
formal and informal networks (Flether et al., 2013, p.6)
Localization internationalization knowledge consists of the sourcing of knowledge regarding
capabilities, environments, and usable strategies that will mirror the local market conditions.
Managers need to know how to evaluate localization internationalization knowledge to assess
international business opportunities, and to manage strategic internationalization decisions. Market
entry internationalization helps firms establish market positions, whereas localization
internationalization knowledge makes it possible for firms to develop strategies, that will offer a
sustainable competitive position in the new market. Localization internationalization knowledge is
needed for firms to develop marketing strategies that are suitable for the new market, and strategies
that coordinate the firm through various international markets with segmentation. Strategic alliances
are beneficial in the internationalization process because it enables strategic and operational
knowledge related to foreign markets to be shared (Teece, 1992, p. 2). Knowledge about developing
and implementing strategies in new territories is very hard to transfer because it stems from
systemizing accumulated knowledge from other territories. Localization internationalization
knowledge is viewed as a strategy within the resource-based view of the firm (Flether et al., 2013,
p.6).
International enterprise international knowledge makes it possible for firms to handle the internal
organization of their enterprises through various international territories. Furthermore, it makes it
easier to know how to control different partner behaviors, how to operate internal relationships that
are spatially distant, and how to assure appropriate levels of knowledge transmission that are
constantly occurring (Flether et al., 2013, p.7).
Cavusgil (1998) explains the importance of cross-border transactions knowledge, which consists of
international logistics, product adaption for different markets, the working of currency markets, and
transnational legal aspects.
When firms succeed in expanding to more territories, operating adequately requires more attention
to effective management. Practices such as foreign exchange management and customer operations
become more essential (Prashantham and Young, 2011).

34

Jens Tuovinen

2.4.2 Human resources
Human resources are defined as employees that have the skills, mindset, and knowledge to manage
a foreign market entry and to operate in a foreign market. Obtaining human resources is
advantageous for internationalization because risks and uncertainties to a foreign market expansion
can be minimized (Tolstoy & Agdnal, 2010, p. 24).
External resources which are embedded in a firm’s network that affect business outcomes are
viewed as network resources. Network resource combination is the act of bringing together
complementary resources from network relationships. Networks broaden the resource base of firms
and increase innovation. Firms can find opportunities through combinations of dispersed resources
that exist in their networks. Resources in networks are leveraged by constant interaction between
firms, that allow resources to be circulated through network relationships. Firms can leverage
resources through directly connected relationships and indirectly connected relationships. Direct
actors are connected to an economic agent, such as suppliers and customers whereas indirect actors
are customers’ customers and suppliers’ suppliers that are in the global market. Firms must be
proactive to be able to seek opportunities in the network and they must strive to change existing
combinations of network resources. Greater leverage of network resources leads to a competitive
advantage, which is succeeded through cooperation between the firm and its network partners.
International collaboration can create awareness of certain conditions in foreign markets, which
enables firms to respond to customer needs. By utilizing network resources, it leads to reduced
liabilities of smallness, which encourages innovative behavior. Network resources accelerate
internationalization by reducing market uncertainties and by offering business solutions. Firms that
use network resource combinations have an easier time achieving international growth (Tolstoy and
Agndal, 2010, p.26).

2.4.3 Technological resources
Technological knowledge is viewed as all knowledge that is needed to develop and implement
domestic products to technical standards that are suitable in target markets. This knowledge makes
it easier for firms to overcome the lack of experience. High-tech industries can achieve a
competitive advantage in their internationalization, by using effectively technological resources.
They are essential for innovation and help to enter a new market. The greater their knowledge, the
faster they manage to succeed internationally (Autio, et al., 2000, p.919).

35

Jens Tuovinen

Mowery, Oxley, and Silverman (1996) revealed in their study consisting of multiple case studies of
792 strategic alliances that technological knowledge is obtained in different countries by exchange
through strategic partners.
Research by Bell (1995) shows that Finnish and Norwegian software companies that before
developing their products, had received distribution rights for the Scandinavian market from third
parties in the US. This research provided evidence that the internationalization process started with
an inward technology transfer and cooperating with an overseas supplier, which occurred before
any export activities (Bell, 1995, p.66)

2.4.4 Reputational resources
A firm’s reputation in its network is crucial for reaching success because, it can be a source of
competitive advantage, by increasing firms’ long-term ability to attract foreign customers.
Furthermore, they constitute a big precondition for a fast international expansion among smaller
firms. Reputational assets help to inform external factors about the credibility, trustworthiness, and
quality of the firm. Reputation cannot be bought, instead, it is built, and it is substantially more
difficult to copy than tangible assets. Furthermore, it contributes to a greater extent to a firm’s
success than tangible assets. Reputational assets are among the most essential assets that a firm can
develop. A positive reputation results in positive performance. The benefits can be viewed both
socially and financially. Maintaining and building a positive reputation is crucial in the management
of firm resources (Galbreath, 2005, pp. 981 – 985). The reputation and credibility of one or more
actors within networks can spread to other actors within the same network. Hence, companies that
expand to a foreign market and do not have a priorly established reputation can benefit from the
reputation and credibility of other actors within the network that already has established themselves
there (Turnbul, et al, 1996, p.44). A study conducted by Coviello and Munro (1997, p. 361),
revealed that New Zealand-based software developers profit from their contacts with the formal and
informal networks, by gaining an improved international reputation and credibility.

2.5

The Chinese market

In the following chapter, the informal social network in China will be discussed, which is built upon
trust known as guanxi and saving face defined as mianzi (section 2.5.1). Thereafter, China’s
environmental policies are presented (section 2.5.2), and the chapter is concluded with Finnish
businesses on the Chinese market (2.5.3).
36

Jens Tuovinen

2.5.1 Guanxi & Mianzi
Guanxi, which is the informal social network in China is a crucial strategy to access information
and to get access to the relevant resources in a timely and flexible way. It can be viewed as a form
of relationship exchange that reflects the basic idea of network capitalism. The informal social
network is viewed as a system of trust, reciprocity, and interdependencies that offer value through
the effective use of social capital. Guanxi networks are often characterized by informal
interpersonal connections that are influenced by hierarchical Chinese cultural values and bonded
with reciprocal expectations. Hence, it embodies the traditional Chinese culture and functions as a
conscious choice on the part of actors preferring for personalized contacts and relationships. This
kind of social network can offer special information benefits to the actors that are connected by
exclusive or non-redundant personal ties, regardless of whether the nature of the social relations is
weak or strong. Guanxi-related networks can reduce transaction costs or increase transaction values
through an easier exchange of resources, knowledge, and information (Zhou, et al., 2007, p. 676).
Guanxi has both strong significances for interpersonal and inter-organizational dynamics and
functions as an inseparable element of the Chinese business environment. The informal social
network can be viewed as a web of interpersonal relations spread throughout Chinese societies.
Business practices that are based on Guanxi can besides lowering search and other transaction costs
also reduce uncertainty, offer usable resources and a sense of connectedness. Relationships based
on Guanxi, are especially beneficial for foreign investors because they reduce environmental
uncertainty and opportunistic behavior. Hence, foreign firms should aim to build up guanxi to
establish a competitive advantage.
Mianzi is the recognition of an individual’s social position, which is seen as a person’s prestige and
dignity. In Chinese culture, it is crucial to protect a person’s mianzi. Saving face or mianzi makes it
easier to build a network and to get access to other’s social resources. Hence, mianzi goes hand in
hand with guanxi. By developing guanxi and saving mianzi in relationships, it creates trust between
partners. In strategic alliances trust is crucial for the relationship to prosper, by enabling open
information exchange, improved coordination, and less bureaucratic costs (Buckley et al, 2006, p.
276 – 277). Trust occurs when foreign and local firms have a shared mindset. This mindset is
crucial for foreign-invested firms to have ingrained, to achieve success in China. A shared mindset
can be achieved when both sides strive to actively build guanxi and respect mianzi. Hence,

37

Jens Tuovinen

relationships between firms in China can be developed in the same way as at a personal level
(Buckley et al, 2006, p. 283).
Firms that are entering China should have a long-term vision when designing business and
knowledge transfer strategies. In the Chinese culture, long-term engagement is valued, which
enables people to build mutual understanding and nurture trust. This reflects the usefulness of
guanxi building with the Chinese environment (Buckley et al, 2006, p. 284).
Guanxi and mianzi make it clear that cultural awareness is essential for a firm’s business strategy by
affecting its performance and knowledge transfer. Trust, which is the essence of relationshipbuilding is important at personal, corporate, and governmental levels. Trust is more challenging to
establish with local partners and governmental entities because of a differing organizational culture.
However, long-term commitment makes it easier to nurture trust between organizations. Guanxi and
mianzi can be utilized on a governmental level by building trust in various ways for instance in joint
ventures established with state-owned companies, which can result in that the government
implements beneficial policy makings for the firm (Buckley et al, 2006, p. 286).

2.5.2 China’s environmental policies
A part of the Chinese planned economy is that China has outlined, that by 2030, the streets will no
longer have cars running on internal combustion engines and they will be replaced with electric
ones instead. Another efficiency measure is the Blue-Sky protections War 2017 program, according
to which factories manufacturing internal combustion engine cars may no longer be established in
China (Väkeväinen, 2019).
In the nation’s 14th five-year plan period (2021 – 25) China is aiming to progress in building an
ecological civilization, optimize the development and protection of territorial space and achieve
notable results in green transformation of production and lifestyle. The country will allocate energy
and resources more appropriately and raise utilization efficiency. Furthermore, China will continue
reducing emissions of major pollutants, improving its ecological environment, develop its urban
and rural living environment and make ecological security shields more solid. Significant progress
will be made in the reforms of the property rights system and the market-based allocation of factors
of production (Xinhua, 2020).
At the EU-China Summit in July 2018, both parties reaffirmed their commitment to go forward
with the implementation of the Paris Agreement and deepen their cooperation on climate change
38

Jens Tuovinen

and clean energy. The two parties agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation on many different
aspects such as energy efficiency, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies,
emission trading, clean energy, low-emission transport, climate-related technology, investment in
climate and clean energy projects, and cooperation with other developing countries (European
Union, 2018).
China is furthermore aiming to monitor, rate, and regulate the behavior of market participants
through their new “social credit system”. The plan, which was first published in 2014, applies credit
ratings across environmental, social, and political sectors. As a result, companies that have higher
emission targets than allowed will receive a lower rating, leading to punitive measures such as
higher taxes or further sanctions. The plan will function on big data that monitors and evaluates
social and economic behavior, by implementing real-time feedback.
The program aims to improve environmental protection by establishing environmental punishments
and incentives. The required information that companies must share consists of environmental
protection permits, construction project environmental management, nuclear and radiation safety
management, sewage charges, and environmental protection tax payments. Additionally, some
enterprises must share information regarding the following factors: key pollutant discharge unit
monitoring, pollution monitoring, access to and use of special funds for environmental protection,
and environmental risk management information. The aim of the program is that companies actively
check their score and take measures to fix any occurring problems that are causing the plummeting
score. The program was implemented in Jiangsu province in 2019, based on environmental credit
ratings from 2017. China is striving to fully enforce the social credit system by 2020 (Davies &
Westgate, 2019).
The country has already made advances and been able to show results in its environmental policies.
In 2018, China’s carbon intensity fell by 4.0%, a cumulative decline of 45.8% compared to 2005.
Furthermore, the same year large-scale land greening and ecological protection and restoration
engineering projects continued to accelerate (Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People’s
Republic of China, 2019).

2.5.3 Finnish firms on the Chinese market
The Finnish companies in China suffered from low demand at the beginning of 2020 when the virus
struck, but the business operations returned to an almost normal level on a very fast schedule. For
39

Jens Tuovinen

instance, UPM which is a Finnish forest industry told that their factories stayed active during the
whole pandemic in China and explained that they used the knowledge regarding the virus in other
market countries. Jenni Isola, the Secretary-General of the Finnish - Chinese Trade Association
states that Finnish companies have expertise in the field of digitalization, health technology,
intelligent transport, energy, and clean food. These sectors offer profitable business opportunities in
China (Isola, 2020).
Ding Ma is an expert in Chinese trade and has worked as a market analyst in Beijing, and four years
in the Chinese ministries of foreign affairs, and one year at the export promotion center. He explains
that even though there are 1,3 milliard inhabitants in China, it remains challenging for a Finnish
company to expand to the Chinese market and compete with their products. He tells that China is
currently one of the most competitive markets in the world. Hence, a Finnish company is required
to have a good competitive advantage, an understanding of the local language and the culture. A
Finnish company with competitive knowledge can easily be overshadowed by others if the
abovementioned factors are not implemented. Oftentimes, foreign companies do not compete
directly with Chinese products, but rather foreign companies compete with each other. Chinese
companies on the other hand are competing for a growing domestic market but also more abroad,
particularly in the high-end class. Therefore, the perception of China only as a lower-priced country
is starting to fade away. Ding Ma mentions that Chinese successful actors take a long time to
choose a foreign partner with whom to establish a joint venture in China. However, after the
partnership is established, the expansion is rapid and profitable. Expanding firms should be aware
that in terms of intellectual property rights, copying is still common at the grassroots level.
Furthermore, possible court hearings in intellectual property rights infringement cases can take
several years, so the potential economic benefit of a favorable judgment may quickly wither away
due to a long legal battle. Chinese investors have become accustomed to high returns in recent
years. Hence, a Finnish company must increase its customer numbers or its market share at least
tenfold in the initial phase, to maintain the investors' interest in the company’s operations.
(Väkeväinen, 2019).
Finland’s exports to China in 2019 equated to a 5.4 percentage share of total exports. The amount
was 3493 million euros. It was a -1 percentage decrease from 2018. China is Finland’s sixth most
important exporting country (Board of Finnish- Chinese Trade Association, 2020).

3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The empirical part of the study is done with the aim of understanding to what degree Finnish
cleantech companies have implemented the International Parachuting strategy by implementing
GLOCAL. Furthermore, reasons for the companies’ entry modes are studied. Qualitative research
was chosen for gathering the data. In the following chapter, the choice of research method and the
reasons behind the choice will be presented. The chapter includes a general research approach of
how the data was collected and concludes with a presentation of the choice of research method.

3.1

General research approach

The research was implemented by conducting in-depth interviews. The interviewees were either
founder or had managerial positions in the company, which enabled to receive as reliable data as
possible. As a result of Covid-19, the interviews were conducted either by web conferencing
software (Zoom & Microsoft Teams) or through phone calls. The length of the interviews varied
quite a lot. They were in general 30 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. In general, interviewees that
had been for a long time active in the company were willing to share more information due to the
broad knowledge that they had gained over the years in the company. Each interview template was
edited to suit the company in question, based on the research made by the researcher on the
company’s background. The templates at the end of this thesis were used as the basis, before
shaping the questions for each company. The interviews were conducted between the time frame of
3.11.2020 – 8.2.2021.

3.2

Research design – case study

Qualitative methods are viewed as fitting when the objective of the research is to understand
experiences, attitudes, and behavior in-depth (Yin, 2016). Hence, a qualitative method was chosen
for the research because choosing suitable case companies enabled the gather of valuable data
through the personal experiences of the interviewees. Yin (2016) states that in qualitative studies,
free formulating answers are mostly included, and responses are divided into categories or classes
rather than quantities or frequencies. Qualitative approaches are generally more time-consuming
than quantitative approaches, often having participants formulating their own answers and going
more in-depth with the attained responses. Because qualitative methods need more time and
resources, the samples are often smaller (Yin, 2016). Since the research aims to study the
41

Jens Tuovinen

interviewees’ experiences networking with various Chinese actors, which is a personal and
subjective theme that requires thorough answers a qualitative approach is the most applicable
method to use.
Qualitative research was chosen as an alternative to quantitative research because it enables for a
more flexible research method with open-ended questions and allows the participants to respond in
greater detail (Yin, 2016). By choosing a different research method, the data would not have been
as rich, due to the elements of the research questions that required an in-depth appreciation, in their
natural real-life context.
Case studies are often used when it is hard to find a precise solution (Solberg Søilen & Huber
2006). Hence, it is a suitable choice of method for the research because the answer is not numerical
rather it is more complex by viewing how companies have internationalized and used their
networks. Yin (2003) explains that case studies are typically used to answer questions related to
“how” and “why” because they enable an explanatory approach. Since the research problem is
geared to answer “how” Finnish cleantech companies have implemented the Parachuting
Internationalization model, the case study format is the most appropriate method to use.
Furthermore, choosing a case study as the method of choice enables gathering for as much in deptdata as possible, which is valuable because the amount of existing data regarding Finnish cleantech
companies’ internationalization process to China is quite low.
A difference between a single case study and a multiple case study is that in the last mentioned, the
researcher is studying multiple cases to understand the differences and the similarities between the
cases. Evidence obtained from a multiple case study is also measured strong and reliable (Baxter &
Jack, 2008). Therefore, a multiple-case study was chosen for the research to be able to understand
the difference and similarities between the Finnish firms’ internationalization to the Chinese
market.

3.3

Selection of case companies

All the case companies chosen for the study are cleantech oriented and founded in Finland. They
differ in aspects such as size, existing time on the market, and field of industry. For instance,
Vaisala was founded in 1936 and is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki stock exchange market, whereas,
Roboride is a limited start-up company established in 2017. Due to the differing business fields that
the companies are active in, it made the results more diverse because they have peculiar
42

Jens Tuovinen

characteristics and business strategies. The reason cleantech companies were chosen for the
research, was to be able to study how China’s environmental initiatives and policies have affected
companies’ operations.

4. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS: CASE COMPANIES
This chapter of the master’s Thesis provides information about the case companies that were
interviewed for the study; Cross Wrap Oy Ltd, Vaisala Corporation, Wetend Technologies Ltd,
Roboride Ltd, and Glaston Corporation. The chapter will consist of a background of the companies
and their products or services, insight into their competitive advantages, their internationalization
processes, and their utilization of networking during internationalization. The people interviewed
from each respective firm were Participant 1, the Sales Director at Cross Wrap Oy Ltd; Participant
2, Vice President, Industrial Measurements APAC at Vaisala Corporation; Participant 3, Chief
Executive Officer of Wetend Technology Ltd; Participant 4, Chief Executive Officer at Roboride
Ltd and Participant 5, Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer at Glaston
Corporation.

4.1

Case company: Cross Wrap Oy Ltd

4.1.1 Company background
Cross Wrap was founded in 1992 by entrepreneur Kalle Kivelä. He came up with an innovative way
of wrapping square bales and other rectangular end products. He made the first drawings of the
wrapping system by hand on a cargo ship on his way back to Finland from the UK machinery show.
The most essential reason to develop the Crosswrapping method was customers’ requests to have a
reliable stretch wrap packing system, which would optimize the usage of film to the right places
that are the corners and handling sides of the package. This innovative method makes the package
more robust with lower cost. In 1994 the first Cross Wrap machine was built.
Cross Wrap’s following invention to a customer request was developing the CW Bale Opener,
which opens the wired and wrapped bales when you want to use the baled material.
The company has always been dedicated to manufacturing, engineering, and installing stretch-film
bale wrapping, bale dewiring, bale opening, and board packaging machines wherever needed. Cross
Wrap has been providing trustful service for companies globally since its foundation.
43

Jens Tuovinen

The customer's need has always been and is still to this day the company’s primary inspiration for
creating innovative products.
Cross Wrap has manufactured, delivered, and installed 500 Cross Wrap machines, serving
customers in 55 countries, and producing more than 95 million Cross Wrapped bales and finishedproduct packages (crosswrap.com).
Cross Wrap is the global market leader, in making machinery that wraps bales of waste. Participant
1 explains that they differentiate themselves from their competition by having the most customer
references, their bale wrapping technique differs from the competition and they have a patent on it.
Furthermore, they have various machines such as bale wire openers, and machines that handle
plasterboard. Some parts in every machine have a unique patent.

4.1.2 Entry to the Chinese market
Because the Finnish market is so small, the company decided straight from the beginning to export
abroad. Sales volumes in Finland also vary a lot. Some years Cross Wrap makes no sales on the
domestic market, whereas other years there can be a few sales. Hence, The company strived to
internationalize from its inception. Participant 1 states:
“Crosswrap has evolved through broadening its network and by customer references. The company
has built up its reputation over time and has become a well-known established company. Business
events have been valuable to gain new contacts and to share information”.
The initial market that the company exported to were mostly countries from Europe: In 1994 the
company started exporting to Germany and United Kingdom. In the following years, it expanded its
exports to Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Italy, Lebanon, United States, and New Zealand, etc.
The company established its first contact in 2017 with a Chinese prospect, and the following year a
contract was signed. Cross Wrap does not have an office in China, but it will perhaps open up one
in the future. A Chinese person is employed by Cross Wrap that works as a freelancer.

4.1.3 Utilization of existing networks, experience, and knowledge
Networking and the network are very essential to Cross Wrap. What characterizes the company’s
network is that they have not so far had an agent or a representative person who would have

44

Jens Tuovinen

exclusive rights to sell the machines. In part, it is because every wrapping machine has a baling
machine in front of it, and some customers prefer a baling machine of a certain brand. If Cross
Wrap would choose an agent from a country that would have a lot of market knowledge and
preferences, there remain some risks. In most cases, a customer needs both a wrapping machine and
a baling machine. The agent however sells only a certain brand of wrapping machines and baling
machines. Hence, if a customer would prefer a certain brand’s baling machine, that would not be
suitable for Cross Wrap’s wrapping machine then the company would lose a sale. This would cause
uncertainty because countries have various baling machine companies. The quantities that Cross
Wrap sells to individual countries are quite small and every customer has particular needs, hence it
is not likely to be profitable to have an agent with exclusive rights. Furthermore, the majority of
agents have different brands that they sell and therefore, they put most resources to sell a brand that
has a lot of demand. Cross Wrap’s machinery is a niche and its sales quantities to individual
countries are quite low. This results in that the agent would not put as many resources to sell their
machines.
Participant 1 further explains why Cross Wrap wants to oversee its sales operations:
“Because projects are individual it is easier for Cross Wrap to operate independently without
having a person with exclusive rights responsible for sales. This way Cross Wrap can adjust the
machinery to the customers’ needs”
Cross Wrap has however certain agents that sell various brands of machinery, and oftentimes they
contact the company, although they do not have exclusive rights. In those cases, the agent works as
the buyer from Cross Wrap and the agent delivers the machine to the end customer.
If Cross Wrap would sell for instance components to paper mills which would be suitable for every
machine, then it would be more effective, convenient, and profitable to have a person with
exclusive rights.
The network is essential to Cross Wrap so that it can serve its customers’ specific needs in different
countries. Another disadvantage of having agents with exclusive rights would be that the market
knowledge at new locations would remain narrow because the company would only receive
information that the agent would inform them with. When Cross Wrap oversees the sales process, it
can serve its customer in a customized fashion and it gets information of the customers’ demands,
such as quantities of machinery needed.

45

Jens Tuovinen

Perhaps Cross Wrap will choose an agent in China with exclusive rights in the future because it is
quite time-consuming and hard to operate without one. Furthermore, in certain countries, Cross
Wrap has had agents that have been responsible for sales, even though they have not had exclusive
rights.
Participant 1 explained the following when questioned what the most essential factors for building
trust and commitment with partners are:
“That is an easy question. Firstly, the most important thing is that you never lie. You must always
speak truthfully and stay within facts. When you start to tell false facts, you can never remember
everything correctly and what you have said in the past. Secondly, you do not tell things that are
told to you confidentially, to anyone else. For instance, if a company mentions that they have a
project at a specific location, then you are not allowed to tell a third-party that they should also
strive to launch a project there”.
When customers ask people at Cross Wrap about various client projects and competition, they reply
that they cannot answer the question because they do not want that a customer would tell to a third
party about Cross Wraps’ operations. Hence, secrecy even though it would not be a non-disclosure
agreement is crucial. The circle within the business field is quite small, for instance, at events
worldwide, there are often the same European exhibitors. Therefore, if you would break your
reputation it would affect you greatly and it would be very challenging to build it up again.
Participant 1 states, that despite small cultural differences, that in the end, people are people
wherever you are, and that trust is a global value that shows your character and is respected
everywhere.
Cross Wrap cooperates with Chinese bale manufacturers. If a customer needs a wrapping machine,
a baling machine is also required. Hence, Chinese bale manufacturers help to spread the good word
about Cross Wrap’s wrapping machines. Furthermore, Cross Wrap collaborates with a European
whole supplier that has a resale contract in China. Cross Wrap has managed to build its network
with Chinese actors through different channels. Participant 1 explains:
“There are many European business actors that have established their presence on the Chinese
market, by having a subsidiary or part of their manufacturing in China. These actors have assisted
Cross Wrap by being the initial contact to Chinese actors. Furthermore, various events and
webinars have been useful to get in contact with actors within the field.”
Cross Wrap’s relationships in China have evolved substantially. Participant 1 describes:
46

Jens Tuovinen

“Trust and cooperation improve when you spend time together, and work to achieve a common
goal”.
Cross Wrap’s cooperation in China has been particularly beneficial with certain paper mills that
have often initiated the negotiation by approaching Cross Wrap, and by explaining that they would
be interested to order a similar machine, that they have acquired to another location in the past.
Cross Wrap has also been able to gain new customers through word-of-mouth. Participant 1 states:
“An advantage operating without agents with exclusive rights is that Cross Wrap can build up
stronger relationships with their customers through trust and commitment. There have been cases
when an employee from a paper mill has started working at a different company’s factory, he or she
has recommended Cross Wrap and through that word-of-mouth, it has managed to increase its
sales.”
The biggest events are essential for Cross Wrap to get to know different actors within the field. You
can meet your partners, and old- as well as new customers there. Besides being a social gathering,
events are beneficial to establish new deals. Participant 1 tells that it is a good way to build trust and
commitment, by being active and visiting other partners stands. Before the pandemic struck,
Chinese customers and actors had gradually increased their presence at various events that had been
held in Europe. International events have been an essential part of Cross Wrap’s internationalization
and a tool to gain market knowledge. The events have been very useful to get new prospects.
Participant 1 states:
“There are new prospects at every event. Oftentimes we get many contacts, of which approximately
10% turns into potential deals. Two Chinese companies’ CEO’s attended business events and
became interested in Cross Wrap machinery. Hence, that was the initial contact and the spark
which led to future sales “.
Cross Wrap evaluates after every event how successful it was for the company, and if it would be
profitable to attend in the future. Certain events were held yearly, which were viewed as an excess
number by actors within the field. Participant 1 explains that you do not have that much new
information to share with people within such a short period, hence, it is not that valuable and causes
avoidable expenses. These yearly events are kept so often because it is profitable for the event
arrangers. Participant 1 thinks that certain events will become unprofitable and laid down in the
future, but that the biggest events such as IFAT will stay relevant. Cross Wrap has participated three
times at a bigger event that is normally held once a year. Participant 1 tells:
47

Jens Tuovinen

“The first time we did not have an own stand, instead we shared a stand with a partner. The second
time we were independently an exhibitor and we had our stand. We got some contacts, but they did
not develop into future sales. The last time, we had a local Chinese partner that represented us. We
could not participate due to travel restrictions, because of the pandemic. There were not as many
participants, but we gained some contacts that have turned into potential customers”.
The partner that was hired works and represents solely Cross Wrap and no other actor within the
waste management field.

4.1.4 Characteristics networking with Chinese actors and market challenges
Participant 1 tells that there are no essential differences in cooperation with customers and partners
regarding countries. He tells that every country consists of various companies, some companies are
easier to do business with than others. However, the Chinese business culture has some challenges.
Participant 1 explains:
“the Chinese business culture brings certain challenges, for instance, a company’s hierarchical
structure and the existing language barrier. A trait that characterizes the business culture is that
Chinese people value face-to-face meetings within networking”.
Participant 1 explains that trust and commitment building with Chinese actors is more challenging
and difficult. He explains that it requires various meetings to establish trust. Language is a huge
barrier because certain nuances are lacking from the discussion. Regarding information sharing
reluctance Participant 1 states about Chinese actors:
“The customer has always shared essential information needed for the installation of the
machinery. Secondary data, however, such as other clients the customer orders machinery from, or
to who and where they deliver their products, are information they want to keep for themselves.
This is a shame because the lack of secondary data sharing, hinders Cross Wrap from potentially
selling additional products that would suit the customer’s needs and Cross Wrap would gain
broader market knowledge”.
Participant 1 assumes that the reluctance of sharing information is due to the hierarchical structure
of companies and the competitive atmosphere. A result of the hierarchical structure is that project
managers often only receive the data that is relevant to complete the installation. Secondary
information is held by people higher up the chain. Another result of the hierarchical structure is that

48

Jens Tuovinen

even though the project leader would have the information, the person would be unsure if he or she
would have the authority to share the information.
Participant 1 tells that deadlines are kept, but during projects, customers often change the dates due
to various reasons, or in some cases, projects are put down without explanation. This is however
quite normal in this business field globally.
The business network with Chinese actors has been useful for Cross Wrap to get new customers.
There have been cases when an acquaintance has been able to give the right contact information of
a person who is responsible for sales in a multinational corporation. Hence, the initial discussion
with the customer has been smooth and rapid which would otherwise have been challenging, due to
the size of the multinational corporation. Participant 1 explains that customers have become more
open once trust is built. Participant 1 has encountered Chinese customers that initially have been
reserved, but once trust is built have shared information on their initiative. Participant 1 feels that
Chinese actors are very loyal to their partners after a strong trust is established. Currently, there are
some Chinese customers with whom Cross Wrap is negotiating for further sales after the initial one.
Cross Wrap is mostly independent regarding its sales hence, exporting to China has some
challenges. The most important ones are the hierarchical structure of companies and the existing
language barrier. Besides that, the company’s operations are quite straightforward. In Cross Wrap’s
contracts, it is always mentioned that the customer takes care of customs operations. This makes the
exporting process more efficient and easier for Cross Wrap. Chinese customers have sometimes
certain demands regarding the contract, which need to be negotiated for quite a long time. There are
often disputes, which country's conditions should be implemented. Chinese people want it to be
kept in China, but it has always been managed to be negotiated into a neutral country, such as
Singapore. Regarding the hierarchical structure of Chinese companies, Participant 1 states:
“It can be challenging that the person who you have been negotiating with does not have the
authority to be flexible and can only follow orders from persons higher up within the hierarchy.
This can lead to confusion because it is hard to get direct answers and the negotiation does not
develop further”.
Another challenge Cross Wrap has faced is that Chinese companies are more reluctant to share
information than European companies. They offer essential information needed to complete the
installation, but often they do not want to share any additional information regarding their projects.
Participant 1 thinks that this could be due to their competitive business culture, or their uncertainty

49

Jens Tuovinen

regarding if they can fully trust the counterpart and fears that the sensitive information could get
leaked to third parties.

4.1.5 Effects of China’s environmental investments and Covid-19
Cross Wrap started exporting to developed countries because waste management is not as essential
in developing countries. Furthermore, they do not have as many financial resources as developed
countries. Cross Wrap has not yet been exporting to Africa due to lacking interest from the
customers. As nations develop, their governments start to take action to improve the country’s
waste management. China has experienced rapid economic growth and has become an important
market for Cross Wrap. According to Participant 1:
“China has become an essential customer as a result of its growth. Hence, they have the interest to
improve their waste management. The target country needs to push for a change before it is
profitable to export there. “
Currently, the Taiwanese government is pushing its domestic companies to improve their waste
management.
A big effect of the pandemic is that all bigger events have been postponed. IFAT, which is the
biggest event within the field, held every other year in Germany, has been postponed further a few
times already. It is unclear how many exhibitors and visitors will participate in future events. Cross
Wrap participated in 10 or more events yearly. Participant 1 thinks that certain events will become
unprofitable and laid down in the future, but that the biggest events such as IFAT will stay relevant.
However, Participant 1 mentions that it is hard to know what the future will bring, and it could turn
out that people are more willing to attend events and see each other face-to-face after all the
traveling restrictions that the pandemic has caused. Before the pandemic struck, events were an
essential location to establish the initial contact. Nowadays, it has been substituted digitally with
platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Participant 1 sees that encounters will move more
into digital marketing and virtual seminars. Probably live events will be held but in a lower number.
If the number of exhibitors will decrease exponentially at events, then there will be fewer customers
visiting, resulting in, that it will not profitable to take part in the events. Participant 1 states that it
all depends on customer behavior. If the customer feels that the first contact can be established
digitally, then it could become the new norm, to meet face-to-face after the digitally established
encounter. It is hard to tell how things will develop in the future, and if events will be relevant or
50

Jens Tuovinen

become obsolete. Another potential change regarding events could be that they would narrow down
to field-specific themes and topics. Participant 1 states that a result of the pandemic is those
customer meetings that can be held digitally will remain in that way, hence, decreasing unnecessary
traveling. Cross Wrap has increased its usage of digital tools drastically. Participant 1 explains
“A big change within Cross Wrap is that digital meetings were held approximately once a week and
nowadays it is daily”.
During the pandemic, Cross Wrap has managed to have final negotiations through Microsoft
Teams. Despite the benefits digitalization has brought, Participant 1, as sales manager, points out
the importance of seeing the person face-to-face, being able to read the person’s body language in
full, and view the customer’s reactions. Participant 1 also mentions another challenge regarding
digital platforms. Before the pandemic, events offered an avenue to meet all actors at one place,
whereas, it is not possible to be in touch the same way through digital platforms. It is more timeconsuming to arrange meetings individualistically, and more challenging to meet persons that are
not that close to you. Furthermore, it is easier to show a concept with a pen and paper when you
meet someone face-to-face than it is virtually. Digital marketing is a useful way for Cross Wrap to
get new contacts, which has become more used during the pandemic. Because normal events were
closed, Cross Wrap started to launch webinars. Cross Wrap strives to activate its current customers
and gain new ones through that action.

4.2

Case company: Vaisala Corporation

4.2.1 Company background
In 1931, Professor Vilho Väisälä discovered a fallen Russian radiosonde. He admired its idea to use
radio technology to retrieve observation results. However, he decided to improve it to his quality
standards. In 1936 he finalized his famous innovation, founded Vaisala, and sold the first
radiosonde pieces to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Today, Vaisala is a global leader in weather, environmental, and industrial measurements,
headquartered in Vantaa, Finland. Vaisala strives strongly towards its mission of “Observation for a
better world”. The company is a reliable partner for customers around the world and offers a wide
range of innovative observation and measurement products and services.

51

Jens Tuovinen

Vaisala’s business operations are divided into two sections. Firstly, it manufactures measuring
instruments and systems for various industries. Secondly, it produces weather as well as
environmental prognoses. In the industry sector, it measures factors such as humidity and carbon
dioxide.
Vaisala has 30 offices globally, in 2019, the average number of employees was 1900 and net sales
were over 400 million euros (Vaisala.com).
Vaisala started its exporting straight away from its launch in 1936. Its first customer was the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The share of the Finnish market equals currently 3 – 4 %.
Participant 2; Vice President, Industrial Measurements APAC explains that Vaisala differentiates
itself from its competitors by being the global market leader, and by having the best products within
its field by all standards.

4.2.2 Entry to the Chinese market
The company started exporting to China in 1994 through its subsidiary that opened an office there.
Vaisala created directly strong relationships in China. Participant 2 states:
“We sought Chinese sellers and distributor partners when we expanded here, and we have been
running the business jointly with them since then to this day.”
As time has passed the relationships have evolved. Vaisala has aimed to have long term-partners
and has worked together since the 90s with certain actors. Trust-building is important for the
company. Participant 2 explains:
“Trust is built when the partner notices that we deliver a product which is fully operational and
flawless, and we are willing to offer our support as quickly as possible when something
unpredictable occurs”.

4.2.3 Utilization of existing networks, experience, and knowledge
Vaisala sells components, hence it is beneficial for it to have channel partners that have wide
networks. Delivering components does not cause any problems with the trade, because it is only a
small part of the customers’ machinery. Hence, it is very transactional and straightforward.
Regarding Vaisala’s partners, Participant 2 explains:
52

Jens Tuovinen

“We have channel partners and distributors because they have built a wide network and offer
various products to the same customer. They can offer prospects that we would not otherwise find.
When we want to internationalize to a certain province, we seek a useful distributor. Our
distribution channel network and our own sales team’s channel contacts are used to find new
customers”.

4.2.4 Characteristics networking with Chinese actors and market challenges
Regarding customer relationships within China, Participant 2 states:
“Customer relationships are essential. Oftentimes you can do business with the same actors for
over 10 years. It is a dynamic market, where companies go under rapidly. It is also an enormous
market with different segments”.
Deadlines in China have caused challenges to a certain degree. Participant 2 explains:
“Big companies give surprising predictions for the projects when the product needs to be delivered.
The short deadlines can sometimes make the cooperation a bit challenging for the supplier”.
International events have been relatively useful for Vaisala. The Characteristics of an event are
however important. Participant 2 tells:
“We have sometimes created encounters with interesting actors. Events vary a lot. Generally, a
small event with a narrow theme is a lot better than a bigger event where the theme is broader”.
For Vaisala, the international events have been a good way to build up the brand by showing
externally that the company is active. It has also been a good way to find interesting contacts. They
have been able to find some suiting channel partners, distributors, and leads from various events.
The language barrier has been a huge problem with Chinese exhibitors because they do not often
talk English that well. Hence, it has been useful for Vaisala to have a person that is fluent in
Chinese and can network with them. According to Participant 2, Chinese people are as easy as
anyone else to establish contact with, if the discussion is preferably in Chinese. All in all,
international events are not that essential for Vaisala’s internationalization, they are mostly only a
networking tool.
China is a growing market, and therefore Vaisala strives to increase its presence there. Participant 2
says that terms of trade are different, and you often need middlemen that take a remarkable share of

53

Jens Tuovinen

the profit. All in all, Participant 2 feels that business is business universally, which means you need
to have a product or service that stands out and has a competitive advantage.

4.2.5 Effects of China’s renewable energy investments and Covid-19
China’s renewable energy initiatives and investments have been beneficial for Vaisala. The
increased amount of wind energy projects has offered Vaisala new projects. The company has also
benefited from stricter environmental policies regarding flue gas.
Participant 2 tells that when the pandemic struck, everything stagnated in China, and all the projects
were postponed. Participant 2 explains that China’s industry is dependent on external markets and
the global market situation is reflected in China. Currently, the market has begun operating quite
stably again, but the industry is not growing yet as rapidly as before the pandemic. The usage of
digital networking tools has increased within the company, both internally and externally.
Additionally, more webinars have been launched, Participant 2 states:
“We have increased webinars and online tools with distributors regarding training and information
sharing. We have however held a lot of webinars before the pandemic also”.

Case company: Wetend Technologies Ltd

4.3.1 Company background
Wetend Technologies Ltd is the global technology leader in mixing chemicals, additives, and gases
into high-volume process streams. The company has set business objects to improve paper, board,
and tissue making process chemistry by new innovative mechanical ways. Wetend has been able to
develop new pioneering technologies and new remarkable solutions that distinctly have changed the
way of thinking about how to run a process. It has been accomplished by questioning present
traditional solutions. The company was founded in Finland in 2001 and is now operating globally
with its experienced personnel and representatives. The company is located in the city of
Savonlinna in eastern Finland, where it holds office and shop premises, and modern facilities for
process and product development. Wetend has also had since 2006 an office in Beijing, China. The
company has supplied over 530 mixing installations to 25 countries (Wetend.com).

54

Jens Tuovinen

The company stands out from its competition by its innovative technology, which blends various
additives and chemicals with fibrous materials such as board and provides significant savings in
pulp, paper, and board industries. This technology and all its products are protected by numerous
international patents and patent applications. Furthermore, a strength of the company is the number
of references it has.
Wetend’s technology, reduces process chemical consumption by 30 – 60 %, sometimes even more.
Today, it saves approximately, 70 million m3 of fresh water every year. Additionally, it saves 3,2
million MWh of energy, with a reduction of 2 million tons of carbon dioxide gas annually.

4.3.2 Entry to the Chinese market
Only two years after its foundation, the company expanded to China. Participant 3, CEO of Wetend,
has a background working in the pulp & paper industry, in the Finnish company Metso. With
Participant 3’s previously gained experience and network, the company managed to get its first deal
in China, which was UPM, a Finnish leading company in forest-based bioindustry. Initially,
Wetend’s internationalization strategy to China was to use a Chinese agent. The decision was
however unsuccessful. There were instances when the Finnish managers arrived in China, they
expected that the agent would have been in contact with potential customers and established a
contact with them. It quickly turned out, that it was not the case, and it revealed that the agent had
not done a lot for Wetend. Participant 3 feels that the failed cooperation could have been due to a
few different reasons. Firstly, agents generally have many customers, hence, an individual company
does not get a lot of attention. Secondly, the communication had not been optimal, and it had caused
misunderstandings. Thirdly, Participant 3 feels they could have hired a more competent agent.

4.3.3 Utilization of existing networks, experience, and knowledge
Participant 3 knew a Chinese represent that worked for other Finnish paper companies operating in
China at the time. Participant 3 suggested that they should cooperate and that she would be a
suitable fit to represent Wetend. That led the ball rolling and resulted in that Wetend established a
representative office in Beijing. Participant 3 states:
“It turned things around. The operations in China surged up drastically. The representative
managed to establish contact with various companies that ended up becoming customers. When
Finnish managers now arrived in China, the representative had managed to get the managers from
55

Jens Tuovinen

the potential customer firm to pick them up from the airport and they showed them gladly around
the factory”.
After Participant 3’s partner sold his shares to the representative, it further optimized the
cooperation. Participant 3 explains the positive outcome:
“Now, the representative had the authority to sign deals, which resulted in that customers respected
her legitimacy and authority more. Another positive outcome was that managers from Wetend did
not have to travel to China to sign a deal. Hence, the company’s operation became a lot more
effective by saving time and travel expenses”.
The representative in Beijing and her team, operating from the company’s office, is responsible for
customer relationships, finding new prospects, and dealing with distributors.
As time has passed the cooperation has evolved and Participant 3 has now known the Chinese
representative for over 40 years. The successful relationship has deepened through trust and
commitment.
International events have also been successful. Generally, the representative is socializing with the
attendees and convincing them to stop by the stand. At the stand, managers are describing their
products and how the technology works. International events have been for Wetend a beneficial
venue for brand-building. Events have also been a useful tool to socialize with different actors in
the field.
Wetend has established a cooperation deal with Valmet, which is a leading global developer and
supplier of technologies, automation, and services for the pulp, paper, and energy industries. The
Finnish company employs over 14 000 professionals around the world. Wetend installs their
technology in all of Valmet’s new factories. Through the partnership, every Valmet factory in China
has implemented technology from Wetend.
In 2008, the company received from the People’s Republic of China as the first Western company a
“Golden Bridge Technology” award and the following year “The Most Sustainable Project” award.
The awards assisted the representative to gain new customers and it further builds up the company’s
brand and proved that it was a relevant actor within the market.

56

4.3.4 Characteristics networking with Chinese actors and market challenges
Besides the language barrier in China, Wetend has faced problems regarding copying. Participant 3
explains that a few Chinese companies have made cheaper replicas of their products. They have
then sold the products to Chinese customers. The technology has however been insufficient and
resulted in that the Chinese actors have bought Wetend’s product in the end. One company that
copied the technology even used pictures taken from Wetend’s factory in Finland, where the
product was shown. Participant 3 explains that the situation has improved because of stricter
international laws. Participant 3 tells:
“The way Chinese people view copying differs from the western culture. They do not see it as a
negative aspect or something shameful, rather as profitable. They view it as beneficial if you can
manufacture a similar product for a cheaper cost production”.
During the cases when Wetend’s technology was copied, they contacted their lawyer which resulted
in that the actors who copied had to stop selling the replicated version.
Participant 3 states that Chinese people view face-to-face meetings as important, and using
Microsoft Teams which the company has increased to implement due to Covid is in that sense a
lacking tool. Chinese customers often hesitate to share any additional information that could be
beneficial for the project. Participant 3 however states that it is quite normal globally in the field to
only share the most essential information that is needed for the project to be completed.

4.3.5 Effects of China’s environmental investments of Covid-19
China’s environmental investments have offered an increasing number of projects for the company.
As a result of the pandemic, Wetend has drastically increased their usage of web communication
tools, mostly Microsoft Teams.

4.4

Case company: Roboride Ltd

4.4.1 Company background
Roboride was founded in 2017 in the city of Tampere. The company is an autonomous
transportation services operator. Robo last-mile transportation services make sustainable and smart
mobility possible in places such as campuses, holiday resorts, industrial parks, or by functioning as
57

Jens Tuovinen

an extension of public transportation. Robo service is based on the on-demand operational model,
that optimizes usage of vehicles. Roboride is a service provider, not a developer of technologies.
The company offers its customers a transport solution, based on autonomous vehicles with a
turnkey solution, for the first and last mile. Because Roboride is not stuck to certain manufacturers
or technology suppliers, they can choose the best solutions on the market and develop a service that
fits the customer’s needs.
The business is part of a large global change that megatrends regulate. Urbanization, climate
change, and technological solutions have increased electrified traffic, which will eventually make
traditional transportation obsolete.
Roboride is operating worldwide with its first commercial trial sites in Europe, China, and India. Its
goal is to develop smart cities and to reduce traffic together with cities and municipalities, by
offering flexible and reliable services.
Robos are so-called slow vehicles. They are by EU standard categorized as L7. This regulates the
maximum weight and the number of passengers. Robos have a safety system that identifies a
volatile situation and activates an emergency stop when needed. Technical Research Centre in
Finland (VTT) is functioning as the company’s safety and testing partner in Finland
(Roboride.com).
Participant 4 explains that Roboride differs from its competitors by being purely an operator, which
is offering first and last-mile transportation service. Other companies have primarily developed a
technological platform, but they are not operating the business themselves. In general, solely
developing the platform has not been profitable on the market. With the business model Roboride
implements, the customer pays a monthly fee for a full service. The turnkey solution means that
Roboride is fully responsible for the operation by building a remote monitoring center and offering
vehicles that are fully maintained by being registered, insured, charged, and washed.
Vehicles used are meant for a few kilometer-long distances. The speed is 20 – 40 kilometers in an
hour. There are a few competitors, but they are using vehicles in other categories that can go as fast
as normal cars. Because of the high speed, they are more dangerous in the traffic due to the lacking
technology.
Roboride is currently the global market leader in its field. The company already meets the EU’s
‘Clean Vehicles Directive’ standards. Participant 4 believes the competition will increase in the

58

Jens Tuovinen

future because urbanization is a global megatrend. Integrating automated vehicles deeply with highcapacity public transportation will decrease people’s need to own a car.

4.4.2 Entry to the Chinese market
The company’s first global deployment was with a Chinese holiday resort near the great Beijing
Area. The agreement was signed in 2018. The catalyst for the deployment was Honkarakenne, a
Finnish company that is a pioneer in the construction of log houses. Participant 4 explains:
“They were selling holiday cottages to the resort when the customer asked them to recommend
other innovative Finnish companies to partner with and to further make the resort more attractive.
Hence, by being a common acquaintance to us, they functioned as the middleman, and the contact
with the Chinese customer was established”. After meeting with the customer and initiating
negotiations, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed, whereafter, a commercial agreement
was written.
The cooperation with the customer has been successful. Due to Covid-19’s travel restrictions, the
delivery has however been postponed but the project will be finished and fully operating in 2021.
The legislation regarding autonomous vehicles is notably stricter in China than in Finland.
Importation of vehicles outside of China is highly regulated, and especially sections of the law
regarding customs operations differ greatly from Europe. It is also difficult to get directly in touch
with transport authorities, whereas in Finland you can call them. Roboride has had a good
relationship with Traficom in Finland from the very beginning, which has simplified operations
domestically.
In Finland, it is allowed to put an autonomous vehicle on a public road if the driver holds a driver’s
license. The driver does not need to be inside of the vehicle to control it. In the rest of Europe
however, the law differs, and the driver must be inside the vehicle for it to be lawful. This has led
the Finnish market to be particularly attractive.

4.4.3 Utilization of existing networks, experience, and knowledge
The company has established its network in China, by the prior individual experiences the team
members have gained through their stay in the country. Participant 4 tells:

59

Jens Tuovinen

“One employee of Roboride has lived over ten years in China and has therefore managed to
establish a broad network. One of the founders lived six years in Beijing and established a rich
network over that period. Furthermore, the person responsible for productization has lived 25 years
in China before moving to Singapore. He is fluent in spoken and written Chinese. The company has
established its network in China through the team's contacts”.
When operating at the resort, the company got in touch with a company that has assisted Roboride
with the local law which differs strongly from the one in Finland. It has led to a close partnership.
Participant 4 states:
“A partner from the Chinese resort who is responsible for all its resources has expertise in the
country’s differing law and has assisted to explain it. Besides grasping the local sections of the law,
the partner has a broad and valuable network. Roboride has acquired through the partner company
all of the necessary human resources, such as remote drivers, project managers, and cleaning
services”.
Roboride has one own employee who is responsible for sales and project deliveries in China.
Currently, the company is focusing on productization and localization of the service completion on
the Chinese market. Towards the end of this year, Roboride strives to launch sales activities more
actively. It will build its own sales organization, and scale it up by region. Participant 4 states:
“China is a large market and we will start operating at certain provinces where we already have
valid leads. We have created a good pipeline from our prior sales in China. The parent company of
the holiday resort that we made a commercial agreement with, owns 30 additional resorts, which is
an extremely good addition for future sales growth”.
Participant 4 explains that Hebei Orenda Tourism Developing Co. Ltd, the holiday resort developer
is a partner where the relationship has deepened through trust and commitment. It is a relationship
where both parties have incentives to nourish the partnership. Roboride has already delivered its
vehicles and has them fully operational in one of the resorts of Haituo Valley (subsidiary to Hebei
Orenda). The valley has five different resorts, and Roboride is currently building its operations to
the second one. The plan is to grow and replicate the concept to additional resorts in the valley, and
thereafter, to other resorts owned by Hebeir Orenda.
The next action steps Roboride will take to increase its presence in the Chinese market are to open
an office, hire more employees, and establish cooperation with universities.

60

Jens Tuovinen

The Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China (MOST) has also
shown interest that they would be keen to cooperate with the company. MOST operates similarly as
VTT in Finland, with which Roboride has a close relationship.
Another partner that is based on strong trust is the resource company mentioned earlier in the text.
Roboride has joint plans with them and they will assist with the sales resourcing in the future.
The company’s business model is a type of consultancy project where the level of service is defined
with the customer. First, the security analysis is made in the area, whereafter, Roboride
recommends to the customer what kind of vehicle would be suitable to use, the number of vehicles
needed, a smart route to choose, and how to implement the service in combination with existing
public transport.
Secondly, if the customer wants to move forward, a deployment project is launched, which involves
testing, fine-tuning, securing the safety, and building of the infrastructure. Thereafter it is no longer
a consultancy project but instead a pure service that can be delivered.
Due to the nature of the business model, where the level of service is discussed and determined
together with the customer, Roboride is independently in charge of its sales operations. As an
operator in cities, the company is responsible for the safety aspect. Hence, a third party cannot
manage the operations, because it is Roboride’s liability to be part of the area planning and
implementing a thorough safety analysis before it can initiate operating.

4.4.4 Characteristics networking with Chinese actors and market challenges
Participant 4 explains that Chinese partners have helped to gain new customers and provide
otherwise useful contacts, and he feels sure they will do so even more in the future. The partners
have also shared knowledge about the Chinese market to an extent, but Roboride has mostly got
familiar with the market by participating in various events and looking up different researches.
Participant 4 tells that the factors that have caused the biggest challenges in networking with
Chinese actors, have been cultural differences and establishing trust with local actors, which takes
more time to establish than with Finnish ones. Building a strong foundation of trust is essential in
Chinese culture, and it is important to have common acquaintances who can introduce people to
each other. Hence, it is essential to establish relationships with valuable actors. Another challenge
has been the language barrier, due to Chinese people’s lacking English skills. Therefore, the
company has needed an interpreter for every meeting.
61

Jens Tuovinen

4.4.5 Effects of China’s environmental investments and Covid-19
Roboride feels strongly that China’s renewable energy initiatives and investments have had a
positive impact on the company. Besides China, it continually receives customer contacts from
Europe and India. The interest is growing exponentially. Market research predictions have shown
that the market will open globally in 2025. By then in cities, there will be a revolution in the
movement of people. Private car ownership will highly be replaced with transportation as a service
type of movement.
The pandemic has affected the business in China by delaying product deliveries and made it
difficult to complete projects. The company has before the pandemic used actively Microsoft
Teams, because the organization is scattered around the world. There are employees in Finland,
Germany, China, and Singapore. However, because of the pandemic, the usage rate of Microsoft
teams has increased with customers and partners due to the imposed travel restrictions and
lockdowns.

4.5

Case company: Glaston Corporation

4.5.1 Company background
Hammaren & Co.was founded in 1870 when Lars Johan Hammarén and Gustaf Oscar Sumelius
bought a cotton mill. In 1878, they launched a paper mill in Kyrökoski, Finland. In 1941 The
company’s name was changed to Oy Kyro Ab. The company acquired in 1981 the entire share stock
of Tamglass Oy, which was founded in 1970 and specialized in windshield bending and lamination.
In 1997, the Kyro Group’s parent company was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Kyro
acquired in 2003 Z. Bavelloni that spezialiced in Pre-Processing machines. In 2007, the company’s
name was changed to Glaston Corporation and in 2019, the company acquired Bystronic glass
(glaston.net).
Glaston’s mission is to make the customer’s glass outstanding by providing machinery, technology,
and expertise. It strives to achieve success in the customer’s chosen area of glass processing. The
company is passionate about innovating the next level in world-class technology, dedicated
services, and technical support so that the customer gets the highest production energy efficiency
and best glass quality. The headquarters of Glaston Corporation is in Helsinki. The production of
62

Jens Tuovinen

heat-treated glass machinery is concentrated in Finland, whereas the production of insulating glass
machinery is concentrated in Germany. The facility in Switzerland is responsible for the automotive
industry and display technology machinery (Glaston.net).
Participant 5 states that Glaston is one of the market leaders in glass processing. They have one
similar-sized Austrian competitor named LiSEC, whose turnover is also a few hundred million
euros. The company’s technology is superior, and they have always invested in it. Furthermore,
Glaston is the market leader in heat-treated glass, second positioned in insulating glazing and firstor second positioned in vehicle glazing, competing tightly with one Japanese competitor named
Panda.
The company has plenty of patents that protect the innovative technology which is utilized. Glaston
has a global service network, which makes it possible to serve the customer closely and efficiently.
Customers are industrial; hence it is crucial for them that the machines are functioning properly.

4.5.2 Entry to the Chinese market
Glaston’s first deliveries to China occurred at the beginning of the 90s. Initially, the company used
a network of agents. It made it possible to overcome the language barrier, which was a big
challenge back then, because of the Chinese lacking skills in English. Thereafter, the company hired
facilities and in 2001, the construction of the first factory begun, in Tianjin, and in 2005-06 it was
finished, and the production began.

4.5.3 Utilization of existing networks, experience, and knowledge
Glaston was one of the first foreign companies in Tianjin and they initially established a close
relationship with the local government. Participant 5 states:
“We must maintain a stable and productive relationship with the local government. Plenty of issues
are decided and settled by local agreements compared to other countries”.
The company has managed to create a business network in China through different means.
Participant 5 tells:
“Glaston managed to build up its business network in China in the beginning through their agents.
When constructing the factory in Tianjin, the company formed relationships with various local

63

Jens Tuovinen

actors. Furthermore, the glass industry is globally quite integrated, hence, actors often know each
other, which has made it easier to find suitable partners around the world. Business events have
also been an essential tool to meet interesting actors”.
The network is utilized for sales operations, which the company runs independently in China. A
local team is also in charge of marketing, and they utilize effectively all the channels that the
Chinese customers prefer to use. The company is in contact with various actors within the glass
industry such as raw material manufacturers and suppliers. Because Glaston is within its field one
of the biggest machine suppliers globally and in China, it can effectively use its network to get in
touch with fitting actors. Furthermore, the company has annually attended China International Glass
Industrial Technical Exhibition, which is the most commercially valuable exhibition in China’s
glass industry. The exhibition, which was postponed in 2020 because of the virus, has been an
effective way to get in touch with prospects.
Glaston has formed long-term relationships with customers from the construction field, that are
market leaders. For instance, the company’s machinery and technology were utilized for the
construction of the Shanghai Tower and the skyscrapers around it.

4.5.4 Characteristics networking with Chinese actors and market challenges
China is a challenging environment because you must continually be able to prove the superiority of
your product. Furthermore, copying is a big problem, although the situation has improved. It is
however viewed by the copier as a gesture of admiration, that the products are efficient. One thing
that goes hand in hand with copying, is that patents are also quite difficult to protect. The company
has operated for a long time on the Chinese market and globally, hence there are not particular
major challenges that occur on the market.

4.5.5 Effects of China’s renewable energy investments and Covid-19
The company has benefited from China’s renewable energy investments. Insulating glazing is
energy-friendly and the demand has increased steadily in that field. Furthermore, because of
China’s heavy investments in solar energy, the demand for solar panel-glazing has drastically
surged. The market is attractive, because of its large size, the competition is however strongly pricedriven. Hence, it is crucial to be able to justify the company’s strengths to the customers.

64

Jens Tuovinen

In 2020 during the Chinese new year, Glaston had to close their factory for a few weeks, because of
Covid-19. Due to the comprehensive local sales network around the national market, the travel
restrictions within China did not have a strong impact on the sales and service operations. Because
Glaston has established its presence and operations on the market, it could minimize the negative
effects of the virus. Because of the pandemic, the company has learned and increased its usage of
Microsoft Teams, which participant 5 views as a particularly important tool for the organization,
which is spread globally. It will probably replace several pre-pandemic necessary travels in the
future.

5. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The following chapter presents and summarizes the obtained results from the conducted study.
First, an analysis of the descriptive information is provided (section 5.1), followed by the research
questions being answered by the theoretical literature and qualitative data analysis results from the
case interviews (section 5.2).

5.1

Descriptive analysis

The pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus has further changed the global environment and
reinforced the need for updated internationalization models such as the parachuting
internationalization model. It is a suitable model because it emphasizes the need to plan for
unexpected market changes and to be able to rapidly adapt to them. The small market size of
Finland had mostly functioned as the catalyst for the internationalization of the case companies,
which has characteristics of the Born Global model, where the company has from its inception
decided to expand globally. Market entry had not been dependable on psychic distance as the
Uppsala model states. Rather, physical characteristics of the product and the alignment of a soft- or
hard service had been more important. The reasoning will further be gone through in the third
research question. China’s environmental policies had affected all the case companies positively by
increasing demand. All the interviewees noted certain cultural characteristics within Chinese
business actors that can be viewed from the lens of guanxi. The interviewees explained challenges
consisting of establishing trust, which required a lot of commitment, Chinese actors’ preference for
face-to-face meetings, the hierarchical structure, and Chinese actors’ reluctance to share
information. It was emphasized that Chinese actors were loyal and open after a deep trust was
65

Jens Tuovinen

established. An interesting phenomenon is that traditional Chinese values such as guanxi and mianzi
are still essential in the Chinese society and that these traditional values coexist with western and
capitalistic values, which makes the parachuting internationalization strategy beneficial because it
views culture from a yin and yang perspective, where old and new beliefs coexist. The fourth
research question will further analyze how guanxi had affected the internationalization of the case
companies.

5.2

Results and answers to the research questions

RQ1: How has parachuting internationalization been presented as a way for a firm to expand to
new markets?
The parachuting internationalization strategy was created because of changes occurring in the
global market environment. The rise of the digital revolution, the liberalization of the cross-border
market, and technological innovations are developments that have been taken place in the past
decades. These changes have resulted in “boundarylessness” in cultural learning, synchronized
information sharing across nations and peoples, knowledge transfer. Therefore, the impact of the
psychic distance between the domestic country and target countries is not as strong as 15 to 20
years ago. Hence, trends and values spread across international borders, which has led to profitable
opportunities for firms to expand to markets that have been out of reach before.
Fang, et al (2017) researched four Scandinavian firms’ foreign market entry into China. The
parachuting internationalization metaphor was inspired by the broad description provided by some
of the respondents, which the researchers linked to parachuting jumps in military operations. The
model views internationalization from the lens of a special operations paratrooper, who has to know
the terrain which is the market, and take all factors into account that could jeopardize the operation,
and be able to adjust to the changes occurring in the environment, which is an analogy for the risks
that the firm faces in the new market and the skill to be able to rapidly adapt to appearing marketthreats. The model integrates the Uppsala model and the Born Global model to show that firms can
achieve success in the age of globalization by using creative strategies. Firms can strive, by viewing
the culture from a Yin and Yang perspective instead of Hofstede’s paradigm from 1980, which was
written before the Internet. The model consists of a dynamic worldview and can manage paradoxes
across organizational functioning, which enables it to mix crucial elements from the classical
models.
66

Jens Tuovinen

The strategy is based on themes consisting of the importance of knowledge, learning, and
commitment, which are characteristics associated with the Uppsala model, customer focus
regardless of geographic location, which is essential for the Born Global model, need for speed,
reduced salience of psychic distance and national cultural learning and balancing in globalization.
“Parachuting” is ideal for high risk and high yield markets, where the firm’s strategic assets are its
global vision and strong commitment to learn and build know-how continuously through
relationships and networks in the target market. The model does not ignore cultural differences,
rather they are viewed through globalization and the dynamic changes they result in. Furthermore,
the model emphasizes the need for a firm to be aggressive and rapid in its internationalization.
Stage-skipping, which is contradictory to the Uppsala model can be achieved when the target
market has information technology such as the internet and when there is tough competition.
GLOCAL is a shortening of the keywords that are required to achieve parachuting successfully.

RQ2: How did Finnish companies implement a GLOCAL strategy for parachuting
internationalization to China?
GLOCAL is an acronym shortened from:
G -global vision
L - location
O – opportunity
C – capital and other resources to support globalization efforts
A – accelerated cultural learning and swift action
L – logistics preparation and meticulous planning
Cross Wrap had from its inception a clear global vision. The company knew it had to
internationalize because of Finland’s small market size and the inefficient demand domestically.
Hence, the company started to build up its global business network and its reputation by having the
customer in focus. Cross Wrap became known as a reliable actor by tailor-making the machinery to
each customer and gaining references. The decision to expand to China was enabled as a result of a
global trend because the government of China had implemented policies to become more
environmentally friendly. The market’s demand surged, and Cross Wrap operated rapidly to
67

Jens Tuovinen

capitalize on it. Cross Wrap is continuously scanning for new market opportunities globally and is
currently observing the Taiwanese government, which is pushing its domestic companies to
improve their waste management.
The company viewed a market gap for its machinery and could meet the needs of the local
customers. Hence, the factor of location was also achieved. Cross Wrap grasped the opportunity
that the Chinese market offered by a few different means. They gathered knowledge from its broad
network, they noticed an increasing presence, interest, and demand from Chinese actors on business
exhibitions, and they followed up on the policies put in place by the Chinese government. The
machinery Cross Wrap offers is a niche product, hence, the Chinese market is lucrative because of
its large size. Through its existence, Cross Wrap has obtained capital and other resources to
support globalization efforts. The differing bale wrapping technique and the parts in the machinery
have patents safeguarding it, which creates a stable competitional advantage for the company.
Furthermore, the reputation which has gradually been built up by establishing close long-term
customer relationships and actively attending business exhibitions has solidified the company as a
reliable actor on the market, which eases the process of gaining new prospects and customers.
Although the company oversees its sales operations, it has built up long-term relationships with
agents that often contact the company because of its trustworthy reputation. In such cases, the
agents deliver the machine to the end customer although they do not obtain exclusive rights. Cross
Wrap has also gained in-depth market knowledge by operating independently and from the network,
it has benefited from. China’s environmental policies are to a degree a result of globalization and
the accelerated cultural learning that has occurred in the past few decades. China wants to be
represented globally as an environmentally friendly country and the megatrend of ecological
sustainability offered Cross wrap to take swift action and penetrate the market by working closely
with its Chinese customers. The company has executed a thorough logistics preparation and
meticulous planning. As a result of Covid-19, the company has started to launch webinars and
increased drastically its use of web conferencing software. The increased presence online represents
the “parachuting” metaphor and the flexibility of the Yin and Yang, where the paratrooper must be
able to quickly adjust to unexpected changes. Furthermore, it is always stated in Cross Wrap’s
contracts, that the customer takes care of customer operations, which functions as a safeguard
because it makes the exporting process as efficient as possible.
Vaisala had initially a global vision, by beginning exporting since its foundation in 1936. A factor
that simplifies the company’s expansion nowadays, is its position as the global market leader in its
field. The company is operating effectively globally and has been in China since 1994. Because of
68

Vaisala’s market-leading position, being active in China is self-evident. Hence, the factor of
location is achieved strongly. Vaisala seized the opportunity, by directly creating a subsidiary and
establishing effective long-term relationships with Chinese sellers and distributors, with whom it
has been running the operations jointly. One of the most essential resources of the company is its
tightly knitted network. The importance of creating long-term relationships with successful channel
partners has been crucial because the company sells components, which are as a product
transactional and straightforward. Furthermore, the company’s reputation has been an important
resource, hence the company put substantial effort to offer flawless products and is quick to offer its
assistance to its partners when needed. Business exhibitions have also been useful for the company,
but not as strongly as for Cross Wrap. They have mainly functioned as a tool to build up Vaisala’s
brand and seek channel partners, which the company’s operation model is strongly built upon.
Vaisala’s net sales were over 400 million euros in 2019, hence the capital obtained makes it easier
to find suitable partners, and to act to unexpected events occurring on the market. The element of
accelerated cultural learning and swift action has not been essential in internationalization. Firstly,
because the company expanded to China before the Internet had become a major phenomenon and
secondly because the company sells components, which is not a trend product. Vaisala has operated
following the element of logistics preparation and meticulous planning by initially creating a
subsidiary and thereafter finding suitable partners. The company has also increased its usage of
webinars and online conferencing software. Vaisala is globally substantially more spread than Cross
Wrap, hence, it had already implemented online tools before the pandemic. An essential element of
Vaisala’s success in its parachuting to the market was its decision to collaborate with a local sales
team. The Chinese channel partners could authentically connect to the target customers and were
able to leverage the content in a way that speaks to the market. Furthermore, Vaisala empowers its
channel partners, by offering its support as quickly as possible when needed.
Wetend has also since its inception had a global vision because it operates in a niche market where
Finland’s demand is too small. The company has been in China since 2006, hence, it viewed the
location as riskier, but potentially as a high yield in its niche market. The company was struggling
initially with the element of opportunity but eventually found a suitable representative to assist in
establishing its position in the market. Wetend’s most crucial resource is its innovative technology,
which is protected by international patents. Its reputation is another resource consisting of a
substantial amount of references and awards received in China. The reputation is further improved
through business exhibitions, where the company has been creating brand awareness. The
partnership with the Chinese partner and the strategic alliance with the Finnish company Valmet,
69

Jens Tuovinen

are essential resources established for operating successfully in China, which has been established
through networking. In common with Vaisala, accelerated cultural learning and swift action have
not been essential for the company’s internationalization to China because of the characteristics of
the product. Wetend took swift action and expanded to China only two years after its foundation.
Although Wetend was struggling somewhat initially with the element of logistics preparation and
meticulous planning, it succeeded to establish a fruitful partnership by having a representative
office and installing its technology in Valmet’s factories. In common with the other case companies,
Wetend has also drastically increased its usage of web conferencing software with Chinese actors
because of the pandemic. The representative’s local knowledge of the market and its ability to adapt
the company’s content to Chinese actors, has played an essential role in Wetend’s implementation
of glocal.
Roboride has had a clear global vision from its inception. The company benefits from sustainable
and smart mobility, which is a global megatrend. The company was founded in 2017 and has
already trial sites in various national markets. The agreement with the Chinese customer was signed
in 2018 just one year after the company was created. The Chinese location has been essential for
Roboride, because of the market’s large size and the environmental policies, which China has
implemented. Roboride saw the opportunity and chose to rapidly enter the Chinese market. To act
quickly has been crucial because the company is a market leader in its field and can therefore
benefit from moving aggressively and expanding its business. The company’s most essential
resources are its diverse network, consisting of domestic and Chinese business actors. The
organization has gained market knowledge, through the team members’ stay in the country, which
varies from 6 – 25 years. During the stay, the members have broadened their network and created
personal contacts. The company’s customers and partners whom Roboride must collaborate closely
with offer valuable market knowledge, which is a highly beneficial resource. Roboride has already
established partnerships in China with a holiday resort and a local resource provider. An additional
resource is the company’s position as a market leader, which has been established by specializing in
a niche field consisting of global megatrends such as urbanization, climate change, and electrified
traffic. Roboride differs from its competitors by being an operator and service provider, in contrast,
to solely a mobility software provider. The company has foreseen the increased competition that
will occur due to urbanization and China’s strict environmental policies regarding mobility. Hence,
the company has taken swift action and has leveraged its position as a market leader, by establishing
its position in the high risk /high yield environment. Roboride is a company that has strongly
benefited from accelerated cultural learning, because of various global megatrends that are
70

Jens Tuovinen

strongly a result of synchronized information sharing, which the Internet has enabled. Logistics
preparation and meticulous planning have been achieved by the partnership established with the
resort developer, which functions as a safeguard because the partnership is comprehensive and will
offer steady sales income through projects implemented in various resorts. Furthermore, the local
human resource provider assists in unexpected changes that could occur. The company has a solid
plan on how to increase its sales operations and commitment in China. Because the company is
working closely with the customer and oversees the safety regulations it can minimize and prevent
any unexpected events. As with Vaisala, Roboride has also actively used web conferencing tools
internally because of the structure of the organization, which is highly scattered globally. However,
as a result of the pandemic, the company has also increased its online meetings with its partners and
customers.
Glaston is a company that has existed for over 150-years. It has achieved its global vision through
acquisitions of various foreign companies, whereafter, Glaston has divided its manufacturing to
different countries. The company has implemented its machinery for the construction of numerous
skyscrapers in China, therefore the location has been lucrative. The element of opportunity has been
achieved by establishing a close relationship with the local government. Glaston’s most valuable
resource is its superior technology, which is protected by various patents. Additionally, the
company is one of the market leaders, which makes expanding-, learning and gaining knowledge
from the market easier because of the broad existing network and the reputation it has built.
Furthermore, customer focus is ingrained in the business strategy, which is executed through a
global service network. This further goes hand in hand with its reputational resource, which the
company has firmly established. As part of its strategy to broaden the network, Glaston has attended
business exhibitions. The company followed the traditional Uppsala internationalization strategy
initially at the beginning of the 1990s when it expanded to China. Glaston used a network of agents
to overcome the language barrier, and gradually increased its commitment to the market by renting
facilities and further on within the expansion by building its factory and establishing its own local
sales team on the market. The element of accelerated cultural learning and swift action has not
been crucial, due to the field that the business is operating in and because of the early expansion to
China, which occurred before the Internet was booming. Globalization and the opening of China’s
market made it possible for Glaston to get a foothold in the market and build its factory. Logistics
preparation and meticulous planning have been achieved by learning and committing gradually to
the market. The company’s stable presence on the market today and the local sales team, function as
safeguards for unexpected changes. Hence, the consequences of Covid-19 were not severe for the
71

Jens Tuovinen

company’s operations in China because the local team could keep the processes going. Glaston’s
local team is responsible for marketing and they utilize effectively all the channels that the Chinese
customers prefer to use, which is crucial in parachuting and in localizing the brand to the target
market.

RQ3: What company characteristics should be considered when a company chooses its entry mode
to the Chinese market?
The research question will strongly be based on Hollensen’s four groups of factors influencing the
entry mode decision.
In the case of Cross Wrap, the company has gradually built up its reputation through various ways
such as customer references and business events. Hence, the company wants to be fully in charge of
its operations. Participant 1 explained that operating independently causes challenges such as the
existing language barrier and the hierarchical structures of companies on the market. Cross Wrap
has however safeguarded its operations by stating in its contracts that the customer oversees
customs operations. Participant 1 stated that Chinese customers generally want to implement
China’s conditions when negotiating the contract, but Cross Wrap has been able to negotiate it into
a neutral country, which follows Williamson’s (1985) statement that the most essential safeguard is
the legal contract. Due to the importance of Cross Wrap’s network the company can function
independently and have full control. Although, being a volatile way to operate the company has
gained experience through the years. Business events have particularly been beneficial for Cross
Wrap to strengthen its network, which has shaped its business strategy and the decision to utilize a
hierarchical mode. The machinery they produce and sell is furthermore essential for their strategy to
be independent. They need to tailor-make the product for every customer’s needs and the quantities
are quite small, which makes using an agent possibly unprofitable. They want to gain market
knowledge from every new country they expand to. Hence, Cross Wrap’s independent entry
characteristics are based on; utilizing and deepening its network, control, the complexity of the
product, and need for market knowledge and international experience. The choice of the company’s
hierarchical mode is strongly based on internal factors and desire mode characteristics (Hollensen,
2017). The managers are however uncertain if they will hire an agent in China with exclusive rights
due to time restraints and the challenge to operate independently, which is an effect of the firm’s
relatively small size, which affects internal factors towards increasing externalization but also an

72

Jens Tuovinen

external factor because of the distance between the home- and the target market and differences in
sociocultural terms (Hollensen, 2017).
Vaisala is an intermediate-sized enterprise and chose to establish a subsidiary in China. They have
outsourced a lot of their operations and they have long-term sellers and distribution partners. The
company sells components; hence, the product is standardized, and it is beneficial for Vaisala to use
distributors and channel partners. The product has been the company’s most essential factor
regarding entry mode decisions.
For Wetend Technologies the founder’s priorly gained rich network had a strong impact regarding
the company’s entry mode. Wetend’s first customer was a Finnish company that participant 3 had
priorly established a good relationship with. The company established a representative office and
was able to hire a local representative that participant 3 knew from before. Participant 3 knew she
was competent from her previous experience representing Finnish companies. Hence, she would be
valuable for the company’s expansion in China. Before establishing the representative office, they
worked with a Chinese agent. The collaboration was unsuccessful, which shows the importance of
choosing a suitable agent and that the product or service is fitting to the agent’s portfolio. The
company furthermore benefited from its network by establishing a strategic alliance with a Finnish
company that is actively operating in China. The reason Wetend chose as its entry mode to establish
a representative office and work closely with one representative was because of the founder’s
priorly established network.
For Roboride, the network has similarly to Wetend Technologies been essential. The operator
managed to get its first Chinese customer through the relationships established with a Finnish
company. Roboride needs to function independently because of its complex service model. The
company must work closely with its customers because the business model is initially a type of
consultancy. Furthermore, Roboride is responsible for the safety aspects. The company has
established strong long-term partnerships in the form of commercial agreements and joint plans
with local actors who assist with sales resourcing.
Characteristics affecting the company’s decision to have a hierarchical mode established is its soft
service, which requires the company to be interacting with the customers. Furthermore, the reason
to establish a greenfield investment is the international experience and the broad network that the
company has with local actors. Partnerships are in a crucial role in the expansion by enabling to
overcome sociocultural differences and decreasing the risk of internationalization by establishing
long-term partnerships. By establishing an office, the company can continue deepening its relations
73

Jens Tuovinen

and developing its productivity and market presence. A combination of Hollensen’s all four groups
of factors has influenced the entry mode.
Glaston Corporation chose to use a network of agents when entering the Chinese market at the
beginning of the 1990s. The reason for the implementation of sales agents was the company’s
lacking language skills in Chinese. Furthermore, Glaston’s size as a company was smaller in the
1990s than nowadays. Hence, using agents was a low-risk decision for the company enabling it to
steadily gain market knowledge and commit to the market, which was achieved by hiring facilities
and eventually through greenfield investment. Therefore, the company’s entry mode using
Hollensen’s model was influenced by internal factors regarding the firm’s smaller size when it
expanded to China. Hence, Glaston used the desired mode characteristic by being risk-averse and
flexible. Furthermore, external factors had a strong impact because of the sociocultural distance
between the home country and the host country.

RQ4: What are the implications of the companies’ business networks, for executing the parachuting
internationalization strategy?
Cross Wrap has created strong business networks with its customers with whom it has cooperated
closely, by tailor-making the machinery to each customer’s need. The high number of customer
references has built up Cross Wrap’s reputation and it has eased the internationalization process.
The company has implemented its business- and a social network consisting of European actors that
have established their presence in China. They have helped by functioning as the initial contact to
the Chinese actors, showing the effect of guanxi, where referrals are shared within the informal
social network. Cross Wrap has created guanxi quite successfully with various actors in China. For
instance, establishing long-term relationships with customers has been possible by jointly building
trust and commitment, which has led Cross Wrap to receive useful contacts and referrals through
which it has gained new customers. Furthermore, agents, Chinese bale manufacturers, and a
European whole supplier who has a resale contract in China are included in Cross Wrap’s business
network. They often refer Cross Wrap’s machinery to their customers, which the company benefits
from. Cross Wrap has implemented the Parachuting Internationalization strategy by having a broad
business network that it has created through business exhibitions and close customer relationships.
Because Chinese actors value face-to-face meetings, business events can be viewed as a valuable
tool to deepen the relationship with them. The reputation Cross Wrap has built up globally has
helped it to be viewed as a reliable partner by Chinese actors, which has eased the process of getting
74

Jens Tuovinen

new prospects and customers on the market where the character trait of being trustworthy is seen as
essential.
Vaisala preferred to create a strong business network with Chinese distributors and sellers when
expanding to China. The company has built guanxi by building gradually trust and working together
with certain actors since the 90s. By having long-term relationships with its channel partners, the
actors have learned how the counterpart operates and the cooperation can function as smoothly as
possible. Because Vaisala sells components the company must cooperate with business actors that
have local knowledge of the market and widely established networks. Business exhibitions have
functioned as a networking tool for Vaisala enabling it to find interesting channel partners.
Participant 3, the founder of Wetend used his business network from the home market to land the
company’s first deal in China, which was UPM, a Finnish company that is specialized in forestbased bioindustry. Thereafter, Wetend hired an agent who turned out to be quite incompetent.
Participant 3 reached out to a representative that the participant knew from before who worked for
other Finnish paper companies. She started to represent Wetend and the relationship has
successfully deepened through trust and commitment. The representative, part of participant 3’s
business- and the social network had deep know-how of the Chinese market and could attract new
customers to the company. A clear result of respecting mianzi, which is the prestige of a person can
be shown when participant 3’s partner sold his shares to the representative. Hence, the
representative had the authority to sign deals and the Chinese business actors respected her
legitimacy more. Furthermore, Wetend as a company showed its trust towards the representative by
the action. The company has established guanxi with the Chinese state by receiving two awards
from the Chinese government. Wetend has benefited from the awards by increasing its reputation
on the market and broadening its business network. Furthermore, Wetend has been able to create a
strategic alliance with the Finnish firm Valmet in China. The company implemented its parachuting
strategy by taking advantage of its business- and social network established in the home market.
Roboride benefited from its business- and social network, which it has established in the home
market. The company was able to get its first customer in China through Honkarakenne, a Finnish
company, that recommended Roboride to its customer in China. Roboride signed thereafter a
Memorandum of Understanding and the relationship has since then gradually deepened. Roboride
will through the strategic alliance be able to install its self-driven vehicles to 30 resorts in total. The
company works very closely with its customers and is, therefore, able to gain a lot of market
knowledge. Roboride’s business network in China has actors from different fields. Currently, it
strives to establish cooperation with universities and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the
75

Jens Tuovinen

People’s Republic of China. If achieved, it would be a prime example of creating guanxi with a
governmental entity. Roboride, which is a startup company represents well the parachuting
internationalization strategy by aggressively taking advantage of global megatrends. The company
has expanded swiftly to the Chinese market and benefited from its domestic business network as
well as its rapidly established relationships in the market, which is a result of building guanxi and
respecting mianzi. The organization’s deep market knowledge gained through the team’s prior
experiences in China and the social networks established has furthermore simplified the
internationalization process to the Chinese market.
Glaston has obtained its business network through acquiring various companies. Furthermore, the
business field is quite integrated, hence, all the major European actors within the glass industry
know each other, which has offered Glaston a broad business network. The company has nourished
its business network and gained new contacts through attending various exhibitions. When
expanding to China at the beginning of the 1990s, the company used agents to overcome the
language barrier. Later, Glaston constructed its factory in Tianjin and broadened its business
network. Hence, the company has mostly implemented the Uppsala internationalization model by
gradually committing to the market and steadily learning from it. Glaston was however one of the
first foreign companies in Tianjin, which shows they moved swiftly to the market, strongly
characterized by the parachuting internationalization strategy. Furthermore, when the factory was
created, close relationships were established with the local government. Glaston is one of the case
companies that has most effectively implemented guanxi on a governmental level. Therefore, it can
be stated, that the company later within its expansion moved towards a parachuting
internationalization strategy. By having a factory in China, the company has encountered business
actors consisting of manufacturers and suppliers. As one of the biggest machine suppliers globally
within its field, Glaston can effectively use its network to get in touch with fitting actors. Hence,
Glaston has over the years built a diverse business network that it can utilize when needed. Glaston
has formed long-term relationships with its customers in China, which has enabled the company to
get a stable position on the market and to receive support from guanxi’s informal social network.
For instance, the Shanghai Tower and the skyscrapers around it have implemented Glaston’s
machinery.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this final chapter, the main findings of the research and managerial implications are discussed,
and the chapter is concluded with limitations and suggestions for future research.

6.1

Main findings

The results from the research revealed that an updated internationalization model such as the
parachuting internationalization strategy is needed in today’s global market environment, which is
rapidly changing. However, certain aspects from the Uppsala model, mainly obtaining market
knowledge remain essential for most companies.
All the case companies succeeded in parachuting internationalization by benefiting from their
business network, which involved actors that could assist in the company’s expansion. The research
shows that Finnish firms can, as successfully as Swedish and Danish firms, implement a
parachuting strategy for their internationalization to China.
The case companies had used to a varying degree a combination of the Uppsala model and the Born
Global approach. In general, older companies that existed before the Internet’s usage had
skyrocketed, initially implemented an Uppsala Internationalization approach by gradually learning
and committing to the market by increasing their resources, which is shown by the fact that certain
case companies that internationalized in the 1990s, gradually changed the mode of operating from
using agents to greenfield investing.
The business network model of the internationalization process by Johanson and Vahlne (2009) was
utilized by the case companies. The model emphasizes the importance of trust and commitment
building. Social capital is crucial in China where Guanxi still strongly exists. The informal social
network enables its actors to share knowledge, which the interviewees viewed as essential to reach
success in the foreign market. The authors explain regarding the model that some types of
knowledge are not available to everyone, and are instead held by network insiders, which is a
suiting representation of Guanxi. However, once trust is established and a person becomes a reliable
member, he or she can obtain the knowledge. Furthermore, some of the case companies established
their first deal in China by benefiting from their business network established on the home market
which was built on trust. The business network model of the internationalization process has
similarities to the Parachuting Internationalization model because both models emphasize the
importance of relationship building.
77

Jens Tuovinen

The network approach developed by Johanson and Matsson (1988) was to a certain degree followed
by the case companies. The model categorizes firms into four groups depending on their size and by
how they benefit from their existing network. The results from the research followed the model,
which can be viewed by smaller size case companies using a substantial number of agents or
representatives, whereas case companies that were bigger internationalized by greenfield
investments and by benefitting from their broad network. The network approach can be linked to
the Parachuting Internationalization model because it explains the importance of firms’ exchange
relationships.
The data shows, that often the business network gained from prior relationships had functioned as
the catalyst for the market entry or enabled the company to get its first sale. The need to tailor-make
the product or service had played an essential role in companies’ entry mode. As a result,
companies chose to oversee their operations and aimed to develop strong relationships with their
customers. Opposite to the former strategy, companies that had standardized products had strived to
find suitable distributors and channel partners when entering the Chinese market. Hence, the
physical characteristics of the product or service of the company were crucial for the
internationalization strategy and the need for intermediaries.

6.2

Managerial implications

Based on the findings of this research, there are some factors managers should consider when
internationalizing to China. Companies can drastically benefit from old cultural values, that strongly
exist in China by being able to establish deep relationships with local actors. In a market such as
China where the local government can freely apply beneficial policies for business actors, the
internationalizing company should strive to show its value and willingness to cooperate by keeping
close ties with legislative decision-makers. By building up guanxi the foreign firms can establish a
competitive advantage by accessing valuable information.
The results were in alignment with prior internationalization literature (Umemoto and Katsuhiro,
2010), (Holmlund and Kock, 1998), (Zhou, et al., 2007,), and (Johanson and Vahlne, 2009), which
states the importance of a business network from the home market can have for an
internationalizing company. The interviewees from this research revealed it in terms of referrals by
the actor from the domestic market, by opportunities to establish strategic alliances, and by the
ability to get a foothold in the market. Hence, a managerial implication is that firms that are

78

Jens Tuovinen

internationalizing to a new market should try to benefit from the business network from the home
market that is already active on the target market.
The foreign firms can strongly benefit from the local sales teams that have a good understanding of
the market. The case companies often preferred to implement local sales teams that had authentic
knowledge of the market, which is associated with parachuting and glocalization, where it is crucial
to adjust the company’s brand to local nuances, dialects, and cultures.
Firms can gain a competitive advantage from technologies that can facilitate communication within
the organization. Because of the pandemic, all the case companies increased their usage of web
conferencing software, which is an element of glocalization. The case companies had benefited
from the technology by using it to bring dispersed teams together, enabling them to work faster,
more productive, and collaboratively. Furthermore, launching online meetings with partners and
employees revealed information about local audiences and helped the teams to offer the right
content to the right people at the right times.
The results showed the importance of creating relationships with suitable actors that could assist in
internationalization. Firms with standardized products benefited from having close relationships
with distributors, whereas firms with highly adapted products strived to cooperate closely with
customers. Having a clear vision of the type of actors that the firm needs to collaborate with when
entering a new market simplifies the process of implementing GLOCAL.

6.3

Limitations and suggestions for future research

This research is limited by its small number of case companies. Some of the case companies had
initiated their internationalization to China at the beginning of the 1990s. Globalization had already
taken place but not the boom of the Internet, which is a strong consequence of the creation of the
parachuting internationalization model because of the increased information-sharing which it has
enabled. These companies showed a more risk-averse and gradual expansion characterized by the
Uppsala Internationalization model. Furthermore, solely Finnish managers had been interviewed for
the study. Hence, the Chinese actors’ opinions and views of the business relationships were not
represented in the research. For future research, it would be fascinating to view the results of
contrary research, by studying the different aspects occurring when Chinese firms internationalize
to Finland.

7. SUMMARY IN SWEDISH
En fallstudie av finska cleantech-företags implementering av GLOCAL för att komma in på den
kinesiska marknaden

7.1

Inledning

Kina blev den största exportören i världen 2009, och etablerade sig året därpå som den näst största
ekonomin i världen. Detta har gjort den kinesiska marknaden mycket lockande för utländska
investeringar. Kina har infört diverse miljöinitiativ de senaste åren och fortsätter starkt att investera
i förnybar energi. Finland har expertis på området att uppnå att uppnå hållbara lösningar för olika
industrier med sitt gröna tänkande, och med sin forskningsmiljö som är i världsklass. Därmed har
flera finska företag de senaste åren etablerat sig på den kinesiska marknaden. På grund av
globalisering och det snabba globala informationsflöde som internet har möjliggjort, behövs nya
sätt att få fotfäste på internationella marknader. Internationella fallskärmsmodellen är en ny strategi
som är baserad på glokalisering. Detta är den lokala dimensionen av globaliseringen, som innebär
att ett företag kan sälja på en global marknad trots att det endast producerar på ett fåtal platser. Den
utvecklades av Fang, et al. 2017 från Stockholm universitet, som forskade om hur svenska samt ett
danskt företag hade expanderat till kinesiska marknaden. Den är i stort sett integrerad från
Uppsalamodellen och Born Global-modellen. Metaforen för fallskärmshoppandet inspirerades av
respondenternas omfattande beskrivningar från den ursprungliga undersökningen. Forskarna
kopplade det till militära operationer, då specialtrupper hoppar med fallskärm vid fiendens front och
agerar raskt där. I dessa fall bör alla oförväntade händelser tas i beaktande på förhand och en
grundlig förberedelse bör göras angående ”terrängen”, en analogi som står för marknaden.
Modellen lägger vikt att skapa kontakter som är användbara. (Fang, et al, 2017). Detta är väsentligt
i Kina där det informella sociala nätverket Guanxi ännu används i stor utsträckning idag. Guanxi
möjliggör för företaget att minska transaktionskostnader eller öka transaktionsvärden, genom
enklare utbyte av resurser, kunskap och information. Det kan ses som en form av relationsutbyte,
som återspeglar grundidén i nätverkskapitalism. Det baserar på förtroende och växelverkan som
erbjuder värde genom effektiv användning av socialt kapital. Det kännetecknas av informella
förbindelser, som påverkas av hierarkiska kinesiska kulturvärden, som är knutna till ömsesidiga
förväntningar. De är särskilt fördelaktiga för utländska företag, på grund av att de erbjuder en
konkurrensfördel genom att minska marknadsosäkerhet och opportunistiskt beteende (Buckley et al,
2006). Internationella fallskärmsmodellen grundar sig på GLOCAL, som är en kombination av
80

Jens Tuovinen

orden global och lokal. Inom strategin finns en engelsk akronym, som är metoden som möjliggör
företagets tillträde in på en ny marknad. Översatt står akronymen för global vision, position,
möjlighet, kapital och andra resurser som stöder globaliseringen, accelererat kulturellt lärande och
snabb handling samt logistikförberedelse och noggrann planering.

7.2

Syfte och forskningsfrågor

Finland är globalt känt för sina innovativa teknologiföretag. Tidigare har dock en stor del av
företagen haft utmaningar att expandera, fastän produkten eller tjänsten varit lönsam. Att komma in
på nya marknader är västenligt för företag som är aktiva inom en nisch enbart för att överleva, på
grund av den inhemska marknadens storlek som ofta är bristfällig. Finland har expertis inom
cleantech, och Kina har en växande efterfrågan för dessa produkter. På grund av globaliseringen
måste dock företagen vara snabba på att nå nya marknader, innan konkurrenterna hinner få fotfäste
där. Dessutom har affärsnätverket som företaget lyckats skapa en central roll inom
internationaliseringen. Det är väsentligt att skapa relationer med kinesiska aktörer på grund av att
Kina är en tillväxtmarknad vars affärsomgivning skiljer sig starkt från den inhemska kulturen.
Denna avhandling bygger på hur och till vilken grad finska företag har lyckats implementera
Internationella fallskärmsmodellen när de har expanderat till den kinesiska marknaden. Resultaten
kan därmed jämföras med den ursprungliga forskningen, och det kan tolkas om nordiska länder i
allmänhet har använt fallskärmsmodellen på ett liknanden sätt, eller om finska företag har använt
modellen i mindre utsträckning eller på ett annat sätt.
För att uppnå det huvudsakliga syftet med denna avhandling har nedanstående forskningsfrågor
formulerats:
1. Hur har Internationella fallskärmsmodellen presenterats som ett sätt för ett företag att
expandera till nya marknader?
2. Hur implementerade finska företag en GLOCAL-strategi för att genomföra Internationella
fallskärmsmodellen på den kinesiska marknaden?
3. Vilka egenskaper bör beaktas, när ett företag väljer sin strategi för att komma in på den
kinesiska marknaden?
4. Vilka är konsekvenserna av företagens affärsnätverk för att genomföra
fallskärmsinternationaliseringen?

7.3

Metodik

Den empiriska forskningen genomfördes som en kvalitativ studie, genom djupintervjuer.
Personerna som intervjuades är antingen grundare eller har ledande positioner i företagen.
Anledningen till detta tillvägagångssätt var att möjliggöra så grundliga och personliga beskrivningar
som möjligt av hur företagsledare har fattat sina beslut om internationaliseringsprocessen. På grund
av coronapandemin genomfördes intervjuerna på Microsoft Teams, Zoom samt per telefon.
Intervjuerna genomfördes mellan 3.11.2020 och 8.2.2021. Fallföretagen som valdes till forskningen
är grundade i Finland och är aktiva inom cleantech-branschen. De skiljer sig till storlek, längden på
deras existens på marknaden, och till produkterna eller tjänsterna som produceras. Företag med
olika egenskaper valdes för att få mer mångfaldiga resultat, och för att kunna jämföra hur de hade

Resultat och diskussion

Resultaten från forskningen visar att en uppdaterad internationaliseringsmodell som
fallskärmsmetoden behövs i dagens globala marknadsmiljö, som snabbt förändras. Den senaste
negativa händelsen som plötsligt skett, är coronaviruset som har tvingat företagen att anpassa sig till
de ändrade marknadsförhållandena.
Vissa aspekter från den ursprungliga Uppsala Internationaliseringsmodell främst att erhålla
marknadskunskap, är fortfarande viktigt för de flesta företagen idag. För undersökningens
fallföretag hade Finlands bristfälliga marknadsstorlek varit den främsta orsaken till
internationalisering. Detta har egenskaper av Born Global-modellen, där företaget från första början
har beslutat att expandera globalt.
Alla intervjuade personer noterade egenskaper som kan anses härstamma från Guanxi hos kinesiska
affärsaktörer. Detta gör fallskärmsstrategin lönsam, eftersom den ser kultur ur ett yin- och
yangperspektiv, där gamla och nya kulturella värden samexisterar. Guanxi, det informella sociala
82

Jens Tuovinen

nätverket, är ett gammalt kulturellt värde, medan Kinas ökade kapitalism och växande medelklass
kan ses som en ny utveckling. Flera av personerna som intervjuades för undersökningen hade haft
svårigheter med att skapa förtroende hos kinesiska aktörer. Detta berodde på att det vanligtvis
krävde mycket engagemang och tid att skapa trovärdighet. Därmed lades en stor vikt på att hålla
informella möten innan förhandlingar, för att möjliggöra att lära känna varandra och skapa en
djupare relation. En annan utmaning var den hierarkiska strukturen och motvilligheten hos den
kinesiska parten att i början av relationen dela tilläggsinformation som kunde vara användbar. Det
betonades dock att de kinesiska aktörerna var lojala och öppna efter att förtroende hade skapats. En
stor del av fallföretagen hade etablerat djupa relationer med lokala aktörer. Dessa relationer hade
varit väsentliga i företagets internationaliseringsprocess. Kina är en marknad där den lokala
regeringen fritt kan tillämpa fördelaktiga policyer för affärsaktörer. Därför bör det
internationaliserande företaget sträva efter att hålla nära band med lagstiftande beslutsfattare.
Glaston Corporation hade lyckats hålla en gynnsam relation med lokala beslutsfattare när de byggde
och drev sin fabrik i Tianjin. Detta hade underlättat deras affärsverksamhet på marknaden.
Resultaten stämde med tidigare internationaliseringslitteratur, som lägger vikt på det existerade
nätverket från hemmamarknaden för ett internationaliserande företag. I undersökningen kunde detta
analyseras på olika sätt. Till exempel Roboride Ltd hade lyckats få sin första kund på den kinesiska
marknaden genom en rekommendation från ett finskt företag som redan var aktivt på marknaden.
Wetend Technologies första kund på den kinesiska marknaden var ett finskt företag som
verkställande direktören hade en god relation från tidigare med. Förutom detta etablerade företaget
också en strategisk allians med ett annat finländskt företag i Kina som båda partnerna gynnas av.
Alla fallföretagen hade implementerat Internationella fallskärmsmodellen. Företagen hade i
varierande grad använt en kombination av Uppsala Internationaliseringsmodell och Born Globalmodellen. Företag som hade kommit in på marknaden på 90-talet, innan Internet-boomen hade mer
aspekter av Uppsala Internationaliseringsmodell. Detta kunde tolkas genom att de hade samlat
marknadskunskap och stegvis ökat sina resurser. Till exempel Glaston Corporation hade först
använt sig av försäljningsagenter och gradvis byggt upp en egen fabrik. Roboride Ltd har haft
mycket inslag av Born Global-modellen genom att de snabbt internationaliserat sig på den kinesiska
marknaden och använt relationer med lokala kontakter och resurserna som de erbjudit.
Fallföretagen hade skapat relationer med olika slags affärsaktörer. Dessa aktörer, som varierade
starkt beroende på företaget, hade spelat en väsentlig roll i internationaliseringen och i att få fotfäste
på marknaden.. Därmed kan internationella fallskärmsinternationaliseringen implementeras med
diverse affärsrelationer. Ofta hade aktörerna erbjudit användbara kontakter eller diverse kunskaper
83

Jens Tuovinen

om marknaden. Flera av personerna som intervjuades förklarade att företagets goda rykte hade
möjliggjort att få kunder på den nya marknaden. Flera av fallföretagen deltog också på mässor och
skapade kontakter där som de hade utnyttjat vid internationaliseringen till Kina. Framförallt för
Cross Wrap Oy var mässor i en central roll för internationaliseringsprocessen.
Företagets produkt eller tjänst hade också haft en stor betydelse för internationaliseringen i Kina.
Om företaget hade specialiserat sig på komponenter hade det varit väsentligt att hitta lämpliga
distributörer, medan företag som samarbetade nära med sina kunder fungerade självständigare på
marknaden. För dessa företag var det väsentligt att samla marknadskunskap samt relationer med
lokala aktörer som hade expertis om marknaden. Fallföretagen föredrog också att använda sig av
lokala försäljningsanställda. Detta möjliggjorde att justera företagets produkt eller tjänst för den
lokala marknaden. Denna aspekt är väsentlig i fallskärmsmodellen, där företaget måste vara
kapabelt att anpassa sig till olika kulturer.
På grund av pandemin hade alla fallföretagen ökat sin användning av webbkonferensprogram.
Företagen måste vara snabba på att konstant anpassa sig till ändringar på den globala marknaden.
Detta betonas i Internationella fallskärmsmodellen, som är en kombination av globalt och lokalt
verkställande. Modellen är lämplig, eftersom den beaktar behovet att planera för oväntade
marknadsförändringar och att snabbt kunna anpassa sig till dem. Teknologin utvecklas i snabb takt
och företagen måste vara kapabla att använda diverse program när en oförväntad kris uppstår. De
digitala konferensprogrammen har möjliggjort för organisationer att kommunicera med team som är
globalt spridda att arbeta så effektivt och snabbt som möjligt. Personerna som intervjuades för
undersökningen förklarade att digitala konferensprogrammen hade varit otroligt väsentliga vid
resebegränsningarna. Fallföretagen som hade lokala anställda som var verksamma på kinesiska
marknaden hade inte påverkats lika hårt av pandemin på grund av att de kunde fortsätta med
affärsverksamheten.
Av fallföretagen representerar Roboride Ltd väl Internationella fallskärmsmodellen. Företaget
expanderade till Kina redan ett år efter att det hade grundats. Deltagare 4, verkställande direktören,
förklarade att företaget som verkade som en autonom transportoperatör, vilket är en ”megatrend”,
måste som global marknadsledare snabbt få fotfäste på Kinas marknad och skapa goda relationer
med olika lokala aktörer. Dessa relationer kan erbjuda användbara resurser och marknadskunskap.
”Megatrender” är kopplade till Internationella fallskärmsmodellen på grund av att de sprids globalt.
Undersökningen visar att finska företag lika framgångsrikt som svenska och danska företag kan
genomföra Internationella fallskärmsmodellen för att komma in på den kinesiska marknaden.

Begränsningar och förslag för framtida forskning

Denna studie begränsas av det låga antalet fallföretag. Några av fallföretagen hade
internationaliserat sig i Kina redan i början av 90-talet. Då hade globalisering redan skett men inte
uppgången av internetanvändandet, vilket var främsta orsaken att Internationella
fallskärmsmodellen grundades, på grund av den ökade informationsspridningen som internet
möjliggjorde. Dessa företag visade en mer riskavvikande och gradvis expansion, kännetecknad av
Uppsala internationaliseringsmodell. Dessutom har endast finska chefer intervjuats i studien.
Därmed är de kinesiska aktörernas åsikter och syn på affärsrelationerna inte representerade i denna
forskning. För framtida forskning skulle det vara intressant att se resultaten från en motsatt
forskning, genom att analysera kinesiska aktörers åsikter om expansionen till den finska marknaden.
