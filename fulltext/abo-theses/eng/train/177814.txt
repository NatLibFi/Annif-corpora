ABSTRACT
The main purpose of this work was to comprehend and promulgate the process of predicting
the kinematic viscosity of liquid hydrocarbon mixtures using empirical correlations and
mixing rules. The performance of the most promising empirical correlations, describing the
temperature dependence of the kinematic viscosity of liquid hydrocarbon mixtures, as well
as mixing rules, describing the outcome of combining two fluids differing in kinematic
viscosity, are evaluated by comparative means against a diverse experimental dataset
attained exclusively for this work. The evaluated methods were chosen based on recognition
and potentiality expressed in previous publications. A total of five empirical correlations, six
mixing rules, and recent amended versions (where applicable) were investigated. The general
results indicate that the most accurate and universal method of both types were found.

Keywords: Liquid viscosity, kinematic viscosity, hydrocarbons, empirical estimation, mixing

POPULÄRVETENSKAPLIG SAMMANFATTNING
Viskositeten hos en vätska utsäger hur “tjock” eller “tunn” en vätska är. En vätska som till
exempel vatten har en låg viskositet och är mycket tunn, medan till exempel honung har en
betydligt högre viskositet och är mycket tjockare. Viskositeten är en av de viktigaste
egenskaperna hos kolvätevätskor (bränslen, smörjmedel, oljor osv.). En för hög eller för låg
viskositet kan orsaka katastrofala problem i de flesta tillämpningarna. Standardiserade
gränser för hur låg eller hög viskositeten hos produkter som består av kolvätevätskor får vara
har fastställts på grund av detta. Gränserna är oftast temperaturbundna, dvs. en viss
viskositet skall uppnås vid en viss temperatur. Viskositeten hos produkterna kan variera
avsevärt, eftersom oljeraffinaderier är mycket komplicerade och allt fler nya råvaror tas i
bruk tack vare den ökande klimatmedvetenheten. Det skulle därmed vara mycket nyttigt att
kunna estimera viskositeten hos kolvätevätskor vid olika temperaturer på basen av till
exempel andra fysikalisk-kemiska egenskaper. I denna pro gradu-avhandling undersöktes
flera olika metoder som kan lösa detta problem. Det visade sig att det bästa sättet för att
estimera viskositeten för en kolvätevätska vid en okänd temperatur var att använda kända
värden för viskositet vid en eller två temperaturer. Med andra ord betyder detta att kända
viskositetsvärden används för att bestämma viskositeten vid ytterligare temperaturer.
Alternativt kan temperaturen då 50 volymprocent av ett prov har destillerats och i vissa fall
densiteten vid 15 °C användas. Alla metoder som hittades visade sig vara mycket noggranna
för proven som undersöktes. Estimering av viskositeten då två vätskor av känd konsistens
blandas ihop undersöktes också. Två mycket exakta metoder för estimeringen av de
resulterande blandningarnas viskositet hittades.

INTRODUCTION

Traditional oil refineries are enormous facilities where crude oil is separated into different
fractions and then processed to give a plethora of products. The most characteristic part of
a traditional oil refinery is, among other process units, the primary atmospheric distillation
tower (i.e. the topping unit). Here, the crude oil is distilled, giving different fractions, which
are then processed further to produce various oil-based products. Traditional products of oil
refining can be categorized into four different classes based on the targeted use. These
include: 1) Industrial and domestic fuels (gas oils, fuel oils, or LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas));
2) Motor fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG); 3) Feedstocks for various chemical industries
(virgin naphtha, LPG, olefins); and 4) Other products (e.g. lubricating oils, bitumens, paraffins,
and solvents).1 A simplified view of the various products produced in a traditional oil refinery
is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Simplified view of the products of a traditionally run refinery. Reproduced from: D. Y. Murzin,
Chemical Reaction Technology; Walter de Gruyter GmbH: Turku, Finland, 2015, p.116 (see ref. 1.).

The chemically similar components of crude oil (hydrocarbons) are separated by distillation,
as mentioned above. In distillation, separation occurs due to the differences in boiling points
of the constituents of the mixture being distilled. The boiling points of the individual
components are, on the other hand, related to the number of carbon atoms in the molecules
(i.e. the size of the molecule). Fractions owning a higher boiling point (larger molecules) are

___________________________________________________________________________
thus recovered at the lower parts of the distillation unit, while fractions with lower boiling
points (smaller molecules) are recovered at higher sections of the distillation tower. A more
detailed illustration of the atmospheric distillation unit, showing the approximate side
stream draw-offs (side cuts) is depicted in Figure 2. Notice that some of the side streams are
returned as reflux.1

Murzin, Chemical Reaction Technology; Walter de Gruyter GmbH: Turku, Finland, 2015, p.117 (see ref. 1.).

Various parameters such as reflux rate and temperature profile can be adjusted at this stage
of the process to affect the properties of the side streams.1 Further processing of the side
streams introduces multiple parameters which may be altered to affect the properties of the
final product. Examples of boiling point ranges and carbon number ranges of various oil
fractions are given in Table 1.

The complexity of a refinery ensures that two refineries with the same refining scheme are
very unlikely to exist. Process schemes of refineries are usually designed based on market
demand and crude oil characteristics. A general example of an oil refinery scheme including
various process units for the reaction and workup of side streams, as well as the resulting
products is shown in Figure 3.1

Middle distillates (e.g. diesel fuel, aviation fuel, and heating oil) are commonly among the
main products of a traditionally run refinery. The complexity of a refinery results in a very
wide range of grades within each product group. Most of the products produced in a refinery
are specification products, meaning that the physicochemical properties of the products
must meet certain limits.1 The estimation of the final physicochemical properties of products
has therefore always been important for the petroleum industry. The recent and future
introduction of alternative fuel feedstocks and production methods due to the rising
awareness of global warming has introduced added complexity to the estimation of key
properties of the products.2 Key properties of liquid hydrocarbons of the middle to heavy
distillate range are, among others, the density, cloud point, freezing point, pour point, cetane
number, and viscosity of the products.2–4
Viscosity is one of the most important properties of liquid hydrocarbon products.3,4 A precise
theory expressing the viscosity of liquid fluids has not been found, despite a century of
theoretical research, due to the complexity of the involved liquid momentum transfer
mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on the viscosity of liquids is
characterized by a non-linear relationship. Simple methods for the accurate prediction of
liquid viscosity do not exist and the introduction of alternative feedstocks introduces new
aspects to consider.2,5,6 All the aforementioned arguments served as motivation for this
thesis.

BACKGROUND

Recent increase in the production of heavy and extra-heavy crude oils has accentuated the
importance of estimating physical and chemical properties, such as viscosity and density.
These parameters are of utmost importance in for instance the pipeline transportation of
oils.7 One of the main properties of interest in the field of base oils and lubricants has always
been the viscosity, since the main function of the lubricants in a mechanical system is the
control of friction and wear. Change in the viscosity of oil is well known to result from changes
in temperature, pressure, and shear rate. The film-forming properties of oil are also known
to be proportional to these dimensions. Lubricant viscosity is extremely sensitive to
temperature change, which is why the temperature dependence of viscosity is of major
concern for the lubricant industry.8 Efforts concerning the optimization of direct-injection
diesel engines is primarily focused on the improved atomization of the fuel when sprayed
into the combustion chamber. This is usually achieved by an increase in injection pressure,
whereas the size of the droplets formed within the injectors is governed by fuel viscosity
through a mechanism called droplet breakup. Higher viscosity translates to larger droplets as
well as additional strain on all mechanical parts of the fuel system. Droplet size is, in addition,
directly related to the emission characteristics of an engine, since smaller droplets favor
vaporization and more complete combustion. Herein, a balance between emissions and
viscosity of the fuel is found, which clearly describes the importance of accurate prediction
of hydrocarbon viscosity.4 Aircraft fuel tanks can reach extremely low temperatures at high
altitudes. A crucial characteristic of jet fuel is therefore the low-temperature fluidity of the
fuel. Low-temperature fluidity of aviation fuel can be characterized by two intrinsic features:
freezing point, and kinematic viscosity. These must be sufficiently low, ensuring proper fuel
fluidity in the turbine engine systems of aircraft.9
Viscosities of fuels may be specified to fall within a maximum limit, minimum limit or even
both, in standard specifications. Fuel viscosities exceeding specification limits may lead to
issues related to emission characteristics (excessive droplet size), fuel pumpability and even
filter plugging.3 On the other hand, viscosities significantly below the specification limit range
may indirectly cause issues related to decreased lubricity, which may cause wear in the fuel
system components by reduced film-forming properties. In fact, this is applicable for all cases
mentioned above, including those cases where the specification does not specify a minimum
limit for viscosity.8,9 However, desulfurization of fuels has complicated this mechanism and

5

Wolter Rautelin

___________________________________________________________________________
an increased viscosity may not therefore provide increased lubricity in all cases. See Section
2.3 for more information about liquid hydrocarbon specifications.

2.1

Viscosity of liquids

Viscosity is an intrinsic property of all fluids. A flowing fluid has an internal resistance to flow.
Hence, the viscosity of a fluid is the measure of this resistance to flow (or shear). Viscosity is
a function of both temperature and pressure. The viscosity of liquids and gases are affected
differently by changes in temperature and pressure. The temperature dependence of liquid
viscosity (including liquid hydrocarbons) is fully characterized by the structure of the
individual molecules.10
The theories of fluid viscosity related to gases are very well developed in comparison to those
of liquids. Momentum transfer between molecules results in the viscosity of a certain
medium. The molecules within gaseous substances are separated by vast distances in
comparison to the molecules in liquids. Momentum transfer occurring within gaseous
substances is therefore governed by much simpler forces than the corresponding forces
acting on momentum transfer within liquids, due to the proximity of the molecules within
the liquids. Several theories have been formulated for the viscosity of gases, including
accurate methods for viscosity prediction and temperature dependency. 5 Nevertheless, the
subject of the viscosities of gaseous fluids is out of the scope of the present work. Thus, only
Newtonian liquids (i.e. liquids in which the viscosity remains constant while the amount of
applied shear stress is varied) will be discussed in this thesis.
The viscosity of liquids may be expressed in two different forms: 1) Absolute or dynamic
viscosity and 2) Kinematic viscosity.5 The two types are described in Section 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.
2.1.1

Dynamic viscosity

The dynamic viscosity is described as “the tangential force per unit area required to slide one
layer (A) against another layer (B) when the two layers are maintained at a unit distance”. 5
The system is depicted in Figure 4 where the force F causes layers A and B to slide at velocities
v1 and v2, respectively.5 The viscosity of a fluid can be described mathematically as shown in
equation (1).
𝜎= 𝜂

𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑥

(1)

where σ is the shear stress, η represents the dynamic viscosity and 𝑑𝑣/𝑑𝑥 is the shear rate.

Y. Rani Viscosity of Liquids; Springer Netherlands: Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 2007, p.2 (see ref. 5.).

The dynamic viscosity may therefore be written in the form of equation (2).
𝑥

𝜂 = 𝜎𝑣

(2)

where σ represents as the shear stress that is enacted when layer A moves in relation to layer
B, x is the length that A moved in relation to B and v is the velocity at which that occurred.
Converting kinematic viscosity to dynamic viscosity:
The dynamic viscosity of a sample at the measured temperature can be calculated by
multiplying the kinematic viscosity result with the density (ρ) of the sample, provided that
both are known at the same temperature.11 The most common units of dynamic viscosity are
Pascal-seconds (Pa∙s or kg/m∙s), Poise (P, g/cm∙s), and Centipoise (cP, 1/100 Poise).5
2.1.2

Kinematic viscosity

The kinematic viscosity of a sample can be obtained by dividing the dynamic viscosity (η) with
the density (ρ) of the sample, provided that both have been determined at the same
temperature.12 The most common units for kinematic viscosity are m2/s, Stokes (St, cm2/s),
and Centistokes (cSt, mm2/s).5
The laboratory test method used in this thesis (see Section 5.3.1) provides only the kinematic
viscosity of a sample (density is not provided). All the empirical correlations and mixing rules
described in Section 4 either require or provide the kinematic viscosity of a sample. All
further mentioning of viscosity in this work therefore specifically implies kinematic viscosity
unless otherwise specified.

2.2

Hydrocarbon types and their influence on the physicochemical properties of
fuel

Liquid hydrocarbon mixtures in the middle distillate range are primarily composed of nparaffins (i.e. normal paraffins), i-paraffins (i.e. isoparaffins), olefins (i.e. unsaturated
paraffins), cyclic paraffins, and aromatics. Each of the molecular group types supply specific
properties to the products. Some of the most important properties provided by each group
type, to middle distillate fuels, are listed below.13,14 The cold flow properties of middle
distillate fuels are very important. The impact on these properties are therefore mentioned
several times in the list provided below.
•

Normal paraffins
o

Increased energy content and decreased cold flow properties. Positive
impact on the cetane number of the fuel.

•

Isoparaffins
o

Shape irregularity and branching provides improved cold flow properties
compared to n-paraffin counterparts. Influences the resulting cetane
number of the fuel negatively.

•

Olefins
o

Good combustion characteristics, however, undesirable in fuels due to poor
gum stability.

•

Cycloparaffins
o

Improved cold flow properties and higher density than n- and i-paraffin
counterparts of the same carbon number.

•

Alkylbenzenes (substituted single-ring aromatics)
o

Provide increased energy density per unit volume as well as elastomer
swelling, both crucial for fuel system integrity.

•

Naphthalenes, alkylnaphthalenes, tetralins and indans
o

These multi-ring aromatics cause adverse effects on combustion through
contribution to soot formation.

Every hydrocarbon class holds anywhere from tens to hundreds of individual chemical
compounds. Each of the compounds contributes to the properties of a sample. The sum of
these, result in the final properties of a sample, which can be measured by routine laboratory
procedures.13 Complete analyses of middle distillates, involving the identification of the 1000

8

Wolter Rautelin

___________________________________________________________________________
or more components in a sample, are possible by the use of complex and time consuming
spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. Tracing the effect that each individual
compound has on the physicochemical properties of a sample is, however, considered
impractical, since the hydrocarbon component classes (e.g. n-paraffins) have been found to
impart certain chemical and physical properties as groups. Researchers have therefore
resorted to various “group-type” separations when working with petroleum-based products.
Identification and quantification of these group-types can be achieved by spectroscopic
methods like GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and GCxGC (two-dimensional
gas chromatography).10,13

2.3

Typical standards governing the quality of fuels and oil products

Standards regulate the quality of fuels and oils by specifying limits for specific physical and
chemical properties of the substances. Multiple standards for each product class are
available since countries and/or continents are governed by local institutions, supplying their
own standards for the products. Some of the largest standardization organizations in the
world include ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Materials), API
(American Petroleum Institute), CEN (Comité Européen De Normalisation), and ISO
(International Organization for Standardization). Organizations governing the use of fuels in
specific cases, exist as well. The United States military (MIL standards) for example, governs
the quality of fuels for military use in the USA. Additionally, standards by organizations such
as the British Ministry of Defense (DEFSTAN standards) include specifications for fuels
intended for civil, commercial, and military use Heavily standardized industries, such as the
aviation industry, follow additional standards of organizations such as the Joint Inspection
Group (JIG), whose main concern is the aviation fuel supply chain (i.e. refinery to aircraft).
The standards published by ASTM International, CEN, and ISO were of interest in this work.
The standards regulating the quality of the products relevant to this work, including
tabulated viscosity limits for each product group, are described in this section.
2.3.1

Aviation turbine fuels

One of the main governing organizations for the quality of aviation fuel is ASTM International.
Fossil aviation fuels are regulated by the “ASTM D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation
Turbine Fuels”. This standard originally dictated the specification limits for “aviation fuel
consisting predominantly of refined hydrocarbons derived from fossil raw materials”. Today,
products originating from renewable raw materials must satisfy these limits as well. The fuels

9

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
grades included are Jet A and Jet A-1.14 Aviation fuels consisting of both fossil and synthetic
blending components are additionally governed by the “ASTM D7566 Standard Specification
for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons”. Specifications limits for the
properties of currently approved synthetic blending components are defined in the annexes
of the standard. The final fuel blends, however, have to satisfy the requirements of both
D7566 and D1655, if synthetic components are present (as indicated above).15 Other
commercial and military grade aviation fuels are governed by for example standards
DEFSTAN 91-91, DEFSTAN 91-87, and MIL-DTL-83133 issued by the Ministry of Defense of the
United Kingdom and the United States Airforce, respectively. The fuel grades included in
these specifications are JP-8 and Jet A-1.16–18 Multiple additional aviation fuel specifications
by various military and government organizations exist as well.19 Detailed descriptions of
these can be found elsewhere in the literature. The viscosity limits of the mentioned
specifications are given in Table 2.

2.3.2

Diesel fuels

Diesel fuels can be divided into two main groups based on use. Automotive diesel fuel or onroad diesel is a group of fuels which have been developed to be suitable for automotive use.
Non-road diesel (i.e. red diesel, due to colorant) is a group of fuels which are intended to be
used in applications excluding automotive use. In some countries, a colorant is added to nonroad diesel to dissociate the two fuel types due to fiscal policies. Certain performance
additives, beneficial for the automotive use of the fuels, may not have been added to nonroad diesel.

(Comité Européen De Normalisation, CEN) in Europe. EN 590 is the standard for fossil

from synthesis or hydrotreatment. Both standards include generally acceptable limits as well
as climate-related requirements. The climate related requirements are divided into classes 0,
1, 2, 3, and 4 in both standards. The classification is governed by the cetane number of the
fuel in all cases. The generally acceptable requirements of EN 15940 are further divided into
classes A and B due to the acceptance of cycloparaffins in class B (this decreases the cetane
number of the resulting fuel). The viscosity requirements of classes A and B do not differ.20,21
The viscosity requirements of both standards are listed in Table 3.

Heating oil

A common European standard for the quality of heating oil and non-road diesel does not
exist. The sulfur content of the fuels is capped by the Sulphur Content of Liquid Fuels Directive.
All other properties of the fuels are governed by country-specific standards, the EN 590
standard for automotive diesel fuel or no standard at all, depending on the country.23
The quality of heating oil and non-road diesel is governed by the “ASTM D0396 Standard
Specification for Fuel Oils” in the USA. The fuels are divided into six grades of which No. 4
and 5 are further divided into “light” and/or “heavy” grades. 24 The specified viscosity limits
of the grades are listed in Table 5.

One of the most relevant properties for the classification and marketing of base oils is the
viscosity of the products. The API 1509 (API Engine Oil Licensing and Certification System,
EOLCS) categorizes base oils into groups I, II, III, IV, and V based on refining method, viscosity,
saturate content, and sulfur content.26 The viscosity index (see Section 2.4.2) limits for these
groups are listed in Table 7.

Selected standard laboratory test methods for the determination of liquid
viscosity

The viscosity (dynamic or kinematic) of hydrocarbon samples may be determined by multiple
standardized methods. Results presented in the literature may have been determined by any
of these techniques. A selection of important standardized test methods for viscosity
determination are presented in this section.
2.4.1

ASTM D445

The “ASTM D445 Standard Test Method for Kinematic Viscosity of Transparent and Opaque
Liquids” describes the standard procedure for determining the kinematic viscosity (v) of a
transparent or opaque sample of liquid petroleum.11 This method was used for all viscosity
measurements presented in this thesis due to its widespread use, broad temperature range,
and capability of processing multiple samples simultaneously. Furthermore, the method is
generally accepted by most standards. A sketch of a Cannon-Fenske Routine viscometer used
in this method is provided in Figure 5. The standard test method is discussed in more detail
in the experimental section (see Section 5.3.1).

ASTM D2270

The “ASTM D2270 Standard Practice for Calculating Viscosity Index from Kinematic Viscosity
at 40 °C and 100 °C” comprises the standard for calculating the viscosity index of a sample,
given that the kinematic viscosity data of the sample is known at 40 °C and 100 °C. The
viscosity index (VI) is a generally accepted measure of temperature dependence of the
viscosity of a sample. The VI of a sample is in practice a single number which indicates the
temperature dependence of the kinematic viscosity of the sample. The higher the viscosity
index, the lower the decrease in viscosity of the sample with increasing temperature.27
2.4.3

ASTM D7042

The “ASTM D7042 Standard Test Method for Dynamic Viscosity and Density of Liquids by
Stabinger Viscometer (and the Calculation of Kinematic Viscosity)” describes the procedure
for measuring both the dynamic viscosity (η) and the density of a liquid petroleum product
or crude oil (provided that the sample is transparent and opaque) simultaneously using the
Stabinger Viscometer. The precision of the method has only been determined for the
materials, viscosities, densities, and temperatures indicated in the specification. 12
The Stabinger Viscometer is a modified Couette-type coaxial rotational cylinder viscometer.
A general illustration of a coaxial cylinder viscometer is given in Figure 6.5

ASTM D7945

The “ASTM D7945 Standard Test Method for Determination of Dynamic Viscosity and Derived
Kinematic Viscosity of Liquids by Constant Pressure Viscometer” comprises the procedure for
the determination of the dynamic viscosity and the density of a sample. These are
determined for the purpose of deriving the kinematic viscosity of the sample based on the
results. The dynamic viscosity and density are obtained by an automated apparatus. The
kinematic viscosity is determined, based on these results, by the calculative procedure
described in Section 2.1.2. The method also describes how the standard practice ASTM D341
(see Section 4.1.1) can be used for calculating the temperature at which a petroleum product
attains a certain kinematic viscosity. The constant pressure viscometer is a capillary flow
viscometer that uses the Hagen-Poiseuille principle of capillary flow to determine the
viscosity of a sample (the time it takes for a specific volume of liquid to pass through a
capillary is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid). 5 It differs however from traditional
viscometers in that, even though a capillary is used to restrict the flow of fluid and provide
the means by which the viscosity of the sample is determined, a constant pressure of
compressed air is used as the driving force for the fluid instead of gravity. 28
The unnecessary complexity and time-consuming task of measuring each sample separately,
the introduction of an additional source of error by automation, and the mathematically
derived kinematic viscosity were the grounds for not following this procedure in this work.
2.4.5

ASTM D5293

The “ASTM D5293 Standard Test Method for Apparent Viscosity of Engine Oils and Base
Stocks Between -10 °C and -35 °C Using Cold-Cranking Simulator” encompasses a specialized
approach for assessing the effects of the low temperature viscosity of oils on the
performance in conditions simulating a real-life use case. The Cold-Cranking Simulator (CCS)
result correlates with the cranking of an engine at low temperature and is known as the
Apparent Cranking Viscosity. This approach produces results purely from a usability
standpoint and should not be used for the prediction of low temperature flow in an engine.
Information such as the determination of base stock suitability for engine oil formulations is
gathered using this method. The method is calibrated using calibration oils that could be used
for the formulation of an engine oil.29 A picture of a Cold-Cranking Simulator is provided in
Figure 7.

AIM OF THIS WORK

The viscosity of liquids is, among other things, a non-linear property with regards to
temperature. This simple fact, arising from the complex molecular interactions involved in
the seemingly straightforward physicochemical property of viscosity, complicates the
predictive analytics involved in the estimation of the temperature dependence of liquid
viscosity. Empirical correlations and mixing rules are still to this date one of the few feasible
methods available for the prediction of liquid hydrocarbon mixture viscosities. Several
empirical correlations and mixing rules are available in the literature, improved approaches
have been proposed since the early 20th century. Several reviews regarding the most
common “classical” methods as well as revisions of the methods are also available. Most of
the aforementioned efforts have been aimed toward the estimation of the viscosities of
liquid hydrocarbons derived from traditional fossil feedstocks. In fact, most of the methods
described in this work have originally been developed for the estimation of crude oil
viscosities. The suitability of these methods for the prediction of the viscosity of liquid
hydrocarbon mixtures arising from the continuously growing alternative feedstock pool has
not been evaluated in detail. The aim of this work is therefore to arrive at the best methods
for the prediction of liquid hydrocarbon mixture viscosities of a diverse component pool
including the blends thereof.

PREDICTION OF THE VISCOSITY OF COMPLEX HYDROCARBON
MIXTURES

Several research groups have attempted to capture the intrinsic nature of liquid viscosity
using various theories. Multiple mechanistic models have been proposed to describe the
correlation of liquid viscosity, temperature, and pressure. The models most representative
of this relationship are the Friction Theory and the Expand Fluid Theory. Multiple models
exist that consider both the temperature and pressure when calculating the viscosities of
liquids. The viscosity prediction model developed by Quiñones-Cisneros et al.30 calculates the
viscosity of pure compounds, such as individual n-alkanes, based on the Friction Theory and
the van der Waals Theory at low to high pressures. The development of a three-singleparameter model based on the Friction Theory and the Cubic Equations of State, by the same
group, expanded the application of the model to light, medium, and heavy oil systems.31–33
Yarranton et al.34 developed a three-parameter correlation capable of calculating the
viscosities of hydrocarbons, heavy oils, and heavy oil mixtures based on the expand fluid
theory. Motahhari et al.35 and Ramos-Pallares et al.36 implemented the Expand Fluid Theory
on mixtures of compounds as well as petroleum systems using binary interaction parameters.
The mechanistic models described in the works by Quiñones-Cisneros et al.., Yarranton et al.,
Motahhari et al., and Ramos-Pallares et al. are capable of predicting the variation of fluid
viscosity at high pressures and high temperatures with relatively low deviation. These models
are therefore of great importance, for example, in the field of oil and gas reservoirs.
Mechanistic models of this type, however, often contain an excessive number of parameters
that require determination by regression, thus introducing an overwhelming complexity to
the calculations.10
The liquid of interest in most chemical engineering processes, including the samples tested
in this thesis, are under a medium- to low-pressure environment. The impact of the pressure
on the viscosity of the liquid is negligible under these conditions and can therefore be
excluded from the calculations. Variation in the viscosity of a hydrocarbon mixture can
consequently be considered to occur only due to changes in temperature. The viscositytemperature relationship of hydrocarbon mixtures can be described by a variety of empirical
equations.10 These empirical correlations are usually much simpler than the mechanistic
models, only containing a couple of basic parameters and one or more experimentally
determined values, based on which the viscosity can be extrapolated to a different

temperature. The most common experimentally determined property used for this is the
viscosity of a sample at a single temperature. Other common properties are for example the
weighted average boiling point temperature and the specific gravity of a sample. 37
Most empirical correlations available in the literature are based on the equations developed
by Vogel38, Walther39, or Andrade40. A clear trend toward the use of the Walther correlation
can, however, be distinguished. This can be explained by the simple fact that the approaches
based on the Walther correlation exhibit much lower average absolute deviations (AAD)
compared to the Vogel and Andrade counterparts.37 The most promising correlations found
in the literature are discussed in this section.
The equations evaluated in this work were chosen based on recommendations as well as
performance presented in the literature and are therefore mostly concentrated on iterations
of the Walther correlation. The performance of the most promising equations of this section
were evaluated using the experimental data gathered in the experimental section of this
work. The results can be found in Section 6.2.

Walther correlation

The Walther equation provides the foundation of the ASTM D341 standard. The ASTM D341
Standard Practice for Viscosity-Temperature Charts for Liquid Petroleum Products is a
method for assessing the effect of temperature on the viscosity of various petroleum
products. The method is based on conventional viscosity-temperature charts. These charts
have traditionally been used for the approximation of the viscosity of a fuel or oil sample, at
any temperature, provided that the viscosity of the sample is known at two separate
temperatures. The two known data points are marked on the chart and a line connecting
both is drawn. The viscosity at any other temperature can be established within the limits of
the chart by the plotted line. Multiple charts with different scales are available.45
The charts given in the standard have also been used for the approximation of liquid
viscosities of blends of components. This requires manual plotting of the viscositytemperature lines of each component on the chart and blending of the components by linear
proportioning at constant viscosity or temperature (the horizontal or vertical distance is
measured). The manual method is time consuming and the obtained results are known to be
inaccurate.7 See Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.5 for detailed information regarding the calculation
approach to these methods and how the inaccuracy can be reduced.
The charts themselves are simplified practical tools that are governed by an equation. The
underlying equation is therefore of greater interest regarding the scope of this work than the
charts themselves. The first chart of this kind was published by MacCoull, it is based on
equation (3)42 and features a static value of 0.7 in the double logarithm parenthesis.45,46 The
equation is a two-parameter logarithmic viscosity equation:7
log log(𝑣 + 0.7) = 𝑏1 + 𝑏2 ∙ log 𝑇

(3)

Subsequent development and publication of the equation by both ASTM45 (subcommittee
D02.07) and Walther39 have resulted in the equation mostly being known as the ASTM
equation or the Walther equation:
log log(𝑣 + 0.8) = 𝑏1 + 𝑏2 ∙ log 𝑇

(4)

21

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
The Walther and ASTM forms of the equation (4)37 differed from the original only by the value
of 0.7 being 0.8 in the parenthesis (ASTM later reverted back to the original value of 0.7).45
In both (3) and (4), ν is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s), T is the temperature in °K
and, b1 and b2 are constants of the equation (determined for each sample separately).37,42
Many forms of the equations (3) and (4) have been referred to as the Walther equation in
the literature. Equations of this general type will therefore be referred to as the Walther
equation in this work.
The Walther equation can be utilized for the prediction of the viscosity of a sample at any
temperature, given that viscosity of the sample is initially known at two different
temperatures. The equation should be modified in the following fashion:
Two data points should be used to solve for the constants b1 and b2. The Walther equation
(3) should be rewritten to isolate terms b1 and b2, as shown in equations (5) and (6),
respectively. The viscosity ν3 at temperature T3 can be calculated from the resulting equation
(7) by inserting the values for b1 and b2 into their respective places.a
𝑏1 = log log(𝑣1 + 0.7) +
𝑏2 =

log log(𝑣2 +0.7)−log log(𝑣1+0.7)

− 0.7

∙ log 𝑇1

(5)
(6)
(7)

The viscosity-temperature relationship of a sample can be observed by altering the value of
T3.
Researchers have long been relying on the Walther equation as given in equation (3) and (4),
with the constant C in the general expression (8)8 owning a static value of 0.7 or 0.8. Some
researchers, such as Nissan et al., have suggested that the value of C should be a static value
of 0.6 if the viscosity is expressed in centistokes.8
log log(𝑣 + 𝐶 ) = 𝐴 + 𝐵 ∙ log 𝑇

(8)

Sánchez-Rubio et al. have more recently taken a new approach toward the determination of
the C parameter of the Walther equation. The form of the Walther equation results in a

straight line on the viscosity charts of the form loglog(viscosity) versus log(temperature). Two
points are needed for the mathematical construction of a line, just as was discussed in
equations (5), (6), and (7). It was therefore reasoned that a third point between the two
points already needed would improve the results significantly. This means that the Walther
equation, at three known temperatures, should be solved. An iterative procedure in the
solving of the combined “triple” Walther equation gives a different value of C for each sample
studied (sample specific C). Sánches-Rubio et al. studied lubricants, for which the common
temperatures of viscosity determination are 40 °C and 100 °C. The best temperature to use
for the third point was found to be the mean logarithmic temperature (i.e. 63.25 °C).
However, no mathematical reasoning was found to justify this. 8
Solving for a fluid specific C value is performed in the following way. Three identical Walther
equations are substituted with v1, v2, v3 and T1, T2, T3, respectively.8 Rearranging the
equations gives:
𝐴 = log log(𝑣1 + 𝐶 ) − 𝐵 ∙ log 𝑇1

(9)

𝐴 = log log(𝑣2 + 𝐶 ) − 𝐵 ∙ log 𝑇2

(10)

𝐴 = log log(𝑣3 + 𝐶 ) − 𝐵 ∙ log 𝑇3

(11)

The combination and rearrangement of equations (9) and (10) as well as (10) and (11)
separately give: 8

And if (X + Y) = Z, then the general expression (15) can be obtained:

(15)

The iteration of equation (15) will give the fluid specific value for parameter C. The new
equation encompassing this process of deriving the fluid specific C was named the NFGW
(New Focus on the General Walther equation) equation by the authors of the work.8

Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation

Replacing the parameter b1 in the Walther equation (3) with the double logarithm of a known
viscosity allows for the prediction of the viscosity of a sample at any temperature.41 This form
of the equation is known as the Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation (16):
𝑇

ln ln(𝑣 + 0.8) = ln ln(𝑣𝑜 + 0.8) + 𝑎2 ∙ ln (𝑇 )
𝑜

(16)

where v is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s) at temperature T (K°), vo is the known
kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s) of the sample at temperature To (K°), and a2 is a
parameter of the equation estimated by Aboul-Seoud and Moharam to be equal to -3.7 based
on experimental results (same as b2 in equation (3) and (4)).41
The Aboul-Seoud and Moharam (A-S & M) correlation has been reported to be the best
correlation to use when only a single viscosity measurement of a sample is available. 37
4.1.3

Mehrotra correlation

Mehrotra studied the parameters in equation (3) and found that the kinematic viscosity of
his crude oil samples was in good correlation with the average boiling points (Tb) of the crude
oils.42 The weighted average boiling point (Tb) of a sample is determined by equation (17)37.
𝑇𝑏 = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 ∆𝑥𝑖 ∙ 𝑇𝑏𝑖

(17)

where n is the number of distillation cuts, Δxi the mass fraction of distillation cut i with Σ Δxi
= 1, and Tbi is the mid boiling point temperature of the distillation cut i (K°).
Mehrotra consequently modified the equation (3) to predict the kinematic viscosity of a
sample at any temperature using the Tb of the samples. Examination of the parameters in the
equation showed that the value of b2 did not vary significantly with the Tb and could therefore
be set to -3.7.42 The remaining parameter b1 was expressed in terms of Tb and adopted the
form:
𝑏1 = 5.489 + 0.148𝑇𝑏0.5

(18)

This resulted in the final form of the Mehrotra correlation (19)47:
log log(𝑣 + 0.7) = 5.489 + 0.148𝑇𝑏0.5 − 3.7 log 𝑇

(19)

24

Wolter Rautelin

where v is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s), Tb is the average boiling point (K°), and T
is the temperature (K°).
Further improvement of the correlation has recently been performed by Kotzakoulakis et
al.37 They utilized a set of 137 crude oils to refine the correlation to the following form (20):
ln ln(𝑣 + 0.8) = 7.014𝑇𝑏0.178 − 3.682 ln 𝑇

(20)

where v is the viscosity (cSt or mm2/s) to be estimated, Tb is the 50% mass boiling point (°K),
and T the temperature (°K).37

Moharam correlation

Moharam et al. combined the double logarithm relationship of the Wright blending model
(further discussed in Section 4.2.1) with the previously established correlation of the Tb and
the inverse of the absolute temperature. The resulting general empirical correlation (21) is
said to describe the kinematic viscosity-temperature behavior of hydrocarbon liquids for the
temperature range of 50-550 °C.43

The specific gravity (i.e. relative density) is the ratio of the density of a material related to the
density of pure water.48 The specific gravity can be calculated using equation (22).

where γ is the specific gravity, ρ is the density of a material, and ρw is the density of water.
The density of the material of interest should be known at the temperature of interest in
order to calculate the specific gravity of a sample at the desired temperature.48
Aboul-Seoud and Moharam later verified that the Tb of two oils could possibly be very close
or even exactly the same. The Mehrotra correlation and other correlation relying only on the
Tb of the sample were found to be ineffective in such cases. Aboul-Seoud and Moharam

therefore modified the Mehrotra correlation to consider both the specific gravity and the
average boiling point of the sample.41 This resulted in the equation (23):
ln ln(𝑣 + 0.8) = 4.3414 (𝑇𝑏 ∙ 𝛾)0.2 + 6.6913 − 3.7 ln 𝑇

(23)

where v is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s), Tb is the average boiling point (°K), T is
the temperature (°K), and γ is the specific gravity of the sample.
A recent development of the Moharam correlation has been performed by Kotzakoulakis et
al.37 The effects of the parameters in equation (22) on the prediction of the viscosities of 137
crude oils was studied. Their investigations showed that using the 50 % mass boiling point
instead of the average boiling point lowered the absolute average deviation (AAD) of the
results by about 10 %. The modification of equation (22) by Kotzakoulakis et al. also permits
the use of the specific gravity of the samples at 15 °C instead of using the specific gravity at
the desired temperature, i.e. T in eq. (22) and (23). The reference water density at 15 °C for
the calculation of the specific gravity of a sample was set to exactly 0.999099 g/cm 3.37 The
resulting equation (24) takes the following form:
ln ln(𝑣 + 0.8) = 14.69𝑇𝑏 0.0684 𝛾 0.267 − 3.682 ln 𝑇

(24)

where v is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s), Tb is the 50 % mass boiling point (K°), T is
the temperature (K°), and γ is the specific gravity at 15 °C of the sample.
Using the weighted average boiling point, the 50 % mass boiling point, or the 50 % volume
boiling point for predicting the kinematic viscosity of a sample (in the Mehrotra or Moharam
correlations) presents an issue for samples with incomplete distillation data. The equation
(15) for the calculation of the weighted average boiling point requires the complete
distillation range of a sample to be known.37 The Riazi distribution model presented in
Section 4.1.6 may be used to solve this issue.
4.1.5

Puttagunta correlation

A five-parameter correlation was published by Puttagunta et al.44 in 1992. The correlation
predicts the viscosity of a sample at any temperature based on the viscosity of the sample at
exactly 100 °F (37.78 °C) and atmospheric pressure. The required data can be obtained either
by experimental determination or curve fitting.41 The Puttagunta correlation is defined by
the equation (25)41,44:

where v is the kinematic viscosity at temperature T (in cSt or mm 2/s), T is the temperature
(in °C), and b and s are functions of the kinematic viscosity at 37.78 °C.
It has been found that the equation is essentially the Walther equation expressed for the
specific temperature of 37.78 °C.42 The correlation is nevertheless presented in this work,
since it is also known as the API Procedure 11A4.1 of the API Technical Data Book (TDB). The
API TDB is an annually updated book (a software nowadays) containing the latest technical
data, methods, and standards regarding the areas of petroleum refining officially sanctioned
by the API.49
The API Procedure 11A4.1 discloses a correlation for the prediction of the viscosity of a liquid
petroleum fraction as a function of temperature provided that the kinematic viscosity of the
sample is known at 100 °F (37.78 °C) and atmospheric pressure.41 It features an absolute error
of approximately 5.6 %, according to tests performed by the API and said to work best on
light paraffinic fractions with API gravities over 30° API.50
4.1.6

Riazi distribution model

Riazi has developed a distribution model for multiple properties of uncharacterized fractions
of oils.51,52 The correlation exhibits excellent prediction of boiling points of oils with a
correlation factor (R2) of over 0.99 (see Section 6.1.1 for definition of R2). The Riazi
distribution model is therefore useful for the prediction of the entire distillation curve, the
50 % boiling point, and the weighted average Tb of a sample if only incomplete data is
available.37 The Riazi distribution model is described by the following equations (26) and

Mixing rules for the calculation of petroleum blend viscosities

Mixing rules are calculative tools (i.e. equations) for the prediction of the viscosities of blends
of hydrocarbon mixtures. A variety of mixing rules are available in the literature. Centeno et
al.7 evaluated the performance of a total of 26 mixing rules on the prediction of the viscosity
of various crude oil blends. The overall accuracy of the mixing rules on viscosity prediction of
the crude oil blends were found to be relatively poor, which is why they expanded the
investigation to naphtha, diesel, and vacuum gas oil blends. Only four of the seventeen
generally accepted mixing rules for middle distillates were found to be acceptable in terms
of accuracy when tested. These included the Chirinos, Refutas, Chevron, and Walther mixing
rules.7 A summary of the inputs and outputs of all mixing rules discussed in this work is
provided in Table 9.

Wright blending method

In 1946, Wright proposed a new method for using the ASTM chart (described in Section 4.1.1
in conjunction with the Walther correlation) for predicting blend viscosities. The method has
since proved to be a very effective tool for predicting the viscosity of all sorts of hydrocarbon
blends and mixtures. The method is also referenced in the “ASTM D7152 Standard Practice
for Calculating Viscosity of a Blend of Petroleum Products”, which is another reason why it
will be discussed in this section.56

29

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
The blending method proposed by Wright in 1946 was a method that utilized the charts of
ASTM D341 to predict the viscosities of blends. Here the viscosity-temperature lines of the
components are plotted on the chart and blended by linear proportioning along the log(T)
axis. The advantage of this is that the “blending” is performed at “constant viscosity” instead
of “constant temperature”, which would be the case if the chart were used as originally
intended (see Section 4.2.5). An example of the use of a viscosity-temperature chart
according to the Wright blending method is given in Figure 8, where Oil-A and Oil-B are the
blending components and the long line between these, marked by intercepts O and R, is the
“blend”.53

M. H. Rahmes; W. L. Nelson Viscosity Blending Relationships of Heavy Petroleum Oils. Anal. Chem. 1948, 20,
912–915 (see ref. 53).

The equations for the lines and the intercepts in Figure 8 can be used in a similar fashion to
the Walther equation (see Section 4.1.1) to create a set of equations capable of predicting
the viscosity of a blend mathematically.57 Two viscosity values and the temperatures at which
these were determined are needed for each “component”. This information can be used to
calculate the inverse slope of each line. The information gathered thus far, including the
intended volume fractions of each component, can be used to arrive at the viscosity of the
30

blend by linear proportioning. The prediction of the “blend” viscosity (slope) over a finite
temperature range, as well as the prediction of the viscosity-temperature relationship of the
individual components, similarly to the modified Walther equation (see Section 4.1.1), is
then be possible. This method is referred to as "Modified Wright Method" if mass fractions
are used.57 A simple arrangement of input temperature values for the equation, within the
temperature range of interest, in any spreadsheet software, allow for the graphical mapping
of the resulting “blend” line (including accurate data points).
The “ASTM D7152 Standard Practice for Calculating Viscosity of a Blend of Petroleum
Products” describes the procedures for calculating the estimated kinematic viscosity of a
blend of two or more petroleum products. Two types of blending methods are described in
this standard, the ASTM Blending Method and the Wright Blending Method.58 The ASTM
Blending Method is used for estimating the viscosity of a blend using the kinematic viscosity
of each blend component at two separate temperatures and the blend fractions (volume
fraction) of each component. The fraction of each component needed to prepare a certain
blend, owning a specific viscosity value, can be estimated with this method. Mathematically
transformed viscosity values for each component at the chosen temperature are used to
produce the blend viscosity at said temperature. This method is referred to as "Modified
ASTM Method" in case mass fractions are used. Reversion of the procedure allows for the
determination of the amount of each component that has been used to create a blend of
certain viscosity (only applicable for two component systems). 56,57 The Wright Blending
Method has a far more substantial base in theory, is more accurate, and has been described
in the literature previously.53 Only the Wright Blending Method (of the two) will therefore be
subjected to further testing in this work.
4.2.2

Kendall and Monroe correlation

The mixing rules of the late 1920’s were extremely inaccurate. Even the prediction of binary
blends of pure compounds resulted in preposterous deviations since most mixing rules were
based on the simple linear law of mixtures. Kendall and Monroe subsequently turned to
experimental work; they measured the viscosities of binary systems where the properties of
the components featured a significantly wider separation than those analyzed in previous
studies.54 The Kendall and Monroe equation (30)7,54 was developed based on these
experimental results and adopted the following form:
1/3

𝜇 1/3 = 𝑤𝐴 𝜇𝐴

1/3

+ 𝑤𝐵 𝜇𝐵

(30)

31

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
Where μ is the kinematic viscosity (in cSt or mm2/s) and w the weight fraction of the
components (wA for A and wB for B). The amount of components is undefined, however, Σwi
= 1.7
The Kendall and Monroe equation has been added to the API Technical Data Book (see
Section 4.1.5 for definition) due to the widespread use of the correlation in the petroleum
industry. The equation forms the base for the API Procedure 11A3.1, which is one of the
simpler procedures of the API TDB. The procedure is recommended to be used only for the
estimation of the viscosities of mixtures of components owning very similar “molecular
weights and general character”.59
4.2.3

Refutas index method

The Refutas index method predicts the viscosity of a blend of components based on the
viscosity blending indices of the individual components.7 The method was originally
developed for the prediction of blend viscosities of all petroleum components ranging from
gasoline to vacuum residue.7 The wide application range and satisfactory estimation errors
for multiple products, including the close resemblance to the Chevron mixing rule, is the
reason why the Refutas index method has been included in this work.7 The so called viscosity
blending index (VBI) of each component is separately determined using the following
equation:
𝑉𝐵𝐼𝑖 = 23.097 + 33.469 log log(𝑣𝑖 + 0.8)

(31)

where vi is the viscosity of component i at a certain temperature (the same temperature
should be used for all components).
The VBI of the individual components are then added together while considering the weight
fractions of each component, arriving at the average VBI of the blend (VBIβ)7:
𝑉𝐵𝐼𝛽 = 𝑤𝐴 𝑉𝐵𝐼𝐴 + 𝑤𝐵 𝑉𝐵𝐼𝐵

(32)

where wi is the weight fraction of component i and VBIi is the VBI of component i in the blend.
The VBIβ can be converted to the blend viscosity using the following equation7:
(

𝑣 = 1010

𝑉𝐵𝐼𝛽 −23.097
)
33.469

− 0.8

(33)

32

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
The temperature of the components or the blend is not considered at any point, as seen from
the equations (31), (32), and (33). The viscosity of the blend is therefore calculated at the
temperature at which the component viscosities were determined (i.e. a “constant
temperature” approach). The Refutas index method is not suitable for the prediction of the
viscosity of pure hydrocarbons or blends of only a few of them.55
4.2.4

Chevron mixing rule

The Chevron mixing rule was developed by the Chevron Research Company. 55 It is based on
the Refutas index method and features a simpler approach to the calculation of the viscosity
blending index of a component. The total viscosity blend index of the components is
calculated using volume fractions instead of weight fractions which is also more convenient
since this data is usually more readily available. The Chevron mixing rule is not suitable for
predicting the viscosities of blends of pure hydrocarbons just as its parent method, i.e. the
Refutas index method.55
The VBI of the individual components are calculated using equation (34), the total VBI by
equation (35), and total VBI is finally converted to the blend viscosity using equation (36): 7,55
𝑉𝐵𝐼𝑖 =

log 𝑣𝑖
3+log 𝑣𝑖

𝑉𝐵𝐼𝛽 = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑥𝑖 𝑉𝐵𝐼𝑖

𝑣 = 10

(

3𝑉𝐵𝐼𝛽
)
1−𝑉𝐵𝐼𝛽

(34)
(35)

(36)

where vi is the viscosity of the component i, VBIi is the viscosity blending index of component
i, xi is the volume fraction of component i, VBIβ is the total VBI of the blend, and v is the
viscosity of the blend. The Chevron mixing rule is a “constant temperature” approach
similarly to the Refutas index method.
4.2.5

Walther mixing rule

The Walther equation described in Section 4.1.1 can be transformed to a highly accurate
mixing rule39, known as the Walther mixing rule (37):
log log(𝑣 + 𝐶 ) = 𝑥𝐴 log log (𝑣𝐴 + 𝐶 ) + 𝑥𝐵 log log(𝑣𝐵 + 𝐶 )

(37)

33

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the blend (in cSt or mm2/s), vA and vB are viscosities of
the components, x is the volume fraction of each respective component and C is a parameter
of the equation.7
The Walther mixing rule is the opposite approach to the Wright blending method. Here the
“blending” happens at a “constant temperature” instead of happening at a “constant
viscosity” as in the Wright method.39 This difference in the approaches is displayed in Figure
9.

Figure 9: Graphical comparison of the constant temperature vs. constant viscosity approach. Adapted from:
M. H. Rahmes; W. L. Nelson Viscosity Blending Relationships of Heavy Petroleum Oils. Anal. Chem. 1948, 20,
912–915 (see ref. 53).

The estimation taking place when using the Walther mixing rule is illustrated by the line
owning the intercepts Q, R, and P whereas the estimation of the Wright method is depicted
by the line with the intercepts M, O, and N. Here it can clearly be seen that the Walther
mixing rule line follows a constant temperature value whereas the Wright method line
follows a constant viscosity value.
This constant temperature nature of the Walther mixing rule is also the biggest drawback of
the mixing rule (applicable for all constant temperature mixing rules). The lack of

34

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
temperature variance in the mixing rule requires the viscosities of the blending components
to be known at the temperature of interest of the final blend, which might not be possible
for all neat components (e.g. components owning a low flash point or high freezing point).
4.2.6

Chirinos mixing rule

The Chirinos mixing rule (38)7,60 is an iteration of the Walther mixing rule (37), where the
parameter C has been fixed to a static value of 0.7 based on experimental determination and
the volume fractions have been replaced by weight fractions.
log log(𝑣 + 0.7) = 𝑤𝐴 log log (𝑣𝐴 + 0.7) + 𝑤𝐵 log log(𝑣𝐵 + 0.7)

(38)

where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the blend (in cSt or mm 2/s), vA and vB are viscosities of
the components, and w is the weight fraction of each respective component.7
This version of the equation was originally developed for bitumen-diluent mixtures60 and is
therefore included in this work for comparative purposes.

investigated by a variety of research groups. Examples of previously reported deviations for
the methods are provided in this section. The empirical correlations assessed in this work
have mostly been investigated for the prediction of crude oils. A list of results from the works

oils respectively.41 Kotzakoulakis et al. AADs are the result of estimating the viscosities of 254
different crude oils at both 15 °C and 0 °C (i.e. 308 data points).37
Centeno et al. investigated the accuracy of 17 different mixing rules by estimating the
viscosities of naphtha, diesel, and vacuum gas oil binary blends. The percentage standard
error (SE) for the predicted viscosities compared with experimental results are given in the
original article.7 All mixing rules discussed in Section 4.2, except the Kendall and Monroe
equation (30), performed very well according to the results reported by Centeno et al. (SE
for Kendall and Monroe equation above 10 % at its worst, SE was below 5 % in all other cases).
The Wright blending method, however, was not investigated by the group.

EXPERIMENTAL

Viscosity data for a variety of neat and blended hydrocarbon mixtures was needed for
assessing the performance of the calculative tools found in the literature. Independent
experimental determination of the kinematic viscosities was performed instead of using
commercially available databanks due to repeatability and comparability concerns.
Additional sample properties, required for specific correlations, were determined as well.

5.1

Methodology and plan

The sample matrix was designed to contain an extensive variety of hydrocarbon mixtures.
These included market grade fuels, experimental fuels, oils, and model compounds of the
middle to heavy distillate range. Neat sample properties, sample mixture properties as well
as the effects of cumulatively raising the volumetric ratio of one of the components in the
mixtures was of interest.
An assortment of mixtures was created for the purpose of this work. These included binary
mixtures (mixtures of two components), tertiary mixtures (mixtures of three components),
and quaternary mixtures (mixtures of four components). The mixtures were organized into
five separate groups: four binary sample sets (BS1, BS2, BS3, and BS4) and one separate
sample set for the tertiary and quaternary mixtures (TQ1). The TQ1 sample set was created
and used for validation of the predictive capability of the methods. The tertiary and
quaternary mixtures of TQ1 are mixtures of model compounds and an experimental fuel of
the middle distillate range. This provided a highly complex set of viscosity data that could be
used in the assessment of the models. The TQ1 sample set was, in other words, treated as a
benchmark for the prediction flexibility of the correlations (in regards of input). The need for
an additional group of samples arose during the thesis work, when the correlations requiring
distillation data as input were found (see Section 4.1). An assortment of neat liquid
hydrocarbons was analyzed, and the sample group was named Singular sample set 1 (S1). A
summary of all sample sets are listed in Table 11.

Correlations requiring distillation data as input

An assortment of the mixtures in the sample sets consisted of 0 – 100 vol-% of component A
in a base of component B (applicable for most binary mixtures). Individual cases required
more specific mixtures to be created and some combinations were of interest only at certain
volumetric ratios.
The most relevant experimentally determined physicochemical property, regarding this work,
was the kinematic viscosity of the neat samples and the mixtures thereof. Properties such as
density and distillation data of the samples were determined as well, since these were
needed for the assessment of certain correlations. Additional properties such as freezing
point (see Section 5.3.3 for further information regarding choice of this method) of the
samples, were used to determine viable sample combinations and the temperature limit of
reliable viscosity results for example.
The various individual, binary, tertiary, and quaternary samples discussed above, represent
a scale between middle to heavy distillate liquid hydrocarbon mixtures, thus providing a good
dataset for evaluating the calculative tools found in the literature. BS1-4 and TQ1 were used
to evaluate empirical correlations that require 1, 2, or 3 viscosity data points as input (i.e.
empirical correlations that are useful in situations where 1, 2, or 3 viscosity values of the
sample at differing temperatures are known). The mixing rules were evaluated using BS1-4.
The sample set S1 was in turn, used to evaluate empirical correlations that require the T b
and/or specific gravity of the samples as input (i.e. correlations that are useful situations
where no viscosity data is available and the viscosity of the sample is needed).

Sample preparation

All binary, tertiary, and quaternary mixtures were prepared using volumetric pipettes and
stored in 250 ml glass bottles. A final volume of 200 ml was chosen for the samples. This was
done to simplify the volume ratios and thus ease the blending process in the laboratory. The
volumetric ratios were identical for all binary sample series. 36 binary blends of the range 0
- 100 % were created. The tertiary and quaternary samples investigated in this work were
created by a different logic (e.g. three components of varying vol-% in tertiary blends and
four components of varying vol-% in quaternary blends).

5.3

Analysis

Test methods based on standardized procedures defined by ASTM International and EN ISO
were used in this work. The standard procedures were used since product standards require
all measurements in the industry to be conducted by following these methods. This ensured
realistic results which could be of use when comparing the results to real-world cases.
Additionally, empirical correlations such as the Kotzakoulakis et al. version of the Moharam
correlation (see Section 4.1.4) require specifically the results of ASTM methods as input
data.37 Duplicate measurements were performed for all samples and the average result was
used in further evaluations.
5.3.1

Viscosity, ASTM D445

The viscosities of the samples were determined by the practices defined in the “ASTM D445
Standard Test Method for Kinematic Viscosity of Transparent and Opaque Liquids”. A suitable
amount of each sample was transferred into a Cannon-Fenske routine viscometer of
appropriate size by suction. The viscometers containing the samples were lowered into a
temperature-controlled bath to control and stabilize the temperature of the samples.
Heating and cooling of the bath was controlled by a Lauda Kryomat high performance
thermostat. Multiple baths with different bath mediums were needed due to the wide
temperature range of the determinations. The flow time of each sample was determined
after an appropriate time was allowed for the samples to reach the target temperature. The
viscosity value for each sample was calculated based on the flow time and the calibration
constant of the viscometer. Two consecutive measurements of each sample were made and
an acceptable reproducibility error, r, between each set of values was assured, wherever
applicable. The parameter k is defined for each sample type/temperature combination
separately, in the standard test method, and does not therefore cover the entire range of

39

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
samples in the sample matrix. The final viscosity value for each sample was reported as the
average of these two parallel results (owning an acceptable r value if defined).11
The procedure was repeated for all samples at temperatures of +30, +20, +10, 0, -10, -20, 30, and -40 °C. Some of the neat or mixed samples defined in the sample matrix were,
however, limited by the relatively high freezing points or low flashpoints of the components.
Example of average result calculation:
Flow time 1 = F1
Flow time 2 = F2
Viscometer calibration constant = CV
Viscosity of first measurement = F1 ∙ CV = V1
Viscosity of second measurement = F2 ∙ CV = V2
Average of results = (V1 + V2) / 2 = VA
r = VA ∙ k
5.3.2

Density, EN ISO 12185 (ASTM D4052)

The density of the samples was determined according to the standard procedure “EN ISO
12185 Crude petroleum and petroleum products – Determination of density – Oscillating Utube method”. A Mettler Toledo DM45 DeltaRange density meter was used for the
measurements.61
A small amount of sample (typically less than 1.2 ml) is introduced into a temperaturecontrolled sample cell (15 °C in this case). The oscillation frequency of the sample is
determined when the sample has acclimatized to the correct temperature. The density of
the sample is calculated from this value using cell constants (previously determined using
calibration fluids with known densities).61

Freezing point, IP 529 (ASTM D7153e1)

The change in fluidity of a sample consisting of liquid hydrocarbons of the middle to heavy
distillate range can be determined by multiple methods. These include for example the cloud
point (i.e. when the first paraffins in the sample crystallize on a visually observable scale), the

40

pour point (i.e. when the sample becomes stagnant in nature instead of fluid), and the
freezing point (i.e. when the last of the crystallized paraffins are liquified). The freezing point
of the samples was chosen to be used in this work since even the slightest amount of
crystallized paraffins could skew the delicate viscosity results, and none of these would be
present above the temperature reported as the freezing point of the sample. The freezing
point of the samples was determined in this work according to the standard procedure IP
529: Determination of the freezing point of aviation fuels – Automatic laser method using an
ISL FZP 5G2s freezing point analyser.62
The sample is cooled down at a rate of 10 °C / min ± 5 °C while simultaneously being
irradiated by a laser light. Two detectors within the instrument track the formation of
paraffinic crystals and the opacity of the sample. The cooling of the sample is discontinued
and heating of the sample at a constant temperature is initiated once both paraffin crystals
and opacity has been detected. The freezing point of the sample is registered when all
paraffin crystals have returned to liquid phase and the sample is clear.62
5.3.4

Distillation range, ASTM D86

The boiling range characteristics of the samples in sample set S1 were determined according
to the “ASTM D86 Standard Test Method for Distillation of Petroleum Products and Liquid
Fuels at Atmospheric Pressure”. The test method comprises the atmospheric distillation of a
sample of petroleum product to determine the boiling range of the sample. The distillation
is performed in a laboratory batch distillation unit which can determine the entire boiling
range quantitatively. In other words, the entire distillation range is recorded in relation to
the volumetric ratio of product that has been recovered at each temperature (e.g. the
temperature at which, for example, 50 volumetric percent of a sample has been recovered).63

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The empirical correlations and mixing rules determined to be the most promising for our
efforts in Section 4, were subjected to rigorous testing. The results are discussed in this
section of the thesis. Results are presented in the form of adjusted R2 values due to the
impracticality of a detailed analysis of the substantial amount of experimental data
generated in the present work. The detailed experimental results have been compiled in a
separate report.64

6.1

General results

The results for the viscosity determinations of the neat components of sample sets BS1, BS2,
BS3, BS4 and TQ1 (BS1N, BS2N, TQ1N1 etc.) as well as selected mixtures from all sample sets
(BS1M, BS2M, TQ1M1, TQ1M2 etc.) are presented in Figure 10. Selected components have
been used in multiple sample sets and are therefore denoted by two sample set codes (e.g.
BS1 + BS2).

Figure 10: General results of viscosity determinations.

A surprising agreement between the temperature profiles of the neat components as well as
the mixtures studied in this work was observed. It was speculated based on these results that
the prediction of all sample sets would therefore be possible with relatively satisfactory
accuracy.

R2 adjusted

The coefficient of determination (R2) is a quantity used for assessing the accuracy of a
mathematical model (predictive description of experimental data). It relates the variance in
the data which is explained by the mathematical model and that which is explained by simply
assuming an average of the experimental points.65 The R2 of a model (or correlation) may be
calculated using equation (40).
𝑅2 = 1 − (

𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑠
𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡

)=1−

∑𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝜂
̂𝑒𝑥𝑝 −𝜂𝑒𝑠𝑡 )

2

∑𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝜂
̂𝑒𝑥𝑝 −𝜂
̅𝑒𝑥𝑝 )

where SSres is the sum of squared residuals of the model, SStot is the sum of total squared
residuals, 𝜂̂ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 represents the experimental data, 𝜂𝑒𝑠𝑡 represents the estimated data, 𝜂̅ 𝑒𝑥𝑝
is the average of all experimental data and 𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑝 is the number of experimental data points .
It is a consequence from (40) that, very accurate models have R2 values close to 1. In contrast,
poorly accurate ones may have very low and even negative values of R2. However,
assessment of model accuracy using R2 should be done with caution as this parameter can
be artificially improved by adding sufficient terms (parameters to a model). The adjusted R2,
which considers the amount of terms in a model, should preferably be used instead.65 All R2
adjusted results presented in this work were calculated according to equation (41).
(𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑝 −1)

𝑅2 𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 = 1 − ((1 − 𝑅2 ) ∙ (𝑁

𝑒𝑥𝑝 −𝑁𝑝 −1)

)

(41)

where Nexp is the number of experimental data points and Np is the number of terms in the
model. The adjusted R2 results are presented in the form of 1 - adjusted R2 due to high
accuracy of the correlations and mixing rules. The logic regarding the accuracy of a model for
1 – adjusted R2 is the contrary compared to the adjusted R2. In other words, very accurate
models have a 1 – adjusted R2 close to 0 and poorly accurate ones may have very high or
even negative values of 1 – adjusted R2.
6.1.2

Weighted average and 50 % boiling point

The volume specific boiling points of a sample (i.e. at which temperature a certain volume of
sample has been distilled) may be determined by the method described in ASTM D86 (see
Section 5.3.4). These results will give the Volume Average Boiling Point when calculations are
performed according to equation (42).66

43

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
𝑉𝐴𝐵𝑃 = 0.2 ∙ (𝑇10% + 𝑇30% + 𝑇50% + 𝑇70% + 𝑇90% )

(42)

The temperatures at which certain weight percentages of a sample have been distilled are
provided by the ASTM D2887 method. These results will provide the Weight Average Boiling
Point (WABP) when used in equation (41).66
𝑊𝐴𝐵𝑃 = 0.2 ∙ (𝑇10% + 𝑇30% + 𝑇50% + 𝑇70% + 𝑇90% )

(43)

Both the VABP and the WABP can technically be used as input data in correlations where the
Weighted Average Boiling Point is required as input (see Section 4.1.3 and Section 4.1.4).
The 50 % boiling point can naturally be of two types as well. It can either be the 50 % mass
boiling point (50 % MBP, determined by ASTM D2887) or the 50 % volume boiling point (50 %
VBP, determined by ASTM D86). It was decided, based on early testing, that only the volume
specific boiling points would be used to assess correlations where boiling point data was
needed (the resulting accuracy of the model was found to be better).

6.2

Empirical correlations

The empirical correlations were investigated by testing the predictive accuracy of the
methods based on experimental data obtained exclusively for this work. Two of the empirical
correlations, the Walther correlation and the Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation, could
be assessed using sample sets BS1, BS2, BS3, BS4 and TQ1 (i.e. binary, tertiary, and
quaternary mixtures). The remaining two correlations of interest (the Kotzakoulakis version
of the Mehrotra correlation and the Moharam correlation), were assessed using sample set
S1. A list of the adjusted R2 results of the correlations is provided in Table 12.

An average of all sample set results is provided for correlations where multiple sample sets
have been assessed (the average of multiple adjusted R2 results has no statistical meaning,
the results in Table 12 are therefore merely suggestive).
6.2.1

Walther correlation

Primary investigations of the Walther correlation were focused on utilizing the traditional
form of the equation (i.e. equations (3), (5), (6), and (7)). It was found at a very early stage
that the parameters b1 and b2 could be calculated in two different ways. One was the
traditional way described by equations (5) and (6), whereas the other was the method
described in ASTM D341. The method described in the standard is meant to be used for
situations where the kinematic viscosity to be predicted falls under 2.0 mm 2/s (cSt).45 This
was a common occurrence in the dataset and both approaches were therefore investigated.
The difference in adjusted R2 for the entire BS1, for example, was found to be approximately
1 ∙ 10-9 (cold inputs were used, see below for more information). The method reported in the
standard was, however, used in all subsequent calculations (precautionary action).
Another aspect of the Walther correlation is that the input temperatures can be varied. This
was tested on all sample sets, where applicable (due to temperature (fluidity) constraints).
The input viscosities used for comparing the calculations were taken at +20 °C and 0 °C in one
case, and -20 °C and -40 °C in the other. The surprising result was that the accuracy decreased
when the applied input values were taken from a higher temperature range. This can be
speculated to result from the temperature dependence of liquid viscosities where the slope
of the curve grows in a non-linear fashion when temperature decreases, thus increasing the
uncertainty of the prediction toward the colder temperatures (see Figure 10). Using the
colder temperature viscosity data as input can be speculated to have decreased the
inaccuracy at the more critical temperature range with regards to viscosity prediction. A
visual interpretation of the problem is given in Table 13.

The uncertainty naturally decreases around the chosen inputs (notice the striped cells above,
between, and below the chosen input values). Use of the warm inputs only affects the yellow
and orange rows positively, whereas the cold inputs affect all the red and orange rows.
Let’s, for example, assume that we know the viscosity of a sample at +20 °C and 0 °C. This
will allow us to predict the viscosity of a sample at +30, +10, and -10 °C with increased
accuracy, whereas the prediction accuracy of the +40, -20, -30, and -40 °C points are
unaltered. When adding up the residuals of the results (estimated value – experimental
value), the sum will simply be larger than if we would know the viscosity at -20 °C and -40 °C.
The lower sum of residuals for the scenario where the colder values are known, is caused by
the fact that the worst inaccuracies of the dataset (right half of Table 13 fair and poor cells)
are improved by the input values and surrounding effect (striped cells). The +40, +30, +20,
+10, and 0 °C accuracy is naturally good to fair, which leads to a smaller sum of residuals.

Adjusted R2 values for all sample sets studied are presented in Figure 11. The results have
been separated into results for both cold and warm inputs.

Figure 11: 1 - Adjusted R2 results of the Walther correlation.

It was only possible to use the warmer inputs for BS4. The lack of cold data partially explains
the significantly lower 1 – adjusted R2 for BS4. The prediction of TQ1 data with warm input
values resulted, unsurprisingly, in the highest 1 – adjusted R2 result of all sample sets. The 1
– adjusted R2 for TQ1 was approximately 0.012058 when warm inputs were used. Switching
to cold inputs surprisingly resulted in the largest 1 – adjusted R2 of the Walther correlation
results (1 – R2 adj. ≈ 0.000012). This will be the lowest 1 – adjusted R2 result reported in this
thesis and is a strong indication of the flexibility of the Walther correlation. The use of cold
input values was therefore concluded to be the best approach for lowering the local
prediction uncertainty of the cold region. The difference in prediction accuracy when going
from warm inputs (Figure 12) to cold inputs (Figure 13) is presented in the form of parity
plots below.b

warm result (left half) can clearly be seen from this figure.

The general accuracy of the results is clearly greatly improved when cold input values are
used. All the stray data points have been adjusted and most of the data points overlap the
reference line. The spread of the results in the colder half of the plot has also been corrected.

___________________________________________________________________________
Additionally, a general trend was observed where the R2 adjusted of the individual sample
sets would increase when the input range was broadened (e.g. +20 °C and -40 °C viscosity
values were used as inputs).
The original correlation gave some promising results as can be seen in Figure 11, Figure 12,
and Figure 13 above. Previously reported results of the NFGW equation (see Table 8)
attracted favorable attention and was therefore investigated despite the excellent results
already obtained by using the first regression analysis. Unfortunately, the 1 – adjusted R2 of
the BS1 results had a value of 0.002807 when the NFGW approach was tested with cold
inputs (1 – adjusted R2 for BS1 using the original approach and cold inputs ≈ 0.000073). It
could therefore be concluded that the NFGW approach is an unnecessarily complicated
method for lighter hydrocarbon liquids than its original design.
A more straightforward approach of estimating the fluid specific C value was considered in
the present work. The fluid specific value of the C parameter was derived by regression using
the Solver function in ©Microsoft Excel. A comparison of the original parameter approach
versus the regressed parameter approach showed that the Walther correlation is extremely
well optimized in its native state. The adjusted R2 of the prediction was found to decrease or
increase by a maximum of 1 ∙ 10-5 only. It could therefore be concluded that the regression
of the C parameter was unnecessary for the investigated samples.
6.2.2

Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation

The Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation was evaluated using the same sample sets as the
Walther correlation (BS1, BS2, BS3, BS4, and TQ1). Even the additional sample set S1 could
be utilized in this case. The amount of input values required for the A-S & M correlation is
half of what is required for the Walther correlation (one vs. two viscosity values for each
component, see Table 8). The difference in 1 – adjusted R2 between the two methods was
only approximately 0.04 for BS1 when the original parameters from the literature were used.
The 1 – adjusted R2 for all sample sets are provided in Figure 14.

49

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________

Figure 14: 1 - Adjusted R2 results for the Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation.

The 1 – adjusted R2 for the binary sample sets decrease when going from BS1 toward BS4.
This can be explained by the stepped decrease of the amount of data points to be predicted
in each sample set. TQ1 presented again, unsurprisingly, the highest 1 – adjusted R2 of all
sample sets studied. The size of the error, however, is very small when considering the
content of the sample set. The excellent results for TQ1 suggests that this correlation may be
able to reliably predict the viscosity of complex mixtures (i.e. is flexible regarding input
variability).
The regression of the parameters using the Solver function in ©Microsoft Excel was tested
for the A-S & M correlation as well. The parameters were regressed for each sample set
separately. The results of the assessment are depicted by the red bars in Figure 14. A
significant increase in the prediction accuracy can be achieved by regressing the parameters.
The A-S & M correlation is nearly as accurate as the Walther correlation in the prediction of
sample sets BS1, BS2, BS3, BS4, and TQ1, when the parameters are regressed for each set
separately. The prediction of the viscosities of sample set S1 provided satisfactory results as
well. Substantially less accurate prediction results are afforded when the parameters are
regressed for all sample sets collectively. The substantial difference between regressed and
original parameters is shown, as an example, for sample set BS1 in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

(Figure 12 and Figure 13) can be observed. It can therefore be concluded that the AboulSeoud and Moharam correlation is able to predict the viscosity of middle to heavy distillates
if the parameters are regressed for a test data set.
6.2.3

Mehrotra correlation

The original Mehrotra correlation as well as the Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra
correlation were investigated using the sample set S1. The original correlation requires the
weighted average boiling point to be used as input whereas the Kotzakoulakis version accepts
the 50 % mass boiling point as input (see Section 4.1.3). Exact information was not found in
the literature regarding the type of average boiling point to be used as input in the correlation.
It was however decided, as previously mentioned, that only the volume average boiling
points would be used as inputs. The Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra correlation
features an increase in accuracy (see Table 10), decrease in amount of variables, and
simplification of required inputs. Excellent results were observed when the Kotzakoulakis
version was tested (see Section 6.2.3.1). The performance of the original Mehrotra
correlation and the A-S & M version were therefore not evaluated in this work.
6.2.3.1

Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra correlation

Kotzakoulakis et al. explicitly report the use of the 50 % mass boiling point as input in their
version of the correlation.37 Only the 50 % volume boiling points (50 % VBP) was, however,
investigated in the present work. The sample set S1 was used to evaluate this version of the
Mehrotra correlation. Regression of the parameters of the correlation using the Solver
function in ©Microsoft Excel was performed in this case as well.
The original parameters of the correlation provide extremely high 1 – adjusted R2 results (1
– adjusted R2 ≈ 1.13262), indicating that the original parameters in fact are optimized for
crude oils or other heavier hydrocarbon liquids. The results for S1, using the original
parameters from the article, are presented in Figure 17.

Figure 17: Results for the Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra correlation using original parameters.

It is clear from the Figure 17 that the results are far from ideal. The adjusted R2 result also
indicates that even the average of the viscosity results in S1 provide a better fit than the
model (see Section 6.1.1 for definition of R2 adjusted). Prediction accuracy can be improved
substantially by regressing the correlation parameters. The results for S1, using regressed
parameters, are presented in Figure 18.

53

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
A substantial difference between the parity plots can be observed when the parameters are
regressed. A significant increase in the 1 – adjusted R2 can also be observed (1 – adjusted R2
of regressed correlation ≈ 0.001807). An additional observation can be made from the results.
This is the fact that the 50 % VBP can be used as input instead of the 50 % MBP without issues.
Overall, the Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra correlation can be considered as a viable
option for viscosity prediction of middle to heavy distillates. The correlation should, however,
be considered only in cases where no viscosity data is available.
6.2.4

Moharam correlation

The original Moharam correlation (equation (21)) is said to describe the viscosity of a sample
between 50 and 550 °C. The original version of the correlation was therefore not of interest
regarding the efforts of this work (temperature range studied in this thesis= +40 to -40 °C).
The version developed by A-S & M was excluded due to the same reason as the A-S & M
version of the Mehrotra correlation was excluded (see Section 6.2.3). The Kotzakoulakis
version of the Moharam correlation was, however, of interest and is therefore discussed in
this section.
6.2.4.1

Kotzakoulakis version of the Moharam correlation.

The Kotzakoulakis version of the Moharam correlation has been reported to result in lower
deviations than the original Moharam correlation (see Table 10). This version requires the
50 % mass boiling point and the specific gravity at 15 °C to be used as inputs. The 50 % VBP
was used in this work due to the promising results obtained for the Kotzakoulakis version of
the Mehrotra correlation (see Section 6.2.3.1). The reference density for water at 15 °C,
needed for the calculation of specific gravity, was set to 999.099 kg/m3 as instructed in the
original article.37 Sample set S1 was used in the investigations due to the input constraints.
Regression of the parameters of the correlation was performed using the Solver function in
©Microsoft Excel in this case as well. The results for S1, using original parameters reported
in the literature, are presented in Figure 19.

Figure 19: Results for the Kotzakoulakis version of the Moharam correlation using original parameters.

The difference between the Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra and Moharam
correlations is essentially only the addition of the specific gravity at 15 °C and a single
parameter. The initial results portray a situation where the accuracy would decrease when
an additional experimental input is provided. This, however, goes against the trend observed
thus far. Regression of the correlation parameters was therefore performed. The results are
presented in Figure 20.

___________________________________________________________________________
Remarkable improvement of the prediction accuracy and therefore 1 – adjusted R2 (1 –
adjusted R2 for regressed parameters ≈ 0.002489) is observed when comparing Figure 19 and
Figure 20. The 1 – adjusted R2 is, in this case, slightly higher for the Kotzakoulakis version of
the Moharam correlation when compared to the Kotzakoulakis version of the Mehrotra
correlation. The accuracy is, however, extremely similar in both cases and the Moharam
correlation should, therefore, be considered if density data for the samples is available. A
possible explanation for this is that two experimental points are relied upon in the Moharam
correlation instead of only one in the Mehrotra correlation (Walther correlation vs. A-S & M
correlation for example). This can be speculated to increase the probability of highly accurate
predictions, as for example, in cases where significant error in the distillation point
measurement has occurred. Furthermore, the use of the 50 % VBP as input was not found to
cause issues in this case either.
6.2.5

Puttagunta correlation

The Puttagunta correlation was not investigated in this work because it is essentially the
Walther equation expressed for the specific temperature of 37.78 °C. 42

6.3

Mixing rules

The mixing rules discussed in Section 4.2 were evaluated using sample sets BS1, BS2, BS3,
and BS4. The Chirinos mixing rule and the Refutas index method are iterations of the Walther
mixing rule and the Chevron mixing rule, respectively. The Chirinos and Chevron rules are,
however, included for comparative purposes. The Wright blending method and the Kendall
and Monroe mixing rule are evaluated in this section as well due to their widespread use in
the industry. A list of the average adjusted R2 results of the mixing rules is provided in Table
14 (results in Table 14 are only suggestive).

The results for all sample sets and mixing rules are presented in the form of 1 – adjusted R2
values in Figure 21.

Figure 21: 1 - Adjusted R2 for all mixing rules.

It is clearly seen from Figure 21 that the Kendall and Monroe mixing rule is the least accurate
of all mixing rules. The Kendall and Monroe mixing rule should be used only for estimating
viscosities of blends of components similar in nature (see Section 4.2.2, the inaccuracy of the
results was expected). The Kendall and Monroe mixing rule was therefore excluded from all
further investigations. An illustration of the 1 – adjusted R2 results excluding the Kendall and
Monroe results is presented in Figure 22.

Figure 22: 1 - Adjusted R2 for all mixing rules excluding the Kendall and Monroe results.

A considerably clearer overview of the results may be depicted when the Kendall and Monroe
mixing rule is removed from Figure 21. The results displayed in Figure 22 indicate that all of
the remaining mixing rules are extremely accurate. The Chevron mixing rule and the Chirinos
mixing rule, however, can be ruled out when compared to their respective analogues. The
accuracy of the Wright blending method is unexpectedly high when considering the amount
of inputs required for each of the mixing rules (see Table 9). The C parameter of the Walther
mixing rule should be optimized for each individual situation in the same manner as the C
parameter in the Walther correlation (see Section 4.2.5). The C parameter was set to a
constant value of 0.7 in the initial tests (for which the results are presented in Figure 22). The
effect of altering the C parameter was investigated in detail due to the promising results
already obtained with the static C parameter. The C parameter of the Walther mixing rule
was regressed using the Solver function in ©Microsoft Excel. The 1 – adjusted R2 results for
the regressed Walther correlation are presented in Figure 23 (other results are unaltered and
presented for comparative purposes).

The Walther mixing rule produces excellent results when a static value of 0.7 is used for the
C parameter as can be seen from the parity plot above. The influence on the relatively high
1 – adjusted R2 for the BS3 sample set is caused by the inaccuracy of predicting the colder
results (right half of Figure 24). This can be corrected by regression, however, at a cost in the
accuracy of the warm results (left half of Figure 25).

Figure 25: Parity plot of Walther mixing rule results using regressed parameters.

The parameter of the Walther mixing rule has been regressed in the results displayed in
Figure 25. The colder results (right half of parity plot) have improved by the regression. This
has however come at the expense of the accuracy of the warmer results (left half of plot) as
they became slightly overestimated. Regression of the parameter in the Walther mixing rule
should therefore be considered carefully and for each situation separately.
The accuracy of the Walther mixing rule is, nevertheless, excellent and it was therefore
concluded that the it is the best mixing rule, when the viscosity for both mixture components
are known at the desired temperature (i.e. the temperature of interest of the resulting
mixture). The Wright blending method produced impressive results with 75 % less input data
than the rest of the mixing rules and should therefore be considered in cases where the
viscosity of both components is not known at the temperature of interest (the Wright
blending method is capable of predicting entire mixture datasets with only four inputs, 16
inputs are required for all other cases presented in this section).

CONCLUSION

A total of eight empirical correlations and six mixing rules were evaluated in this thesis. Four
of the empirical correlations and all the mixing rules were investigated in detail using
experimental data.
Effective methods for predicting the viscosity of a wide assortment of liquid hydrocarbons,
using multiple types of input data, were identified. The Walther correlation proved to be an
extremely effective method for predicting viscosity when two viscosity data points are known
for a sample. It was also found that the input viscosities used in the Walther correlation for
calculating the viscosity of a sample, should be determined at as distant temperatures as
possible to improve the overall accuracy of the results. Further investigations should,
however, be conducted to validate this claim.
The Aboul-Seoud and Moharam correlation proved to be effective in predicting the viscosity
of liquid hydrocarbon mixtures using only one viscosity data point of a sample. The effect of
varying the temperature at which this measurement is taken was not investigated. It can
however be speculated that a colder temperature would be more beneficial regarding
prediction accuracy for the temperature range studied in this thesis. The correlations
requiring distillation data as input were initially found to be extremely inaccurate for the
investigated samples. Situation specific regression of the correlation parameters was found
to result in substantial improvements for all correlations, besides the Walther correlation.
The Kotzakoulakis versions of the Mehrotra and Moharam correlations, which were initially
found to be inaccurate for the samples tested in this thesis, were later found to be as accurate
as the Walther correlation when the parameters were regressed.
The restriction of viscosity prediction was found to be the availability of input data and not
the accuracy of the correlation as previously anticipated. The four correlations studied were
found to provide incredibly accurate results. It can be concluded that the viscosity of
hydrocarbon liquids of the middle to heavy distillate range was reliably explained based on a
few selected experimental points. A list of required inputs, with increasing accuracy level, is
provided below:

61

•

50 % volume boiling point and density at 15 °C

•

50 % volume boiling point

•

Viscosity at two separate temperatures (preferably as far apart as possible)

•

Viscosity at one temperature

Further work on empirical correlations should concentrate on the development of the
Kotzakoulakis version of the Moharam correlation. The viscosity data or the 50 % volume
distillation point of two samples may be the same and would therefore result in the same
prediction results. Including the specific gravity into the calculations may be beneficial for
the prediction accuracy in situations of the aforementioned type (all other correlations utilize
only one type of physicochemical data as input).
It was determined based on the investigations performed in this thesis that the most
promising mixing rule for middle to heavy distillates is the Walther mixing rule. It is highly
accurate in its native form and does benefit substantially from regression when it comes to
complex blends. The Walther mixing rule requires substantial amounts of input data if the
viscosity of a blend is to be predicted at multiple temperatures (due to the constant
temperature nature). This is the situation for all mixing rules studied in this thesis, except for
the Wright blending method. The Wright blending method is close to being as accurate as
the Walther mixing rule without regression and can therefore be of great use when limited
viscosity data of the blending components is known. Relatively high inaccuracy may, however,
be expected when the viscosity of complex mixtures is estimated using the Wright blending
method. The method should therefore be used with caution in these cases. Further work
regarding the mixing rules should therefore be aimed toward the optimization of the Wright
blending method by regression.
The general aim of the thesis was, in other words, achieved. Multiple precise methods for
viscosity prediction of neat components as well as mixtures thereof were identified. A few of
the approaches, however, require additional investigations to be optimized.

SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Utvärdering av kalkylmetoder avsedda för estimering av kolvätevätskors
viskositet

Traditionella oljeraffinaderier är massiva anläggningar där råolja separeras och omformas till
diverse produkter. Flera processteg krävs för att förädla de olika fraktionerna till användbara
produkter och egenskaperna hos slutprodukterna kan således variera kraftigt.
Råvaruutbudet har dessutom utvidgats betydligt under de senaste årtionden tack vare den
växande klimatmedvetenheten. De flesta produkterna som skapas i ett raffinaderi är därmed
specifikationsprodukter, dvs. diverse standardiseringsorgan ställer krav på olika
nyckelegenskaper hos produkterna.
Viskositet är ett mått på den interna friktionen av en fluid (dvs. vätska, gas eller ånga) och
beskriver “tjockheten” av ifrågavarande fluid, till exempel är vatten “tunnare” än honung
som är betydligt “tjockare”. Viskositeten för vatten är därmed lägre än viskositeten för
honung. Viskositeten kan uttryckas endera som dynamisk (absolut) viskositet eller kinematisk
viskositet. Den kinematiska viskositeten används i de flesta metoderna som diskuteras i
denna avhandling. Viskositet innebär därmed kinematisk viskositet i resten av denna svenska
sammanfattning ifall inget annat meddelas.
Viskositet är en av de viktigaste egenskaperna hos produkter som består av kolväten i
vätskefas. En för hög viskositet hos till exempel bränslen kan förorsaka problem med
bränsletillförseln samt höja utsläppen eftersom droppstorleken vid insprutning i
förbränningskammaren ökar (sämre förångning leder till ofullständig förbränning). En för låg
bränsleviskositet kan däremot orsaka indirekta problem via den resulterande låga
smörjförmågan hos bränslet. Resultatet är oftast total funktionsoduglighet av
bränsletillförselsystemets väsentliga delar. Viskositet är även en av de viktigaste
egenskaperna som ska tas i beaktade då kolvätevätskor transporteras i till exempel
rörledningar. En pålitlig metod för att generellt kunna approximera viskositeten för olika
kolvätevätskor skulle därför vara behövd. Syftet med denna avhandling var att utvärdera
lämpligheten av välkända empiriska korrelationer för estimeringen av diverse
kolvätevätskors viskositet. Även så kallade blandningsregler (mixing rules) undersöktes.
Dessa används för att estimera viskositeten hos en blandning som har skapats eller skall
skapas genom att blanda en eller flera kolvätevätskor av känd konsistens.

8.1.1

Estimering av komplexa kolväteblandningars viskositet

Viskositeten hos en fluid uppstår i teorin som en följd av omplaceringen av rörelsemängd
mellan molekylerna som fluiden består av (intern friktion). Omplaceringen sker i gaser och
ångor genom kollisioner av glest stationerade molekyler. Omplaceringsmekanismerna hos
vätskor är däremot mycket mera komplicerade eftersom molekylerna är mycket närmare
varandra. Denna komplexitet härstammar från att krafterna som är involverade i
mekanismerna är svårare att beskriva. Som följd av detta försvåras även estimeringen av
vätskornas viskositet med hjälp av teoretiska mekanistiska modeller (som försöker förklara
de komplicerade mekanismerna matematiskt). De flesta mekanistiska modellerna tar i
beaktande både temperatur och tryck vid estimeringen av viskositet. Dagens mekanistiska
modeller lyckas estimera viskositeten för diverse fluider vid både höga temperaturer och
höga tryck med relativt låga avvikelser. De mekanistiska modellerna innehåller dock oftast
orimligt många parametrar som måste härledas genom regression. Regressionen av en stor
mängd parametrar inför onödig komplexitet i beräkningarna samt ökar risken för förhöjda
avvikelser i estimeringen. System som är under höga tryck eller temperaturer är dock inte av
intresse i detta arbete. De flesta processerna inom kemiindustrin sker vid tryck som kan anses
vara låga eller medelhöga.

Tryckets inverkan på systemet kan därmed försummas i

beräkningarna. Betydligt enklare (fast ändå svåra) empiriska korrelationer, som beskriver
förhållandet mellan viskositet och andra fysikalisk-kemiska egenskaper hos kolvätevätskor,
kan användas för att estimera vätskornas viskositet i förhållande till temperatur.
De flesta empiriska korrelationerna som beskrivs i litteraturen är baserade på ekvationer
utvecklade av Vogel, Walther eller Andrade. I litteraturen kan en tydlig trend gentemot
korrelationer som baserar sig på Walther-ekvationen urskiljas. Den genomsnittliga avvikelsen
för ekvationer av denna sort är nämligen betydligt lägre än tillvägagångsätten som baserar
sig på tillämpningar av de andra ekvationstyperna. De mest lovande ekvationerna av denna
typ, utvalda på basen av rekommendationer och i litteraturen uttryckt prestanda, beskrivs i
detta arbete. Vissa av metoderna nämns som en följd av att de har en stark anknytning till
standardiserade procedurer i oljeindustrin.
Walther-korrelationen baserar sig på den generella ekvationen (3). De kännetecknande
dragen för Walther-korrelationen är dubbellogaritmen i vänstra ledet av ekvationen samt
den enkla logaritmen i högra ledet.
log log(𝑣 + 0,7) = 𝑏1 + 𝑏2 ∙ log 𝑇

(3)

64

Wolter Rautelin

___________________________________________________________________________
där v är den kinematiska viskositeten (cSt eller mm2/s), T är temperaturen (°K) och b1 samt
b2 är konstanter (bestäms skilt för varje prov).
Genom att skriva om ekvation (3) och utnyttja experimentellt fastställda värden för viskositet
vid två skilda temperaturer kan man bestämma konstanterna b1 och b2 för ett specifikt prov
enligt följande:
𝑏1 = log log(𝑣1 + 0,7) +
𝑏2 =

log log(𝑣2 +0,7)−log log(𝑣1+0,7)
log 𝑇1 −log 𝑇2

∙ log 𝑇1

(5)

log log(𝑣2+0,7)−log log(𝑣1+0,7)

(6)

log 𝑇1 −log 𝑇2
𝑏1 −𝑏2 ∙log𝑇3

𝑣3 = 1010

− 0,7

(7)

Den ursprungliga Walther-korrelationen kan således användas för att estimera viskositeten
för ett prov vid godtycklig temperatur, då provets viskositet vid två temperaturer är känd.
Flera olika versioner av ekvationen bakom Walther-korrelationen existerar. Versionerna av
ekvationen kan anses som lösningar för olika situationer där endast begränsad
viskositetsinformation eller ingen viskositetsdata över huvud taget finns tillgänglig.
Ekvationerna har utvecklats av diverse forskargrupper under det senaste århundradet. En
grov lista på korrelationer (ekvationer), behövliga indata och typer av utdata som ges av
ekvationerna framställs i Tabell 1.

Syftet för alla korrelationer är den samma, det vill säga utöka informationen gällande
temperaturens inverkan på en vätskas viskositet (se kolumnen för utdata i Tabell 1).
Kolvätevätskor, som till exempel bränslen, är blandningar av upp till tusentals olika
föreningar. Varje förening har en unik kokpunkt vilket leder till att kokpunkten för

65

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
kolvätevätskor sprids över en relativt bred temperaturskala. Kokpunkten för kolvätevätskor
rapporteras således som en skala på basen av mängden prov som har kokat över vid en viss
temperatur (destillationsdata). Det vägda medelvärdet för denna skala (Tb) beräknas enligt
ekvation (17).
𝑣ä𝑔𝑡 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑣ä𝑟𝑑𝑒 𝑇𝑏 = ∑𝑛𝑖=1 ∆𝑥𝑖 ∗ 𝑇𝑏𝑖

(17)

Det vägda medelvärdet för Tb används som indata i Mehrotra-korrelationen och Moharamkorrelationen. Densitetstalet som används som ytterligare indata i Moharam-korrelationen
kallas även relativ densitet och är ett mått på densiteten av en substans, jämfört med
densiteten av rent vatten.
Korrelationerna som vi har diskuterat hittills kan endast användas för att estimera
viskositeten för en kolvätevätska då tillräckliga data för att tillfredsställa någon av
korrelationerna finns tillgänglig. Då viskositeten för blandningar av en eller flera
kolvätevätskor med känd viskositet (viskositetsinformation erhållen genom experimentellt
arbete eller estimering med empiriska korrelationer) vill estimeras, måste så kallade
blandningsregler (mixing rules) användas. Blandningsregler är alltså ekvationer som ger
viskositeten för en blandning av kolvätevätskor på basen av utgångsmaterialens
viskositetsinformation och diverse parametrar som endera beräknas med hjälp av
experimentellt data eller bestäms genom regression. Centeno et al. undersökte prestandan
på 26 olika blandningsregler genom att estimera viskositeten för blandningar av nafta, diesel
och vakuumgasolja. Endast fyra av dessa ansågs vara funktionsdugliga på basen av
noggrannheten av estimeringarna. Blandningsreglerna som undersöktes i detta arbete samt
indata och utdata för respektive regel framgår i Tabell 2. En del av reglerna beskrivs endast
för att de har en stark anknytning till standardiserade procedurer i oljeindustrin och är därför
väsentliga, men de ger nödvändigtvis inte de bästa approximationerna.

Experimentell del

Fem olika binära blandningar (BB1, BB2, BB3 osv.) av olika kolvätevätskor skapades för att
undersöka prestandan av de olika empiriska korrelationerna och blandningsreglerna.
Komponenterna som användes i blandningarna bestod av försäljbara och experimentella
bränslen samt modellföreningar av medel- till tungdestillatsklassen. Blandningar med
volymförhållandet 0 - 100 % undersöktes (inklusive utgångsmaterial). Viskositeten
bestämdes mellan +40 och -40 °C med 10 °C intervall vid så många punkter som möjligt
(beroende på frys- och flampunkt). I vissa fall undersöktes även tertiära och kvaternära
blandningar. Dessa resultat inkluderades bland de fem olika binära blandningarnas resultat
vid tillhörande platser. De empiriska korrelationerna som använder kokpunktsdata som
indata hittades mitt i arbetet och utvärderades således med en skild datamängd som bestod
av ett brett sortiment singulära kolvätevätskor (singulär datamängd 1, SD1).
8.1.3

Resultat

Storheten R2 utsäger hur bra en modell beskriver experimentellt data. Modellens
estimeringsfel jämförs med estimeringsfelet då ingen modell över huvud taget används (felet
då beräknat medeltal och experimentella data jämförs). Justerat R2 är en storhet som tar i
beaktande mängden parametrar som modellen innehåller. En modell som beskriver
experimentella data exakt uppvisar ett justerat R2 på 1,00. Resultaten i denna svenska
sammanfattning presenteras för det mesta i formen av 1 – justerat R2 eftersom metoderna
som undersöktes uppvisar mycket höga värden för justerat R2. Logiken bakom 1 – justerat R2

67

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
är motsatt till vanliga justerade R2. Detta betyder att metoden är exaktare desto närmare 0
resultatet är. En mycket inexakt metod uppvisar höga eller till och med negativa resultat för
1 – justerat R2.
Den stora mängden data som krävdes för att framställa dessa resultat har samlats i en separat
rapport.64
BB1-BB5 användes för att utvärdera två empiriska korrelationers prestanda (Waltherkorrelationen samt Aboul-Seoud och Moharam-korrelationen). Walther-korrelationen visade
sig vara mycket noggrann och uppvisade ett mycket lågt 1 – justerat R2 (resultatet för till
exempel BB1 ≈ 0,00007). Två olika tillvägagångssätt för att bestämma konstanterna b1 och b2
undersöktes (ekvationerna (5) och (6) samt metoden som framförs i standarden). En
obetydligt liten positiv inverkan på 1 – justerat R2 observerades (förbättring på 1 ∙ 10-9 för till
exempel BB1), men metoden ur standarden användes för säkerhets skull ändå. Det framgick
också från resultaten att det lönar sig att använda viskositetsdata från kallare temperaturer
som indata i Walther-korrelationen i vårt fall (se Tabell 3) och att noggrannheten i allmänhet
växer då indatat väljs för två temperaturer som är så långt ifrån varandra som möjligt.
Walther-korrelationen visade sig vara noggrannare än Aboul-Seoud och Moharam (A-S & M)
-korrelationen. Detta var förväntat eftersom A-S & M-korrelationen inte avviker betydligt
från den traditionella Walther-korrelationen och mängden indata i relation till Waltherkorrelationen är hälften mindre. Resultaten är mycket imponerande med tanke på
minskningen i mängden indata. Resultaten kunde förbättras betydligt genom att bestämma
BB specifika parametrar för A-S & M-korrelationen genom regression (utfördes med hjälp av
Solver funktionen i ©Microsoft Excel). Noggrannheten för A-S & M-korrelationen steg
således till en lika hög nivå som Walther korrelationen. Det justerade R2 för BB1 med
ursprungliga parametrar samt med regressionsparametrar framförs som ett exempel i Tabell
3.

SD1 användes för att utvärdera prestandan av korrelationerna som kräver kokpunktsdata
som indata. Mehrotra-korrelationen använder endast det vägda medelvärdet av
kokpunkterna (Tb) för att estimera viskositeten av ett prov. Två olika versioner av Tb kan
användas i beräkningarna, Tb beräknad på basen av kokpunkter registrerade då en bestämd
massa har destillerats (WABP, Weight Average Boiling Point) och Tb beräknad på basen av
kokpunkter som registrerats då en bestämd volym har destillerats (VABP, Volume Average
Boiling Point). Endast kokpunkten då 50 volymprocent av en blandning har kokat över mättes
för proven i SD1 eftersom endast Kotzakoulakis version av Mehrotra-korrelationen var av
intresse för denna avhandling. Kotzakoulakis et al. uttrycker explicit att kokpunkten vid 50
massaprocent skall användas men 50 volymprocent användes ändå (logiskt sett mera
noggrann då mätmetoder jämförs). Otroligt höga värden för justerade R2 registrerades då de
ursprungliga parametrarna användes (se Tabell 4), vilket tyder på att den ursprungliga
versionen faktiskt är utvecklad för tyngre kolvätevätskor (till exempel råolja). Regression för
att hitta de optimala parametrarna var det logiska nästa steget (genomfördes också i detta
fall med hjälp av Solver funktionen i ©Microsoft Excel). En imponerande ökning i
noggrannheten kunde urskiljas då de nya parametrarna användes. Resultaten framförs i
Tabell 4.
Moharam korrelationen utnyttjar både Tb och densitetstalet för att estimera viskositeten av
provet. Densitetstalet är temperaturberoende och skall därmed bestämmas skiljt för varje
temperatur. Tillgång till detta data fanns inte vilket resulterade i att endast en modifierad
version av Moharam korrelationen (Kotzakoulakis version, som använder kokpunkten vid 50
volymprocent och densitetstalet vid 15 °C, som indata) utvärderades. Denna korrelation
visade sig också vara mycket inexakt då de ursprungliga parametrarna användes för att
estimera viskositeten hos våra prov. Resultaten förbättrades betydligt då parametrarna
optimerades genom regression. Resultaten framförs i Tabell 4.

Ur Tabell 4 går det tydligt att avläsa att de ursprungliga versionerna av Kotzakoulakis version

69

Wolter Rautelin
Master’s thesis
___________________________________________________________________________
typen som undersöktes i detta arbete. Imponerande resultat för båda korrelationerna kunde
dock erhållas då parametrarna optimerades genom regression. Justerade R2 för Kotzakoulakis
version av Mehrotra korrelationen är något högre än justerade R2 för Kotzakoulakis version
av Moharam korrelationen. Detta tyder på att införingen av densitetstalet vid 15 °C i
beräkningarna har en negativ inverkan på resultatet. Användningen av två fysikalisk-kemiska
storheter i beräkningarna kan dock anses vara nyttigt för noggrannhetens skull i allmänhet
(50 vol-% kokpunkten för flera kolvätevätskor kan till exempel vara exakt lika).
Puttagunta korrelationen undersöktes inte eftersom korrelationen visade sig vara Walther
korrelationen skriven i en sådan form att indata kunde accepteras endast vid exakt 100 °F.
Blandningsreglerna undersöktes genom att jämföra 1 – justerat R2 som resulterade då
blandningsreglerna estimerade alla datapunkter i BB1-BB5 (exklusive indata). Resultaten för
detta framställs i Figur 1.

Figur 1: 1 - justerat R2 för de bästa blandningsreglerna.

Av blandningsreglerna visade sig Walther-blandningsregeln vara exaktast. I Figur 1 har
parametrarna i Walther-blandningsregeln optimerats genom regression. Waltherblandningsregeln är exaktast fastän den inte skulle optimeras genom regression.
Wright-blandningsregeln kan anses vara så gott som lika noggrann med tanke på hur mycket
mindre indata som krävs (se Tabell 2). Wright-blandningsregeln kan vara mycket nyttig i
sådana fall där flampunkt eller fryspunkt inhiberar viskositetsbestämningen för en eller båda
70

Wolter Rautelin

___________________________________________________________________________
av komponenterna vid den önskade temperaturen. Wright-blandningsregeln skall dock
användas med försiktighet i sin nutida form, resultateten kan vara mycket inexakta ifall
blandningen är komplex (se det höga resultatet för BB3 i Figur 1).
8.1.4

Konklusioner

Då viskositetsdata vid två temperaturer är tillgängligt för kolvätevätskan av intresse skall
Walther-korrelationen i sin ursprungliga form definitivt användas. Ifall viskositeten vid endast
en temperatur är tillgänglig skall Aboul-Seoud och Moharam-korrelationen användas.
Kotzakoulakis version av Mehrotra- och Moharam-korrelationen är klart och tydligt i sin
ursprungliga form optimerade för tyngre kolvätevätskor än de som undersöktes i denna
avhandling. Dessa korrelationer skall således inte användas för estimeringen av medel- eller
tungdestillat i sin ursprungliga form. Regressionen av parametrarna i Kotzakoulakis version
av Mehrotra- och Moharam-korrelationen kan förbättra resultatet betydligt. Båda
versionerna är därmed godtagbara för viskositetsestimering ifall det behövliga data finns
tillgängligt. Av dessa undersökningar framgår det trots allt att Moharam-korrelationen högst
antagligen är säkrare än Mehrotra-korrelationen eftersom densitetstalet tas i beaktande.
Puttagunta-korrelationen är en förenklad version av Walther korrelationen och skall därmed
undvikas. De bästa och mest universella blandningsreglerna presenterade i litteraturen är
Walther- och Wright-blandningsreglerna. Walther-blandningsregeln borde dock prioriteras
ifall tillräckliga data finns tillgängligt. Framtida insatser skall enligt dessa resultat fokusera på
förståelsen och utvecklingen av främst Moharam-korrelationen. Vidare forskning gällande
optimeringen av Wright-blandningsregeln genom regression kan även vara nyttigt för
situationer där indata för Walther-blandningsregeln inte finns tillgängligt. De allmänna
målsättningarna för denna pro gradu-avhandling uppfylldes.
