Title: Interest group lobbying advocacy – A study of interest groups’ utilization of
lobbying strategies in the EU
Master’s thesis – Political Science with Mass Communication
Pages: 53
Supervisor: Kim Strandberg
Introduction: Is lobbying causing a democratic deficit in the European Union (EU)? This
topic has many times surfaced in the academic world. Pluralism is in theory set out to be a
functional coexistence of different values and interest in a modern democracy. The purpose
of this thesis is to determine whether the business-oriented interest groups have more
influence compared to their competitors. The thesis research question is specified as
following: Are there any differences between business and environmental organizations
use of lobbying strategies when influencing policymakers?
Theoretical framework: Pluralism is based on the thought that conflicts and dialogue
between different parties will result in a common good. However, the apparent inequalities
between the different interest groups operating within the EU suggests that the current state
of the EU resembles the elitist form of pluralism.
Methodology: The comparative design serves as the research design in this thesis. The
data was collected and summarized in the form of a systematic literature study. The sample
of articles were all evaluated through various inclusion- and exclusion criteria presented in
chapter 3 and 4.
Results: Factors such as organizational type, access, budget, goals, institutional setting,
and the type of policy issue impacts the choice of strategy. Both the business- and
environmental organizations utilize a combination of strategies. This depends on both the
resource situation as well as the policy issue. Salient and less complex issues are usually
lobbied through outside strategies. Inside strategies are often utilized when lobbying less
popular issues.
Conclusions: No universal theories exist that can be used in all cases involving businessand environmental NGOs (organizations without any connection to the nation-state). All
the factors mentioned in the result chapter need to be taken into consideration when
examining lobbying behavior. The generalizability of the results is limited due to the
research design and the small sample of studies included in the thesis.
Key words: Lobbyism, Pluralism, NGO, Inside lobbying, Outside lobbying

1.Introduction
1.1 Scientific relevance
Since the beginning of the 1980s, there has been a rapid increase of interest groups in
the European Union (EU). Policymaking in the EU has always been a complicated and
long-spun process. The reason behind this is largely due to the fact that the union
member states differ in many ways, therefore, this affects the political landscape.
While all of this is true, there is also a large number of interest groups that seek to
influence politics with the use of different means, strategies and through information
exchange. The term lobbying has a somewhat negative tone, this may partly be due to
the lack of transparency that surrounds lobbying. In some cases, there is a thin line
between what is considered as lobbying or corruption. According to Korkea-aho
(2019), interest groups or lobbying actors who engage in illegal forms of lobbying will
only end up hurting their own cause and reputation (Korkea-aho, 2019).
Simultaneously, it is worth to examine whether certain interest groups e.g. (business
interest groups) have more means to influence policymakers compared to their peers.
In recent years, climate policy has gradually received more space on the EU agenda.
In this light, this new emerging policy area is both intriguing from a societal and
academic perspective. The main of focus of this thesis will be aimed at clarifying
which actors are most prominent in climate policy and what kind of strategies these
actors adopt when lobbying climate policy.
From a social science perspective, this is also highly relevant, considering the fact that
interest groups have significant abilities to influence the decision-making process. The
question is if there is an unhealthy imbalance between different types of interest
groups, and whether there is a democratic deficit as a result of this. The idea of a
pluralistic society is not considered to be harmful towards democracy, quite the
contrary, it is said to contribute to the democratic process (Van Schendelen, 2010).
However, the inequalities between the business interest groups and other NGOs are so
prevalent, that is practically impossible not to suspect the emergence of elite pluralism
in the lobbying realm within the EU. Coen (1997) defined elite pluralism as an interest
arrangement where access is generally restricted to few policy players for whom
membership is competitive and strategically advisable. Based on this, it is not too far1

Robert Johansson
fetched to claim that the present lobbying platforms are skewed towards the resource
heavy business interest organizations (Broscheid & Coen, 2003). Some scholars state
that the interest groups’ participation in today’s policy-shaping is a valuable asset to
the democratic process (Gullberg, 2008). Past empirical work done on lobbying has
focused on understanding under which conditions interest groups influence public
policy. Another important question is also how many interest groups get access to
decision-makers (Beyers, 2004; Bouwen, 2002, 2004; Eising, 2007). It is also highly
relevant to ask if lobbyists should focus on cooperating with likeminded, or if the
attention should be aimed at potential adversaries.

1.2 Research aim
The main objective in this master’s thesis is to determine if there are any apparent
differences between how industrial and business organizations lobby compared to
environmental organizations. The research question is presented below:
Which are the differences between business and environmental organizations use of
lobbying strategies when influencing policymakers in the European Union? Strategies
refer to type of arenas (i.e. Inside, Outside) the organizations are using and what type
of influence they utilize (i.e. arguing, advocacy, coercion and encapsulation). These
variables will be described in detail later in the thesis. The purpose of this thesis is to
question the presumption that the policy process regarding climate policy is dominated
by the business-oriented interest groups. In a broader sense this also raises the question
whether lobbying undermines the democratic principles of the EU. As earlier stated,
one of the main scientific gaps in the research field of lobbying is the long-term effects
of this phenomenon. However, this will not be the objective of this thesis. The
reasoning behind this has to do with the strict time frame and the limited extent of this
thesis.

1.3 Disposition
The brief introduction that has been presented above provides a glimpse into what this
thesis will process, as well as its relevance from a societal perspective. Chapter 2 is
related to the theoretical framework of past research done regarding lobbying. The first
part of the chapter will cover the past theories and definitions of relevant terms in the
field as well as the EU decision-making and climate policy in general. The last part is
dedicated to interest group behavior and influence and their relation to EU officials. In
2

Robert Johansson
chapter 3, the discussion regarding the choice of methodology and various research
designs will be presented. This is followed by chapter 4 that will analyze the results of
the systematic literature study. Chapter 5 summarizes all the results and the final
discussion of the thesis. Finally, chapter 6 includes a Swedish summary of the thesis.

2. Theoretical framework
2.1 Terminology
2.1.1 Defining Lobbyism
Lobbyism can be described in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most common way to
describe it is as a long-term relationship between interest groups and legislators
(Ainsworth, 1997; Loomis, 2002). The information exchange between interest groups
and legislators creates a strong bond between the two actors (Loomis, 2002). Past
studies emphasize that effective lobbying depends on trust and credibility if it is to last
(Gullberg, 2008). Building these relationships takes time (Ainsworth, 1997; Bouwen,
2004; Coen, 2004; Matthews 1960; Mazey & Richardson, 2002). The more traditional
definition states that lobbying is an act to influence and shape public-policy. In spite
of this, past studies on interest groups and lobbying have focused on single policy
decisions within a limited period of time according to Gullberg (2008). These studies
have been criticized for directing way too much attention toward visible and
controversial policy decisions (Baumgartner & Leech, 1996).

2.2 Lobbying and democratic theory
In most cases, the global belief is that democracy is the preferred or the most legitimate
form of governance after the survival of countless tyrannical, monarchic rules
throughout history (Karr, 2007). Karr (2007, 8) states the following: all representative
systems have had to confront the opportunities offered as well as the threats posed by
the formation and activities of interest groups. Karr (2007) believes that the view of
interest groups and their role in a representative system has changed. The reason
behind this is believed to be a result of the growing numbers of advocates in favor of
pluralist theory and the introduction of new political concepts. Karr (2007) also
concludes that increased awareness and technological progress sparked public
transparency on interest group lobbying. In some cases, this has also led to better
regulative measures to control their influence on decision-making (Karr, 2007).
Karr (2007) questions if and how interest groups can be integrated into democratic
systems without damaging the legitimacy-based grounds that democracies stand on.
Despite this, in a democratic system, all interests have the right to present their
demands to both the government and the public. These groups usually employ similar
4

Robert Johansson
methods to voice their opinions. Karr (2007, p 63) states that the main concern is the
fact that there is strong evidence that the resources deployed and used for these
methods are far from equally distributed. The fact is that business organizations clearly
outweigh their competitors.
Since the 1990s, scientists have engaged in research regarding interest group lobbying
in the EU. A large proportion of the work has been dedicated to analyzing the workings
of the relevant EU institutions from the lobbying groups that are active in the Union
(Mazey et al., 1993c, Buholzer, 1998). Scholars such as Decker (2002), Schmuck,
(1993) and Zweifel (2002) question the lack of democratic legitimacy of the EU
institutions. This criticism has led to the fact that most experts have called for the
implementation of state-centric approaches. The multi-level governance system relies
on policy networks that go beyond the official institutions in the consideration of
political players shaping the EU democracy (Karr, 2007). According to Karr (2007)
the present work aims at adding to current models by choosing an interest group
focused on lobbying centric approaches. This joins the short list of works combining
the question of EU democratic legitimacy and the role of public and private interest
groups (Karr, 2007).

2.2.1 Democratic accountability
From a democratic perspective, the imbalance between interest groups is without
question concerning. Especially since accountability is regarded as one of the key
cornerstones in a democratic system (Karr, 2007). In a representative democracy,
elected officials are expected to represent the people’s interest. This is the reason why
influential interest groups that only represent small fractions of society, may be
considered a threat to the democratic principles. Karr (2007) claims that transparency,
informality and negotiations in non-elected bodies such as committees and special
interest representatives tend to score badly in accountability. Since the decisions
cannot be traced back to the decision-makers, this in turn means that the decisions are
not controlled by the public (Karr, 2007).
Karr (2007) states that corporatism and consociational democracy (the concept of
power sharing between elites and other social groups) share defining characteristics
such as elite cooperation, societal segmentation, restricting membership and a
preference for bargaining versus competitive majoritarian processes of decisionmaking. Czada (2000) supports the view that consociational democracy and
5

Robert Johansson
corporatism are alternatives rather than substitutes. Czada (2000) describes this as
consociationalism, corporatism and joint decision-making. Czada (2000) claims that
corporatism and a weak government cancel each other out. Corporatism relies on a
strong state counterpart to ensure its cohesion and monopoly. In contrast, joint
decision-making results in governmental weakness according to Czada (2000). All in
all, this indicates that it is ill advised to assume that consociational democracies cater
to interest intermediation (Czada, 2000).

2.2.2 Lobbying and corruption
Despite all the literature on lobbying and corruption, the similarities and the
differences between these two phenomena are widely disregarded according to
Giovannoni (2011). The most plausible difference between lobbying and corruption is
that lobbying is a way of seeking influence without overstepping the legal boundaries.
Corruption on contrary is illegal (Giovannoni, 2011). However, this is not necessary a
useful distinction in itself. Giovannoni and Campos (2007) suggest that different legal
systems may disagree on specific examples. The underlying differences might be
traced back to the means used when obtaining the influence. In short, lobbying can be
described as a series of activities that influence the decision-making without providing
the representatives with direct gains (Giovannoni, 2011, 12). However, if the
politicians are paid to vote in a certain way, this is a standard example of corruption.
Despite these distinctions, they may still generate confusion according to Giovanonni
(2011). Therefore, it is also possible to establish the differences between lobbying and
corruption is by looking at the targets of their rent-seeking activity (Giovannoni, 2011).
Campos and Giovannoni (2007) propose that corruption is directed at rule enforcers
while lobbying focuses on rule makers. This distinction is important for several
reasons, some of which are conceptual while others may resolve the issues in empirical
literature on lobbying and corruption (Giovannoni, 2011). From a conceptual
standpoint it is worth questioning if lobbying and corruption are both risk-seeking
activities with different targets, are they complements or substitutes? Damania et al.
(2004) argue that they should be seen as complements. This is based on the fact that
lobbying is primarily aimed at laws that undermine law enforcement, which opens the
possibility to pursue corruption. The substitute argument is supported by Harstad and
Svensson (2010). This notion is based on that lobbyists have the possibility to change
the rules, therefore corruption is unnecessary. Giovannoni (2011) supports the claim
6

Robert Johansson
that, lobbying and corruption are substitutes. The results show that lobbying is more
likely to take place in democratic countries where the media are independent and in
contexts which the overall political process is democratic (Campos & Giovannoni,
2007). Political instability does not necessarily impact lobbying, but it certainly has
effects on the levels of corruption according to Giovanonni (2011). Lobbying is more
prevalent when the executive has less veto power. In contrast, corruption is more
occurring when the executive has greater veto power according to Giovanonni (2011).
The evidence also indicates that federal or decentralized states favor lobbying over
corruption. Campos and Giovannoni (2007) sample point out that lobbying is the most
effective way of exerting political influence for firms. The risks of corruption seem to
outweigh the potential benefits (Karr, 2007). Overall, the fundamental difference
between lobbying and corruption is determined by where the influence is sought.

2.3 The complex nature of lobbying
European lobbying has proven to be both diverse and complex at the same time, and
this makes it very difficult to make any reliable theoretical generalizations (Bennett,
1997; Greenwood et al. 1992; Van Schendelen, 1994). Bouwen (2004) proclaims that
measuring influence is problematic in the world of political science (Bouwen, 2004).
Van Schendelen (1994) also underlines that access to legislators does not necessarily
guarantee influence in the end. However, there is a close connection between influence
and access (Bouwen, 2004). This was also mentioned by Truman (1951, 264)
regarding interest group politics:
Power of any kind cannot be reached by a political interest group, or its leaders,
without access to one or more key points of decision in the government. Access,
therefore, becomes facilitating, intermediate objective of political interest groups.
The development and improvement of such access is a common denominator of the
tactics of all of them.

According to Bouwen (2007) the key to understanding lobbying activities connected
to business interests in the EU is directly related to the exchange relationship between
private and public actors. In other words, it is an interaction between two
interdependent organizations. While taking this into account, it would be a grave
mistake to regard business lobbying as a unidirectional activity of private actors trying
to reach and influence the European institutions (Bouwen, 2007). However, the
7

Robert Johansson
European institutions are more than willing to interact with private actors, because
they need to maintain the relationship in order to fulfill their purpose. This exchange
relationship is based on a prior model developed by sociologists in the 1960s for the
study of interorganizational relationships. Bouwen (2007) states that this serves as a
starting point for the analysis of interaction between business interests and public
actors in the EU. Bouwen (2007) also mentions that past scholars have used exchange
theories in the past, either implicitly or explicitly, in order to study European interest
intermediation (Greenwood et al. 1992; Buholzer, 1998; Pappi & Henning, 1999;
Bouwen, 2007). These theories indicate that the interaction between private and public
organizations can be conceptualized as a series of interorganizational exchanges.
These models closely resemble the resource dependence perspective of Pfeffer and
Salancik (1978). Resources in this case meaning information. Both theories emphasize
that the resource exchange is paramount for organizations, whereas the resource
dependency focuses more on the ensuing interdependence between organizations
(Pfeffer, 1997). However, the resource dependence perspective suggests that
organizations are not internally self-sustaining (Aldrich & Pfeffer, 1976). This makes
them dependent on their own surroundings. Therefore, in order to survive, they ought
to interact with organizations that possess the resources they desire (Pfeffer &
Salanick, 1978). This pattern also applies to the EU. The literature conducted on EU
interest has pointed out what pulled interest into the European public policy, and now
the scholars face the task of explaining what the current institutional demands are
(Coen, 2007). This also includes political goods the EU interest organizations provide
to the policy process (Coen, 2007). Coen (2007) also emphasizes that if the
concentration is aimed at the formal aspects of model shaping in European interest
politics, the process must be complemented with strict empirical tests of the models.
This is supported by Baumgartner and Leech (1996) as they state that good theories
require good data.

2.3.1 Lobbyism and the EU institutions
The interplay between EU officials and lobbyists is for many considered a natural
process, where interest groups are considered as the aggressors. But is this really the
case? Svendsen and Brandt (2009) states that the EU Commission is often viewed as
a neutral bureaucracy with vital information to help governments find a common
ground. The Commission undoubtedly plays a vital role in the EU machinery. In fact,
8

Robert Johansson
it has the executive role of drafting legislative proposals. The institution is also a
technocratic agency with around 20000 civil servants. This in turn means that it is not
a political entity (Svendsen & Brandt, 2009). Svendsen and Brandt (2009) questions if
the Commission is really the neutral and independent agency as it often projected to
be. This uncertainty has also led to skepticism among some scholars. George and
Bache (2006) have outlined three major flaws of the Commission. Firstly, the
commission has the ultimate right to initiate legislation by providing proposals to the
Council of Ministers. The Council has the power to the approve the proposals, which
in turn means that there is indirect democratic control involved in this process.
Simultaneously, the Council also have the possibility to consult the Commission about
legislative proposals in various areas, this applies to the Parliament as well. Another
problem is the fact that the Council of Ministers procedures are also encased in
secrecy. This may be a benefit when it comes to conducting negotiations but at the
same time this means that the public have little insight. To some degree this means
that the Commission have the ability to choose and not choose between different
policies. Secondly, the Commission is capable to “Europeanize” a sector with the
assistance of powerful interest groups. The third flaw is the Commissions ability to
create new networks among producers (Svendsen & Brandt, 2009; George & Bache,
2006). Ultimately, this means that the Commission can promote the inclusion of
affected interest groups during the policy formulation process in order to draw upon
expert knowledge from various actors. This allows the Commission to subsidize
interest groups that can support the policy forming process. This indicates that the
Commission might not be the neutral body as previously projected (Svendsen &
Brandt, 2009).
The reality is, out of the three central institutional organs in the EU, the Commission
is the main center of decision-making. Consequently, this makes the Commission the
main target for lobbyists in Brussels. The Parliament may be the financial controller
of the EU Commission, but it has no real political power according to Svendsen and
Brandt (2009). Svendsen and Brandt (2009) state that despite this, the Parliament has
gained considerably more power since the addition of direct elections in 1979. With
the addition of various inter-institutional agreements, the emergence of legislative acts
and co-decision procedures, the Parliament is from now on one of the most lobbied
institutions in the EU. One the of the most powerful tools that the Parliament possess
9

Robert Johansson
is the budget discharge. Beyond this, the Parliament must approve any newly assigned
commissioners. Furthermore, The Parliament also has the ability to dismiss the
Commission with a two-thirds majority (Svendsen & Brandt, 2009). However, it is not
possible to dismiss individual members of the Commission. The Parliament also
participates in the legislative process as a counseling body. With the increase in power,
interest groups direct their attention towards EUs other institutions as well. In order to
reach the policymakers, interest groups can choose between three different routes in
order to reach the policymakers. This is displayed in the figure presented below.

As displayed in the figure above, it is shown that an interest group can either choose a
national, international or transnational passage to the EU policymakers (Van
Schendelen, 2010, 131). These three lanes allow the interest group to adapt to the EU
playing field and if successful, outmaneuver other interest groups. At the same time,
groups with shared interests tend to unite in transnational organizations that operate
10

Robert Johansson
close to the EU machinery (Van Schendelen, 2010). Other variants also exist, such as
the more independent confederations as well as the ad-hoc coalitions. Gullberg (2008)
conducted an empirical analysis based on interviews carried out with interest group
representatives and decision-makers active in both Brussels and Oslo. The sample of
interviewees consists of members of the business and environmental NGOs as well as
decision-makers from the executive branch and the Parliament. Gullberg (2008) claims
that business organizations lobby both the Commission and the Parliament. They also
lobby the Council despite being deemed an institution difficult to influence. However,
the Commission is still considered to be the main target for lobbyists in the EU
according to Gullberg (2008). The development of the changing institutional balance
at the EU level, have led to the plotting of reduced bureaucratic capture. In fact, the
completion of 300 single market directives, gave the Commission bigger issues to cope
with and hence needed less technical information according to Coen (2007).
Subsequently, the Commission was able to deny access to its 300 committees and
around 1200 forums from lobbyists. This indirectly led to the emergence of ad hoc
alliances in the EU. These alliances had both economic and political incentives to form
these coalitions (Coen, 2007). However, as stated previously, the Commission also
had several reasons to include these groups in the policy process. The first reason is
based on the wish to increase its direct legislative input into the markets through the
implementation of directives and technical standards. Secondly, the Commission
believed that firms represented a channel to the member states and could act as an
intermediary in intergovernmental negotiations (Coen, 2007). The third reason is a
result of the fact that many officials were convinced that the business sector represents
a legitimate political constituency and that their legitimacy were reinforced by the
informational exchange between the two parties. In the end, the Commissions efforts
encouraged firms to continue and establish these political alliances. This in turn
attracted a second wave of firms into the European public policy system according to
Coen (2007).

2.4 EU climate policy
If we rewind the time a couple of decades, it becomes evident that climate policy once
had very little political importance on the EU agenda. However, after the 1990s
political turmoil and the financial crisis that crippled the whole continent, the climate
policy issue sought to become a high-profile area in its own right (Boasson &
11

Robert Johansson
Wettestad, 2013). According to Boasson and Wettestad (2013), year 2005 and
onwards, the pace has increased rapidly. By the end of the decade, numerous new
ambitious objectives had been presented within the EU as probable solutions to the
problem. This was also complemented by a heap of new binding policies for the EU
members states. This transition period has been far from smooth. Global challenges
like the financial crisis resulted in that climate change and all related challenges fell of
the top layer of the political agenda. Boasson and Wettestad (2013) claim that the EU
climate policy agenda is characterized by four central climate sub-policies. These
policies are the emissions trading system (ETS), carbon capture and storage (CCS),
renewables as well as the energy policy for buildings. Boasson and Wettestad (2013)
state that there are significant differences and effects of these policies. The ETS creates
a harmonized European market for greenhouse gas permits. However, this only
indirectly induces technology development.
The EU has on its own embraced the renewable energy and in CCS, with
the ultimate objective to transform the industries connected to these areas. The EU
energy policy for buildings also serves as a framework for national construction of
buildings, which provides the member states with guidelines on how to determine
which technology standards that needs to be taken into consideration (Boasson &
Wettestad, 2013). As expected, with the extent of these four policies, there is no
wonder that both business- and environmental groups are keen on influencing these
policy areas. Especially, considering the fact that they have significant implications
for both the environment and the economy in the continent (Fagan-Watson et al.,
2015). The latest IPCC report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) indicate
that the global economy faces severe consequences of climate change (Fagan-Watson
et al. 2015). The business sector acknowledges that they face reputational risks and
regulations that impact their operations on the continent. However, the research also
suggests that forward looking businesses can create new products and services in this
new transition. Climate policy is of material concern for most businesses (FaganWatson et al. 2015). With this established, the next section will cover the two central
interest groups that attempt to influence climate policy in the EU.

2.4.2 Climate policy actors
The European field of climate policy is dominated by two central interest groups:
business and environmental organizations (Greenwood 2003; Svendsen 1999,2001).
12

Robert Johansson
Business organizations focus on competitiveness and lobbying to achieve
economically cost-effective emission reductions according to Gullberg (2008). They
also state the importance of a global solution to the climate change dilemma. Which
means that all developed countries should come to a common agreement on how to
tackle the problem (Gullberg, 2008). The Union of Industrial and Employer’s
Confederations of Europe (UNICE), argues that mitigation of greenhouse gases will
halter the competitiveness of EU compared to countries without any commitments.
This stalemate ultimately jeopardizes the goals laid out year 2009 in the Lisbon Treaty.
The counterpart, The Climate Action Network Europe, (CAN Europe) consisting of
environmental NGOs working on climate change issues, demands a 60-80 % reduction
in the developed countries emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 (Gullberg, 2008).
The goal is motivated by the desire to prevent the temperature to increase by more than
2 degrees celsius, and a recognition that developing countries need to increase their
efforts (Gullberg, 2008).

In other words, there is a cleavage between the

competitiveness of European businesses and an environmental effective climate
policy. This deadlock in climate policy is ultimately a causation of conflicting interests
and a path of brushy decision-making (Gullberg, 2008).

2.5.1 Lobbying techniques
According to Van Schendelen (2010) it is old knowledge that in pluralist countries,
every organization has some sort of capacity to influence its environment. However,
this is always fragile in both scope and domain. This means that organizations are
always dependent on the ever changing and challenging environment. The changing
complex environment postulates that organizations adapt to change their influence
behavior continuously (Van Schendelen, 2010). Specific challenges are presented in
the form of friends or foes, or in short as stakeholders. Every organization has two
main interest (Van Schendelen, 2010). First and foremost, at its input side, it has to
acquire the means of operation it needs from the outside. This consists of a budget,
support and information (Van Schendelen, 2010). Secondly, at its output side it has to
deliver what is demanded from the outside, for example special products and services
support and other contributions to its consumers. In this sense, every organization is
in fact an interest group. This is not less true for the ministry or the EU itself than for
a company or a group of citizens (Van Schendelen, 2010, 37).

13

According to Van Schendelen, (2002), organizations ought to seize opportunities and
tackle threats in order to survive. This includes both at their input side and their output
side. Only with regards to internal operations can an organization act more or less
independently. However, this autonomy is not necessarily sufficient for survival
(Coen, 2007). There are strong variations depending on a couple of different factors,
the organizational structure, as well as type, (public or private) the quantity of
resources and the organizations reputation (Van Schendelen, 2010). One central trait
that is essential for all organizations is the awareness of the everchanging environment.
Interest groups that seek to influence its environment in the EU can choose from four
different traditional lobbying techniques according to Van Schendelen (2010). The
first one is coercion. For instance, can a National ministry influence its home
environment by issuing legislation that is ultimately upheld by police court and the
countries judicial system. Private interest groups are inclined to play a less formal
game in this sense. One prime example of this is the boycott campaign launched
against oil and gas company Shell by environmental organization Greenpeace in the
1995 Brent Spar affair (Van Schendelen, 2010). A second old technique is
encapsulation. For instance, stakeholders are made more dependent by giving them a
budget to operate with. Another way is to give them certain procedures to follow that
affect the decision-making. Van Schendelen (1998) states that this allows ministries
keep independent agencies and private organizations under control. Even the EU relies
on subsidy allocations to get things moving in a favorable direction. NGOs may also
use a part of its budget to make other parties more dependent on them.
Advocacy is a third well established technique. The most common way to explain this
is by simply labelling it as propaganda (Van Schendelen, 2010). This technique is
usually manifested through advertisement or via the media channels. This tactic is
frequently used by NGOs and trade organizations within the EU. The formal variant
of advocacy is litigation in court where self-interest is advocated by reference to the
laws (Stone Sweet & Caporaso, 1998). The fourth and final technique is
argumentation. Here is self-interest backed up by intellectual reasoning, based on logic
and empirically credible sources (Van Schendelen, 2010). However, the impact
depends on the reliability of the sources. One concrete example of this is yet again the
Brent Spar case where neither Shell nor Greenpeace maintained a credible position
(Van Schendelen, 2010). Shell neglected the logical alternative of dismantling the
platform and Greenpeace did not provide a correct estimation on the pollution levels
14

Robert Johansson
caused by the platform. Argumentation is frequently used when an issue goes public
or when the stakeholders are almost convinced according to Van Schendelen (2010).

2.5.1.1 Environmental organizations
In the early years of the environmental groups history, most active groups in the EU
very considered to be social movement groups (SMOs) rather than organizations. The
question is: have these groups always had organizational traits? Diani (1996) suggests
that the European environmental groups have been institutionalized since the 1970s.
A sign that supports Diani’s (1996) claims are the growing number of SMOs in the
EUs policy network. This could also be an effect of the ongoing changes in the
environmental

politics.

The

current

discussion

surrounding

environmental

organizations are often theoretically ambiguous according to Diani & Donati (1996).
Accurate reconstructions of the evolution of the specific movements or groups are not
always backed up with adequate information regarding the concept of SMOs. (Diani
& Donati, 1996). Diani (1999) mentions several different typologies of non-partisan
political organizations. Most organizations are shaped by their response to two
essential functional components. These are resource mobilization and political
efficacy. In order to survive, these organizations must secure both resources and
personnel. Both are necessary to survive and pursue the organizational goals according
to Diani and Donati (1996).
As stated by Lanzalaco (1990), meeting these different requirements is challenging for
any political organization, whether it is a party, social movement, or an interest group.
Diani (1999) states that environmental SMOs are usually faced with a choice between
two options. They may either try to mobilize the largest possible support from the
public or gather resources that are needed for the maintenance of a semi- or quasi
professional group. In short, the basic alternatives are between of mobilization
(activism) or resources (Oliver & Marwell, 1992). According to Oliver & Marwell
(1992), this has important effects on SMOs abilities to act on regular basis. Each option
requires different mobilization techniques and therefore, different organizational
models are required (Oliver & Marwell, 1992; Schwartz and Paul, 1992). SMOs
effectiveness as representatives of unvested interests may emerge out of either
disruption or through political negotiation. It is worth to mention that SMOs that fully
comply to the rules of the game may very well harm their own cause by compromising
their organizational integrity (Lowe and Goyder, 1983; Richardson & Watts, 1985;
15

Robert Johansson
Grant, 1989). Nonetheless, the standard description of a conventional interest group is
characterized by a professional staff and emphasize the use of traditional pressure
strategies. Diani & Donati (1999) states that the participatory protest organization
focuses mainly on participatory actions with subcultural structures, combined with a
strong inclination to use tactics such as disruptive protest or boycott campaigns. This
model fits the description of the decentralized grassroot SMO. Likewise, the
professional protest organization emphasizes the use of activists and the mobilization
of financial support, just like the public interest lobby (Diani & Donati, 1999). The
participatory pressure-group is in some ways similar to the participatory organization.
The members are involved in the organizational life but focus more on the
conventional form of lobbying. However, Diani & Donati (1999) claim that
environmental organizations have recently tilted more towards movement
institutionalization. In fact, many environmental groups have always been drawn to
public lobbies. In the past most organizations have preferred non-confrontational
styles of action rather than more militant actions that are often characterized by the
activist niched organizations.
It is also worth to mention that these organizations usually only turn issues into objects
of public controversy after discussions with policymakers have proved to be in vain
(Diani & Donati, 1999). Since the 1980s, time has proven that confrontational
strategies have been more effective compared to conventional forms of pressure.
Boycotting and protests have been skipped in favor for petitioning campaigns,
lobbying, production of books and infomercials according to Diani and Donati (1999).
This is executed for both public and commercial purposes (Donati, 1994). Similar
trends have been seen all over Europe. In the 1990s, environmental groups started
gaining access to formal policy bodies, this includes ministerial committees and
hearings (Dalton, 1994).
Donati (1994) states that in order for the environmental groups to be successful with
their actions, they require legitimation and respectability rather than displaying
disruptive means. This indicates that institution building is replacing the past of
confrontational politics. It could also possibly be the fact that confrontational means
have proven to be futile in many cases. Eder (1995) suggests that a transformation
from participatory to non-participatory structures have taken place within the
environmental groups. Although, most of these organizations central bodies consist of
campaign teams which share some basic resources such as press offices and legal
16

Robert Johansson
advice, they remain independent (Donati, 1994). However, this does not apply to
massive organizations like World Wildlife Foundation, or Greenpeace. These groups
have always been known as large bureaucratic organizations. In Greenpeace, different
local branches maintain an important role when it comes to responsibility like raising
funds. This is in fact the only time these local groups play a vital role. The reality is
that the organization is run professionally from its headquarters (Donati, 1994).
The majority of the European environmental groups are more dependent on new
sources of income other than public and corporate funding and membership fees
(Szerszinski, 1995). Assignments like campaign planning and coordination are
delegated to the professional staff. These are features that fits the description of the
professional protest organization (Diani & Donati, 1999). A natural example is
Greenpeace. Diani (1999) underlines that Greenpeace has never adopted a mass
participatory model but has always been fundamentally centralized and professional.
The reality is that these types of organizations are usually more dependent on material
resources rather than activism (Shaiko, 1993; Rucht, 1995). While Greenpeace often
engages in conventional lobbying it still has a strong inclination towards
confrontational strategies like many other activist-organizations (Diani & Donati
1999). However, these actions are not accomplished to mobilize sympathizers, but
rather to receive media coverage and to generate support and resources (Hansen,
1993). In addition to this, environmental NGOs are often fixated at single policy
decisions rather than general lobbying. According to Gullberg (2008, 166) general
lobbying is not only aimed at influencing a specific policy decision, but also future
decisions and the decision-makers’ views on the policy area. The question is if this
proclivity depends on the resource aspect yet again.

2.5.1.2 Business organizations
In the wake of globalization there has been much debate as to whether large firms have
become stateless multinationals out of national control (Kindleberger & Audretsch,
1981; Strange & Stopford 1991). Simultaneously, the question is whether they have
remained embedded in national public policy systems and cultural traditions (Ruigrok
& Van Tulder, 1995). According to Hirschman’s (1970), distinction in how firms can
express preferences via entry or exit from the market and the activities involving
communication and lobbying within the market, it has proven that the change in the
EU market has altered the lobbying behavior of the business sector. Coen (1998) states
17

Robert Johansson
that the institutional relationships with firms have evolved to fill the void created by
the weakening of the members states authority over trade and business.
This in turn means that large European firms have become major actors at the top level
of European politics. This further contributes to the follow up question regarding
nation state theories of business representation mentioned by (Streeck & Schimitter,
1991; Mazey & Richardson (1993). This new collaboration between the EU
institutions and the business sector is considered to be the emergence of transnational
pluralism, which was mentioned briefly in the beginning of this thesis. The theory
mixture between European corporativism and pluralism saturates the European public
policy system according to Coen (2007). Coen (2007) admits that past studies have
been insightful, but they examined the policy system in its time of evolutionary process
and while the political economy was in a state of flux. Subsequently, many studies
missed the establishment of formalized business lobbyism. This has given the birth to
the hypothesis that suggests that the European Commission has institutionalized its
bargaining position with business interests and by doing so, established a form of elite
pluralism in the union (Coen, 2007, 335). In short, this means that the firms have
established European credentials and political alliances in exchange for access to
important policy forums (Coen, 1997). Coen (2007) states that firms have recognized
the lack importance of reactive and destructive lobbying and have instead, directed
their resources towards pro-active strategies.
Fagan-Watson, Elliot and Watson (2015) claim that data reported by companies and
data collected by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), indicate that the business
sector use trade associations to influence climate policy. Around 61 percent of all
companies that responded to CDP, and 77 percent of the largest 500 companies in the
entire world, claim that they have used trade associations to lobby on climate policy
in the past (Fagan-Watson et al., 2015). Fagan-Watson et al. (2015), claim that trade
associations represent the interests of business, or individual industrial sectors. The
reality is that these associations act as an aggregator of opinions for the business sector.
In fact, policymakers are said to give greater weight to trade associations than to
individual companies. Partially, this is because the trade associations claim that they
represent tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs (Fagan-Watson et al., 2015).
Furthermore, these associations allow their members to utilize their knowledge and

18

Robert Johansson
contracts in policy arenas where they may lack the suffice expertise or resources to
lobby with success.
Trade associations serve as a forum for information sharing and discussion with trade
association members and other companies according to Fagan-Watson et al. (2015).
After conducting several interviews with members of trade associations, investors,
NGOs and a former assistant to a MEP, Fagan-Watson et al. (2015) found that trade
associations have substantial influence over climate policy. However, companies exert
influence through other venues as well. As stated by Fagan-Watson et al. (2015), 61
percent of all companies responding to CDP in 2014, state that they influence climate
policy indirectly through trade associations. Around a third of the respondents claim
they directly engage with policymakers. Only less than a fifth of the responders claim
to not influence policy processes related to climate change at all (Fagan-Watson et al.,
2015). These numbers are displayed in detail in the table presented down below.

Table 1 displays that a higher percentage of companies in the Global 500 (The largest
companies in the world) use trade associations to voice their opinions. Out of the whole
sample, this involves roughly 61 percent of all responding companies. If anything, this
indicates that the larger companies utilize trade associations to influence climate policy
(Fagan-Watson et al., 2015). However, it is estimated that the corporate involvement
in climate policy may well be greater than reported according to Fagan-Watson et al.
(2015). In addition to this, Gullberg (2008) found that the business sector focuses more
on general lobbying compared to environmental NGOs.

2.5.1.3 Balance of power and transparency
Coen (2007) states that interest groups are recognized but not always considered a
welcome actor in the western politics. However, the majority of political scientists are
convinced that public and private interests have an important role to play in the public
policy shaping process (Richardson, 2002). According to Coen (2007) is this nowhere
more apparent than in the European public policy, where around 1500 commission and
parliamentary officials interact with lobbyists on daily basis. The transfer of regulatory
functions from the sovereign member states to the EU institutions in areas such as
health and safety, employment, product quality, competition law and environmental
standards, contributed to the Europeanization of interest groups (Young & Wallace
2000; Mazey & Richardson, 2006). As a result of the increasing competencies in the
EU, interest groups and lobbying activities have sky-rocketed throughout 1990s
(Greenwood, 2002). By the end of 2012, around 5400 organizations had register in the
EU transparency register. Nearly 50 percent of the registered organizations consisted
of in-house lobbyists and business organizations, while only 28 percent were NGOs
(EU transparency register). Since then, the number of registrations has increased
significantly.

Robert Johansson
According to the EU transparency register (2021), the current number of registrations
lies at 12655 organizations. The majority of the organizations are unsurprisingly inhouse lobbyists and trade/business organizations. Out of the estimated 3400 NGOs in
the register, only a third focus on environmental issues (EU transparency register,
2021). The total number of interest groups in the EU is unclear, since interest group
registration is not mandatory. According to the ECs (2013) annual report, both NGOs
and public affairs consultancies among the respondents were in favor of mandatory
registration for all interest groups. The implementation of clear and enforceable rules
might minimize the possibility of having a selected number of resource-heavy interests
dominating the decision-making process. The next section will summarize the central
content of the theoretical framework as well as a specification of the research question.

2.6 Chapter summary
Lobbying is without a doubt both polarizing and hard to grasp. However, with the help
of the theoretical framework, it is possible to outline several key elements. The
concerns with the current state of the lobbying in the EU revolves around the lack of
transparency and the disparity in resources. However, the introduction of the
transparency register shows some promise. Moreover, grassroot movements and
environmental NGOs struggle with funding and tying connections to officials (Diani,
1999; Gullberg, 2008). Furthermore, the field of lobbying is not equally represented.
The business sector clearly outnumbers their competitors (Karr, 2007). Business
organizations are also more likely to unite and form coalitions (Coen, 2007; Van
Schendelen, 2010). The empirical findings suggest that the business organizations
focus a great deal on general lobbying. In contrast, environmental organizations tend
to focus on single policy issues. This is largely attributed to the lack of resources
according to Gullberg (2008). Past studies also indicate that organizations like
Greenpeace engage in both conventional lobbying and confrontational strategies (i.e.
boycotting, protesting, smearing campaigns) (Diani & Donati, 1999; Van Schendelen,
2010). However, it is worth to mention that this varies depending on the organization
type (i.e. participatory protest organization, professional protest organization,
grassroot SMO). Past research indicate that the Commission is the main focus for the
lobbyists. The reason behind is the fact that the Commission is the center of the
decision-making process. However, with the Parliaments increasing competencies, the

21

Robert Johansson
institution is now one of the most lobbied institutions in the EU. Although, interest
groups who engage in general lobbying tend to target all three institutions.
Furthermore, the theoretical framework indicates that interest groups generally can
choose between four primary lobbying techniques. These techniques are summarized
in the figure down below.

Van Schendelen’s (2010) traditional lobbying techniques displayed in the figure above
are frequently utilized by many different types of interest groups. Advocacy and
coercion are similar techniques and have been used by environmental organizations in
the past (Van Schendelen, 2010). Encapsulation is a technique that can be utilized to
control subsidiaries through limiting the resource distribution. For instance, this allows
ministries to keep agencies and private organizations under control. Van Schendelen
(2010) states that an NGO can use a part of its budget to make its peers more dependent
on them. Argumentation is expressed through reasoning, logic and by submitting
empirical data when negotiating. All these techniques are used in two central strategy
types (i.e. outside and inside). Outside strategies often involve visible strategies such
as media campaigns. Beyers (2008, 1197) claims that gaining visibility and increasing
salience is an important component of advocacy. In contrast, inside strategies involves
argumentation and bargaining with decision-makers. However, this strategy is usually
not visible to the public (Beyers, 2008).
22

Robert Johansson
This concludes the summary of the theoretical framework. The specified
research question is formulated following: Which strategies are utilized by businessand environmental NGOs when influencing climate policy in the EU? The upcoming
methodology chapter will discuss and compare different research designs, the data
gathering method and the overall expectations.

23

3. Methodology
The theoretical framework presented in the previous chapter indicate that there are
several factors that impact interest groups strategic choices. Hence, factors like
organization type, policy issue and financial budget is believed to impact the choice.
This chapter will cover the choice of methodology as well as the benefits and
disadvantages with various research designs. Further along in the chapter, the data
gathering process and the inclusion- and exclusion criteria will be presented. These
procedures will determine which articles that will be included in the systematic
literature study. The chosen studies will be compiled in a table further on in this
chapter. The aim is to try and distinguish the plausible differences in business- and
environmental organizations lobbying strategies. By utilizing the procedure of a
systematic literature review, the prospect is to examine a suitable sample to determine
if there are any notable differences between the two actors’ strategical repertoires when
influencing climate policy. Thus, the aim is to answer the following question: Which
strategies are utilized by business- and environmental NGOs when influencing climate
policy in the EU? In accordance with the inductive approach, the aim is to try and
distinguish the results from past empirical studies. This seems reasonable considering
the empirical observations that were presented in chapter 2. The following section will
cover the benefits and the limits with both the systematic literature review and the
traditional literature study.

3.1 Research designs
3.1.1 Literature study
This method is closely related to the systematic literature study. Therefore, it seems
only logical to cover some of the benefits and flaws with this method. According to
Soerensen (2004), there are several approaches that can be chosen when conducting a
literature study. Soerensen (2004) claims that a number of factors may have an impact
on the type of strategy that can be implemented. For instance, this determined by the
type of subject or the researcher’s knowledge of the subject. If the researcher has
previous experience in the field, a brief look at the latest journals might be sufficient.
However, if the researcher is entering uncharted territory, it is probably wise to do a
more thorough review of the literature (Soerensen, 2004). Furthermore, the purpose
and the aim of the study will have an impact on the time that is required to fulfill the
24

Robert Johansson
study, especially if the project includes a large number of studies, the process is likely
to be both challenging and time consuming. To accommodate these requirements,
Sorensen (2004) mentions several strategies that can be utilized.
For instance, the domain-based strategy has its starting point in a precise definition of
what is being reviewed. This type of research is often executed out by researchers that
are new in the field – or if the purpose is to produce an overview article classifying the
literature for future research (Soerensen, 2004). The definition of domain might consist
of a list of academic material, a keyword for e-database searches, news databases etc.
This is usually combined with a criterion on the date of publication. The date criterion
will be a result of a trial-and error process, based on the relevance and the number of
contributions identified by the researcher (Soerensen, 2004). The disadvantage with
this approach is the fact that the process is quite time-consuming and requires a
considerable degree of discipline during the analyzing process. However, this
procedure also provides several advantages. For instance, it allows the researcher to
backtrack the steps taken in the work process, hence, it is easier detect potential errors
done throughout the project (Forsberg & Wengström, 2010). The exception is in
instances where the references are online-based and are updated regularly and seldom
archived (Soerensen, 2004). Another useful approach is the trust-review strategy.
According to Sorensen (2004) is this strategy best utilized when reviewing a subject
area published by a trusted source, e.g. a highly ranked journal (Soerensen, 2004). The
benefit of working within an established and charted field of research, is the possibility
to find reviewed articles describing and classifying the contributions discovered in past
studies. The trusted review strategy is a new procedure and the classification fit the
purpose of the research in most cases, it will simply require the researcher to update
the existing body of knowledge (Soerensen, 2004). Forsberg and Wengström (2010)
claim that it is often wise to include more journals in the sample, as it may help the
researcher to include and cover other categories in the study. Even if all the categories
are in conflict with the intended framework, the literature study from a trusted source
represents a time-saver in terms of having identified the contributions (Soerensen,
2004).
The last strategy mentioned by Soerensen (2004) is the snow-balling strategy. This
procedure provides the least structured result, thereby delivering the least valid result
out of the three strategies presented in this subchapter. The procedure starts with the
25

Robert Johansson
identification of at least one article of relevance, and then reading the sources
referenced. There is a possibility that this “backtracking” either provide a clearer
picture of the subject or perhaps in terms of keywords. The next step is to perform a
keyword search in e-databases or in relevant the journals according to Soerensen
(2004). There is also a benefit with using various internet-enabled tools. This might
include using citation-based search options, personal homepages for the latest
contributions or other features.
Soerensen (2004) states that there is always a possibility that the “trusted-source” study
is not possible to fulfill without utilizing certain elements from the snow-balling
strategy. For instance, the source might be outdated, or it could simply be the fact that
the source does not cover the theme of the study. The procedure revolving the domainbased strategy is rather strict, which makes it in some cases unrealistic to complete.
(Soerensen, 2004). Therefore, is the domain-based strategy more suitable for selected
journals, while the snow-balling strategy suits other types of sources. However, there
is always a possibility to combine strategies. Although, this is accompanied with risks
on its own according to Soerensen (2004). Combining strategies could in fact confuse
the requirements needed for the literature study, and thereby endanger the credibility
of the study. Therefore, it is deemed wise to separately report for each sub-study in the
discussion, in order to minimize the chance of any misunderstandings (Soerensen,
2004). Out of these three presented strategies, the domain-based strategy seems to have
the most sensible characteristics. However, Soerensen (2004) claims that the choice of
strategy will have certain dependencies to the epistemological stance in the research
initiative. In general, the strategy provides the ability to give firm statements about the
phenomenon or object that is being examined. (Soerensen, 2004).

3.1.2 Systematic literature study
This segment will cover the fundamentals of the systematic literature study. As stated
by Bryman (2018), the purpose of a systematic literature study to provide an overview
of the scientific data in a specific domain. Furthermore, it is also necessary to explain
under which circumstances it is possible apply this method. A reasonable prerequisite
to keep in mind when conducting a systematic literature study, is to guarantee that
there is a sufficient quantity of studies available that maintain a good scientific
standard, otherwise it is impossible to make any assessments or to draw any
conclusions from the material (Forsberg & Wengström, 2010). Mulrow and Oxman
26

Robert Johansson
(1997) define a systematic literature study as a process that is based on a clearly
phrased question that is answered systematically through identifying, choosing, and
evaluating relevant research. The differences between a regular literature study with a
systematic study, according to Cullum (1999) is the search process, the critical
evaluation and the analysis of the findings. The characterization of a systematic
literature study is first and foremost the attempt to identify all the relevant research
within the field that is being examined. This includes both published and unpublished
material. Secondly, a systematic evaluation of every study’s validity is done. The last
step is to use statistic methods to analyze the result from similar studies, and to carry
out a meta-analysis (Cullum, 1999). Hearn et al. (1999) claim that a systematic
literature study should include a clearly formulated research question, a search strategy
and inclusion- and exclusion criteria. Lastly, all the central elements and findings of
the study should be presented and discussed throughout the thesis. Generally, this
method is often utilized in medicine studies. However, it can also be applied in other
disciplines according to Forsberg and Wengström (2010). For this reason, the
procedures involved in a systematic literature study appears to be a suitable choice for
this thesis.

3.2 Data and systematics
This section will provide insight in the work process and all the steps taken in the data
gathering process as well as the reasoning behind all the decisions. The prospect is to
gather a sample of articles that have covered similar aspects of lobbying. The inclusion
and exclusion criteria will be discussed later on in the chapter. The emphasis will be
on studies covering business- and environmental NGOs lobbying strategies related to
climate policy.

3.2.1 Databases
The data will be extracted from both Google Scholar and Ebsco. These choices are
justified by the fact that Google scholar tend to provide a large variety of studies while
Ebsco grants access to peer reviewed articles. The presumption is that two databases
will be enough for this thesis.

3.2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
This procedure is necessary in order to determine that the selected articles are relevant.
The focal point is on lobbying targeting lobbying and climate policy the in EU.
27

Robert Johansson
Therefore, any articles covering lobbying in the USA will be avoided. Another reason
is the fact that the lobbying traditions is very different in USA. The biggest difference
is probably the fact that the majority of the policymakers in EU institutions are not
elected. This means that they do not stand for elections, thus they do need to find
money to fund their campaigns (Mahoney, 2008). Therefore, the main focus will be
limited to studies that cover the European Union or global events. Another important
procedure is the quality assessment of all the literature. Only peer-review studies will
be included in the final sample of studies. Non-scientific literature will be excluded.
The level of relevance will be initially based on the articles title and abstract.
Thenceforth, the rest of the contents will be evaluated.
The search terms and results will be presented in a matrix presented below. The
selection of studies is based on three key steps:
1. Title relevance – first glance at the title should determine if the study is
relevant.
2. Abstract relevance – the same procedure as with the previous step.
3. Body text relevance – this is the last step that confirms the relevance of the
study.

3.3 Operationalization
Every study requires the operationalization of the theoretical definitions. This process
provides the link to between theoretical hypotheses and the mechanism to examine the
predictions. Furthermore, this procedure has a crucial impact on the validity of the
results (Essaiasson, 2012). It is important to point out, that the manner in which the
operationalization is conducted might shape the results of the study. Therefore, it is
crucial to motivate the reasons behind the design of the operationalization.
Subsequently, it also needed to acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of both the
data sample and the operationalizations.
As mentioned previously, the inductive approach of the thesis indicates that the aim is
to try and derive from past studies whether inside- or outside strategies are used when
lobbying salient issues like climate policy. According to Bernhard (2011, 7), inductive
research involves the search for patterns from observation and the development of
explanations – theories – for those patterns through series of hypotheses. The
inductive reasoning is often referred to as a “bottom-up” strategy. This means that the
researcher uses observations to describe a picture of the phenomenon that is being
examined (Lodico et al., 2010). The primary hypothesis of the thesis is based on the
assumption that outside strategies are more frequently used by environmental
organizations, while business organizations prioritize inside strategies when lobbying.
Past studies have indicated that environmental organizations and activists are indeed
prone to use outside strategies (Diani, 1999; Beyers, 2008). However, there is also a
possibility that both business- and environmental organizations use a combination of
strategies when lobbying salient issues like climate policy. Although, the inductive
29

Robert Johansson
approach seems reasonable in this case when the aim to depict the differences in
lobbying strategies, it is worth to mention there are obvious risks with this method. As
a matter of fact, the inductive process will not necessarily prove anything if the
observations are incorrect. Hence, the greatest disadvantage is the risk of not being
able to generalize the results from the overview of studies. However, this risk occurs
also in other methods. Fortunately, the systematic literature review tends to provide a
clear and comprehensive overview of the examined topic if performed correctly.
Therefore, the estimation is that the benefits outweigh the risk in this case and that they
will not jeopardize the internal validity of the thesis. The selection of articles will be
completed through using different search terms in both Google Scholar and Ebsco.
The search terms will include various combinations of relevant key words. The
conceived words will be inside and outside lobbying, lobbying strategies, interest
group, climate policy and EU. This will be discussed further in chapter 4. Next chapter
will summarize the entire methodology chapter.

3.4 Chapter summary
Throughout this chapter, various research designs and their benefits and disadvantages
have been discussed. This process is essential when answering a research question.
The literature study shares many similar features with the systematic literature review.
However, the principals of the systematic literature overview are beneficial when
dealing with multiple studies. The aim is to select between 5 and 10 articles to answer
the research question. The studies will be retrieved from Google Scholar and Ebsco
with the help of the search terms presented in chapter 3.3. The lack of established
theories in regard to lobbying strategies makes the inductive approach suitable in this
case. This concludes the summary of the methodology chapter. Next chapter includes
the search term process and the summary of the chosen studies.

Examination of whether

Inside

is

through

does not generate much

of press releases, social

advertising,
protests.

this democratic

foster relationships
with both
policymakers and
publics by engaging in
inside and outside

NGOs choice of lobbying
strategies depends on

factors. The goals will
also reflect the usage of
strategies.

Dur, M., & Mateo, G.,
(2013) Gaining access
or
going
public?
Interest
group
strategies
in
five
European countries

Interest groups differ in
the strategies they use
to influence public
policy. Some mainly try
to gain access (i.e., have
direct contact with
decision makers),
whereas others tend
to ‘go public’ by
launching campaigns
that aim to mobilize the
broader public.

What explains this
variety in the choice of
tactics and, in turn, the
strategies of the different
groups to influence
public policy?

The study
argues
that
a
significant
relationship between the actions
(or strategies) of interest groups
and their success, for which we can
reasonably presume a causal link,
is an indication of influence.
Combining strategies and success
can therefore unravel pathways of
interest group influence. This
paper demonstrates that interest
group influence is more likely
when group strategies unfold in a
favorable context.
The support base has no real effect
on an NGO’s inside or outside
lobbying. However, NGOs are
more likely to engage in inside
lobbying on policy issues with a
beneficiary scope. Inside lobbying
seems to be prone to attract special
interests rather than public good
issues. Less complex issues
usually involve outside lobbying.
The forces driving outside
lobbying seem to be based on
reputation. Inside lobbying is more
puzzling.
The result indicates that NGOs
utilize both inside and outside
strategies when lobbying at a
global level. The choice of strategy
is determined by the goals,
membership, contributions and
lastly access.
The most common denominator
for an interest groups choice of
strategy is group type. Regardless,
if it is composed of firms,
professional members or acts on a
behalf of a large number of
individuals. This is however
conditional
on
a
group’s
endowment
with
material
resources and the issue context is
also crucial.

Vesa, J., et al., (2020) The
quiet opposition: How the
pro-economy
lobby
influences climate policy

The
pro-economy
lobby influences the
policy process using
strategies such as
inside lobbying and by
avoiding
public
statements.

Classifying
interest
groups and dividing
them into sub-categories
is problematic. In spite
of this, the literature
suggests that group type
is
an
important
determinant
of
organizations lobbying
behavior. Can the same
thing be said about the
institutional
framework?
The
research
on
influence
usually
hypothesizes
that
diffuse interests or
NGOs are, comparted to
their
business
counterparts,
more
likely to practice outside
strategies.
Although
this if often true,
researchers still observe
a large number of
business
interests
pursuing
outside
strategies as well.
Business organizations
lobby on too many
single policy decisions.
Environmental
organizations are unable
to do this because of
tight budget constraints.
The results indicate that
studies
on
climate
policy should focus
more on strategies
involving
media
spotlight

Outside lobbying might not be the
most effective way in attaining
policy influence, however it can
still serve as a useful strategy to
address resource needs. The
analysis also demonstrates that the
effect of group type on the choice
of lobbying strategies depends on
the resources organized interests
have at their disposal. There is
also a clear connection between
the choice of strategy, group type,
policy issue and the resource
aspect.
The results demonstrates that
settings where direct democratic
instruments are easily attainable,
as in Switzerland, groups are
better integrated into the policy
making process and therefore use
a mix of lobbying strategies. In the
Germany their counterparts rely
heavily on outside strategies
seeking influence via the media or
the public. In both countries there
is a pronounced difference in how
interest groups behave.
The study illustrates the positives
of an approach of based on
organization
theory
which
considers natures of political
conflicts
and
organizational
format as key dimensions. This
may explain some of the variance
in the choice of different lobbying
strategies.

Both single-issue lobbying and
general lobbying can provide
long-term effects.

The business sector managed to be
successful in their climate policy
mitigation despite the lack of
media presence.

Robert Johansson
The initial keyword searches gave a huge number of hits. However, after reviewing
the results, it was quickly apparent that a great portion of the articles had very little
relevance to theme of this thesis. Therefore, the search terms had to be narrowed. It is
also worth mentioning that only academic articles were chosen. Simultaneously, no
studies covering lobbying in the United States were included in the final sample. The
majority of the studies covered lobbying specifically in the EU. However, the
exception were three studies, one of them covered lobbying strategies at global
conferences and the remaining two compared domestic lobbying in several European
countries. The rest of the results will be presented in detail in the upcoming
subchapters.

4.3 International and domestic lobbying
Hanegraaff, Beyers and De Bruycker (2016) claim that the case of the nuclear energy
trade association FORATOM and Greenpeace demonstrates two different advocacy
strategies. The first being outside lobbying, which is utilized by Greenpeace. This
strategy includes tactics that more or less address policymakers through raising
awareness among the general public. The use of public communication channels is
prioritized over direct exchanges with the policymakers. The strategy may also involve
public campaigns and protest demonstrations. In contrast, the trade association
FORATOM used a different approach to influence the policymakers. Inside lobbying
involves direct exchanges with policymakers through private communication. This
includes meetings, email exchanges and telephone calls. This type of lobbying is
usually not visible to the general public (Hanegraaff et al. 2016). In academic circles,
inside lobbying is usually explained through an information-based exchange
perspective. This ultimately means that interest groups exchange relevant information
with policymakers, and in return they hopefully achieve the expected policy outcome.
Outside lobbying relies on asserting pressure on policymakers through drawing
support from a larger audience of stakeholders. The risk of not complying can lead to
electoral damage according to De Bruycker and Iskander (2018).
Hanegraaff et al. (2016) state that combining strategies and success can unravel new
pathways of interest group influences. The study also indicates that interest group
influence is more likely when group strategies unfold in a favorable context. The
analysis indicates that the differences between business interests and NGOs in how
they balance between inside and outside are less pronounced than presumed. However,
34

Robert Johansson
Hanegraaff et al. (2016, 18) state that contextual conditions, group type and resource
dependencies are all variables that affect the choice of strategy. In addition, Dellmuth
and Tallberg (2017) also confirm that NGOs have mobilized to influence
policymaking through the International Organizations (IOs). The results suggest that
there are in fact similarities in lobbying both the international and domestic arena. The
NGOs employ an inside strategy by providing information and communicating with
stakeholders and IO representatives. At the same time, they use an outside strategy,
amassing political leverage through the news and social media (Dellmuth & Tallberg,
2017). In short, NGOs tend to combine the strategies that best favor their interests.
Dellmuth and Tallberg (2017) conclude that this pattern holds beyond the United
Nations (UN) as well. It is also clear that NGOs choice of lobbying strategy is
influenced by a combination of three specific factors. These factors also tend to shape
the domestic interest groups. The first factor is the goals of the NGO. Dellmuth and
Tallberg (2017, 15) argue that the stronger the NGOs’ ambition to influence UN
policymaking, the more they rely on inside lobbying. This logic seems to apply to
NGOs that are not membership organizations. This is explained by the fact that, NGOs
that are dependent on membership contributions must focus on the dual objectives of
gaining influence and securing the organizations survival (Dellmuth & Tallberg,
2017). Consequently, this might weaken the link between goals and strategies. The
third and final factor is the access to decision-makers. NGOs who consider themselves
privileged in this regard tend to opt for an inside strategy according to Dellmuth and
Tallberg (2017). The study also pinpoints an important difference between NGOs in
global governance and interest groups that operate only at the domestic level. The
international NGOs resource situation does not influence its choice of lobbying
strategy in the UN. Dellmuth and Tallberg (2017, 15) found that the importance of
resources for lobbying is dependent on the political context, however, this may not
apply to all the interest groups operating in the EU.

4.4 Lobbying behavior in European countries.
Dur and Mateo (2013) examined the lobbying behavior of interest groups in five
different European countries, Austria, Ireland, Germany, Latvia and Spain. The
assumption was that outside strategies require huge amounts of resources from the
interest groups, while some forms of inside strategies are relatively cheap in
comparison. Dur and Mateo (2017) expected to see the resource- rich groups to be
35

Robert Johansson
more likely to utilize inside lobbying strategies compared to the organizations that lack
resources. Business organizations were expected to employ any additional resources
to strengthen their inside strategy. Meanwhile, the citizen groups and other
professional associations would use the resources to engage in outside lobbying, which
would ultimately aid them in maintaining their base of supporters or members (Dur &
Mateo, 2013). The data from Mateo and Dur’s (2013) study suggest that the distinction
between business- and professional associations and citizen group explains a large part
of the variation across groups when it comes choosing strategy. It is worth to mention
that the effect of group type is dependent on the group resources and yet again the
issue at hand. The biggest differences are found among the resource rich associations
that are lobbying for distributive policies according to Dur and Mateo (2013). Another
interesting finding is that the data suggest that the differences across the European
countries in lobbying strategies are minor, compared to the other variables used in the
study. Professional associations and citizen groups seem more inclined towards
adopting an outside strategy compared to their business counterparts. This does not
seem to change even for the groups that have considerable amounts of resources. Dur
and Mateo (2013) state that institutional reforms that promote access to decisionmakers will ultimately benefit business organizations over other NGOs. Dur and
Mateo (2013) also conclude that the findings suggest that while the variation across
the group types is substantial, they still have clear leeway in their choice of strategy.
Therefore, Dur and Mateo (2013) emphasize the need of including studies of interest
group influence when examining interest group strategies. The question is if lobbying
for a specific issue is interdependent. Dur and Mateo (2013) underline that is it is likely
that groups select strategies in response to the strategies that previous groups have
utilized in similar positions.

4.5 Institutional settings
Weiler and Brändli (2015) sought to determine whether the institutional framework of
the country in which the interest groups operate may or may not influence their choice
of lobbying strategy. According to Weiler and Brändli (2016) settings where direct
democratic instruments are present, like in Switzerland, cause-groups (representing
diffuse interests of the wider population) are well integrated into the policy-making
process. This in turn means that these groups utilize a balanced mix of lobbying
strategies. The results also indicate that the German counterparts tend to rely on outside
36

Robert Johansson
strategies. However, this does not apply to the other specific interest groups
(representing a subsection of society).
The data suggests that Swiss interest groups rely just as heavily on inside lobbying
strategies as their German rivals. Weidler and Brändli (2016) find that the effect of
direct democracy on lobbying strategies is mainly driven by cause groups in the policymaking process. The same behavior is not found among the specific interest groups.
However, there are only minor behavioral differences between the cause groups and
specific interest groups in the two countries. The lack of direct democratic means to
call a referendum is the main reason behind why the German cause group have to
pressure policy makers through the media and by rallying support from the general
public. The fact is that Switzerland stands out because of its direct democratic
instruments, therefore the generalizability of the results is limited. Future studies
should therefore examine whether these findings can be applied in other countries and
with different levels of direct democracy.

4.6 Inside and outside arenas
Beyers (2008) contribution assesses a topic that is overlooked by a great portion of the
scholars examining group politics. The study examines how the nature of policy issues
affect how interest groups operate and shape their strategies. According to Beyers
(2008), interest groups tend to emphasize semi-institutionalized strategies of inside
lobbying and urge the necessity of expertise. Scholars that examine social movements
tend to focus on the conflictual nature of politics. Political cleavages are used as the
main premiss of their analyzes. Although, these approaches might differ, they still
paint EU politics as both de-politicized and technocratic according to Beyers (2008).
The choice interest groups must make, is the type of arena they decide to present their
policy stance. These are either inside or outside arenas. The first arena consists of the
world of advisory bodies, agencies and parliamentary committees. A world that is for
the most part not visible to the EU constituents. While outside arena equals the
communication between other interest groups, citizens and policymakers through
visible channels. The goal with this strategy is to draw attention from a broader
audience to assert pressure on the policymakers. Beyers (2008) state that it is a
common assumption to believe that NGOs differ from business organizations because
of their principled beliefs and lack of resources. In contrast, business organizations are
considered to be well resourced and connected. The problem with these distinctions is
37

Robert Johansson
the fact that it does not illustrate the possible similarities shared by the different interest
groups. Beyers (2008) states that it would be more yielding to study interest groups
from one generic conceptual framework, as it is nearly impossible to design specific
theories that fit each group type. Beyers (2008) points out that organizations with
similar views still may adopt different strategies. In spite of this, organizations with
very different views (e.g. economic interests versus environmental NGOs) in some
cases may also adopt the similar strategies. This in turn may be a result of comparable
organizational formats or by other relevant factors. In fact, the choice of strategy
cannot be explained only by determining the organizational goals. According to Beyers
(2008), it is also necessary to include the issue-specific nature of the strategies and the
position that the actors maintain. Furthermore, Beyers (2008) found that NGOs are
more prone to challenge the status quo. However, this is does not necessary apply to
all policy issues. Beyers (2008, 1206) state that: It is the nature of policy issues in
combination with policy position and organizational format the affect an
organization’s political strategy, and not necessarily the a priori categorization of
organizations.

4.7 Policy issue factors
Both Beyers (2008) and Junk (2015) emphasize the importance of including policy
issues as a second wave of explanatory factors in interest group literature. Beyers
(2008, 1190) states that studying variation in issue characteristics is important for
understanding the micro-logics of interest group behavior. Interestingly enough, Junk
(2015) found that the organizational-level factor on NGO behavior, had very limited
explanatory power for the usage of outside and inside lobbying. However, the issuelevel factors facilitated better understanding. However, Junk (2015, 15) points out that
the findings cannot be uncritically generalized to all types of lobbying, policy sectors
or to NGOs from all member states. Despite this, the results indicate that resourceful
NGOs are favored when it comes to addressing the public through news and media
channels. Overall, the more resourceful NGOs seems to have bigger chances of playing
an intermediary role between the policymakers and the civil society (Junk, 2015, 16).
This is not necessarily because of their links to the policymakers, rather it is because
of their close ties to the public discussion according to Junk (2015). Beyond this, the
results prove that policy issues with certainty have implications on the lobbying
38

Robert Johansson
behavior of NGOs. Subsequently, less complex and more salient issues have higher
odds of NGO outside lobbying. According to Junk (2015) is this proof that reputation
is driving factor behind outside lobbying. In contrast, inside lobbying is considered to
be more complex. No underlying factors were identified. However, there is some
support to the claim that inside lobbying offers NGOs a venue to lobby less popular
issues. Inside lobbying is usually utilized when the policy issue has a clear beneficiary
scope according to Junk (2015). Furthermore, inside lobbying is definitely more prone
to attracting special interests rather than public good issues (Junk, 2015). Gullberg
(2008, 169) found that large business firms such as UNICE engage in general lobbying
when influencing both climate policy and other fields. In contrast, environmental
organization CAN Europe prioritize selected matters rather than general lobbying.
According to Gullberg (2008), the main difference between business- and
environmental organizations is not found in their implementation of outside- and
inside strategies, rather at the scale in which they lobby decision-makers. Gullberg
(2008, 175) also states that the main reason behind this difference is the fact that many
environmental organizations labor under tight budget constraints. Vesa, Gronow and
Ylä-Anttila (2020) found that the different lobbying strategies may be effective in
opposing climate policy. Vesa et al. (2020, 9) state that selected economic interest
groups collaborate closely with key ministries in Finland and can therefore influence
policy through inside lobbying without the need to seek media attention or attacking
climate science. These differences in strategy are based in the differences in
institutions. Vesa et al. (2020, 9) state that:
In countries characterized by a competitive, pluralist interest group system and the existence
of strong conservative media outlets, such as the United States, economic interest groups
have the incentive to use the media to oppose unwanted policy proposals. In contrast, in
Finland’s corporatist system, a small number of key organizations that represent economic
interests collaborate with like-minded ministries and enjoy an institutionalized position in
policy making, which gives them leeway to influence climate policy through inside
strategies.

These patterns are expected to be found in other European countries as well,
particularly in countries where corporatism coexists with unambitious climate policies
such as, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. However, more studies need to be
conducted before this can be established (Vesa et al., 2016).

39

Robert Johansson

4.8 Chapter summary
The results illustrate that the implementation of outside and inside strategies varies
considerably between business- and environmental organizations. The central factors
are the organizational aim, group type, access, budget, institutional setting and also
the type of policy issue (Hanegraaff, et al., 2016; Junk, 2015; Vesa, et al., 2020).
Hanegraaff et al. (2016) found that the political context, group type, and resource
situation shape the choice of strategy. Dellmuth and Tallberg (2017) state that this also
applies to lobbying outside the EU. Furthermore, the organizational goal may in some
cases impact the choice of strategy. Beyers (2008) claims that NGOs are more prone
to challenge the status quo. However, this does not necessarily mean that it can be
applied to all NGOs. Dellmuth and Tallberg (2017) found that gaining influence and
organizational survival work hand in hand. Throughout the theoretical framework, the
need for access was also considered a crucial for all interest groups (Van Schendelen,
2010). This is also confirmed by Dellmuth and Tallberg (2017).
Another important factor is the institutional setting where the lobbying activity takes
place. Weiler and Brändli (2016) state that interest groups generally thrive in settings
where direct democratic instruments are present. The results indicated that German
cause groups were more likely to use outside strategies compared to their Swiss
counterparts. Interestingly enough, the specific interest groups had very little
differences between the two countries. Weiler and Brändli (2016) claim that the main
reason why German cause groups used outside strategies more than the Swiss groups
comes down to the fact that Germans cannot rely on referendums like in Switzerland.
This also the reason why the possibility to generalize the results are limited. The
resource dependency or the budget impacts the lobbying possibilities for the majority
of the NGOs. According to Gullberg (2008) this is the main difference between
environmental- and business organizations. Greenwood (2002) claims that the
environmental organization’s lack of resources is exaggerated. However, the majority
of scholars argue that the business sector has immense resources compared to the
environmental lobbyists (Coen, 2007; Mazey & Richardson, 2002; Gullberg, 2008).
As stated previously, the type of policy issue shapes also the choice of strategy among
NGOs. In fact, less complex and more salient issues are usually influenced by outside
strategies (Junk, 2015). Inside lobbying is considered to more complex, and it requires
40

Robert Johansson
well-established links to the decision-makers. Junk (2015) found that NGOs have a
tendency to use inside lobbying when influencing less popular issues. Inside lobbying
is often associated with special interests rather than public good issues (Junk, 2015).
In addition to these factors, it is also possible that the media plays a significant role
when it comes to choosing strategies. Vesa et al. (2020) state that the lack of
conservative mainstream media in several European countries may be the reason why
the pro-economy lobbyists bypass the media. Subsequently, it is possible that both the
media and political system incentivizes NGOs to prefer inside lobbying (Vesa et al.,
2020). This concludes the summary of the results. The upcoming section includes a
summary of the theoretical framework and the answering of the research question.

5. Discussion and conclusions
The chapter includes a summary of the central contents of the thesis and a general
discussion regarding the research question and the results. The thesis is concluded with
a section covering the limitations, future prospects and a Swedish summary.

5.1 Summary
The growth of interest groups has led to stricter regulation of lobbying in the EU. The
bond between bureaucracies and interests have also raised questions on its own. It is
established that the EU institutions does not possess the relevant expertise and
resources that is needed in the policy-making process. Therefore, the decision-makers
have to rely on interest groups to fill the gap. This is considered a natural part of the
pluralistic democracy. However, the EU patterns of interest intermediation appears to
lean towards elite pluralism (Coen, 1997). The fact is that the Commission uphold
more contacts with business associations than with environmental organizations,
consumer groups and trade unions (Hooghe & Marks, 2001). This touches upon the
purpose of this thesis. The aim was to try and settle whether the current lobbying
landscape is catered towards the business sector. The specified research question is
Which strategies are the business- and environmental NGOs utilizing when
influencing climate policy in the EU?
The empirical findings indicate that business organizations focus on general lobbying
on all policy issues (Gullberg, 2008). Environmental organizations are more prone to
lobby on single policy issues. According to Gullberg (2008), this difference is largely
attributed to the lack of resources. Moreover, professional protest organizations like
Greenpeace utilize both conventional- and confrontational strategies. The results
indicate that organizational type and the aim with lobbying may impact the choice of
strategy. Both business- and environmental organizations main lobby target is the EC.
Although, lobbyists target the EP to a greater extent than previously. However, interest
groups who engage in general lobbying tend to target all three institutions in the EU.
The two main strategy types are outside- and inside strategies (Beyers, 2008). Outside
strategies is characterized by visible techniques such as media campaigns. In contrast,
inside strategies involves negotiation techniques outside the view of the public.

After careful consideration, the systematic literature review was chosen as the research
design. The systematic literature review provides a clear and comprehensive overview
of a research topic. This is beneficial when dealing with multiple studies. The inductive
reasoning will be utilized to draw conclusions from the chosen studies. The data is
collected with the help of several inclusion- and exclusion criteria and search terms.
The searches were performed in Google Scholar and Ebsco. The results extracted from
the chosen studies indicate that the implementation of outside and inside strategies
varies considerably between business- and environmental organizations. As mentioned
previously, organizational aim, group type, budget, institutional setting and policy
issues impacts the choice of strategy (Hanegraaff et al., 2016; Junk, 2015; Vesa et al.,
2020). Access is also considered a prerequisite to succeed (Van Schendelen, 2010;
Dellmuth & Tallberg, 2017). Next section includes a discussion of the results and the
answering of the research question.

5.2 Discussion
The results from the systematic literature review outline several key factors that impact
the choice of lobbying strategy among NGOs. This provides a complicated answer to
the research question. The fact is that both environmental- and business organizations
utilize a combination of inside- and outside strategies. The political context and
resource availability are considered to have huge impact on the implementation of
strategy. It is also worth to mention that this does not only apply to the EU (Dellmuth
& Tallberg, 2017). Junk (2015, p. 16), highlight that less complex and salient issues
are significantly more likely to be targeted by outside lobbying. Although
environmental policies tend to benefit the public, some issues might only benefit a
small fraction of society (Junk, 2015). Consequently, inside lobbying is useful when
NGOs lobby less popular and special interests. Furthermore, inside lobbying is favored
on policy issues with a specific beneficiary scope (Junk, 2015, p. 16-17). This is yet
again dependent on institutional access. From a democratic perspective, it might be
concerning that public good issues are seldom expressed through inside lobbying. The
fact is that special interests are closely linked with inside lobbying according to Junk
(2015).

43

In addition to this, it is highly likely that the media impacts this tendency. As stated
previously, the lack of conservative media outlets may be a reason why business
lobbyists disregard the media. For this reason, it is conceivable that certain media and
political systems incentivizes inside lobbying (Vesa et al., 2020).
Furthermore, the results clearly support the claim that variation in lobbying
strategies is dependent on the issue context. Junk (2015, 16) claims that the issue
context is pivotal. This is likely combined with the resource dependencies that NGOs
are faced with (Hanegraaff et al., 2016). Despite this, Hanegraaff et al. (2016, 18) claim
that depending on resource endowment and the competition for resources, the
difference between business interests and NGOs in how they balance between inside
and outside lobbying are less pronounced than often presumed. De Bruycker and
Beyers (2018) emphasize that the policy context mediates whether inside or outside
lobbying is considered more useful. In fact, De Bruycker and Beyers (2018, 30) state
that:
Outside lobbying results in more success (compared to inside lobbying) when defending a
position that gains broad approval in the public sphere. When advocating positions that lack
broad approval in media debates, in contrast, lobbyists can increase success if they primarily
rely on inside lobbying (but decrease success when engaging more often in outside lobbying).

This indicates that there is a clear link between the strategies of interest groups and
their success according to De Bruycker and Beyers (2018). In addition to this,
Hanegraaff et al. (2016, 18) claim that the resource competition is a notable predictor
for the use of outside lobbying. Subsequently, this means that interest groups take
organizational goals into consideration when choosing strategies. Overall, the studies
provided mixed descriptions. However, it is clear that both business and environmental
organizations use inside and outside strategies.

5.3 Limitations
One of the most notable flaws with the thesis is the limited quantity of studies covering
lobbying in the context of climate policy. In addition, only 9 studies were included in
the final sample. A more comprehensive sample of studies would have been
beneficiary. This could have been achieved by using more than two databases.
Therefore, the generalizability of the results is limited. In general, there are many
research questions of qualitative nature that are considered ill-fitted for a systematic
44

Robert Johansson
literature review. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to define the examined interest
groups in a more exact manner since so many different variations exist. Another option
would be to look at two specific organizations and examine how they balance their use
of strategies. A case study would without question have its benefits. Furthermore,
based on the results, future research should focus on other motives beyond the resource
dependency when explaining the differences in how NGOs balance outside and inside
lobbying strategies.

5.4 Final remarks
The importance of climate policy in the decision-making process has increased
significantly the past year. The decision-makers have no doubt a hard time pleasing all
the concerned parties. Nonetheless, a complex policy issue like climate policy is a
great example, why the EU decision-making process need to have a healthy and wellbalanced cooperation with the different interest groups operating within the EU.
Despite the lack of ability to generalize the results, these findings may help
understanding the larger picture of collective practices used by interest groups.
Nonetheless, future research should thenceforth focus on including multiple issues to
avoid having single issues dictate the results. The broader question is also how can
power and influence be evenly distributed in a functional and fair pluralistic
democracy?

6.Summary in Swedish
Titeln på avhandlingen är Intressegruppers lobbyingpåverkan – En studie om
intressegruppers användning av lobbyingstrategier inom EU. Beslutsfattandet inom
EU är på många sätt en invecklad process som i många fall kritiseras för att vara icke
representativt och saknar insyn. Pluralism anses vara en naturlig del av den
västerländska demokratin där flera olika parter är delaktiga i den politiska processen.
Därför anses lobbying vara en naturlig del av policyprocessen inom EU (Van
Schendelen, 2010). Utvecklingen under de senaste årtiondena har fått flera forskare att
ifrågasätta huruvida vissa intressegrupper har bättre förutsättningar jämfört med andra
intressegrupper. Är det en fråga om enbart tillvägagångsätt eller är det så att systemet
tillgodoser endast vissa grupperingar? Detta skulle i sådana fall innebära att
lobbyingen orsakar ett demokratiunderskott i EU (Coen, 1997). Avhandlingens syfte
är att undersöka ifall det är rimligt att påstå att EU och dess institutioner favoriserar
samarbetet

med

business-

och

industrivärldens

intresseorganisationer.

Frågeställningen är: Finns det skillnader eller likheter i hur business- och
miljöintressegrupperna väljer strategier när de försöker påverka klimatpolitiken i
EU?
Kan det vara enbart så att företagens intresseorganisationer har en mera mångsidig
repertoar när det kommer till att påverka beslutsfattare? Gynnas de p.g.a. sin
resursöverlägsenhet,

eller

är

lobbyinglandskapet

designat

för

att

passa

företagsvärldens behov? Denna syn delas av Broscheid och Coen (1997). För att
granska både företags- och miljöorganisationernas olika strategier valdes
klimatpolitiken som ett passande område att undersöka. Dessa organisationer är båda
aktivt engagerade i frågor som gäller miljö och klimatet inom EU. Klimatpolitiken är
både aktuell och numera en viktig del av politiken inom EU. I metodkapitlet diskuteras
olika forskningsdesigner som kunde användas i en studie som denna. En fallstudie ger
ypperliga möjligheter att undersöka ett eller flera komplicerade fenomen, vilket kunde
ha varit användbart i denna studie. En jämförande studie lämpar sig utmärkt för
frågeställningar som utreder skillnader eller likheter. Denna design har även goda
förutsättningar att förklara orsakssamband, å andra sidan kräver detta att fallen är
jämförbara. Annars finns det små möjligheter att generalisera resultaten (Bryman,
2018). Trots att det fanns flera möjligheter att välja mellan, så föll valet i slutändan på
den induktiva metoden. Denna metod bygger på användningen av en stor mängd utfall
46

Robert Johansson
eller empiriskt material. Man utgår från tidigare iakttagelser och bildar en slutsats
därefter. Vad beträffar datainsamlingen, utfördes en systematisk litteratursökning i
databaserna Google Scholar och Ebsco. Denna sökningsmetod skiljer sig ifrån den
”traditionella” litteratursökningen på ett antal punkter. I en systematisk
litteratursökning strävar man efter att samla in allt relevant material. Sökningarna görs
även i flera databaser. Sökstrategin bör också presenteras i avhandlingens
metodkapitel. I denna skall söktermerna, avgränsningarna och databaserna inkluderas
(Forsberg & Wengström, 2016). Utgångspunkten är att systematiskt identifiera, välja
och utvärdera sökresultaten (Mulrow & Oxman 1997). Söktermerna, inklusions- och
exklusionskriterierna och resultaten presenteras i kapitlen 3 och 4. Själva analysen
bygger på det induktiva resonemanget. Detta innebär att man inte utgår från en
existerande teori. Istället drar man slutsatser på basen av de observationer som gjorts i
tidigare studier. De utvalda artiklarna presenteras i en tabell i kapitel 4. Efter
noggranna överväganden valdes genom utvärderingsprocessen nio olika artiklar
baserat på deras relevans.
Studierna pekar på att det finns både likheter och skillnader i företags- och
miljöorganisationernas strategiska preferenser. Enligt Beyers (2008) är det inte
motiverat att anta att företagsgrupperna väljer inside-strategier endast p.g.a. sin
resursöverlägsenhet. Även om dessa organisationer har tendenser att använda sig av
denna typ av strategi. Det som är definitivt är att valen av strategier påverkas av en rad
olika faktorer. Dessa faktorer är vilken typ av organisation det rör sig om, den
institutionella miljön där lobbyingen äger rum, typ av policyfråga och
organisationernas

målsättning.

I

studierna

nämns

två

olika

fall

där

miljöorganisationerna har valt att använda sig av outside-strategin. Den första är Brent
Spar-affären och den andra var FORATOM-fallet (Hanegraaff, Beyers & Iskander,
2018). I bägge fallen valde Greenpeace att använda sig av påtryckningsmetoder genom
media och bojkottkampanjer. Dock är knappast dessa fall tillräckliga för att kunna
generalisera resultaten till alla andra fall, miljö- eller klimatfrågor som utmanas av
liknande grupperingar. Det är å andra sidan klart att Greenpeace som är en typ av
aktivistorganisation har föredragit att använda sig av metoder som just förknippas med
medborgaraktivism. Dock betyder det inte att alla miljöorganisationer väljer att
använda sig av dessa metoder. Faktum är att alla de faktorer som nämndes ovan gör
att varje fall är unikt och möjligheten till att göra breda generaliseringar är näst intill
omöjligt.
47

Robert Johansson
Junk (2015) fann även att framträdande och mindre komplexa sakfrågor som t.ex.
miljöfrågor, tenderar att lobbas med hjälp av outside-strategier. I kontrast, så brukar
sakfrågor som är mindre populära påverkas med hjälp av inside-strategier. Vesa och
m.fl. (2020) fann även att företagsorganisationer ofta väljer att undvika medierna när
de försöker påverka beslutsfattare.
Det skulle utan tvekan vara av stor nytta ifall det skulle finnas teorier som kunde
tillämpas i alla fall som berör företags- och miljöorganisationernas val av strategier.
En

bredare

fråga

för

framtidens

forskning

är

huruvida

det

nuvarande

lobbyinglandskapet kan representera den breda massan. I synnerhet Beyers efterlyser
möjligheten att utreda i vilken mån de nischade intresseorganisationerna påverkar i
större policyfrågor och hur de delegerar sina påverkningsmetoder. Detta kunde avgöra
ifall dessa organisationers kärnintressen kan representera allmänheten. Framsteg som
dessa kunde vara avgörande i debatten rörande direkt påverkan och demokratisk
representation inom EU (Beyers, 2008). Detta har även ifrågasatts tidigare från flera
olika håll. Är det ett systemfel eller är det så att vissa grupper är enbart svagt
representerade? Det är frågor som den framtida forskningen får ta ställning till.
