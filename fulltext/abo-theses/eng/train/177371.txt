Abstract
Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate sex differences in victimization from dating
aggression and attitudes towards it among university students in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Method: A questionnaire was completed by 109 female and 117 male university students in
Hanoi, Vietnam. It included the following scales: (a) acceptance of dating aggression perpetrated
by a man towards his female partner, (b) acceptance of dating aggression perpetrated by a woman
towards her male partner, (c) frequency of victimization from physical dating aggression, and (d)
frequency of victimization from verbal dating aggression.
Results: Males had been significantly more victimised from physical dating aggression by their
partner than females. A tendency was also found for males to be more victimised from verbal
dating aggression. Males accepted other males as perpetrators of dating aggression significantly
more often than did females. Females on the other hand accepted females as aggressors
significantly more often than did males. Positive correlations were found between victimization
from dating aggression and accepting attitudes towards both males and females as perpetrators
of dating aggression.
Conclusions: Sex differences were found regarding victimization from dating aggression and
accepting attitudes towards it.
Key words: physical and verbal dating aggression, acceptance of dating aggression, Vietnam

1. Introduction
1.1 Aim of the Study
The aim of the study was to investigate dating aggression among university students in Vietnam. Sex
differences and associations with attitudes toward dating aggression were also investigated. By
investigating dating aggression and attitudes toward it among university students in Hanoi, Vietnam, the
study seeks to contribute to the current literature and enhance a greater understanding of dating
aggression in Vietnam.

1.2 Intimate Partner Aggression and Dating Aggression
Interpersonal aggression and violence have long been areas of exploration for social scientists and
researchers (Lewis & Fremouw, 2001), especially domestic violence, sibling violence, child abuse and
elder abuse (Alhabib, Nur & Jones, 2010; Browne & Finkelhor, 1986; Frye & Karney, 2006; Straus &
Gelles, 1986). While all violence in all types of interpersonal relationships are worth studying and
exploring, intimate partner aggression is prevalent in many societies and has been increasingly
recognized as a pressing issue. According to the World Health Organization (2012), intimate partner
violence (IPV) refers to harmful behaviors, including physical injury, sexual and psychological abuse,
that are perpetrated by a former or current partner (i.e. spouse, dating partner or sexual partner) in intimate
relationships such as marriages, cohabitation and dating, and often causes lasting physical and emotional
damages to people who are subject to it. Due to the growing rate of perpetration, progress has been made
substantially in the study of abuse towards romantic partners, extending knowledge and understanding
of the topic. However, despite the variety of romantic relationships in which aggression can take place,
the investigation of intimate partner violence has primarily focused on married couples and little has been
shown about less committed relationships, which creates a widespread perception that marriage is the
more frequent context for intimate partner violence. Nevertheless, there appears to be a complete
contrast, indicating that premarital abuse is more prevailing (Cate, Henton, Koval, Christopher & Lloyd,
1982; Makepeace, 1981). In every three men and women who date, one uses or experiences physical
aggression, and the prevalence rate of violence is estimated to be three times higher in dating contexts
compared to that in married couples (Straus, 2008). Although the level of commitment in dating
relationships is lower than in established marriages, the consequences of dating violence is no less severe
in the physical, sexual and mental health of the victims (Lewis & Fremouw, 2001). However, the study
1

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

of this type of intimate partner violence remained understudied and has only proliferated since the
research of Makepeace (1981) in which one among five dating couples reported courtship violence,
mostly due to alcoholism, sexual denial and jealousy. Furthermore, research on dating violence has
shown evidence of severe consequences on individuals’ health, particularly reduced self-esteem,
depression, difficulties in controlling anger, and physical injuries (Hines & Straus, 2007; Jackson, Cram
& Seymour, 2000; Shorey, Stuart & Cornelius, 2011; Straight, Harper & Arias, 2003). This indicates the
need to direct the attention and put more emphasis on the dating context in the investigation of intimate
partner violence in dating relationships.
While there exist definitions for intimate partner violence and domestic violence, a universally
accepted definition for dating violence is still absent in the contemporary research literature, and existing
definitions offered by researchers are varied depending on the forms of violence. Sugarman and Hotaling
(1989) defined dating violence as the perpetration or threat of physical violence of one dating partner
towards the other one in an unmarried dyad. Although this conception clearly emphasized the dating
context in which two people are romantically involved such as dating, cohabitating and engaging,
Sugarman and Hotaling only mentioned physical abuse and excluded other forms of violence. In this
regard, recent studies have adopted more inclusive definitions in which dating violence is not only
manifested by physical aggression, but also by sexual and mental abuse (Lane & Gwartney-Gibbs, 1985;
Riggs & O'Leary, 1996; Anderson & Danis, 2007). Despite the variability in definitions, a great body of
literature has revealed the alarming rate of dating aggression in different types of violence. For example,
the review of Shorey, Cornelius and Bell (2008) showed that acts of psychological aggression (e.g
yelling, swearing or saying spiteful words) were perpetrated among 70-90% of dating couples, followed
by physical acts (such as hitting, slapping or kicking) in almost one third of surveyed couples, and 320% of dating couples experienced sexual abuse. Given the prevalence rate and the cultural factors of
the context where this current research takes place, the author will focus on physical and psycholgical
violence and exclude sexual abuse from the scope of the study.
Furthermore, as the present study seeks to examine gender differences in dating aggressions, the
distinctions between the two terms high intensity and low intensity aggressions should be addressed.
While violence is generally used to describe acts that aim to cause severe physical harm and injuries to
another person (Anderson & Bushman, 2002), aggressions are behaviors that harm others, ranging from
physical injury, emotional and social relation damages (DeWall, Anderson, & Bushman, 2012). Within
aggressions, researchers categorized behaviors in two types, particularly high intensity aggression and
2

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

low intensity aggression (Anderson, & Bushman, 2002). Accordingly, high intensity aggression is mostly
physical assault whereas low intensity aggression refers to other forms of intimate partner aggression
which aim to harm another person psychologically and socially. However, it should be noted that not all
physical aggressions are categorized as high intensity aggression. Behaviors such as slapping, spitting,
locking in, locking out or throwing objects, which belong to the subscale of physical aggression, are
considered low intensity aggression (Österman & Björkqvist, 2009). Moreover, although verbal
aggression has generally been underestimated by the public and people experiencing this form of
aggression tend to not regard it as intimate partner aggression, it is in fact a considerably strong precursor
of and can escalate into physical aggression (Jones & Gardner, 2002). Given this distinction and
categorization, the present study uses the term dating aggression instead of dating violence and was
constructed with the instrument scales measuring low intensity physical and verbal aggression within
dating relationships.

1.3 Dating Aggression among College Students
Dating aggression is not only a problem that needs to be in the focus of research, but also a detrimental
health and criminal phenomenon for people of all age, especially young college adults worldwide (Straus,
2008). Rates of physical violence among dating college couples have been reported to range from 19%
to 46% (Makepeace, 1981; Straus, 2004). The seriousness of this phenomenon is also demonstrated by
the prevalence of sexual and psychological components of aggression as approximately 30% of female
students and 10% of male students were found to experience sexual abuse, and around 80% of American
college students were perpetrators or victims of psychological aggression in the dating context (White &
Koss, 1991). Findings from previous studies have strengthened the need of addressing aggressive
behaviors among college students by revealing the consequences of this type of violence in future
relationships. First of all, as students are in the formative period of their development of social relations,
it became evident that behavioral patterns demonstrated in these years are likely to predict their behaviors
in relationships later on in their lives (O'Leary, Barling, Arias, Rosenbaum, Malone, & Tyree, 1989;
O’leary, Malone & Tyree, 1994; Straus, 2004). Not only do aggressive behaviors in this early phase of
adulthood precede marital violence, but they also play a contributing role to the intergenerational
transmission of aggression and violence (Moore & Elmore, 1991).

1.4 Gender Difference in Dating Aggression
Regarding dating aggression, several components have been extensively researched, and one of the most
raging debates is the gender difference in violence perpetration and victimization. On the one hand, the
conventional tenet in the literature of domestic violence and intimate partner violence has been primarily
focused on the high rate of violence against women, and the number of research and statistics available
about the victimization rate of intimate partner aggression among men is modest compared to those on
women. For example, Tjaden and Thoennes (2000) conducted an extensive survey with 16,000 American
men and women and concluded that women were more likely to be victims of mental, sexual and physical
assaults by their intimate male partners. According to these researchers, the victimization also lasted
much longer with more severe consequences on women’s health. In terms of physical injuries, female
victims account for 62% (Archer, 2000) and it is widely supported that women possess a higher risk of
experiencing sexual abuse (Coker, Davis, Arias, Desai, Sanderson, Brandt, & Paige, 2002). Globally,
one third of women aged at least 15 years are victims of physical and/or sexual violence caused by their
intimate partners during their lifetime (Devries et al., 2013). This prevalence rate is also close to the rate
of intimate partner violence against women in Vietnam. According to the National Research conducted
by the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (2010), among surveyed women in the age of 18-60, 58%
experienced all types of abuse or at least one type, either physically, sexually, mentally.
However, mixed evidence is present in a significant amount of studies on this issue, suggesting
different patterns of gender in violence victimization and perpetration. The first group of researchers
conducted studies which made it clear that men and women were likely to share an equal rate of
perpetrating aggressive acts towards their intimate partners (Reed, Raj, Miller & Silverman, 2010; White,
& Koss, 1991). Unlike the other scientists who viewed dating violence as an asymmetric phenomenon in
which men were the primary perpetrator of violence, Cate et al. (1982) pointed out the reciprocal nature
of abuse in dating relationships in their research on premarital aggression among 355 college students.
This is substantiated by the finding that among 68% of abusive couples, each partner was both the
perpetrator and victim of violence. The study conducted by Harned (2001) also supported this idea by
surveying undergraduate and graduate students, revealing the statistics of 22% of women and 21% of
men being victims of physical abuse. Consistent with these findings, the notable cross-national study of
Straus (2008) provided the support to the notion that dating violence is symmetric in terms of gender
because bidirectionality was the most reported pattern of violence. Particularly, out of a sample of 13,601

4

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

university students, almost 30% of male and female students self-reported violent behaviors against their
dating partners.
While a considerable amount of studies consistently addressed the equal prevalence of violence
perpetration by genders, it is evident in several researches that dating violence perpetration rate is even
higher among women (Arias, Doroszewicz & Forbes, 2008; Cate et al., 1982; Samios & O'Leary, 1987;
Straus & Ramirez, 2007). Specifically, Archer (2000), using act-based measures, found that physical
violence rate was higher among female partners than among their male counterparts, in both perpetration
and frequency. As one of the researchers who put forward the study on dating violence among collegeaged population, Cate et al. (1982) revealed that men were the sole violence perpetrator in only 10%
among the studied abusive relationships while the data for women was 22%. This contention was also
supported by the findings of Straus and Ramirez (2007) on the gender symmetry in physical violence as
female partners were twice as likely to be the only abusive one in the relationship. Concluded from a
study on college students, Cercone, Beach and Arias (2005) reported higher victimization rates among
males with 30% for psychological violence and 18% for severe physical agression, while the figures for
the female counterparts were 24% and 13% respectively. This was consistent with previous works of
Simonelli & Ingram (1998) and Katz et al. (2002). This pattern of gender asymmetry in dating
aggressions was not only found in Western and developed countries, but researches also concluded the
same trend in developing countries such as Ghana and South Sudan in Africa, where men were victims
of physical, indirect and cyber aggression more often than women (Darko, Österman, & Björkqvist,
2019; Ndoromo, Österman, & Björkqvist, 2018). Yet, it requires careful consideration to draw the
conclusion when it comes to sexual abuse as there exist consistent proofs of males being the dominant
offenders instead of females (Bergman, 1992; Sears, Byers & Price, 2007).

1.5 Attitudes towards Dating Aggression
A plethora of studies conducted over the past decades has shed light on the awareness of dating
aggression, and among the focuses of research, individual attitudes have received much attention as risk
factors of the perpetration of dating aggression (Rouse, 1988). Kalmuss (1984), for example, stated that
traditional attitudes toward women due to patriarchal systems had a significant correlation with dating
violence by men. However, a considerable number of researches, including the study of Alexander
(1988), highlighted the positive relationship between attitude toward women of women and the
prevalence of courtship violence. Other than attitudes toward the other sex, beliefs about acceptable
5

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

extent of violent behaviors in dating relationship have been suggested to have significant influences on
perpetration and victimization of dating aggression (Christine & Kardatzke, 2007). Perpetrators of
violent acts in dating context are likely to hold attitudes validating their aggression. Similarly, attitudinal
acceptance of an individual has a positive correlation with their acts of courtship violence (Slep, Cascardi,
Avery-Leaf & O'Leary, 2001) in not only their past and present relationship, but also later in life
(O'Keefe, 1997). In this regard, the groundbreaking study of Straus (2004) on university students in 16
countries showed a correlation of attitude toward aggression and dating violence among college students
as the higher the number of students showing approval to intimate partner violence, the greater the rate
of dating aggression prevalence. In addition, it is evident that both male and female college students
demonstrated more favourable attitudes toward physical and psychological violence perpetrated by
females than by male (Price et al., 1999). Based on these initial findings, several programs have been
made to address accepting attitudes toward dating violence among college students to prevent dating
aggression perpetration (Anderson et al., 2001).

1.6 Dating Aggression and Attitudes Toward Dating Aggression in Vietnam
While dating violence has been recognized as a serious and detrimental problem in many countries with
evidence offered and fortified in international studies (Lewis & Fremouw, 2001; Straus, 2004; Straus,
2008), empirical literature on intimate partner violence in Vietnam has focused mostly on violence in the
marriage context and shed lights on the male-to-female aggression. Few, if any, researches have been
conducted on femal-perpetrated violence (Schuler, Lenzi, Hoang, Vu, Yount & Quach, 2016; Yount,
Higgins, VanderEnde, Krause, Tran, Schuler & Hoang, 2016). In addition, there primarily exists
descriptive information about aggressive behaviors in dating relationship among Vietnamese young
adults. The first and most notable quantitative attempt to measure the prevalence of courtship violence
is the study carried out by YChange – a community organization advocating for gender equality endorsed
by UN Women in Vietnam in 2016. Data gathered from over 350 men and women provided a descriptive
picture of dating violence in Vietnam with approximately 64% of young adults experiencing at least one
form of dating violence (YChange, 2016). Contrary to common perception of intimate partner violence
in Vietnam, the research found that while the perpetration rate of severe violent acts, such as choking
and using weapons, was higher among men than women, 3.7% compared to 1.7% and 0.5% compared
to 0.3% respectively, women demonstrated significantly higher rates of physical assaults, mental abusive
and technological control. As it has become evident that attitudes toward dating aggression is a strong
6

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

predictor of the actual aggressive acts, the attitudinal component has been explored. However, the
research topic is limited to attitudes toward marital violence and violence against women by men (Yount,
VanderEnde, Zureick-Brown, Hoang, Schuler & Tran, 2014). Despite the promulgation of the law on
domestic violence in 2007, almost 95% of married female participants in the first National Study on
Domestic Violence Against Women in Vietnam (General Statistics Office of Vietnam, 2010) showed
acceptance for physically abusive treatment of men to women in certain situations where women
disobeyed, refused to have sex, were suspected of being unfaithful and so on. The study also revealed a
substantial gender gap in violence-accepting attitudes as women showed greater favorable attitudes
toward intimate partner violence than men. The study of YChange (2016) gave more focus to attitudes
toward dating violence and indicated that 44% of the surveyed people objected male-to-female abuse but
accepted female-to-male violence.

1.7 Predictors of Dating Aggression and Attitudes Toward Dating Aggression in Vietnam
The social and cultural norms and beliefs that permit or encourage intrafamily violence against women
are manifestations of a long-standing hierarchical and patriarchal social model in many parts of the world,
including Vietnam. For thousands of years, the country has been strongly influenced by the ancient
Chinese Confucianism and Taoism. Of all the religious beliefs that have been introduced and practiced
in Vietnam, Confucianism and Taoism exerted the greatest influences in the construction of the society
(Bui & Morash, 2008). Social philosophy of Confucianism views the family as the most fundamental
unit of society and sets rules that governs the stability of social relationships. These rules include
collectivism over individualism, face saving, and social harmony at the expense of individual rights and
needs (Chia, 2012). With the tradition of patrilineal ancestor worshipping in which men are the ones to
carry on the family’s lineage, Vietnamese people highly value male progeny over females. Thus, men
are superior, and women hold the inferior position in both familial and societal contexts. In the marriage
relationship, women are expected to comply with the principle of three submissive relationships, to their
fathers when unmarried, to their husbands in marriage, and to their sons if widowed. They must obey
their husbands, show respect to everyone else and adjust themselves to maintain the household harmony
(Rydstrom, 2003). Literature on domestic violence has shed a light on various factors regarded as threats
to masculinity that contribute to the use of violence by men toward their partners, including economic
dependency and social status among others (Bui & Morash, 2008). For men, working is not solely a mean
of income generator, but also a mechanism of masculinity, self confidence and manhood identity
7

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

construction (Gecas, 1989). The survey conducted by MacMillan and Gartner (1999) with over 8000
Canadian women revealed the correlation of employment and wife battering. They found that the rate of
experiencing physical violence, jealousy and denial to financial access was highest when the women
were employed and their spouses were jobless. The same pattern was found in Vietnam through the
research of Luke, Schuler, Bui, Pham & Tran (2007) where husbands who perpetrated abusive bahaviors
possessed lower economic and social statuses than their female partners. Men’s lack of economic
resources, together with sexual jealousy as a result of the construction of femininity that highly values
female virginity and loyalty, is also an attribute to the aggressive and violent bahaviors of Vietnamese
men. These aggressive behaviors are often displayed when men perveive or doubt that their partner cheat
on them, which threatens their ability to control their partners and challenges their masculine authority.

1.8 Hypothesis and Research Questions
The above-mentioned studies motivate one hypothesis and three research questions regarding
victimization from aggressive behaviors in dating relationships and attitudes toward it among university
students in Hanoi, Vietnam.
The following hypothesis was made:
1. Males were expected to have been significantly more victimised from low intensity physical and verbal
dating aggression by their partner than females (Darko, Björkqvist, & Österman, 2019; Ndoromo,
Österman, & Björkqvist, 2017)
The following research questions were made:
1. Sex differences in acceptance of females and males as perpetrators of dating aggression were studied.
2. The relationship between victimization from low intensity dating aggression and accepting attitudes
towards it among both males and females was investigated.

2. Method
2.1 Sample
A questionnaire was completed by 226 university students in Hanoi, 117 males and 109 females. All
respondents were unmarried. Of the participants 53% were currently in a dating relationship, and 47%
had been in one before.

2.2 Instrument
The questionnaire included the following scales: (a) acceptance of dating aggression perpetrated by a
man towards his female partner (10 items, α = .96), (b) acceptance of dating aggression perpetrated by a
woman towards her male partner (10 items, α = .96), (c) frequency of victimization from physical dating
aggression (10 items, α = .84), and (d) frequency of victimization from verbal dating aggression (8 items,
α = .90).
The response alternatives were all on five-point scales. For both scales measuring the acceptance, the
alternatives were 0 = strongly disagree; 1 = disagree; 2 = neutral; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree. For
frequency of victimization, the alternatives were 0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = seldom; 3 = sometimes;
4 = often. Single items of the scales are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

2.3 Procedure
The collection of data was done with an online questionnaire. An email with details of the study was sent
to the training coordinators at two universities in Hanoi seeking approval for the data collection. Upon
approval of the universities, a link to the questionnaire was distributed the students who agreed to
participate. The link was also distributed online by social media channels, like Facebook and Twitter,
and by university email. The questionnaire was available for responding from November 15th, 2019 to
December 4th, 2019.

3.2 Sex Differences in Victimization from Dating Aggression
A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with sex as independent variable and
victimization from two types of dating aggression as dependent variables (Table 4, Fig. 1). The
multivariate analysis was significant. The univariate analyses showed that males compared to females
had been significantly more victimised from physical dating aggression by their partner. A tendency was
also found for males to be more victimised from verbal dating aggression.

4. Discussion
4.1 Summary of the Findings
The present study was carried out to extend the body of research on dating aggressions by investigating
the gender differences in the victimization rate of dating aggressions and attitudes toward such behaviors
in dating relationships of both men and women. It provided quantitative data on dating aggression among
university students in Hanoi with approximately one third of the respondents reported victimization of
physical aggressions while the prevalence rate of verbal aggression victimization was 80%. These datas
suggest that dating aggressions among the population of Hanoian college students is a serious problem.
Based on previous studies on low intensity intimate partner aggression (Darko, Österman, &
Björkqvist, 2019; Ndoromo, Österman, & Björkqvist, 2017), it was expected that male university
students in Hanoi would report higher victimization rates of dating aggression than female students. The
results from the present study gave clear evidence for this statement and further highlighted that same
pattern in both physical and verbal aggressions. This finding is also consistent with previous international
studies (Cercone et al., 2005; Simonelli & Ingram, 1998; Katz, Kuffel, & Coblentz, 2002) and the study
of YChange (2016) in Vietnam. As discussed earlier, while women tend to be victims of severe physical
violence (Hamby & Jackson, 2010), they have been reported to perpetrate more minor physical and
psychological aggressions than men do. This pattern in the dating context of univeristy students may be
attributed to the nature of the relationships. Particularly, compared to marriage, dating relationships lack
an offical commitment between the two partners, which heightens the degree of insecurity, jealousy and
controlling acts of women. Higher incidence of female-on-male verbal aggressions in this study can also
be understood through the common perception of verbal aggression in the field of dating aggression. The
aggressive verbal acts analysed in this study such as initiating a quarrel, talking in provocative languages,
calling partners with bad names, nagging and interrupting while partner is talking are not violence
(Karakurt & Silver, 2013). Given the fact that in such a patriarchal society as in Vietnam, violence in
marriage or dating relationships is normally stigmatized, male respondents may hesitate to report
physical violence and feel more comfortable to report their experience of verbal aggressions perpetrated
by their female partners. This is another possible explaination for the higher victimization rate of minor
physical and verbal aggressions among men.
In terms of attitudes towards aggressions, contradict to the expectation that both male and female
students would show more acceptance to aggressions perpetrated by female than male partners, female
15

university students endorsed more accepting attitudes toward female aggression whereas males
demonstrated more acceptance of dating aggression committed by men.
A theory that could be used to explain this tendency of accepting female-on-male aggressions among
females is the changing gender roles (Jackson, 1999). Gender have been conceptualized along two
continuums of masculinity and femininity (Bern, 1974). It was Connell (1987) who introduced the
definition of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity to explain the widely accepted and
deeply embedded gender roles in a many parts of the world. Along this concept, controlling masculinity
refers to the characteristics such as being strong physically, aggressive and rational in order to control
themselves and others under various circumstances whereas emphasized femininity includes culturally
scripted traits such as being caring, dependent, emotional and subordinate to males (Kersten, 1996). Sex
role stereotypes of how men should be dominant, superior and aggressive while women are expected to
be passive, submissive and dependent are a factor supporting and affirming the legitimation of men’s
higher power over women (Finn, 1986). Traditionally, women were dependent on men emotionally and
economically in both social and relationship context. It has traditionally been depicted that men are
perpetrators and women are victims of intimate partner aggressions and other forms of violence. With
the increasing independence and empowerment of women as a result of feminism and advocacy on
changing patriarchal discrimination and gender inequality in Vietnam, the use of indirect physical and
verbal aggressions by women on men could be a demonstration of retaliation against the social norms on
gender biases and a symbol of women obtaining power and control in the relationship dyad (Follingstad,
Wright, Lloyd, & Sebastian, 1991).
Furthermore, female-on-male aggressions could be the results of self-defense. As in the study of
Molidor & Tolman (1998), self-defense was the reason for over a third of the cases where girls acted as
the perpetrators of dating aggression, while the percentage of boys using self-defense to justify their
behaviors was only 6%. It may well be that as women do not possess as much physical strength as men,
they deploy verbal aggression as a conflict tactic to gain the superiority over their partners. With the
traditional view of men being the primary perpetrator of aggression toward women, female students may
feel fewer sanctions and less negavity against female perpetrated aggression, this possibly contributes to
the favorable attitudes of women to the use of aggressions upon male counterparts.
Toward male-on-female aggressions, men were more accepting than women. While the egalitarian
shift in attitudes toward gender roles has been documented in recent research (Dao, 2018; Huang, 2017),
Vietnam is still a highly patriarchal society with principles of Confucianism and Taoism embedded in
16

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

the society for thousands of years. With the tradition of patrilineal ancestor worshipping which means
men, not women, are the ones to carry on the family’s lineage, Vietnamese people highly value male
progeny over females and thus, men are superior and women hold the inferior position in both familial
and societal contexts. With this ideology, the use of aggression and violence against women to maintain
the power relation in intimate relationships is justifiable and acceptable to many people, especially men
(Bui & Morash, 2008). Thus, the adherence to traditional characterizations of gender roles remains strong
and persistent, especially among men, which partly explain the disparity in attitudes of males towards
dating aggressions with male perpetrators and female perpetrators, particularly a higher acceptance for
male-on-female aggressions in dating compared to female-on-male aggressions.
For the third research question, compared to the expectation of the study that a positive association
was expected to be found between victimization from dating aggression and accepting attitudes towards
both males and females as perpetrators of dating aggression, there was a slight difference. There was a
positive correlation between victimization of dating aggressions and accepting attitudes toward these
aggressive behaviors perpetrated by males in dating relationships. Students who endorsed accepting
attitudes toward low intensity verbal and physical aggression perpetrated by males were likely to be
victimised by those aggressive acts. This finding was consistent with results from previous studies
(O'Keefe, 1997; Price et al., 1999; Slep, Cascardi, Avery-Leaf & O'Leary, 2001; Straus, 2004) and
highlighted the correlation of accepting attitudes and victimization of dating aggression among young
Vietnamese males and females. However, the same correlation was not found with accepting attitudes
toward aggression perpetrated by females.

4.2 Limitations of the Study
The study presents results that add to the current literature on dating violence in Vietnam. Nevertheless,
the findings possess some limitations which need to be critically addressed. The primary limitation of
the study was that the sample was composed of students enrolled in only two universities. Although this
group of respondents was chosen randomly, it represented a small proportion of undergraduate students
in the city of Hanoi. Thus, sampling a bigger and more diverse group of university students would create
a more comprehensive understanding of dating violence among young adults in Hanoi, Vietnam.
The second limitation was the exclusion of sexual aggression from the scope of the study. While
acknowledging that recent studies have adopted more inclusive definitions in which dating aggression is
not only manifested physically but also sexually and mentally (Lane & Gwartney-Gibbs, 1985; Riggs &
17

Nguyen Thi Thu Ha

O'Leary, 1996; Anderson & Danis, 2007), the scope of this current study only included the physical and
mental aspects of dating aggression due to the cultural characteristics of the sampling population.
Finally, as participants were chosen randomly and assessments of victimization from dating
aggressions were concluded from self-reports only. This creates the need to study both members of the
relationship in future research.

4.3 Implications of the Study
Results from the study highlighted the sex differences in victimization and attitudes toward dating
aggression among young adults in Hanoi, Vietnam. Given the high victimization rate of low intensity
physical and verbal aggression among male students, further research and prevention programs shall
attempt to target both males and females as victims of intimate partner aggressions instead of focusing
on women. Similarly, the findings also suggest that programs aimed to prevent dating aggressions among
university students in Vietnam should not deploy the sex-biased approaches such as the typical victimrelated programs for only women or the perpetrator-related programs only for men.
Findings on gender differences in victimization of dating aggression may be helpful for future
prevention programs aimed at reducing physically and verbally aggressive behaviors in dating
relationships. These programs may, for example, incorporate education about the inappropriateness of
using low intensity aggressions in both men and women. With the inclusion of verbal aggression in the
research scope, the study shed lights on the prevalence and seriousness of verbal aggression, which has
been generally out of attention and underestimated within the scale of intimate partner aggression. The
considerably high rate of both male and female undergraduate students being victims of verbal aggression
implies that more focus should be put on this subscale of aggression in dating relationships as it has been
linked with escalated physical assaults and potential detrimental impacts on physical and mental health
of the victims (Jones, & Gardner, 2002).
