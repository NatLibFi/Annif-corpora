Title of the Thesis: The right to reparation for conflict-related gender-based violations of international
law – The individual’s right to reparation in international humanitarian law and human rights law applicable in Africa
Supevisor: Catarina Krause
During armed conflicts, gender-based violence is commonly used as a method of warfare, and women
and girls disproportionately make up a majority of the victims. International humanitarian law, regulating the two parties of a conflict, has for long remained a body of law that has not addressed individual
rights. Though arguments towards a more victim-centric interpretations have emerged, an individual
right to reparation for violations of international humanitarian law still remains to be enforced. Determining, to what extent the existing human rights mechanisms are able to contribute to the realisation of
victims’ rights during armed conflicts is therefore in place.
The thesis looks into the right to reparation in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
and the African regional human instruments, most importantly the African Charter on Human and
Peoples’ Rights. The regional human rights instruments may best address the needs and charachteristics of a specific region, due to which a comparison will be drawn between regional bodies that have
developed significant jurisprudence on reparations; the Inter-American Commission and the Court of
Human Rights.
Though the case law of both the African Commission and the Court and the Human Rights Committee
have confirmed the existence of the right to reparation and have utilized their respective treaty provisions in order to award individuals with reparations, a solid and accomplished jurisprudence on the actualisation of the right to reparation in armed conflicts cannot yet be detected. The Inter-American Court
has taken significant steps in creating sustainable standards for state responsibility for violations of
human rights, specifically on terms of gender-based violence. Similar obligations to prevent, investigate and provide reparations for violations of human rights can be identified in the jurisprudence of the
African Commission, but to a lesser extent. The obligation to investigate is, however, essentially interlinked with the obligation to provide reparations, through which the obligation to repair can been seen
as strengthened on the African continent. Instruments such as the Maputo Protocol are moulding the
bigger picture towards a more seamless interplay between the two regimes. The acknowledgements
about the existence of a right to reparation have very likely contributed to the number of initiatives and
resolutions on the topic.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Background to the study

Societies emerging from eras of conflict and repression need to address past mass violence and human rights abuses in order to establish sustaining peace. Armed conflicts
place populations in particularly vulnerable positions, the people most affected by the
armed conflict typically being among the most vulnerable in society.1 Although steps
forward have been taken in the protection of the individual in situations of armed conflicts, in reality, individuals still continue to suffer at the hands of abusive governments
and other actors, such as armed groups. The high prevalence of gender-based violence
(GBV) has been documented in various conflict-related contexts.2 The underlying acceptance of violence, particularly against women, existing within many societies, seems
to become more outwardly acceptable when conflicts shatter the ordinary, every-day life
of people.
Gender-based violence can be considered any harmful act directed against individuals
or groups of individuals on the basis of their gender and it can be translated into a violation of human rights or a form of discrimination.3 Although men and boys are also targets of GBV, it is women and girls that still disproportionately make up a majority of
the victims of gender-based violence in conflicts.4 During armed conflicts, e.g. sexual
violence is commonly used as a method of warfare to instil fear, to humiliate, control,
disperse and/or forcibly relocate civilian members of an ethnic group or a community.5

torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), 8 (right not to be subjected to slavery
or forced labour), 9 (right to liberty and security of the person), 10 (right of all persons deprived of their
liberty to be treated with dignity) and article 17 (right to private and family life), articles 2, 3 and 18(3) of
the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ rights and article 2 in the Protocol on the Rights of Women
in Africa (the Maputo Protocol).

Addressing GBV as a human rights matter establishes legal obligations to states and
therefore compels states to prevent such violence, to punish perpetrators and furthermore, to provide the individual with access to effective remedies and reparation through
human rights mechanisms.6
Reparations are growingly brought up in dealing with the aftermath of conflicts as the
attention has started to shift towards a more victim-centred approach in the realm of
international law. While acts of gender-based violence may account to crimes under
customary international law, in addition to crimes under the Rome Statute and breaches
of i.e. the Geneva Conventions, the dichotomy of modern conflicts poses a challenge in
the search for accountability. When it comes to violations perpetrated during noninternational armed conflicts (furthermore, NIACs), holding perpetrators accountable
and proving the violations committed by e.g. armed groups is difficult, let alone issuing
binding decisions on providing victims with reparations. Understanding individuals’
rights in the realm of conflicts is the first step in addressing the needs of a victim.
Reparation efforts have historically overlooked women’s and girls’ needs and concerns.
However, in recent years there has been an increase in recognition of the need for, and
potential of, reparations acknowledging the gendered nature of violence.7 A study on
the first decision the Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court (furthermore,
the ICC) issued on reparations, the Lubanga case, illustrating the operation of the reparations regime, shows that the ICC’s reparations mandate will have little value for victims of sexual and gender-based violence unless gender injustices are recognised at each
and every stage of the investigation and trial process, and pursued with adequate resources.8 The ICC has also yet to come with an outcome pronouncing specifically on
gender-based crimes and reparations for them.
Effort on the reinvigoration of the existing international humanitarian law (furhermore,
IHL) mechanisms have been suggested in search for accountability,9 as scholars are

6

Progress has been made on the conceptual level, demonstrated by e.g. the Nairobi Declaration Women’s
and Girls’ Right to a Remedy and Reparation (2007) and by the Special Rapporteur on violence against
women (VOW) advocating for gender-sensitive reparations for conflict-related sexual violence in e.g. the
Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (2014).
Reparations have the potential to facilitate the rebuilding of women’s lives: para. 3 of the declaration
states that ‘reparation must drive post-conflict transformation of socio-cultural injustices, and political
and structural inequalities that shape the lives of women and girls; that reintegration and restitution by
themselves are not sufficient goals of reparation, since the origins of violations of women’s and girls’
human rights predate the conflict situation’

increasingly arguing that the traditional legal construct, considering IHL as a regime
regulating merely the two parties of a conflict, is no longer perfectly accurate and that
an individual right to reparations for violations of IHL is emerging.10 Since human
rights mechanisms were not especially designed to respond to the needs of armed conflict victims, it is evident that their ability to answer to their needs is not comprehensive.
Keeping this in mind, determining, to what extent the existing human rights mechanisms are able to contribute to the realisation of victims’ rights, as well as a study of the
interpretation of IHL regarding individual rights is in place.

1.2

African conflicts and reparations

Numerous armed conflicts take place on the African continent, and an increasing proportion of the actors involved in peacekeeping operations on the continent are African.
Yet scholarly writing on the regulation of these conflicts lags behind.11 The ICC has
largely, yet not without criticism, focused its attention on African conflicts, and while
intervention on the continent may be justified, it has also been accused of taking on cases that were already being addressed by the national courts.12 Bearing in mind the ICC’s
role as a court of last resort, the main focus in the efforts towards effective realisation of
a victim’s rights should therefore lie elsewhere. Therefore, it seems useful to examine
what are the possibilities of victims of gender-based violations of human rights and humanitarian law to obtain reparations, based on the regional human rights instruments, as
well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (furthermore, the ICCPR).
Addressing gender-based violence has historically not been easy in communities and
traditional settings that however, from the point of view of an individual, hold significant cultural authority in Africa. Additionally, formal justice systems may in principle
offer redress for women, but they will likely face many barriers in accessing them.13
Studies have shown that formal and traditional justice seem to have little or no coordination or synergy in their functions, and that very few women actually even access the
formal justice systems.14 Though traditional justice systems run in communities are
generally more accessible to women, they may be biased against them. No perfect sys10

tem seems to exist in terms of addressing gender-based violence. Furthermore, Evans
has previously noted that the issue of reparations has for the time being not received
sufficient attention in the jurisprudence of the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights (furthermore, the African Commission) either. In some cases, dealing with
serious violations of human rights, the issue of reparations has not even been addressed.15 The Inter-American Court and Commission on Human Rights have on the
contrary succeeded in creating a notably consistent jurisprudence on reparations.16
The existence of regional human rights instruments as well as quasi-judicial, or nonjudicial mechanisms may resonate better in local conditions than global, universal ones.
Regional systems may offer different degrees of flexibility and room for on the groundmechanisms such as commissions and local forms of justice. It seems helpful to study
whether there in fact is a difference of approach between the regional instruments and
the ICCPR. As a universal instrument the ICCPR represents the recognition of basic
rights and fundamental freedoms inherent to all human beings, regardless of geographical location or citizenship. By reviewing the protection awarded by the ICCPR and the
African regional instruments, the thesis aims to discover the extent to which the individual in Africa can access reparations for gender-violence, in a conflict setting. To
draw a comparison with a more developed reparations regime and between two regional
systems, the African regional norms will therefore be compared to the Inter-American
regional human rights system. Due to the well-developed jurisprudence in the area of
reparations in the Inter-American system, a comparison between the available African
regional instruments and the Inter-American Instruments is particularly interesting. As
regional instruments the both two systems hold the potential to address issues of regional nature. As the Human Rights Committee’s contributions to the realm of reparations
largely arise from its concluding observations and do not have a regional focus, the
comparative analysis focuses on the case law of the African and the Inter-American
regional systems.

Research question

This thesis examines the individual’s right to reparation in an armed conflict for genderbased violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in
Africa. The main question the thesis seeks to clarify, whether there is a legal basis for a
right to reparation for an individual victim of gender-based violations occurred during
15

5
an armed conflict. This question can be approached by breaking it down into two subquestions; does international humanitarian law grant the individual a right to reparation
for gender-based violations, e.g. grave breaches of the branch of law? Is international
human rights law able to provide an individual victim of gender-based, conflict-related
violence a right to reparation in the context of an armed conflict in Africa?
The study will first (Chapter 2) look at the individual's position in international humanitarian law, identifying the influence of international human rights law on the individual’s position in the domain of international law in general. After this, the chapter will
discuss the interaction between IHL and international human rights law (furthermore,
IHRL), and their influence in interpreting the bodies of law. Chapter 3 establishes the
different ways in which the African Commission and the Human Rights Committee
have read IHL into human rights law provisions and seeks to clarify the impact on the
individual. Chapter 4 discusses the positions the treaty bodies have taken on the right to
reparation for gender-based violations of human rights. The chapter draws a comparison
between the application of the African Charter and its Protocols and the Inter-American
Convention in order to clarify how the regional instruments differ in their approach to
reparations for gender-violence in armed conflicts.

1.4

Limitations

The thesis takes as a starting point the previously mentioned lack of significant developments in the ICC regime in awarding gender-sensitive reparations for victims on the
African continent. Also, since the thesis focuses on the relationship between IHL and
IHRL, and the applicability of IHRL in armed conflicts, it will therefore not take into
consideration the contributions of other international criminal tribunals and quasijudicial bodies. While using the other international human rights treaty bodies as a
means to compare and contrast the findings of the research, the focus will be on the African human rights mechanism and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
The thesis will not in detail elaborate on the content of reparations, but will address
them as a whole. Furthermore, the role of reparations and their ability to reach the intended goals they were meant to reach will not be discussed. The question of the ‘transformative’ nature of reparations, a highly topical conversation on the effects of reparations on the roots and causes in the society leading to gender-based violations, is therefore also out of the scope of this paper. The thesis will also not focus on the effects of
whether it is a group or an individual that is lodging the complaint since The African

6
Charter and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights as well as the American Convention on Human Rights allow for individual complaints regarding violations of the respective conventions. Differentiating between
group and individual complaints is outside the scope of the thesis since the focus will be
on the right to reparation, not the content of them.

1.5

Method and sources

The main legal sources in international humanitarian law utilized in the paper consist of
the Hague Convention (IV) on the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907, the Geneva Conventions (GC I–IV) and their Additional Protocols I and II. Additional sources
include the case law of the International Court of Justice and its predecessor and the
International Committee of the Red Cross (furthermore the ICRC) customary international humanitarian law study. In international human rights law, since the United Nations is considered the main norm-creator for Africa, the role of the United Nations treaty bodies and their jurisprudence is compared with the jurisprudence of the African
Commission and the Court applying the African Charter, most importantly the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Human Rights Committee as its
monitoring body.17 Cases referring to or drawing from IHL will particularly be considered. The jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court and Commission regarding reparations for gender-based violence will be discussed as a comparison to understand the
regional differences in the jurisprudence related to gender-based violence and the responsibility of the state for violations of gendered nature.
More specific to gender-based violence, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human
and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the Maputo
protocol will be discussed as an instrument specifically addressing violence against
women in armed conflicts. Relevant international case law outside of the African context will be referred to as examples of the pre-existing interpretation of the relevant
rules of IHL and human rights law for this study, since the rules of IHL haven been invoked regionally under relevant human rights law provisions included in human rights
treaties. The ILC articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts18 are
taken into consideration as a source providing general guidance addressing basic issues
of responsibility and remedy, irrespective of the primary or substantive rules they may
be applied to. Their relevance for the purpose of this study is based on their efforts to
17

track the current state of international law in order to encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification.19
Christine Evans’s study on the right to reparation in international law for victims of
armed conflict20 provides a basis on which the question of reparations will be discussed.
As a thorough examination of the right to reparations in armed conflicts, including different types of reparations, Evans’s study allows this thesis to focus on narrower subject, reparations for gendered violence. Hampson21, Todeschini22 well as Droege23 and
Hailbronner24 have contributed to the discussion on the relationship between international human rights law and IHL from the point of view of human rights instruments,
while also covering the practical overlap between IHL and human rights law. While
Todeschini effectively points out the questions evoked by the International Court of
Justice (furthermore, the ICJ) statements on the relationship between IHL and human
rights law, Hampson focuses on the treaty body perspective, providing insight on the
question of the concurrent applicability of IHL and human rights law. Her analysis on
the different possibilities in interpreting the relationship of the two bodies of law provides a frame in which the interpretations of the treaty bodies will be observed. Furthermore, Todeschini’s fairly recent assessment of the normative and practical implications of the Human Rights Committee jurisprudence, pointing out both challenges and
merits, is considered a prominent voice in the analysis. Droege, highlighting the complementarity on the two bodies of law, shows evidence of the influence of human rights
law on IHL by pointing out the detailed, yet less protective provisions of IHL, in comparison with human rights law. Her arguments provide a more practical view on the
right to reparation, though ending up creating expectations towards the reparations regime of the ICC. As African contributors, Hailbronner and Viljoen25 mostly concentrate
specifically on Africa. Viljoen characterizes the African regional approach to the relationship between IHL and human rights law as interpretative, providing a wide analysis
of the affairs affected by the relationship and setting the stage for further research.26
Following Viljoen, Hailbronner seeks to analyse the jurisprudence of the African regional bodies in a global context, providing a basis for the thesis to continue in terms of

REPARATIONS IN IHL AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW APPLICABLE IN AFRICA

2.1

IHL primary rights

In international law, the right to reparation is generally viewed as a secondary right
connecting to a primary, substantive right that has been breached.28 In order to find out
to what extent individuals are granted a right to reparation under IHL it first needs to be
established whether they actually have primary rights under IHL and secondly, upon the
occurrence of a breach of a primary right, whether an individual has the right to claim
reparation under the same branch of law.
As humanitarian rules were originally designed to apply in relationships between states
in the form of prohibitions, the notion of ‘rights’ was not clearly defined. Whether individuals possess rights under the law of armed conflict and can be considered as possible victims depends on if they can be considered beneficiaries of IHL rules. According
to Zegveld, the simple recognition of victims of violations of international humanitarian
law itself already presupposes the existence of individual rights of victims in IHL.29
Traditionally considered, individuals have indeed been the beneficiaries of the regulations, but not holders of claims, as they were afforded protection as objects, without
being the subjects holding rights.30 It has been argued that most of IHL provisions generally address states parties to the Convention, providing them with duties of protection
without the reference to ‘rights’.31 It has also been argued that many of the treaty provisions relating to the conduct of hostilities are worded as ‘prohibitions’ concerning the
belligerent parties, rather than actual rights granted to specific persons.32 Based on these
observations, it has been considered that the individual under these provisions is a mere
indirect beneficiary of the obligations, which are addressed to the parties to the conflict,
and which grant the analogous rights only to the belligerent parties.33
However, established the traditional interpretation of IHL has been, references to
‘rights’ can be found in IHL. The 1949 Geneva Conventions explicitly confer ‘rights’ to

protected persons34 and a number of rules refer precisely to concepts such as ‘rights’,
‘entitlements’ or ‘benefits’, pointing towards an individual rights holder.35 The multiple
references to individual rights within the IHL framework date to a time after the 1907
Hague Convention, to which the origin concept of reparation in IHL has been traced.36
Kleffner argues that one can identify rules containing elements of individual benefits in
IHL, even without concentrating on specific provisions as examples. As an example, the
grave breaches provisions could be analysed as conferring individual humanitarian
rights against acts such as wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body and
health or torture or inhuman treatment.37 Kleffner professes that the same holds true for
norms applicable in non-international armed conflicts, such as humiliating and degrading treatment and the prohibition of violence to life, stipulated in Common Art. 3 and
Art. 4 of Additional Protocol II.38 Whether these elements could provide a foundation
for an individual claim is, however, a different question altogether.
Referring to the development of contemporary international law, under which individuals are no longer considered as ‘objects’ of rights accruing only to states, Gaeta proposes an affirmed standing for individuals as holders of primary rights. Accordingly, it
would be mindless to affirm that this position as a rights holder would dissolve in a situation when their need for protection against abuse ‘reaches its peak’ and they are the
most vulnerable, namely during armed conflicts.39 Furthermore, Gaeta refers to art. 7 of
GC I, II and III and art. 8 of GC IV which articulate that the protected persons can ‘in
no circumstances renounce in part or entirety the rights secured to them in the Conventions.’40 These have been referred to as ‘non-disposal clauses’ by Peters; indicators clarifying the intention of the Contracting Parties to indeed lay down individual rights directly by the Conventions themselves, not only after domestic enactments by the contracting parties.41 Even though the power to renounce legal positions (rights) has been

34

Articles such as Art. 7 and 8 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 give protected persons explicit rights. Prior to that, in the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of
War, the concept of “rights” appears in several provisions of the Convention, such as arts. 42 and 62.
35
Zegveld (2003) p.503
36
As an example, Article 6 of the second Geneva Convention addresses the wounded, sick and shipwrecked persons with the right not to be adversely affected by any special agreement between the High
Contracting Parties, and not to have their rights conferred by the Convention restricted. Other articles
providing individuals with rights are articles such as Article 7 of the GC I, Articles 7, 14, 84, 105 and 130
of the GC III, Articles 5, 7, 8, 27, 38, 80 and 146 of the GC IV, Articles 44(5), 45(3), 75 and 85(4) of
1977 AP I; and Article 6(2) of 1977 AP II.

considered as evidence of these positions actually belonging to that person, this logic
should be overlooked in this situation. The reason behind conferring protected persons
rights accompanied by non-disposal clauses i.e. not allowing the protected person decide themselves when the provisions should be applied or not, was to limit a state’s possibilities to interfere and exercise their sovereignty. Since the persons concerned are
typically put under pressure to renounce their rights, the non-disposal clauses would be
in place to take the incentive away from states from exercising coercion e.g. with prisoners of war.42
National courts have addressed the question on individual rights granted by IHL. In the
Bridge of Varvarin case by a German civil court in Bonn the Court held that in contrast
to conferring rights, IHL offers ‘protection’ to the individual.43 The Court compared
IHL to human rights law conventions, asserting that there are no similar provisions in
IHL granting an individual a procedural right to obtain compensation for the consequences of an armed conflict. In the Netherlands, the Amsterdam District Court, while
rejecting the applicant claim, recognized the possibility of tracing individual rights from
the rules of IHL, although confining the right to personally invoke those rights.44 In
general, the difficulty before national courts has risen with the recognition of the right to
present a claim towards a state responsible for violations of international humanitarian
law.45 Quénivet argues that the assertion of the civil court in Bonn ignores the existing,
although few, legal opportunities to obtain redress on the national level, referring to e.g.
to the growing number of individuals seeking redress of IHL violations nationally under
human rights provisions.46
As developments towards a more victim-centric approach to reparations are yet to be
properly detected and pronounced upon by the courts, the instruments providing guidance and presentiment of the direction the law is headed, are growingly recognising the
individual.47 As an example, Evans argues that instruments such as the Basic Principles

12
and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Violations of
International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law clearly aim to merge IHL and human rights law and stress the importance of and the obligation to implement domestic
reparations for victims of armed conflicts.48 Considering the growing voice according to
which IHL must be interpreted in the light of the development of international law in
the field of human rights49, the question of the secondary right to reparation and its existence in IHL deserves an inspection.

2.2

IHL secondary right to reparations and claims under IHL

If it can be concluded that individuals enjoy primary rights under IHL, as a natural consequence of that, the violation of those rights entitles them to the secondary right to reparation under international law.50 A party is responsibility to provide compensation for a
breach of its obligations under IHL was explicitly laid down in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.51 A similar requirement
is articulated in Article 91 of Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.52 Each of
the Conventions establishes that no High Contracting Party shall absolve itself or any
other High Contracting Party in respect of grave breaches of the Conventions.53 Given
the PCIJ statement in the Chorzow Factory case54, Gillard notes that the obligation to
make reparations automatically arises, without a need to be explicitly spelled in a convention. The rule, according to scholars, represents customary international law and the
accepted principle of state responsibility, which is also recognised as customary international humanitarian law by the ICRC.55 Although the Hague Convention and the Additional Protocol I use the word compensation, reparation for IHL violations may take
different and multiple forms, envisaged in other IHL conventions.56
Who was originally meant to be the beneficiary entitled to compensation according to
article 3 of the Hague Convention of 1907 has been widely discussed. In accordance

with a less prevalent view, Kalshoven has argued that the traveaux préparatoires of Article 3 of the Hague Convention IV prove that the provision had originally been intended to address a state’s liability to compensate individual persons for their losses incurred
as a direct consequence of detrimental contact with its armed forces.57 He sees civilians
as the sole benefactors of the article because it seems unlikely that the article would
have been meant to cover all acts contradicting the provisions. Since it seems highly
unlikely that article 3 was designed to cover combatants’ complaints, say, of forbidden
methods of warfare, it seems justifiable to assume the enemy and neutral civilians as the
intended benefactors of the article.58 According to Kalshoven, the text of the Convention goes even further when considering the annexed regulations and the intent behind
them. Articles 52 and 53 of the Regulations59 refer to the obligation of a hostile power
to pay indemnities in respect of requisitions demanded from the civilian population for
the necessities of the army occupation, at the conclusion of peace. He highlights that
neither of these provisions refer to any unlawful conduct but in contrast seem to deal
with situations where the requisitions were in place. This would point to an early attempt to restrain the enemy army’s possibility to freely ”live off the land” without compensation.60 Even though the regulations are not considered as the letter of the law, the
intent to address individuals can be detected from them, as they are a complementary
part of the Convention.61
ICJ Advisory Opinion on Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian territory of 2004 however affirmed the duty of a state to provide
restitution and compensation for individuals having suffered as a result of the construction of the wall.62 In the operative part of the Advisory Opinion, the Court held that Israel had an obligation to provide reparation for all damage caused by the construction of
the wall, as a result of the violations of international law.63 The Court identified the
beneficiaries of the reparations as it held that Israel had the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused “to all the natural and legal persons concerned”.64 Gaeta
points out that the Court had admittedly not specified that the obligation for reparations
specifically stemmed from the violations of the rules of IHL, the construction of the

wall being unlawful under various rules of international law.65 The failure of the Court
to clarify the violations entailing the obligation would only mean that the Court found
the matter irrelevant, since the obligation to repair follows naturally from the illegality
of the Israeli conduct under the rules of international law, including specific rules of
IHL.66 No basis for treaty claim can, however, be derived from the ruling of the Court
as has been demonstrated by case law. In 2007 the ICJ Bosnia Genocide case provided
significantly less clarity on state obligations to provide reparations when not according
monetary compensation, based on the lack of a causal nexus between the failure by Serbia to comply with its obligation to prevent genocide and the death of 7000 men in Srebrenica.67 The International Court of Justice has also taken the position that states, rather than individuals, are the beneficiaries of the provision and the ones having standing
to lodge claims.68 This has been, according to Modirzahed, the approach also preferred
by IHL lawyers69 and some national courts.70 The Court has been criticized for inconsistency in its jurisprudence and taking steps back due to the case.71
A great portion of scholars, prefer the traditional reading of the Hague Convention of
1907 and remain of the opinion that since the wording of the document does not address
individuals, they in fact do not have direct claims against an enemy state. The relevant
practice proving the contrary remains scarce.72 Reference to the open phrasing of Article 3 of the Hague Convention IV and API article 91 has been made in order to justify
interpreting the norm in light of recent developments in international law, especially the
emergence of international human rights law and the growing recognition of the individual as a subject of international law.73 The individualised reading of the provisions
would according to this view, not represent an illegitimate development of the law
crafted by judges, but would rather be considered a legitimate dynamic interpretation of
the law.74 Dynamism in the interpretation of international law is a relevant but often
contentious factor in international case law. Distinguishing between the letter of the law

(‘lex lata’) and the law that ought to be (‘lex ferenda’) is not simple since “there is always an international law in the process of formation.”75
The humanitarian law treaties applicable in non-international armed conflicts are silent
on reparation.76 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it
lies in the nature of non-international armed conflicts that the approaches to reparations
available in international armed conflicts are not automatically available in noninternational contexts, and that particularly in non-international armed conflicts the victims suffering in their own states usually have access to justice and a possibility to claim
reparations through their domestic courts.77 The ICRC has however highlighted the
growing amount of state practice showing that the rule to provide reparation for the loss
or damage occurred would be considered a customary norm, therefore applying in both
international and non-international armed conflicts.78
Many arguments speaking for an emerging individual right to reparation under IHL rely
on the fact that, although human rights and humanitarian law stem from different historical and doctrinal roots, their common denominator is the principle of humanity that is
inherent to every individual. One should raise the question why the same individual can
enforce his rights embedded in human rights treaties but not in humanitarian law treaties. Though the arguments for the right of an individual to claim reparation exist and
can be justified, the needed acknowledgements by relevant judicial authorities are still
lacking in practice.
Some progressive questions about a merger between IHL and IHRL have already been
presented, which may have overread the current state of law. However, some interplay
certainly has already occurred, concerning both international and non-international
armed conflicts.79 Considering the nature of contemporary armed conflicts, the victims
have sought alternative options in accessing reparations. Both Additional Protocols
acknowledge the application of human rights in armed conflicts,80 and while the ICRC
did not follow this course in the early stages of the discussion,81 it later accepted that

“human rights continue to apply concurrently with IHL in time of armed conflict.”82
The position that human rights do not generally cease to apply in armed conflicts is now
broadly established and has been confirmed by the ICJ with respect to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)83 as well as by regional human rights
instruments accordingly.84 The details of the interaction between the two bodies of law
interaction remain under discussion.85

2.3

Reparations in human rights law applicable in Africa

Human rights instruments applicable in Africa contain references to reparations. Article
2(3) of the ICCPR puts the states under an obligation to provide an effective remedy to
any person whose rights have been violated.86 Furthermore, Article 2(1) of the Covenant obliges the states parties “to respect and ensure to all individuals (…) the rights
recognized (…) without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language,
religion political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” The only reference to reparations (the word ‘compensation’) is found in articles
9(5) and 14(6) in the contexts of unlawful arrest, detention and conviction.87 Though the
ICCPR does not contain a general reparation clause, the Human Rights Committee has,
relying on Article 2(3) recognized that this right entails a duty of the state to grant reparation, in the forms of e.g. restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction.88
Recommendations based on article 2(3)(a) of the ICCPR on awarding compensation as
forms of reparations are also found in several concluding observations of the Committee.89
Though the Human Rights Committee has in its General Comment No. 31 affirmed that
reparation is a central part of an effective remedy, it has maintained a rather narrow interpretation of article 2(3) in individual petitions, and has not developed remedies in

line with the General Comment.90 The Concluding observations of the Committee have,
however, provided a platform to pronounce on the positive obligation of the state enshrined in the ICCPR: under certain circumstances, i.e. disappearances, a failure to ensure Covenant rights such as required by Article 2 may result to violations by the state
parties, as a result of a failure to take appropriate action or to exercise due diligence to
prevent, punish investigate or redress the harm caused by private actors.91
The Human Rights Committee has referred to reparations in the context of an armed
conflict in several Concluding observations, and has interpreted remedies quite broadly.
In its review of Bosnia and Hertzegovina, the Committee noted that the failure of the
state to investigate the cause and circumstance of death and provide information on the
burial of the victims may amount, among other provisions, to a violation of article 2(3).
What was to be done according to the Committee was to “take immediate steps to investigate”. The Committee also requested the finalization of a missing person database, and
a prompt commencement of payments to the families of the deceased.92 Not only did the
Committee consider reparations to be awarded to the family members of the victims, it
also required another measures to be commenced to prevent similar violations from
happening and to better monitor the situation of missing persons in the state. The link
between reparations and effective investigations was highlighted by the Committee also
in i.e. on its Concluding observation on the Democratic Republic of the Congo in
2006.93 The Committee’s observations on the Central African Republic also highlight
the congruence of human rights law and humanitarian law. It notes the practical implementation of effective remedies awarded to the “victims of serious violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law”, “including the right to as full compensation
and reparations as possible”.94
Somewhat similarly to the ICCPR, the African Charter does not have an explicit article
on the right to reparation.95 Article 7(1)(a) provides that everyone has the right to have
his cause heard, including “a right to an appeal to competent national organ against acts
of violating his fundamental rights as recognised and guaranteed by convictions, laws,
regulations and customs in force.” However, the African Commission has interpreted

18
the protection awarded by Article 7(1) as wider than the explicit wording, pointing towards reparations, by stating that
“The protection afforded by Article 7 is not limited to the protection of the rights of arrested and
detained persons but encompasses the rights of every individual to access the relevant judicial
bodies competent to have their causes heard and be granted adequate relief.”96

Other cases could also be seen as evidence of the African Commission’s willingness to
read the African Charter as a document providing for the right to reparation. In Embga
Mekongo v Cameroon, the victim was entitled to reparations, the value of which was
however to be determined in accordance with the Cameroonian legislation.97 In Malawi
African Association & Others v Mauritania, the African Commission ordered the Mauritanian government to e.g. pay compensatory benefits to the dependents of the victims.98 According to Sarkin, this, in addition to the other existing human rights instruments and international law on state responsibility, presents a well-established legal
basis for reparations for victims of human rights and humanitarian abuses in Africa.99
As the African Commission has noted in its General Comment No. 4, the right to redress encompasses “the right to an effective remedy and to adequate, effective and
comprehensive reparation”.100
Musila presents as a possibility that the drafters of the African Charter could have considered it superfluous to include a right that would be seen as an implied, self-evident
right, reflecting the principle ubi jus ibi remedium: for the violation of every right, there
must be a remedy.101 The challenging political realities prevailing at the time of the
Charter’s adoption have also been presented as a reason for the ‘omission’.102 Musila
however supports the arguments criticizing the jurisprudence of the African Commission for ‘situational’ interpretations and the lack of theorisation103, as well as the lack of

The African Commission has according to Musila (2006 p.459) elaborated the general state obligations

19
connections104 between the Charter and norms on the international level,105 creating
ambiguity on the victim’s position in terms of reparation claims.
From another point of view, the lack of willingness from the African Commission’s side
to address reparations for a long time, and the continuous vagueness of its reasonings,
speaks for a contrary, or at least a slightly different argument to Musila’s.106 According
to Ssenyonjo, the African Commission for several years, instead or ordering specific
actions to be taken by the states, intentionally promoted a ’positive dialogue’, leading to
fairly conciliatory resolutions.107 This is demonstrated by cases such as RADDHO v
Zambia,108 where the African Commission decided not to afford victims an adequate
remedy, but to “continue efforts to pursue an amicable resolution.”109 Ssenyonjo however concludes that the African Commission has over the years made, despite the lack
of an express mandate, significant improvements in efforts to award remedies to victims
of human rights violations. Even in the absence of a consistent approach, it has made
some notable non-monetary recommendations.110 It has also acknowledged the significance of monetary awards, in the form of ’just and adequate’ or ’fair and equitable’
compensation, to victims of human rights violations against several states, providing a
basis to develop a more consistent approach.111 In the absence of proof of what the intentions of the drafters of the Charter were, it could be reasonable to assume that what
was too difficult to agree on at the time of the drafting, was intentionally left out. The
inconsistency of the jurisprudence and the lack of reference to reparation-related instruments in cases provide additional evidence, pointing towards the difficulty of circumstances during the time of drafting, as well as in the 2000’s and 2010’s. The fact
that the African Commission for a long time utilized an approach promoting dialogue

104

See Jawara para.33-34. The Commission simply pronounced that the local rules must be applied in
alignment with article 7. Musila (2006 p.459) states that the Commission has not, in any of its decisions
or elsewhere, clarified the broad principles or what specific remedies would be applicable generally under
the Charter. Where reference has been made to international law, this has mostly been general, as in Amnesty International and Others v Sudan.

and avoiding the topic of reparations could be seen as a continuum for the situation at
the time of drafting: in volatile circumstances the African Commission might have kept
the strategy of still not pronouncing on topics too controversial. This would, however,
not point towards an intention to rule out the possibility of reparations.
While the African Commission for a long time struggled with pronouncing on reparations, the Human Rights Committee has also not succeeded in consistency. As a most
consistent element in the Committee’s jurisprudence, it has required the state party to
publish the view of the Committee when violations have been found.112 It has also from
time to time used terms such as ‘full reparation’ or ‘adequate reparation’, yet without
great coherence.113 As the Committee lacks the mandate to order financial awards in
individual cases, it has approached reparations more broadly. Its orders have also in
individual petitions considered practical action, relating to i.e. providing information, or
‘compensation’ for the anguish suffered by the families of the victims.114 Whereas the
African Commission took its time to get to a point where it considered necessary to start
pronouncing on reparations, the approach of the Human Rights Committee, though
clearly established in its General Comment, has not greatly contributed to the actual
realisation of reparations for victims either.
A fairly little attention has focused on an African instrument particularly pronouncing
on women’s rights in an armed conflict. The Maputo Protocol115 requires states to “provide for appropriate remedies to any woman whose rights or freedoms . . . have been
violated”, departing from the approach of the African Charter by clearly pronouncing on
reparations.116 Article 4(f) obliges the states that have ratified the Protocol to “establish
mechanisms and accessible services for effective information, rehabilitation and reparation for victims of violence against women.”117 Article the 11 of Maputo Protocol particularly addresses the protection of civilians, including women, and calls for the states
parties to the Protocol to “undertake to protect “…” against all forms of violence, rape
and other forms of sexual exploitation, … “ in armed conflicts.118 Article 11(2) of the

Protocol refers to the state obligation to act “in accordance with the obligations incumbent upon them under international humanitarian law” to protect civilians.119 The instrument directly refers to IHL in certain provisions, which may be the reason the times
they have been applied have been so few.
The African Court has an express mandate to award reparation, by making “appropriate
orders to remedy the violation, including the payment of fair compensation or reparation.”120 As of today, only nine121 of the 30 states parties122 to the Protocol have made
the declaration to recognize the competence of the Court to receive cases from NGOs
and individuals. The referral of cases to the African Court when necessary, for instance
in situations dealing with grave violations of human rights, or when a state has not
complied with its resolution, would be another way of strengthening and clarifying victims’ rights.123 Being at a very early stages of its operations, not a lot can be said about
its effectiveness in terms of reparations. Though the Protocol changes the situation normatively by expressly providing for certain forms of remedies,124 reaching a greater
level of clarity will take time. Even in the absence of a consistent approach with reparations, the creation of a clear mandate for the African Court, in addition to the African
Commission’s growing amount of reparation recommendations, speaks for a willingness to strengthen the position of an individual as a receiver of reparations on the continent.
To conclude, as a larger, favourable context for the existence of a right to reparation
within the African regional system, Evans highlights the African Commission’s interpretation of Article 55 of the Charter. The non-existence of a reparations provision has,
according to Evans, permitted NGOs, both national and international, to lodge cases to
the African Commission, allowing for the review of cases relating to large-scale human
rights abuses. This has been possible since the Commission has interpreted the provision in article 55 on “communications other than those of States parties” to refer to the
possibility of receiving claims from NGOs and individuals as well.125 At least 14 coun119

tries in Africa have prescribed reparation initiatives.126 While this indicates and reinforces the acceptance of the imperative of reparation, the design and implementation of
reparation regimes has often been fraught with challenges. At least partially due to this,
multiple African countries, such as Rwanda, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Mozambique
have drawn use of local or indigenous justice mechanisms, instead of or in addition to
the courts, that often times had mandates concerning reparative measures. While the
lack of a reparations clause may even out the road for cases of a larger scale, the initial
problem, especially relevant to the victims of armed conflicts still stands. When violations are large scale, the need for resources enabling the enforcement of reparations is
just as large.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IHL AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN ARMED CONFLICTS

3.1

The application of human rights law in armed conflicts

While international humanitarian law itself does not provide an individual with a clear
and direct lane through which seek reparations for violations during an armed conflict,
human rights bodies, offering an individual possibilities to seek remedy, may be helpful
in addressing events that constitute violations of IHL, but are also breaches of human
rights law. As both the African Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights contain provisions that have been interpreted as providing for the right
to reparation, the individual has an actual remedy. The issue and uncertainty of the outcome, however, lies in the applicability of human rights law in armed conflicts, and the
way in which human rights bodies are interpreting the relationship between IHL and
human rights law.
Identifying conflict-related gender-based violence is not necessarily straightforward
since violence of such nature takes place also in the absence of conflicts. Making the
connection between individual gender-based violations and conflict-related violence
such as the use of rape as a systematic tool of warfare requires substantially more evidence than identifying individual crimes. Since proving the systematic nature of this
form of gendered violence is often difficult, the victims may reach justice more effectively if the connection of the violations to the hostilities is not established. Since other
type of violence towards the civilian population also often affects women disproportionately, multiple violations towards civilians may possibly also be violations of gendered nature. The gendered nature of these type of offences, when it exists, may also
remain hidden. The manner in which the human rights treaty bodies have connected the
violations to the prevailing conflict and therefore affirmed the applicability of IHL affect the individual.
Chapters 3.2 and 3.3 address the issue of the relationship between IHL and human
rights law and seek to identify the ways in which the Human Rights Committee and the
African human rights bodies have applied IHL in situations of armed conflicts. Though
that was not necessarily meant to take place, ways to harmonize their co-existence and
application must be sought for.127 In situations where there is overlap between IHL and

127

Droege (2008) p. 501-502.

24
IHRL, their relationship has in general been interpreted through the concept of complementarity and the principle of lex specialis.128

3.2

Complementarity of IHL and human rights law

Complementarity means that human rights law and humanitarian law, being based on
the same principles and values, can influence and reinforce each other, while not contradicting each other.129 According to Iguyovwe, human rights law, being broader in its
scope of application, can sometimes benefit from the more narrowly applicable rules of
IHL. On the other hand, the increasingly specific body of jurisprudence of human rights
law can influence IHL that has less interpretative jurisprudence at hand.130 The jurisprudence on reparations created by human rights bodies serves as an example.
Complementarity reflects the method of interpretation enshrined in Article 31(3)(c) of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, according to which when a norm is interpreted, ”any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties” shall be taken into account. It has been suggested that this principle, also referred to as the principle of systemic integration, enshrines the idea of understanding
international law as a comprehensive and coherent system, where different sets of
norms co-exist in harmony, without controversy.131 This would reinforce the possibility
of interpreting IHL in the light of human rights and the opposite way around.132
In many cases IHL and human rights law do not contradict each other, but rather regulate different aspects of a situation, or in a mutually reinforcing way, provide regulations for it in more or less detail. There are, however, limits on the areas of mutual reinforcement, one of which being the right to remedy and reparation.133 All major human
rights instruments have a form of individual mechanism for receiving complaints, but
humanitarian law does not directly provide such a channel, as established in the previous chapter. Droege, however, points out that the increasing awareness of the application of human rights in armed conflicts as well as an increasing call for transparency
and accountability in military operations can potentially have an impact on the way certain rights under IHL are understood, reflecting the principle of complementarity.134 For

an individual, this would possibly mean greater coherence and less friction in the rights
granted to them by the two bodies of law. It seems clear that the provisions in human
rights law granting the individual a right to reparations may complement the IHL regime applicable during armed conflicts. Complementarity does not, however, clearly
provide a solution to situations where these two regimes seemingly contradict each other, and in that way, affect the rights of an individual.

3.3

Lex specialis

Another principle of interpretation can be detected from international jurisprudence.
According to Hathaway et al, it is useful to distinguish between three different approaches to the applicability of human rights law in armed conflicts: one in which international humanitarian law prevails in cases of conflicts between the two bodies of law;
another in which human rights prevail; and, finally, one in which the more specific law
in the particular context and question at hand applies, the lex specialis principle.135 The
principle has been used by the ICJ in its advisory opinions on the Legality of the Threat
or Use of Nuclear Weapons case136 and the Wall case137 and reiterated in the DRC v
Uganda case138, to illustrate the relationship between the two bodies of law. The ICJ
pronouncements on this principle do provide significant interpretative tools and guidelines in the relatively blank starting position, but there is a large amount of academic
writings proposing that the pronouncements in fact bring up additional questions and
are not practically helpful when applying the law in cases of dealing with the relationship between human rights law and IHL,139 especially when breaking it down to a level
of an individual. Whether lex specialis only means that the special provision prevails
over the general, or that the former actually displaces the latter, is not clear.140 Whether
an individual has suffered a breach of his or her rights granted by human rights instruments during an armed conflict, is suddenly a less straightforward question.
Hampson makes three different propositions for the interpretation of lex specialis. It
seems that what the ICJ had first meant, was that where both IHL and human rights law
are applicable, priority should be given to IHL. She suggests that the ICJ meant for
the human rights body to make a finding based on IHL, while expressing it in the lan135

26
guage of human rights law.141 This interpretation, however, does not provide practical
guidance on the application of the principle.142 An alternative would be to assume that
IHL prevails where it contains an express provision addressing a similar field to that of
a human rights provision. The problem with this interpretation is that while IHL affects
some human rights law rules significantly, it leaves some provisions almost totally unaffected. The question would then be to what extent the conflict context would affect the
applicability of human rights law, when there is no express provision. Human rights
treaty bodies would in this case have quite a lot of freedom in applying the limitation
clauses many human rights provisions contain. The role of customary law is unclear in
this situation, and the lack of treaty provisions applicable to non-international armed
conflicts would in some cases lead to irrational outcomes.143 Yet another option would
be to interpret lex specialis according to the issue at hand. In that case, where IHL provides a provision regarding a situation, such as a fair trial, but does not further specify
that, human rights law would be applicable, and would address the aspects of the right
not covered by IHL. An obvious issue to this interpretation is the question, whether only
treaty provisions determine the content of human rights law, or would other pronouncements, such as the concluding observations of treaty bodies and their General
Comments, have a place in specifying the IHL norm in question. 144 Assuming that the
relationship will be formulated by means of litigation seems an arbitrary method, since
it is not exclusively an inter-state affair but also an affair of the state and those within its
jurisdiction.145
Though stemming from the idea of complementarity, the principle of systemic integration has also been discussed in relation to lex specialis. It has been suggested that the
ICJ, in the case Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, in fact did not resort
to lex specialis. Since it does not as a matter of fact set aside human rights law, it could
be said to have rather applied the VCLT article 31(3)(c) in considering all the international rules that might be relevant to the interpretation of a certain norm, and in this way

142
See Arnold, Roberta – Quénivet, Noëlle (eds.) International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights
Law: Towards a New Merger in International Law. For example, it could be that once IHL is applicable,
human rights body would have to base its decisions solely on that. In that case, where IHL does not have
anything to say on a matter, such as the right not to be discriminated based on gender, there would be no
violation. This interpretation where IHL displaces the applicability of human rights law would, according
to Hampson (2008, p.560) however, be contrary to the ruling of the ICJ that IHRL remains applicable.
143
Hampson (2008) p.560. Detentions provide an illustrative example. The treaty law on NIACs is silent
on permissible grounds for detention, which according to this interpretation would mean treaty bodies
were able to apply human rights law in those situations since IHL is not specific, but IHL where is does
have a say, such as the protection of certain objects crucial to survival, such as food.

applying the principle of systemic integration.146 According to Todeschini, the ICJ uses
IHL to give meaning to the convention article in question.147 Many human rights bodies,
including the Human Rights Committee, have frequently employed the principle.148
Out of the three lex specialis interpretations, Hampson proposes the second alternative
could be the best compromise, but emphasises the need for agreement between the
states and the human rights bodies on which way to go about the problem.149 The first
option suggested by Hampson, giving priority to IHL, could also in principle work as a
simple solution. Human rights bodies would therefore need to thoroughly investigate
the areas of horizontal overlap between the human rights norms and IHL. The issue regarding non-international armed conflicts would be one of the most urgent ones to resolve. It is suggested that the solution to lex specialis issue should be one that has the
ability to be applied at the moment of decision by those responsible for it, or it should
be abandoned altogether.150 Interpreting the relationships according to the issue at hand,
regardless of the fact that it would require the human rights bodies to develop a solid
jurisprudence on the matter, would be a starting point for moving forward in the matter.
Even though litigation is slow, the most frequent questions brought in front of the human rights bodies would slowly start being addressed, and the paralysis caused by inability to find a perfect solution would be avoided.
In practical terms, the extent to which it is possible for human rights bodies to take other
international law into account, depends on whether the human rights treaties in question
include derogation clauses or whether they refer to other sources of international law.151
As covered, even in the absence of a reference to other international treaties, article
31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention plays a role.152 The jurisprudence of the Human
rights Committee and the African Commission and the Court will be addressed through
these three lenses. The interpretations of treaty bodies have been divided into three categories; derogation clauses, references to other sources of international law, and specific
references to article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention.

Human rights bodies addressing the relationship between IHL
and international human rights law

3.4.1

Derogation clauses

Whether an individual has access to reparations based on human rights violations naturally depends on whether certain violations can be read into violations of human rights,
or violations at all under the circumstances. Derogations from human rights obligations
enshrined in treaties are permissible only to the extent to which they are inevitably required based on the situation and do not in any other way conflict with the state’s other
international obligations. They are also only acceptable when they do not involve discrimination solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social
origin.153 Bearing this in mind that gender-based violence, often taking the form of discrimination, is unlikely to be considered a norm from which derogations are allowed.
To set the stage for other forms of interpreting the relationship between IHL and human
rights law during armed conflicts, a brief review of derogations is however in place. In
general, derogations lead to occasions where human rights law and IHL interact, and the
positions taken by the human rights bodies may assist in interpreting the relationship
between the bodies of law in general. The ICCPR allows for derogations when it comes
to certain rights in times of public emergency, while some rights, e.g. article 6, the right
to life, are not subject to derogations under any conditions. Article 14 of the ICCPR, the
article referring to compensation, is not among the non-derogable articles listed in article 4. The African Charter does not in general allow derogations, based on which the
Commission has deduced that the rights enshrined in the Charter remain operational
during armed conflict.154 A number of cases have given the African Commission a
chance to conclude and affirm that the states are never allowed to derogate from their
human rights obligations.155
Since the ICCPR prohibits e.g. arbitrary killings but does not define ‘arbitrary’, the
meaning of the word could be affected by the existence of an armed conflict, even when
153

Viljoen (2014) p. 312. As an example, in the Amnesty International case concerning Sudan, the African Commission emphasised that restricting human rights could not be a solution to national difficulties,
while also noting that when Sudan was going through a civil war, civilians in certain areas were especially vulnerable, providing that the state must take all possible measures to ensure their rightful treatment in
accordance with international humanitarian law. See Amnesty International & Others v Sudan paras. 79,
50.
155
See e.g. Chad Mass Violations case, para 21, Media Rights Agenda case para 67.
154

29
there is no possibility to derogate. The Human Rights Committee could, according to
Hampson, still use IHL to determine whether there was a violation of human rights law,
without the question of derogation.156 Practically, and similarly to the ICCPR, the Charter does not e.g. in Article 4 provide a definition for what constitutes ‘arbitrary’ when it
comes to the deprivation of life.157 General Comment No. 3 of the African Commission
on the Right to Life, however provides the scope of the prohibition on the ‘arbitrary’
deprivation of life and specifically refers to armed conflicts by stating that during those
times the right to life needs to be interpreted with regard to the rules of IHL.158 Even
without officially allowing for derogations, the African Charter does allow room for
interpretation. When it comes to arbitrary deprivation of life, gendered violence, e.g.
violence towards women usually takes the form of civilian casualties. When IHL rules
for targeting are followed and the military activity leads to civilian victims, it could be
assumed that no violation has occurred.
Considering derogations as a factor related to a right to reparation is relevant due to the
differing regimes in IACs and NIACs. IHL regulates international armed conflicts
(IAC) differently to non-international armed conflicts (NIAC), which may in practice
result in different levels of protection to an individual in cases where derogations invite
interpretations from the IHL regime that currently stands. The Human Rights Committee addressed Article 6 of the ICCPR in its General Comment No. 36 in situations of
armed conflict, in a rather general and unsatisfactory way. Todeschini however mentions that the Committee’s reluctance or failure to distinguish between IACs and NIACs
in General Comment No. 36 did not in this case create too much confusion. Since the
IAC rules governing targeting, namely the principles of distinction, proportionality and
precaution, while namely applying in IACs have attained a customary status and therefore apply in NIACs as well, the situation from the point of view of an individual would
not be substantially different.159 Violations of gendered nature would typically fall into
a category of violations that would in this case not be affected by the characterization of
the conflict. More important would be identifying the conflict nexus of the violations.
The use of force against a person could either relate to the armed conflict, or, in the absence of a nexus to it, be governed under the paradigm of law enforcement. The fact that
human rights law continues to govern law enforcement, even when a conflict occurs, is

relevant especially when it comes to low intensity NIACs and NIACs taking place only
in certain parts of the territory of a state.160 According to Todeschini, General Comment
No. 36 does not succeed in separating these two paradigms; in fact by failing to differentiate the paradigms of law enforcement and the conduct of hostilities, it risks giving
states more leeway in using lethal force according to IHL rules, while law enforcement
paradigm should be the one applicable.161 In this case, the rights of an individual suffering any kind of violence are at stake, if NIAC rules are applied when no real connection
to the armed conflict exists. This violence can most often disproportionately affect
women and children. In terms of reparation clauses, the law enforcement paradigm
gives an individual a more uncomplicated channel to reparations, since human rights
law provisions are at place without IHL influence.
In General Comment No. 29 the Human Rights Committee stated that even rights that
are potentially derogable have a non-derogable core.162 According to Hampson, this
would likely mean that human rights bodies would treat rights with a close relationship
to a non-derogable norm in fact also non-derogable. Todeschini presents the same argument by highlighting General Comment No. 29 as remarkable since the Human
Rights Committee makes a pronouncement on IHL’s role in helping to prevent the
abuse of a state’s emergency powers regarding derogations, acting as an outer boundary.163 Additionally, the Committee used IHL to limit the states’ abilities to derogate
from certain ICCPR provisions164, which are not listed as non-derogable norms in the
convention per se.165 The Committee seemed to rely on the fact that IHL recognises fair
trial rights in armed conflicts166 and maintained that states are not to derogate from the
‘constitutive elements’ of this right even in other situations of emergency.167 Todeschini
refers to this as IHL providing and additional layer of protection of certain human
rights.168 Article 14 of the ICCPR enshrines similar rights granted to the individual, i.e.
14(1) equality before the courts and tribunals and 14(2) the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Leaning on this interpretation, it would seem unlikely that the
Human Rights Committee would due to the lack of a an explicit right to reparation in

31
IHL, limit the rights enshrined in article 14, when it has previously used IHL to protect
the individual.
Though the interpretive effect of IHL on human rights in derogations during different
types of conflicts does not necessarily differ, the protective impact of IHL is not similar
without exception when it comes to conflicts of different nature. The Human Rights
Committee’s General Comment No. 35 has sparked conversation since its approach
there can be seen as one implicitly differentiating between international and noninternational armed conflicts regarding detention: a measure not directly regulated in
non-international armed conflicts. The Committee in General Comment No. 35 states
that
“During international armed conflict, substantive and procedural rules of international humanitarian law remain applicable and limit the ability to derogate, thereby helping to mitigate the
169

risk of arbitrary detention.”

which has been suggested to infer that the issue under consideration only relates to international armed conflicts.170 Todeschini, however, challenges the argument by saying
that the reference to IHL as a limit to derogation powers should be read while also considering General Comment No. 29, where the Committee has supposedly not made a
distinction. The emphasis on the convergent relationship between IHL and the ICCPR
should be seen as indicators of their complementary relationship, and the pronouncements not as differentiating conflicts specifically.171 Todeschini does note that the question of the regulation of internment in non-international armed conflicts remains unclear, as it is not clearly settled whether IHL expressly regulates internment in them.172
Hampson highlights that human rights bodies have been applying human rights law in
cases of killings during NIACs in several cases where the existence of an international
armed conflict has not been acknowledged, and have not received criticism for it.173
Human rights bodies have even used human rights law in its entirety in cases of noninternational armed conflict, when there have been no derogations.174 Detecting the impact of the cases considering derogations on reparation provisions in human rights in169

struments has not properly been touched upon. However, considering the Human Rights
Committee’s approach to limit the possibility to derogate on certain norms would point
towards a strengthened position for the individual; considering Hampson’s take, especially in non-international armed conflicts.

3.4.2

References to other sources of international law

Articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter explicitly allow the African Commission to
have regard to other sources of international law, more specifically to ‘draw inspiration
from international law on human and peoples’ rights’175 and “take into consideration, as
subsidiary measures (…) consistent with international norms on Human and Peoples’
Rights, customs generally accepted as law, general principles of law recognised by African States as well as legal precedents and doctrine.”176 In Amnesty International, while
not finding a violation directly in terms of humanitarian law, the African Commission
used IHL language when it identified a violation of the right to life under the African
Charter in the killing of ’unarmed civilians’.177 The African Commission’s approach in
the case is part of the reason why it has sometimes been detected having a human
rights-based approach. Amnesty International as well as Chad Mass Violations dealt
with situations of civil war and, hence, non-international rather than international armed
conflicts, where humanitarian law is least worked out as a matter of law. While serious
violations of human rights were found to have taken place during the armed conflict in
Chad, the African Commission was silent on the states responsibility to provide reparation measures.178 The contribution of the case has, according to Evans, been the affirmation of the positive duty of the state to prevent violations by non-state actors,179 being
consistent with other international treaty bodies and regional human rights systems180
and furthermore strengthening the position of an individual victim in a NIAC. The African Commission has multiple times also emphasised e.g. that the successor governments inherit the previous government’s obligations, “including the responsibility for
the previous government’s mismanagement.”181

33
The Human Rights Committee has generally avoided the use of the lex specialis formulation and has instead found that “both spheres of law are complementary, not mutually
exclusive”.182 According to Todeschini, the Human Rights Committee has in its General
Comment No. 31 taken a complementary approach, considering IHL and human rights
law as mutually reinforcing bodies of law.183 The Committee there rejects the idea that
the applicability of IHL excludes the concurrent applicability of human rights law but
fails to explain how the complementarity approach would work in practice.184 Concluding observations of the Committee also support the interpretation that the convergence
of IHL and human rights law is acknowledged in protecting certain rights,185 as discussed in 3.1. Complementary approach has been affirmed also in General Comment
No. 35.186 No specific examples of the effect of IHL norms on the reparation provision
in human rights law emerge from the Human Rights Committee’s jurisprudence and
highlighting the complementarity approach is not bringing new clarity on the issue.
Since complementary has been acknowledged with an aim to protect rights, one could
assume the references to complementarity in the Human Rights Committee’s jurisprudence would at least not seek to weaken the reparatory dimension of human rights law.
As another way of referring to other sources of international law, the African Commission has in some cases sought ‘interpretative guidance’ from IHL, though only finding
violations of human rights law.187 Concerning the question of occupation and its effects
on the rights of the civilian population in the DRC case, the African Commission engaged more explicitly with IHL, while only finding violations of the African Charter as
such. It did acknowledge that the alleged violations by the armed forces fell “within the
province of humanitarian law”, holding that the events were covered by the Geneva
Convention and their Additional Protocols.188 The Commission was therefore most likely again drawing inspiration from these “general principles of law recognized by African states” by the virtue of articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter.189 Alternatively, if
the Commission intended to incorporate IHL within a Charter right, a much more detailed legal analysis on the rights would have been expected.190 The African Commission has, to some extent similarly to the Human Rights Committee, in its General
Comment No. 3 highlighted the conflict nexus of the use of force and stated that

“International humanitarian law on the conduct of hostilities must only be applied during an armed conflict and where the use of force is part of the armed conflict. In all other situations of violence, including
internal disturbances, tensions or riots, international human rights rules governing law enforcement operations apply”.191

Whereas the approach of the Human Rights Committee was criticized for its inability to
distinguish between the paradigms of law enforcement and the conduct of hostilities, the
African Commission is here clearly, though not with abundant wording, making the
distinction. Whether the General Comment No. 3 would actually mean the African
Commission would consider it possible to read IHL into human rights, or only continue
to draw inspiration from general principles of law by the virtue of article 60 and 61, is
not completely clear only based on this.
Although articles 60 and 61 of the African Charter are often cited together,192 they refer
to different sources of international law and different ’methods’ of allowing the influence of other sources of international law to affect the interpretation of the Charter.
Viljoen points out that a distinction should be made between the two provisions. A strict
interpretation of article 60 would exclude international humanitarian law thereto, based
on which it could be assumed that the African Commission finds its mandate to rely on
humanitarian law treaties in article 61. The sources of international law where the commission finds the referred IHL treaties are ‘other general or specialised international
conventions laying down rules expressly recognised’ by AU member states and “other
conventions”, referring to treaties that do not deal with human rights.193 The Geneva
Conventions and the Additional Protocols thereto are in the situation referred to by the
Commission as ‘special international conventions’.194 Viljoen suggests that, although
the Commission did not explicitly use the term at this point, it in fact categorises the
treaties as lex specialis. The fact that the Commission did not consider the issue of
whether the relevant treaties are expressly recognised by African states (as presented in
article 61 as the second source to take into consideration), and also did not strive to clarify how and why they have gained recognition as ’general principles’ is possibly explained by the prevailing situation that a majority of African states, with the exception
of Eritrea, Angola and Somalia, are all parties to the Geneva Conventions and their Ad-

ditional Protocols.195 Ratification of the Convention is however, not a prerequisite for
interpretative recourse196 since some humanitarian law standards could be considered to
have acquired a customary law status.197 According Hailbronner, both the African
Commission and the African Court are just now starting to address questions on the
application of humanitarian law, due to which their articulations on the relationship often raise a multitude of questions. She does however suggest that due to the comparatively broad formulation of rights in the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights
(African Charter), an interpretive approach that reads international humanitarian law
into human rights law could be both ‘feasible and convincing’.198
Evidence of this can be detected in one of the most recent cases dealing with an armed
conflict, Thomas Kwoyelo v. Uganda.199 In the case, the African Commission took a
step towards what Viljoen had suggested, and now explicitly referred to lex specialis as
a principle in an event of tension between IHL and the human rights provisions in the
African Charter.200 Accordingly, for the particular case the African Commission applies
the standard of treatment specified in Common Article 3, which is generally considered
to have achieved a status of customary international law, referring to the principle of lex
specialis as the norm giving the most detailed guidance priority.201 Furthermore, it goes
on to affirm that acts taking place outside the conduct of hostilities are to be regulated
by reference to human rights law.202 On the basis of articles 60 and 61 of the African
Charter, in making reference to IHL rules, the African Commission accordingly said it
uses, instead of the Charter standards that apply in normal conditions and peace times,
the standards of the IHL rules for making a determination of the existence of violations
of the provisions of the African Charter in such situations of NIACs.203 This was a position previously stated in General Comment No.3.204 The expression ‘giving the most
detailed guidance priority’ does not yet shed light on the question, what happens in a
situation where IHL is silent. The Commission did refer to lex specialis as applicable in
situations of ‘tension’ arising from the concurrent application of the bodies of law.205
Where IHL is silent, no tension arises, and the Charter provisions on reparations can be
applied without IHL influence.

Thomas Kwoyelo v. Uganda illustrates this, since the Commission found violations of
the rights under articles 3 and 7(1)(a), and a partial violation under article 7(1)(d) of the
African Charter, and ordered the Government of Uganda to pay adequate compensation
to the victim, stating that the mode of payment of compensation should be guided by
international norms and practices relating to payment of compensatory damages.206
Both of articles 3 and 7(1)(d) were considered to be violations on their own, not by reference to IHL rules. This statement goes hand in hand with the Commission’s General
Comment 3, where it highlights the conflict nexus as a benchmark in determining
whether it is IHL or human rights law that governs the use of force against individuals.207 The African Commission here succeeds in addressing an issue that e.g. the Human Rights Commission in General Comment No. 36 did not, as stated, satisfyingly
touch upon. The reason based on which the African Commission yet again refers to both
articles is not clarified. Since it now expressly refers to lex specialis, it could be assumed that reference to article 60 is, in alignment with Viljoen, done either because it
does consider IHL conventions ‘instruments on human and people’s rights’, or due to
the large numbers of state parties to the treaties on the continent acknowledging the
standards.
The African Commission has been blunt to articulate that it will only make findings of
violations of the African Charter.208 The human rights based approach often taken by
human rights bodies is particularly well understood in non-international armed conflicts,
where the IHL provisions are not abundant. The African Commission is not facing an
easy task when pursuing to use, instead of Charter standards, the standards of IHL in
situations of NIACs, as it stated in Thomas Kwoyelo v. Uganda. Whether this may
strengthen the individual rights of civilians in NIACs in comparison with civilians in
IACs has not been further researched. It has been argued that a less developed body of
law it is not alone a reason to adopt a pure human rights based approach, but a contextspecific analysis is needed.209 The one-sided implementation of humanitarian law
through human rights bodies may entail the risk of transforming humanitarian law into a
law applicable exclusively to states.210 Although the African Commission and the African Court are mainly mandated to apply the African Charter, the Commission’s material
jurisdiction extends further than the African Charter, due to which it has the competence

to adjudicate the Maputo Protocol.211 Maputo Protocol makes specific reference to IHL
in article 11, requiring for the state parties to respect the rules of international humanitarian law that affect the population, ’particularly women’.212 Article 11 of the Maputo
Protocol will be further discussed in the following chapter.

3.4.3

References to article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention

General Comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee exemplifies the principle of
systemic integration with the statement “... more specific rules of international humanitarian law may be specially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation of Covenant
rights”213, by making implicit reference to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention.
Todeschini further notes that the Committee refrains from any reference to the lex specialis principle also in this connection.214 General Comment No. 31 further acknowledges that the ICCPR imposes a duty on States to provide domestic remedies for violations of its provisions, including the possibility to obtain full redress,215 while at the
same time, a breach of IHL that translates into a violation of the ICCPR will entitle the
individual to seek redress against a state accountable for the violation.216 In its concluding observations, the Human Rights Committee has stated that states need to make redress available for victims of human rights and IHL violations occurred during armed
conflicts.217 Similar to the African Commission’s approach based on articles 60 and 61
of the African Charter, the Human Rights Committee seems to consider IHL as interpretative inspiration in finding violations of the ICCPR.
The African Court on human and peoples’ rights has so far only dealt with one case
where it has addressed an armed conflict; the decision on provisional measures against
Libya. Though the African Court makes mention to factors violating “human rights and
international humanitarian law”218, it does not itself draw from humanitarian law. It,
however, calls on Libya to end actions violating both the African Charter and addition-

ally, ‘other international human rights instruments to which it is party’.219 Considering
the African Commission's assessment in the DRC decision, whether the African Court
considers the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols ’other international
human rights instruments’ on which it is specifically allowed to draw, seems unlikely.220 They would rather be characterised as other international treaties or general principles of international law, referred to in article 61 of the African Charter, at least. The
question of whether the African Court’s interpretation is categorized under article 61 or
under the principle of systemic integration does not seem relevant, since both refer to
fairly similar sources of international law.
Hailbronner recommends an approach that according to the article 61 of the African
Charter, IHL could only be considered as ‘subsidiary measures’, implying a subsidiary
role of IHL, helping to fill gaps and give content to Charter provisions while assisting
with their application in practise.221 This approach would provide clarity and predictability to the deliberations of the human rights bodies. The possible disproportional effect
of this approach on international armed conflicts, in comparison with non-international
armed conflicts, would need to be further studied but is outside the scope of this thesis.
While Chapter 2.1 concludes that under IHL there is no individual right to claim reparations, it must also be noted that nothing in IHL precludes the right to reparation.222
Greenwood affirms that the monitoring mechanisms of human rights conventions could
be used in an indirect way to assist in ensuring compliance with IHL.223 As both the
Human Rights Committee and the African Commission and the Court, in their own
ways, take IHL into considerations in finding violations of their respective conventions,
an individual has the possibility to access a human rights body in cases where both bodies of law apply. The matter of how much foothold human rights bodies have already
taken in the matter in terms of reparations in an armed conflict settings and gendered
violence, will be looked at next.

REPARATIONS FOR GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN AFRICA

4.1

Reparations for violations of human rights law on the African
continent

4.1.1

Gender-based violence as discrimination

Due to the increased awareness of the gendered effects of armed conflicts and human
rights violations taking place during them, a gender approach to reparations has somewhat gained international attention. The ICC, in its first ever reparations case, highlighted the need of all victims to be considered, particularly the victims of sexual or gender
violence, among other vulnerable groups. This meant that reparation should be granted
and implemented without any discrimination, such as regards to age, ethnicity, political
belief or gender.224 The Human Rights Committee has also noted gender-based violence
but has mostly focused on it by statements in the reviewing of the country reports.225
The African Commission has passed a number of resolutions calling on member states
to guarantee the victims of sexual and gender-based violence the right to just and equitable reparation.226
The acknowledgement of gender-violence as a form of discrimination may assists in
detecting gender-based human rights violations. In the case of Egyptian Initiative for
Personal Rights and Interights v Egypt227 the African Commission expressly found that
the violations that have taken place were gender-based violence, a form of discrimination.228 More specifically, the African Commission found the Egyptian government responsible for discrimination against the victims in violation of articles 2 and 18(3). The
victims had alleged a series of human rights violations, such as sexual assault, commit-

224

See the Prosecutor v Thomas Lubanga.
See HRC Concluding Observations on the seventh periodic report of El Salvador, para 13 where the
Committee raised concerns ”at the high rates of domestic and sexual violence women, girls and adolescents. … The Committee is further concerned about the accessibility, particularly for women living in
rural areas, of the special courts set up to ensure that women can lead a life free from violence and discrimination.”

ted during a demonstration by the Egyptian authorities, amounting to discrimination and
furthermore a violation of their dignity and ill treatment in violation of Article 5. The
African Commission held that the incidents were targeted at the women participating or
present at the demonstration, and were perpetrated, even though the perpetrators themselves seemed to be aware of the effect of these type of violations in the context of the
Egyptian society, an Arab Muslim society where women’s virtue is measured by keeping herself physically and sexually unexposed except to her husband.229 Compensation
was awarded, according to the applicants requested amount, for the physical and emotional damage and trauma suffered. The Commission found that the acts were perpetrated by state actors or/and non-state actors under the control of state actors.230 In no point
did the Commission refer to any of its resolutions on gender-based violence and reparations, which i.e. provide guidance in ensuring that reparation afforded to victims of sexual violence is adequate and comprehensive, in particular in the light of “the extent of
physical and psychological trauma that women and girls face as a result of sexual violence.”231 I.e. the Resolution on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Women and
Girls Victims of Sexual Violence calls on State parties to the African Charter to ensure
accountability of perpetrators of sexual violence and to “put in place efficient and accessible reparation programmes that ensure information, rehabilitation and compensation for victims of sexual violence.”232. Had it done so, it could have with the support of
the instrument, awarded measures specifically tailored to address the gender aspects of
the violations for which it found the State responsible.233
More broadly related to discrimination, the African Commission has addressed discrimination and draw use of other sources of international law. In African Institute for Human Rights and Development (on behalf of Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea) v. Republic of Guinea a radio speech by the President of Guinea encouraged the armed forces
and citizens of Guinea to engage in mass discrimination against Sierra Leonean refugees
in Guinea, resulting in a number of human rights violations against refugees, including
the widespread rape of Sierra Leonean women in Guinea.234As provided by articles 60
and 61 of the Charter, the Commission yet again found it appropriate to look into the
principles and standards of international law, especially drawing use of international

refugee law.235 The Commission found, among other articles, a violation of article 2, 4
and 5 of the African Charter. It did not specify which actions fell under which article,
but it did take note of the complainants allegation that the speech gave rise to “widespread sexual violence against the Sierra Leonean women in Guinea with the Guinean
soldiers using rape as a weapon to discriminate against the refugees and to punish them
for being so-called rebels.” The African Commission also noted that “the complainants
contend that the violence described in the statements made under oath was undeniably
coercive, especially since the soldiers and the civilians used arms to intimidate and
threaten the women before and during the forced sexual relations.”236
The case approaches violence against women through discrimination, instead of leaning
on provisions on torture. This is most likely because of the group of victims was clearly
identified as refugees, ‘women’ not being the only common factor. Discriminatory practices have further been found, now with a specific reference to gender, in Institute for
Human Rights and Development in Africa (on behalf of Esmaila Connateh & 13 Others)
v Republic of Angola where the Commission ordered the country to “ensure that immigration policies, measures and legislations do not have the effect of discriminating
against persons on the basis of any prohibited ground (including race, colour, descent,
national, ethnic origin, or any other status), and particularly take into account the vulnerability of women, children and asylum seekers.”237 The resembling connection, this
time to asylum seekers, but also to women and children, can be identified.

4.1.2

Sexual violence as torture

Sexual violence, a form of gender-based violence, cannot necessarily always be identified as discrimination, and in its gravest forms, a different acknowledgement and classification is at place. Article 14 of the Convention against Torture (CAT) stipulates the
right of victims of torture to redress.238 As a customary norm of international law, the
prohibition of torture has been recognized already in the Lieber Code239 and further in
Article 3 Common to the Geneva Conventions where it prohibits “cruel treatment and

238
Convention against Torture (CAT), Article 14 states that Each State Party shall ensure in its legal
system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate
compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the
victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.’
239
Lieber Code, Article 16
236

42
torture” and “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading
treatment” of civilians and persons hors de combat.240 While no explicit reference to
gender-based or sexual violence is made, there is international consensus on the extreme
gravity of rape as a form of human rights violation. The characterization of rape as torture has been affirmed, in addition to the Committee against Torture,241 by other human
rights treaty bodies.242 As a non-derogable norm of international law, the prohibition of
torture and the characterization of rape as torture provides a strong foundation for a
right to reparations for situations where rape has for been used as a weapon of warfare.
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture in Africa issued in 2017 a General Comment No. 4 considering the right to redress for victims of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.243 The General Comment specifically refers to “those acts
of sexual and gender-based violence that amount to a form of torture and other illtreatment, (…) such as rape”244 and highlights both the applicability of human rights
norms during armed conflicts and the need for state parties to adopt specific measures to
ensure that victims of sexual and gender-based violence obtain redress. The paragraphs
on sexual and gender-based violence explicitly state that the “acts of sexual violence,
particularly rape, are also systematically used as a tool of war in armed conflict”.245 The
General Comment does not address all gender-based violations taking place during
armed conflicts but it does serve as recognition of the issue in its gravest forms.
Though the African Commission has not eagerly used references to its resolutions in its
decisions, a resolution more specific to the African context needs to be mentioned. The
African Commission has in 2002 adopted the Resolution on Guidelines and Measures
for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa’ (the Robben Island Guidelines), that provide among other duties the obligation to provide reparation to victims of torture and ill-treatment.246

240

Geneva Conventions, Common Article 3. Furthermore, “rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution,
forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity”
constitutes a crime against humanity under the Statute of the International Criminal Court. See The Rome
Statute Art. 7(1)(g), 8(2)(b)(xxii), and 8(2)(e)(vi).
241
See ie. case C.T. and K.M. v. Sweden which was the first case where the Committee against Torture
stated that rape can amount to torture under Article 1 of the convention. See also V.L. v. Switzerland
where the Committee provided more detailed legal analysis of the definition of torture and rape as constituting torture, and by referring to the shame and fear related to sexual violence, for the first time shows
sensitivity and attentiveness to gender issues.

43
The international recognition of rape as torture247 ties the resolution to gender-based
violence on the African continent, reinforcing the need to address and respond to the
needs of victims through reparations. According to the Robben Island Guidelines, an
obligation to provide reparation exists regardless of a successful criminal prosecution.248
Regarding findings on torture, the Human Rights Committee has only occasionally
clearly articulated the obligation of the state party to provide (medical) assistance,
though as Evans notes, it is widely agreed that victims of torture generally require not
only immediate medical attention, but also rehabilitation.249 This serves yet as another
example of the little attention to remedies the Human Rights Committee has given in its
jurisprudence. Evans notes that this may be due to the absence of consultations with the
victim on remedies as the complaint is under consideration.250 Though the normative
framework around torture, and rape as torture is undoubtedly strong, the Human Rights
Committee jurisprudence related to reparations for torture does not provide additional
strength to victims of gender-based violence.

4.1.3

Gender-specific human rights instruments and reparations

In addition to successfully being identified as forms of violations such as discrimination
and torture, gender-based violence has been identified through the creation of treaties
and treaty bodies focused on the elimination of gender-based violence. As a genderspecific treaty body, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has recommended, among other things, that states parties to the Convention “provide
and enforce appropriate, timely remedies for discrimination against women”. The recommendations further specify remedies as i.e. restitution, compensation and rehabilitation, 251 but also goes on to recommend the creation of women specific funds to guarantee the receipt of reparations in situations in which the violating party is unable or unwilling to provide such reparations.252 By naming remedies constituting reparations, the
recommendation draws a line from remedy to reparations. More specific to gender247

See, e.g., Delalić case, Judgment (§§ 1328 and 1731) (ICTY); Aydin v. Turkey (§§ 1344 and 1741)
(ECHR); Case 10.970 (Peru) (paras. 1349 and 1743) (IACtHR).

based violence in armed conflicts and post-conflict settings, the recommendation calls
for different forms of institutional reforms in accordance with international human
rights standards, and the rejection of amnesties for gender-based human rights violations.253 In connection with the institutional reform, the text acknowledges the Nairobi
Declaration Women’s and Girls Right to a Remedy and Reparation, a declaration highlighting the access for women and girls to reparations.254
The recommendation could be considered a document helping to connect human rights
instruments pronouncing on remedies, to actual reparations for violations taking place
in conflict settings. While Musila has noted that the term ‘remedy’, found in article 2(3)
of the African Charter, does not equal reparations but rather covers a range of measures
that include, but are not limited to, declarations, compensation and reparation,255 the
evidence points to the willingness of the African Commission to interpret the Charter as
a document allowing for the providing of reparations, even if the reparations recommended have sometimes been read into a ‘right to remedy’, rather than ‘a right to reparations’ per se.256 The African Commission has not, however, often referred to resolutions or other reinforcing documents but rather seemed to come to conclusions without
shedding light on all the factors considered in the analysis of cases, making the evaluation of the weight of resolutions and declarations difficult. On the other hand, the lack
of references to additional instruments may acts as proof that the African Commission
does not consider the question as a controversial one.
The African Court has in one case, APDF & IHRDA v Republic of Mali257 found a violation of the Maputo Protocol, relating to harmful traditional practices, ordering Mali to
amend its national law to ensure it abides by its obligation under the Maputo Protocol,
among other sources of international law. Budoo argues that it would be safe to assume
the African Court would not hesitate to give another verdict against a country violating
the Maputo Protocol, if all the preliminary conditions were met. Budoo however states
that in most cases the admissibility requirements have been difficult to satisfy. A member state needs to make a declaration under article 34(6) of the African Court Protocol258
for NGOs to be able to access the Court.259 The fact that for an NGO to bring a case

against a state requires this action from the states themselves, possibly charged with

actualization of the rights of the individual.
Gender-based violence in an armed conflict was considered directly in the DRC case,
where approximately 2,000 HIV-positive Rwandan and Ugandan soldiers raped Congolese women and young girls in order to spread AIDS to the Congolese population.260
The DRC brought the complaint asserting, among other things, that the mass rape and
deliberate infection of women and girls with HIV constituted a violation of human
rights under the African Charter. By referring to both articles 60 and 61 of the Charter,
the African Commission held that the Geneva Conventions and the two Additional Protocols are to be taken into consideration as subsidiary measures to determine the principles of international law.261 The African Commission noted that the alleged acts of violence against women are prohibited under article 76 of the First Protocol Additional to
the Geneva Conventions (Protection of Women), as well as are offensive to both the
African Charter and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women.262 How these breaches were found, the Commission does not elaborate
on. Among other articles, the African Commission found violations of articles 18(1) and
(3), apparently since it also found violations of the CEDAW. In addition to ordering an
immediate withdrawal of the offending states’ armed forces, the Commission requested
adequate reparations to be paid to the DRC for the victims of human rights violations
committed.263 The complaint was brought to the African Commission by the DRC on
behalf of its citizens. Whether this factor had an impact on the large amount of IHL referred to in the communication is not evident. The Maputo Protocol, specifically requiring states to establish services for i.e. reparation for victims of violence against women
was adopted after the case, in July 2003.
There is currently no case law on the application of article 11 of the Maputo Protocol
and reparations in the African Court. However, the fact that the Maputo Protocol directly addresses reparations and violence against women in armed conflicts could be considered a development towards a more consistent realisation of reparations for an individual. Viljoen suggest that the formulation of article 11(3) of the Maputo Protocol incorporates the corpus of IHL – both treaty-based and customary law, at least as far as it
relates to women – into the Protocol, and therefore brings those provisions under the

jurisdiction of the African Commission and the Court.264 Viljoen suggests, based on his
assumption that the African Commission has also not yet developed a firm stance on the
role of international humanitarian law in its jurisprudence265, that it developed a more
consistent approach, in line with the DRC findings, also highlighting its mandate that is
not restricted to the African Charter alone. It could rely on IHL in an increasing manner
even as the source of violations in respects of treaties it has jurisdiction over, such as the
Maputo Protocol, already applied by the African Court.266 Considering the DRC case
that involved state parties rather than an individual on one side, it remains difficult to
assess whether similar line of rulings would affect the standing of an individual in terms
of reparations.
As the flow of cases in front of the African Court is most likely not going to significantly rise and therefore not remarkably affect the access to justice for individuals in practice, the emphasis on the handling of cases related to gender-based violations taking
places on armed conflicts will remain on other human rights bodies. The reference to
the Maputo Protocol by the African Court is however, a valuable one, and since the African Commission has, similarly to the references to IHL, referred to CEDAW, and is
likely to follow to adjudicate the Protocol as its jurisdiction also covers it.

4.1.4

The responsibility of states for non-state actors to provide reparations

As human rights typically protect the individual against the abuse of state powers, modern warfare poses a challenge regarding the state’s ability to protect its citizens. The
relevance of the question of the responsibility of states for the actions of non-state actors is evident in armed conflicts of a non-international character and conflicts with
multiple parties to the conflict. Relevant also to the definition of torture, the CAT definition refers to a public official or a person acting in an official capacity,267 not addressing private parties or the states’ responsibility regarding them. However, the Human
Rights Committee’s General comment 31 describes state responsibility to provide reparation for acts of torture or ill-treatment committed by private actors in cases where
states have not succeeded in taking appropriate measures or in exercising “due diligence
264

Viljoen (2014) p. 322.
See Darfur case from 2009 where the African Commission once again seemed to chance its direction,
falling back on its initial position of avoiding any reference to IHL standards. According to Viljoen this
not only contrasts with its approach in the DRC case, but also with its report of its 2004 fact-finding mission to Darfur. Differences between Darfur case and the DRC case demand an explanation. See Viljoen

to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-state officials or private actors.”268 The Inter-American Court has also addressed the issue of due diligence and the
requirements of it in its jurisprudence, which will be discussed in the next sub-chapter
in comparison with the African Commission’s jurisprudence.
One of the first African Commission cases dealing with gender-based violence, Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v. Zimbabwe, was the one to establish that a state can
be held accountable for the violations committed by private actors. The complainant
argued that even if the alleged perpetrators were not agents of the government, the government would still be held liable for a violation of the African Charter, since the government has an obligation under article 1 of the Charter to ensure that people within its
jurisdiction are treated in accordance with international norms and standards,269 likely
assuming the African Commission would go on to determine whether the state had fulfilled its due diligence obligation or not and could be held responsible for violations
conducted by private actors.
The African Commission did refer to the well-known Velásquez Rodriguez case of the
Inter-American Court of Human rights, where the Inter-American Court affirmed that
states must prevent, investigate and punish any violation recognized by the Convention.270 It was stated that if the state did not address mass rape with due diligence, the
state itself could be held accountable. More specifically, the African Commission held
that that a “State can be held complicit where it fails systematically to provide protection of violations from private actors who deprive any person of his/her human rights.”
The African Commission did, however, note that “unlike for direct State action, the
standard for establishing State responsibility in violations committed by private actors is
more relative”, and it is demonstrated by establishing that the state confines a pattern of
abuse through pervasive non-action. To avoid complicity, “States must demonstrate due
diligence by taking active measures to protect, prosecute and punish private actors who
commit abuses.”271 Similar approach was encouraged by the African Commission’s Fair
Trial and Legal Assistance Guidelines that recommend the state to investigate and punish all complaints of violence against women, whether the alleged acts are perpetrated
by the state, its officials or agents or by private persons, and that ensure a nondiscriminatory approach towards victims.272

The case offers some clarity on the boundaries of the responsibility of the state opposed
to non-state actors in the African regional system. The African Commission found that
the state had exercised due diligence in its response to the violence: “it had investigated
the allegations, amended some of its laws and in some cases, paid compensation to victims.” According to the African Commission, ”it suffices for the state to demonstrate
that the measures taken were proportionate to deal with the situation” and the fact that
“all the allegations could not be investigated does not make the state liable for violations committed by non-state actors.”273 The African Commission has also in the case of
Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Interights v Egypt274 highlighted the control
exercised over the non-state perpetrators by the state of Egypt as a factor establishing
responsibility.275
It has been suggested that the African Commission is starting to develop a more solid
line of reasoning regarding the obligation of states for the illegal acts of non-state actors,276 since it has addressed the issue in other cases, i.e. the complaint focused on the
behaviours of an oil consortium between the state oil company and Shell in Nigeria. 277
Whether this development will address actors such as armed groups or private military
companies is not evident but could naturally follow as complaints in front of the African
Commission emerge.

Reparations for violence against women in the Inter-American Human
rights system

Celorio has researched the Inter-American human rights instruments and their application by the Inter-American Court and the Commission of human rights and has identified a time period (”The First line of Merits Rulings by the Inter-American Commis273

sion”), 1994-2001, during which the commission, according to the author, began to set
standards in several areas, including ”the obligation of States, including their respective
judicial branches, to act with the due diligence necessary and without delay to prevent,
investigate, sanction, and offer reparations for acts of violence against women, even
when the acts are perpetrated by non-State actors.”278 As the conditions for reparations
to be granted, the author also notes that standards regarding ”the obligation to guarantee
a de jure and de facto access to adequate and effective judicial remedies when acts of
violence against women occur” was set.” The legal characterization of rape as torture
when perpetrated by public officials is also brought up.279
A second line of ruling in 2007-2009, giving more content to the standards, strengthened the Court’s ability to rule on women’s rights.280 According to the author, the main
contributions of three specific judgements related to gender-based violence include
among others the jurisprudence on reparations.281 An analysis on the scope of the state
obligation provides a useful parallel that the norms applicable and their manifestation in
the case law of the African Commission and the Court will be compared with. The obligation of states to investigate, sanction and offer reparations for gender-based violations
of human rights, an element derived from Celorio’s study, will be discussed regarding
the jurisprudence related to gender-based violence on the African continent. More recent case law from the Inter-American Court will also be taken into consideration regarding the obligations concerning the acts of non-state actors.282 Whether and in which
way these obligations may be influenced by IHL, during an armed conflict, will be discussed.
Though Cotton Field does not refer to IHL, the Inter-American Court has had several
cases that have allowed it to consider IHL as a source of interpretation of the InterAmerican Convention, such as situations of internal armed conflicts, where both IHL
278

Celorio (2011) p. 824. Furthermore, the Commission has indicated that the due diligence duty to investigate, prevent and sanction violence against women includes acts perpetrated by private actors, including
the contexts of domestic violence. See Jessica Lenahan (Gonzalez) et al. v. United States, paras 120 and
133. Another more recent judgement regarding the rights of women, IV v. Bolivia, paras. 152–57, 175, a
decision on forced sterilization, highlighted the relationship between maternal health and the rights to
privacy and to personal integrity. In respect of the previous, free, and informed consent of women to
medical interventions is essential. Both rulings build on the IACtHR’s prior gender jurisprudence and set
important new precedents by providing detailed content to the duties of due diligence and by explaining
the circumstances in which States can be held liable for breaching them.

and human rights law apply.283 It has also emphasized the protective aspect of IHL, deriving from Article 3 Common to the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocol
II thereto, providing the individual with not only passive protection, but also requiring
the state to impede violations against third parties.284
While on one hand the case law of the Inter-American Court and the Commission discussed here only have authority related to the specific rights they concern, it can also
guide states on how to effectively implement the rights contained in their respective
instruments at the national level.285 The guidance-providing dimension of the case law
serves as an interpretative aid for the purposes of this thesis. In order to establish the
length the two systems functioning in realms of traditional justice mechanisms have
gone to pronounce on reparations for gender-based violence, a comparison is helpful.

4.2.2

The obligations of a state or a non-state actor to prevent and investigate as
foundation for reparations

Celorio highlights the role of certain cases in enhancing the nature of the state obligations related to due diligence and access to justice when the victims are at the risk of
facing violations of human rights on the basis of factors such as their age, race, ethnicity, gender and multiple others.286 In Cotton Field, the Inter-American Court, by confirming its competency to review claims under the Inter-American Convention on the
Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women (the Convention
of Belém do Pará)287, opened a door for future petitions alleging human rights violations
with gender-specific causes, in the realm of violence against women. Building on Cotton Field, the Inter-American Court has in its later case law reiterated what it had al-

Carrying out said obligations is significant in the instant case, insofar as the massacre was committed in a
situation in which civilians were unprotected in a non-international domestic armed conflict.”

ready found constituting ’violence against women’.288 The obligations identified in Cotton Field have been identified in multiple cases such as Raquel Martin de Mejía v. Peru,289 Morales de Dierra v. Guatemala290, González Pérez v. Mexico291 and Da Penha
Maia Fernandes v. Brazil292.
The factors identified in the creation of a state obligation related to due diligence and
access to justice, highlighted in Cotton Field were the recognition of the gravity of the
problem of violence against women and the ”culture of discrimination” influencing the
society, reports by international actors indicating the actions were manifestations of
gender-based violence, the disadvantaged position of the victims and the evidence
demonstrating that the victims had suffered forms of ill-treatment and probably sexual
abuse before they had been murdered.293 The Inter-American Court recognized that the
State had the obligation to adopt all the positive measures necessary to guarantee the
rights of girls, within a context of known disappearances, because they formed a group
at particular risk to human rights violations.294 Celorio considered the judgement to
highlight link between discrimination and violence against women, following the
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against women.295
Cotton Field provides clarity of the scope and the content of the state obligation in cases
of violence against women particularly in the realms of prevention, investigation, and
reparations from the perspective of gender-based violence and discrimination.296 When
it comes to prevention, the Inter-American Court found that the obligation includes the
adoption of legal, public policy and institutional measures for the protection of women
from risk factors and the prevention of acts of violence.297 Celorio notes that the Inter288

Celorio (2011) p. 843. In Cotton Field paras. 228–231 the Court says it “considered as factors: (1) that
the State had recognized before the Court both the gravity of the problem of violence against women and
the influence of a "culture of discrimination" in Ciudad Judrez; (2) reports from international bodies and
non- governmental organizations indicating that many of these murders were manifestations of genderbased violence; (3) that in this case the victims were young, socioeconomically disadvantaged women,
who were workers or students, as many of the victims were in this context; and (4) that the evidentiary
record demonstrated that the victims had all suffered forms of ill-treatment and probably sexual abuse
before they were murdered.”

American Court specifically refers to ‘strict due diligence’, even though it does take
into account its precedent about the limited responsibility of the state for human rights
violations committed by private individuals and the requirement of knowledge of a situation of real and immediate danger in order to incur liability. The strict due diligence
obligation arises in a known context of serious acts of violence against women.298
Similar obligations can be found in the realm of IHL. Where Cotton Field elaborates on
the obligation to prevent, IHL, in order to prevent serious violations of its protective
provisions during a conflict, contains a foundational obligation to implement. According to the Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the state has an obligation to ensure national implementation of IHL, which will contribute to preventing
serious violations of its provisions during a conflict, making the transition process after
the hostilities have ended much more viable.299 Article 76 of the Additional Protocol I
to the Geneva Conventions elaborates even further and considers women as ”the object
of special respect” stating that they ”shall be protected in particular against rape, forced
prostitution and any other form of indecent assault.”300 The implementation of this special obligation of ”special respect” serves as prevention of the listed violations. The explicit mention of women to be considered with ”special respect” could be considered a
due diligence of some type in the realm of IHL.
The Inter-American Court states that the obligation to investigate human rights violations in the general context of violence against women is, in addition to be performed in
a prompt, serious, impartial and an exhaustive manner, has a “wider scope”.301 It also
highlights the negative and positive obligations of the State in cases of violence against
women, including the obligation to remove all factual and juridical obstacles to the due
investigation of the facts and the conduct of the proceedings and also to ensure that investigations have a gender perspective.302
Despite the importance of investigations, there is a lack of detail about the standards,
principles and international law on investigations relevant to investigations in armed
conflicts. In addition to provisions on providing for effective penal sanctions for persons
suspected of having committed or ordering the commission of ”graves breaches” and
”other serious violations of the laws and customs of war” (synonymous with ”war

crimes”),303 Salm argues there is a duty under customary international law to prosecute
those who have committed violations of the laws and customs of war in a noninternational armed conflict.304 Though amnesties sometimes come up in the aftermath
of a conflict, violations of international law are generally not what amnesties are aimed
at. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, on the subject of torture, has stated
that: “Amnesties are generally incompatible with the duty of States to investigate such
acts; to guarantee freedom from such acts within their jurisdiction; and to ensure that
they do not occur in the future.”305 For its part, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has asserted that it is necessary to “…ensure compatibility of recourse to the
granting of amnesties or pardons for persons who have risen up in arms against the State
with the State’s obligation to clarify, punish, and make reparation for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law…”306 The obligation to investigate is
essentially linked to the obligation to make reparation.
The Inter-American Court has also contributed to reparations per se, namely by stating
which reparations should be awarded from a gender perspective. Though the content of
reparations falls outside the scope of the thesis, it should be mentioned that the InterAmerican Court, setting a standard for the actualization of reparations, further elaborates the obligation of states to guarantee adequate access to justice to victims and their
family members, in order to obtain remedies in cases of discrimination and violence
against women.307 It seems that the Inter-American Court will not address reparations
separately from the due diligence obligations to prevent and investigate violations and it
has stated that obstacles in the pursuit of justice may amount to serious violations of
human rights.308

4.2.3

The elements of gender-based violence in Cotton Field in comparison with
the jurisprudence of the African Commission and the Court

The African Commission has taken a similar approach to the Inter-American Court and
the CEDAW Committee and identified the link between discrimination and gender303

Articles 49, 50, 129 and 146 respectively of the four Geneva Conventions contain obligations related
to suppressing all the violations of IHL, to search for and prosecute those responsible for the violations.

based violence. In EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt the violations that took place were
specifically identified as gender-based violence, a form of discrimination.309 Similarly
to Cotton Field, the high-risk culture of the Egyptian society was referred to in the African Commissions reasoning. The African Commission took note of the fact that the
perpetrators seemed to be aware of the context of the Egyptian society where the consequences of their actions would yield especially severe consequences for women.310 In
Cotton Field, the corresponding observation was further strengthened by several reports
of international organisations indicating that the violations in question were manifestations of gender-based violence.311 The African Commission continues to state that the
perpetrators were aware of the consequences of such acts on the victims and their families.312 Both the Inter-American Court and the African Commission refer to a similar
factor; the Inter-American Court further leaning on the international acknowledgement
of the state of the society.
A third element that the Inter-American Court highlighted in Cotton Field was that it
was proved that the victims suffered of physical ill treatment and very probably sexual
abuse.313 In EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt the African Commission also acknowledged the physical injuries and emotional trauma established by medical reports.314 The
African Commission additionally noted that the physical assaults described were gender-specific as the acts occurred could only be directed to women, and highlights that
the victims were targeted in this manner because of their gender.315 As another element,
the African Commission notes that the threats and accusations of the victims for practicing prostitution, when they refused to withdraw their complaints can also be characterized as gender-specific.316 As a fourth element in Cotton Field the Inter-American Court
highlighted the disadvantageous position of the victims; they were young, socioeconomically disadvantaged women who were workers or students.317 In EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt all the victims were female journalists who had different reasons

for being present at the time the assaults took place; the first victim was only passing
by, the second was covering the events in her capacity as a journalist.318
Similar recognition of the vulnerable or disadvantageous position of the group of victims (in addition to the fact that they were women living in a society characterized by “a
culture of discrimination”) was not made in EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt, apparently since the victims had a different common denominator; they were all journalists,
though not all present in their official capacities. The African Commission has, however, identified groups by referring to refugees in African Institute for Human Rights and
Development (on behalf of Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea) v. Republic of Guinea.
The African Commission referred to international refugee law by reference to articles
60 and 61 of the African Charter and stated that in that particular case rape had been
used as a weapon to discriminate against refugees.319
The African Commission is yet to follow the example of the Inter-American Court regarding the Inter-American Convention and the Convention of Belém do Pará, and
elaborate on the link of obligations enshrined in the Charter and in the Maputo Protocol.
As noted earlier, the Maputo Protocol can be seen to incorporate IHL, and has already
been applied by the African Court. The African Commission could also strengthen its
argumentation in future cases by aiming to identify particular factors of vulnerability,
which often characterizes especially victims of armed conflict, in order to create consistency and strength. In EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt, identifying the women’s
occupation as a common denominator could have perhaps lead to suspecting violations
of another kind, for example freedom of expression. The issue with the African Commission’s statement lies in the fact that gender-based violence does not only appear
through acts that can be ’only directed to women’. Though this was not the only reason
behind identifying gender-based violence, it cannot be considered an element creating a
solid reasoning to build on.
The existence of an armed conflict is unlikely to alter the definition of gender-based
violence. The consideration of women as the object of ‘special respect’ would in itself
suggest IHL assumes the vulnerable position of women in armed conflicts straightforwardly. When considering IHL as an interpretive aid in applying the quite broadly formulated Charter rights, the African Commission could possibly strengthen its definition
of gender-based violence by drawing inspiration from IHL that seems to highlight the

specific needs for protection afforded to women, at least in international armed conflicts.320

4.2.4

The scope of state obligations to prevent, investigate and offer reparations in
Cotton Field in comparison with the jurisprudence of the African Commission and the Court

On the state obligation to prevent violations of human rights, the Inter-American Court
in Cotton Field highlighted the obligation to adopt legal, public policy and institutional
measures to protect women from risk factors and prevent violence and referred to “strict
due diligence” with respect to a report of missing women and the efforts to locate them
during the first hours and days, since there was a real and imminent risk of them being
ill-treated and killed.321 In a more narrow way, the African Commission previously in
SERAC case affirmed the governments’ “duty to protect their citizens, … through appropriate legislation and affective enforcement.”322 The approaches are fairly alike,
however, the African Commission does not refer to due diligence in any stricter manner
when it comes to gender-based violations. It does, however, emphasize that the said
obligation involves the protection of citizens from damaging acts that may be perpetrated by private parties.323 In EIPH INTERIGHTS v Egypt, the African Commission made
an observation that it was evident that the victim’s had not been protected from the perpetrators and other actors during the events that took place, referring to an obligation to
protect.324 The African Commission has further leaned on the Inter-American Court’s
pronouncements, the ‘due diligence principle’, on a state’s responsibility also for violations not directly imputable to the state.325 The reference to a ‘more relative’ standard
i.e. the need to establish that the state confines a patterns of pervasive non-action was
brought up in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v. Zimbabwe, with a requirement
to take measures to offer protection and to prosecute and punish private actors who
commit abuses.326

responsibility of the state.
326
Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v. Zimbabwe, para. 160.
321

57
The African Commission also found that state responsibility can be generated by the
lack of due diligence in preventing the violation or for not taking necessary steps in
providing victims with reparation.327 Reparations seem to be interlinked with the duty to
prevent and offer protection also in the jurisprudence on the African Commission. The
influence of IHL provisions on the due diligence obligation needs to be discussed to
understand the effect of an armed conflict. Though the African Commission will not
pronounce on violations other than the instruments it is mandated to apply, mainly the
Charter, it has found Charter violations by reference to IHL and by virtue of articles 60
and 61 of the Charter. In the DRC case, the African Commission found a violation of
the Charter by considering Article 76 of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. 328 By taking this article referring to “special respect of women” into consideration, stricter due diligence obligations regarding violations against women during
armed conflict would possibly become applied.
Building on the principles of international law, the Inter-American Court stated it based
its decisions in the matter on article 63(1) of the American Convention, the article on
remedy and compensation.329 Though the Inter-American Court has in cases such Cotton Field simply referred back to the principle that any violation of an international obligation resulting in harm entails the obligation to make adequate reparation, it has also
connected the investigatory obligations to reparations. In Cotton Field it referred to the
Inter-American Commission, who has indicated that “a full reparation requires that the
state investigate the disappearances and subsequent murders (of the victims) with due
diligence and impartiality, and exhaustively, in order to clarify the historic truth of the
facts. To this end, the State must adopt all necessary judicial and administrative
measures to complete the investigation, find, prosecute and punish the perpetrator or
perpetrators and mastermind or masterminds and provide full information on the results.”330 Though there is a clear obligation in international law, followed by the InterAmerican Court’s jurisprudence on the obligation to make adequate reparation, the Inter-American Court finds that investigation and reparations are critically linked – there
cannot be “full reparation” without an impartial and exhaustive investigation conducted
with due diligence. The African Commission, in Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum

Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.

v. Zimbabwe, similarly refers to Velásquez Rodríguez where providing victims with
adequate compensation was essentially linked to other elements of state responsibility;
investigation, prevention, identifying the responsible and punishing them appropriately.331 The African Commission similarly regards reparations, in the case at hand ’compensation’, as an integral part of the due diligence process. Since, as earlier noted, state
responsibility can be triggered by neglecting to take the steps to provide victims with
reparations, the term compensation could be read to point to the full measure of different forms of reparation.
Cotton Field was the first case to establish that the obligation to investigate has a ‘wider
scope’ when the case in question deals with a woman who had been killed, ill-treated
and whose “personal liberty was affected within the framework of a general context of
violence against women.”332 Referring to the approach taken by the European Court of
Human Rights on racially motivated violence, the Inter-American Court held that the
wider scope is necessary in order to reassert society’s condemnation of gender-based
violence and to build and maintain the confidence of the group of people protected in
the capabilities of the authorities to indeed offer them protection from the threat of gender-based violence.333 The Inter-American Court highlighted the negative and positive
obligations of the state in cases of violence against women, including the obligation to
remove all factual and juridical obstacles to the proper investigation of the facts and
also to ensure a gender perspective in the course of the investigation. By gender perspective it meant an investigation that had a specific line of inquiry related to sexual
violence, and among other things, was conducted by officials trained in addressing discrimination and gender-based violence.334 In EIPR and INTERIGHTS v. Egypt it was
according to the African Commission evident, without an in-depth elaboration of the
scope of the obligation, that the state had not fulfilled its obligation, since it had failed
to conduct an effective investigation and hold anyone accountable.335 The state’s obligation to investigate does not stand out in the case law of the African Commission as a
separate element so much as it is mentioned in connection with the obligation to prevent
violations, in reference to the requirement of due diligence. IHL does not similarly connect the obligation to investigate to reparations. However, since the efforts to identify a

who has stated simliarly on the discriminatory element of a violation that where an ”attack is racially
motivated, it is particularly important that the investigation is pursued with vigor and impartiality… ”.
The Inter-American Court held that ” this criterion is wholly applicable when examining the scope of the
obligation of due diligence in the investigation of cases of gender-based violence.”

pure, individual right to reparation have not been successful in practise, allowing the
mutual reinforcement of IHL and human rights law to enter the sphere of investigations
could possibly have an effect on the content of the obligation to investigate, and, possibly highlight the reparatory dimension.
The Inter-American Court, in determining the scope of investigation has clearly taken
an approach with a goal to educate the society and reaffirm the values enshrined in the
conventions, for example steer the society from the “culture of discrimination” towards
a more egalitarian environment. Considering the nature of the African Commission’s
decisions and recommendations as authoritative interpretations, yet not judgements per
se, it may have a more difficult job if pursuing to follow this line of action. However, in
its approach to due diligence, similar desire could be identified. Due diligence is discussed by the African Commission in many cases with the threat of attributing the responsibility for the acts of private and non-state actors directly or indirectly the state, if
no effective investigation is being conducted. This might be evidence of a political motive in the work of the African Commission; an encouragement or a threat towards the
states to actually start taking more extensive measures in guaranteeing the rights of their
citizens. Essentially, the African Commission and the Inter-American Court are referring to a very similar element in the obligation to investigate: the need to push for
change and, as the Inter-American Court further elaborated, to build and maintain the
confidence of the group of people protected in the capabilities of the authorities to offer
them protection. In a more recent case, the Inter-American Court directly notes that the
states “must adopt the required measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of
conduct of men and women and to eliminate prejudices, customary practices and other
practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and on
stereotyped roles for men and women.”336 The Inter-American Court carries this task
out with a specific tool – the requirement for a “wider scope” in the investigation of
gender-based violence in high-risk contexts. Whether the African Commission follows
this line of rulings is to be discovered.
The African Commission has for the time being addressed reparations specifically in
gender-based violence related cases in a rather undefined manner. In the DRC case it
recommended “adequate reparations be paid, according to the appropriate ways to the

336

60
Complainant State for and on behalf of the victims of the human rights” 337, without any
specification or further requirements. Even more distantly, the African Commission has
recommended that a commission to be established, to assess the losses of victim with a
view to compensate them.338 Reparations, when mentioned by the African Commission,
have been most regularly brought up in connection with cases concerning the legality or
rather, unconstitutionality of amnesties, leading to situations where in theory, domestic
remedies may have been available for victims, but “as a matter of practicality were not
capable of yielding any prospect of success to the victims of the criminal assaults.”339

CONCLUSION

Both criticism and praise have been raised about the blurring distinction between the
two bodies of law; international humanitarian law and human rights law. Critics point to
the fact that the increasing application of IHL by the regional human rights bodies
might lead to IHL becoming fragmented in its application.340 On the other hand, the
convergence, and more specifically, the influence of human rights law on other branches of international law has been recognized having potential to strengthen the position
of a victim of violations of international law.
Though human rights law has undoubtedly affected the interpretation of international
humanitarian law, a right to present reparation claims based in IHL towards a violating
party of in armed conflict, is not sustainable. Human rights mechanism, however, provide an individual an access to a body receiving individual claims, since it has been
thoroughly established that international human rights law does not cease to apply, even
during armed conflicts. Though no explicit reparation clauses exist in human rights instruments applicable in Africa, both the African Commission and the Human Rights
Committee have seen their respective instruments as ones granting and individual the
right to reparation for violations of the conventions. The African regional system has
awarded individuals with different forms of remedies, whereas the Human Rights
Committee has in its Concluding observations highlighted the States’ responsibility in
implementing the right to compensation and reparation. While the Human Rights
Committee is clear on its position regarding the right to reparation and it has in its Concluding observations suggested multiple remedies to improve the position of an individual, its stance has had little value to an individual claiming to be a victim. On the other
hand, the lack of a reparation clause in both the ICCPR and the African Charter may
have contributed to the formation of regional, quasi-judicial bodies with reparations
mandates.
Given the lack of mandate among IHL mechanisms to deal with non-international
armed conflicts, mechanisms and bodies of other branches of international law such as
the UN Commission on Human Rights, later the Human Rights Council, and the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights have taken initiative in this regard. The absence of a formal mandate for international humanitarian law however restricts their
practice. The African Commission has been suggested to have approached IHL as only
a ‘subsidiary measure’, helping to fill gaps and give content to Charter provisions while

340

CRC (2003) pp. 59–60.

62
assisting with their application in practise. However, the African Commission’s ability
to adjudicate the Maputo Protocol brings the corpus of IHL to the sphere of application
of the Commission and the Court. It could rely on IHL in an increasing manner even as
the source of violations.
Human rights mechanisms lack the competence to deal directly with violations by
armed groups, although they attempt to address them in reports or General Recommendations, or by finding States responsible for omission or acquiescence in the face of
violations by armed groups. As the Human Rights Committee has highlighted the state’s
responsibility to prevent, protect and punish violations of human rights conducted by
private, non-state actors, the African Commission has highlighted the states’ responsibility for acts committed by armed groups. Though important developments for the individual, they does not address the issue in its entirety: if and when the state cannot be
held responsible for the violations committed by armed groups, how can the individual
access reparations, since the human rights mechanisms only regulate the relationship
between the individual and the state?
The Inter-American Court has taken significant steps in creating sustainable standards
for state responsibility for violations of human rights, specifically on terms of genderbased violence. Similar obligations to prevent, investigate and provide reparations for
violations of human rights can be identified in the jurisprudence of the African Commission, but to a lesser extent. The obligation to investigate is essentially interlinked
with the obligation to provide reparations, through which the obligation to repair can
been seen as strengthened on the African continent. In the context of an armed conflict,
instruments such as the Maputo Protocol highlight the application of human rights, specifically women’s rights, and are moulding the bigger picture towards a more seamless
interplay between the two regimes. Though consistency has not been reached in terms
of creating a solid jurisprudence, there are likely to come plenty of opportunities to
make it happen.
Though the case law of both the African Commission and the Court and the Human
Rights Committee have confirmed the existence of the right to reparation and have utilized their respective treaty provisions in order to award individuals with reparations, a
solid and accomplished jurisprudence on the actualisation of the right to reparation in
armed conflicts cannot yet be detected. The given acknowledgements about the existence of a right to reparation have, however, very likely contributed to the number of
initiatives and resolutions on the topic specifically. When the concept of a ‘right to reparation’ for gender-based violations in armed conflicts is still to be consistently executed,
another question regarding the practicalities of reparations needs to be asked. If the tra-

63
ditional forms of justice are being utilized and effective reparations awarded through
them, is a strengthened ‘right to reparation’ even necessary on the continent? In the aftermath of a conflict, the vast number of claims puts unusual pressure on the legal systems and in those situations traditional forms of justice may prove more efficient and
prompter in responding to victim’s needs. Additional questions arise, relating to the
needs of the victim: Is ‘official recognition’ needed, and what constitutes ‘official’ for
the victims? In order to find out the actual effectiveness and gain from the reparation
regime applicable in Africa from a victim-perspective, a study on the ground, comparing the non-judicial, traditional mechanisms and their effectiveness to the judicial ones
would need to be conducted.
