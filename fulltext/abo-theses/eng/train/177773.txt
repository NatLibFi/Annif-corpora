Supervisor: Edvard Johansson
Abstract:
Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the USA, has been an avid user of the social
media platform Twitter before and during his presidency. He has frequently used this
platform to communicate with the public. Trump tweets almost every, sometimes even
multiple times per day. Since he became elected as president of the USA he has tweeted
about a company on multiple occasions. What happens to the stock of these companies
when arguably the most powerful man on the planet voices his opinion to the millions
of people that read his tweets? That is the question that seeks to be answered within this
thesis.
The purpose of this thesis is to examine if and how the stocks of publicly listed
companies are affected when President Donald Trump tweets about the companies. To
attempt to ascertain whether such an effect exists and if so, how large it is, the effects
of company-specific tweets on abnormal return, abnormal trading volume and volatility
are analysed. To determine this, all tweets from Trump’s official Twitter accounts,
@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS, from November 9, 2016 to January 31, 2020 that
mention a company publicly traded on the U.S. stock market have been analysed. The
results were achieved by using OLS regressions with fixed effects on a company level,
while also controlling for company size and the first three lags of abnormal return,
abnormal trading volume, and volatility, respectively.
The results in this thesis indicate that when Trump tweets the stock market reacts. More
specifically, when Trump posts a tweet with a positive connotation towards a company,
1

Christian Hoven
the abnormal return of that company increases, while tweets with a negative connotation
decrease abnormal return. This effect is greater for tweets that were posted during the
opening hours of the U.S. stock exchange, and smaller for tweets posted before
President Trump’s inauguration. Companies operating within the automobile industry
experience a larger impact than other companies on their abnormal return when
President Trump tweets about them. The opposite is the case for companies operating
in the defense industry.
President Trump’s tweets also impact abnormal trading volume of the stocks of the
companies he mentions in his tweets. In this case there is no distinction between positive
and negative tweets. All of President Trump’s company-specific tweets increase
abnormal trading volume. Tweets posted when the U.S. stock exchange was open have
a larger impact on trading volume than those posted when the U.S. stock market is
closed. President Trump’s tweets that were posted before his inauguration had a smaller
effect on volatility than those posted after.
When President Trump tweets, the U.S. stock market becomes more volatile. Tweets
from President Trump increase the volatility of the stocks of the companies mentioned
in those tweets. Again, the effect is greater when the tweets are posted during the
opening hours of the U.S. stock exchange, and smaller when the tweet was posted before
Trump was sworn in as president.

1. Introduction
Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is known to frequently
communicate to the public via the social media platform Twitter, often multiple times
per day. His tweets have caused some controversy and are often vary unpredictable.
As the president of the USA, Donald Trump is one of the most powerful people
according to Forbes (2018) and one of the most influential people in the world
according to Time Magazine (2019). Therefore, he has the power to influence the
decisions of many people. That means that his opinions, which are reflected in his
tweets, may have the power to affect investment decisions of many investors. His
tweets may also include information on future decisions he will make as president of
the USA, concerning things such as trade tariffs, government contracts and bailouts.
These decisions may affect the future of a company. That is why it is interesting to
find out if the tweets he posts that mention companies are affecting the stock market.
Figure 1 below shows what happened to the price and trading volume of Toyotas stock
around the time Trump posted a Tweet about Toyota. This shows that right after the
tweet was posted the price fell and the trading volume increased. This singular case
does not in itself indicate that Trump´s tweets influence stocks, but it shows that the
tweet in this case might have done so. This pattern warrants analysing more tweets to
find out if they have a statistically significant effect on company stocks. Other tweets
may also affect stocks as investors may find new information relevant to the future of
the company in the statements in the tweets.

The figure shows the price and trading volume of Toyota ADR in a 60-minute window around January
5, 2017 when Trump tweeted “Toyota Motor said will build new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla
cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.” Source: Ge, Kurov & Wolfe (2018)

The question I aim to answer is interesting for a couple of reasons. Firstly, President
Trump tweets very often. It is therefore of importance to know how these tweets affect
the stocks of companies mentioned in said tweets. This will give President Trump and
other influential people knowledge on what kind of an effect their tweets that mention
companies have on stocks. With the help of this information influential people will
know how their tweets affect stocks and can therefore adjust their tweeting behaviour
to mitigate possible losses for companies. Knowing how the market reacts to President
Trump´s tweets may also be important for investors if they want to capitalise on the
change in stock price these tweets may cause. Secondly, there has not been done much
of research on how company-specific tweets affect the stock market. This thesis will
also contribute to this body of research, while also being more specific on how
Trump´s tweets affect the return of stocks.

2. Theory and methodology
In this chapter I will discuss the theory behind my thesis and the methodology I will
use to analyse the effects of President Donald Trump’s tweets on stocks. Chapter 2.1
will present the previous literature relevant to my thesis. In chapter 2.2, I will discuss
the data I obtained from twitter. Chapter 2.3 will discuss the stock market data and the
formulas used to calculate key values.

2.1.

Previous literature

At the time of writing I have only found a few studies that analyse how President
Trump´s company-specific tweets affect the company´s stock. One of them is Stock
market reactions to presidential statements: Evidence from company-specific tweets
by Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018). They reviewed tweets from November 9, 2016 to
July 31, 2017. They find that Trump´s tweets move stock prices, where tweets that
mention a company in a positive manner increase stock price ad tweets that mention a
company in a negative manner decrease stock price. They also find that President
Trump´s tweets increase trading volume, volatility, and institutional investor attention.
They found that the effect tweets have on the stock was larger before the presidential
inauguration on January 20, 2017. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) controlled for previous
news related to Trump’s tweets and found that even tweets that were preceded by other
news affected stocks.
Brans and Scholtens (2020) also analysed the impact of Trump’s company-specific
tweets on stock return in their article Under his thumb the effect of president Donald
Trump’s Twitter messages on the US stock market. Theirs is an event study that
analyses the effect of tweets that mention publicly traded companies from November
8, 2016 to November 8, 2018. They find that tweets with a negative sentiment affect
abnormal return in an economically significant way. They do not find a significant
response from other types of tweets. This indicates that the market reacts more
strongly to negative tweets.

7

Christian Hoven
In their paper Using Social Media Analytics: The Effect of President Trump's Tweets
on Companies' Performance Juma'h and Alnsour (2018) analyse if Trump’s tweets
affect major financial indexes in the USA or companies’ excess return. Their sample
period is from the middle of February 2016 to the middle of August 2017. Through
their event study they do not find significant effects of Trump’s tweets, related to
economy or finance terms, or related to individual companies, on financial indexes or
company stock return.
There is also an analysis of how Trump’s tweets affect the stock market as a whole.
Burggraf, Fendel and Huynh (2019) analysed this in their paper Political news and
stock prices: evidence from Trump’s trade war. They analysed tweets from September
14, 2018 to May 28, 2019 that mention key words related to Trump’s trade war on
China. They then used a structural vector autoregressive model to examine how these
tweets impact S&P 500 return and investor uncertainty via the VIX index. Through
their analysis Burggraf, Fendel and Huynh (2019) find that Trump’s tweets related to
the US-China trade war cause a drop in S&P 500 return and increase investor
uncertainty. The also find that the tweets have a different impact on different
industries.
There are other studies that have analysed connections between twitter and the stock
market, for example, The Wisdom of Twitter Crowds: Predicting Stock Market
Reactions to FOMC Meetings Via Twitter Feeds by Azar & Lo (2016). They analysed
if it is possible to base investment decisions on Twitter sentiment. They found that
portfolios created using twitter data can outperform a passive buy-and-hold strategy.
They analysed tweets that cite the Federal reserve that were posted around Federal
Open Markets Committee meetings. They identify Twitter sentiment by using natural
language processing techniques and assigning a polarity score to each twitter message.
This study shows that social media can have a significant effect on investments in the
stock market. Fiala, Kapounek & Veselý (2015) also studied the effects of investor
sentiment. They analysed tweets with either positive or negative sentiment towards
Apple and Microsoft. They used algorithms to identify tweets referencing the two
companies and whether the tweets were positive or negative towards these companies.
The found that Twitter sentiment affects the stock price of these companies. Bollen,
Mao, & Zeng (2011) analysed if public mood as measured from large-scale collection
of Twitter posts is correlated or even predictive of Dow Jones Industrial Average
8

Christian Hoven
values. They found that public mood can be tracked using Twitter and text processing.
Through some, but not all, methods they found that Twitter mood is predictive of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chen et al. (2014) analyse user-generated opinions
from the website Seeking Alpha, one of the largest investment-related social-media
websites in the United States according to them. They look at the frequency of negative
words in articles and comments on Seeking Alpha, and find that the frequency of
negative words in articles and comments negatively predict stock returns
My hypotheses for the results of this analysis will largely be based on the results from
Ge, Kurov & Wolfe (2018), as I expect that my analysis will have similar results
compared to theirs, unless the tweets Trump has posted after their sample period ended
have changed in nature for some reason. I believe that President Trump´s tweets will
affect the price of the stock of the company that is mentioned in the tweet. Tweets that
mention something positive about the company will increase the price of the stock,
while negative tweets will decrease the price. This will be because it is possible that
the market interprets the message in Trump´s tweets as new information, and previous
literature has found that public news releases influence the stock market and stock
prices (Brooks, Patel and Su, 2003, Chan, 2003 and Vega, 2006). Ryan and Taffler
(2004) found that news events affect the trading volume of the stocks of the companies
mentioned in these news events. In their study Neuhierl, Scherbina and Sclusche
(2013) identified that press releases, which are a type of news, increase stock volatility.
If Trump´s tweets are treated as news by investors it is likely that they will impact the
stock price, trading volume, and volatility.
There can also be more behavioural reasons behind President Trump’s tweets
influencing the stock market, like people being influenced by Trump´s opinions and
therefore changing their investment behaviour. According to Hoffmann and
Broekhuizen (2009), people can change their investment behaviour by being
influenced by other people. Chen et al. (2014) mention the Cogent Research (2008)
that states that one in four adults in the US rely on investment advice transmitted via
social media outlets. Because of this Donald Trump´s tweets may influence the
investment behaviour of many people and that, in turn, may influence the stock market.
I also believe that a tweet from Trump will increase the trading volume and the
volatility of the stock of the company that is mentioned in the tweet. This is because
he has a very large following on both of his Twitter accounts. A tweet from Trump
9

Christian Hoven
will therefore give that company increased attention, which will increase both the
trading volume (Yuan, 2015) and the stock´s volatility (Andrei and Hasler, 2014).
Yuan (2008) also found that attention causes investors to adjust their stock positions,
which will increase trading volume and may have an impact on stock prices. During
times when market makers face attention limits stocks with more attention may
experience greater liquidity (Corwin and Coughenour, 2008).
Fang and Peress (2011) found that media coverage can affect stock return even if it
does not contain any genuine news. Engelberg and Parsons (2011) also identify that
not only news, but media influences trading. The results in Sabherwal, Sarkar and
Zhangs (2011) paper show that when stocks are heavily discussed, even without that
discussion containing material news, abnormal return of those stocks is affected. This
combined with the fact that previous research found that attention alone can affect the
stock market shows that even if Trump’s tweets are not considered as news they may
still affect the stock market as long as they increase attention or media coverage, which
can be seen as a form of attention.
Based on the previous literature it is easy to see that there are many different possible
reasons for President Trump’s tweets to affect company stocks, hence it is likely that
the results in this thesis will show that Trump’s tweets affect stocks.

2.2.

Twitter data

I will gather tweets from both of President Donald Trump´s Twitter accounts:
@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. The sample period I will use is from November
9, 2016, the day Trump got elected as president, to January 31, 2020. Even though
President Trump was not inaugurated until January 20, 2017, I will include the tweets
since he was elected, as his twitter following was already strong and it was known he
would become president and would be able to affect policies in the future. During this
time there have been 811 trading days on the U.S. stock market and during the same
time Trump has tweeted about 421 different publicly traded companies that are listed
on the U.S. stock exchange. The resulting number of panel observations is 34,062.

All the companies present in this sample are listed in table A.2 in the appendix

10

Christian Hoven
During the sample period President Trump has posted 124 tweets where he mentions
a publicly traded company. This tweet number is reached after I have done as I will
describe later, and I counted multiple tweets about one company that were posted on
the same day as one tweet. I have also counted tweets where multiple companies are
mentioned as multiple tweets about a single company. Only 50 of these tweets were
posted during the trading hours of the United States stock exchange. As most of the
tweets were posted when the U.S. stock market was closed, I will use daily stock
prices, trading volume and volatility. The same decision, to focus on daily data, was
made in previous literature (Demirer and Kutan, 2010 and Ge, Kurov and Wolfe,
2018).
I will only focus on the U.S. stock market as President Trump´s decisions, policies and
opinions likely mostly affect companies that operate in the Unites States. I would also
run into a few complications if I were to include companies that are not traded in the
US. Firstly, the trading hours in other countries are different, because of time zones,
and that may change how a tweet affects a company´s stock. Secondly, and more
importantly, the stocks in other countries are traded using different currencies.
Changes in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the local currency might skew
my results. I will not have to exclude too many companies, as most of the companies
Trump has tweeted about are listed the U.S. stock market. The companies that Trump
mentioned in tweets during the sample period that are not traded on the U.S. stock
exchange are: Airbus, Bayer, BMW, Foxconn, Huawei, Hyundai, Lotte Group, Mazda,
Samsung, Softbank, Volkswagen and ZTE. Trump has tweeted about these companies
18 times. President Trump also mentioned Aetna and ESPN. These companies are
privately held companies and therefore I can´t include them in my analysis. Ge, Kurov
and Wolfe (2018) have done the only analysis of President Trump´s company-specific
tweets on the company’s stock I have found. They also chose to focus only on the U.S.
stock market.
As Trump´s relationship with the media is strained, I will not include tweets about
media companies as the effect his tweets have may be different for these companies.
It is possible that the content and nature of Trump’s tweets directed towards media
companies differs from those aimed at other companies. It is also possible that his
followers interpret the content of such tweets differently because they are aware of his
opinion about certain media outlets. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) also eliminated
11

Christian Hoven
media companies from their analysis. As I will eliminate certain tweets that mention
other companies if the main message is about a media company. Such as tweets about
the Washington Post, where Trump calls it the Amazon Washington Post or tweets
about CNN, where he mentions that AT&T is the owner of CNN.
Tweets that were posted during the time the United States stock market was closed
will be assigned to next trading day, as also done by Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018). I
will do this because that is the day investors will be able to trade on the tweets and the
possible new information they may contain. There are instances when President Trump
posts multiple tweets about the same company on a single day. For example, the
following tweets about Amazon on March 31, 2018. “While we are on the subject, it
is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it
delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times
reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that...“ and
“...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and
should so REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs
would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real
costs (and taxes) now!”. That message was split into two tweets, because the message
is too long for one tweet. This can happen when a single message is split into multiple
tweets, due to the restrictions on tweet length, or because Trump posts two different
tweets about the same company during one day. In these cases, I will again follow the
example of Ge, Kurov, and Wolfe (2018), and count those tweets as a single tweet as
the effects of these tweets will be combined in the daily data. In the case where a single
tweet mentions two different companies, I will essentially count that tweet as two
tweets, one for each company. This is important in cases where the message of the
tweet is positive towards one company and negative towards the other, such as a tweet
about Boeing and Lockheed Martin on December 22, 2016. “Based on the tremendous
cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out
a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!”. In that tweet the message is positive about Boeing
and negative about Lockheed Martin. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) did the same with
tweets that mention multiple companies in their paper.
I will also classify tweets as either positive or negative. This will be done based on the
message in the tweet and whether it has a positive or negative tone towards the
company. For example, the following tweet about Rexnord on December 2, 2016 is
12

Christian Hoven
negative towards the company. “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather
viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No
more!”. While this tweet about Ford from January 4, 2016 is positive. “Thank you to
Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This
is just the beginning - much more to follow”. Most previous studies on impact of social
media on the stock market analyse big data. They look at a large number of messages
and posts from multiple people. They aim to extract an overall sentiment of market
participants from the data. As a result of this they cannot take into account the actual
content of the messages and posts and the context in which these were made. In
contrast to this, I will read each tweet and manually assign either a positive or a
negative value based on the message and context of the tweets towards the company.
This is possible because I only look at posts from one user, and therefore the amount
of posts is much lower. I determine if the tone of the tweet is positive or negative
towards the company in the same way that Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) have done in
their study. Tweets that are about jobs will be classified as positive if Trump applauds
a company for keeping jobs in the USA or bringing them back from abroad. This is
based on the fact that this has been an important issue for President Trump, as he stated
in the 2016 Republican primary debate in South Carolina: “I'm going to bring jobs
back from China. I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where
they're all every country throughout the world now Vietnam, that's the new one.”. On
the other hand, tweets about companies that move jobs out of the USA will be
classified as negative.
Tweets about government cost will be classified as positive if the content of the tweet
suggests that the company may help reduce government costs. If a tweet is about
companies whose good or service the government purchases at high cost it is classified
as negative. This is because Trump will not want to spend unnecessary government
funds and his promises to reduce federal debt. Trump stated “We’ve got to get rid of
the $19 trillion in debt” during an interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa
on April 3, 2016.
There are of course many tweets about different subjects than those mentioned above.
In these cases, I will classify the tweets based on the general tone of the tweet and
whether the message it contains is positive or negative towards the company. Whether
a tweet has been classified as positive or negative is shown in table A.1 in the appendix.

Stock market data

I have gathered all the company stock data from Yahoo! Finance. The market data
(stock market return, risk free return, small-minus-big market capitalization and highminus-low book-to-market ratio) I have taken from Kenneth French´s website. As I
will use daily data in my analysis, the data I have collected is also in daily data.

This table shows the summary statistics for the stock data from the sample period (9 November 2016
to 31 January 2020). All values are for daily data. Return and abnormal return values are in
percentages

Compared to the data in Ge, Kurov and Wolfe’s (2018) paper, the standard deviation
in my sample is higher across the board indicating a more volatile market during my
sample period. The extremes are also higher and lower respectively in my data. Both
the mean and the median for abnormal return and absolute value abnormal return are
higher in my dataset than that from Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018), which is no surprise
as the stock market has performed well since Trump became president. The median
and mean of abnormal trading volume are lower in my data, while those values for
volatility are higher compared the data of Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018).

2.3.1. Abnormal return
To obtain abnormal return, I will first calculate the daily return for each stock in
percentage terms using the closing price, using the following formula

14

Christian Hoven

𝑅𝑖𝑡 =

𝐶𝑖𝑡 − 𝐶𝑖𝑡−1
𝐶𝑖𝑡−1

(1)

Where Rit is the return and Cit is the closing price. I will then calculate excess return
(ERit) as return minus risk free return (RFit).
𝐸𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝑅𝑖𝑡 − 𝑅𝐹𝑡

(2)

I will then estimate the standard Fama-French three-factor model (Fama and French,
1993), in the same way that Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) did. To keep my model more
comparable to the one Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) used I will not be using the FamaFrench five-factor model (Fama and French, 2015) even though the five-factor model
has the potential to control for more variables.
I will use an OLS regression according to the following equation.
𝐸𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 (𝑅𝑀𝑡 − 𝑅𝐹𝑡 ) + 𝛽2 𝑆𝑀𝐵𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐻𝑀𝐿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

(3)

Where ERit is excess return, RMt is the stock market return, RFt is risk free return,
SMBt is small-minus-big market capitalization and HMLt is high-minus-low book-tomarket ratio. Estimating the excess return like this will allow me to calculate abnormal
return. I will use the coefficients from the regression above in the formula below to
calculate the abnormal return for each company.
𝐴𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝐸𝑅𝑖𝑡 − [𝛽0 + 𝛽1 (𝑅𝑀𝑡 − 𝑅𝐹𝑡 ) + 𝛽2 𝑆𝑀𝐵𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐻𝑀𝐿𝑡 ]

(4)

The reason I will use abnormal return instead of simply using return is because
abnormal return controls for market movement, while return does not.
In his paper, MacKinlay (1997) recommends that one does not use the same estimation
and event window, nor should they overlap. If the event and estimation windows
overlap the events that are studied may affect the estimation and skew the results.
Because of this recommendation I will be using data from the 9 November 2015 to the
8 November 2016 to estimate excess return and ensure the events in the sample used
for the rest of the study do not affect the estimation. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) also
did this, but they opted for a shorter time period for the estimation, while I chose to
include the entire year prior to the event window.

2.3.2. Abnormal trading volume
Abnormal volume is reached by dividing the difference between trading volume for a
given day and the average trading volume of the entire sample period by the average
trading volume of the entire sample period, as done by Joseph, Wintoki and Zhang
(2011).
𝐴𝑉𝑖𝑡 = (𝑉𝑖𝑡 − 𝑉𝑖,𝑎𝑣𝑔 )/𝑉𝑖,𝑎𝑣𝑔

(5)

Vit is the trading volume for company i on day t and Vi,avg is the average daily volume
over the entire sample period for company i.
Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) calculated abnormal trading volume by dividing the
difference between trading volume for a given day and the average trading volume of
the previous five days by the average trading volume of the previous five days. I won´t
use this method because there are instances where a company is mentioned in President
Trump´s tweets more than once within a five-day period. This may lead to a situation
where the five-day average trading volume for the second tweet is higher than first
tweet within five days, as the five-day average trading volume for the second tweet
includes the increase in trading volume from the first tweet. In this case the abnormal
trading volume for the second tweet calculated by this method would be lower than it
actually is. Therefore, results using this method might be skewed downward.

2.3.3. Volatility
To calculate volatility, I will use a method proposed by Rogers and Satchell (1991).
𝜎𝑖𝑡2 = (𝐻𝑖𝑡 − 𝐶𝑖𝑡 )(𝐻𝑖𝑡 − 𝑂𝑖𝑡 ) + (𝐿𝑖𝑡 − 𝐶𝑖𝑡 )(𝐿𝑖𝑡 − 𝑂𝑖𝑡 )

(6)

Where σit2 is the variance and Hit, Lit, Cit and Oit are the natural logarithms of the high,
low, closing, and opening prices of the stock. I will take the square root out of the
variance to get the standard deviation and then multiply that value by 100 to get
volatility. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) made the same calculations to get the volatility
of the stock in their paper. Calculating volatility this way is advantageous compared
to more commonly used ways, as those only give one value for volatility over the entire
sample period. The method used here, developed by Rodgers and Satchell (1991) gives
16

Christian Hoven
a volatility value for each day, which is needed to estimate the effects of President
Donald Trump´s tweets on volatility when using daily data.

2.4.

Empirical model

The method I will use for my analysis is based on the method Ge, Kurov and Wolfe
(2018) used in their paper Stock market reactions to presidential statements:
Evidence from company-specific tweets. They analyse the effects of President Trump´s
tweets that mention publicly traded companies, on stock prices, trading volume,
volatility, and institutional investor attention. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) acquire
their results by using OLS regressions with fixed effects for each company. In their
basic model they only include the Twitter variable as an independent variable. They
also use an OLS regression with a dummy variable for the time period before Trump´s
inauguration as President and term interacting the Twitter variable and the preinauguration dummy, which has the value one for the time before Trump was
inaugurated as President of the United States. In my analysis I will also use an OLS
regression with fixed effects for each company. I will use the fixed effects because it
will help me to control for omitted variable bias. The use of fixed effects will control
for all variables that don´t change over time. What will differentiate my analysis from
that of Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) is that I will include a dummy variable for tweets
that were posted during the opening hours of the U.S. stock exchange. I will do this
because Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found that stock prices reverse during the
following trading days after a tweet and that the increase in trading volume usually
reverts to normal levels quite fast. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) suggested that future
research could analyse whether certain industries are more influenced by tweets than
others and if company size plays a role in the effect a tweet has on the company´s
stock. I will include separate dummy variables for companies that operate in the
defence industry, the automobile industry, and the banking sector, because they are
dependent on government contracts or may be dependent on government bailouts. I
will be taking company size into account by using total annual revenue as a proxy,
because total revenue is often used to describe how large a company is. I will use the
total revenue value from the day after it was reported until the total revenue for the
17

Christian Hoven
following year is reported. As is often done in previous research, I will use the natural
logarithm of total annual revenue. I won´t include institutional investor attention in my
analysis, as I want to focus more on return, trading volume and volatility. These values
are more commonly used while making investment decisions and are likely more
important to the companies themselves.
The sample period Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) use is from November 9, 2016 to July
31, 2017. During this time there were 181 trading days on the U.S. stock exchange. In
their sample they have 19 companies. My sample period will be from November 8,
2016 to January 31, 2020. This will increase the number of trading days during the
sample period to 811. In my sample period Trump tweeted about 42 different
companies. This means that I have a much larger sample than Ge, Kurov and Wolfe
(2018) did.
Even though I use a fixed effects model there is still a risk that some omitted variables
may affect my results. One concern may be other news sources reporting the same
information that is contained within Trump´s tweets. These other sources may be what
influence the stock. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) tested this and found that tweets that
were not preceded by other news sources had a larger effect on the stock than tweets
that were preceded by other news sources. They also state that there is evidence
indicating that Trump´s tweets have an effect even when there is preceding news about
the company. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) controlled for preceding news by searching
for news on and before the day of a tweet on the Factiva global news database. They
then use the same regressions they had done before, but only used tweets that were an
original source of news (not preceded by other news).
As the methodology used in this thesis can be classed as an event study, I will discuss
event studies and their benefits and potential drawbacks.
An event study is a statistical technique that estimates the stock price impact
of occurrences such as mergers, earnings announcements, and so forth. The
basic notion is to disentangle the effects of two types of information on stock
prices – information that is specific to the firm under question (e.g., dividend
announcement) and information that is likely to affect stock prices marketwide
(e.g., change in interest rates). (Mitchell and Netter, 1994)

18

Christian Hoven
A tweet from Trump about a company is most likely going to fall under the category
“information that is specific to the firm under question” mentioned by Mitchell and
Netter (1994). According to MacKinlay (1997), who also states that an event study
measures the impact of a specific event, some of the most successful event studies
have been in the area of finance typically focusing on abnormal return. Binder (1998)
also found that event studies are good as they show statistical power and wide
applicability. This is a good sign for the validity of this thesis as that description would
also fit this research. Mackinlay (1997) also states that it is important for an event
study to precisely identify the date of the event. In the case of this thesis it has been
easy to do that. All tweets posted have a timestamp, thus it is possible to know not
only what day the tweets were posted, but what minute. As the tweets are the events
in this study, it is very much possible to identify the precise date, and time, of the
event. Other key factors for an event study is that the event is unexpected, and the
information is freely available to the market. Trump’s tweets are both unexpected and
freely available for anyone to read. Brans and Scholtens (2020) agree with this.

2.4.1. Abnormal return
When analysing how President Donald Trump´s tweets affect stock market return I
will be using a fixed effects panel model.
𝐴𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼3 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼4 𝐼𝑡 + 𝛼5 𝐼𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼6 𝑆𝑖𝑡

(7)

+ 𝜃𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
Where ARit is abnormal return, Tit is the Twitter variable, It is the dummy variable for
post-inauguration, Sit is the indicator for company size and θi are company specific
fixed effects. I will also include a dummy variable for tweets posted during the trading
hours of the U.S. stock exchange (SOit). I will include this variable because I expect
tweets posted when the U.S. stock exchange is closed to have a lower effect on the
abnormal return than tweets posted during the opening hours of the U.S. stock
exchange. I expect this to be the case because Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found that
the effect of Trump´s tweets on stock prices is temporary and reverses during the
following days after the tweet. This reversal effect may already happen before the
market opens as initial overreaction from investors may not be as large if they have
19

Christian Hoven
had time to process the information in the tweets while the market is closed. I will also
include interaction terms between the Twitter variable and both the dummy for tweets
posted post-inauguration and tweets posted during the trading hours of the U.S. stock
exchange. This is a similar model used by Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018), though they
didn’t include a dummy variable for tweets posted outside the opening hours of the
U.S. stock exchange, nor did they use an indicator for company size. Additionally, I
will include variables for companies operating in the defence2 and automobile3
industries and the banking4 sector as well as interaction terms between these variables
and the Twitter variable. I will also include the first three lags of abnormal return as
control variables.

2.4.2. Abnormal trading volume
In determining the effect of Trump´s tweets on trading volume of a company´s stock,
I use abnormal trading volume. To determine this effect, I estimate a fixed effects
panel model.
𝐴𝑉𝑖𝑡 = 𝛾0 + 𝛾1 |𝑇𝑖𝑡 | + 𝛾2 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾3 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾4 𝐼𝑡 + 𝛾5 𝐼𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾6 𝑆𝑖𝑡

(8)

+ 𝜃𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
Where 𝜃 i are company-specific fixed effects, It is the post-inauguration dummy and Sit
is the indicator for company size. I will also use a dummy variable for tweets that were
posted during the time the U.S. stock exchange was open (SOit). I will be doing this,
because Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found that the spike in trading volume usually
doesn´t last very long. Therefore, tweets posted during the opening hours of the U.S.
stock market might have a larger effect on trading volume than those posted when the
market is closed. As control variables I will also include the first three lags of abnormal
trading volume. The Twitter variable, Tit, will be absolute as I expect both positive and
negative tweets to increase trading volume. Ryan and Taffler (2004) did not classify
news as positive or negative in their analysis. Therefore, I will also expect President
Trump´s tweets, both positive and negative, to increase trading volume. Furthermore,
the model I have built is not suited for differentiating between positive and negative
2

Christian Hoven
tweets and how they affect trading volume. If I would not use an absolute of the twitter
variable and γ1 is positive, as I expect it will be, negative tweets would reduce trading
volume. This would contradict previous research, and reason.

2.4.3. Volatility
To estimate the effect of Trump´s tweets on volatility, I use a similar model as for
estimating the effect on trading volume.
𝜎𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿0 + 𝛿1 |𝑇𝑖𝑡 | + 𝛿2 𝜎𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛿3 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾3 𝑆𝑂𝑖𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾4 𝐼𝑡 + 𝛾5 𝐼𝑡 × 𝑇𝑖𝑡

(9)

+ 𝛾6 𝑆𝑖𝑡 + 𝜃𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
Where σit stands for volatility, SOit stands for the dummy for tweets posted during the
opening hours of the stock market, It stands for the post-inauguration dummy and Sit
is the company size indicator. As with trading volume the twitter variable is absolute.
Neuhierl, Scherbina and Sclusche (2013) did not differ between positive and negative
press releases and found that press releases increase volatility, therefore I will expect
to find that both positive and negative tweets increase volatility. That is why I use the
absolute value of the Twitter variable. The model is not suitable to differentiate
between positive and negative tweets for the reasons described in the previous section
about abnormal trading volume. I will include the first three lags of volatility in the
model to account for persistence of volatility. Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) used a
similar model.

3. Results
In this chapter I will present the results of the regressions presented on chapter 2.4. In
chapter 3.1 I will present the results for the effect of Trump’s tweets on abnormal
return. Chapter 3.2 will present the results for the effect of Trump’s tweets on abnormal
trading volume. Finally, in chapter 3.3 I will present the results for the effect of
Trump’s tweets on volatility.

3.1.

Abnormal return

Table 3.1 summarises the effects President Donald Trump’s tweets have on abnormal
return using fixed effects models, with fixed effects for the 42 companies in the
sample. Model 1 is the same used by Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) in their basic model
and Model 2 is the same they used to control for the differences between the time
before and after Trump was sworn in as president. Model 3 adds a dummy variable for
tweets posted within the opening hours of the U.S. stock market and natural logarithm
of total revenue. In Model 4 I have included the three first lags of abnormal return as
control variables for momentum. In all the models the effect of the Twitter variable on
abnormal return is statistically significant with a positive coefficient. This indicates
that Trump’s tweets affect abnormal return. This is in line with my hypothesis and
with what Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found. Taking the coefficient of model 1 as an
example, a positive tweet would increase abnormal return by 2.26 percent on average,
while a negative tweet would decrease abnormal return by 2.26 percent on average.
This value is quite a bit higher than the 0.635 percent Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018)
found. The coefficient in Model 3 and 4 is much closer to Ge, Kurov and Wolfe’s
(2018) value. As shown in Table 2.1, the standard deviation of abnormal return for the
sample is 1.8521 percent. Therefore, the coefficients for the Twitter variable are also
economically significant.
The interaction term between the inauguration dummy and the Twitter variable is also
statistically significantly. Surprisingly, the coefficient is negative. This indicates that
tweets Trump posted before he was sworn in as president have a smaller effect on
abnormal return. This contradicts the results from Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018). This
may be due to that Trump’s tweet have had a greater effect on abnormal return after
the sample period of Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) ended.
The interaction term between the dummy variable for tweets posted during the trading
hours of the stock market and the Twitter variable is statistically significant with a
positive coefficient. This is in line with my hypothesis, as it indicates that tweets posted
when the stock market was open had a greater effect on abnormal return than tweets
posted when the stock market was closed.

22

Christian Hoven
Because there are interaction terms, which include the Twitter variable that are
statistically significant in Model 2, 3 and 4, there is some uncertainty about the
importance of the Twitter variable in these models. Still, the results show that Trump’s
tweets affect abnormal return, the effect being smaller for tweets posted before he was
sworn in as president and larger for tweets posted when the stock market was open.
The R-squared value is rather low in all models, and therefore the omitted variable
bias may be quite high. The same is the case for the models in chapter 3.1.1., 3.1.2.,
and 3.1.3.
The inauguration dummy, which equals one before Trump was sworn in as president,
is statistically significant in all models where it is present. The same is true for the
logarithm of total annual revenue.

3.1.1. Automobile industry
The models I have used to obtain the results presented in table 3.3 are the same as
Model 3 and 4 in the previous chapter, except that I have added a dummy variable for
the automotive industry and an interaction term between the dummy variable for the
automotive industry and the Twitter variable. The dummy variable for the automotive
industry has the value one for companies that operate in the automotive industry and

24

Christian Hoven
zero for all other companies. The automotive dummy variable is omitted from the
regression because its effects are already captured in the company-fixed effects.
Similarly, as for the regression without an automotive dummy, the Twitter variable is
statistically significant, but this time the coefficient is negative. The interaction term
between the inauguration dummy and the Twitter variable is also statistically
significant and the coefficient for that interaction term is positive, which means that
tweets posted before Trump was inaugurated as president have more of an effect on
abnormal return than those posted after his inauguration. The interaction term between
the automotive dummy and the Twitter variable is statistically significant and the
coefficient is positive. Even though the coefficient for the Twitter variable itself is
negative the coefficient of the interaction term between the automotive dummy and
the Twitter variable compensates for this. The aggregated coefficient of these two
variables is 0.05552, which is much larger than the coefficient for the twitter variable
when the automotive dummy was not included. This number is again economically
significant.
These results indicate that tweets about companies in the automotive industry have a
greater effect on abnormal return than tweets about other companies, which is in line
with my hypothesis. As two interaction terms that include the Twitter variable are
highly significant in these models, the importance of the Twitter variable itself is
uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, the coefficient for the Twitter variable being
negative does not necessarily mean that positive tweets about companies in other
industries than automobile decrease abnormal return.

3.1.2. Banking sector
The inclusion of an interaction term between a banking sector dummy and the Twitter
variable yields some interesting results as shown in table 3.3. The dummy for the
banking sector is omitted because of collinearity with the fixed effects. The interaction
26

Christian Hoven
term itself is not statistically significant, but what is more interesting is that the
inclusion of this variable does not change the significance and barely changes the
coefficients of the other variables in the model compared to the results in table 3.1.
This indicates that the abnormal return of companies operating in the banking sector
is not affected differently than that of companies operating in different industries.
These findings may not be very reliable as there are only two companies in my sample
which operate in the banking sector, but still indicate that the abnormal return of
companies in the banking sector are not affected differently by Trump’s tweets than
others in my sample.

3.1.3. Defence industry
Table 3.5 shows the effects Trump’s tweets have on abnormal return when controlling
for companies operating in the defence industry. Otherwise the models are the same
as Model 3 and 4 in table 3.1. The Twitter variable is statistically significant in both
28

Christian Hoven
models and has positive coefficients. The same is the case for the interaction term
between the dummy for tweets posted during the opening hours of the stock market
and the Twitter variable, while the interaction term between the pre-inauguration
dummy and the Twitter variable is statistically significant with a negative coefficient.
This has the same implications as the results in chapter 3.1. Tweets affect abnormal
return, where tweets posted during the opening hours of the stock market and after
Trump was inaugurated have a larger effect.
The dummy variable for defence industry is omitted because of collinearity with the
fixed effects. The interaction term between the defence industry dummy and the
Twitter variable is statistically significant and negative. This does not necessarily mean
that positive Tweets about companies in the defence industry decrease abnormal
return, as the coefficient for the Twitter variable is positive. The effect of the Twitter
variable and the interaction term between the defence industry dummy and the Twitter
variable very nearly cancel each other out. The aggregated coefficient of these two
variables is -0.0031, which is a very small effect.
Because of the statistical significance of the interaction term between the defence
industry and the Twitter variable the importance of the Twitter variable itself is
uncertain. The results in table 3.5 indicate that tweets about companies in the defence
industry affect the abnormal return less than tweets about companies in other
industries, which is surprising as the defence industry only can sell to the US
government or to others with the permission from the US government. On the other
hand, the defence budget for the US is very large, almost 732 billion U.S. dollars in
20195, and somewhat guarantees a steady cash flow for companies in the defence
industry.
There are limitations to these results as two of the three companies in my sample
operating in the defence industry, Boeing and Navistar, also operate in other industries.
This may have skewed the results.

Abnormal trading volume

Table 3.6 presents the effects Trump’s tweets have on abnormal trading volume.
Model 1 and 2 are the same that Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) used in their analysis.
30

Christian Hoven
Model 3 includes a dummy for tweets posted when the stock market was open and the
natural logarithm of total revenue as a control variable. Model 4 further includes the
first three lags of abnormal trading volume as control variables for momentum. In this
model the Twitter variable is absolute, which means that there is no longer a distinction
between positive and negative tweets. This is done because previous research has not
made a distinction between positive and negative tweets or pieces of news in similar
models.
There is no interaction term between the dummy for tweets posted during the opening
hours of the stock market and the Twitter variable, because as the Twitter variable is
absolute the interaction term and the stock market open dummy variable are identical.
In Model 1 and 2 the Twitter variable is highly statistically significant with a positive
coefficient. Taking Model 1 as an example, a tweet from Trump increases abnormal
trading volume by 60.6 percent on average. This effect is also economically significant
as the standard deviation of absolute abnormal trading volume is 60.44 percent, as
shown in Table 2.1. These results are similar to those of Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018),
except that the coefficients in my results are about twice as large in Model 1 and one
and a half times larger in Model 2. What differs from the results of Ge, Kurov and
Wolfe (2018) is that the coefficient of the interaction term between the preinauguration dummy and the Twitter variable is negative. This means that tweets
posted before the Trump’s inauguration had a lower effect on trading volume, while
Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found that these tweets had a higher impact on trading
volume. This indicates that the tweets Trump posted after their sample period have had
a greater effect on abnormal trading volume.
The statistical significance for the Twitter variable drops in Model 3 and 4, as does the
coefficient. This is due to the inclusion of the dummy variable for tweets posted when
the stock market was open, which is the same as the interaction term between that
variable and the Twitter variable. That variable is highly statistically significant with
a high coefficient. As the statistical significance for the Twitter variable disappears in
Model 4 it may be that only tweets posted when the stock market is open affect
abnormal trading volume. However, that model also includes two variables that are
interaction terms with the Twitter variable, so the importance of the Twitter variable
is uncertain.
31

Christian Hoven
The results from these models indicate that Trump’s tweets posted during the opening
hours of the U.S. stock market increase abnormal trading volume, while other tweets
also may increase abnormal trading volume. Tweets posted before Trump was sworn
in as president seem to have a smaller effect on trading volume.
The low R-squared value in all models may be of concern as it means there could exist
an omitted variable bias.

3.3.

Volatility

Table 3.7 presents the effects President Trump’s tweets have on volatility. These
models are the same as in previous chapters, except that the dependent variable is
volatility and the lags are of volatility.
Model 1 and 2 are again the same as the models Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) used.
According to Model 1 a tweet from Trump increases volatility by 0.372 on average.
My findings in these models are similar to theirs, except that the coefficients in my
models are larger and the coefficient of the interaction term between the preinauguration dummy and the Twitter variable is negative. This indicates that tweets
posted after the sample period of Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) have had a larger impact
on volatility. Though this interaction term is not statistically significant, and the results
are therefore uncertain.
On the other hand, the dummy for tweets posted when the stock market was open in
Model 3 and 4 is statistically significant and is identical with the interaction term of
the stock market dummy and the Twitter variable. Because the Twitter variable is no
longer significant when this interaction term is included in the model, it seems that
only tweets that are posted during the opening hours of the stock market increase
volatility. This effect is economically significant as the standard deviation for volatility
is 1.1675, as shown in Table 2.1. Because there is an interaction term that includes the
Twitter variable in Model 3 and 4, the importance of the Twitter variable is uncertain.
The results from these Models indicate that tweets that Trump posts during the opening
hours of the U.S. stock market increase volatility. Other tweets may also increase
volatility. There does not seem to be any difference between tweets posted before and
after Trump was sworn in as president.
The R-squared value is quite low in all models, therefore there may exist an omitted
variable bias.

Discussion

Even though President Trump’s tweets may not always seem to be particularly thought
out, there must be some sort of reasoning behind them. The choices Trump makes
when deciding which companies to tweet about are bound to affect the sample of
companies in this thesis. There also has to be some reasoning behind when he tweets.
Even though the sample of companies in this thesis is quite large, it is likely not a
perfect representation of the market as a whole. This is because Trump has most likely
34

Christian Hoven
chosen to tweet about these companies, not selected them at random. As many of the
tweets Trump has posted that mention companies centre around jobs or production
outside of the U.S., there is a bias towards companies that produce physical goods.
There are particularly many companies operating in the automobile industry. Still, the
companies in this thesis operate in varied industries and are of different sizes.
Therefore, the results should give a good indication of how Trump’s tweets affect the
average company, especially those companies Trump chooses to tweet about. The
results for the different industries (automobile, defence, and banking) will give a better
picture of how Trump’s tweets affect those types of companies. Especially the results
for the automobile industry should be rather accurate as the sample of eight companies
is the largest of the three industries I analysed.
Then there is the question of the timing of the tweets. Again, there has to be some
reason why he posts when he does. Some of the tweets may have been posted on days
where the same information about the company was published via other sources. This
should not affect the results too much, as Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018) found that
Trump’s tweets have an effect even when news preceded the tweet. There are also
tweets which most likely were not preceded by news. For example, tweets where
Trump mentions a meeting he had with the CEO of the company. The timing of the
tweets should not pose to large a problem.
Unless Trump changes the way he decides when and about what companies to tweet,
future tweets will likely have similar effects as those analysed in this thesis.
Despite the fact that Trump does decide when, why, and about what company he
tweets, his tweets are still an exogenous variable in the context of this analysis. It is
unlikely that either abnormal return, abnormal trading volume or volatility determine
when or about which company Trump tweets.
According to Corrado (2011), event-induced variance may be an issue in event studies
where the sample is not the entire population. In the case of this study, where the
sample is 42 companies, the sample is not the entire population as there are many more
companies traded on the US stock exchange. This means that the results may have
been affected by event-induced variance. That should not detract from the overall
validity of the results as event-induced variance mostly skews the standard errors
(Harrington and Shrider, 2007).
35

Christian Hoven
A limitation to this study is that I have manually collected all the tweets as well as
stock and market data. Because of this there is the possibility of errors in the data
collection process. This could have led to exclusion of events from the dataset.
Based on the results in this thesis President Trump should consider being careful when
tweeting about companies, especially when the content of those tweets is negative. A
negative tweet from Trump may have negative consequences for a company, as I have
found that negative tweets decrease abnormal return. Investors may place greater
weight on bad news in certain scenarios (Williams, 2015), which means that the
potential detrimental effects of such tweets may be larger than my estimates. Not only
Trump, but also other high-ranking officials with a similar potential to influence
people’s investment behaviour should take into consideration how their public
statements can affect companies. Celebrities should also take this into consideration
as their endorsement affects stocks (Agrawal and Kamakura, 1995). Risk seeking
investors may want to use the results in this thesis to trade on stocks when Trump posts
a company-specific tweet by identifying whether the tweet is positive or negative and
then either buying or shorting the stock. Though this seems like a risky trade strategy.
Nearly all results in this thesis are in line with my hypotheses and with previous
research from Ge, Kurov and Wolfe (2018). The only exceptions are that tweets have
a smaller, not larger, impact before Trump’s inauguration and that the abnormal return
of companies in the defence industry is affected less be Trump’s tweets than other
companies in the sample. There are, however, completely reasonable explanations
behind those results. There is some previous research that did not find that Trump’s
tweets impact stocks, but they used smaller and older samples or different methods.
I have contributed to the existing body of research by examining if there is a difference
between tweets that are posted during our outside of the opening hours of the U.S.
stock market and if there is a difference how companies operating in the automobile
and defence industry and in the banking sector are impacted by Trump’s tweets. I have
also significantly increased the sample period and controlled for company size and
momentum. With the help of this thesis the understanding of how President Trump’s
tweeting behaviour affects stocks is significantly increased. This thesis also expands
our knowledge of how social media can impact financial markets. This thesis provides
more information on how the social media posts of a single, albeit very influential,
36

Christian Hoven
person can impact the stock market. As this thesis is a type of event study, that body
of research has also been expanded. Though I must admit that I doubt any major leaps
have been made in that area.
Future research could investigate how other industries than those mentioned in this
thesis are affected by Trump’s tweets. There may also be other firm-level attributes
that change the impact of Trump’s tweets. For example, if the company also operates
outside of the USA or not. How companies of different size are affected could also be
examined, as this research only controlled for company size, but did not examine if
companies of different sizes are affected differently. Finding out how long the effects
of Trump’s tweets last is also something that could be of interest to future research.
Finding suitable control variables that would increase the value of R-squared and thus
improve the validity of the results could be important to future research on this topic.
Controlling for news events that precede a tweet from Trump is also something future
research could look into. As event-induced variance may influence the results of event
studies, it would be beneficial for future research to control for event-induced variance.
As Williams (2015) found that negative news influences investors more than positive
news in certain scenarios it could be interesting if future research into this topic were
to analyse if that is also the case for the impact of Trump’s company-specific tweets.
As Trump’s tweets reach investors quickly and market therefore may react to them
quickly, future research could benefit from using more high frequency data.

4. Conclusion
The New York Stock Exchange happens to be the biggest casino in the world.
The only thing that makes it different from the average casino is that the players
dress in blue pinstripe suits and carry leather briefcases. (Trump, 1987,
Trump: The Art of the Deal)
In this thesis I have attempted to investigate how tweets where President Trump
mentions a company affect the abnormal return, abnormal trading volume, and
volatility of the stock of the company mentioned in the tweet. As I have identified that
Trump’s company-specific tweets affect stocks, The New York Stock Exchange may
not be a casino after all.
37

Christian Hoven
As the research in this thesis has demonstrated Trump’s company-specific tweets
affect abnormal trading volume. Tweets that are positive towards the company
increase abnormal return, while tweets that are negative towards the company have the
opposite effect. Before Trump was inaugurated the affect of tweets was smaller,
compared to after his inauguration. Tweets posted during the opening hours of the
stock market have a greater impact on abnormal return than those posted outside of
the opening hours. Companies operating in the automobile industry experience a
greater impact, than the rest of the companies in the sample, on abnormal return after
a tweet from Trump, while companies operating in the defence industry experience a
smaller impact. The results indicate that companies in the banking sector are affected
the same as the other companies in the sample.
All of Trump’s company-specific tweets that are posted during the trading hours
increase abnormal trading volume and all other of Trump’s company-specific tweets
may increase abnormal trading volume. As was the case for abnormal return, tweets
posted after Trump’s inauguration have a great effect on abnormal trading volume than
those posted before his inauguration.
The results for Trump’s company-specific tweets effects on volatility are similar to
those on abnormal trading volume. All company-specific tweets posted when the stock
exchange was closed may increase volatility, and tweets posted when the stock
exchange was open do increase volatility. Again, tweets posted before Trump’s
inauguration have a smaller impact on volatility than those posted after his
inauguration.
All of the ways Trump’s tweets impact stocks mentioned above are not only
statistically, but also economically significant. A tweet from Trump can not only
generate a large amount of trading volume and volatility, but also has the potential to
increase or decrease a company’s stock value by millions of U.S. dollars.

Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Påverkar president Donald Trumps tweetar aktiemarknaden? En analys
av företagsspecifika tweetar.
Donald J. Trump, USA:s 45:e president är känd för att ofta kommunicera med
allmänheten via Twitter. Som USA:s president är Trump en av världens mäktigaste
och mest inflytelserika personer. Det betyder att han kan påverka många människors
val och beteende. De åsikter och tankar han publicerar i sina tweetar kan alltså påverka
investerares beteende på aktiemarknaden. Det är även möjligt att Trumps tweetar
innehåller ny information, om till exempel handelstariffer och statskontrakt, som kan
ha en effekt på aktier.
På grund av inflytandet Trumps tweetar kan ha på aktiemarknaden är det intressant att
undersöka hur tweetar där han nämner ett börsnoterat företag påverkar det företagets
aktie. Att veta hur Trumps företagsspecifika tweetar påverkar företagets aktie är även
intressant eftersom Trump tweetar så ofta. Att veta hur Trumps tweetar påverkar aktier
kan hjälpa honom och andra inflytelserika personer att se över när de laddar upp
tweetar och hurdant meddelande de innehåller för att minska på risken att företag gör
förluster. För investerare är det intressant att veta hur Trumps tweetar påverkar aktier,
eftersom investerare då kan reagera på Trumps tweetar på ett optimalt sätt för att öka
på vinster, eller minska på förluster.
Den här avhandlingen baserar sig på en undersökning gjord av Ge, Kurov och Wolfe
(2018). De undersökte också om Trumps tweetar där han nämner företag har en effekt
på företagets aktie. De kom fram till att Trumps tweetar påverkar avkastning,
handelsvolym, volatilitet och uppmärksamhet från institutionella investerare. De fann
att positiva tweetar ökar avkastningen, negativa tweetar sänker avkastningen och alla
tweetar ökar på handelsvolym, volatilitet och uppmärksamhet från institutionella
investerare. Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018) gjorde sin undersökning betydligt tidigare i
Trumps presidentskap än då den här avhandlingen skrevs och har därför ett mindre
sampel.

39

Christian Hoven
I skrivande stund finns det ingen annan tidigare forskning som undersöker effekten av
Trumps tweetar på aktier. Det finns dock annan forskning som tangerar ämnet och kan
stöda teorin bakom varför Trumps tweetar påverkar aktier. Bland annat Azar och Lo
(2016) och Fiala, Kapounek och Veselý (2015) har kommit fram till att man genom att
analysera stora mängder meddelanden på sociala medier, bland annat Twitter, kan se
att dessa meddelanden har en effekt på aktiemarknaden. Sociala medier kan alltså ha
en effekt på aktiemarknaden och det går att analysera rörelser på aktiemarknaden med
hjälp av sociala medier. Tidigare forskning har också kommit fram till att nyheter
påverkar aktiepris (Chan, 2003 och Vega, 2006), handelsvolym (Ryan och
Taffler,2004) och volatilitet (Neuhierl, Scherbina och Sclusche, 2013). Ifall
investerare tolkar de meddelanden som Trump skriver i sina tweetar som nyheter är
det möjligt att Trumps tweetar påverkar aktiepris, handelsvolym och volatilitet. Det
finns även forskning som kommit fram till att människors investeringsbeteende kan
påverkas av andra människor, så som vänner och familj (Hoffman och Broekhuizen,
2009), och att en av fyra amerikaner använder sig av investeringsråd som publicerade
på sociala medier (Chen et al., 2014).
I den här avhandlingen har tweetar från båda President Trumps båda officiella
twitterkonton, @realDonaldTrump och @POTUS, samlats under sampelperioden från
den 9 november 2016 till den 31 januari 2020. På grund av att de flesta tweetar har
laddats upp då USA:s börs var stängd har jag använt dagliga data i min analys. Trump
har vid flera tillfällen laddat upp flera tweetar som nämner samma företag under
samma dag och laddat upp sådana tweetar där han nämner flera olika företag i samma
tweet. På grund detta har jag räknat flera tweetar under samma dag om samma företag
som en tweet och en tweet om flera företag som en tweet per företag som nämns. Jag
har även klassat tweetar som antingen positiva eller negativa gentemot företaget
baserat på budskapet i dem. Eftersom Trump har ett dåligt förhållande med medier,
som tidningar och nyhetsstationer har jag lämnat bort tweetar om företag som är aktiva
inom sådana branscher. Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018) lämnade också bort företag inom
mediebranschen av samma orsak.
All aktiedata jag har använt kommer från Yahoo! Finance, medan all marknadsdata
kommer från Kenneth Frenchs webbsida. Till aktiedata hör dagliga data över bland
annat aktiepris och handelsvolym. Till marknadsdata hör bland annat dagliga data över
marknadens riskfria avkastning.
40

Christian Hoven
Den empiriska modellen som används i den här avhandlingen för att analysera effekten
av Trumps tweetar på företagsaktier baserar sig på metoden Ge, Kurov och Wolfe
(2018) använde i sin analys. Jag har undersökt hur Trumps tweetar påverkar
avkastning, handelsvolym och volatilitet. Precis som de gjorde använde jag OLSregressioner med företagsfixa effekter. Jag har även kontrollvariabler för tweetar som
laddats upp efter att Trump blev invald som president, men innan han svors in, och för
tweetar som laddats upp då USA:s börs var öppen. Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018) hade
också en kontrollvariabel för tiden innan Trump svors in som president, men inte en
variabel för tweetar som laddats upp då börsen var öppen. Det som Ge, Kurov och
Wolfe (2018) inte har gjort men jag har gjort i den här avhandlingen är att kontrollera
för företagens storlek och undersöka om företag som agerar inom bilindustrin,
försvarsindustrin eller banksektorn påverkas annorlunda av Trumps tweetar än andra
företag.
Resultaten för analysen av tweetarnas effekt på avkastning tyder på att tweetarna
påverkar avkastningen. Positiva tweetar höjer avkastningen, medan negativa tweetar
sänker avkastningen. Det här är i linje med resultaten Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018)
kom fram till. Det som skiljer sig från deras resultat är att de kom fram till att tweetar
som laddades upp innan Trump blev president har en större effekt på avkastningen,
medan min analys visar att tweetar som laddades upp innan Trump blev president har
en mindre effekt på avkastningen. Detta kan bero på att tweetar som laddats upp efter
Ge, Kurov och Wolfes (2018) sampel påverkar avkastningen i större grad. Jag har
också kommit fram till att tweetar som laddats upp med börsen var öppen har än större
effekt på avkastning än andra tweetar.
Enligt de resultat jag har fått har Trumps tweetar en större effekt på avkastningen för
företag inom bilbranschen, medan avkastningen för företag inom försvarsbranschen
påverkas mindre av Trumps tweetar. Avkastningen för företag inom banksektorn
påverkas likadant som företag inom resten av samplet av Trumps tweetar.
De resultat jag har kommit fram till tyder på att Trumps tweetar kan höja på
handelsvolymen, vilket är i linje med Ge, Kurov och Wolfes (2018) resultat. Dock
kommer jag fram till att tweetar som laddats upp innan Trump blev president har en
mindre effekt, medan Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018) kom fram till att dessa tweetar har
en större effekt. Detta tyder igen på att tweetar som laddats upp efter Ge, Kurov och
41

Christian Hoven
Wolfes (2018) sampel har en större effekt på handelsvolymen. Jag har även kommit
fram till att tweetar som Trump laddade upp då börsen var öppen höjer på
handelsvolymen.
Resultaten i den här avhandlingen tyder på att Trumps tweetar höjer på volatiliteten,
detta gäller främst de tweetar som laddats upp då USA:s börs var öppen. Det resultatet
är inte helt i linje med det Ge, Kurov och Wolfe (2018) kom fram till. De kom fram
till att alla tweetar höjer på volatiliteten. Dock hade de inte en variabel för tweetar som
laddades upp under börsens öppettider. I de modeller utan den variabeln visar
resultaten att Trumps tweetar höjer på volatiliteten.
Sammanfattningsvis kommer jag i denna avhandling fram till att Trumps tweetar har
en effekt på aktiers avkastning, där positiva tweetar höjer på avkastningen medan
negativa tweetar sänker på avkastningen. Denna effekt är större för företag inom
bilindustrin, medan den är mindre för företag inom försvarsindustrin. Tweetar som
laddades upp då USA:s börs var öppen hade också en större påverkan på avkastningen.
Det hittades inte lika tecken starka på att Trumps tweetar påverkar handelsvolym, men
tweetar som laddades upp under USA:s börs öppettider visades höja handelsvolymen.
Resultaten för effekten av Trumps tweetar på volatiliteten är liknande som för
handelsvolym. Tweetar som laddats upp när börsen var öppen höjer på volatiliteten,
medan andra tweetar har en mindre effekt. För alla dessa tre utfallsvariabler gäller att
tweetar Trump laddade upp innan han svors in som president har en mindre effekt.

Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman
of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the
Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln
plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of
Kentucky for their confidence in me!
I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to
get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S.
(Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know
soon!
I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a
major announcement concerning Carrier A.C.
staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers!
Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great
workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our
companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier
Great interview on foxandfriends by SteveDoocy
w/ Carrier employee-who has a message for
#PEOTUS
realDonaldTrump
&
#VPEOTUSmike_pence.
Its not uncommon for a Republican to be probusiness. But President-elect Donald Trump
showed Tuesday night hes pro-worker, too, by
saving 1,000 jobs at the Carrier plant in Indiana.
Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order
to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will
sell many air conditioners!
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Indiana
and meet the hard working and wonderful people of
Carrier A.C.
Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather
viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is
happening all over our country. No more!
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One
for future presidents, but costs are out of control,
more than $4 billion. Cancel order!
Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex
Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is
a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders
of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of
ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of
the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to
price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!

.@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher

Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying
retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the
U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines

Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for
their bad acts against their customers and others will
not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but
will be pursued and, if anything, substantially
increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe
when caught cheating!
Why is the United States Post Office, which is
losing many billions of dollars a year, while
charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their
packages, making Amazon richer and the Post
Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging
MUCH MORE!
Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes
America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota

and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS
and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama, helping
to further grow our economy!
Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new
Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over
300,000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000
people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a
very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts
and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest
more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant,
relocating their heavy-truck production from
Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and
paying $2,000 bonus to U.S. employees!
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to
Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend.
Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision. The
voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for
Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs
are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming
back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will
follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into
our economy with many more companies
announcing. American business is hot again!
I promised that my policies would allow companies
like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back
to the United States. Great to see Apple follow
through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for
American workers and the USA!
During the campaign, I promised to MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing
businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very
proud to see companies like Chrysler moving
operations from Mexico to Michigan where there
are so many great American workers!
Tremendous investment by companies from all over
the world being made in America. There has never
been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan
Chase and many others. Massive Regulation
Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a
powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs,

leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA.
Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on

loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of
retailers out of business!
While we are on the subject, it is reported that the
U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each
package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to
Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports
that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has
ballooned,” and that...
...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which
is used as a “lobbyist” and should so REGISTER. If
the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s
shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This
Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real
costs (and taxes) now!
Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money
losing Post Office makes money with Amazon.
THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be
changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are
closing stores all over the country...not a level
playing field!
I am right about Amazon costing the United States
Post Office massive amounts of money for being
their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs
(plus) and not have them bourne by the American
Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders
don’t have a clue (or do they?)!
Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of
Apple. We will be talking about many things,
including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for
many years, by many countries, on trade.
Today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome
heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest
Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse!
Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the
Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has
been, and is, opposed to the AT&T purchase of
Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a
disgrace in reporting!
Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would
move much of their plant operations in Kansas City
to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were
announced. Hence, they were just using
Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how
unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the
White House, I chided them about tariffs in other
countries, like India, being too high. Companies are
now coming back to America. Harley must know
that they won’t be able to sell back into U.S. without
paying a big tax!
A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another
country-never! Their employees and customers are
already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it
will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered,
they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be
taxed like never before!
Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America,
with the people that got you your success. I’ve done
so much for you, and then this. Other companies are
coming back where they belong! We won’t forget,

and neither will your customers or your now very
HAPPY competitors!
Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its
operation out of the U.S., my Administration is
working with other Motor Cycle companies who
want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not
happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017.
The U.S. is where the Action is!
Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have
raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely
taking advantage of the poor & others unable to
defend themselves, while at the same time giving
bargain basement prices to other countries in
Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!
Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our
drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price
hikes, so American patients don’t pay more. We
applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other
companies do the same. Great news for the
American people!
Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices
on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are
making a big push to actually reduce the prices,
maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.

I told you so! The European Union just slapped a
Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great
companies, Google. They truly have taken
advantage of the U.S., but not for long!
Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the
company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great!
Most other companies are coming in our direction,
including Harley competitors. A really bad move!
U.S. will soon have a level playing field, or better.
Target CEO raves about the Economy. “This is the
best consumer environment I’ve seen in my career.”
A big statement from a top executive. But virtually
everybody is saying this, & when our Trade Deals
are made, & cost cutting done, you haven’t seen
anything yet! @DRUDGE_REPORT
Google search results for “Trump News” shows
only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In
other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others,
so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN
is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair
Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of....
....results on “Trump News” are from National LeftWing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are
suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding
information and news that is good. They are
controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very
serious situation-will be addressed!
Apple prices may increase because of the massive
Tariffs we may be imposing on China - but there is
an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax,
and indeed a tax incentive. Make your products in

the United States instead of China. Start building
new plants now. Exciting! #MAGA
“Ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a Chinesemade small vehicle in the U.S. because of the
prospect of higher U.S. Tariffs.” CNBC. This is just
the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE
U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!
Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a
system to “purge” themselves of Fake News. Does
that mean CNN will finally be put out of business?
Twitter has removed many people from my account
and, more importantly, they have seemingly done
something that makes it much harder to join - they
have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to
all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship, now it is
a Blimp! Total Bias?

Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates
Antitrust Laws. “These guys are acting much worse,

Very disappointed with General Motors and their
CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio,
Michigan and Maryland. Nothing being closed in
Mexico & China. The U.S. saved General Motors,
and this is the THANKS we get! We are now
looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including....
....for electric cars. General Motors made a big
China bet years ago when they built plants there
(and in Mexico) - don’t think that bet is going to pay
off. I am here to protect America’s Workers!
.....and G.M. would not be closing their plants in
Ohio, Michigan & Maryland. Get smart Congress.
Also, the countries that send us cars have taken
advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President
has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M.
event, it is being studied now!
Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand
new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that
will create 600 good-paying U.S. JOBS. Steel JOBS
are coming back to America, just like I predicted.
Congratulations to Steel Dynamics!
General Motors is very counter to what other auto,
and other, companies are doing. Big Steel is
opening and renovating plants all over the country.
Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including
BMW, which just announced a major new plant.
The U.S.A. is booming!
Thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand
operations in the U.S. and thereby creating
thousands of jobs! Connected retweet: "Apple Red

Great news from @Ford! They are investing nearly
$1 BILLION in Flat Rock, Michigan for auto
production on top of a $1 BILLION investment last
month in a facility outside of Chicago. Companies
are pouring back into the United States - they want
to be where the action is!
Just met with @SundarPichai, President of
@Google, who is obviously doing quite well. He
stated strongly that he is totally committed to the
U.S. Military, not the Chinese Military....
....Also discussed political fairness and various
things that @Google can do for our Country.
Meeting ended very well!
What do I know about branding, maybe nothing
(but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing,
I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some
additional great features, & REBRAND the plane
with a new name. No product has suffered like this
one. But again, what the hell do I know?
“Harley Davidson has struggled with Tariffs with
the EU, currently paying 31%. They’ve had to move
production overseas to try and offset some of that
Tariff that they’ve been hit with which will rise to
66% in June of 2021.” @MariaBartiromo So unfair
to U.S. We will Reciprocate!
Congrats to @U_S_Steel for investing $1+
BILLION in America's most INNOVATIVE steel
mill. 232 Tariffs make Pennsylvania and USA more
prosperous/secure by bringing Steel and Aluminum
industries BACK. Tariffs are working. Pittsburgh is
again The Steel City. USA Economy is
BOOMING!
How can it be possible that James Woods (and
many others), a strong but responsible Conservative
Voice, is banned from Twitter? Social Media &
Fake News Media, together with their partner, the
Democrat Party, have no idea the problems they are
causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!
GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO! Just spoke to Mary
Barra, CEO of General Motors, who informed me
that, subject to a UAW agreement etc., GM will be
selling their beautiful Lordstown Plant to
Workhorse, where they plan to build Electric
Trucks. GM will also be spending $700,000,000 in
Ohio...

GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO! Just spoke to Mary

that, subject to a UAW agreement etc., GM will be
selling their beautiful Lordstown Plant to
Workhorse, where they plan to build Electric
Trucks. GM will also be spending $700,000,000 in
Ohio...
....in 3 separate locations, creating another 450 jobs.
I have been working nicely with GM to get this
done. Thank you to Mary B, your GREAT
Governor, and Senator Rob Portman. With all the
car companies coming back, and much more, THE
USA IS BOOMING!
Great to welcome Chairman Shin from Lotte Group
to the WH. They just invested $3.1 BILLION into
Louisiana-biggest investment in U.S. EVER from a
South Korean company, & thousands more jobs for
Americans. Great partners like ROK know the U.S.
economy is running stronger than ever!
With incredible grit, skill, and pride, the 7,000
workers here at Sempra Energy are helping lead the
American Energy Revolution. They are not only
making our nation WEALTHIER but they are
making America SAFER by building a future of
American Energy INDEPENDENCE!
Just spoke to Marillyn Hewson, CEO of
@LockheedMartin, about continuing operations for
the @Sikorsky in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. She
will be taking it under advisement and will be
making a decision soon....
....While Pennsylvania is BOOMING, I don’t want
there to be even a little glitch in Coatesville – every
job counts. I want Lockhead to BOOM along with
it!
I was just informed by Marillyn Hewson, CEO of
Lockheed Martin, of her decision to keep the
Sikorsky Helicopter Plant in Coatesville,
Pennsylvania, open and humming! We are very
proud of Pennsylvania and the people who work
there....
....Thank you to Lockheed Martin, one of the USA’s
truly great companies!
Apple will not be given Tariff waiver, or relief, for
Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them
in the USA, no Tariffs!
.@sundarpichai of Google was in the Oval Office
working very hard to explain how much he liked
me, what a great job the Administration is doing,
that Google was not involved with China’s military,
that they didn’t help Crooked Hillary over me in the
2016 Election, & that they...
... are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020
Election despite all that has been said to the
contrary. It all sounded good until I watched Kevin
Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things
about what they did in 2016 and that they want to
“Make sure that Trump losses...
...in 2020.” Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on
the American public. @peterschweizer stated with

Wow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from
2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton
in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton
supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should
be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought!
@JudicialWatch
The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the
Founders of Ford Motor Company and General
Motors, are “rolling over” at the weakness of
current car company executives willing to spend
more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and
cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!

Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw
his modern-day descendants wanting to build a
much more expensive car, that is far less safe and
doesn’t work as well, because execs don’t want to
fight California regulators. Car companies should
know....
General Motors, which was once the Giant of
Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto
manufacturers there. They moved major plants to
China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was
done despite the saving help given them by the
USA. Now they should start moving back to
America again?
Here we go again with General Motors and the
United Auto Workers. Get together and make a
deal!
Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook

Navistar will be building a new 250 MILLION
DOLLAR truck factory in San Antonio with 600
new jobs. Congratulations San Antonio and Texas!
America makes the GREATEST trucks in the
world!
Great news! @Apple announced that it is building

American jobs in Austin and for suppliers across the
Country. Congratulations to the Apple team and
their workers!

This is far greater than expectations. USA ROCKS!
Walmart announces great numbers. No impact from

Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant
in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to
