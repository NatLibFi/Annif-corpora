Printing of pharmaceuticals is actively researched as a tailored and flexible fabricating
method, towards personalized medicine. Inkjet printing is considered as a precise dosing
method and in this work, theophylline is printed on eight different materials (aluminum, steel,
glass, enamel, plexi, epoxy, rubber and paper) in different doses between 0.59 and 474.4
µg/cm2 with Dimatix DMP 2830 material printer with piezoelectric, 10 pL droplet actuation.
Theophylline was dissolved in a, for this printing application, optimized ink consisting of
glycerol, ethanol and water in ratio 10:45:45 in concentrations between 0.06 and 11.84
mg/mL. Three different methods for adjusting the printed theophylline concentration per
area were evaluated and the samples were analyzed visually and with three spectrometric
methods. While near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy showed unsatisfactory results
for detecting small amounts of printed theophylline on the different surfaces, Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) detected printed doses as low as 2.34 µg/cm2.
Escalating printed doses of theophylline were detected both visually and by FTIR on
respective surfaces. Inkjet-printed active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) could potentially
be used as standards for cleaning validation purposes and for calibration of already
established analytical instruments, as well as in the development of new promising methods
for detection of small amounts of APIs on surfaces.

INTRODUCTION
Background

All humans are not biologically the same and a need for personalized medicine and a mindset
of “one dose does not necessarily fit all” have emerged during the last decades. This mindset
especially applies for some specialized medicine (such as breast cancer treatment), where
sex, age, race, weight and biology of the patient, play an important role in uptake of the
medication and the bioactivity in body. Printing of pharmaceuticals has been proven to be an
additive manufacturing method in aspect to customization and flexible dosing opportunities.
Additive manufacturing has already been used in e.g. the automobile industry to 3D-print
spare parts according to the costumer’s specific need, rather than being limited to traditional
fabrication. During the last decade, both 2D and 3D printing technologies have been proven
promising for several medical applications. Benefits include low production cost, negligible
variability (unit-to-unit), and of course high flexibility for customization, both for
therapeutical and biomedical applications such as organs and artificial tissues. In 2015, the
first printed drug, SPRITAM® (levetiracetam) by Aprecia Pharmaceuticals Company, entered
the market. The technology uses a 2D inkjet printing technique to build a 3D structure layer
by layer [1]. [2]
The most research that have been done on printing of APIs, are products intended to be
consumed either by injection, inhalation or orally. The printing substrates (substrate is the
word generally used to describe the material, onto which an ink is printed), are usually
porous; powders or liquid- or orally dispersible films. Another, less studied point of view is
how printing of pharmaceuticals can be utilized in other areas in the pharmaceutical industry.
The focus of this thesis was to explore printing of small amounts (µg) APIs of different
materials used in dug production facilities and to investigate the lowest detectable amount
of printed API on different surfaces. Printing could potentially be used for prototyping of drug
residuals in production vessels and pipelines, to exhibit precise drug amounts as standards
for cleaning validation purposes. The printing substrates and associated challenges (e.g.
coatings for better ink absorption, bioavailability and toxicity) in this work, differ essentially
from previously done studies. Regardless of application, the underlying barriers for printing
of pharmaceuticals can still be considered remaining. These can be categorized as following:
1) formulation of ink 2) ink delivery equipment 3) drop formation 4) impact, phase change
and stability 5) quality of printed result and characterization. [3]

Project background

Orion Corporation (Orion Oyj) is a globally operating, Finnish pharmaceutical company
established in 1917, with a net sale of EUR 1,078 million (2020) and has an extensive portfolio
with hundreds of products, both human and veterinary pharmaceuticals. The products
include healthcare prescription drugs and other products for illness treatment and
prevention. Orion’s product selection can be divided into four categories: trademarked drugs
developed by Orion, generic drugs, licensed drugs patented by other pharmaceutical
companies, self-care products such as basic ointments, vitamins and non-prescription
medicines. These include tablets, gels, ointments, injections, inhalation products, API
production (Fermion Oy) with various different production lines. [4]
Orion works under pharmaceutical, good manufacturing practice (GMP) and is regulated by
authorities (both national and international) to guarantee drug quality, purity, safety and
potency for consumers. These include precise standard operating procedures, quality
management systems and cleaning validations [5]. Cleaning validation is extremely important
and inevitable for drug production to exclude cross-contamination (detergent, microbial, or
API). Visual inspection, rinse sampling and surface sampling are the three prominent
standard procedures to assure cleanness in the pharmaceutical industry. Surface sampling is
preferably made with swabbing or wiping and measured with off-line high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), which can be both costly and time consuming with respect to
sample preparation and analysis time [6]. To avoid adding production delays and still assure
GMP cleanness standard, in-, on-, or at-line methods with direct or non-contact sampling
could be preferred for cleaning validation. Spectrometric analytical methods are known for
being rapid, accurate and have low/no sampling cost and handheld devices could be a new
method of operation. The limiting factors are the detection limit and calibration of the
instrument for pharmaceutical validation. [6]
With an accurate dosing method, it would be possible to model standards for drug residue
limits and maximum allowable carryovers (MAC). Printed API series could be used for
calibration of both currently used analytical instruments and new promising methods for
detection of small amounts of APIs on surfaces. Inkjet is a non-contact printing method with
controlled deposition of small droplets (pL) onto a substrate, according to a preset digital
design pattern. The focus of this thesis work was an investigation in inkjet printing of small
amounts of API on different substrates and to analyze the prints with spectrometric methods
to scope the rough detection limits in different methods and wavelengths.

Inkjet printing
Inkjet printing in a historical perspective

The first inkjet printer was a medical strip chart recorder produced by Siemens in 1950.
During 1970-1980, inkjet printing was commercially developed for labelling and marking
products with dates, bulk numbers, and bar codes. The printers used continuous inkjet (CIJ)
technology, but in the mid 1980´s, a technology with much higher printing resolution was
developed. The new method used drop-on-demand (DoD) technology and was a much more
accurate and cost-effective way of printing. [7] [8]
From there on, printing as technology has blossomed and at the beginning of 2000, inkjet
printing was one of the world’s most actively patented technologies with close to four
thousand patents [7]. Inkjet printing has evolved from a marking and labelling technique to
a desktop, consumer and home-office printing technique and today, wide range of industries
use inkjet printing. Some examples are 3D rapid prototyping, conductive patterns of costly
materials, automotive coatings, ceramics and plastic part decorations [7].
Inkjet printing is already established in pharmaceutical industry for packaging and
distribution activities such as serialization and traceability. While pharmaceutical materials
are not printed in these applications, the technology is familiar for most pharmaceutical
companies, which enables a rapid uptake in possible manufacturing context with in-house
expertise. The pharmaceutical field has countless of possibilities for inkjet printing, many of
which are already under research. Inkjet printing has potential in fast fabrication of a
discovered drug, in advanced drug delivery applications and for manufacturing of
personalized medicine. Compared to other prototyping methods, inkjet is considered user
friendly with relatively straightforward computer graphical design possibilities. This allows
for rapid prototyping of e.g. biomaterials for biological applications. [3] [7]

2.1.2

Inkjet printing technologies

Today, there is a wide range of different methods of printing, both conventional and digital.
Conventional printing uses a designed printing plate to physically print the pattern and the
methods are therefore called impact printing. How the pattern is transferred is what mainly
4

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

differentiates the conventional methods from each other. Digital printing methods, in
contrast, use digital designs prepared by a software to produce patterns or 3D objects. The
available technologies can be divided into inkjet-, laser- and extrusion-based printing
technologies [9] [10]. Some also consider electrospray technology as a category of its own
[8].
This thesis focuses on inkjet printing which is mainly divided into two main methods and
several sub-methods. The main methods are CIJ and DoD printing (see Figure 1). CIJ is usually
more robust and is used industrially for date-mark and code printing, while DoD printers
dominate the home printer market [3]. The CIJ printing method uses a continuous stream of
liquid ink that naturally breaks down into a stream of smaller droplets from which those to
be printed are selected by an induced electrical field and printed onto the substrate [11]. The
excess ink droplets can be collected and recirculated. DoD, in turn, makes individual droplets
on an impulse [12]. The DoD methods can be divided into different categories according to
how the impulse is initiated, by a thermal, piezoelectric, electrostatic or electrohydrodynamic element (see Figure 1) [8] [9]. The focus of the thesis is on piezoelectric inkjet
(PIJ) printing technology, but all inkjet technologies are shortly described.

Figure 1. Overview of Continuous (CIJ) and Drop on Demand (DoD) inkjet printing technologies: Thermal (TIJ),
Piezoelectric (PIJ), Electrostatic (ES) and Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printing. The focus of this work is
on PIJ actuation. (Modified from H. Wikström [9])

Thermal inkjet (TIJ) actuation utilizes the heat expansion and evaporation of the printing fluid
to form a droplet. This happens by rapid heating of a small part of a chamber containing the
ink, which causes the ink above the heater to vaporize and push a droplet of ink through the
nozzle. While the advantages of thermal inkjet printing are compact and low-cost devices, it
5

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

is strongly limited by the ink fluids. The ink needs to both withstand high local temperatures
(200-400 °C) and have the right vaporization properties. [10] [13]
TIJ was a popular technology in consumer desktop printers, but piezoelectric DoD droplet
generation has fewer design constrains and has become the dominating technique in home
and office printers. It is also the main technique used in printheads for industrial applications
such as digital fabrication.
PIJ actuation utilizes the distortion of a piezoelectric material when under an electrical field.
By creating an electric impulse, the piezoelectric wall of the ink chamber changes shape or
size, which creates a pressure pulse in the fluid, forcing an ink droplet from the nozzle orifice.
An often-used material for piezoelectric actuation is lead zirconate titanate, which is a
ceramic material with a strong piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect is described as
the material’s ability to cause an electric field as a response of mechanical strain, or more
importantly, change shape under presence of an electric field. The piezoelectric effect is
depending on the poling effect of dipoles in a material that expands or contracts according
to in which direction the electric field is applied. Several actuation mechanism techniques
have been developed utilizing these effects. The push-mode actuator directly uses the
expansion-contraction effect to physically make the thin sheet of a piezoelectric material
push a membrane which modifies the volume of the ink container and pushes ink through
the nozzle [14]. Waveform is a term used for describing how a fluid is jetted (voltage ramp)
and the firing voltage and amplitude is usually tuned according to the rheology of the ink
[15]. While piezoelectric actuation normally is more expensive than thermal actuation,
piezoelectric actuation can print a wide range of different fluids, which gives a wider freedom
for ink formulation development. [7] [8]
Electrostatic (ES) inkjet actuation works similarly to the piezoelectric technique: a pressure
plate in the ink chamber moves by a voltage pulse formed between an electrode and the
plate [16]. This will reduce the space in the chamber and physically eject a droplet.
Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet actuation works by an induced electric field between the
substrate and the nozzle, which forms a high voltage and a conductive ink droplet is ejected.
While the technique implementation is high-cost and only niched for some specific inks,
electrohydrodynamic printing is able to print extremely small droplets (0.2-2 µL) of high
viscous inks and the drop size is adjustable during printing since it is a function of the induced
electric field. [17] [18]

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

The four main types of inkjet inks are water-based, solvent-based, phase-changing (hot
melts) and UV-curable ink. Hybrid ink types of these also exist. Other inks, such as oil-based
and liquid toner inks, are available but not as common. If the ink is intended to be ejected by
an electrical field (CIJ, EHD), the ink must obviously contain a charge control agent for the
printing technique to work. The conductivity of the ink is crucial, and agents need to be
soluble in the ink. Normally, electrolytes or ionic surfactants are used as charge agents. This
thesis, however, focuses on solvent-water based inks. [7]
Inkjet-printed drop diameters are typically 10-100 µm, with a drop volume of 0.5-500 pL. The
most used printing technologies, TIJ and PIJ, typically have nozzle orifice diameters of 10-50
μm, and drop volumes of 1-70 pL [3] [8] [12]. Most DoD printheads have several printing
nozzles (up to several hundred nozzles), arranged in a linear row or in a two-dimensional
matrix. This streamlines and speeds up the printing process. The printhead (or heads) is
normally fixed in a movable framework over the substrate, which allows printing larger areas
than the dimension of the printhead. Commonly, the printhead moves along one axis and
the substrate in perpendicular direction, step by step. By using a moving printhead, the
printing resolution can be increased by overprinting (see Chapter 2.1.4). The printhead (or
heads) unit is usually removable and replaceable in a printer and normally has some finetune alignment options (mechanical or electronic) for flexible printing options. [7]

2.1.3

Ink printing process, drop behavior and evaporation on the substrate

A PIJ drop actuation begins with an application of a voltage change (a positive pressure pulse)
which makes the piezoelectric material ink chamber change shape or size, which results in
extrusion of ink from the nozzle. The jet of ink then necks down and breaks off from the
nozzle. Typically, after the break-off, the jet includes a bigger head containing most of the ink
and a filament extending behind the head. The surface tension of the ink forces the jet into
pulling all the liquid into a fully spherical droplet, as it moves downwards towards the
substrate (see Figure 2) [19] [20]. The piezoelectric meniscus retracts, and the ink chamber
refills by either capillary (surface driven) forces, Bernoulli underpressure effect or due to
damping oscillations caused by releasing of the droplet. Time for a whole cycle is between 5250 µs and droplet volumes are set according to ink cartridge. A PIJ printer is normally
capable of printing 10 000-30 000 droplets per second. [7] [8]

Master’s Thesis

Figure 2. A series of photos showing the successive stages of an inkjet droplet formation. [21]

Satellite droplets are additional droplets that may be produced during inkjet printing. These
additional droplets are smaller than the intended droplet and follow it like a tail of pearls.
Satellite droplets are a result of a collapse of surface tension and filament forming one or
several droplets instead of condensing into one united droplet. This is a characteristic trait
for when conditions for ink properties and print actuation (waveform) are not fully met and
can cause a number of problems, such as printing quality defects and equipment malfunction
due to contamination. Since the satellite droplets are smaller than the main droplet, they are
not influenced by gravitational forces in the same way which means that the satellite droplet
may not necessarily land on the intended spot on the substrate or end up in an undesired
location in the printer construction. In practical printing applications, the presence of satellite
droplets can be tolerated to some extent, especially if the satellite droplet unites with the
original droplet on the substrate. [3] [7] [8]
Satellite droplets can be reduced or eliminated with nozzle design, the waveform settings for
the transducer drive and/or by tuning the amplitude of the initial droplet impulse [8] [22].
These are often ink-specific settings according to ink’s specific properties and its behavior
when fired from the nozzle. Some PIJ printers also eject subtle vibrations and by that help
the droplet to break off cleanly [23].
In a printing process, a droplet is fired from the nozzle and flies towards the substrate with a
velocity depending on the firing voltage and gravitational forces according to the mass of the
droplet (see Figure 3). On its way towards the substrate, the droplet is possibly losing some
mass due to solvent evaporation, which might affect the speed of the droplet [24]. When the
droplet falls as a sphere, the initial energy state can be divided into two components: kinetic
energy and surface energy [25]. When a droplet with a specific volume and certain speed hits
the surface, it changes shape, starts spreading and wets the surface according to the
8

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

properties of the ink and the substrate (see Chapter 2.2.3) [26]. On a non-absorbing
substrate, the kinetic energy is transferred into excess surface energy and a small amount of
heat during oscillatory motion of the fluid when retracting (viscous dissipation) until an
equilibrium is attained [8].

Figure 3. A schematic overview of the inkjet printing process. In case of an absorbing substrate, substrate
permeation will take place. (Recreated from Hutchings et al. [8])

During solvent evaporation, the contact line pinning occurs in two stages: 1) the dropletsubstrate contact area remains the same while the contact angle is reduced 2) contact line
reacts and the contact area decreases [27]. During solvent evaporation, the fluid mass loss is
proportional to the droplets spreading on the surface and liquid-vapor interface. A general
rule of thumb is that a droplet with smaller initial contact angle has a higher evaporation
rate. In case of an absorbing substrate, spreading, permeation and evaporation occur
parallelly, partly in and partly on the substrate [28]. Drying is also limited to the thermal
properties of the substrate. One way of speeding up the drying process is by heating the
substrate during printing, but this might also affect the viscosity of the ink and, furthermore,
it’s spreading on the substrate. [7] [8]
In most cases, the ink contains solid particles or dissolved substances and these will discharge
from the solution due to the solubility limit and as the solvent carrier evaporates, the contact
line decreases and particles are left and form a spot on the surface [29]. A so-called coffee
9

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

staining effect can occur where the solid material only forms a ring around the original
contact line and the center is free of deposit when the solvent has evaporated. This deceases
the print quality. [30]

2.1.4

Print resolution

Printing resolution is a term for describing the closest spacing of individually printed spots of
ink, conventionally described as dots per inch (dpi). Horizontal and perpendicular dpi may
differ from each other based on print head direction. Dpi correlates to the space between
printed droplets, drop spacing. The resolution depends on printed droplet’s size, nozzle
spacing, printhead, substrate and the movement of these. [8]
Grey scale printing is an excellent example of innovative printing where dpi plays an essential
role in the printing technique [8]. Normally, one nozzle prints one size droplet and by
adjusting the closeness of printed droplets or by printing several overlapping layers, one
single ink can behave as several different.
Since most manufactured printheads have numerous nozzles, often in several rows, the internozzle row gap might be larger than the required printing resolution, perpendicular to the
printing direction. This challenge can be overcome by:
•

Overprinting the same area. By moving the printhead several times over the same
area, it is possible to fill in the empty gap and attain a higher dpi.

•

Adjusting the angle of the printhead, printhead motion and droplet ejection timing,
droplets can be printed closer together in perpendicular direction to print direction.

•

Using several printheads for the same printing area. The heads can be positioned so
that they can print interleave spots and achieve a higher printing resolution. [8]

Dpi is limited by the ink’s wettability on the substrate. Depending on the size of the printed
ink droplets and the drop spacing, the ink droplets´ absorption or spreading on the substrate
might result in overlapping or merging. The physical and chemical interaction between the
ink and the substrate are essential for printing and the properties are tunable with pre- or
post-treatment such as substrate coating, printing conditions and drying or/and curing
conditions. [8]

Inkjet printing of Pharmaceuticals

Most research of inkjet printing of pharmaceuticals has been done on DoD technology rather
than CIJ. The small volume of liquid required for DoD printing is an advantage. On the other
hand, recirculation of the CIJ-ink might be a risk for contamination. DoD printheads usually
have multiple nozzles (up to 1000), but some special printheads only have a single nozzle. [3]
A wide range of different materials, including nanomaterials, cells and colloids have
previously, successfully been inkjet-printed and inks containing particles (e.g. pigmented
inks), have already been industrially printed for decades. Firstly, solid pharmaceuticals are
limited by concentration in the ink, particle size and morphology in combination with the
printhead. Secondly, the reliability and print consistency in a pharmaceutical context requires
a careful long-term testing of the system alongside quality control. Thirdly (and maybe most
importantly) there is a need of application and cost effectiveness for implementing industrial
printing of pharmaceuticals. There is currently a shift in the trends for the pharmaceutical
sector, where there is a demand on a broader range of flexible, specialized products in lower
volumes for specific patient populations (and towards personalized medicines) that will not
be fulfilled with traditional large-scale batch production. The new emerge of therapy areas
as well as new technologies has potential for dramatic changes in pharmaceutical and
medical manufacturing as well as in the supply chain. [3] [31]
In the beginning of 21st century, additive manufacturing (also referred to as 3D-printing) of
pharmaceuticals with inkjet printing has focused on different powder-bed technologies,
where a binder (ink) is printed on a powder layer-by-layer to build a macroscopic solid
structure. The API can be placed in either the powder or the binder and final solid structure
is then usually achieved by thermal sintering, which also limits the use of delicate functional
pharmaceutical molecules. [32] [33] [34]
A huge historical breakthrough was in 2015, when Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for SPRITAM® (levetiracetam), the first 3D printed
pharmaceutical product on the market (2016). The producer, Aprecia Pharmaceuticals
Company, uses a ZipDose® technology to produce a porous orodispersible, anticonvulsant
tablet for epilepsy. The ZipDose® technology is principally inkjet-printed layers of an ink
binder and a powder, forming a mold for the tablet. The mold is then filled with an APIcontaining powder (up to 1 000 mg of API per tablet) and sealed with inkjet-printed layers of
ink binder and powder. [1]

In contrast to standard inkjet printing and biological printing research where systems are
usually modelled with a standard of glucose oxidase and Newtonian liquid such as waterglycerol mixtures prior to more complex experiments, there is no standard molecule to
model APIs in inkjet printing of pharmaceuticals. However, a general trend of printing small
molecules is yet noticeable (see
Table 1). The chemistry of APIs differs widely and is crucial for both ink formulation and
ancillary printing equipment. According to Strickley, APIs from the same family behave
similarly in carrier fluids and it was suggested by Daly et al. that the concept systems for
printing pharmaceutical should focus on developing model systems so that it would be easier
to apply an already working system to another, similar product. [3] [35]
Most pharmaceutical printing have been done with research scale printheads such as
MicroDrop and Microfab single nozzle, PIJ glass capillary devices, Dimatix Material Printers,
or modified consumer desktop printers. These have been studied due to their precise dosing
and applicability for personalized medicine. Printed pharmaceuticals are expected to
revolutionize drug preparation and it is envisioned that printers could be used in hospitals or
pharmacies for late-stage customization. [3]
In Table 1, previously inkjet-printed APIs are summarized. Most APIs have been printed on
thin films, sheets forms or tablets. Usually porous substrates such as hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HPMC) have been used, but some cases where non-porous films and glass
plates have been used are also noted. The inks were formulated according to API, printer and
application.

Characterization of inkjet-printed pharmaceuticals is essential for product and application
development. Characterization techniques and examples on practical implementations for
inkjet-printed samples are listed in Table 2. Since inkjet printing is considered to be a precise
dosing technique with an accuracy on microscale, it has potential to work as a method for
preparing calibration standards for both already existing and new characterization
technologies.

Ink and substrate properties
Importance of ink formulation

Printable inks are under constant development and to this day, there is no universal ink that
would fit every application. Print quality, image robustness, compatibility, application
performance, jetting characteristics, adhesion, drying/curing process, pre- and postprocessing, reliability, shelf life, manufacturing complexity, regulatory (i.e. FDA) are some
main features that need to be taken into consideration when developing an ink for printing.
Due to the scope of this thesis, the focus is concentrated on the desired physicochemical
properties of printable API-containing inks.
An ink can contain solids either as dissolved in the ink solution or as colloidal particles (widely
used to print metals and ceramics). In case of dissolving solids (APIs) into an ink, the loading
is limited by the solubility of the solids in the ink. The ink composition and solvents can be
tuned according to desired solubility, but this will also most likely affect other properties of
the ink. Volume fraction of solids that can be used in an ink fluid is normally relatively low
and heavily loaded colloidal fluids for printing are still under development. Not only does a
colloidal ink suspension need to have the right rheological properties for printing, the size of
the particles needs to be controlled to avoid nozzles from clogging. [8]
Regarding inkjet printing, surface tension and viscosity are the two most important
properties for a printable ink. Liquid, printed from a circular nozzle, automatically takes a
cylindrical, column shape. However, according to the law of Rayleigh-Plateau instability,
surface tension causes the liquid to pinch off into smaller droplets to achieve energy
minimum. Without interacting electrostatic or aerodynamic forces, the jetted liquid takes
the shape with the lowest total energy, a sphere (see chapter 2.1.3) [8]. Liquid printed on a
solid substrate interacts with the surrounding air and the substrate. The droplet’s spreading
on the surface is called wetting and it is a result of surface tension, cohesive forces within the
liquid and the adhesive forces between the liquid and surface (solid) (see Chapter 2.2.3).
Viscosity, especially the dynamic viscosity, affects the flow behavior of the ink. Viscosity is a
result of the interactive forces between the liquid’s molecules when sections of the liquid are
moving relative to one another. Viscosity is also related to the density of the liquid. Organic
solvents (such as water and ethanol) are usually Newtonian and show a linear behavior under
shear, but most practical inkjet inks are somewhat viscoelastic and show a time-dependent

15

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

elastic response to shear. The viscosity of most liquids is temperature-dependent and
decreases with increased temperature. This is utilized in e.g. TIJ printing and temperature is
often an adjustable feature for PIJ actuation. Thus, by adjusting the jetting temperature, the
desired viscosity for printing ink might be achieved. [8]
Both surface tension and viscosity of the ink need to be appropriate to accomplish a good
print quality. With too low surface tension and viscosity, there is a risk that the ink will run
out of the nozzle by itself and with a too high surface tension and viscosity, the actuation
force will not be strong enough to push the ink from the nozzle orifice. Both surface tension
and viscosity can be controlled by addition of surfactants, humectants (normally some kind
of glycol) and by selecting a proper solvent composition. Magadassi recommends an ink with
viscosity 1-5 cP or 10-14 cP, density 0.9-1.1 g/ml and surface tension 20-50 mN/m for PIJ
printing. The ranges can vary widely according to printer. Nozzle design, actuation technique,
printing temperature and ink formulation are all factors that set the requirement for the ink’s
surface tension and viscosity. [7] [8]

2.2.2

Characteristic dimensionless numbers for ink formation

When a droplet is formed, surface tension, viscosity and inertia are the key properties for
how the liquid behaves. Dimensionless numbers have been developed to theoretically
describe a liquid’s behavior. The three most relevant parameters for droplet jetting are
presented in this chapter. The Reynolds (Re) number describes the relation between viscous
and inertial forces of a moving fluid, while the Weber (We) number represents the influence
of kinetic energy in relation to surface energy. By combining these two into the Ohnesorge
(Oh) number, the influence of velocity can be eliminated. [8] [71]

16

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

properties of the liquid and the size of the jet or droplet [20]. With an Oh number close to 1,
the viscous forces will prevent a droplet from separating from the liquid in the nozzle but if
the Oh number is too low and close to 0.1, the liquid will form satellite drops (see Chapter
2.1.3). In DoD printing, all the parameters, including velocity, still must be optimized to
achieve a suitable combination of physical properties for printing. Fromm opined that an ink
with Oh number lower than 0.5 should be printable with DoD printing, this while the optimal
parameters for printing are suggested to be to 0.1<Oh<1 according to e.g. Reis and Derby
among others and 0.07<Oh<0.25 according to Jang et al. [12] [20] [72] [73]. Magadassi
suggests an ink with Re number 50-500 and We number 20-300 for inkjet printing [7].

Inkjet printing usually has droplet volumes up to 200 pL and inertial effects are more
significant than the effect of surface energy and viscosity. This means that the Re and We
numbers can be high while Oh number is low and that the exchange between surface and
kinetic energy is the most relevant factor in printing. The Re, We and Oh number are
developed for Newtonian fluids and while they are indicative for if a printing will succeed,
the rheology of printing inks (e.g. shear-thinning or viscoelastic behavior), printhead design
and surrounding factors might differ and, therefore, the best way of assuring good
printability is through experimental tests. [8]

2.2.3

Correlation between ink and substrate

While drop-substrate interactions have been studied extensively by Worthington (1876),
Armster et al. (2002) and Yarin (2006) among others, a complete explanation of the complex
flow mechanisms has not yet been done [8]. The mechanisms include the droplet’s kinetic
energy that initiates spreading on the surface until this energy is converted to surface energy
or lost through viscous dissipation. Factors such as initial mass and velocity of the droplet,
surface tension and viscosity of the fluid and properties of the substrate are essential for
explaining the drop-substrate behavior. Some theories have been presented, trying to
explain the liquid-solid interactive behavior (wettability) and some dimensionless numbers
have been established to describe a liquid’s viscous, inertial and surface forces. Three of
these are presented in Chapter 2.2.2.

Figure 4. A liquid drop in equilibrium on a surface with contact angle (ϴγ) depending on three surface
energies: liquid-vapor (γLV), solid-vapor (γSV) and liquid-solid (γLS)

A drop rests in equilibrium on a surface with an equilibrium contact angle, ϴγ (also referred
to as Young contact angle), which is dependent on three prominent surface energies: surface
energy component (γLV) which is the interfacial surface tension between the liquid and the
vapor, surface energy component (γSV) which is the interfacial surface tension between the
solid and the vapor, surface energy component γLS (γLS) which is the interfacial surface tension
between the liquid and the solid (see Figure 4). The surface free energy (SFE) for a solid is

given by Young equation (4) [74].

𝜸𝑺𝑽 = 𝜸𝑳𝑺 + 𝜸𝑳𝑽 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜭𝜸

Equation 4.

The equation assumes that the surface is homogeneous and has a smooth topography. The
contact angle (ϴγ) and liquid-vapor surface tension (γLV) are easily determined, but the solidliquid surface tension (γLS) cannot be measured directly without assumptions. Since the
measuring liquid and interfacial interactions with the substrate play an essential role in the
determination of γLS, Fowkes suggested that the SFE should be calculated as a sum of
dispersive, polar, hydrogen, induction components and additionally a component including
remaining interactions [75]. Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble simplified the idea and
supposed that the components could be considered either dispersive (γd) or polar (γp) and
combined this theory with Young equation into so called OWRK equation (5) [76].

A further, more resent approach is the Van Oss-Chaudhury-Good (vOCG) method where the
polar components are divided into acid and base components and the equation is written as

Since the equation includes three unknown components, 𝛾𝑆𝑉
, 𝛾𝑆𝑉
, 𝛾𝑆𝑉
, at least three

measuring liquids are needed, one dispersive and two polar, to calculate the SFE for a surface.
The Young contact angle is a simplification and considers the measuring surface as ideal and
disregards both the apparent and the actual contact angle which consider surface roughness
[7]. Real surfaces often show some extent of roughness or/and chemical heterogeneity and
can be measured to some degree with various methods. Roughness is an important factor
for understanding wettability of a surface, but it is considered to extend the scope of this
thesis and is therefore not covered in this work.

2.2.4

Typical limitations and challenges for printing

When designing a printing sequence, the main print-influencing factors that need to be taken
into consideration are following:
•

Ink suitability for the print function

•

Ink-printer material compatibility (both short and long term)

•

Printability of ink in the specific printhead

•

Reliability of ink for print consistency

•

Ink-substrate adhesion behavior

•

Substrate consistency (substrate might need pretreatment)

•

Drying and/or curing process (can also be improved with post-treatment)

•

Printing environment (temperature, humidity, contaminants, dust…) [8]

Nozzle clogging is a feature that, most probably, ruins the print result to some extent. Nozzles
can clog due to ink solvent evaporation at the tip of the nozzle, or due to too large particles
in the ink. Less volatile solvents with lower evaporation rate are usually preferred in inks.
Another option is to add a co-solvent to delay loss of e.g. water by hydration. Often used
humectants are different types of glycols. Solids need to be soluble in the ink solution (this
can be maximized by changing the ink solvent composition) or stable as colloidal particles of
the right size. [7]
Solvent evaporation can also cause changes in the ink properties such as solubility and
viscosity (viscosity usually increases because of evaporation). The time that an ink can
successfully wait in an orifice without being jetted is called latency and this can vary from
seconds to several minutes, depending on ink [7]. Usually, inkjet printers have built-in
maintenance with nozzle-cleaning cycles with spitting and purging effects, where the nozzle
is cleaned from any unwanted substance in the nozzle [8]. Some printers (e.g. Dimatix
Materials Printer DMP-2800 Series), apart from a jetting wave form for print droplets, also
have a non-jetting wave form, “tickle control”. The non-jetting pulse signal is sent to the
printhead while it is moving in between printing of droplets and keeps the ink in the nozzle
in motion and prevents it from drying [15].
The ink’s behavior on the substrate is another factor that might ruin the quality of the print.
On top of a non-porous substrate, the ink droplets might cause “clusters” in case of underwetting and a high dot-gain. In case of too high speed of the jetted droplet, a splashing effect
might occur when the droplet hits the substrate. This is a result of when the rheological
properties of the ink do not match the rest of the printing set-up. The jetting speed can be
adjusted by the power of the piezoelectric impulse and the distance between the printhead
and the substrate. [7] [8]

Ink preparation and analysis
Theophylline

Anhydrous theophylline (Theophylline Anhydrous 200M, Orion Corporation) was used to
model APIs on different surfaces. Theophylline (1,3-dimethyl-xanthine) (see Figure 5) has
been used for 80 years. It is the most prescribed drug for airway diseases treatment and is
included in the World Health Organization´s (WHO) core of essential medicines. The molecule
is small, poorly water-soluble and forms slightly acidic solutions in water. Theophylline easily
undergoes hydrate–anhydrate

pseudopolymorphic transformations and shows a

cocrystallization behavior to form crystalline molecular complexes. This significantly affects
its solubility, stability and bioavailability. [78] [79]

Figure 5. Theophylline molecular structure

3.1.2

Ink preparation

The inks were prepared by dissolving a known amount of theophylline (API) powder in a
known volume of purified water (W) and was magnetically stirred (250 rpm) for 30-60 min at
room temperature. If the API did not dissolve, the solution temperature was increased to
50 °C and magnetically stirred for another 30 min. The co-solvents and additives, ethanol
(EtOH) (Spiritus Fortis / Ethanol 96%, Orion Corporation), glycerol (G) (Orion Corporation)
or propylene glycol (PG) (Orion Corporation) were added in known amounts and the solution
was magnetically stirred for yet another 15-60 min. Corresponding placebo inks, without API,
were also prepared. The final ink compositions and API concentrations are listed in Table 4.

Master’s Thesis

Density

An Anton Paar DSA 5000 densitometer (DSA, Density and Sound Velocity Analyzer) was used
to determine the density of the inks. The measurement cell uses an oscillating, thermostatic
U-formed capillary tube to measure the oscillating frequency for the sample injected in the
tube. The instrument was calibrated with cooked, ionized water and cleaned with purified
water, ethanol, acetone and pumped dry with the built-in air dryer for 5 min in between
samples. Ink sample (5 mL) was injected in the capillary tube and the measurements were
performed in 25 °C.

3.1.4

Viscosity

The viscosity of the inks was measured with an Ostwald viscometer. The Ostwald U-tube
measures the liquid’s running time (t) through a capillary tube from one point to another.
The running time is compared with a standard liquid’s running time from where the viscosity
constant, k, is calculated. The viscosity, η, can be calculated if the liquid’s density, ρ, is known.

𝜼 =𝒌∙ 𝝆∙ 𝒕

Equation 7.

The viscosity measurements where performed with a U-tube with viscosity constant k=0.016
(mPa*m3)/g. The U-tube was injected with 3 mL of ink sample and stabilized in a water bath,
25 °C for 5 min. The sample was prepared with a suction blub and the timer was managed by
hand. The tube was cleaned with purified water, ethanol, acetone and pressurized air. Each
ink was tested three times and a mean value for the running time was calculated.

3.1.5

Surface tension

Two types of tensiometers were used to determine surface tensions for the inks, a so-called
bubble tensiometer and a ring tensiometer.
Maximal Bubble Pressure was measured with SensaDyne (PC9000) which uses the YoungLaplace equation to calculate surface tension. Two capillary tubes were submerged in the

22

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

sample and a gas bubble was blown under the liquid surface. By knowing the diameter of the
capillary tubes, which will be the same as the diameter of the bubble, the maximum pressure
can be measured. By using two capillary tubes on slightly different levels, the effect of
hydrostatic pressure can be eliminated. The advantage with the Maximum Bubble Pressure
Method is that it measures both dynamic and static surface tension. [80]
The instrument was calibrated with cooked, distilled water and ethanol (Aas quality). An ink
sample of 100 mL was prepared in a beaker and measured three times in room temperature
(21-22 °C). A mean value for the ink’s surface tension was calculated. The tubes were cleaned
with water and ethanol in between samples.
The ring tensiometer, KSV Sigma 70, measures the maximum force with which a Pt-Ir circular
torsion wire is pulled from a liquid surface. The method is certainly sensitive for surface active
molecules in the phase boundary layer between the sample liquid and air.
The instrument was calibrated, and the measuring ring rolled into an even circle and burned
from potential residuals and impurities and cleaned with purified water, ethanol and
acetone. Ring measurement settings were set to Speed Up: 5.0 mm/min, Speed down 20.0
mm/min, Dwell Down 5.0%, Min No of Points 3, Min Meas. Time: 1.0 and Autozero. The
measurements were performed with 40 mL of sample in the small vessel in room
temperature, 21 °C. The vessel was washed with water, ethanol, acetone and pressurized air
in between the measurements.

3.1.6

Particle size

Particles size in the printing inks was measured with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), with a
Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS ZEN 3600 instrument. The instrument measures sub-micron sized
particles dispersed in a liquid by exposing the sample for a laser beam (632 nm). By measuring
the intensity of the scattered light, the velocity of the Brownian motion in the particles can
be determined, and according to Stokes-Einstein equation, the translational diffusion
coefficient and furthermore the particle size can be determined, with the assumption that
the particles have spherical shape.
The sample was prepared by injecting the ink sample into a UV grade cuvette (10-15 mm).
Measurements were performed with theophylline as material (refraction index (RI) 1.7 and
absorption 0.01) and dispersant according to the different ink composition. Primary solvent
23

Emma Engström

was set to water and the concentrations of the other ink components were added according
to their calculated concentrations (mol/L) in the ink. The software calculated the RI and
viscosity increment and the final, theoretical RI and viscosity of the ink-liquid. The
measurements were performed three times at 25 °C.

Printing
Dimatix DMP 2830 Material Printer

The printing experiments were performed with a FUJIFILM Dimatix DMP 2830 Material
Printer and associated cartridges for the inks (see Figure 6). The disposable 10 pL droplets
cartridge (model # DMC-11610 / PN 210020146) was injected with 1.5 mL of ink.

Cartridge

Figure 6. Dimatix Materials Printer DMP-2800 Series and associated ink cartridge. [15]

The cartridge has an ink pumping chamber, a fluid inlet passage with 16 individual nozzles,
spaced 256 µm apart which actuate and dispense the ink with a piezoelectric transducer. The
nozzles have 21.5 µm openings and the firing voltage and the waveform are user controlled
for each nozzle [15]. A “caffeine” waveform-setting (see Figure 7) was selected, since
theophylline has previously been printed with this waveform. Cartridge settings were set to
“no set temperature”, meniscus vacuum setpoint to 5.0 inches and “H20Print”. Cartridge
print height was set to 0.850 mm.

constructed as a ramp to dispense the ink liquid into spherical droplets. Tickle control prevents the liquid
from drying at the nozzle orifice in between ejected droplets.

A series of 1 cm2 × 1 cm2 square patterns with different drop spacings were edited and the
cartridge angle was adjusted manually according to the printer’s recommendations. The ink
was stabilized in the cartridge, attached to the printhead for one hour before printing. The
ink droplet firing temperature and the temperature of the substrate were not adjusted. The
firing voltage was set to 13-15 V to obtain optimized droplets (see Chapter 2.1.3) according
to the ink’s specific properties (surface tension, viscosity and API loading). The droplet firing
was observed with the drop-watcher function of the printer. One printing nozzle was selected
for printing. The height of the substrate was set according to the substrate and vacuum was
used to induce negative pressure in the printer. Printed samples were dried in a vacuum oven,
60 °C, pressure 1-10 Torr overnight to evaporate the solvents from the ink, leaving only API
on the substrate.

3.2.2

Printing substrates

Eight different printing substrates were used. Stainless steel, plexi, aluminum, epoxy (floor
material) and rubber (production sealant) test plates were received from Orion Corporation,
glass (Microscope Slides T/F Ground 1.0 mm, Fisher Scientific Oy) and paper (A4 copy paper,
Staples Europe B.V.) from Åbo Akademi University and enamel test plates (Glass-lines
samples, DD3009 blue plate, De Dietrich) from Thurne Teknik AB. The substrates are
commonly used materials in drug production facilities and paper was used as reference
substrate.

Surface energy of printed substrates

The SFE for the substrates was calculated from the determined contact angle of three liquids
with known surface tension, and the OWRK and vOCG theories presented in Chapter 2.2.3.
The used dispersive liquid was diiodomethane (DIM), and water and ethylene glycol (EG)
were used as polar liquids. The contact angles were measured with a KSV CAM200
goniometer (KSV Instruments Ltd.) and associated software. KSV's CAM 200 is a computercontrolled instrument which measures surface free energies, surface or/and interfacial
tensions of liquids, static and dynamic contact angles and absorption of liquids into porous
materials by video capturing and automatic image analysis based on Young-Laplace and
Bashforth-Adams theory.
Drops of 2 µL (EG and water) and 1.4 µL (DIM) were dosed by an automated syringe and
placed on the substrate manually with placer-screw. Then 25 pictures were taken with one
second interval from the moment the drop touched the surface and the contact angels were
calculated by the software. The experiment was repeated five times and a mean value for
the contact angle was plotted over time. One contact angle per each liquid on each substrate
was determined to be the stable equilibrium contact angle. Since the dispersive and polar
(acid-base) components for the liquids were known from the literature (listed in Table 3), the
vOCG and OWRK theories could be used to determine the SFE for the substrates.

using the measuring tool in the associated software, DinoCaptue 2.0 Version 1.5.39.C (AnMo
Electroics Corporation 2016).

Near infrared spectroscopy

A two-piece handheld NIR reflection spectral device N2.0 (Spectral Engines Oy) was used to
perform NIR measurements. The two units measure the absorbance spectra in the
wavelength range of 1.35-1.65 µm and 1.55-1.95 µm. Each unit has a single element indium
gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector and the illumination orifice (Ø 1 mm) is made of two
tungsten vacuum lamps. The instrument is never in direct contact with the sample, the
measurements are simply made from a 2 mm distance from the surface. [81]
Before starting the measurement, dark signal and reference of the clean substrate was
collected. Sample data was collected from 12 different spots from 4 parallel printed samples.
The illumination lamps were set to 50% or 100% of the lamps’ maximum voltage and the data
was collected with 5 nm steps throughout the range of wavelength.

3.3.3

Infrared spectroscopy

Infrared (IR) spectra were measured with a Nicolet iS50 Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.), which is a multirange FTIR spectrometer that has a wide range of different
applications. An iS50 ATR Module with single-bounce and single detector configuration was
used for Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) IR measurements. The module consists of a
diamond ATR crystal (Ø 5 mm) and a pressure tip with which the sample (e.g. plates, powders,
or liquids) is fastened.

The same Nicolet iS50 Spectrometer as for FTIR measurement was also used for Raman
measurements. The instrument uses a non-exchangeable 1064 nm laser excitation source
with a maximum power of 0.5 W, a Calcium fluoride (CaF2) beam splitter and a dedicated
InGaAs detector. The power was set to 0.05 or 0.5 W for the measurements.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

4.1

Suitable ink for printing

The first issue to take into consideration regarding printing of drugs is the drug-containing
ink. The carrier fluid can have different roles for the ink properties; these include 1) dissolving
of the API 2) carrying phase for a colloidal dispersion 3) adjust evaporating properties of the
ink. According to the literature, inkjet-printed pharmaceuticals often have a water-based
carrier fluid [3]. Water has a viscosity of 1 mPa*s in room temperature, which is usually too
low for printing and co-solvents or/and additives are usually needed. Daly presented that up
to 40% of drug-printing candidates have been abandoned due to poor aqueous solubility [3].
The requirements for the ink in this work are that the API, in this case Theophylline, needs to
be stable and preferably soluble in the ink fluid and that the ink needs to have the right
properties for the printing technique and specific printer.

4.1.1

Suitable ink formulation for printing

Ethanol and water were chosen as solvents due to the solubility of theophylline in respective,
15.19 mg/mL and 7.36 mg/mL [82]. Pure ethanol would have been favorable for both
solubility and for fast drying on the substrate, but to avoid the printing nozzles from drying
and clogging, a slowly evaporating ink is preferred. The manufacturer, FUJIFILM Dimatix Inc.,
also suggests adding glycol to the ink to slow the evaporation [15]. Propylene glycol and
glycerol were used as viscous additives, since both have previously been used in inkjet inks
[37] [83]. Sandler et al. used propylene glycol in a theophylline-containing ink, and the ink
formulation procedure was repeated and evaluated in this research (filtering excluded) [37].
It is possible to print inks with particles with the selected cartridges, but any particles should
preferably be smaller than 0.2 µm which corresponds to 100 times smaller than the nozzle
orifice [15]. It is suggested to filter the ink fluid through a 0.2 µm filter pre cartridge loading
[15]. Despite that, this step was neglected due to the crucial aspect of printed API
concentration in this research.
For surface tension measurements, two instruments were evaluated: a ring tensiometer and
a bubble tensiometer. The measurements slightly differed from each other, indicating that
some component in the inks was somewhat surface active. However, the maximum bubble

30

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

pressure method would be considered to model the droplet formation in the printing process
and the droplet impact on a solid surface and was therefore chosen as the method for surface
tension measurements [84]. Magadassi suggests that the ring tensiometer could be a
complement to the dynamic surface tension measured with a bubble tensiometer, but that
the bubble method still models the droplet formation in the printing process more truthfully
[7].
Altogether, 16 different inks were prepared, both with API and placebo. The inks were
analyzed for surface tension (bubble tensiometer), density, viscosity and particle size. The
results are summarized in Table 4. Viscosity was calculated with Equation 7, out of the
viscosity constant of the Ostwald U-tube, the liquids´ density and the running time through
the U-tube (see Chapter 3.1.4).
Table 4. Measured surface tension and density for the inks. The viscosity was calculated by Equation 7. The size
of particles in the inks was measured and the dominating particle size for each ink are listed. All measurements
were performed at 25 °C. The G:EtOH:W (10:45:45)-ink composition was determined to have the best
properties for printing and was prepared with several different concentrations of API.

As seen in Table 4, surface tension of the different ink compositions differs. Surface tension
of an API-containing ink and the corresponding placebo ink was similar. Ink densities were
about 1 g/cm3 for all ink compositions. Running time in the Oswald viscosimeter differed
widely among the inks, which indicates different viscosities of the inks. A trend where water
content relates to a higher surface tension was observed. The results also show that with
increasing amount of ethanol, the surface tension decreases and viscosity increases. It is also
noticeable that flocculation and particle aggregation displays as increased viscosity [7].

All inks, both API-containing and placebo, contained particles to some extent. Apart from
aggregated theophylline, the particles could have occurred in the solvents and/or additives
used in the inks or be contaminants, such as dust from the air. It was yet obvious that there
in some of the ink compositions had occurred some particle formation. A cloudiness was
observed in the PG:W-ink fluid containing API and DLS measurements also confirmed that
the ink contained particles bigger than 1400 nm. Since filtering was avoided in this research
(unlike in the Sandler research group [37]), glycerol was preferred as an additive in the inks,
since it barely showed signs of particle aggregation.
The manufacturer’s recommendations for ink viscosity and surface tension is 1-40 mPa*s
(preferably ca. 10 mPa*s) and 28-33 mN/m2 respectively [15]. Particle size is suggested to be
under 200 nm (100 times smaller than the nozzle orifice) [15]. None of the prepared inks
fulfilled all criteria, however, it was suggested to test print the G:EtOH:W (10:45:45)-inks,
since surface tension met the criteria for printing and the particle size was just slightly over
200 nm. The printings proceeded successfully although all the criteria were not fully met.
G:EtOH:W (10:45:45)-ink containing theophylline was slightly acidic (pH 6 measured with pH
paper), while the corresponding placebo ink was neutral (pH 7).

4.1.2

Calculated Re, We and Oh numbers

The characteristic numbers for droplet formation, Re, We and Oh numbers, for the different
ink compositions were calculated by Equation 1, 2 and 3 presented in Chapter 2.2.2, and
summarized in Table 5. Apart from some particle formation, the physicochemical properties
of the higher API-containing inks did not differ significantly from the corresponding placebo
ink and therefore is was decided to only calculate the characteristic numbers for the placebo
ink compositions. The measured surface tensions, densities and viscosities of the inks are
presented in Chapter 4.1.1, Table 4. The characteristic length, d, was set to the orifice
diameter of the printing nozzle, 21.5 µm. Since the velocity of the printed droplet was
unknown, but assumed to be between 7 and 9 m/s according to Dimatix’s recommendations,
an interval for Re and We numbers was calculated for each ink where minimum refers to a
velocity of 7 m/s and maximum to 9 m/s [15]. The Oh number can be calculated without
knowing the velocity (see Chapter 2.2.2).

The Re, We and Oh numbers of different ink compositions vary broadly because of their
different surface tensions, densities and viscosities. Figure 8 is a theoretical overview of
“printability” of the inks according to the characteristic numbers. The solid diagonal line
corresponds to Re=2/Oh and the kinetic energy of the jet ejected from the nozzle, while the
broken diagonal line corresponds to OhRe5/4=50 and the droplets impact on the substrate
(to avoid splashing) [3]. According to this theory, two of the ink compositions, PG:W (30: 70)
and G:EtOH:W (10:45:45), have the right properties for printing. However, in the APIcontaining PG:W (30: 70)-ink, theophylline was found to aggregate to bigger particles (1400
nm) and the ink is therefore not printable with the printer. The G:EtOH:W (10:45:45)-ink
composition was concluded to have the right physicochemical properties for printing and
was used throughout this work and is hereafter referred to as the “optimized ink
composition”.

Surface energy of substrates

The equilibrium contact angle for three different liquids was measured for each substrate.
Water and EG were used as polar liquids and while water has bipolar properties and equally
big acid-base components, the base component of EG is significantly larger than the acid
component (see Table 3). DIM was chosen as dispersive liquid.
All substrates except paper were non-absorbing and the measuring liquid stayed on the
surface for the whole measurement and the equilibrium contact angles were determined
without difficulties. Paper, however, absorbed all the three measuring liquids during
measurements and an equilibrium contact angle was therefore somewhat problematic to

have a significant lower SFE. Aluminum, enamel and glass (especially enamel and glass) were
noted to have significantly higher values for base and polar component.

According to Magadassi, spontaneous wetting occurs when an ink has lower surface tension
than the surface energy of the substrate [7]. The surface tension of the printed inks (with
optimized ink composition) was about 30 mN/m and lower than the SFE of all the substrates
except rubber. This results in larger dots (due to spreading) on the surface and a possibility
of droplets merging in case of closely printed droplets (small drop spacing). Magadassi also
34

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

suggests that to achieve smaller printed dots, e.g. for a higher printing resolution, the surface
tension should be high [7]. However, this thesis focuses on printed concentration of API on a
surface, and not necessarily the visual outcome of printing. Surface tension and SFE can
explain some specific behavior of an ink on a substrate (see Chapter 2.2.3), but a deeper
understanding of ink-surface interactions is achieved with consideration of surface
roughness. This is, however, considered to extend beyond the scope of this thesis.

Printing results

Inkjet-printed ink concentration can be adjusted in several ways. The focus of this thesis was
amount of API per surface area. Taking into consideration that the droplet volume is
standardized to 10 pL for the printing cartridges used in this work, three common ways of
adjusting the printed API concentration per area are listed below. These methods were all
investigated, with focus on adjusting the drop spacing, since it was determined to be the
most efficient method for adjusting API concentration per surface area for this application.
1. Adjusting the drop spacing (Chapter 4.2.1). By having an ink with a known
concentration of API, the amount of API on the printed area can be adjusted by the
quantity of droplets. A larger drop spacing results in fewer droplets per area (lower
dpi) and lower API concentration per area.
2. Adjusting the API concentration in the ink (Chapter 4.2.2). By changing the API
concentration in the ink and printing with a set drop spacing, different API
concentrations per area are achieved.
3. Printing several layers (Chapter 4.2.3). By printing several layers of API-containing ink,
the API amount per area is increased. This method also allows printing large amounts
of API, since it is neither restricted to solubility of the API, nor the printer’s limitations.

All methods are followed by their own limitations and challenges. Adjusting the drop spacing
(method 1) is limited by the maximum and minimum drop spacing of the printer. The printing
result can differ, depending on the ink’s wetting properties and the closeness of the printed
droplets. Closely printed droplets tend to merge into bigger drops, due to the law of
minimum surface tension and according to wetting on the surface (as a result of SFE). While
the amount of API per printed area is easily adjusted, the amounts of ink solvents and
additives are equally increased. This might affect printing results and analysis of the samples.
Adjusting the API concentration in the ink (method 2) is limited by the solubility of the API
and by the crucial printing properties such as ink stability, viscosity, and particle size. Since
the solvent-API ratio can differ, the solvent evaporation might vary depending on the ink.
Limitations for layer printing (method 3) include slower printing process, especially if the first
layer needs to dry before the second one is applied. Layer printing can affect the quality of
the finished print and top-surface analysis might give inaccurate results in case of API
concentration per area.

One single nozzle out of the 16 available in the cartridge was used for printing. This decision
was made due to the crucial aspect of printed API. By printing with a single nozzle, it was
possible to observe if the printing succeeded or if the nozzle clogged. This would not have
been possible by using several nozzles at once (if one or some of the nozzles clogged, there
would still be some ink printed on the substrate). Using several nozzles would, however,
speed up the printing process.

4.2.1

Method 1: Printed API concentration adjusted with drop spacing

The optimized ink composition containing 5.8 mg/mL of Theophylline was printed on the
eight different substrates with five different drop spacing settings, resulting in samples with
five different printed API concentrations per area, listed in Table 7. Parallel with these,
corresponding placebo samples without API were printed with the same drop spacing
settings.
Table 7. Listed drop spacing, and associated number of droplets per square centimeter (given by the printer’s
software). The droplet size was standardized to 10 pL and the API concentration in the ink is 5.8 mg/ml from
which the printed API per square centimeter was calculated.

Due to the varying porosity and color of the substrate, some prints were impossible to detect
optically (e.g. white paper as substrate). An alternative would have been to add a colorant to
the transparent ink, like Vakili et al. did in 2017 [81]. This was not preferred in this work since
the colorant could disturb spectrometric analysis. The API-containing inks, however, did turn
white when dried due to the color of theophylline, and was visible on most of the darker
colored substrates. As expected, the printed placebo samples were impossible to detect as
water and ethanol had evaporated during drying.

Figure 9 and Figure 10 are microscopic pictures of the five different printed API
concentrations per area on plexi and enamel, including a picture of the plain substrate
reference. Corresponding pictures of the printed API doses on each substrate are found in
the Appendix.
In Figure 9, plexi was used as substrate and the spacings between the printed dots were
measured with the DinoCapture software. The droplets of the higher printed API
concentrations (4.78, 58.12 and 118.60 µg/cm2) had merged together and formed an uneven
pattern of larger dots on the surface of the substrate (picture a and b). With the lowest
concentration of printed API, 0.59 µg/cm2, the printed droplets remained completely
separated on the surface and the set drop spacing (100 µm) was measured (picture e). An
even pattern of vertical and horizontal lines of dots was visible. With printed API
concentration of 2.34 µg/cm2, the printed droplets remained mainly separated (printed dot
spacing cohered with set drop spacing, 50 µm), but some merging of droplets was still visible
as irregularities in the pattern (picture d).

dose, 0.59 µg/cm2, the droplets remained separated (dot- and set drop spacing 100 µm
match) and for an API dose of 2.34 µg/cm2, some minor merging behavior was observed.
However, when printing the three highest doses of API (4.78, 58.12 and 118.60 µg/cm2), the
ink showed a totally different behavior on enamel compared with plexi, and the ink wetted
the surface completely. During drying, the highest API dose, 118.60 µg/cm2, showed some
crystallization effect with some larger crystals formed on the surface (picture a).
Concentrations of 4.78 and 58.12 µg/cm2 of printed API, however, dried as an even layer and
the theophylline particles were evenly distributed (picture b and c). The same wetting
behavior as for enamel appeared for printed glass samples, while printed API-ink on
aluminum, steel, epoxy and rubber behaved like on the plexi samples. The behavior can be
explained with the surface energies of the substrates and ink-substrate interaction. The high
base components of enamel and glass (concluded in Chapter 4.1.3) indicate on alkalic
surfaces and by printing a slightly acidic ink on the surface, the liquid wets the surface easily.
In other words, the surface energy of the substrate affects the behavior of ink on the surface.
Genia et al. and Hirshfield et al. found that the recrystallization behavior of a printed API
differed depending on the choice of printing substrate and the surface wettability [49] [65].
Hirshfield et al. also showed that the crystallization depended on the evaporation rate of the
printed sample and the volatility of the carrier fluid [49].

Method 2: Printed API concentration adjusted with ink concentration

By standardizing the drop spacing and adjusting the API concentration in the ink, the
corresponding API amounts per area as with method 1 (Chapter 4.2.1) were achieved. In an
ideal case, the drop spacing would be set so that the printed droplets remained separated
on the surface so that the API would be evenly distributed over the area. For the substrates
used in this work, this would mean a drop spacing between 50 and 100 µm. However, the ink
formulations were limited to the solubility of theophylline, which did not meet the
requirement for the desired API concentrations in the inks. Therefore, a standardized drop
spacing of 10 µm was settled and the inks formulated accordingly (see Table 8). Four
optimized ink composition with different concentrations of theophylline were printed on
three different substrates: aluminum, steel and glass. The fifth ink, 5.80 mg/mL, was already
printed with drop spacing 10 with method 1 (Chapter 4.2.1).
Table 8. Listed API concertation in inks. The droplet size was standardized to 10 pL, the drop spacing to 10 µm
(1 002 001 droplets per square centimeter) from which the printed API per square centimeter was calculated.

The ink with the highest API concentration, 11.84 mg/mL, clogged the printing nozzle midprinting and printed only a third of the designed square-pattern (118.60 µg/cm2). This is
assumed to be a result of solvent evaporation at the tip of the nozzle and due to high API
loading in the ink. In other words, the 11.84 mg/mL-ink has a shorter latency than the rest of
inks. The clogging could most likely have been avoided with automated nozzle-cleaning cycles
during the printing process, or by adjusting the non-jetting waveform (“tickle control”). The
printed areas were, however, large enough for analysis and the failed printed samples could
therefore still be used in this work.
The low API concentration inks, 0.06, 0.23 and 0.48 mg/mL, printed with drop spacing 10 µm,
showed coffee staining effect (presented in Chapter 2.1.3) on alumina and steel. In Figure 11,
the coffee staining effect is shown on the low API concentration samples, with printed API
concentrations of 4.78, 2.34 and 0.59 µg/cm2 on steel. The printed droplets had merged, and

the solid API accumulated along the outer edges of the dried ink drop (picture c, d and e).
Corresponding samples printed on alumina are found in the Appendix. On glass, however,
the inks behaved in a totally different way and wetted the surface completely (see Figure 12).
The dried API inks formed crystal patterns on the surface. This emphasizes the previously
presented results, where it was stated that due to the substrates’ high base component, the
slightly acidic API-ink behaves differently on glass and enamel than on the rest of the
substrates.

Method 3: Printed API concentration adjusted with printed layers

Four layers of the optimized ink composition containing 5.8 mg/mL of Theophylline was
printed with drop spacing 7 µm on glass sample plates. Each layer contained API 118.60
µg/cm2 and the layers were dried overnight and analyzed before the next layer was printed
on top of the previous one. The single printed layer contained 118.60 µg/cm2 of printed API,
the two layers 237.20 µg/cm2, the three layers 355.50 µg/cm2 and the four layers 474.40
µg/cm2. When a new layer of ink was printed on top of another dried layer of API, the solvents
in the ink seemed to redissolve the previously printed API. Figure 13 presents microscopic
pictures of the four printed API layers. In the first layer, 118.60 µg/cm2, the API has dried in
somewhat crystalline structures (picture a), while the other API layers have dried quite
uniformly. The third layer was printed slightly oblique from the previous layers and the
picture shows a distinct line of the layers (picture c). It is, however, concluded that escalating
layer-printing of high doses of API, did not affect the appearance of the prints remarkably.

Spectrometric analysis of prints

Three different spectrometric methods were used to analyze the printed API on surfaces, NIR,
IR and Raman spectroscopy. The methods were compared and evaluated for detecting small
amounts of theophylline on different surfaces. Due to the different ranges of wavelength,
the three methods measure different vibrations in the sample molecules. Because of the
different active ranges, the methods are considered to be complementary to each other,
since e.g. weak IR absorbance often corresponds to a strong Raman emitter. Raman bands
are usually sharper than IR, while NIR spectra are rougher. For rapid production analysis,
spectrometric methods could be preferred, given that the accuracy and sensitivity are
sufficient.

4.3.1

Results from NIR spectroscopy

NIR data was collected from printed paper and plexi samples of five differerent API
concentrations per area (concentrations adjusted with drop spacing, method 1) and
corresponding placebo samples. Multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA
and orthogonal partial least squares, OPLS regression) was made on the data using the
SIMCA® 14.1. software (MKS Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden).
In the first steps of building a model, it was already visible that the sample data did not
differantiate enough to build a model. This trend displayed for both substrates analyzed.
Neighter adjusted light intensity (from 50% to 100%), nor data pre-processing such as
standard normalized variate (SNV) and baseline correction improved the modelling. For
building a reliable model, the score scatter plot is expected to show significant clustering of
the different sampling groups. As seen in Figure 14, the only clustering effect is shown for
the two highest printed doses of API, 58.12 and 118.60 ug/cm2 respectively. The lower doses
of API did not differentiate from each other and cluster among the placebo samples. It was
concluded that this handheld NIR reflection spectral device was not sensitive enough to
detect the lower printed concentrations of API (4.78, 2.34 and 0.59 µg/cm2).

the non-pre-processed data from the plexi-samples. The two highest printed API concentrations (58.12 and
118.60 ug/cm2) show some clustering effect, but the lower printed API concentrations (4.78, 2.34 and 0.59
µg/cm2) were not detected by the instrument and cluster among the placebo-samples.

Vakili et al. used the same NIR probes to successfully detect printed levothyroxine and
prednisolone on orodispersible films in 2017 [81], but the printed drug concentration was
remarkably higher than the lowest concentrations printed in this work (lowest concentration
printed with 500 dpi, 80 pL droplets and API concentration of 20 mg/mL in ink, resulting in
printed API of about 60 µg/cm2).

Results from FTIR spectroscopy

The measured IR transmittance spectrum of pure theophylline powder is shown in Figure 15.
The powder was dried in a vacuum oven (80 Torr, 60°C) overnight before measurements to
remove excess water. The spectrum matches the reference spectra of anhydrous

Samples printed in five different concentrations on rubber and aluminum are shown in Figure
16 and Figure 17 respectively. The theophylline concentration per area was adjusted with
drop spacing (method 1) and the samples were dried in vacuum overnight before
measurements. Corresponding IR spectra of other substrates (steel, plexi, epoxy, enamel,
glass and paper) are found in Appendix. The spectra show peaks in the significant ranges for
theophylline, especially in the 1600-1700 cm-1 and 500 cm-1 regions. A trend where higher
API printed concentration correlates to bigger peaks was observed for respective substrate.
Depending on the substrate, the lowest concentrations of printed theophylline did not differ
sufficiently from the reference spectrum. The API amount was, however, concluded to be
extremely small and might reach the limit of detection for the instrument. Printed
theophylline was best shown with IR on aluminum and steel (detected API doses as low as
0.59-2.34 µg/cm2) and least shown on paper and rubber (detected API doses as low as 4.7858.12 µg/cm2).
Samples printed with placebo ink in different concentrations (corresponding to the API doses
adjusted with drop spacing, method 1) match the substrate’s reference spectrum for all
substrates, regardless of printed ink amount (see Appendix). This was rather predictable,
since the ink solvents were expected to evaporate during vacuum oven drying overnight.
Furthermore, it is concluded that the increasing peaks for the API-samples is due to
increasing amount of printed theophylline and not increasing amount of printed ink solution.

In Figure 19, IR spectra of glass samples printed with method 1 and 2 were compared to each
other. The printed API concentration is either achieved by adjusting the drops spacing
(method 1) or API concentration in the ink (method 2). According to Figure 19, samples
printed with method 2 have more significant IR peaks than the samples printed with method
1. However, by comparing Figure 16 to Figure 17, aluminum samples printed with method 1
have some small IR peaks even at lower concentration (2.34 µg/cm2), while corresponding
sample printed with method 2 did not show any IR peaks. This could be a result of the
inhomogeneous printed area due to merging of droplets and that only one analysis was done
per sample. An alternative for circumvention is repeated analyses from several different
spots of the samples.

The printed API concentration was drastically increasing by printing several layers of API on

overnight and analyzed before the next layer was printed on top of the previous one. The IR
spectra (Figure 20) did not show a significant difference between the printed layers (printed
API concentration 118.60, 237.20, 355.50 and 474.40 µg/cm2). The printed API per area is yet
proportionally high for all printed layers and the API covers the surface almost completely
for all printed concentrations (see Figure 13).

Results from Raman spectroscopy

Raman absorbance spectra of the pure theophylline powder (Figure 21) matched reference
spectra from the literature [78]. However, the glass sample, printed with escalating doses of
API by printing several layers on top of one another (method 3), did not show any Raman
absorbance peaks whatsoever (see Figure 21). Different instrument power settings were
tested (0.05-0.5 W). The results were surprisingly unsatisfactory, since the printed API
concentrations were proportionally high (118.60, 237.20, 355.50 and 474.40 µg/cm2),
compared to samples printed with method 1 and 2 and detected with FTIR.

CONCLUSIONS

When printing pharmaceuticals, the intention of the final product is of great importance in
aspect to accuracy, consistency, ink-substrate adhesion and stability of both ink and the final
product. The investigation of this thesis was focused on applying small amounts (µg) of API
on different materials used in drug production facilities, and therefore differs notably from
the majority of previously done studies, which often focus on printing APIs on different
porous substrates, intended to be consumed. In those cases, factors like bioavailability and
toxicity need to be taken into consideration in a whole other way than in this work, where
the printed product is intended to eventually be used for cleaning validation purposes.
Compared to the majority of previously done studies on printing of APIs, this work faces new
challenges and gives a wider perspective on inkjet printing of APIs.
The most important factor for a successful print is the API-containing ink formulation and its
applicability for the printer. The physicochemical properties of a printable ink must lie within
a narrow window in aspect to surface tension, viscosity, density and the API’s solubility or
stability as colloidal particles of suitable sizes in the ink liquid is crucial. An ink solution
consisting of glycerol, ethanol and water as carrier fluids in ratio 10:45:45 was concluded to
be suitable for printing theophylline with Dimatix DMP 2830 material printer (10 pL droplet
cartridges) with a preset “caffeine” waveform and 13-15 V piezoelectric droplet firing.
The optimal theophylline loading in the ink was concluded to be 5.8 mg/mL, but other inkconcentrations were also printed, but with less successful printing results. Lower
theophylline-loaded inks (0.06, 0.23, 0.48 mg/mL) tended to show a coffee staining effect
when printed and dried on a surface. This was concluded to be a result of API-particle
accumulation among the outer edges of the ink droplet, while the ink-solvents evaporated.
An ink loaded with theophylline 11.84 mg/mL, clogged the nozzle mid printing due to high
API-loading and solvent evaporation at the nozzle. However, the ink was yet printable, and
the nozzle clogging could most probably be avoided by adjusting the jetting and non-jetting
waveform and/or add automated nozzle cleaning, maintenance cycles. Another way of
achieving high API-loaded inks, limited by the solubility of the API, would have been adjusting
the ink solvents. Acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are known for dissolving poorly
soluble APIs and have previously been used in various printings. Nanosuspensions and
nanoemulsions of APIs could also be used to increase the loading of poorly soluble APIs in
carrier fluids. The ink-printer and ink-substrate combability is yet needed to be taken into
49

consideration, as well as the previously mentioned physicochemical properties for a printable
ink. Another perspective is printhead design development. Today, a lot of research is focused
on development of printable API-containing fluids and applying it to already existing printing
technology. But by taking printhead design and underlying technology into consideration
when developing printed pharmaceuticals, the opportunities widen remarkably. [3]
Different amounts of theophylline were successfully printed on all of the eight different
substrates investigated. The printed theophylline-ink behaved different on the surfaces of
the different substrates. Paper was used as reference substate and the porous structure
absorbed ink, while the other substrates, steel, aluminum, glass, plexi, enamel, epoxy and
rubber, were non-porous and the ink remained and dried on the surface. It was concluded
that the surface properties such as dispersive, polar, acid and base components of surface
energy, as well as the surface roughness, determined the ink-substate behavior. According
to the choice of substrate and how closely the ink droplets were printed, the droplets
remained separated on the surface or merged into bigger units or wetted the surface entirely
(only on glass and enamel).
The fundamental part for being able to utilize printed APIs for cleaning validation purposes,
is the printed amount of API per area. In this work, three methods were used for adjusting
the theophylline amount per area and one showed more potential than the others. The
optimized ink composition containing 5.8 mg/mL theophylline was successfully printed on all
substrates in five different concentrations per area (0.59, 2.34, 4.78, 58.12, 118.60 µg/cm2)
by adjusting the drop spacing. This was presented to be the most suitable method for
adjusting the printed API concentration per area for this work. The printed theophylline dose
per area was also increased drastically by printing several layers of ink with the highest API
dose, 118.60 µg/cm2, on each other. Since the layers where dried in a vacuum oven over
night, before the next layer was printed on top of the previous one, this method was rather
time consuming and could only be recommended for printing high doses of API per area,
when the maximum API loading in the ink, limited to the solubility of the API, is exceeded.
Of the three spectrometric methods used for analyzing the printed samples, FTIR-ATR is
concluded to be the most sensitive of them. The handheld two-piece NIR device did not seem
to be sensitive enough to detect the lower doses of printed API and in the first crucial steps
of PCA multivariate analyses, only printed API doses higher than 58.12 µg/cm2 were detected.
This device could possibly be suitable for in- or on-line measurements, or for detecting higher

50

Master’s Thesis

doses of API in drug production facilities with higher MAC, but not necessarily for the strictest
MACs. It is yet found that the NIR-device is rather old (> 10 years) and that newer devices
with better technology are already available on the market. It is suggested that more
research is done on newer handheld NIR-devices, to scope the potential for NIR as a sensitive
and reliable method for detecting small amounts of APIs on surfaces.
While the pure theophylline powder was detected with Raman spectroscopy (1064 nm laser),
none of the printed samples (highest API dose 474.40 µg/cm2) showed any Raman signal
whatsoever. The results were surprisingly unsatisfactory since Raman is commonly known
for being a rather sensitive analytical method. An option would have been to analyze the
samples with other Raman wavelengths (another laser) and thereafter determine the
sensitivity for Raman.
Theophylline concentrations as low as 2.34 µg/cm2 were detected with a stationary FTIR-ATR
on aluminum, steel, glass and plexi. The IR-peaks were quite weak, but still noticeable for the
lower concentrations of printed API, while the higher printed API concentrations (58.12,
µg/cm2 and higher) showed clear theophylline peaks with FTIR spectroscopy on all
investigated substrates. It is yet concluded that the surface of printed API was
inhomogeneous and that the API did not spread evenly on the surface due to merging of
droplets. Repetitive analysis would be needed to get a representative result of a printed
sample area. However, the investigation showed promising results for spectrometric
methods for detecting small amounts API on different surfaces. Several handheld
spectrometric instruments are already available on the market and depending on the
reliability and sensitivity of the handheld instruments, these could potentially be used
parallel or even replace currently used HPLC analysis.
It is determined that inkjet printing is an effective way to dispense small doses of APIs on
different surfaces and shows potential for generating precise calibration standards.
Escalating doses are proven to be detected both visually and by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy.
Needless to say, that more research and pharmaceutical method validation would be needed
to justify printing as an accurate and reliable method for prototyping drug residuals in
production facilities and pipelines. More research with printing of different APIs, dilution
series and analytical sampling would be needed to successfully do a multivariate analysis.
However, printing as technology shows great potential for the pharmaceutical industry in
aspect to analytical instrument development and calibration.

SWEDISH SUMMARY
Tryckning och spektrometrisk detektering av aktiva farmaceutiska substanser
på olika ytor

Bläckstråletryckning anses vara en exakt och relativt snabb metod för noggrann dosering av
material. I och med flexibla möjligheter för mönster och dosering har tekniken visat potential
för medicinsk teknologi, biomedicin och läkemedelsindustrin i form av personligt framställda
medicinska produkter. Mycket forskning görs inom området och de första bläckstråletryckta
medicinska produkterna finns redan på marknaden. Förutom framställning av produkter
ämnade att konsumeras, har bläckstråletryckning även potential att utnyttjas inom andra
områden i läkemedelsindustrin som t.ex. för att modellera läkemedelsrester i
produktionsanläggningar. Tryckta modeller för läkemedelsrester kunde användas för att
kalibrera både redan etablerade analysinstrument för renlighetsvalideringar och i
utvecklingen av nya analysinstrument. Med hjälp av bläckstråletryckning modelleras i den
här

avhandlingen

produktionsanläggningar för läkemedel. Fokus för arbetet var att framställa ett tryckbart
bläck som innehåller läkemedel (teofyllin), trycka bläcket på åtta olika material i olika
koncentrationer per area (0,59-474,4 µg/cm2) och undersöka de tryckta proverna med tre
olika spektroskopiska metoder: IR, NIR och Raman.
Den första utmaningen för att trycka ett läkemedel är att framställa ett bläck med rätt
tryckningsegenskaper för ifrågavarande tryckmetod. De tre mest betydelsefulla fysikaliskkemiska bläckegenskaperna för bläckstråletryckning är ytspänning, viskositet och
partikelstorlek. Ett läkemedel kan antingen bilda en kolloidal dispersion och/eller vara
upplöst i bläcklösningen. Läkemedlets löslighet och/eller storleken på de kolloidala
partiklarna är begränsande faktorer för framställningen av ett tryckbart bläck. Både bläckets
ytspänning och viskositet har inverkan på hur en droppe formas i munstyckets öppning,
avlossas och beter sig på substratets yta. Bläckegenskaperna kan justeras med att variera
sammansättningen på transportvätskan med lösningsmedel och tillsatsämnen. I arbetet
framställdes flera sammansättningar av bläck som innehöll teofyllin och bläckens fysikaliskkemiska egenskaper undersöktes. Slutsatsen av laborationerna var att ett bläck bestående
av glycerol, etanol och vatten i förhållande 10 %, 45 % och 45 %, och med olika
koncentrationer av teofyllin mellan 0,06 - 12 mg/mL, fungerade för bläckstråletryckning.

52

Emma Engström

Master’s Thesis

I avhandlingen användes en bläckstråletryckare med Drop-on-Demand-piezoelektrisk
dosering. Bläckkassetterna, med ett teofyllin-bläck sattes fast på ett rörligt skrivhuvud som
rörde sig över substratet och skrev ut ett förinställt mönster med hjälp av 10 pL:s droppar.
Det tryckta mönstret var kvadratiska rutor med sidlängden 1 cm och de tryckta proverna
torkades i vacuumugn över natten för att evaporera bläckets lösningsmedel innan analyserna.
Den tryckta koncentrationen teofyllin per area varierades med tre olika metoder, nämligen
1) genom att använda ett bläck med teofyllin i koncentrationen 5,8 mg/mL och variera
avståndet mellan de tryckta dropparna (7, 10, 35, 50 och 100 µm) 2) genom att standardisera
droppavståndet till 10 µm och variera teofyllinkoncentrationen i bläcket (0,06, 0,23, 0,48,
5,80, 11,84 mg/mL) 3) genom att trycka flera lager av bläck på varandra (droppavstånd 7 µm
och teofyllinkoncentration 5,8 mg/mL). Metod 1 konstaterades dock lämpa sig bäst för det
här arbetes ändamål.
Åtta olika material användes som substrat för tryckningarna: aluminium, stål, epoxi, glas,
plexi, emalj, gummi och papper. De sju förstnämnda är material som ofta förekommer i
produktionsanläggningar för framställning av läkemedel och papper användes som
referensmaterial för tryckningarna. På grund av substratens varierande ytenergier, vätte det
tryckta bläcket ytorna olika. Papper var poröst och absorberade bläcket medan resten av
substraten var oporösa och nära tryckta bläckdroppar slogs i vissa fall samman till större
droppar som ett resultat av vätning, ytspänning och lagen om minimerad ytenergi. Vid
torkning evaporerade lösningsmedlen i bläcket och teofyllin kvarlämnades som punkter eller
kristallenheter på substratets yta. Det konstaterades att på grund av teofyllinets sura pH,
vätte bläcket ytor med hög baskomponent, glas och emalj, fullständigt.
För NIR-analyser användes ett handhållet instrument med analysområde 1350-1950 nm och
för IR- samt Ramananalyserna användes en spektrometer. IR-analyser gjordes med FTIR-ATR
(400-4000 cm-1) och Raman med 1064 nm laser (100-3600 cm-1). Det visade sig att varken
NIR- eller Ramaninstrumenten var tillräckligt känsliga för att analysera de små mängderna
tryckt teofyllin på de olika substraten. I IR-analyserna däremot, framträdde de signifikanta
topparna för teofyllin i spektra för samtliga koncentrationer av tryckt teofyllin. Dock var
topparna för de lägsta koncentrationerna av teofyllin ytterst små på grund av de låga halterna
läkemedel per area (0,59 och 2,34 µg/cm2). Förutom de tryckta proverna med eskalerande
doser av teofyllin, trycktes även parallella prover med ett placebo-bläck (utan läkemedel) för
att garantera att analyserna indikerade på ökad mängd teofyllin, och inte ökad mängd
bläcklösning. Som förväntat evaporerade allt tryckt placebo-bläck från ytorna och samtliga
53

placebo-provers IR-spektra motsvarade substratens referensspektrum. Det kan alltså
konstateras att en ökad dos tryckt teofyllin ger större utslag (toppar) i IR-spektra på samtliga
substrat.
Tryckning av aktiva farmaceutiska substanser konstateras vara ett effektivt sätt att dosera
små mändger läkemedel på olika ytor och påvisar stor potential för att framställa standarder
för renlighetsvalideringar i läkemedelsindustrin. Tryckta standarder kunde användas för
kalibrering av redan etablerede analysmetoder för renlighetsvalideringar och i utvecklingen
av nya analysinstrument.
