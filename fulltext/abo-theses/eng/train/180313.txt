Abstract
Steel has been produced for thousands of years, but its extensive, industrial use began
during the industrialization, with the introduction of more efficient production
methods, such as the blast furnace. The global consumption of steel has been steadily
increasing until the present time, with the most significant growth occurring during the
last couple of decades as steel is used in different areas, such as manufacturing and
infrastructure. The consumption of steel has been considered a good indicator of
economic growth, which can be observed in, e.g., the rising economies of Asia; in
2018, the global steel production was approximately 1.80 billion tonnes.
Due to the steady increase in steel consumption, the producers are not only required to
be competitive and efficient, but to also find ways of reducing carbon dioxide
emissions. As the steelmaking process works with molten metal or hot semi-finished
products, the process requires a great deal of both energy (heat) and raw materials. In
particular, the production of liquid iron in the ironmaking process, which is essential
to produce steel, is energy consuming. In this process, molten iron is obtained from
iron ore and the most common process for this is a blast furnace. Simplified, the
furnace is charged with iron ore and coke, with coke being the primary reductant and
energy source of the furnace. As carbon is the primary reduction agent and fuel, the
resulting carbon dioxide emissions have lately caused concern. This has led to a search
for other less emitting alternative reductants that would also supply the furnace with
adequate heat. One such alternative is (liquefied) natural gas, or LNG, which primarily
consists of methane.
The subject of this study is to evaluate the potential of using natural gas for reducing
the emissions at SSAB Raahe Steelworks, with focus put on the energy balance. Since
the steelworks does not have access to natural gas by pipeline, the study is focused on
the use of liquefied natural gas. The introduction of natural gas at different locations
at the steelworks that are thought to influence the total emissions on-site is studied
computationally. As the blast furnace needs considerable amounts of both heat and

II

reducing agent, this is the process where the biggest reduction in emissions is expected
and it is therefore given most attention.
A nonlinear model of the steelworks is used in order to minimize the emissions. As
Raahe Steelworks is the setting, on-site production, energy and gas data are used in
the calculations. The results indicate that there is a significant potential for reducing
emissions by using natural gas. With the current technical limitations, the lowest
overall emissions can be reached when the injection rates of natural gas and pulverized
coal are approximately 84 and 66 kg per ton hot metal, respectively. This injection rate
corresponds to an emissions reduction of 90 kg per ton steel. However, it is proposed
that a natural gas injection rate of approximately 40 kg per ton hot metal would be
more plausible in the short term. This injection rate gave an emission reduction of
approximately 50 kg per ton steel.
Reducing emissions by changing fuels to natural gas was studied in the power plant,
scrap cutting and machine planer. For the power plant, replacing heating oil with
LNG led to an emissions reduction of approximately 5%, whereas for the scrap
cutting and machine planer, replacing LPG with LNG led to an emissions reduction
of approximately 15%.

Abstrakt
Stål har tillverkats i tusentals år, men dess industriella användning började under
industrialiseringen då mer effektiva produktionsmetoder, såsom masugn, började
tillämpas. Den globala konsumtionen av stål har ökat kraftigt, men den mest betydande
ökningen har skett under de senaste decennierna i och med att stål används inom olika
områden, såsom tillverkning och infrastruktur. Således har konsumtionen ansetts vara
en bra indikation på ekonomisk tillväxt, vilket kan observeras i t.ex. de växande
ekonomierna i Asien. År 2018 var den globala stålproduktionen cirka 1,80 miljarder
ton.

Ökningen i den globala konsumtionen av råstål har också medfört andra krav på
producenter. Vid sidan om att vara både effektiva och ekonomiska, krävs också att de
söker efter sätt att minska koldioxidutsläpp. Eftersom stålframställningsprocessen
handlar om att arbeta med smält metall och varma halvfabrikat kräver processen
mycket energi (i form av värme) och råmaterial, speciellt för att erhålla smält järn i
järntillverkningsprocessen. Järntillverkningen, som producerar smält råjärn ur
järnmalm, sker främst i masugnar. Ugnen matas med järnmalm och koks, där koks
utgör ugnens primära bränsle och kolkälla för reducering av malmen. Eftersom kol är
en viktig komponent i processen, har de resulterande koldioxidutsläppen blivit kritiska
pga. växthuseffekten. Detta har lett till att man sökt efter andra alternativ med mindre
utsläpp, som ändå skulle förse ugnen med tillräckliga mängder reduktionsmedel och
energi. Ett sådant alternativ är flytande naturgas, som främst består av metan.

Syftet med detta arbete är att utvärdera potentialen i att använda flytande naturgas för
att minska utsläppen vid SSAB Brahestad, med fokus på stålverkets energibalans.
Detta studeras beräkningstekniskt genom att analysera fall där naturgas införs på olika
ställen i stålverket där gasen antogs ha möjlighet att minska de totala CO2-utsläppen.
Eftersom masugnen behöver betydande mängder av både energi och reduktionsmedel
förväntas också den största minskningspotentialen av utsläpp finnas här. Således fästes
speciellt uppmärksamhet på detta område i arbetet.

En icke-linjär simuleringsmodell användes för att minimera stålverkets utsläpp.
Resultaten indikerade att det finns en betydande potential att minska utsläppen genom
att använda naturgas vid stålverket. Med de nuvarande tekniska begränsningarna

stålverket

när

injektionsmängderna för naturgas och kolpulver var cirka 84 kg/trj respektive 66 kg/trj
(där trj betecknar ton råjärn). Härvid minskade koksförbrukningen i masugnen med
cirka 8 %. Stålverkets förbrukning av naturgas skulle dock vara betydande och det
förefaller osannolikt att så stora mängder naturgas kunde levereras och hanteras på
verket inom nära framtid. Därför anser författaren att en naturgasinjektionsmängd på
omkring 40 kg/trj (vid en kolpulverinjektion på ca. 110 kg/trj), med en minskning av
koksförbrukningen med 5 %, kunde vara ett mer realistiskt koncept. Detta skulle
minska de totala utsläppen med cirka 50 kg per ton stål, vilket är en betydande
förbättring jämfört med basfallet.
Att byta bränsle till naturgas ledde också till några minskningar i stålverkets utsläpp
som härstammar från andra delar av processen. Maskiner som ursprungligen drivs med
LPG (skrotning och hyvling) uppvisade nästan 15 % lägre utsläpp efter bränslebytet
till naturgas. Om kraftverket skulle byta brännolja till naturgas vore den estimerade
utsläppsminskning ca 5 %.

1. Introduction
Steel is an important commodity that is used in areas such as manufacturing,
infrastructure, construction and different consumer products. When evaluating
national growth, steel usage is a good indicator. This can be observed especially in the
rising Asian economies, such as China and India. Growth is also expected across the
globe with increasing population and urbanisation. In the end of 2018, the total
production quantity of crude steel was roughly 1.8 billion tonnes worldwide, with
China alone contributing to almost a billion tonnes or 51% of the total production
(World Steel Association, 2019). In comparison, the total production quantity 10 years
prior amounted to 1.3 billion tons, with the Chinese share being 38% of the total
production. The production rates for year 2018 are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Crude steel production year 2018 (World Steel Association, 2019)

1.1 Background
In the European Union, steel has for a long time been considered both a strategic and
an important economical resource for employment, fostering economic growth and

1

innovations. Of the global production of steel, the cross-borders production in 23 EU
countries amounted to approximately 9.3% (World Steel Association, 2019). As the
production of steel requires a great deal of resources and energy, the resulting CO 2
emissions have been scrutinized lately. For production facilities in the EU countries,
the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) contains the emissions criteria for
production facilities and factories. According to the directive, the different industries
are expected to optimize their production and to minimize emissions (European
Commission, 2020). When it comes to companies in the steel industry, one such
company is the Swedish-Finnish SSAB, with their goal of excluding all fossil fuels
from their production by the year 2045. A huge benchmark in this endeavour is the
HYBRIT project, with the goal of replacing the blast furnace by a hydrogen-based
reduction unit, producing direct reduced iron (DRI) as a feed material to an electric arc
furnace. With this project, the company wants to significantly lower their CO2
emissions (SSAB, 2020).
While projects like this are expected to significantly reduce emissions associated with
iron production, it will take time until they are successfully implemented and operated
on a factory scale. Therefore, other options should be pursued in order to reduce
emissions during a transition period. Emissions can be reduced by switching reductants
to less emitting alternatives, e.g., to liquefied natural gas or LNG. Compared to larger
hydrocarbons, such as heavy fuel oil or light fuel oil, LNG consists for the most part
of methane; between 85 to 95% (DOE, 2013, p. 3), but also holds small amounts of
other carbohydrates, e.g., ethane (C2H6). In contrast, a methane molecule consists of
one carbon atom, whereas, other larger fuel molecules, such as fuel oils, may have
carbon chain lengths of up to 50 carbon atoms (MFE, 2011). Comparatively, LNG has
a potential for lowering CO2 emissions as it has a hydrogen to carbon ratio of 3.4 – 4,
depending on the content of methane (Schriesheim, 1978).

1.2 Subject of study
The purpose of this thesis is to study the potential of using LNG in lowering CO2
emissions at SSAB Raahe Steelworks. For assessing the potential, key areas are
2

identified where replacing fuels with LNG could have an effect on the whole
steelwork’s emissions; injecting NG in the blast furnaces and changing the energy
source to LNG for some other selected process units. These areas are presented in a
table in Appendix I.
At the blast furnace, the introduction of LNG will be studied as an injectant
(combustion), supply of hydrogen (reduction agent), a conveyer gas for the pulverized
coal and as a coolant for the coal lance. In addition, the potential of heating blast with
LNG will be studied.
The possibility of using LNG to replace by-product gases and other fuels will be
studied; locations where coke oven gas (COG) could be replaced with LNG are the
lime kilns, power plant, coke plant and the ladle heating unit at the steel plant. Also,
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used in the scrap cutting and machine planer units could
be replaced with LNG and an estimation on the potential emissions reduction will be
given; these are known at the steelworks as secondary steel flame cutting and flamescarfing machine for slab conditioning. Special focus is put on the energy balance of
the steelwork; the production and consumption of by-product gases, blast furnace gas
(BFG) and COG, electricity and district heat.

1.3 Method and restrictions
A mathematical model of the steelworks has been developed in earlier work (Helle et
al., 2011) and is applied in the present work in order to find the emissions for the
steelworks under different operating conditions. As Raahe steelworks is the setting,
on-site production, energy and gas data will be used for the calculations. In order to
evaluate the potential reduction of CO2 emissions, the model is fitted to steelworks
data; a base case of the steelworks is obtained and is used as a reference point when
evaluating the effects of using LNG.
As the blast furnace is the area where the introduction of LNG is thought to have the
largest positive effect on emissions, the model will solve the total emissions of the
3

steelworks by gradually increasing the injection of natural gas (while lowering coal
injection). Most emphasis is put on the blast furnace operations, as the introduction of
LNG will not only have a thermal effect but will also affect the reduction processes in
the furnace. The modelled steelworks will be studied under different production rates
with the assumption that the steelworks is operated under steady-state conditions. The
studied production rates are 260 t/h, 290 t/h and 320 t/h, which reflect possible future
production levels of the plant.
The main emphasis is placed on observing the effect of introducing LNG in hot metal
production on the rate of reductants. Other production units, such as, the rolling mills
and steel plant, are tied to production rates without considering efficiency-related
questions (impact on, e.g., fuel consumption). For calculating the emissions estimates
and the energy balance, this impact is assumed to be small and is, therefore, excluded
from the analysis of the thesis.

1.4 Disposition
The thesis consists of ten chapters with the first chapter providing an introduction.
Chapter two presents the studied steelworks with overall descriptions of the processes
at Raahe. Chapter three illustrates the energy and emissions statistics for the steelworks
in 2019. In chapters four and five, the main theory applied in the work is presented,
including fuel analysis, combustion and the use of natural gas in hot metal production.
The model operation principle, equations and some selected variables and parameters
are presented in chapter six, which is followed by a chapter on model validation,
factors and limitations. In the seventh chapter, the model is fitted to steelworks data
and is used to determine a base-case situation for the modelled plant; this case is then
gradually modified by applying different injection rates. Chapters eight and nine
present the model results, with the former focusing on the changes in the energy
balance and fuel consumption of the steelworks, and the latter presenting the results
on the main study subject of the thesis, namely the potential for CO2 emissions
reduction. Finally, the studied cases and results are summarized in the tenth chapter
with some closing remarks on the subject, thoughts on outcome and ideas for future
work.

2. Process overview of Raahe Steelworks
The steelworks at Raahe is fully integrated with an annual crude steel production of
approximately 3 million tons and a coke production of 0.8 million tons. The plant
consists of production units for coke, burnt lime, electricity, oxygen, hot metal, steel
and the final products of hot rolled steel plates and coils. Figure 2 shows the different
production stages in Raahe. The main production units will be discussed with respect
to production quantities, giving simple descriptions of the units. The units at Raahe are
presented in their respective production stage; coking plant, hot metal production, steel
production, rolling mills, power plant, air separation units (ASUs) and lime kilns.

Figure 2: Production stages at SSAB Raahe steelworks (SSAB, 2018).

2.1 Coke plant
The coke plant produces coke for the blast furnaces. Coke is a fuel that is rich in carbon
and is made by heating coal in the absence of oxygen in a process called carbonization.
It is also sometimes referred to as dry distillation of coal. The production is carried out
by baking coal in the ovens at a temperature of approximately 1400 K (Coke
Production for Blast Furnace Ironmaking, 2020). In this process the volatile
5

compounds (including water) are driven off and the organic residues in coal are
evaporated and decomposed in an inert atmosphere. The non-volatile parts of the fuel
are mostly carbon. Coke is used in the blast furnace as the primary fuel and as a
reducing agent in smelting iron ore. About 22 wt% of the coal is converted to coke
oven gas (COG) which is a by-product of coke production (Thermopedia.com, 2020).
COG is a fuel gas which at Raahe steel plant is used at different parts of the production
process; for heating the coke plant’s batteries, in the power plant, rolling mills, steel
shop and lime kilns. The dry quenching unit (CDQ) of the coke plant has three boilers
with a combined steam capacity of 44 MW (82 bar, 525 C). CDQ improves the quality
of the produced coke as it reduces blast furnaces coke consumption, making it more
environmental and ecological (Seetharaman, 2014, p. 26). The coke plant in Raahe
consists of batteries 1 and 2. The former is heated by combustion of COG and blast
furnace gas (BFG), whereas the latter is heated with COG. The production of coke
amounts to about 90% of the total consumption (0.8 million tons) and the remaining
10% is purchased.

2.2 Hot metal production
Hot metal production in the steelworks is carried out by using two blast furnaces BF1
(“masuuni 1”) and BF2 (“masuuni 2”), cf. Figure 3. For each of these furnaces there
are three cowpers for heating of the combustion air (“blast”) and three blowers; MP03
for furnace 1, MP02 for furnace 2 and MP01, which is mostly used as a back-up
whenever any of the other two are being serviced. The blast furnace pulverised coal
injection system is also illustrated in the figure.

6

Figure 3: Sketch showing how the blast furnaces, cowpers and blowers are coupled
(own illustration).

2.2.1 Cowpers
Cowpers, or hot stoves, are used for preheating the mixture of air and oxygen that is
blown into the blast furnaces as combustion air. The mixture is preheated through
regenerative heat exchangers inside the three cowpers; during operation, two of them
are preheated while one is used for heating the blast. The stoves are made of ceramic
materials in a matrix called chequerwork.
During the blast preheating, BFG is burned in the combustion chamber of the stove
and the flue gases are passed through the matrix heating the brickwork to
approximately 1500 K close to the hot gas inlet and 600 K at the outlet. When a
sufficient stove temperature is reached, the heating of the blast commences. The
compressed air is blown into the matrix, in opposite direction compared to the stove
preheating, before being blown into the blast furnace (see Figure 4) at its base through
nozzles, called tuyeres (Guthrie, 1989). As the blast is preheated, the energy efficiency
and productivity of the blast furnace is considerably improved. Table 1 reports the
performance characteristics of the stoves in Raahe.

2.2.2 Blast furnace blowers
Before heating the blast, the air mixture is compressed by using blowers. SSAB Raahe
uses electrical blowers. The air exits the blowers at a pressure of 2.5 bars gauge
8

pressure. As shown in Figure 3, the MP03 blower is primarily connected to BF 1 with
a capacity of 150 000 Nm3/h air, while MP02 is primarily connected to BF 2 with the
same capacity. MP01 has a somewhat smaller capacity, 140 000 Nm3/h, but this is
primarily used in cases when one of the other blowers is out of commission.
Furthermore, the air is enriched with oxygen depending on the optimal operation
parameters of the blast furnaces; currently the upper limit for the blowers is 30 vol%
oxygen. Table 2 shows the blower capacities and main energy sources.

2.2.3 Blast furnaces
Blast furnace is a chemical reactor for reducing iron ore oxides, e.g., in the form of
pellets, to metallic iron. The blast furnace is a vertical shaft oven (Figure 5) with a
height of 20 – 35 m (with gas collectors up to 60 m) and inner diameter of 6 – 14 m
with walls of refractory brick (Blast furnace metallurgy, 2020). The main function of
the furnace is to continuously produce liquid iron with a desired composition and
temperature. The blast furnace is charged with pellets, scrap metal, coke, briquettes
and slag formers from the furnace top. In the furnace, the raw materials descend while
being dried and heated by the ascending gases. The heated air ignites the coke, forming
CO, which upon its ascent reduces the iron oxides. This reduction occurs in different
temperature zones, so that the oxides are reduced stepwise for hematite to magnetite,
magnetite to wustite and finally wustite to metallic iron (Seetharaman S., 2014a).
These reactions can be simplified in the net reaction
Fe2 O3 (s) + 3CO(g) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2 (g)

(2.1)

9

In the lower part of the furnace, the CO2 formed in the above reactions is regenerated
to CO as it passes through the coke according to the Boudouard (“solution loss”)
reaction
C(s) + CO2 (g) → 2CO(g)

(2.2)

The produced hot metal, also called pig iron, with a composition of approximately 94
– 95% metallic iron (Fe), 4 – 5% carbon (C) and 0.2 – 0.8% silicon (Si), is tapped from
tapholes at the bottom of the furnace (Peacey & Davenport, 1979). In 2018, the
furnaces in Raahe produced approximately 2.5 million tons of hot metal. The melted
iron is then transported in ladles to the steel plant to be converted to steel in the basic
oxygen furnace (BOF). In addition to the production of iron, a blast furnace produces
more than 200 kg of slag per ton iron, consisting of mostly unreduced oxides
(Brännbacka & Saxén, 2001). Another by-product of the hot metal production is blast
furnace gas (BFG), which is a gas with a high carbon monoxide content. This gas is
used as a fuel in different parts of the steelworks: in cowpers for preheating the blast,
coke plant (battery 2) and the power plant boilers. Even though the heating value of
BFG is low (typically about 3 MJ/Nm3), it is produced continuously in large quantities,
making it a very valuable resource in other parts of the steelworks.

Figure 5: Blast furnace zones (Geerdes et al. 2015).

2.2.4 Pulverised coal injection (PCI)
The objective of the pulverized coal injection is to utilize non-coking coal in the blast
furnace. Due to economic reasons and the increase in global coke demand, the
introduction of coal injection has been a way to partially replace coke and to lower the
cost of hot metal production (Geerdes et al., 2015, p. 59).
Other injectants are also used in hot metal production; systems with oil and natural gas
injection have been implemented. The versatile use of injectants is due to the high
temperature in the raceway, where the injectants convert to carbon monoxide and
hydrogen: the reduction processes inside the furnace are not dependent on the source
of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The pulverized coal is injected together with
oxygen-enriched blast through the tuyeres (Geerdes et al., 2015). At the Raahe
steelworks, the coal injection is approximately 150 kg pulverized coal per ton hot
metal.

After the blast furnace, the molten iron is tapped into ladles and subjected to primary
desulphurization and then transported to the steel plant, where it is converted to steel
in a stepwise process. In addition to the molten iron, the steel plant can also mix
recycled scrap metal from the rolling mills and external sources. At the Raahe
steelworks, the conversion process is carried out by utilizing two units, namely the
basic oxygen furnace (or LD converter) and the ladle furnace. The molten steel is
finally cast into slabs. Figure 6 illustrates a schematic of the steelmaking process from
the converters to the casting.

11

Figure 6: Steelmaking process from converter to continuous casting (Seetharaman,
2014a).

2.3.1 Converter
The conversion of carbon-rich hot metal to low-carbon steel is carried out in a
converter. This is done by blowing oxygen at a high pressure (minimum of 16 bar) and
supersonic speed into the converter through a lance in periods lasting 15 – 20 min. By
doing this the excess carbon (4 – 5%) of the hot metal can be reduced to values below
0.1%. This process also removes other impurities, such as sulphur (S), phosphorus (P)
and silicon (Si) (Seetharaman, 2014a). At Raahe about 20% of the converter charge is
scrap metal, but according to literature, a ratio of up to 50% can be reached with good
heat economy (Michaelis, 1979). The converter batch size used in Raahe is 125 tons
(SSAB Raahe data, 2020).
Depending on the produced quality of the steel, different ferroalloys can also be added
to the mix, e.g., chromium (Fe-Cr), manganese (Fe-Mn), niobium (Fe-Nb) and
vanadium (Fe-V). After this, the molten steel goes through secondary refining, e.g.,
desulfurization, dephosphorization, degassing and decarbonization, which are either
done in the converter or a ladle furnace (Seetharaman, 2014a).

12

2.3.2 Ladle furnace and Casting
In Raahe, before being cast to slabs, the molten steel is further refined in the ladle
furnace by, e.g., the adding of ferroalloys. This furnace has also the objective of
temporarily holding and heating the steel, while relieving pressure on the continuous
casting process if this is operating on a previous batch of steel. After the furnace, the
molten steel has the desired composition, temperature and cleanliness that needs to be
maintained. Finally, this molten steel is processed to a semi-finished casting product
called slab by continuous casting. Alternatively, the steel can also be casted into ingots
(Seetharaman, 2014a; Simmons, 2020).

2.4 Rolling mills
After the casting process, the steel slabs are processed into rolled products at the rolling
mill. At Raahe there are two different production lines: a hot strip mill and a plate mill.
The products of the strip mill are thin and rolled into coils, while those of the plate mill
are thick (> 5 mm) metal sheets. The strip mill represents 75% of the total production.
Rolling is a metal-forming process in which the metal, i.e., slabs, are vertically passed
through one or several pairs of rolls and flattened as a result of this; the operation
reduces the thickness and makes the worked metal uniform (Wusatowski, 1969).
Raahe Steelworks uses a process called hot rolling, which comes from the high
temperature of the processed slabs. Before the slabs are rolled, they undergo preheating in specialized ovens (Figure 7) that burn COG and NG as a heat source. The
strip mill operates two walking beam-type furnaces (AP furnace) with different heating
zones that burn COG and NG (COG and LPG was used previously), whereas the plate
mill operates two pusher-type slab reheating furnaces that only burns COG. In
addition, the plate mill also operates heat-treatment furnaces with the choice of fuel
being COG. Heat from these processes are recovered in heat recovery boilers,
producing 8 bar low-pressure (LP) steam used as process steam.

13

Figure 7: AP furnace with heating zones for COG (green) and LNG (orange) (SSAB,
2018).

The strip mill in Raahe is a part of the company’s interplant production as a large part
of the coils are transported to SSAB Hämeenlinna cold rolling plant and the remaining
coils are, e.g., sold to external customers. The production of the strip mill is fast
compared to the plate mill, as a slab is continuously worked on while it is cooled with
a water-cooling system. Plates are rolled, heat-treated and cooled in the cooling banks
before they are mechanically cut, or flame cut.

2.5 Power plant
The processes in the steelworks require both fuel for combustion and electricity. In the
SSAB Raahe plant, most of the electricity consumption is covered by the power plant
and the remaining electricity is bought from the grid. The power plant uses boilerbased energy generation, i.e., combustion of fuels in order to produce heat for highpressure (HP) steam. The description in this part of the thesis will for the most part
follow Kinnunen & Swanljung (2015) on the modernization of the power plant in
Raahe. In the autumn of 2016, the new boiler K5 and generator TG05 started their

14

operation in the power plant. Figure 8 illustrates the structure of the current power
plant.

Figure 8: Layout of the power plant (Kinnunen & Swanljung, 2015).

2.5.1 Boilers
High pressure steam (525 C, 82 bar) is produced by three boilers K3 (which is
currently out of use), K4 and the newest K5 with nominal thermal capacities of 167
MWth, 127 MWth and 152 MWth respectively, as well as the combined steam capacity
(40 MW) of the CDQ unit of the coke plant that produces around 14 kg/s HP steam to
the power plant. The new K5 is optimized to produce approximately 53 kg/s HP steam.
The boilers primarily combust BFG and COG. NG and light fuel oil are combusted in
emergency cases as auxiliary fuels whenever the primary fuel feed is not enough to
supply the minimum steam load. Previously, heavy fuel oil was also used. COG is
typically combusted whenever there is a maintenance stoppage at the rolling mills,
whereas the auxiliary fuels are typically used in order to meet the minimum capacity
15

of the power plant (fuel power) during stoppages of either of the blast furnaces. Figure
9 illustrates the composition of the fuel feed into the power plant during a typical week.
The consumption of COG fluctuates depending on what the consumption is in the other
parts of the steelworks. The feed is typically higher whenever the mills are lowering
their consumption (e.g., at short repairs) and lower when the production is high. The
availability of BFG depends on the blast furnace operations, e.g., if the furnaces are in
operation or if one of them is undergoing short repairs.

Figure 9: Fuel distribution of the power plant (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

Most of the fuel requirements are met with BFG and COG, but whenever there is less
BFG or COG available, the power plant will combust auxiliary fuels. The new K5 has
a flue gas recirculation blower (FGR) for lowering NOX generation; some of the flue
gas is circulated from the stack to the combustion air mixture before being blown back
into the boiler. FGR is additionally required in boilers that are designed for lowcalorific value gas combustion and are operated periodically with LNG or oil to
maintain superheated steam temperature during low load operation with rich fuels.
Excess BFG and COG to the power plant that cannot be burned are stored in gas
holders; there are two of these with capacities of 30 000 m3 and 25 000 m3,
respectively. The holders are used primarily as a buffer for the gases and not
specifically as storage: especially in the case of BFG. This is due to the quantity and
16

nature of production; continuous production also implies a constant production of the
by-product gases. Typical gas-holder level fluctuations are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10: Gasholder levels during a typical week (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

2.5.2 Turbines
A turbine extracts thermal energy from the pressurized steam and converts this energy
to mechanical work by turning a rotating shaft. This shaft is connected to a generator
that further converts the mechanical work to electrical power. The high-pressure steam
is led through two turbines, TG02 (in reserve) and the new TG05 with nominal
capacities of 65 MWe and 110 MWe, respectively. The TG05 turbine (cf. Figure 11)
has two sections for tapping of high- and low-pressure steam. The tapping of steam (8
bar and 10 bar) is optimized to generate the process steam for the steelworks and the
district heat requirement (40 MW). According to Kinnunen & Swanljung (2015), the
district heat pipeline to Raahe city limits this amount. Process steam is also generated
by the recovery boilers in the rolling mills and from the high-pressure reduction valves
of the power plant.

17

Figure 11: Schematics showing steam turbine TG05 (based on Kinnunen and
Swanljung, 2015).

2.5.3 Steam system and district heating
Steam is used at different locations around the plant. The HP steam from the boilers
and CDQ unit is prioritised so that the steam requirements of the steelworks are first
met, such as the degassing process of the steel plant (with 10 bar steam from direct
reduction of HP steam and the steam outlets of the turbine). The remaining HP steam
is led to the turbines TG02 and TG05. The turbines need to receive a minimum load
of steam in order to operate reliably; capacity ranges for TG02 and TG05 are 35-70
kg/s and 40-110 kg/s respectively. Operation under the minimum load will lead to a
higher rate of erosion on the turbine blades and steam nozzles.
District heat is primarily extracted from the cooling water system of the steel plant,
but it is also possible to gain additional heat from condensing the outlet steam from
the turbines if this is not enough. As a last step, heat can be retracted by condensing
steam from the reduction valves prior to the turbines. Figure 12 illustrates the steam
system and steam flows.

18

Figure 12: Steam system of the steelworks (own illustration).

2.6 Air separation units (ASUs)
Oxygen has a crucial role in the steelmaking process, as the production of both iron
and steel consume large amounts of oxygen. As was mentioned previously, the blast
is oxygen enriched, preheated and blown into the blast furnace, and carbon is oxidized
in the molten steel by blowing oxygen into the converter. In addition, oxygen is needed
for different oxygen cutters. In Raahe, there are three air separation units, ASU3,
ASU4 and ASU5, with a combined oxygen production of approximately 53 600
Nm3/h.
The on-site production is carried out by cryogenic separation, i.e., by cooling air until
it liquefies so that the components can be separated by distillation into nitrogen,
oxygen, argon, etc. The refrigeration, which is realized by compression and expansion,
requires a great deal of electrical power. The ASU units consume 190 – 210 GWh/a of
electrical energy (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

19

2.7 Lime kilns
The two lime kilns at Raahe are operated by the company Nordkalk. A lime kiln is a
thermally insulated chamber for burning limestone into quicklime. Quicklime is then
pressed into briquettes that are, e.g., used in the blast furnace (Nordkalk, 2020). The
calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to quicklime (calcium oxide), occurs at a
temperature range of 900 – 1000 C according to
CaCO3 (s) → CaO(s) + CO2 (g)

(2.3)

which is a strongly endothermic reaction. At Raahe, the required heat is generated by
burning COG from the coke plant. Quicklime is also used in steelmaking as a slagging
material, and can also be used at other locations: as a desulphuring agent, for the
coating of pig iron casting moulds, neutralizing of acidic water, wastewater treatment,
flue gas treatment etc.

3. Energy and emissions statistics in Raahe Steelworks in 2019
The year 2019 saw some changes in the energy consumption of the steelworks. In
addition, the year was exceptional when it came to the availability of BFG. In January
2019, one of the blast furnaces experienced a major disturbance that led to a complete
stop of production and sequentially to a 2-month long overhaul of the furnace. During
this time there was only one blast furnace that produced hot metal iron and the byproduct BFG, leading to an increase in the combustion of auxiliary fuel at the power
plant. In 2019, the strip mill’s (AP) heating furnaces were converted to use LNG as
the heat source. Figure 13 shows the process gas and energy streams in the Raahe
steelworks for 2019.

Figure 13: Process gas streams at Raahe Steelworks in 2019. Please note that the
proportion of purchased electricity is wrong, as it is approximately 335 GWh (SSAB
Raahe data, 2020).

21

In 2019, the production quantities of crude steel and steel slabs amounted to 1982 kt
and 1952 kt. For most part the fuel consumption was covered by the by-product gases
from the blast furnaces and the coking plant, but certain quantities of LPG, light fuel
oil and LNG were used at various locations in the steelworks. The power plant used
LNG and fuel oil whenever the primary fuel supply (BFG and COG) was insufficient
to satisfy up the minimum fuel power requirement of the boilers. At the steelworks,
there are several areas that use considerable amounts of electricity, e.g., blast furnace
blowers, air separation units, rolling mills, steel plant and power plant accounting for
approximately 80% of the total consumption, with the ASUs alone consuming
approximately 22%. On average, up to 72% of the steelwork’s yearly electricity
consumption was covered by the own power production (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).
Figure 14 shows the total energy balances of the site with production quantities.

Figure 14: Production and energy data for year 2019 (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

The total CO2 emissions of steelworks were 3 314 kt. As for emissions allowances, the
number of acquired permits was approximately 3 387 kt, leading to an allowance
surplus of 73 kt CO2 (Figure 15). In these calculations, the units producing by-product

22

gases, i.e., the blast furnaces and the coke plant, have received some compensation for,
e.g., the process gases, which lowers the amount of CO2 that must be considered at
these specific locations. After these reductions, the units with the largest individual
CO2 emissions are the blast furnaces and the power plant, which jointly amount to
approximately 70% of the total emissions (SSAB Raahe data, 2020). For purchased
electricity, the average emissions estimate for 2019 was 91 kg CO2/MWh (Fingrid,
2020).

Figure 15: Estimated and realized CO2 emissions during the year 2019 (SSAB Raahe
data).

In the case of hot metal production, the fuel and energy consumptions are considerable.
Emissions for hot metal production were approximately 33% of the total emissions of
the steelworks (approximately 1.1 Megatons CO2). When examining individual
emissions sources in the hot metal production, coking coal and injected coal amounted
to approximately 74%, or 0.814 Megatons. According to on-site expert, the calculated
CO2 emissions are dependent on the method used; emissions can be calculated as the
amount of oxidized carbon or by purely looking at enthalpies. Raahe Steelworks uses
a mass-balance method, in which it is possible to monitor both positive and negative
streams.

23

4. Fuel analysis
The choice of fuel has a significant effect on the CO2 emissions because of the fuelspecific carbon content. When a hydrocarbon burns, it is oxidised, releasing energy in
the form of heat, sparks and light (Kondratiev, 2020). For a hydrocarbon, the chemical
equation for stoichiometric combustion is:
𝑦

𝑦

C𝑥 H𝑦 + (𝑥 + 4)O2 (g) → 𝑥CO2 (g) + 2 H2 O (g)

(4.1)

The number of carbon dioxide molecules is dependent on the number of carbon atoms
in the selected fuel; a fuel with a shorter carbon chain-length gives a lower proportion
of CO2. If the benefits of a certain fuel type in relation to emissions needs to be
determined, it is important to observe some fuel-specific values, such as the heating
value, purchasing price and the carbon content (Luh et al., 2018). Furthermore,
emission criteria and the practise of emissions trading are some of the other reasons
why the choice of fuel should be made with environmental aspects in mind.
It is also worth noting that in many cases the combustion of fuels does not occur in
one seating. A fuel may combust in a series of reactions if there is not enough oxygen
for the total reaction. For instance, a carbon monoxide (CO) gas may be formed, which
can be further oxidised in downstream processes. This is the case for BFG, which is
used as a fuel in the power and coke plant (and cowpers). These stepwise reactions
ultimately lead to reaction 4.1 (Kondratiev, 2020).

4.1 Choice of fuel
Fuel switching has had a positive effect on reducing global emissions in the energy
sector (IEA, 2020). However, a switching of fuels in different industrial units may
require different infrastructure, storage units and other modifications of existing
processes and practices. These aspects naturally affect the choice of fuel, especially
when it comes to overall investments and costs associated with process conversion.
The thesis will mostly concentrate on the emissions aspects and will not consider the
24

economy, e.g., when it comes to investments on piping or other costs associated with
implementation. Therefore, switching fuels to other less emitting alternatives, like
LNG, will not necessarily be the cheapest alternative in the short term, because of the
implementation costs. However, the potential use of LNG in reducing emissions at
Raahe steelworks will be studied here. Thus, the use of some fuels that are currently
in use at the steelworks will be scrutinized in more detail; these are the BFG, COG,
heavy and light fuel oils, LPG and LNG (SSAB Raahe data, 2020). These are presented
in Table 3 with approximate values for CO2 conversion and heating values from the
steelworks data.
Table 3: Carbon content and heating values for different fuels at Raahe Steelworks.

The CO2 conversion and heating values of different fuels give ample information about
the combusted fuel. For each fuel it is possible to identify how much of it is needed if
the energy requirement is known. Also, by using the heating value and the value for
CO2 conversion, it is possible to calculate a CO2/MWh ratio for the fuel, called the
emission (or carbon) intensity, I. The intensity for the fuels in Table 3 are presented in
Table 4.

With regards to the values in Table 4, it can be stated that it is beneficial to replace
almost all other fuels with LNG as far as emission intensity is considered; especially
the combustion of BFG results in a considerable emission of CO2: the gas has a low
heating value but is produced in large quantities. Thus, the BFG has a significant effect
on the total emissions of the steelworks.
The fuel with the lowest emission intensity is COG. However, this gas is a by-product
gas from coke production and has gone through treatment for the removal of volatile
compounds, which should be considered. Also, excess BFG and COG cannot be fully
stored in gas holders. Therefore, they need to be used in the plant; gases that cannot be
used at the steelworks are flared when the holder capacity is reached and are then
completely wasted.

4.2 Purchasing and taxation
The BFG and COG that are produced during normal production are for the most part
combusted at the steelworks for different purposes. Still, these fuels do not cover the
total fuel demand and the resulting deficit is covered by fuels that are acquired from
external sources. For these fuels, the purchasing price is a combination of the costs for
extraction, refining, distributor’s margin as well as different taxes on import,
production, transport and CO2 emissions (Trinomics. 2018). Table 5 reports some
selected fuels with wholesale prices in EU in 2018. These are given with a range of 
5 € in order to account for fluctuations.

According to the Finnish tax administration (fi. Verohallinto), an industrially used fuel
(such as liquid fuels, coal and natural gas) is exempted from excise taxation and is free
of the strategic stockpile fee if the fuel is directly used in the production of the end
product, or as a raw material or auxiliary agent (Verohallinto, 2019a). Thus, the fuel
needs to be irreplaceable to produce the end product. There is a practical advantage to
planning the fuel consumption strategically in order to lower certain taxes during
production.
There are several aspects of taxation that will not be discussed here. However, for the
matter of reducing CO2 emissions, the carbon dioxide tax will be considered at some
detail. Table 6 presents fuel-specific CO2 taxes in Finland:
Table 6: Reported CO2 taxes for the selected fuels (Verohallinto, 2019b)
Fuel type
CO2 tax [€/MWh]
Heavy fuel oil
18.20
Light fuel oil
17.71
LPG
13.30
LNG
12.94
Of the reported fuels in Table 6, LNG has the lowest carbon content and the lowest
carbon dioxide tax. Fuels with higher conversion rates may be cheaper for the time
being, but if the emissions tax increases (which is expected in the future), the use of
low-emission alternatives may become economically beneficial (Verohallinto, 2019).

4.3 Emissions trading
The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the corner stone in EU’s fight against
climate change (European Commission. 2015). The basic idea of the system is to costeffectively limit the total greenhouse gas emissions by issuing caps on industrial
installations. A cap limits the total amount of emissions that an energy-using
installation can emit; with time this cap is reduced which leads to lower total
emissions. Companies operating under the system can buy and receive emissions
allowances and trade these with one another (Figure 16). Also, projects aimed at
lowering atmospheric CO2 content can be used to acquire “international credit”. This
27

credit can be used, e.g., for covering the company’s emissions in Europe. These credits
are generated and managed according to the agreements in the Kyoto Protocol
(UNFCCC, 2020). A cap is determined by the best available techniques (BAT) for the
industry section in question, so limits are set according to the most energy-efficient
and least emitting techniques that can be used in industrial scale. In January 2020, the
price of emission allowance per ton carbon dioxide was 23 – 26 € in the EU (Markets
Insider, 2020), but along with the COVID-19 pandemic it dropped, to recover to the
same level (in November 2020). This allowance is expected to increase further in the
future (European Commission, 2015; Boersen & Scholtens, 2014).

Figure 16: Simple illustration of the emissions trading (based on VU, 2017)
The trade system enforces its rules by fining companies that fail to present the required
emissions allowances. A company can save its credits and allowances for the future if
it can reduce its yearly emissions from what it has the permits for. Alternatively, it can
also sell spare allowances to other companies that need to cover their excess emissions.
As companies can both trade and save their allowances, the system is flexible
(European Commission, 2015).
Greenhouse gases that are controlled by the system are easy to measure, calculate and
verify, including emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxides (N2O) and
perfluorocarbons (PFC). Especially companies in the energy-intensive production
28

sector, such as iron- and steelmaking companies, emit considerable amounts of CO2.
Emissions that surpass the prior mentioned cap, will lead to additional expenses for
the companies in the form of purchasing CO2 allowances (European Commission.
2015).
Considering the above factors, the use of LNG is a plausible alternative in the
steelworks; the fuel-specific carbon content, emission intensity and heating value
make it competitive with the other fuels. The lower emission intensity is also a factor
that lowers the expenses for acquiring additional emissions allowances. However, the
compatibility of using LNG in the processes should be first clarified. For combustion,
it should be determined whether the ratio of oxygen in the combustion air needs to be
altered or if modifications need to be made, e.g., to the fuel feed nozzles.
For further lowering emissions, Bio-LNG (biomethane or biogas) is a possible
alternative in the future. According to a report by European Commission (2016),
biogas is considered to have no emissions if it is used for energy production, e.g., in a
power plant. For heavy industry, such as steelworks, fuel requirements are
considerable. Supplying enough Bio-LNG, for the hot metal production would be
demanding because of the current production capacity in Finland. Therefore, LNG is
considered here, but Bio-LNG is presented as a possible alternative in the future.
Furthermore, most of the findings concerning the performance of LNG can be directly
used to assess the future use of Bio-LNG.

5. Natural gas in hot metal production
The reduction process in the blast furnace occurs through two processes, which are
called the direct and indirect reduction (Seetharaman, 2014a; Geerdes et al., 2015a).
In direct reduction, iron ore is reduced with the help of solid carbon in coke, whereas
in indirect (or gas) reduction the carbon is indirectly responsible for the reduction of
iron ore since carbon monoxide acts as the reducer. The direct reduction consumes
considerable amounts of energy in the lower part of the furnace where coke and the
burden are heated up to their final temperatures and the latter is melted (Geerdes et al.,
2015, p. 60). The heat is supplied by the coke and the injectants (typically pulverized
coal).
The furnace temperature profile is important for operating the furnace properly;
temperatures are constantly monitored for the best possible efficiency. The gas
reduction consumes considerably less energy than the direct reduction, so it should be
promoted, which can be done by maintaining appropriate conditions in the dry part
(stack or shaft) of the furnace. If the reduction reactions are shifted more towards gas
reduction, the furnace can be operated more efficiently with lower heat requirements,
i.e., with lower coke rates. A lower coke rate can also be obtained by injecting coal
and other hydrocarbons. Still, coke is needed for maintaining the required porous
structure of the bed in the upper and lower furnace and to supply carbon to the hot
metal. In practice, a portion of the reduction reactions will always take place through
direct reduction. The portion of direct reduction is approximately 35% in modern blast
furnaces (Li et al., 2007), but the lower limit has been estimated to be at least 20% for
conventional operation of the blast furnace (Cavaliere, 2019, p. 178).
If NG is injected, hydrogen takes up the major role as reducing agent at the expense of
CO in the gas reduction; adding hydrogen increases its share of gas reduction, which
may shift the reduction process away from direct reduction. In this way, the furnace
consumes less energy as more iron is reduced indirectly by the ascending gases. This
makes it possible for the furnace to operate at a lower flame temperature and at a lower
coke rate (Geerdes et al., 2015, p. 71; Seetharaman 2014a). However, the hydrogen

30

reduction reactions are endothermic so a large injection of hydrogen-bearing gases
may change the thermal profile, which can also have detrimental effects on the
reduction efficiency. Thus, plant trials are needed to confirm the expected behaviour.
Globally, blast furnaces have been constructed in different sizes and, e.g., with
different injection systems. For instance, the furnaces at AK Steel Middletown have
applied an NG injection rate of up to 117 kg/thm. Globally, however, the injection
rates have most frequently been in the range of 60 – 90 kg/thm but rates of up to 150
kg/thm have been reported (Geerdes et al. 2015b; Cavaliere, 2019).
Even though the carbon in coke has traditionally been the primary reducing agent for
iron oxides, lately a hot topic in ironmaking has been to find means to lower the CO2
emissions. This is one of the reasons for introducing new injectants, besides lowering
the overall consumption of coke. Thus, when comparing injectants, there is a desire to
use injectants with lower carbon/hydrogen ratios, like natural gas (Seetharaman,
2014b). As LNG is injected after gasifying it, the concepts of LNG and NG use are
equivalent here. Figure 17 depicts schematically the tuyere, raceway and feed of PC,
NG and blast.

Figure 17: Schematics of the raceway area and tuyere with blast, PC and NG supply
(based on Okosun et al., 2016).

31

5.1 Natural gas injection
Injecting hydrogen works to partly take up the role of reducing agent at the expense of
carbon in CO. NG has several advantages compared to PC; it has lower ash, sulphur
and alkali contents (Geerdes, 2016). When NG comes into contact with oxygen in the
combustion zone, raceway, which is located in front of the tuyeres, the resulting gas
combustion also effectively increases the temperature of the injected PC, leading to an
improved initial combustion of the latter. However, as the combustion of NG is
incomplete (to CO) and the hydrogen will form H2 gas, less heat is generated at
combustion compared to combustion of coal, while the volume of (the so-called bosh)
gas is increased in the tuyere region (Geerdes, 2016). Above the raceways, some of
the hydrogen molecules react with the oxygen and form water vapour, which may react
with coke. This strongly endothermic reaction
C(s) + H2 O(g) → CO(g) + H2 (g)

(5.1)

may also occur in the raceway and serves as a heat sink. In cases where the hydrogen
content of the gas in the furnace increases significantly, it is important to account for
the change in the furnace’s temperature profile by increasing the oxygen enrichment
of the blast. However, the blast oxygen content is limited by the fact that an increase
in oxygen simultaneously reduces the nitrogen content of the blast, which leads to
smaller quantities of gas in the furnace and consequently a drop in the top gas
temperature. A low top gas temperature (e.g., < 100 C) may lead to a too sluggish
heating of the burden in the upper furnace, which delays the start of the reduction
reactions in the shaft: this, in turn, lowers the shaft efficiency (Seetharaman, 2014b).
Also, structural factors limit the injection rate; the furnace needs a minimum amount
of coke for supporting burden and for providing a decent distribution of the gas in the
shaft and cohesive zone. This distribution is important for production optimization; the
burden layers should have a sufficient permeability (for liquids and gases) so that here
is a good exchange of heat and mass between the gas and the condensed phases. This
factor also limits the injection of PC.
32

The temperature profile of the furnace is vital for operating it efficiently. For this
purpose, the flame, top gas temperatures and in-burden/above burden probe
temperatures are observed carefully; the flame temperature ultimately reflects the
supply of thermal energy, and the top gas temperature the heat supplied to the burden
in the upper part. Should the top gas temperature be below the dew point, water will
start to condense in the upper parts of the furnace, which consequently increases the
time for burden drying, as less gas is available for heating (Geerdes et al., 2015a). The
“quenching” effect of NG injection can be tackled by changing the blast parameters
such as, the blast temperature and oxygen content. Okosun et al. (2020) observed that
increasing NG temperature could be a valid alternative for countering the effects of
increased NG injection; pre-heating by 600 K was studied (from ambient temperature
of 300K), but the most promising results were obtained for pre-heating by 300 K. In
this case, it was possible to counteract the cooling effect of a 15% increase in NG
injection while at the same time reducing coke consumption by approximately 6.3%.
In their experiment, the initial coke rate was 392 kg/thm and the NG and PC injection
rates were 65 kg/thm and 85 kg/thm, respectively. However, depending on the size of
the furnace and the injection rate, the adiabatic flame temperature should be at least
1900 C and the top gas temperature above 100 C for the blast furnace to operate
smoothly (Cavaliere, 2016).
The decreasing effect of NG on the flame temperature is larger than for other
injectants, such as coal, oil or tar. This decrease in temperature is still manageable
when operating the furnace, as adding H2 decreases direct reduction and increases gas
reduction (Geerdes et al., 2015, p.71). In comparison, blast furnaces that inject PC can
operate at a flame temperature range of approximately 2050 – 2200 ºC, whereas
furnaces with NG injection can potentially be operated at temperatures below 1900 C
(Geerdes et al., 2015b). The portion of direct reduction can be decreased only to a limit
by adding H2 to reducing gas. Li et al. (2007) notes that the H2 content could be as high
as 50% for it to still decrease the portion of direct reduction. After this point, adding
more H2 did not have an effect on reduction, but instead decreased the utilization

33

efficiency of H2; a favourable content for reducing wüstite was proposed to be 15 –
30% (Li et al., 2007).
In the wüstite reduction zone, H2 is an effective oxygen carrier from the solid phase to
the gas phase (Cavaliere, 2019, p. 178). However, Kemppainen et al. (2012) noted that
a significant increase in H2O concentration in the furnace shaft has also other effects
in this area, for instance through the water-gas shift reaction (WGSR)
kj

o
CO(g) + H2 O(g) ↔ CO2 (g) + H2 (g), ∆H298K
= −41.09 mol

(5.2)

The favourable temperature range for the reaction is 800 – 1000 C with the typical
catalyst being magnetite, Fe3O4. At temperatures below 800 C, the equilibrium
constant is less than unity, so the reaction is shifted to the left, which decreases the CO
utilization (𝜂CO ) but increases the H2 utilization (𝜂H2 ) (Geerdes et al., 2015, p. 112).
This has to be kept in mind when the top gas analysis is studied, and the reaction also
has implications for the later utilization of BFG. WGSR can lead to a misinterpretation
of the calculated H2 utilization, as it is not clear whether H2 or CO was primarily
responsible for the reduction of the iron oxides. It be noted is that, from an equilibrium
point of view, the efficiency of iron oxide reduction by H2 is lower than it is for CO at
temperatures below 800 C (Kemppainen, 2015; Geerdes et al., 2015a).
In gas reduction, the two main components are H2 and CO, which compete over the
reduction of iron oxides. These reductions are, however, dependent on the injectant
rates; the addition of hydrogen (in NG) increases the hydrogen content of the gas.
Figure 18 shows the equilibrium diagrams for iron oxide in different H 2/H2O and
CO/CO2 gas atmospheres and the Boudouard reaction.

34

Figure 18: Equilibrium curves for iron oxides in the atmospheres of H2/H2O and
CO/CO2 (Biswas, 1981).

From the figure, it is possible to identify the temperature ranges where the equilibrium
for hydrogen reduction is more favourable than the equilibrium for CO reduction.
Reduction in H2/H2O atmosphere at higher temperatures (> 810 C) is more efficient
than in the CO/CO2 atmosphere. This can be observed in both the lower and the upper
parts of the furnace, reducing both Fe3O4 and FeO (Geerdes et al., 2015a). On the other
hand, the temperature profiles in the blast furnace often speak against a high
temperature for the regions where hematite is reduced.

5.2 Natural gas as PC conveyer gas
In the PC injection system, a conveyer gas transports the coal particles into the furnace.
As the PC lance experiences wear caused by the excessive heat in the area, it is also
important to cool the lance; the coolant can be, e.g., oxygen, air or methane (Shen et
al., 2009). The type of injection system varies from furnace to furnace. Raahe
steelworks uses an injection system with a PC-to-gas mass ratio of 30:1. Nitrogen is
currently being used as both the conveyer gas and coolant (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

35

As the injectants enter the tuyere they come into contact with the blast, which leads to
a combustion. The blast is blown into the furnace through the blowpipe where the
injectant lance/lances enter. A combination of NG as a conveyer gas and injectant has
been shown to enhance coal burnout in the raceway (Majeski et al., 2015). Of the
studied lance constructions, the authors concluded that it specifically was the
combined-lance design (PC and NG) that led to an improved combustion PC. Also, for
the best cooling effect on the lance walls, the cooling NG had an annular flow.
However, Shen et al. (2009) remarked that the cooling effect of oxygen outweighed
that of air or methane when looking at coal devolatilization, as the devolatilization was
strongly dependent on the availability of oxygen.
When it came to the use of NG as a conveyer gas for PC, Okosun et al. (2016) noted
that this combination rapidly increased the temperature of both the gas and PC in the
tuyere region; coal is heated up more rapidly around the injection area leading to a
greatly enhanced devolatilization. However, there were some concerns about the
temperature profile of the tuyere area that were the result of the improved combustion.
If the combustion occurred too rapidly, there was a possibility of thermal wear on the
tuyere and lance configurations, as well as a possibility of causing a pressure drop in
the tuyere region (Helle & Saxen, 2006). However, Okosun et al. (2016) concluded
that a possible way of lowering thermal wear on the tuyere-lance configuration is to
reduce the blast flow rate. However, this would obviously decrease the production rate.
A lower blast rate reduced the heat convection between the blast and blow pipe as well
as the tuyere and lance walls. It was also observed that the combustion of NG in the
tuyeres did not significantly change by the reduced flow rate (Okosun et al., 2016).

36

6. Modelling
In order to study the effect of injecting gasified LNG in the blast furnace, a flowsheet
model that considers the production units of the steelworks implemented in MATLAB
(MathWorks Inc) will be used (Helle et al., 2011). For the calculation, the model was
adapted to the overall data of the steelworks in question. For instance, in 2019 the
production rate was typically around 260 t/h. The model equations are computationally
solved by minimizing the CO2 emissions, which will usually give the solution with
minimum coke rate under the given constraints.
This section will present the model mass balances, such as the main production
processes and by-product gas production and consumption. The equations for the
electricity and district heat consumptions of individual production units are not
presented here, but they are used in the model and the results are presented later. The
different smaller areas of interest where LPG is currently used, such as scrap cutting
and machine planer, are observed in the model. Primary fuels that will be studied are
the by-product gases (BFG and COG), heating oil, PC, LPG and LNG (where heating
oil and LNG are used as auxiliary fuels at the power plant).
With the model, it is also possible to test different setups for the system such as fuel
options in order to optimize COG consumption. The consumption should be optimized
so that the production of the rolling mills (pre-heating and heat-treatment furnaces)
will not be affected by gas shortages. The model estimates the CO2 emissions per ton
crude steel, 𝑚CO2,tcs by
44

(6.1)

In the equation, 𝑋𝐶,𝑖 is the mass fraction of carbon for the component 𝑖 and the carbon
fractions of all coke used in production is assumed to be the same. 𝐸el,purch is the

37

purchased electricity and the term where it appears considers the indirect effects (on
the steelworks emissions) with the national average of 91 kg CO2/MWh (Fingrid,
2020). Figure 19 illustrates the modelled system with in- and outflows. The blast
furnace is charged with coke, pellets and limestone at the top while the injectants and
blast are blown into the furnace in the lower part. Top gas (BFG) is collected at the
furnace top and molten metal and slag through tap holes at the lower parts of the
furnace.

Figure 19: Modelled system with process in- and outflows (based on Helle et al.,
2011).

6.1 Model operation principle
The studied model system is an integrated steelworks with blast furnaces, cowpers,
converter, rolling mills, power plant, briquetting plant, lime kilns and coke plant. For
these units, a series of mass and energy balances dictate how the units react to changes
in the operation variables; the model functions iteratively by finding the optimal
solution under given variable constraints.

38

The model equations are in this work solved by finding the minimum CO2 emissions
of the integrated system under constraints given by the user. Here, the primary focus
was on the injection of gasified LNG. Starting from PC injection only, the NG injection
rate was gradually increased while the PC rate was decreased. The model calculations
are made by assuming that the steelworks is operated under steady-state conditions.
All emissions in the system are dependent on the input carbon, as all carbon that is
used by the integrated system will eventually come out as CO2, except the carbon in
the steel.
Most emphasise is put on the blast furnaces, as the introduction of NG as an injectant
and PC conveyor gas is one of the main subjects of study in the thesis. As the primary
fuel of choice is coke, a lower consumption is preferable for lowering CO2 emissions.
However, as the raceway is the area where the injectants and the coke burn, the
adiabatic flame temperature is one of the most important constraints in the model.
After combustion, the heat is absorbed by the gas and transported with the ascending
gases, which reduce the iron oxides and heat the descending burden in the furnace.

6.2 Coke plant
The coke-making process is modelled by linear relations between the coal feed and the
produced coke and COG. The coke plant consists of two batteries (1 and 2). Based on
energy data from Raahe, the production of one ton of coke requires 0.95 MWh of COG
and 0.32 MWh of BFG. The required volume flow rates of COG and BFG, denoted by
𝑉̇COG,CP and 𝑉̇BFG,CP, respectively, can thus be expressed

and the net produced volume flow rate of COG as
𝑉̇COG = 𝑣COG ∙ 𝑚̇coke,prod − 𝑉̇COG,CP

(6.4)

At SSAB Raahe the volume of COG produced per ton of coke was approximated to
𝑣COG = 455 Nm3 /t.
As the coke-plant production cannot easily be adjusted, the production rate of coke in
the model was fixed to 𝑚̇coke,prod = 90 t/h. This gives a volume flow rate of COG of
𝑉̇COG,CP ≈ 18.3 kNm3 /h, while the volume flow rate of BFG varies with its heating
value. Depending on the requirement of coke in the steel plant, 𝑚̇coke,req , coke may be
bought or sold. If there is a need for external coke, it is bought according to
𝑚̇coke,buy = 𝑚̇coke,req − 𝑚̇coke,prod. Conversely, it is possible to sell excess coke to
external buyers according to 𝑚̇coke,sell = 𝑚̇coke,prod − 𝑚̇coke,req.

6.3 Blast furnaces
The blast furnace model is based on mass balances and thermodynamics, where the
process is defined with both thermal and chemical equilibriums between the different
zones. The inflow of raw materials (pellets, coke, etc.) and the injectants all contribute
with chemical elements to the process with, e.g., reducing agents primarily coming
from coke and injectants. In the model it was furthermore assumed that the nitrogen
conveyer gas for PC was replaced by NG.
The process variables, such as the adiabatic flame temperature (Tfl), temperatures of
top gas, appear in the constraints within which the model should find the optimal
solution. Selected variables and constraints will be studied later in this chapter. Figure
20 shows the principle of the model.

40

Figure 20: Flows and components in to and out of the blast furnace (based on Helle et
al., 2011).

In the model, the furnace is divided into two main zones, the preparation zone (pz) and
elaboration zone (ez), with a “reserve zone” between them. In this reserve zone, the
temperature of the different compounds is assumed to be practically the same and the
descending iron oxides, in this case mostly wüstite (FeO), are assumed to reach
equilibrium with the ascending gas. The adiabatic flame temperature and bosh gas
volume flow are calculated by assuming that the combustion in front of the tuyeres
occurs in adiabatic conditions (no heat is lost). This temperature is affected by factors
like the blast temperature and oxygen content, and the composition and temperature of
the injectants. With the given hot metal production rate, the molar iron balance for the
furnace is

In equation 6.11, ∆𝑛̇ 𝑂 stands for the flow of released oxygen from iron oxides.
An incomplete combustion of carbon (C + ½ O2 → CO) occurs in the raceways as
there is an excess of carbon in the area. The theoretical flame temperature is calculated
based on the assumption that all carbon, oxygen and water vapour have reacted to
carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and that nitrogen gas has stayed inert.
Injecting carbon in the form of NG and the improved devolatilization of PC may yield
a lower consumption of coke; the introduction of the injectants was firstly an
economical alternative to coke coal. As the blast furnace operation in this model is
used to find an optimal combination of PC and NG, calculations will be made based
on the following basis: the total specific injected quantity is assumed to be constant at
150 kg/thm and the share of PCI, 𝑥PC , is varied to yield
42

𝑚
̃ PC = 𝑥PC ∙ 150

kg

(6.12)

thm

kg

𝑚
̃ NG = (1 − 𝑥PC ) ∙ 150 thm

(6.13)

In these equations, the PC rate is gradually lowered by 2% and the effect on the coke
consumption is determined. Since the amount of hot metal and injectants are given,
the coke consumption is calculated according to minimal carbon requirements for heat
and reduction (i.e., both direct and indirect reductions). For indirect reduction, the
determined coke consumption also provides enough reducing gas so that the portion
of direct reduction is minimal, and the process is efficient.

6.4 Converter
Simplified, the steel plant is modelled to have a converter or basic oxygen furnace
(BOF) where the conversion of molten iron to liquid steel is carried out. In the model,
all additives except scrap metal are neglected and the mass of scrap is assumed to be
25% of the hot metal to the batch (𝑚̇scrap = 0.25𝑚̇hm ), assuming that 1/3 of the scrap
is bought and that all of the scrap metal is pure iron (Fe). Iron losses in both the
converter and continuous casting processes are assumed to be 5%.
With these assumptions it is possible to calculate the amount of molten steel after
conversion and the resulting mass of slabs by using iron and carbon balances. The
conversion ratio, 𝑥ls , from hot metal to liquid steel is given by

𝑥ls = 0.95 ∙

1−𝑋C,hm
1−𝑋C,ls

(6.14)

where 𝑋C,hm and 𝑋C,ls stand for the carbon fractions in hot metal and liquid steel (4.6%
and 0.1%). With this ratio, the functions for the conversion of hot metal (𝑚̇hm ) to mass
of slab is
𝑚̇slab = 0.95 ∙ (𝑥ls 𝑚̇hm + 𝑚̇scrap )

(6.15)
43

6.5 Rolling mills
The rolling mills produces both strip and plate products with combined production
rates of 260 t/h, 290 t/h or 320 t/h, and approximately 75% by the strip mill. The model
considers a constant specific consumption of COG in pre-heating or heat-treatment
ovens, so there is a linear relation between the production of hot rolled products and
the consumption of COG (𝑉̇COG,strip and 𝑉̇COG,plate ). Furthermore, of the total energy
consumption approximately 25% is covered by combusting LNG (predominately in
the slab reheating ovens of the strip mill). Equations for coil and plate production of
the rolling mills, as well as COG and LNG consumptions are expressed as:
𝑚̇roll = 0.94 ∙ 𝑚̇slabs

(6.20)

6.6 Lime kilns
For the purpose of this model, the lime kiln is handled as a production facility with a
constant lime production rate of 15 t/h with a (from data extracted) COG consumption
rate of approximately 3.3 GJ/t, giving a total consumption of 49.50 GJ/h or 2.95
kNm3/h. The production rate of the Lime kilns is assumed to be independent of the hot
rolled production rate.

44

6.7 Power plant
The power plant is modelled as a boiler, a turbine and a generator following the layout
presented in Figure 8, with the K5 boiler, TG05 turbine and generator. The power plant
fuel balance for the boiler (thermal power) consists of the feed of by-product gases and
auxiliary fuel
𝐸̇thrm = 𝐸̇COG,PP + 𝐸̇BFG,PP + 𝐸̇oil + 𝐸̇LNG

(6.21)

with the feed of COG and BFG given as
𝐸̇COG,PP = 𝐸̇COG,cp − 𝐸̇COG,sp − 𝐸̇COG,lk − 𝐸̇COG,roll − 𝐸̇COG,BF

(6.22)

𝐸̇BFG,PP = 𝐸̇BFG,BF − 𝐸̇BFG,cp − 𝐸̇BFG,cow

(6.23)

For the turbine, it is assumed that the feed high-pressure (HP) steam is 525 C and 82
bar (3460 kJ/kg) and the outlet water is 50 C and 0.2 bar (210 kJ/kg) after condensing.
After the turbine HP section, the medium-pressure (MP) steam is at 331 C and 10.7
bar (3120 kJ/kg). From this section the steam is led to the low-pressure (LP) section at
1.25 bar and 108 C (2690 kJ/kg). The steam exiting the LP section is below
atmospheric pressure (vacuum steam) at 0.02 bar and containing approximately 10%
water (2290 kJ/kg), cf. Figure 21.

The steam requirements of the steelworks, 𝑚̇st,req, need to be covered by the generated
steam from the CDQ unit of the coke plant and the power plant. In the power plant,
half of the requirement is covered by direct reduction of HP steam (see eq. 6.28) and
the remaining half by tapping medium-pressure steam (see eq. 6.30). In addition,
45

district heat is obtained from tapping the steam outlet in eq. 6.30; this required amount
of steam is assumed to be equivalent to 60% of the steam requirement (𝑚̇dist =
0.6 ∙ 𝑚̇st,req).

Figure 21: Steam requirements and tapping (own illustration)

Steam requirement can be expressed as
𝑚̇st,req = 𝑚̇st,bf + 𝑚̇st,conv + 𝑚̇st,roll + 𝑚̇st,briq

(6.26)

where HP, MP and LP stand for high pressure, medium pressure and low pressure. The
turbine is connected to a generator that is assumed to have an energy conversion rate
of 95%. Thus, the generated electrical power is given as
(6.32)

𝑃el = 0.95 ∙ (𝑃HP + 𝑃MP + 𝑃LP )

6.8 Model variables and parameters
The model solves the problem by minimizing the CO2 emissions, but the model
variables are constrained by lower and upper bounds in order to obtain a feasible
solution (cf. Table 7). As the blast furnace is the area where a large quantity of energy
is needed and where the LNG is introduced, the simulated production rate and
estimated emissions per ton steel are restricted by furnace-specific constraints. These
constraints can be temperature-related, such as for the adiabatic flame temperature.
This value is controlled by the blast parameters, such as blast temperature, blast
oxygen content and humidity content, as well as the injectant rate. The blast
temperature and oxygen content increase the value, and the blast humidity and
injectant rate decrease it.

The production rates of the coke plant and the lime kilns are fixed (see Table 8). Also,
the temperatures of the blast and the thermal reserve zone are constant. The modelled
blast furnaces are medium-sized, with both of them having the same measurements as
47

BF2 (‘MA2’) in Raahe. As the production rate of coils and plates is assumed to be
fixed, the model will calculate the needed production rate of slabs, molten steel and
hot metal, which will depend linearly on the given hot rolled production rate.

7. Model validation, factors & limitations
Using the mathematical model, it is possible to estimate the emissions for the studied
system under different conditions. The model can yield optimal solutions with respect
to, e.g., costs and coke consumption. In this thesis, however, the model was solved
with regards to the lowest CO2 emissions.
The main point of focus in the model is put on the blast furnace. The first case will be
considered the base-case situation for the steelworks. From this point, changes are
made to the injected quantities by increasing the share of LNG at the expense of PC,
where injecting solely PC is the base case. As the injection rate is gradually changed,
changes of the chemical and energy state of the blast furnace will be brought about,
which will lead to changes in the whole steelworks. The results of these can then be
analysed, e.g., to find an optimal preplacement of PC by LNG.

7.1 Application of the model to steelworks data
For the model to give reliable findings, its results were compared to the data from the
steelworks in 2019 (with a coil and plate production rate of approximately 260 t/h). In
this chapter, the effects of injecting LNG will be studied. In subsequent simulations
(with different production rates), the effect of a blast temperature increases to 1200 C
by using LNG at the cowpers will be studied. In this section, the model cowpers will
only operate with BFG and the blast temperature is fixed to 1120 C, which is the
highest temperature that can be achieved with BFG (SSAB Raahe data, 2020).
At Raahe Steelworks, the year 2019 was exceptional when it came to the unscheduled
production stop that was caused by the sudden rupturing of the blast furnace wall.
When comparing the model base case with the actual data from the steelworks, the
model was found to provide adequate approximations on the productions and
consumption on site (Figure 22).

49

Figure 22: Model base case.

7.2 Calculating optimal emissions
The blast furnace is the process where the injectant is expected to lead to significant
reduction in the total emissions. When injecting NG, the changes in the mass and heat
balances of the furnace will be favourable for the reduction. Variable bounds are
important for calculating the potential, as these, e.g., restrict the operation of the blast
furnace.

7.2.1 Carbon consumption for heat and reduction in the blast furnace
The carbon consumption of the furnace can be described as the combined effect of two
minimum carbon requirements, heat and reduction. The minimum heat consumption
includes the supply and demand of heat in the lower furnace. These in- and outflows
are based on assumptions on approach to chemical equilibrium between the iron oxides
and the reducing agents, e.g., how much energy is required for heating and melting the
burden. The carbon consumption for reduction obviously includes all the direct and
indirect reduction requirements.

50

In order to operate the blast furnace optimally, the furnace should be provided with a
minimum coke quantity, which is determined by the balance between minimum heat
and reduction requirements, i.e., the proportion of direct and indirect reduction.

7.2.2 Coke rate
Initially, the furnace consumed solely PC as injectant and had a coke consumption of
approximately 330 kg/thm. As NG is introduced to the furnace, it increases the H2
content of the reducing gas and increases the proportion of indirect reduction. This
shift can be observed as a decrease in the coke consumption (Figure 23). A higher
portion of indirect reduction has a potential for lowering the minimum coke
requirement.

Natural gas injection (kg/thm)

Figure 23: Variations in coke consumption with increasing NG injection

The injection is gradually changed from PC to NG, which increases the share of
reductions in the H2/H2O gas atmosphere. When a certain NG injection rate is reached,
51

it is however probable that introducing more NG will not decrease the consumption of
coke, due to increase in heat and reduction requirements. In the figure, this increase in
consumption is visible when the injection rate exceeds 87 kg/thm.
If NG is injected into the blast furnace in higher quantities, it may be feasible to operate
the BF at lower adiabatic flame temperature, as the iron reduction in the hydrogen
atmosphere is more efficient at higher temperatures and the burnout of PC is improved.
If a bigger proportion of the total reduction is carried out by indirect reduction, it will
require less heat, i.e., operating at lower temperature becomes feasible.

7.2.3 Emissions breakdown
The model uses the base case situation as a reference point for the subsequent
calculations, where the NG injection rate is gradually increased (by 2%, or 3 kg/thm),
solving the optimization problem to find the lowest emissions for each new point. It
should be noted that the solutions describe the whole steelworks, with the changes in
raw materials and energy use. Thus, the sources of emissions vary for the solutions.
Figure 24 illustrates emissions per ton of steel produced and the breakdown of the
emissions.

Figure 24: Emissions breakdown with increasing NG injection.

52

It can be observed in the figure that coal represents the overwhelming majority as a
source of emissions, exceeding 75% for some cases. This indicates the effect of the
carbon reduction on the emissions of the whole steelworks. In 2018, the official
emissions were approximately 1 590 kg per ton steel; calculated by dividing total
emissions (4 025 353 t CO2) with the production rate (2 530 425 t steel) of that year
(SSAB Raahe data, 2020).

7.3 Temperature limitations on the blast furnace operation
To yield feasible solutions, it is important to set limitations on certain variable values
of the model, temperatures being among the most important ones: blast furnaces are
operated according to certain guidelines and rules of thumb to be efficient and
productive. The furnaces temperature profile is one of the restricting factors, as
injection of NG reduces the adiabatic flame temperature. As the blast temperature was
fixed, the flame temperature had to be controlled by altering the blast oxygen content;
if the temperature is about to decrease below the lower temperature limit, the oxygen
content is increased. This has implications for the overall gas flow in the furnace and
therefore also for the top gas temperature.

7.3.1 Adiabatic flame temperature
The flame temperature is calculated by assuming adiabatic conditions so that the
incoming and outgoing energies are in balance (𝐸̇in = 𝐸̇out) in the raceway area. The
flame temperature that is obtained from the equation is assumed to be the lowest
feasible temperature at which the blast furnace can be operated with adequate heat,
e.g., for coal gasification and stable burden descent. It is worth noting that if the flame
temperature is very high, it has a negative impact on the furnace productivity and
efficiency; the burden descent may become unstable, the refractory wall is worn faster,
and the bosh gas volume becomes excessive. The flame temperature at the different
NG injection rates is presented in Figure 25.

Natural gas injection (kg/thm)

Figure 25: Effect of NG injection on adiabatic flame temperature.

Initially, as the injection rate of NG is increased, the adiabatic flame temperature
decreases until the lower limit (1950 C) is reached. As the NG injection rate is
increased above 27 kg/thm, the flame temperature is controlled by increasing the
oxygen content of the blast.

7.3.2 Top gas temperature
The gas temperature varies substantially in the furnace. The highest gas temperatures
occur in front of the tuyeres, where the combustion of coke and auxiliary reductants
occurs and the temperature of the gas leaving the raceway corresponds to the flame
temperature. This heated gas ascends through the burden, while heating and melting
the burden, before exiting the furnace as top gas. The temperature of the top gas is
important for the furnace’s overall efficiency. If the temperature is too low (e.g., below
100 C) this indicates that the flows of gas and solids are inappropriate and that the
gas cannot properly preheat the burden. In practice, this would delay the reduction
reactions and increase the direct reduction rate. At maximum productivity, the

54

temperature should be as low as possible without endangering operation stability. In
the model the lowest allowed top gas temperature is assumed to be 115 C.
The top gas temperature is affected by the blast variables, and in the calculations the
only variable that is not fixed is the oxygen content. As the oxygen content is increased,
the content of nitrogen is correspondingly decreased, leading to a lower flow rate of
gas through the process. This development can be observed in Figure 26 when natural
gas injection reaches 27 kg/thm as the top gas temperature decreases steadily beyond
this point. However, the lower limit of the top gas temperature was never reached for
the studied injection rates, which indicates that the top gas temperature was not a
restricting variable in the simulations.

7.3.3 Controlling the furnace temperature with blast oxygen
The blast oxygen content is used for controlling the flame temperature by, e.g.,
improving the combustion of injected PC (increasing coal devolatilization). Based on
the results, the oxygen content is primarily increased because of the minimum flame
55

temperature requirement (as the NG injection exceeds 27 kg/thm), as the top gas
temperature does not at any point reach its lower temperature limit. The oxygen
content of the blast is presented in Figure 27.

Figure 27: Blast oxygen content as a function of NG injection.

At Raahe the oxygen content of the blast is constrained by the blast furnace blowers,
with an upper limit of 30% oxygen. However, this constraint only applies to Raahe as
it is a technical constraint and does not represent a generic limit. Therefore, the results
should be scrutinized from the point-of-view of what injection rate is possible with the
current technical limitations at Raahe.
When the blast temperature is fixed to 1120 C, i.e., BFG is used for heating the blast,
NG injection of 78 kg/thm is the optimum, where the oxygen content is at most 30%.
It should be noted that higher injection rates have been utilized globally. However, for
these cases the oxygen limit may be higher and other arguments may be behind the
injection level, such as costs since NG may be cheap and abundant. The NG injection
of 78 kg/thm falls within the range 60 – 90 kg/thm presented by Geerdes et al. (2015a).

56

8. Energy and by-product gas balances for different production
rates
In chapter seven, it was shown that the mathematical model yielded solutions in overall
agreement with steelworks data, when the production rate was fixed to 260 t/h and the
blast heating was limited to 1120 C. In this chapter, the calculations will be made
similarly with hot rolled production rates of 260 t/h, 290 t/h and 320 t/h, but with blast
temperature increased to 1200 C by using LNG as a fuel in the cowpers. The
steelwork’s energy inflows and outflows will be changed by the increase in the
production quantity, which, in turn, will show the trends for how, e.g., the production
and consumption of BFG and COG will be affected by NG injection.

8.1 Blast furnace gas balance
Injecting NG into the blast furnace increases the hydrogen content of BFG, which will
lead to an increase in the heating value of the gas, as seen in Figure 28, where the
fluctuations are due to different solutions to the optimization problem with similar
overall emissions but small differences in the flow of LNG to the cowpers. For the
individual BFG consumers, this change in heating value is considered when
calculating the consumptions on-site.

Natural gas injection (kg/thm)

Figure 28: Effect of increased NG injection on the heating value of BFG.

The heating value is affected by a number of factors, one of which is the blast oxygen
content. The heating value increases modestly in the beginning (NG injection 0 – 57
kg/thm). However, after the injection rate exceeds 57 kg/thm, the blast oxygen content
increases, which increases the heating value considerably. This change in the blast
composition affects, among other things, the nitrogen content of the top gas, which can
be seen in the figure; less inert nitrogen gas increases the heating value of BFG.
The blast furnaces produce 415 – 470 kNm3/h of BFG (see Figure 29). Initially, BFG
production increases slightly at the same time as the blast oxygen content decreases in
all of the cases. After the NG injection reaches 45 kg/thm, the blast volume decreases
considerably and the oxygen content increases, which leads to an overall decrease in
the consumption of BFG in blast heating in the cowpers. The reason for the decrease
in blast volume is that the injection of NG requires more oxygen, which substitutes air.
However, the higher the injection rate, the higher the bosh gas volume.

Figure 29: BFG production and consumption with increasing NG injection.

The decrease in the blast volume influences the electricity consumption of the blast
furnaces. In all the cases, the coke plant uses approximately the same amount of BFG.
The remaining BFG is combusted by the power plant and approximately 2% of the
total amount is flared. At the power plant, the consumption of BFG increases, even
though the blast volume decreases and less BFG is available.

8.2 Coke oven gas balance
The production in the coke plant is assumed to be steady at 90 t/h coke and 46.8
kNm3/h COG. Furthermore, it is assumed that the COG consumption of other units is
linearly dependent on the strip and plate production rate. The remaining COG, after all
other consumers, is then combusted at the power plant and is flared. The amount of
flared COG is assumed to be 3 % of the total consumption.

59

Due to the dynamic aspects of the rolling mill production, the consumption of COG
varies considerably. If the heating furnaces need to operate at maximum capacity, it
may not be possible to supply enough COG. On the other hand, if there is a stoppage
(due to maintenance or other scheduled events) or an abrupt (unscheduled) stoppage
in the coil or plate production, the mills obviously consume less COG. However, the
availability of COG has at times been a constraining factor for the rolling mills
operations, leading to problems in the production.
The availability of COG is sufficient for a strip and plate production rate of 260 t/h in
steady state. When the production rate is increased to 290 t/h, operating the furnaces
of the rolling mills is hampered because of a lack of COG. For this thesis, the question
of how this deficit should be balanced for the steelworks to have an adequate supply
of COG was answered by investigating the on-site consumption (Table 9). The
identified locations where LNG could be used to replace COG were the ladle heating,
the lime kilns, the coke plant and the power plant. In the table, the consumption of
COG is dependent on the production rate. When COG is replaced with LNG, it has a
replacement value in the column on the right side of COG consumption.

Ladles are used in transporting hot metal and molten steel; to withstand thermal wear,
the ladles are pre-heated by using COG. However, if the fuel type is changed, it cannot
be done without taking into consideration the needed changes for implementing the
new fuel, e.g., piping, oxygen feed, fuel nozzles etc.
At Raahe steelworks, there is currently a plan to redesign the ladle heating system: a
number of fuel alternatives have been proposed, including COG, LPG and LNG. As
the existing heating system will be completely replaced, there is no need to assess the
changes that would be needed to upgrade the existing system. If the LNG alternative
is selected from these alternatives, there would obviously be a lower consumption of
COG.

61

The efficiency of the preheating furnaces in the rolling mills improves as the
production rate is increased, which has an effect on the consumption of LNG. This
would effectively mean that in actual cases the consumption of LNG would be lower
compared to the LNG consumption presented in Table 9. However, most of the focus
was put on the blast furnace and the effects of LNG injection. Therefore, the
consumption of COG naturally increases with increasing production rates at some
locations. After the production rate was increased to 290 t/h, LNG replaced COG
partially at the coke plant and completely at the steel plant ladle heating. For the coke
plant battery 1, the consumption of COG decreases by 2.46 kNm3/h and LNG is
introduced with a rate of 1.30 kNm3/h. When the production rate is further increased
to 320 t/h, the COG consumption at the rolling mills increased from 21.79 kNm3/h to
23.95 kNm3/h. The option of further lowering the amount of COG at the coke plant is
still possible, but this is not necessary as battery 1 is assumed to have a lower limit for
COG consumption (1.5 kNm3/h), whereas the COG consumption at 320 t/h greatly
exceeds the available gas from battery 1. However, adequate amounts of COG can be
relocated from the lime kilns to the rolling mills (up to 2.95 kNm3/h). After this is
done, LNG is used as a replacement fuel in the kilns (1.32 kNm3/h).

8.3 Power plant
As the BFG heating value increases with the increase in the hydrogen content, there is
a potential for lowering the COG consumption at the power plant; compared to the
base case, the power plant would obtain more heat from BFG. The power plant
consumes the remaining COG supply after the coke plant, lime kilns and steel plant.
For the different production rates, the COG consumption amounted to 5.83 kNm3/h,
6.35 kNm3/h and 7.01 kNm3/h, respectively.
The effect of the BFG heating value on the combustion of COG is not taken into
consideration. If the boilers are operated at a minimum capacity, the needed COG is
lower if more heat can be obtained from BFG. Therefore, the remaining COG is
utilized at the rolling mills and the energy deficit is covered by LNG, which in turn
maximizes the COG consumption of the rolling mills. It is, however, worth noting that
62

the power plant’s consumption of COG (and auxiliary fuels) is dependent on the
operating rate of the rolling mills.

8.3.1 Electricity balance
The power plant has an important role of generating electricity, steam and district heat
for the steel plant’s needs as well as to supply district heat to the city of Raahe. The
boiler receives and combusts by-product gases, BFG and COG, as well as auxiliary
fuels. In steady state, the auxiliary fuel consumption is assumed to be 6000 kWth LNG
and 1200 kWth heating oil. These are assumptions on the boiler’s minimum hourly
consumption of auxiliary fuels. Cases where auxiliary fuels are predominantly used,
such as during blast furnace stoppages, are not considered here.
In practice, auxiliary fuels are used when certain operating conditions are not met or
are changed, such as:
1. The boiler’s minimum superheating temperature
2. Steam amount for the turbine to reach minimum flow rate
3. Changes in the outside temperature (seasons), that affect the heat balance of the
steelworks.
The power plant boiler generates steam that is primarily used for generating electricity.
The feed of fuels to the power plant and the electricity generation for the respective
production rate can be seen in Figure 30.

The steelworks uses many sources of energy, besides fuels, such as electricity (Figure
30), steam and district heat (Figure 32). For supplying the majority of electricity and
generating steam and electricity, the power plant has an important function. The steam
and district heat balances are important to produce hot rolled products, as steam is,
e.g., used at the coke plant, blast furnaces and rolling mills, while district heat is mainly
used for heating. The electricity consumption and balance are presented in Figure 31.

Figure 31: Electricity balance and consumptions as a function of NG injection.

Electricity is consumed by all the modelled units. The electricity balance is calculated
by subtracting the total electricity generation at the power plant with that of the
individual consumers and depending on whether the balance is negative or positive,
the purchasing or selling of electricity is chosen. According to the specialists of the
steelworks, the power plant generates approximately 72% of the total consumption and
the rest is purchased. Most of the consumers have a steady consumption of electricity
except for two consumers, namely the blowers and the air separation units (ASUs). As
expected, the blast volume and oxygen content are reflected in the electricity
consumption; a decrease in the blast volume decreases the electricity consumption of
the air compressors, whereas an increase in the blast oxygen content increases the
electricity consumption of the ASUs. As more NG is injected into the blast furnace,
the electricity generation of the power plant increases, which eventually leads to a

65

positive electricity balance; generation surpasses the consumption of the steelworks
when the LNG injection rate in the blast furnace exceeds 108 kg/thm.
For the steelworks economy and fuel consumption, it is more reasonable to primarily
combust by-product gases and to reduce the consumption of auxiliary fuels. It is
currently cheaper to purchase electricity than it is to use auxiliary fuels for generating
it. The boiler should therefore rather be operated on a minimum superheating
temperature with the by-product gases, and the deficit electricity should be purchased
from the grid. In practice, however, the power plant is not necessarily able to utilize
the excess BFG as is assumed in this chapter; it would require some changes in the
way that the blast furnaces and cowpers are operated, such as technical planning,
improved automation and overall optimization (e.g., of the cowpers).
The calculated values for the energy generation are somewhat overly positive when it
comes to the larger LNG injection rates, as the maximum capacity for steam is
approximately 110 – 120 kg/s, which is effectively reached when the electricity
generation reaches 120 – 130 MWe. With the current power plant setup and limitations,
the predicted electricity generation would not increase after this point. Also, the use of
auxiliary fuels would be changed if the blast furnaces would produce more BFG.
Therefore, it is probable that the increase in the available BFG would also decrease the
current auxiliary fuel use. But, as was previously mentioned, it is preferable to
purchase electricity, which would for the boiler operations imply that the minimum
operating conditions are met. However, if the maximum steam generation is surpassed,
this excess energy would be very difficult to utilize. It is also worth noting that the
higher the proportions of BFG and COG to the power plant are the higher the
possibility of flaring.

66

8.3.2 District heat balance
Heat is used by the consumers in the steelworks and the city of Raahe (under the name
“Sold district heat” in Figure 32). The consumption of the steelworks is dependent on
the strip and plate production rate, with the surplus heat, finally, being sold as district
heat.

Figure 32: District heat production and consumption.

District heat is obtained by tapping the turbine MP section (from the steam outlets)
and from the steel plant waste heat. For the heat production, the steady state production
is assumed to be in the range of 28 – 34 MW for the steel plant and the power plant;
production at the power plant increases slightly with increasing LNG injection (Figure
30). The consumption of the briquetting plant is very modest compared to the other
consumers; it represents only approximately 0.7% of the total consumption.
However, there are several matters that affects the actual district heat consumption
e.g., yearly temperature differences and the current state of the district heat pipeline to

67

the city. In contrast, the yearly differences in sold district heat can vary between 0 MW
during summer and 30 – 40 MW during winter. The model calculates that increasing
the LNG injection rate has a positive effect on the steam and electricity generation, but
as the heat generation cannot be fully utilized because of the state of the pipeline, it is
probable that the effects on district heat would be small.

68

9. Potential use of LNG in reducing emissions
So far, the thesis has studied the changes in the energy balance of the Raahe Steelworks
when increasing the injection of NG in the blast furnaces. This chapter studies the
effect of using LNG on the CO2 emissions at the steelworks. The analysis will give
estimates of both the direct and indirect emissions. An estimate on the total amount of
LNG consumed for the different cases studied will also be reported. The analysis is
based on the different production rates of hot rolled products studied earlier, i.e., 260
t/h, 290 t/h and 320 t/h.

9.1 Using LNG for heating blast
By contrast to the treatment in earlier sections of the thesis, the possibility to increase
the temperature of the blast to 1200 C by using NG as a fuel in the cowpers was
considered. Technically this should be feasible, but at present the option is too
expensive partly due to taxation. However, this alternative may become economically
feasible in the future.
Figure 33 illustrates the effect of a higher blast temperature on the estimated specific
emissions of the steel plant. The increase in blast temperature is seen to have a
significant effect on the emissions, especially at higher NG injection rates in the blast
furnace. For a production rate of 260 t/h, the reduction in emissions varies from
approximately 0.4% in (for PC injection only) to approximately 5.7% (for an NG
injection rate of 93 kg/thm). Therefore, emissions can be suppressed by using NG for
blast heating. The amount of LNG used in the cowpers is presented in Figure 34. It is
seen that about 1.5 – 2.0 kNm3/h of natural gas is needed in the cowpers, but as the
NG injection rate in the blast furnace exceeds 50 kg/thm, the need decreases
dramatically to become zero at a NG injection rate of about 66 kg/thm. The reason for
the fluctuations seen in the figure is the same as mentioned in section 8.1, i.e., that
slightly different solutions to the problem of minimizing the CO2 emissions in the steel
plant are found for different NG injection rates.

After NG injection is increased to 66 kg/thm, the model estimates that the cowpers can
be heated solely with BFG as the heating value of the gas is higher. This is a significant
difference from the base case, where BFG alone yielded a blast temperature of 1120
C.

9.2 Fuel replacement
The work also studied the possibility of using LNG in cutting scrapped metal and the
machine planer. After discussing with the area experts, it was stated that there was a
possibility to use LNG, but for this to be plausible new technical planning and overall
modifications to the machinery would be required. For scrap cutting, modifications
would be required of the oxygen feed and nozzle technology. The case of the machine
planer is more complicated as the current machinery is out-dated: parts of the piping
and the fuel distributor were made in the 1970s and even the present gas feed is
difficult. Furthermore, the oxygen piping is under-dimensioned according to modern
standards, which for the machinery (if LNG is utilized) would lead to considerable
modification to the fuel nozzles, the feed of oxygen and would, ultimately, require
overall technical planning. For the purpose of this thesis, it is however reasonable to
give an estimate on the effects of using LNG as an alternative fuel in the future.
The consumption of oil is for the most part caused by the power plant boiler K3 and
the vehicles used on-site. However, in the present study the fuel consumption of
vehicles and other non-stationary consumers are neglected, but these are mentioned
here as a side note. Also, the boiler K3 will be decommissioned in the future, which
will lead to a lower overall oil consumption.
In the model, the following fuels changes to LNG were considered in the steelworks:
-

LPG in the scrap cutting and the machine planer units

-

Heating oil in the power plant.

71

For these, the effects on fuel consumption and emissions are presented in Table 10
reporting the amount of LNG needed to replace the substituted fuel and the
corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions.

For scrap cutting and machine planer, the consumption of LPG is assumed to be
dependent on the strip and plate production rate, which effectively means that the
decrease of the emissions grows with increasing production rate. After LPG was
replaced with LNG, the emissions reduction for scrap cutting and machine planer were
approximately 0.31 and 0.22 kg CO2 per ton hot rolled products. The power plant, on
the other hand, is assumed to consume 7200 kWth of auxiliary fuels per hour
(approximately 1200 kWth as heating oil). For all the production rates, this amounted
to a decrease in emissions of 0.22-0.27 kg per ton hot rolled products, depending on
the production rate. In percent, scrap cutting and machine planer together showed a
14.3% decrease in emissions, while the corresponding number for the power plant was
4.8%.

72

9.3 Theoretical emissions reductions at different production levels
In chapter six, it was shown that the emissions estimates were strongly dependent on
the blast furnace operations. Figure 35 illustrates the potential of increasing NG
injection in reducing emissions.

Natural gas injection (kg/thm)

Figure 35: Emissions reduction in kg per ton hot rolled product with increasing NG
injection.

Changing the injected hydrocarbon from coal to NG initially reduces the coke rate of
the furnace. This, together with the associated changes in the blast volume and oxygen
content, as well as in the quantity and composition of the top gas have a significant
impact on the emissions of the entire steelworks.
However, as both reduction and thermal conditions in the blast furnace must be
appropriate, the coke rate decreases only up to a certain point, after which it starts to
increase for the heat and reduction requirements to be met. In the cases studied, this

73

point was reached when NG injection rate was 93 kg/thm (and PC injection rate of 57
kg/thm), yielding a coke rate of 298 kg/thm.
For the furnace to operate properly, a minimum coke rate is needed, as coke is the
primary fuel and reducing agent. Injecting NG has a positive effect on reducing
emissions as the consumption of PC and coke decreases if the furnace can be operated
at a lower flame temperature (1950 C). As more NG is injected, the shift from direct
to indirect reduction and the shift from carbon to hydrogen reduction led to lower
emissions as more hydrogen gas was used in the reduction reactions.
Initially, the flame temperature decreases (from 2110 C) while the amount of blast
increases, and the oxygen content decreases. After the lower limit of the adiabatic
flame temperature has been reached, the flame temperature is controlled by increasing
the blast oxygen content. After NG injection has reached 45 kg/thm, the blast volume
starts to decrease while the oxygen content increases steadily.

9.3.1 The effect of blast oxygen content on the emissions
With the blast oxygen limit of 30%, the lowest emission value per ton of product was
reached when the NG injection was 84 kg/thm (PCI being 66 kg/thm) and the coke
rate was 299 kg/thm. In estimating the potential of reducing emissions by utilizing
LNG, the relative difference between the base case situation and the optimum was
calculated.
The least emitting NG injection rate, i.e., 93 kg/thm, could not be reached with the
current infrastructure, as the blowers have an oxygen limit of 30%and the optimum
state has a blast oxygen content of 32%. Table 11 reports the emissions reductions in
tons per hour at NG injections of 84 kg/thm (30% oxygen) and 93 kg/thm (32%
oxygen) for the studied production rates. These are approximate values which were
calculated by multiplying the emissions reduction in Figure 35 with the respective
production rate.

74

limits.

Thus, the emissions reduction for the steelworks falls in the range of 25 – 31 t CO2/h,
which is a significant improvement to the base case.

9.3.2 Effects of NG injection on the indirect emissions
The increase in the BFG heating value resulting from the increasing injection rate of
NG in the blast furnace had a positive effect on the electricity generation in the power
plant. This led to a positive development in the electricity balance, which was
presented in the previous chapter. In practice, the power plant covers approximately
72% of the total electricity demand of the steelworks in question. Thus, at present the
electricity deficit must be covered by external purchasing.
As the injection of NG has a positive effect on the electricity generation, it also showed
a positive trend for the reduction of emissions from this indirect source (Figure 36).
Here, the national average (in 2019) of 91 kg CO2/MWh was used for the purchased
electricity; this value was extracted from the data of Fingrid (2020). It should be noted
that estimating emissions from an external source is difficult since the emissions may
vary. Furthermore, an industrial consumer can naturally purchase electricity stemming
from (more) renewable sources, which have a lower carbon footprint.

Figure 36: Indirect emissions from electricity purchasing in tons CO2 per hour.

Even though the production rates correspond to different electricity consumptions, it
can be observed that as the power plant increases its electricity generation (at an NG
injection rate of 84 kg/thm) the indirect emissions are approximately 60% lower than
in the base case. Still, practical constraints may prevent this development.

9.4 Analysis of results and practical limitations
So far, the theoretical calculations and emissions estimates have illustrated the
versatility of the model and the effects of LNG on the operation of the steelworks. For
the model, however, there is no practical limit on the LNG that is used. The total
consumption of NG at the steelworks with increasing NG injection is presented in
Figure 37.

76

Figure 37: Total consumption of NG per hour with increasing NG injection for strip
and plate production rates 260 t/h, 290 t/h and 320 t/h.

When studying the consumption of the steelworks, the change of the consumption of
LNG in the blast furnace is significant. With lower LNG injection rates, it can be noted
that the LNG consumption of the furnaces is reasonable compared to the other
consumers. The consumptions for the other production units are for the most part

77

steady but for, e.g., the cowpers, the consumption decreases as the BFG heating value
increases. In this case, however, the effect of LNG injection can be observed in the
higher heating value of the by-product gas. The rolling mills are another significant
consumer of LNG. In practice, the consumption of LNG is also dependent on the
average efficiency of the preheating furnaces; for the larger production rates, there is
a lot more COG available, which would effectively replace some of the LNG. Issues
related to efficiency and NG consumption have been excluded from the model because
the impact on total emissions is relatively small.
In the model, the total consumption of LNG does not have an upper limit. However, it
is unlikely that the consumption of NG can be supplied in the short term in order to
achieve the overall optimum predicted by the model. The LNG requirements at this
point are huge; practical constraints such as storage and logistics are challenging to
implement, not to mention the needed investments and other operating costs. Given
the current capabilities and needs of the plant, the present author’s opinion is that in
the short term, an LNG injection of about 40 kg/thm (PC 110 kg/thm) could be
realistic. The gas and energy balances of the model plant for the different production
rates of rolled products are presented in Appendix 2. With this injection rate, the
reduction in the emissions would be approximately 50 kg per ton of rolled steel.

78

10. Conclusions and future work
The purpose of this thesis was to clarify the potential use of LNG for reducing
emissions at Raahe Steelworks. In order to succeed in this endeavour, a mathematical
model of the steel plant was tuned to roughly correspond to the reference plant and
solved to minimize the total emissions of the system.

10.1 Results summary
The results showed that there is a significant potential for reducing emissions by using
LNG at the steelworks. With the current technical limitations, the lowest overall
emissions for the steelworks were reached when the injection rates of natural gas and
pulverized coal were 84 kg/thm and 66 kg/thm, respectively. With these injection rates,
the coke consumption decreased by approximately 8.3%. However, at this point the
consumption of LNG would be significantly higher and it is unlikely that such
quantities of LNG could be supplied and handled in the short term. Therefore, an LNG
injection rate of 40 kg /thm (PC injection 110 kg/thm and coke rate decrease of 5%)
would be a more realistic estimate. This injection rate would reduce the emissions by
approximately 50 kg per ton steel, which would be a significant improvement
compared to the base case.
The emissions of the steelworks were predicted to decrease significantly until the LNG
injection was 84 kg/thm; at this injection rate, the emissions reduction was 90 kg per
ton of steel. Natural gas as an injectant had a positive effect on reducing the overall
emissions and on the energy balance of the steelworks. The effect of LNG injection
could also be observed in other parts of the steelworks where BFG was consumed,
such as in the cowpers. The use of BFG and LNG for blast heating was also
significantly affected by the changes in the heating value of BFG. In summary, there
were several benefits from introducing NG in the blast furnaces.
In other locations, changing fuels to LNG showed smaller decrease in the emissions
of the steelworks; the reduction was dependent on the studied production rate.

79

Machines that originally operated on LPG (scrap cutting and the machine planer) had
about 15% lower emissions after the change in fuel. According to the specialists at
Raahe, this would require modifications and overall optimization for the change to be
possible. Similarly, if the power plant would replace heating oil by LNG, an emissions
reduction of 5% in the power plant could be expected.

10.2 Risk assessment
The results show a potential for the by-product gas balance of the steelworks if the
technical and operating aspects are in order. By-product gases and fuels are consumed
ideally, which naturally should be noted when assessing risks.
As the NG injection increases significantly, it leads to a decrease in blast volume and
lowers blast heating requirements at the cowpers. This development in the heating
requirements is unlikely as the cowpers need to be operated with a reasonable capacity
or they will be affected by a lower efficiency. A lower blast volume would require that
changes be made to the automation and operating parameters of the cowpers, as well
as production optimization. At the power plant, on the other hand, the increase in BFG
consumption leads to technical problems that would restrict the steam generation and
the potential use of fuels in the boiler. The estimated boiler outputs at the optimal
solution corresponds to too high values of steam generation, as the upper limit is 110
– 120 kg/s.
The steelworks model was solved with regards to the lowest CO2 emission value. If a
different approach had been chosen, the answers given by the model would also have
been different e.g., the cheapest price per ton steel or the lowest coke rate. For the
model, certain effects were also excluded as their impact on the emissions estimate
was assumed to be small or negligible. One such effect was the effectivity and LNG
consumption of the preheating furnaces at the rolling mills. It is beneficial for the gas
economy of the steelworks to use as much of the available COG as possible for the
preheating ovens. If more COG is utilized, it would naturally decrease the consumption

80

of NG at the rolling mills. This effect should be observed if the emissions of individual
units are studied more carefully.

10.3 Future work
In the future, the co-injection of NG and PC and the devolatilization of coal should be
modelled more accurately. The model used in this thesis does not consider the effect
of NG injection on the burnout of PC. Thus, a model that purely focuses on the region
where the injection lance, blowpipe and tuyere are situated should be utilized for
calculating this effect. In addition, assessing the effect on PC burnout under different
conditions, such as outside temperatures, and with different coal particles could be
accomplished by using pilot furnaces.
Other practical limitations and modifications should be studied before a decision is
made on the implementation of NG use. The required LNG infrastructure is a factor
that limits higher LNG consumptions as the transportation and supply would be
difficult without major investments. Fuel nozzles and piping are some of the
modifications that should also be examined before switching fuels.
In addition, improving the operational and technical aspects of the cowpers and
blowers would help operating the blast furnaces more effectively. By utilizing a higher
blast oxygen content, CO2 emissions and coke consumption could be further decreased
by increasing the injection of NG. In this case, upgrading the blowers would be
beneficial for further decreasing emissions in the future.

Sammanfattning på svenska
Stål är en viktig vara som används inom olika områden, exempelvis inom tillverkning
och infrastruktur. Förbrukningen av stål är en god indikation på nationell tillväxt,
vilket kan observeras i t.ex. de växande ekonomierna i Asien. En tillväxt förväntas
också över hela världen, vilket kommer att leda till en ökning av konsumtionen och
produktionen av råstål. År 2018 var den globala produktionen cirka 1,8 miljarder ton.
Stål produceras i stålverk som är specifika fabriker som har de nödvändiga enheterna
för att producera produkterna ifråga. Eftersom stålframställningsprocessen behandlar
smält metall och varma halvfabrikat kräver processerna mycket energi och råmaterial.
Järnframställningsprocessen är avgörande vid produktionen av stål. I denna process
erhålls smält råjärn ur järnmalm som reducerats och smälts i en masugn. Ugnen matas
med järnmalm och koks, där koks utgör ugnens primära bränsle och kolkälla för
reducering av järnmalmen. Kol är en central komponent i processen, men dess
användning leder till stora koldioxidutsläpp och därför har denna traditionella
järnframställningsprocess utsatts för kritisk granskning. Detta har lett till att man idag
studerat alternativa sätt att förse ugnen med tillräckliga mängder reduktionsmedel och
energi. Ett sådant bränslealternativ är flytande naturgas, LNG (eng. liquefied natural
gas) som främst består av metan.
Syftet med arbetet är att utvärdera potentialen i att använda flytande naturgas för att
minska utsläppen vid SSAB stålverk i Brahestad, med speciell fokus på stålverkets
energibalans. Problemet studerades beräkningstekniskt genom att med en matematisk
modell utvärdera den förväntade effekten om naturgas ersätter andra energikällor på
olika platser i stålverket. Eftersom masugnen behöver betydande mängder av både
värme och reduktionsmedel är den det processhelhet man kan förvänta sig den största
minskningen av utsläpp för och därför har arbetet fokuserats på effekten av
naturgasinjektion i masugn.
I arbetet användes en matematisk modell av stålverket som löstes med avsikt att finna
driftspunkten med de lägsta CO2-utsläppen under olika driftsbetingelser. För att

82

utvärdera den potentiella minskningen av koldioxidutsläppen i Brahestads stålverk,
anpassades modellen först till stålverksdata, så att ett basfall erhölls. Detta användes
som referenspunkt vid utvärdering av effekten på koldioxidutsläppen när naturgas
introduceras. Modellekvationerna formuleras som ett optimeringsproblem där CO2utsläppen minimeras med avseende på några centrala storheter i masugnen. Stålverket
studerades för olika produktionsnivåer (260 t/h, 290 t/h och 320 t/h stålämnen) med
antagandet att verket drivs under stabila omständigheter i fortvarighet.
Resultaten indikerar att det finns en betydande potential att minska utsläppen genom
att använda LNG vid stålverket. Med de nuvarande tekniska begränsningarna nåddes
de lägsta totala utsläppen för det modellerade stålverket när injektionsmängderna för
naturgas och kolpulver var 84 kg/trj respektive 66 kg/trj (där trj betecknar ton råjärn).
Härvid minskade koksförbrukningen i masugnen med cirka 8 %. Stålverkets
förbrukning av naturgas skulle dock vara betydande och det förefaller osannolikt att
så stora mängder naturgas kunde levereras och hanteras på verket inom nära framtid.
Därför anser författaren till arbetet att en naturgasinjektionsmängd på omkring 40
kg/trj (vid en kolpulverinjektion på ca. 110 kg/trj), med en minskning av
koksförbrukningen med 5 % kunde vara ett mer realistiskt koncept. Detta skulle
minska de totala utsläppen med cirka 50 kg per ton stål, vilket är en betydande
förbättring jämfört med basfallet.
Genom att utnyttja naturgas som injektionsmedel fås också en positiv effekt på övriga
delar av stålverket då masugnsgasens värmevärde stiger. T.ex. i cowprarna, där
masugnens förbränningsluft förvärms, förväntas en stor skillnad då en ”rikare” gas
leder till bättre förvärmning av blästern. Även i kraftverket leder det högre
värmevärdet för masugngasen till större el- och värmegenerering.
Att byta bränsle till naturgas ledde också till några minskningar i stålverkets utsläpp
som härstammar från andra delar av processen och minskningen var beroende av
produktionshastigheten. Maskiner som ursprungligen drivs med LPG (skrotning och
hyvling) uppvisade nästan 15 % lägre utsläpp efter bränslebytet till naturgas. Enligt
specialisterna i Brahestad skulle maskinerna dock kräva modifikation och även andra

83

omställningar i driften borde ske för att uppnå den beräknade minskningen i utsläpp.
Om kraftverket skulle byta brännolja till naturgas vore den estimerade
utsläppsminskning ca 5 %.
Vissa aspekter borde dock studeras vidare för att riskbedömningen, dvs. felmarginalen,
ska kunna hanteras. De största osäkerheterna har att göra med energi- och
biproduktgasflöden. Masugnsgasen har i modellen beräknats produceras och
konsumeras idealt, vilket bl.a. leder till att kraftverksproduktion ökar när
masugnsgasens värmevärde stiger. Likaså förväntas en kraftig förbättring i cowprarnas
prestanda. Det är dock sannolikt att gränsvärden nås, vilket i praktiken begränsar
mängden naturgas som kan injekteras. T.ex. kan en obalans mellan produktion och
förbrukning av gaserna leda till ökad fackling, vilket begränsar de positiva effekterna
av ökad naturgasinjektion i masugnen.
Vissa aspekter beaktades inte i modellen då deras inverkan på utsläppsuppskattningen
antogs vara liten eller försumbar. En sådan faktor var effekten av valsverkens
effektivitet på förvärmningsugnarnas förbrukning av naturgas. Om förbrukningen av
koksgas ökar (och gas är tillgänglig) är det möjligt att mer fördelaktigt ersätta naturgas
i förvärmningsugnarna, men detta beaktades inte i modellen. Denna effekt borde ändå
klargöras i framtiden om utsläppen från enskilda enheter studeras mer noggrant.
