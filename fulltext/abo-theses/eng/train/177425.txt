Title: Managing change using a socio-technical approach: staff perspectives on new library
system implementation
Supervisor: Prof. Anssi Öörni
Abstract: Digitalization has placed new requirements for both the technical architecture and
organizational capabilities of information services. This thesis examines library staff perceptions
of the implementation of a new library system in Finnish higher education libraries. Diffusion of
innovations and social construction of technology literature were applied to study the differences
in perceptions between staff groups, the mediating effect of personal innovativeness, and the state
of technological frames in the libraries in order to suggest change management practices.
The data set of the study was gathered via a questionnaire and was then subjected to a principal
component analysis, followed by regression and mediation analyses. Level of education and the
staff member’s position at the library were both significant predictors of perceived usability.
Work experience in the library field correlated negatively with perceived usability. Personal
innovativeness was discovered to be a very strong mediating variable between level of education,
usability, and trialability.
Overall differences between user groups were low, indicating high social cohesion and congruent
technological frames. It is suggested that managers focus on identifying and designating
innovative employees as change agents regardless of the employee’s educational background or
current position. Support and training should be provided especially to employees with a lower
level of education or longer work experience in libraries.
Keywords: diffusion of innovations, innovation characteristics, personal innovativeness, social
construction of technology, change management, libraries, quantitative methods, principal
component analysis, regression analysis, analysis of variance, mediation analysis

1 INTRODUCTION
Digitalization is changing the operational and strategic landscape of both private and
public organizations. The access, availability, and application of digital resources is
especially important for both users and providers of information services. Libraries have
historically been at the forefront of providing the public with access to technological
innovations before they were adopted into the mainstream. For example, Finnish public
libraries introduced Internet access for patrons as a service in the mid-90’s, when
household dial-up connections were rather rare and used mostly by early adopters.
Since then, mobile connectivity, digital information resources, and increasing
competition between digital services have increased tremendously. This is especially
visible in higher education libraries, which often need to provide a large number of users
with access to very specific domain knowledge. In Finnish higher education libraries,
nearly 12 million electronic books were available in 2018 – in total, that is over 75% of
all monographs in these libraries (National Library of Finland, 2020).
While these libraries have oriented themselves towards digital services, the shift to digital
resources also places more requirements for the library systems used by the staff to
acquire, catalog, and provide access to resources. Library systems are very complex
pieces of software: they include not only metadata of information resources, but also
sensitive patron data, order and invoice data, operational logic, reporting tools, and often
a separate user interface for staff users and patrons. Often, these features are
interconnected into other systems both outside and within the libraries’ immediate
organization. Connectivity with other libraries, ERP systems, vendor systems, and student
registries is crucial to reduce the amount of redundant work and data cleanup.
Simultaneously, librarians themselves must be able to learn how to cope with changes in
both operative workflows and possible larger strategic developments facilitated by new
technologies.
This thesis examines the implementation of a new library system in Finnish higher
education libraries as a result of the paradigm shift of digitalization. The study is focused
on the relationship between the sociodemographic background variables of library staff
and the perceptions the staff members have towards using the new system. The objective
of the thesis is to analyze potential differences between user groups in order to suggest
1

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

practices for change management and identifying groups who may require more support
during change processes. The theoretical framework of the study is based on literature of
both diffusion of innovations theory and the social construction of technology.
The rest of Chapter 1 introduces the project organization and the context of the
implementation project in more detail. Chapter 2 introduces a literature review into
innovations, technology adoption, and the social construction of technology. Chapter 3 is
focused on research design and methodology. Chapter 4 features an analysis of the results,
and Chapter 5 includes discussion on the implications, applications, and limitations of the
study.

1.1 The Lumikko project organization
Finnish higher education libraries can be divided into two main categories: university
libraries and university of applied sciences libraries. In the early 2000s, both types of
libraries set up consortiums for the tendering, acquisition and implementation of a library
system and to improve collaboration between libraries: the Linnea2 consortium for
university libraries and the AMKIT consortium for polytechnic institution libraries. Both
consortia settled on using the same integrated library system, which consisted of several
discrete modules for separate library processes such as acquisitions, cataloguing, and
circulation. Linnea2 went live with their implementation in 2001, with AMKIT libraries
following by the end of 2003. The local system instances for all libraries were hosted on
CSC servers in Espoo.
In the early 2010s, increased demand for electronic resources resulted in libraries
reassessing the availability for digital resources. Thereafter, the UKJ project was formed
to map out the development and implementation of a new library system (Ahlqvist &
Kivimäki, 2013). While UKJ did not produce a new system and eventually folded in 2014,
the national end user interface Finna was developed to facilitate access to digital
materials. Each participating information service can apply for their own Finna instance,
with a national Finna catalog aggregating results from each participating organization
(National Library of Finland, 2016).
After UKJ, libraries continued to study alternatives for the successor of the library system
which had at that point been use for nearly 15 years. Differences between library sizes,

2

userbase preferences, scientific disciplines in each institution, and internal work processes
made it difficult for one solution to fit the needs of every library. Subsequently, it was
agreed that the acquisition and implementation successor system would not be tendered
on a national consortium level. Instead, two groups emerged: libraries which opted for a
SaaS-based commercial library platform product, and libraries which chose an open
source library software to build upon, using the existing CSC infrastructure. System
customizability, integrations, and maintenance costs were important considerations for
both approaches (Keskitalo, 2019).
The group of libraries opting for the SaaS library platform organized themselves into a
project group, dubbed Lumikko. The Lumikko libraries functioned as a loose consortium:
the tendering procedure covered all the participating libraries, but each system instance
would be contracted separately. A total of 26 libraries were involved in the project, with
a total of 17 unique library system instances. Due to the size of the project, the Lumikko
libraries implemented the new system in two waves. Wave one libraries included Turku
University, Åbo Akademi, University of Eastern Finland, Turku University of Applied
Science, Karelia University of Applied Sciences, Satakunta University of Applied
Sciences, Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences libraries, and Tampere University
Library (a merger between Tampere University, Tampere University of Technology, and
Tampere University of Applied Sciences libraries).
Wave two libraries include Helsinki University Library (and other Helka libraries),
Library of Parliament, Oulu University Library, Uniarts Helsinki Library, Lapland
University Consortium, Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences, Kajaani University of
Applied Sciences, Lahti University of Applied Sciences, Oulu University of Applied
Sciences, and Savonia University of Applied Sciences libraries. Throughout the
implementation project, Lumikko libraries have collaborated with the National Library
of Finland to ensure system compatibility with national metadata services and Finna.

1.1.1 Project timeline and milestones
The first wave of the project began with an onboarding phase in April 2019, during which
project groups at libraries acquainted themselves with introductory materials provided by
the system provider. Preliminary data cleaning was done at libraries during the late spring
and early summer, based on instructions and best practices suggested by both the system

3

provider and other Nordic libraries using the same library system. Access to a training
sandbox with virtual patron and bibliographic data was provided to the libraries in late
April 2019, mostly to familiarize staff with the user interface and general features of the
system.
For wave one, the implementation period began in July 2019, during which system
configuration and migration parameters were defined. A test load from the legacy system
to the production environment of the new system was performed in September 2019 for
all wave one libraries. After the test load, alterations to the final configuration were made
in conjunction with on-site training by the system provider. The bulk of library staff
training was held between late November and early December 2019. The final system
load was done during the first half of December 2019, eliminating the test data from the
production environment and migrating in the latest data from the legacy system. The new
system went live on December 23rd, 2019, but most wave one libraries prohibited patron
access until the start of January 2020 in order to go through a task list of system checkups. Switch to support took place at the end of February 2020. Wave two is set to go live
in July 2020.

2 PERSPECTIVES

INTO

INNOVATIONS

AND

TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION
The word innovation has seen widespread use in public discourse throughout the new
millennium. In mainstream media, innovations tend to be linked with emergent
technologies, economic growth, and sometimes unwarranted marketing hype. The
Merriam Webster dictionary defines innovation rather broadly as “the introduction of
something new” (Merriam-Webster, 2020). In contrast, Everett M. Rogers defined
innovation as “an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or
other unit of adoption” (Rogers, 2003, 12). The distinction is not only semantic: Rogers
postulated that innovation is a subjectively experienced entity, as perceived by the unit of
adoption. A similar definition by Van de Ven regards innovation as “…a new idea which
may be a recombination of old ideas, a scheme that challenges the present order, a
formula, or a unique approach which is perceived new by the individuals involved” (Van
de Ven, 1986). Innovations have also been described as complex, non-linear processes,
which are influenced by the interplay of other innovations, societal trends, and individual
preferences (Kline, 2009).
These assertions imply that innovations do not manifest out of thin air or a production
line to be readily adoptable, but are subject to a complex course of social, cultural,
political, and ideological deconstruction and reconstruction before eventual adoption or
rejection may take place. These processes will be introduced in more detail in this chapter.

2.1 Technological determinism, social constructionism,
and socio-technical approaches
The paradigm of innovation and technology adoption studies has shifted profusely over
past decades. Initial innovation studies in the 1950s and 1960s were largely based on the
perspective that technology itself determines the course an organization will take in
developing its processes and operations (Banker & Kauffman, 2004). This perspective
follows in the tradition of social scientists such as Thorstein Veblen, who considered
technology to be the driving force behind ushering humanity into new eras from the stone
age to the industrial revolution and beyond. Veblen saw technology as the main
antecedent for capitalism stabilizing as an economic system in industrial countries, with
5

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

further technological advancements perpetuating this stabilization (Papageorgiou &
Michaelides, 2016).
The technological determinism paradigm was eventually challenged, giving way to the
social constructionist and actor-focused views into innovation and technology adoption
research. This can be observed as early as in the early 1970s in the writings of
organizational theorists such as Rosemary Stewart, who noted that in some cases
computerization resulted in extra work for managers as opposed to convenience and task
automation. Stewart hypothesized this to be the result of more layers of influence within
an organization besides technology itself (Stewart, 1971). This change of focus happened
concurrently with similar larger trends in IS research. Personal computing technology
changed many workplaces throughout the 1980s, and subsequently the individual or
“user” became the main unit of study (Banker & Kauffman, 2004). Famous examples of
this paradigm are Fishbein and Azjen’s Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Davis’
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), both of which have since undergone various
revisions. These theories aim to predict adoption based on attitudes towards behavior and
perceptions towards usefulness and ease of use, respectively (Davis, 1989; Fishbein,
1975). While widely cited in IS literature, these theories have also come under scrutiny
due to focusing heavily on individual actors while neglecting the wider social context in
which these actors operate (Laurila & Preece, 2003). This is especially true in an
organizational context, where social networks and power relationships between actors
present a strong impetus for technology adoption or rejection (Burkhardt & Brass, 2016).
Post-structuralist research approaches have emerged to offer a hybrid perspective into
diffusion and adoption. These socio-technical views attempt to strike a balance between
the materiality of technological determinism studies and the holistic viewpoint of social
constructionism. Instead of favoring either technology or social context as an independent
variable towards one another, a socio-technical approach sees the innovation process as
a complex structure of technological artifact characteristics and individual preferences
which in turn are governed by a wider socio-technical frame (Flichy, 2007, 165). This has
implications for organizational adoption studies: as each organization is different,
synthesizing a general model for organizational technology adoption may prove to be a
fool’s errand. However, a hybrid socio-technical angle may provide insight into the inner
mechanisms and intangible assets of an organization such as human capital,

6

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

communication networks, capabilities, and the transformation of these elements over time
(McLoughlin & Dawson, 2003).

2.2 Innovation as a driver for change
While a multitude of approaches to innovation research exist, it can also be argued that
the innovation itself consists of many layers, some of which are more prone to external
social configurations than others. As such, a single research paradigm may not be able to
cover the entirety of the innovation. To illustrate this, Frank W. Geels presents a lifecycle
model of innovation, based on his earlier work on technological transitions (Elzen, Geels,
& Green, 2004, 38). In this chapter, the new library system in deconstructed in accordance
with the model to provide a scope for where the study of its innovation characteristics lies
in the integrated multi-level view.

Figure 1 A dynamic multi-level perspective on system innovation (Geels 2004).

7

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

Geels contends that the innovation process is initiated by radical novelties or incremental
changes to existing technologies, ideas, and practices. In the case of the new library
system, the technological niche includes both the existing library system and the social
groups involved in creating, using, and distributing the system. Innovation can thus be
initiated by any of these characters or, most commonly, as a result of the interplay
between them (Elzen et al., 2004). At first separate and disjointed, these novelties can be
considered as singular system innovation elements. In the case of a new library system,
these incremental innovations can involve new workflows, APIs to other systems,
metadata repositories, etc. These individual processes then converge into a single
configuration. In this case, the configuration is the new library system as a product,
containing all the articulation processes in a single package.
The new configuration is then introduced into the existing socio-technical regime. The
introduction is dependent on a window of opportunity emerging from the regime to adopt
the innovation. The consortium of Lumikko libraries can thus be considered a sociotechnical regime. The new artifact engages in competition with the values, perceptions,
and attitudes of the present regime. The window of opportunity is influenced by macrolevel landscape developments. For Lumikko libraries, the landscape includes both their
immediate surrounding organizations and the Finnish society. For example, a government
policy to alter university funding may cause changes to the proceedings of individual
units within universities, such as libraries.
The landscape also includes the expansive sociocultural and technological environment
in which the organization operates. Digitalization has enabled a new paradigm of selfefficacy in the availability of information, where user needs have become much more
demanding and specialized. Responding to this change is especially important for
memory organizations such as libraries, as alternative channels to obtain information have
become more frequent (Moran, 2013, p. 45). The change management process for
Lumikko libraries can be perceived as a response to these landscape changes. This
response in turns triggers another, internal wave of change within the Lumikko libraries.
For internal change, employee empowerment, buy-in, participatory culture, and choosing
suitable change agents are imperative. Change agents should listen to and observe the
employees’ worries regarding change, while simultaneously instructing them to question

8

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

the status quo of the organization and discover areas of improvement (Moran, 2013, p.
53).

2.3 Social construction of technology
The hybrid approach presented in the previous sub-chapter has been outlined by Bijker
in his conceptual framework for the social construction of technology (SCOT). While
some studies make a semantic distinction between Bijker’s earlier and latter revisions of
the framework with the respective acronyms SCOT and SCOT2, this thesis only refers to
the newer revision using the acronym SCOT for consistency and readability. Bijker
endeavored to establish SCOT as a generalized theory of technological development
(Bijker, 1995, p. 13). In order to establish this, SCOT recognizes relevant social groups,
interpretive flexibility, and technological frames as concepts of interest.

2.3.1 Relevant social groups and interpretive flexibility
According to SCOT, relevant social groups are groups of actors who are connected by a
shared perception of the problems and possible solutions that can be provided by a
technological artifact (Bijker, 1995, p. 50). In the Lumikko project, three major social
groups can be readily observed: the librarians migrating into a new system, the library
system provider, and the library patrons. Each of these groups has a different set of
problems, and the artifact of the library system is a possible solution to those problems.
For the system vendor, an example of a problem is increased competition in the SaaS
market: vendors cannot control their clients’ switching costs, making service quality and
functionality paramount (Ma & Kauffman, 2014). As an example of a solution related to
this problem, the new library system offers robust REST API functions to transfer data
objects between the library system and 3rd party systems such as ERP systems, student
registries, and vendor purchasing systems. This enables the system to interface with
various configurations in different organizations, which in turn provides a solution to a
client-side problem: staff in the Lumikko libraries required new tools to streamline
workflows, harmonize and consolidate systems, and lower operating costs.
However, focusing solely on what is immediately observable neglects those actors within
the social groups who may be unable to voice their opinion due to organizational power
structures or mis- or underrepresentation (Bijker, 1995, p. 49). For instance, it is

9

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

disingenuous to portray librarians as a single homogenous unit, wherein all actors share
an identical problem-solution paradigm. Nevertheless, organizations are often used as the
unit of analysis without consideration for the differences in their employees’ attitudes
(Green, Wu, Whitten, & Medlin, 2006).

2.3.2 Technological frames
When the interpretive flexibility of an innovation decreases, a single interpretation of the
innovation becomes its de facto representation. Bijker refers to these processes as closure
and stabilization. Essentially, one social group’s perception becomes the de facto
meaning for the artifact. Orlikowski and Gash suggested the notion of technological
frames as a conceptual framework for studying the socio-cognitive processes towards
technological artifacts. These include assumptions, expectations, and knowledge towards
technology that are held by a certain social group or community (Orlikowski & Gash,
1994). Their approach was not entirely novel, as similar phenomena has been described
with concepts such as interpretive frames, mental models, and paradigms in cognitive
psychology. Orlikowski and Gash argue that technological frames are implicit sensemaking and decision-making devices in organizations. If several incongruent frames exist
within an organization, it may impede the introduction of new technological innovations.
Conversely, congruent technological frames assist the dissemination and adoption of
technology. Bijker attests that the success of an innovation is dependent on several
congruent frames coming together, with one group enrolling others into supporting it
(Bijker, 1995, pp. 277–278). In conclusion, it should be noted that technological frames
are essentially a social process – not existing within individuals, but rather constructed at
the level of a social group by its members (Bijker, 1995, p. 193).

2.4 Innovation characteristics
Rogers suggests a set of measurable innovation characteristics as a method of predicting
the rate of innovation adoption on an individual or organization level. The innovation
characteristics approach emphasizes the influence of subjective factors on behavior
towards innovations, such as previous experiences and behavioral norms. Rogers asserts
that a majority of variance in the rate of innovation adoption can be explained by five

10

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

innovation characteristics: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and
observability (Rogers, 2003, 223).

Relative advantage
Relative advantage refers to the degree in which the subject believes the innovation to be
an improvement over the idea or product which preceded it (Rogers, 2003, 231). As a
construct, relative advantage bears a resemblance to the concept of Perceived Usefulness
in Davis’ Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989). Both constructs have
been criticized for being too general, as perceptions of advantage can be highly
subjective: easier task management, improved status among peers, and economical
factors are all similarly valid examples of perceived relative advantage or usefulness. To
counter this, an innovation’s perceived effect on its user’s social status is often separated
into its own construct. In developing their highly influential instrument for measuring
perceived innovation characteristics, Moore & Benbasat suggested the additional
innovation characteristic of image to assess these perceptions (Moore & Benbasat, 1991).
Rogers generalized relative advantage to be positively correlated with innovation
adoption rate (Rogers, 2003, 233). This hypothesis has been largely supported by a great
number of studies. A 2014 meta-analysis of over 200 studies utilizing the innovation
characteristics approach found relative advantage to be a statistically significant
antecedent to both adoption and intention to adopt an innovation (Kapoor, Dwivedi, &
Williams, 2014).

Compatibility
Compatibility can be described as the degree in which an innovation is perceived as
consistent by the values, past experiences, and needs of the user. As such, compatibility
is highly influenced by behavioral norms on a societal or organizational level in addition
to individual attributes (Rogers, 2003, 240). As with relative advantage, the construct of
compatibility has attracted criticism: in developing their instrument, Moore & Benbasat
considered user needs to be a component of relative advantage, as opposed to
compatibility (Moore & Benbasat, 1991). Subsequently, studies built around the Moore
& Benbasat instrument measure compatibility as the aggregate of sociocultural values

11

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

and previously introduced ideas contributing towards perceptions of an innovation.
However, the common practice of reusing measurements scales in innovation studies has
also resulted in a trend of compatibility being utilized as a catch-all term for “suitable
with one’s methods of work” while diminishing the contribution of social antecedents
influencing compatibility (Van Slyke, Johnson, Hightower, & Elgarah, 2008). Rogers
hypothesized compatibility to correlate positively with rate of adoption, and this
hypothesis has been supported to a significant degree in studies measuring innovation
characteristics (Kapoor et al., 2014).

Complexity
Complexity is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand
and use (Rogers, 2003, p. 257). As with relative advantage, the construct can be viewed
as a counterpart to the similar concept of Perceived Ease of Use in TAM (Davis, 1989).
While Rogers regarded complexity to be less significant of a predictor for rate of adoption
than relative advantage and compatibility, past studies have indicated that increased
complexity is negatively correlated with intention to adopt (Kapoor et al., 2014). While
personal innovativeness in information technology (PIIT) has been observed to moderate
Perceived Ease of Use in technology acceptance studies (Jackson, Yi, & Park, 2013;
Amoroso & Lim, 2015), the connection between PIIT and perceived complexity is far
less studied.

Trialability
Trialability is the degree to which the innovation is available for testing, experimentation,
and familiarization before a decision to adopt or reject is made (Rogers, 2003, p. 258).
Rogers theorized a positive link between trialability and rate of adoption. Most studies
involving trialability have been predictive in nature, in contrast to the more common
retrospective method of examining perceived innovation characteristics and adoption
(Kapoor et al., 2014). For the purposes of this study, the construct of trialability will
focus on the period of testing done on the new system’s sandbox during the
implementation phase.

12

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

Observability
Observability refers to the degree to which the results of using an innovation are visible
and communicable to others (Rogers, 2003, p. 258). Moore & Benbasat problematized
this approach and argued that this construct measured two separate dimensions: the
degree to which the results of using an innovation are tangible and communicable, and
the degree to which using the innovation is literally visible for the individual in their
environment, such as seen in use by their colleagues (Moore & Benbasat, 1991). This
deconstruction resulted in the respective constructs of result demonstrability and
visibility.

Voluntariness
While voluntariness was not considered by Rogers to be an innovation characteristic per
se, he theorized the existence of several categories of innovation-decision types which
would factor into the rate of adoption. Rogers identified three main innovation-decision
types (Rogers, 2003, p. 403):
-

Optional: the decision to adopt or reject an innovation is dependent on the
individual’s choice.

-

Collective: the decision to adopt or reject an innovation is made in consensus by
members of a system, after which all members are expected to act according to
the decision.

-

Authority: the decision to adopt or reject an innovation is made by a relatively
small number of people with influence and power, and those lower in the power
hierarchy are expected to comply.

Additionally, Rogers introduced contingent innovation-decision types as decision
processes which include two or more outcomes in a sequence, with later decisions in the
sequence being dependent on the earlier decisions (Rogers, 2003, p. 403). In a modern
information workplace setting, individual employees are commonly mandated to use
specific innovations or systems from above.
The Lumikko project organization’s decision to adopt the new library system can be
perceived as a contingent innovation-decision: in the planning stages, representatives of
the libraries congregated to make a collective decision to adopt the new system. These

13

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

libraries in turn would introduce the new system to their employees, conforming to the
authoritarian innovation-decision type.
Moore & Benbasat concluded that even if the decision to adopt an innovation is mandated
from above, there are gradients to individual levels of perceived voluntariness.
Accordingly, the construct of voluntariness was itemized in their instrument (Moore &
Benbasat, 1991).

2.5 Innovativeness as a personal attribute
The degree to which individuals themselves are relatively earlier to adopt innovations
than other members of their system has similarly been a subject of study. Even the early
adoption studies distinguished individual characteristics such as metropoliteness and
higher levels of education as early adopter traits (Deutschman & Borda, 1995).
Models such as TAM present individual attitudes as a mediating variable between
perceived usefulness, ease of use, and intention to use a technology. While this approach
accounts for individual affect, it fails to provide insight as to how these attitudes are
formed. Agarwal and Prasad presented the idea of appropriating the concept of personal
innovativeness from previous diffusion and social psychology literature and
instrumentalizing it for use in an information technology context (Agarwal & Prasad,
1998). The resultant construct was titled personal innovativeness in information
technology (PIIT). Agarwal and Prasad introduced four items to measure the degree of
PIIT, and suggested its use in examining the moderating and mediating effects of PIIT on
information technology use (Agarwal & Prasad, 1998).
The PIIT concept differs from other commonly used user-administered assessments in
that it does not measure self-efficacy, ie. the individual’s perception on whether they are
adept at using an information technology. Instead, PIIT focuses on the individual’s
willingness to engage and experiment with new information technology. It can be argued
that despite its subjective nature, PIIT may in fact provide a more comparable result of
individual attitudes towards information technology than self-efficacy constructs due to
respondents often under- or overestimating their levels of self-efficacy (Keil, 2002).

14

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

2.6 Criticism of innovation studies
Diffusion of innovation theory has also been the target of scrutiny, especially since the
2000s onwards. Fougère and Harding argue that the concept of “diffusion” naturalizes
innovation as something innately positive and progressive which is delivered from the
Western world into the “less developed non-West” (Fougère & Harding, 2012). The
assertion is that innovation itself is the product of Western academia, and as such its
diffusion cannot be studied on universal terms but rather on a sociocultural level. Even
during the Enlightenment, innovators were considered dissidents and opponents of the
current governing institutions. It took until the 20th century to herald innovation as a
relational concept to creativity and originality in scientific literature (Godin, 2012).
Another aspect of criticism for innovation studies has been their tendency to ignore the
negative consequences of innovations. Innovation studies often focus on organizations as
the level of analysis, instead of individual employees. The general perspective of these
studies is that innovations categorically improve the employees’ well-being and work
performance, even though change affects each individual on a different scale – for some,
it may cause a great deal of stress. The degree of autonomy and control over an
individual’s work has been found to be related to their position at the organization, with
employees reporting more negative effects than managers (Cañibano, Basilio, & Sánchez,
2012).

3 RESEARCH DESIGN
While the relationship between perceived innovation characteristics and intention to
adopt has been widely studied, the correlations between sociodemographic variables and
perceived innovation characteristics in an organizational setting have been subject to less
academic inquiry. Similarly, organizational adoption studies tend to forego the subjective
experience of voluntariness in examining mandated adoption (Gallivan, 2001). This study
suggests an approach where both personal innovativeness and sociodemographic
background variables are utilized as potential predictors of perceived innovation
characteristics. These perceptions can then be analysed in an organizational (or rather,
consortium-wide) context to possibly identify various types of users in an effort to tailor
change management practices towards these user types. The three research questions are
as follows:
RQ1: How do sociodemographic variables predict perceived innovation characteristics?
RQ2: Does personal innovativeness have a mediating effect on perceived innovation
characteristics?
RQ3: Based on the data, what inferences can be made of the state of interpretive
flexibility and technological frames in participating Lumikko libraries?

Figure 2 Conceptual research model

16

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

Building upon the literature review, four sociodemographic background variables are
used as independent variables. Rogers generalized that individuals with higher levels of
education and socioeconomic status have more contact with change agents, and thus are
more innovative (Rogers, 2003, p. 308). Additionally, Rogers asserted that the level of
“metropoliteness” exhibited by an individual is positively correlated to their degree of
opinion leadership (Rogers, 2003, p. 317). As such, the level of education and current
position in the library were included in the research design. The amount of years spent
working as a librarian is included as a measure of experience, since experienced and
inexperienced users have been observed to perceive innovation characteristics differently
(Liao & Lu, 2008). While organization size alone has not conclusively been found as a
predictor of IT adoption, it is often contingent on moderating variables (Lee & Xia, 2006).
Due to this, the distinction between small-to-medium size libraries and large libraries is
used in this study.
Age and gender were initially considered for inclusion as demographic variables.
However, the literature review provided conflicting results on the actual influence of these
variables. Some studies found them statistically significant (Ilie, Van Slyke, Green, &
Lou, 2005; Teo & Lim, 1996), while others did not (Chung, 2014; Kademeteme &
Twinomurinzi, 2019). It could also be argued that gender as a variable is highly subjective
to landscape developments, such as the level of gender equality in the location where the
study takes place. Furthermore, the inclusion of such personal data could have
jeopardized respondent anonymity, especially in smaller libraries.
In order to provide answers for the research questions, a two-tiered research methodology
is applied. The first tier of analysis involves a principal component analysis utilizing data
from a questionnaire built around measuring Rogersian innovation characteristics and
personal innovation. PCA was chosen as the method of analysis due to Rogers’ assertion
that each innovation should be examined as its own entity, with reservations towards
standardized measurement instruments (Rogers, 2003, p. 225). The choice was also
informed by the criticism leveled at diffusion studies in Chapter 2.6: as the focus of the
study is on differences between groups of individuals, it was considered important to
question the standardized instrument often used in organizational innovation studies. The
second tier of analysis consists of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
sociodemographic variables as independent variables and the latent variables as

17

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

dependent variables. The main measure of interest is the effect size, referring to the
amount of variance explained by the relationship between variables (Singh, 2007).

3.1 The questionnaire
The questionnaire was initially modeled after the aforementioned Moore & Benbasat
instrument. However, some individual items were altered in phrasing, wording, or general
content. This approach was supported by Rogers’ assertion of innovation attributes
varying on a case-by-case basis, necessitating some level of tailoring for individual items
(Rogers, 2003, 225). During the literature review, a sample of 30 studies utilizing
Rogersian innovation characteristics as dependent variables were examined for their item
wording and content (Appendix A).
The most notable itemization changes were done on items measuring the compatibility
construct. Only one item measuring work task compatibility was used, with the addition
of one item measuring compatibility with personal values and one item measuring
compatibility with organizational values. This emphasis on social compatibility was
based on criticism towards the Moore & Benbasat instrument, as exemplified in chapter
2.4.2. None of the 30 studies examined for the questionnaire included items measuring
social compatibility as part of the compatibility construct, further reinforcing this
decision. In addition to the Rogersian variables, the construct of personal innovativeness
was itemized in accordance to the Agarwal and Prasad PIIT concept.
The final instrument consisted of 4 background questions and 26 items representing 9
constructs (Appendix B). Because the background questions involved indirect personal
information, a privacy notice was included in the questionnaire to inform the participants
of how the data was going to be used. The items were measured on a 5-point bipolar
Likert scale measuring from 1 (disagree completely) to 5 (agree completely). While a 7point scale is sometimes applied for more granularity, for the purposes of this study a 5point scale was considered sufficient. This was done to counter respondent confusion in
regards to vague quantifiers, especially since the measured constructs were rather abstract
in nature (Dillman, 2014). For the same reason, no reverse scale items were used in the
questionnaire. As the majority of the population was Finnish speaking, the questionnaire
items were translated into Finnish. The Language Center was consulted during the
translation process to ensure that construct validity remained intact.
18

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

The questionnaire was administered via a Google Forms survey, which was open to
responses for 2,5 weeks between February and March 2020. The link to the questionnaire
was distributed to the project managers in each of the 8 participating libraries in the first
implementation wave of the new library system, who in turn distributed the questionnaire
within their respective organizations. The total population of the study was approximately
330 library employees, based on 2018 statistical data on higher education libraries (KITT
2020).

Out of all the responses, 22 were from employees of small to medium sized libraries
(under 30 employees) and 75 were from employees of large libraries (over 30 employees).

Figure 3 Frequency distribution of respondents' work experience in the library field measured in

The work experience of respondents in the sample (N = 97) approached a normal
distribution, with a sample mean value of 𝑥 = 19.39 years and sample standard deviation
of s = 10.67 years spent working in libraries.

4.1 Principal component analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory statistical procedure which aims to
reduce a larger number of total variables into smaller components. It is commonly used
to test out questionnaire items and deducing whether multiple quantitative variables
represent the larger constructs that they are intended to measure. The function of the
procedure is to find solutions which explain the largest amount of variance in the data.

21

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

These solutions are then arranged into constructs in order of magnitude of explained
variance. The constructs are commonly called factors (Keho, 2012).
First, the questionnaire scales representing constructs were examined for internal
consistency. The intention of the procedure was to estimate reliability of scales, in other
words confirming that the individual items in a group are measuring the same
phenomenon. This measure of reliability is often gauged by a coefficient known as
Cronbach’s alpha, with higher values representing stronger reliability (UCLA, 2020).

Table 4 Initial results of scale reliability testing

While several interpretations of acceptable alpha values exist, in social sciences alpha
values larger than 0.6-0.7 are generally considered viable (Tavakol & Dennick, 2011).
The scales used to measure trialability, visibility, and voluntariness fall short of this limit
and were thus omitted from subsequent statistical tests. It should be noted that Cronbach’s
alpha is sensitive to changes in the size of item scale, with alpha increasing in tandem
with the number of items in the scale (Akrout, 2018). Due to this, scores from these three
scales will be examined in terms of general descriptive statistics in Chapter 4.4.

4.1.1 Initial PCA
The first PCA was performed with a total of 20 items, after the items measuring
trialability, visibility, and voluntariness were omitted. Based on the literature review
(Kapoor et al., 2014), it was assumed that the latent variables would have at least some
level of correlation with one another. Due to this, a rotation was used in the initial PCA.
Essentially, rotational methods aim to discover the simplest possible solution in the data
to explain the maximum amount of variance (Brown, 2009). Rotational methods fall into
two main categories: orthogonal methods assume no correlations between factors, while

22

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

oblique methods assume a correlation between factors. For this study, the oblique promax
rotation was used.

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

The initial PCA discovered 4 components with an Eigenvalue greater than 1. Eigenvalue
is representative of the total amount of variance in the entire data that is explained by the
component. Any component with an Eigenvalue > 1 explains more variance than a single
observed variable (Keho, 2012). In total, the four components explained nearly 70 percent
of variance in the observed variables, which is above the suggested threshold of 60
percent for meaningful analysis (Hair, Black, & Babin, 2017).

Table 7 Initial factor loadings of observed variables, only coefficients larger than 0.3 are presented.

Next, the pattern matrix was studied to observe the correlation coefficients between each
observed variable and the components. Interestingly, examining the initial factor loadings
suggests the presence of a single construct explaining for relative advantage, complexity,
and to a degree, compatibility. Additionally, items on the compatibility scale which were
intended to measure compatibility with values loaded to the same construct as items
measuring perceived image. Item RD1 cross-loaded onto two components.
The heavy loadings on a single factor were considered indicative of collinearity in the
data. Collinearity is a result of observed variables being highly correlated with other: in
other words, the individual items may be measuring the same thing. Collinearity was

24

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

identified by examining the determinant value of the correlation matrix. The determinant
can be calculated as the product of all Eigenvalues extracted from the data (Appendix C).
The determinant value was 7.828E-7, which was smaller than the necessary value of
0.00001 (Field, 2005).

4.1.2 Final PCA
Further steps were taken to improve both factor loadings and the determinant value. The
cross-loaded variables were removed. However, even after this the determinant value was
below the acceptable level at 8.212E-6. Another adjustment was thus made by removing
the variable with the lowest factor loading, this being CX4 with a correlation coefficient
of 0.45. This change yielded a determinant value of 2.189E-5, which was above the
required determinant threshold. This adjustment also improved the total variance
explained by the model from approximately 69 percent to nearly 74 percent. After these
modifications, the pattern matrix identified four clearly separate constructs.

Table 8 Final factor loadings of observed variables, only coefficients larger than 0.3 are presented

Items from the relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility scales still loaded onto
a single factor. This is in stark contrast to Moore & Benbasat’s findings, where these
domains were clearly distinguishable from one another. For this study, this factor is
subsequently referred to as user-perceived usability. This definition was inspired by the
taxonomy presented by McGee et al, (McGee, Rich, & Dumas, 2004) in which user

25

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

perceptions are separated into domains of usability and satisfaction qualities. The
usability taxonomy includes traits such as “beneficial for problem solving”, “easy to

advantage,

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy is a composite score of
the proportion of variance in the variables which might be explained by underlying
factors. The score can be interpreted as the viability of the data set to be used in a factor
analysis As a general guideline, the KMO value should be at least 0.6 with greater values
displaying improved sampling adequacy (Chan & Idris, 2017). Bartlett’s Test of
Sphericity tests for correlations between variables for general factor analysis
compatibility. The sample passes the test, as this figure is well below the .05 significance
level (SPSS only displays the first three decimals in the results window).
Finally, the correlations between the factors themselves were examined to ensure that a
proper type of rotation was applied.

Table 11 Final correlation coefficients between factors

As seen in the matrix, a moderate correlation exists between factor 1 and factor 3.
Correlation values above 0.32 in the data suggest that the components are sufficiently
correlated for an oblique rotational method (Brown, 2009). This validates the use of an
oblique promax rotation for the data set. After passing these tests, it was concluded that
the factors derived from the data set would be suitable for ANOVA and regression
analysis. For these analyses, four new composite scores for the factors were computed
using the mean values from responses to items in each scale: usability, personal
innovativeness, result demonstrability, and image.

4.2 ANOVA and regression analysis
ANOVA refers to a set of statistical techniques which are used to measure differences
between the mean values of groups and the effect size of these differences (Geert van der
Berg, 2020) . ANOVA allows the use of categorical variables such as level of education
as variables in regression analysis. Regression analysis is a method which examines the
relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Satisfactory regression models can be used to predict changes in the dependent variable
by altering the independent variable’s parameters (Anderson & Sweeney, 2020).
ANOVA testing assumes that the residual terms of the variables are normally distributed.
Residuals refer to the difference between the observed value and the predicted value of
the variable (Anderson & Sweeney, 2020). In other words, it can be described as the
distance between the observation and the regression line. The four composite mean
factors were subjected to normality testing. The dependent variables were standardized
to examine normality through histograms.
It should be noted that according to the central limit theorem, sample sizes over 30 trend
increasingly towards normality (Klaubert, 2015). Normality tests are thus more
appropriate for smaller sample sizes. With the except of the image factor, all the

27

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

dependent variables displayed a normal distribution (Appendix D). The image construct
was nevertheless included in testing, however perceptions on image will be discussed
more in terms of general descriptive statistics.

4.2.1 Level of education
The highest level of education reported by the respondents was divided into four
categories: secondary education, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and doctoral degree.
As level of education is a categorical variable, it was dummy coded to enable one-way
ANOVA testing. Dummy coding refers to the process of creating new dichotomous
variables based on the existing categories of the observed variable. Level of education
was coded in the following manner:

Looking at the result matrix (Table 13), we can observe differences between groups. The
column for B represents the unstandardized coefficient value: for the constant (secondary
education), this is the mean value for all respondents in the secondary education group.
For the other groups, this value represents the difference in mean response score for that
group in comparison to the secondary education group.
For perceived usability, two relationship were identified under the α 0.05 significance
level: the difference between bachelor’s degree holders and the reference group and the
difference between doctoral degree holders and the reference group. The latter is notable
in that the mean difference between the groups was over 1, which is notable considering
that the responses were on a 5-point Likert scale. In result demonstrability, the mean
differences between groups were more even. Again, the difference between bachelor’s
degree holders and secondary educated employees was under the significance level. The
differences between group perceptions towards the image factor were practically nonexistent in both terms of mean difference and significance. As mentioned previously, this
was expected due to the lack of normality in the variable.
The relationship between level of education and personal innovativeness was more
pronounced. Both bachelor’s degree and master’s degree holders had a significant
difference in comparison to the reference group. Interestingly, doctoral degree holders
were less innovative than any other group. However, this observation is well above the
significance level and most likely due to a small sample size of respondents in this group.

effect, and over 0,14 for a large effect. The effect size of level of education was on the

(p < 0.05) are highlighted in bold.

The employee’s position at their library matrix (Table 16) displays a lesser degree of
mean difference and significance than the level of education comparisons. Staff members
in managerial positions reported a higher degree of perceived usability, albeit slightly
above the significance level. Group perceptions towards result demonstrability varied in
very small amounts, with managers reporting a slightly higher average score. Group
differences towards the image factor were negligible. However, personal innovativeness
was affected by the respondents’ position at the library. Both experts and managers
reported a higher level of personal innovativeness than employees, with the former
difference being below the significance level.

Overall, the effect size of the staff member’s position at the library was smaller than the

4.2.3 Library size
Respondents could report being employed in a small-to-medium (less than 30 employees)
or a large library (30 or more employees). The variable is dichotomous by default, so no
dummy coding was necessary. Small-to-medium size libraries were used as the reference
value.

Table 18 One-way ANOVA test results for library size.

The differences in both perceptions and personal innovativeness between employees in
small-to-medium and large libraries was practically non-existent. The type of the
organization has been identified as a mediating factor in previous studies, with non-profit
organizations not benefiting from organization size in adoption processes when compared
to businesses and private companies (Lee & Xia, 2006). Similar observations can be made
from the results obtained in this sample.

In addition, the effect size of organization size is negligible. It appears that for this sample,

innovation.

4.2.4 Work experience in the library field
Work experience was measured on a continuous scale, thus regular linear regression was
used in its analysis. Pearson’s r was examined for direction and strength of correlation
between variables and the coefficient of determination r2 was observed for effect size.

Table 20 Correlation coefficients and effect size between work experience in the library field and the
dependent variables.

The correlation between perceived usability, result demonstrability, and image was
negligible. However, a significant negative correlation was observed between work
experience and perceived usability. As work experience increases, the perceived usability
decreases. The correlation itself is low-to-medium with r = -0.35 and the effect size is
low at r2 = 0.12 (Ferguson, 2009). While the mean usability score for staff members with
more work experience is lower, the total amount of variance is distributed more evenly
around the mean of each level of experience (Figure 4).

4.3 Personal innovativeness as a mediating variable
Mediation refers to the degree in which the relationship between two variables is affected
by a third variable. Effectively, mediation is the indirect effect between the two variables
that can be attributed to the mediator (MacKinnon, 2012). A simple mediation model is
presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Single mediator model (not displaying error terms)

33

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

The direct effect between the independent and dependent variable is the value of path c.
The indirect effect is the product between paths a x b. The total effect is the sum of both,
ab + c. The mediation analysis was performed via the SPSS PROCESS macro, which
outputs both a total effect model and indirect effect model. The mediating effect of
personal innovativeness was tested, starting out with level of education as the dependent
variable. As the dependent variable is categorical, the difference between the constant
and each category is presented as its own path (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Illustrative model of mediation with non-standardized direct and indirect path coefficients.

The same values were used as the constant as in the previous ANOVA analysis. In other
words, in Figure 6 secondary education functions as the baseline, X1 refers to the
difference between the baseline and bachelor’s degree holders, X2 to the difference
between the baseline and master’s degree holders, and X3 to the difference between the
baseline and doctoral degree holders. Examining the PROCESS output provides us with
the indirect effect of each mediation path, along with a confidence interval. The
confidence interval can be used for significance testing. If the interval excludes zero, the
mediation effect can be considered statistically significant (MacKinnon, 2012).
The PROCESS output from the model in Figure 6 produced the following indirect effects:

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

The two rightmost columns of the output refer to the lower and upper limit of the
estimated confidence interval (LLCI and ULCI respectively). Examining the results, we
can observe that for X1 and X2 the bootstrapped confidence intervals do not contain zero.
From this, we can conclude that the differences in perceptions towards usability between
both secondary educated staff members and bachelor’s degree holder and secondary
educated staff members and master’s degree holders are significantly mediated by
personal innovativeness. The effect size of the mediation can be calculated as the
proportion of the indirect effect out of the total effect (as displayed by the B value in Table
13). X1 effect size is thus 0.1615 / 0.7073 = 0.23 and X2 effect size = 0.1958 / 0.43. As
such, the mediating effect of personal innovativeness is 23% of the total effect for X1 and
43% of the total effect for X2.

Table 21 Indirect effects of personal innovativeness on the relationship between level of education
group differences and the dependent variables. Significant effects are highlighted in bold.

While level of education did have a significant effect on result demonstrability for
bachelor’s degree holders (Table 13), it appears that personal innovativeness did not
mediate this effect to a significant degree. Interestingly, for the difference between
doctoral degree holders and the secondary educated, personal innovativeness had a
moderate suppressing effect on both perceptions towards usability and image, albeit not
a significant one. The other relationships between level of education and the dependent
variables displayed only very small and insignificant mediator effects.

As expected, based on the results from previous testing, the mediating effect of personal
innovativeness was practically non-existent between libraries of different sizes.
Additionally, the difference between personal innovativeness scores from respondents
from small-to-medium sized libraries (𝑥 = 3.02 s = 0.84) and large libraries (𝑥 = 2.88 s =
0.85) suggests that there is no discernable distinction in personal innovativeness between
staff in small-to-medium and large libraries.

Finally, mediation for work experience in the library field was tested (Table 24). Again,
the mediation effect was practically non-existent. Interestingly, the significant negative
correlation between work experience and perceived usability is not at all mediated by
personal innovativeness. This implies that work experience itself is a significant predictor
of perceptions towards usability.

Table 25 Sample mean and sample standard deviation table for voluntariness, visibility, and
trialability.

In addition to the independent variables presented in Table 25, the effect of work
experience on the three dependent characteristics was examined. However, no significant
correlations were distinguished. Overall, voluntariness scores were low in all cases. This
is somewhat expected, as the decision to adopt the new system was done collective-toauthoritarian contingent process. Additionally, library work tasks in a contemporary
setting require the use of a library system without the possibility of opting out of system
use. This may also explain the fairly high visibility scores reported by respondents: legacy
37

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

system usage was no longer possible when the new system went live, increasing visibility
for the new system by default. Mean trialability scores were above neutral, suggesting
that for the most part librarians felt like they had enough time to test the new system.
However, there is a noticeable amount of variance within respondent groups towards
visibility and trialability, as evidenced by the high standard deviation. Due to this, an ad
hoc test was performed to test for PIIT mediation for these two characteristics.
The test showed no significant mediation between any dependent variables and visibility.
However, the relationship between level of education and trialability were mediated to a
great extent by personal innovativeness. The difference between secondary educated staff
members and bachelor’s degree holders (B = 0.383) was affected by a significant (LLCI
= 0.012 ULCI = 0.376) indirect effect (B = 0.158), with a total effect size of 0.158 / (0.158
+ 0.225) x 100 = 41 %. Furthermore, the difference between secondary educated staff
members and master’s degree holders (B = 0.181) had a significant (LLCI = 0.024 ULCI
= 0.409) indirect effect (B = 0.1917). The absolute value of the direct effect was 0.0104,
thus the effect size is 0.1917 / (0.1917 + 0.0104) x 100 = 95 %. In other words, this
relationship is almost entirely mediated by personal innovativeness.

38

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

5 DISCUSSION
Based on the sample, we can conclude the following regarding the research questions:
RQ1: How do sociodemographic variables predict perceived innovation characteristics?
Level of education predicts perceived usability for bachelor’s degree and doctoral degree
holders with a medium effect size, result demonstrability for bachelor’s degree holders
with a low effect size, and personal innovativeness for bachelor’s and master’s degree
holders with a medium to high effect size. Employment in an expert position predicts
personal innovativeness with a medium effect size. The amount of years spent working
at libraries is negatively correlated with perceived usability, with a low to medium effect
size. Library size does not predict perceptions towards innovation characteristics nor
personal innovativeness.
RQ2: Does personal innovativeness have a mediating effect on perceived innovation
characteristics?
Personal innovativeness mediates the relationship between level of education, perceived
usability, and perceived trialability for two groups: bachelor’s degree and master’s degree
holders. For perceived usability, the mediation effect accounted for 23% of the variance
in the former group and 43% of the variance in the latter group. For trialability, the
mediation effect accounted for 41% of the variance in the former group and 95% of the
variance in the latter group. Personal innovativeness had no other significant mediating
effects.
RQ3: Based on the data, what inferences can be made of the state of interpretive
flexibility and technological frames in participating Lumikko libraries?
Research question 3 will be addressed in more detail in chapter 5.2.

5.1 Limitations of the study
Several limitations were present in the study, which means that the results should be
considered exploratory at best. First, the sample size was small at N = 97. A general
recommendation for sample size is five observations per observed variable (Pallant,

39

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

2010). For 26 observed variables, a sample of at least 130 cases would have been
preferable. Second, the instrument itself should have been validated more thoroughly. At
least three items per scale would most likely have yielded a better Cronbach’s alpha and
allowed for more granularity in examining the research questions. However, this decision
was based on a literature review where two-item scales had been successfully used in
several studies (Appendix A).
Due to the small sample size and large body of literature applying the Moore and Benbasat
instrument, it can be argued that the results of the questionnaire could have been applied
in regression analysis directly without the PCA. The PCA approach was eventually
selected as both an attempt as a critical look into the use of standardized instrumentation
towards technological innovation and to function as a learning experience. While the PCA
found relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity to effectively represent the same
construct, the mean scores for these characteristics were also one-way ANOVA-tested
individually against level of education with the following results:

Table 26 One-way ANOVA test between level of education and the mean scores for individual
innovation characteristics (as opposed to the amalgamated usability construct).

Examining individual innovation characteristics, it appears that complexity accounts for
the largest amount of variance in the usability construct (Table 25). With a larger sample
size, it is possible that the differences between these characteristics would become more
pronounced and they could be identified as individual factors.
Finally, the timing of the study was problematic. The first implementation wave consisted
of only eight libraries, with the remaining libraries going live later during summer 2020.
Additionally, the system had been in use for only two months in the wave one libraries
before the questionnaire was administered, during which perceptions towards the new
system are still in flux. However, depending on perspective, this can also be viewed as an

40

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

advantage of studying in situ change in organizations instead of the more common
retrospective approach. This also allows for potential longitudinal studies in the future,
which will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

5.2 Implications of the study
Despite the limitations of the study, some inferences can be made based on the data.
Differences in perceived innovation characteristics between user demographics were not
very striking, which can be considered indicative of low interpretive flexibility. This is
evident in the low variance in perceived image between demographics: respondents
seemed to agree that the system’s biggest contribution was its operational capabilities
instead of perceived prestige or reputation associated with using the system. As
technological frame studies have been traditionally qualitative and labor-intensive, a
mixed-mode approach of both qualitative and quantitative methods have been suggested
in their study (Davidson, 2006). Based on the sample in this thesis, there may be some
merit to using quantitative methods as an exploratory tool to map out the potential
differences and their significance between groups within a population as part of the
research planning process.
Secondary educated staff members systematically scored their perceptions and personal
innovativeness lower than other groups. This may be indication that there is a separate
technological frame for this group, which may have more reservations to experiment with
new technologies as the other groups. The low innovativeness score reported by doctoral
degree holders (𝑥 = 2.44 s = 0.24) is similarly interesting: even though the sample size
for doctors is very small, there is also very little variance in the reported scores. However,
the low significance levels throughout the observations imply that while several
technological frames may exist within Lumikko libraries, they are mostly congruent with
one another. In cases such as these, aligning frames may not be required and may in fact
impose the dominant group’s frame into the organization in a non-organic fashion.
Instead, understanding the degree of flexibility, breadth, and complexity of the various
frames may assist change management more than just a process of realignment
(Davidson, 2006)
Another notable finding is managers reporting a higher usability and result
demonstrability score than other staff categories. This observation echoes the notion that
41

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

managers perceive more control over change as employees. On the other hand, there is
also significant relationship between bachelor’s degree holders and perceptions towards
result demonstrability. Out of all the 24 respondents from this group, 18 reported working
at an employee position (such as assistant librarian or library secretary). Employees tend
to perform many of the daily operative functions in the library, and hence often use the
system more than the other staff groups. The average result demonstrability score for this
group was well over neutral, which hints that even at the early stages of adoption the
system provides sufficient and communicable feedback to the user in an operative
context.
Within the usability construct, complexity was the most prevalent element. This may be
due to the novelty of the system, despite the evaluation period during which the system
sandbox was available for use. The perceptions towards complexity should constantly be
evaluated by the libraries. If these perceptions do not change in the future, it is possible
that overadoption has occurred. Overadoption refers to the adoption of an innovation
based on its individual attractive elements instead of rationally gauging the benefits it
provides as a whole (Rogers, 2003, p. 232). In the context of a library system, this could
manifest in some features and functionalities of the system going unused due to a lack of
understanding in how to exploit them for strategic or operational gain.
The negative correlation between the amount of years spent working at libraries and
perceived usability is similarly notable. This trend may be evident of uncertainty
avoidance and a preference to maintain the workflows, tasks, and processes which have
become familiar to the respondents over the years. Especially in information technology
driven expert work, the introduction of new technology may cause worry that the
expertise of the employee will become obsolete (Moran, 2013, p. 58). Additionally, the
frequency of technological changes may cause information overload and further anxiety.
Staff training post-change is often necessary to embolden employees and to reduce
uncertainty (Du Plessis & Mabunda, 2016). Depending on the type of library, this can be
approached from different perspectives.
While library size did not impact the staff members’ perceptions towards the new library
system, it has been observed to affect how academic libraries approach change
management. Smaller libraries have a higher frequency of using a combination of
approaches such as human resources approaches (staff training) and structural approaches

42

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

(realigning roles and restructuring processes), while larger libraries tend to favor a single
approach, most notably human resources (Yi, 2015). This implies that smaller
organizations may be more agile in methodologies towards change, which also makes
sense logistically: a smaller number of employees will most likely have a larger pool of
shared knowledge and a smaller distance between employees and managers. As such, a
bottom-up approach to training where employees themselves identify gaps in their
capabilities and communicate them to managers may be preferable for smaller libraries.
For larger libraries, the managers should identify key areas and employee groups where
training is required and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. In this
context, the individual employee may perceive a greater power distance between
themselves and the managers, which impedes articulating the need for specific training.
Due to this, a top-down approach to set up training may be more beneficial for larger
libraries. Intermediaries such as change agents and team leaders can be utilized to
communicate training needs between employees and management.
Based on the sample, it is clear that personal innovativeness is a crucial mediating factor
in how individuals perceive usability and especially trialability. As a result, it is important
for libraries to focus on innovativeness as the most desired attribute for change agents,
instead of solely focusing on the educational background or the staff member’s current
position at the library. Identifying innovativeness is a more difficult task for managers.
Some suggested attributes for innovativeness include creativity, autonomy, motivation,
flexibility, and the ability to observe (Cerinsek & Dolinsek, 2009). In libraries, these can
manifest in participation in projects to introduce new services, initiative in group
discussions, and quick learning of new tasks and processes. Teams can be a useful method
of both identifying innovative individuals and communicating domain-specific training
needs to management (Moran, 2013, p. 361).

5.3 Suggestions for future research
The results of the study can be utilized in future research in various ways, such as:
-

Repeating the study for the wave two libraries to augment the existing sample data
to provide a larger pool of responses for a PCA and greater granularity of results.

43

Wille-Mitja Haimila: Managing change using a socio-technical approach

-

In relation to the above, the questionnaire can be readministered to the wave one
libraries in a longitudinal study examining the changes that occur in innovation
characteristics over time, especially towards perceived complexity.

-

A comparative study using the innovation characteristics approach to examine
differences between the libraries who opted for the commercial library system and
the libraries who chose to use the open source library system software.

-

A study on how much, if at all, the switch from an on-site installed library system
to a SaaS based system has affected the internal processes in how the system is
administrated and operated.

-

Using a mixed-method approach to examine technological frames in libraries to
gain a deeper knowledge of whether incongruence exists (such as between
secondary educated and higher educated staff members).

In conclusion, the library staff perceptions towards innovation characteristics were
largely similar between demographic groups, suggesting that the libraries in the sample
were socially coherent. The effect of personal innovativeness is far-reaching, and
managers need to be able to identify innovativeness in individual employees to optimize
preparedness for change initiatives. On an organizational scale, smaller and larger
libraries may benefit from different approaches to change management and staff training.
Finally, employees with a long history of work experience at libraries and employees with
a lower level of education may need more support and time in familiarizing themselves
to using the system.
