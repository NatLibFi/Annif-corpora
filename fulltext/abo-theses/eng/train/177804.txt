Abstract:
Background: After more than a decade of studies regarding working memory (WM) training
programs, the evidence for their effectiveness is limited. The group-level transfer gains observed
are mostly restricted to task-specific near transfer, that is, improvements in untrained pre-post
tasks structurally similar to the trained one. At the same time, large inter-individual differences in
improvement levels have been observed. Understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon
is essential for the future of WM training programs, as this possibly allows for more effective,
individually tailored interventions, which could make the training program benefits more
prominent.
Methods: Eight individual characteristics (age, education, gender, WM baseline performance
level, strategy use, motivation, alertness and cognition-related beliefs) were analyzed for their
predictive role in task-specific near transfer gains using multiple regression analyses. The data
was obtained from a study by Fellman et al. (2020), where 113 young adults underwent a 12session long WM training program with a digit n-back task over the course of four weeks.
Results: Out of the eight variables, only WM baseline performance level was found to
significantly predict task-specific near transfer gains, so that a lower baseline level in the
beginning of training resulted in larger transfer gains.
Conclusion: The present results support the existence of a compensation effect, where
cognitively low-performing individuals show larger transfer gains, presumably because they have
more room to improve. In practice, this would indicate that WM training programs are possibly
most beneficial for those who have a weaker WM performance level to start with.

Abstrakt:
Bakgrund: Bevis från över ett årtionde av studier gällande arbetsminnesträningsprogram har
visat att programmens effektivitet är begränsad. De förbättringar som konstaterats på gruppnivå
innefattar till största del uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer, vilket inkluderar förbättringar i otränade
uppgifter som strukturellt är likadana som den tränade uppgiften. Samtidigt har man noterat stora
interindividuella skillnader i mängden förbättring. En förståelse för mekanismerna bakom detta
fenomen är centralt eftersom det kan bidra till utvecklandet av skräddarsydda och mera effektiva
träningsprogram.
Metoder: Åtta individuella karaktärsdrag (ålder, utbildning, kön, grundnivå på
arbetsminnesprestation, strategianvändning, motivation, vakenhetsnivå och kognitionsrelaterade
åsikter) analyserades som eventuella prediktorvariabler för uppgiftsspecifik nära transferförbättring med hjälp av multipla regressionsanalyser. Datat som analyserades erhölls från en
studie av Fellman et al. (2020), där 113 unga vuxna genomgick ett arbetsminnesträningsprogram
på 12 sessioner under loppet av fyra veckor. Träningsuppgiften var en sifferversion av n-back
testet.
Resultat: Av alla åtta prediktorvariabler så var det endast grundnivån på arbetsminnesprestation
som signifikant förutspådde den mängd uppgiftspecifik nära transfer deltagarna uppvisade. En
lägre grundnivå på arbetsminnesprestation förutspådde mera transfer.
Slutsats: Resultaten stöder förekomsten av en kompensationseffekt, där kognitivt
svagpresterande individer uppvisar mera transfer, eventuellt eftersom de har mera utrymme för
förbättring. I praktiken innebär detta att arbetsminnesträningsprogram möjligen är mest
gynnsamma för de individer som från början har en svagare arbetsminnesförmåga.

1. Introduction
Working memory (WM) is commonly described as one’s ability to temporarily store,
as well as manipulate information, and it is considered to play a significant role in many everyday
cognitive activities (Baddeley, 1992; Miyake & Shah, 1999). It has also been linked to abilities such
as reading comprehension (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980), language processing (Baddeley, 2003)
and reasoning (Baddeley, 1992). Ever since Jaeggi et al. (2008) reported that fluid intelligence
could be improved through WM training, numerous studies have been published with the aim of
exploring possible benefits of WM training regimes on cognitive abilities (Karbach & Verhaeghen,
2014; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Soveri, et al., 2017). However, recent meta-analyses show that far
transfer1 from the trained cognitive domain to another domain is either weak (Au et al., 2014;
Karbach & Verhaeghen, 2014) or non-existent (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Soveri et al., 2017).
Redick (2019) labels this process in the research field as the hype cycle of WM training, where the
initial hype from some studies showing positive results has been replaced by recently published
meta-analyses, holding almost no evidence for any kind of improvements on cognitive domains
different from the one being trained. What seem to be present, however, are moderate to strong
improvements on the trained task. Also, performance enhancement on tasks supposedly measuring
the same cognitive domain has been found, referred to as near transfer2. In other words, the
potential benefits of WM training seem not to consist of far transfer to other cognitive domains, but
of improvements on the trained task and its close variants (Fellman et al., 2020; Holmes et al.,
2019; Laine et al., 2018; Soveri et al., 2017). These limited transfer effects and their underpinnings
are at focus in the present study.
Even though moderate to large improvements on near transfer tasks have been seen at
group level, individual differences on WM training outcomes are considerable (Karbach &
Verhaeghen, 2014; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Soveri et al., 2017). Despite this, there is a
surprisingly big gap in the literature regarding factors related to these individual differences. Most
studies have focused on group-level changes and only a few WM studies have, to a varying degree,
considered the large inter-individual differences seen in near transfer gains (Anguera et al., 2012;
Borella et al., 2017; Bürki et al., 2014; Foster et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2014; Salminen et al., 2015;
Studer-Luethi et al., 2012; Zinke et al., 2014). Although methodological flaws in the research setups
1

Far transfer refers to improvements seen in another cognitive domain, other than the trained task, e.g., WM training
would increase performance in tasks measuring intelligence (Soveri et al., 2017).
2
Near transfer includes improved performance in tasks intended to measure the same cognitive domain as the
trained task, e.g., by being structurally different or having the same task paradigm as the trained task but differing in
stimuli (Fellman e al., 2020).

2

and/or publication bias may in part account for the discrepancies regarding the effectiveness of WM
training (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016), individual characteristics might help explain another part of
the variance between study results (Guye et al., 2017). It is important to understand the limitations
of these training programs in order to provide realistic and useful suggestions of their use (Redick,
2019).
In the present study, the aim was to analyze the predictive value of an extensive set of
predictor variables (age, gender, education, WM baseline performance level, strategy use,
motivation, alertness, and cognition-related beliefs) for near transfer gains in WM training.
Understanding the potential effects of individual differences on training outcomes could help to
better understand the large inter-individual variability in WM training.

1.1 Transfer gains in WM training
The concept of transfer in learning is not new, as research on the matter dates back a
century. Transfer refers to a learned skill being applied and adapted to novel situations, and it is
essential in all education and training programs. However, a century of studies has shown that
significant far transfer effects are hard to find when measuring any type of cognitive or educational
capacities. The strongest transfer effects have been found on near transfer tasks, where the
participants’ familiarity with relevant task context as well as their underlying cognitive capacity
predict success (Barnett & Ceci, 2002). Yet, the initial research regarding WM training was mainly
done in the spirit of the Capacity Theory, which presumes that intensive, adaptive training at
individual performance limits can expand WM capacity (Engle & Kane, 2004). The assumption was
that such repeated training elicits long-term plasticity in WM-related brain regions, which
consequently can produce significant improvement on the numerous cognitive functions that rely on
WM-related brain regions (Constantinidis & Klingberg, 2016). However, as noted above, it seems
to be the case that WM training can only produce small to large effect-sizes on near transfer
measures (Melby-Lervåg, 2016; Soveri et al., 2017). This is in accordance with Barnett and Ceci’s
(2002) conclusion from a century of studies on the matter of transfer.
An alternative framework to account for WM training improvements has been
provided by the Strategy Mediation hypothesis (Fellman et al., 2020; Laine et al., 2018; Peng &
Fuchs, 2015; Soveri et al., 2017), that considers WM to be a rather limited and fixed cognitive
capacity. According to this hypothesis, training can improve WM performance (but not capacity) by
eliciting a more efficient spontaneous use of strategies during repeated exposure to the trained tasks.

3

The level of performance on WM tasks is seen as a result of how the limited WM capacity is being
used. Efficient use of strategies can therefore enhance performance by freeing up cognitive
capacity, which can be used to boost performance even further (e.g., Peng & Fuchs, 2015). Some
researchers have recently argued that the Strategy Mediation hypothesis is a more suitable
explanation for the limited results from WM training (Gathercole et al., 2019, Fellman et al., 2020;
Laine et al., 2018; Soveri et al., 2017). They argue that strategy use is one important reason why
participants improve on the trained tasks and their untrained variants, but not so much on other WM
task paradigms or far transfer tasks. The reason would be that strategies adopted for the trained task
or tasks can be used on structurally similar task paradigms but not necessarily on structurally
dissimilar tasks.
Based on recent studies, the concept of near transfer in WM training appears to be too
broad and should additionally be divided into task-general and task-specific near transfer (e.g.,
Fellman et al., 2020; Laine et al., 2018; Soveri et al., 2017). Task-specific near transfer entails
transfer to WM tasks sharing the same task paradigm with the trained task(s), while task-general
near transfer pertains to WM tasks that are structurally dissimilar to the trained task (Fellman et al.,
2020). Soveri et al. (2017) criticized previous meta-analyses for not making this distinction and
hence, overestimating the transfer effects within the WM domain. In their own meta-analysis, the
only more substantial near transfer gain they found was task-specific near transfer. They noted that
individuals who trained with n-back tasks (a standard measure of WM, which requires participants
to maintain and update series of stimuli in order to decide whether each new item matches the one
presented n items ago), showed a relatively strong transfer effect (g = 0,62) for untrained versions
of the n-back, and only a small effect (g = 0,24) for other WM transfer tasks. These results allowed
Soveri et al. (2017) to conclude that more emphasis should be put on task-specific aspects of
transfer when trying to understand the mechanisms of WM training. The next section will consider
previous findings regarding predictors of near transfer, while separating between task-specific and
task-general near transfer whenever possible.

1.2 The role of individual characteristics
Due to the inconsistent findings and great inter-individual variability regarding
transfer gains from WM training, several researchers are beginning to turn their focus on the role of
individual characteristics on training outcomes (e.g., Borella et al., 2017; Zinke et al., 2014). The
literature regarding the topic is still very limited, even though researchers like Jaeggi et al. (2012)
pointed out the importance of investigating potential predictors of WM training programs relatively

4

early on. Some researchers have touched the subject of individual predictors of near transfer a few
years earlier, though only with narrow sets of characteristics (e.g., Bürki et al., 2014; Zinke et al.,
2014). Guye et al. (2017) were amongst the first to analyze the impact of a broad range of
individual difference variables on WM training outcomes, albeit they focused only on training task
gains and not on transfer effects. Some researchers have, however, found positive correlations
between training and transfer gains (Chein & Morrison 2010; Zinke et al., 2014). If the Strategy
Mediation hypothesis is correct (as suggested by e.g. Laine et al., 2018), a rapidly increasing
individual learning curve on the trained task(s) could indicate that a new strategy is being learned
and applied (Chein & Schneider, 2012). Consequently, this could predict the emergence of taskspecific near transfer as well (Chein & Morrison 2010; Zinke et al., 2014). Note however that not
everyone agrees with this conclusion. Researchers like Redick (2019), as well as Tidwell et al.
(2014) highlight the need to regard the correlation between training and transfer gains with caution,
as not all studies have been able to replicate the existence of such links (Au et al., 2014).
In the next section, previous studies addressing the individual predictors targeted in
the current study (age, gender, education, strategy use, WM baseline performance level, motivation,
alertness and cognition-related beliefs) are briefly reviewed. Studies focusing on predictors of
specifically near transfer are summarized in Table 1.

1.3 Individual predictors
WM baseline performance level at pre-test seems to moderate near transfer gains, as
seen in the studies summarized in Table 1. However, inconsistent results have been obtained
regarding the direction of this. Some researchers have observed a magnification effect (Foster et al.,
2017), some have provided evidence for a compensation effect (Hunt et al., 2014) and others have
observed both (Borella et al., 2017). A magnification effect indicates that individuals with a higher
WM baseline performance level at the beginning of training show greater improvements, assumedly
because they have more cognitive resources and can therefore learn new cognitive routines more
easily. A compensation effect, on the other hand, indicates that low-performing individuals benefit
more from training, possibly because they have more room for improvement than high-performing
individuals, who are already at the top of their performance (e.g., Borella et al., 2017). The only
meta-analysis on this matter by Melby-Lervåg et al. (2016), found that individuals with a condition

Level of analysis refers to whether the individual differences were analyzed by 1. splitting the individuals by a dichotomous variable, often by a median-split
design of high and low, and comparing the two subgroups using e.g., ANOVA (group-level analysis) or 2. employing the predictors as continuous individual
difference variables in a regression analysis (Individual level analysis).
Plus (+) or minus (-) refers to the moderating effect of the significant predictor. Plus indicates that the individuals higher in that predictor (e.g., higher age)
improved more and minus that individuals lower in that predictor (e.g., lower WM baseline level) improved more.

6

associated with impaired WM showed less near transfer than healthy adults. However, no
significant difference was found in near transfer gains between high- vs. low-performing healthy
individuals.
Age as a predictor has received inconsistent support, as demonstrated in Table 1.
Additionally, only one meta-analysis (Melby-Lervåg, 2016) found age to predict near transfer so
that children improved less than younger and older adults. Among adults, no differences were found
based on age, a result supported by two other meta-analyses that included age as a moderator
(Karbach & Verhaeghen, 2014; Soveri et al., 2017).
The connection between WM baseline performance level and age is a factor that
makes it harder to determine how these two variables predict near transfer gains. This is because
some normal (non-pathological) cognitive decline occurs in adult aging. The domains most affected
are processing speed, reasoning, memory and executive functions (Deary et al., 2009). Gajewski et
al. (2018) found that these cognitive functions are important for the overall functionality of WM,
and accordingly, that also WM performance decreases with age. This has led to the standpoint that
these two predictors are interlinked (e.g., Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). Foster et al. (2017) noted that
individuals with a low WM capacity were also generally older than those having a higher WM
capacity. Borella et al. (2017) found support for this association, as significant gains on tasks
tapping task-general near transfer were moderated by both age and WM baseline level. On more
“active” WM tasks (resembling the n-back task that is of particular interest in the present study),
participants with a higher initial performance and younger age gained more from the training
regime, in line with the magnification effect. On more “passive” WM tasks like the Forward Digit
Span task (recalling series of digits in the same order they were presented), however, participants
with a lower WM baseline and an older age benefited more from training, thus indicating a
compensation effect. Taken together, the predictors varied in their moderating effect on task-general
near transfer depending on the task at hand. Zinke et al. (2014) also found that the older the
individuals were, the less task-general near transfer gains and training task gains they showed in
their sample of 80 older adults (65 - 95 years of age). However, Zinke et al. (2014) found a lower
WM baseline performance level to result in larger training task gains, regardless of age.
Personality features and their relationships with WM training and transfer outcomes
have also been explored in a few studies. Studer-Luethi et al. (2012) found that neuroticism and
conscientiousness (as measured by the Mini-Marker Set [Saucier, 1994], which is based on the
Five-Factor Model) predicted task-specific near transfer in their sample of 85 undergraduates.
Individuals high in conscientiousness or low in neuroticism showed higher task-specific near

7

transfer. Those high in neuroticism also reported less training enjoyment, suggesting that high
neuroticism (e.g., worrying) reduces the cognitive capacity available and leads to less near transfer
(Studer-Luethi et al., 2012). Urbánek and Marček (2015), on the other hand, did not find any
significant effects of personality traits (as measured by The Personality Styles and Disorders
Inventory [Kuhl & Kazén, 1997]) on far transfer when analyzing data compiled from three different
cognitive training groups (two versions of the n-back task and one mental rotation task). This was
supported by Guye et al. (2017), who also failed to find any significant associations between
training task gains and personality traits of the Big Five.
Motivation is another variable that has been speculated to moderate training
outcomes (Jaeggi et al., 2013), though several studies have shown that this might not be the case
(Anguera et al. 2012; Guye et al., 2017; Jaeggi et al., 2013). Anguera et al. (2012) found their
participants showing equally large task-specific near transfer during post-test, despite some
participants losing some of their self-assessed motivation and engagement along the way. Guye et
al. (2017) suggested that motivation accounted for daily fluctuations in training performance, but
not for the overall training task gains. Jaeggi et al. (2013) found evidence that motivational factors
predict whether individuals completed the training program, rather than altering the learning curve
or the degree of transfer. They also found that intrinsic motivation seems to be more beneficial for
WM training programs, whereas extrinsic rewards, such as monetary compensation, can reduce
intrinsic motivation (Deci et al., 1999) and consequently, reduce training and transfer gains.
According to Jaeggi et al. (2013), most researchers extrinsically compensate participants for
participating in WM training programs, which might result in participants lacking the motivation to
commit to training. This, they argue, could account for some studies lacking significant transfer
effects.
Cognition-related beliefs (e.g., whether an individual consider it possible to improve
intelligence) have been argued to affect WM training results, though no study so far has focused
specifically on their effect on near transfer. Guye et al. (2017) found that subjects with beliefs in the
malleability of intelligence showed less improvement in the trained task following WM training.
Jaeggi et al. (2013), on the other hand, noted that individuals who believed intelligence to be
malleable, showed greater far transfer gains than those who believed intelligence to be fixed. Jaeggi
et al. (2013) speculated that this improvement could be modulated by a placebo effect. In a small
study with 25 participants by Foroughi et al. (2016), a similar relationship was found. The
experiment group was intentionally induced with a placebo-effect through a suggestive
advertisement. They were then compared to a control group, recruited by a nonsuggestive

8

advertisement. Only the placebo group showed significant improvement on fluid intelligence tasks
after one hour of training with a dual n-back task, supporting the notion of a strong placebo effect in
WM training. The results highlighted the importance of active controls. Soveri et al. (2017), on the
other hand, found no differences in the degree of transfer in studies using an active vs. passive
control group, making it hard to interpret why cognition-related beliefs would significantly predict
transfer gains following WM training.
Strategy use is another, more recently highlighted predictor that can moderate the
effect of near transfer. As previously mentioned, the Strategy Mediation hypothesis postulates that
the more advanced the used strategies are, the better the outcome of WM training regimes both on
the trained task and on tasks tapping task-specific transfer (Fellman et al., 2020; Gathercole et al.,
2019; Laine et al., 2018). No previous study has yet examined whether strategy use already prior to
intervention predicts subsequent near transfer gains. The aim of the studies by Fellman et al. (2020)
and Laine et al. (2018) was instead to explicitly analyze how strategies are being developed during
training and how they then moderate WM training outcomes. According to Gajewski et al. (2018),
younger adults rely more heavily on general executive functions when performing the n-back task,
while older adults tend to rely more on attention, verbal memory and updating in order to
compensate for age-related cognitive decline. Younger individuals might have a more suitable
cognitive capacity to adopt sophisticated strategies and have more resources to spare after the task
becomes automated (Chein, & Schneider, 2012). This could explain why young adults seem to
improve faster on a trained task than older ones, as they have been found to adopt effective
strategies more quickly (Bürki et al., 2014). Older adults might simply take longer to adopt these
strategies, as they can rely less on general executive functions (Gajewski et al., 2018).
Some other variables have also been hypothesized to predict transfer and/or training
task gains, but the evidence is lacking. For instance, gender has not been found to moderate any
training task gains (Guye et al., 2017; Matysiak et al., 2019) or near transfer (Hunt et al., 2014).
Variables such as leisure activities, computer literacy and previous cognitive training have not
been found to predict training task gains (Guye et al., 2017), and the need for cognition (the
amount of enjoyment from difficult cognitive tasks) was not connected to the level of far transfer
shown (Jaeggi et al., 2014).
In summary, the limited literature indicates that the most consistent predictor of
transfer effects is WM baseline performance level. For the other individual characteristics, except
age, there is only limited support for them being reliable predictors of near transfer, with evidence
usually stemming just from a single study. One should also note that there are large discrepancies in

9

both the methodology and the results between these studies. In some studies, researchers have
focused only on a single predictor like age (e.g., Salminen et al., 2015) or WM baseline (Foster et
al., 2017), ignoring the fact that these predictors can overlap (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). In other
studies, the samples have been quite small (e.g., Anguera et al., 2012; Hunt et al., 2014), making it
hard to determine whether the results are reliable or not (Karbach & Verhaeghen, 2014). In some
cases, task-specific and task-general near transfer effects are intertwined, blurring the findings
(Soveri et al., 2017). A distinction should also be made between studies basing their conclusions on
group-level comparisons or on regression models where the predictors are employed as continuous
variables. The first ones are often conducted as post hoc comparisons where a continuous variable is
split into a dichotomous variable, often by a median-split. This leads to a loss of power and
information, as well as a reduction of effect sizes, partly because of regression towards the mean
(Moreau et al., 2016). Analyzing predictive variables at an individual level in regression models
allows for more sensitive data analysis, with less statistical distortion in the results (Guye et al.,
2017). More research, especially focusing on multiple predictors on an individual level, is needed
before any firm conclusions can be drawn on predictors of near transfer.

2. Research questions
Based on previous literature, the aim of the present study was to examine whether
individual differences predict transfer gains on untrained tasks that are structurally similar to the
trained task (task-specific near transfer) following WM training. The individual characteristics
analyzed were age, education, gender, WM baseline performance level, strategy use, motivation,
alertness and cognition-related beliefs. Due to scarcity of relevant previous studies and their
discrepant results, the present study was exploratory, and no hypotheses were put forth prior to
analysis. The overall purpose was to add to the large knowledge gap regarding individual predictors
of near transfer in WM training, shedding light on the heavily debated question as to why near
transfer gains vary so much between individuals. This study followed the guidelines by Soveri et al.
(2017), who highlighted the importance of separating training task gains and transfer gains, as well
as task-general and task-specific near transfer gains. Here the focus was narrowed down to taskspecific near transfer, as this type of transfer has recently been shown to be the only more
substantial form of transfer from WM training (Soveri et al., 2017).

3. Method
3.1 Procedure
The data used in the present study stemmed from a pre-registered fully onlineadministered randomized controlled trial by Fellman et al. (2020) who tested the Strategy Mediation
hypothesis in WM training in detail. The original study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Åbo Akademi University in accordance
with the Helsinki Declaration. Prior to the data collection, the study protocol was pre-registered at
AsPredicted.org (https://aspredicted.org/r7qs9.pdf). All testing and training sessions were
performed on an in-house developed customizable Java-based experiment platform called SOILE.
This platform enables creation, distribution and management of psychological experiments and
cognitive interventions via the Internet. In the Fellman et al. (2020) study, a total of 419
participants, varying in age from 18-50 years, were recruited through the crowdworking site Prolific
Academic (https://www.prolific.co/). The participants remained anonymous during the whole study,
as they were only identified using a Prolific ID (a string of random characters assigned to them by
Prolific). Before starting the study on the SOILE platform, they had to agree to an informed
consent. They were informed about the study setup, as well as about how the forthcoming monetary
compensation would be provided. They were also informed about their right to withdraw from the
study if/whenever they wanted. As the Prolific Academic participant pool was not screened for all
the exclusion criteria, potential participants completed a few minutes’ pre-screening survey using
the SOILE platform. The inclusion criteria were as follows: English native speaker, no serious
psychiatric or neurological illnesses, no current use of CNS medication and no current psychotropic
drug use. Out of 419 participants initially invited, 9 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion
criteria, 78 were excluded for not completing the pre-test, 30 withdrew after completing only the
pre-test, 25 withdrew during training, 13 were excluded for using external memory aids during
training and 6 for being multivariate outliers. All in all, 161 participants were excluded for either
not meeting the inclusion criteria or not completing the study, leaving a total of 258 participants.
The participants completed a pre-test in week 1, including background questionnaires
and a test battery consisting of 10 WM tasks. The pre-test took approximately 2 hours
(reimbursement £10). After this, the participants were randomly divided into three groups: a
strategy training group (n = 73), a traditional training group (n = 118) and a passive control group (n
= 67). Prior to randomization, the participants were told that they would be assigned to either a
training or a control group. The ratio of group selection was 2:1:1 to provide a 50 % chance of

11

being allocated in the traditional training group, and 25 % chance to join the other two groups,
respectively. The participants in the traditional training group had a typical WM training regime
where they practiced with an adaptive n-back task without any strategy guidance. The strategy
training group trained with the same task but was provided with external strategy instructions aimed
to boost the use of an effective visualization strategy. The passive control group did not receive any
training and participated only in the pre-test, the intermediate test and the post-test. In addition to
being compensated 10£ for the pre-test, the monetary compensation for the rest of the study was
50£ for the participants in the training group and 20£ for the ones in the control group.
Figure 1
The study setup in Fellman et al.’s (2020) study

Out of the three groups, the intervention in the traditional training group (training
without given strategy) was similar to a considerable portion of previous WM training studies
(Soveri et al., 2017) and hence, chosen as the target group in the present study. This allowed for a
better comparison with previous studies on predictor variables. An important prerequisite for the
present study was that the group-level analyses in Fellman et al. (2020) revealed statistically
significant task-specific near transfer effects on all three untrained variants of the n-back task in
both training groups. This allowed for further investigation of potential individual predictors for
transfer. Prior to the current analysis, an additional five participants in the traditional training group
were removed due to missing values caused by technical errors during data gathering. The missing
values appeared random and no imputation was conducted.

12

3.2 The traditional training group
After the pre-test, the participants in the traditional training group underwent a fourweek training program, including twelve 30-minute WM training sessions. The intermediate test
was conducted during week 3 following three initial training sessions, and the post-test during week
6 when the participants had completed the whole training program. As compared to the pre-test,
both the intermediate and the post-test took approximately 2 hours to complete and included the
same cognitive tasks. The timetable of the 4-week long WM training program and the assessment
tests is presented in Figure 2.
Figure 2

3.2.1 Training task
The sole training task in all of the 12 training sessions was an adaptive n-back task
with digits as stimuli. In this task, a sequence of digits ranging from 1 to 9 was presented, one digit
at a time. The participants were instructed to respond via computer keyboard (one button for yes
and one for no) whether or not the current digit was the same as the one presented n items back.
Each training session consisted of 20 blocks, with each block containing 20 + n trials. Out of the 20
trials in a block, six were targets and 14 non-targets. Four of the non-targets were so-called lures,
that is, they were identical to the target items but in adjacent n ± 1 positions. The lures were

13

included to discourage decisions based on mere familiarity of the items. Each sequence in a block
was structured in the same way. First a blank screen was presented for 450 ms, then a stimulus for
1500 ms, followed by another blank screen for 450 ms, and then the next stimulus appeared. This
pattern continued until the end of the block. The level of the n-back was automatically determined
by the participants’ success rate, rendering the task easier or more difficult (i.e., adaptive)
depending on how the participant performed. The level of the n-back varied between 1 and 15,
starting with a 1-back task in the first training session. If the participants answered correctly on 1820 trials in a block, they advanced one level. If one succeeded with 15-17 trials, the n-back level
stayed the same and anything less than correct 15 trials resulted in a decrease of n by one. The
starting level of each new training session followed the n – 2 principle, i.e., two levels below the
highest n-back level reached in the previous training session.

3.2.2 Task-specific near transfer tasks
Three WM tasks sharing the same task paradigm as the trained task were used as
measures of task-specific near transfer. They were administered at pre-test, intermediate test and
post-test. These were thus untrained variants of the n-back task, having the same task structure but
different stimuli. They included n-back with letters (NBL), n-back with colors (NBC) and n-back
with boxes (NBB). They all had the same number of blocks, targets and non-targets (including
lures), as well as the same stimulus exposure/response time. The NBL used the nine first letters of
the English alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) and the NBC used nine colors (purple, black, pink,
yellow, red, green, blue, grey, orange). The NBB used a 3 x 3 matrix where a target (cell marked
with a contrast color) moved from one spatial location to another. The participants completed 12
blocks of each task and the average level of n-back reached was used as the dependent variable.

3.2.3 Predictor variables
In the study by Fellman et al. (2020), information on several individual differences
variables was gathered at pre-test. Demographic variables (age, years of education, gender) were
registered with background questionnaires. Means and standard deviations for the demographic
variables, as well as gender distribution, are presented in Table 2.

WM baseline performance level (see Table 3) was a composite score of the three
task-specific near transfer n-back tasks (n-back with letters, colors and blocks) in the pre-test
battery. All three task scores were standardized before they were modulated further. The average
standardized level of n-back reached in each of the three tasks were added together and divided by
three, to create a mean of the average level of n-back reached for each participant. This mean was
used as a composite score for WM baseline performance level in the analysis.
Strategy use was measured separately for each WM task at pre-test, starting with a
yes/no question as to whether the participant used any kind of strategy. If the participant confirmed
to be using one, the next question prompted to describe the self-generated strategy in their own
words in the comment field, and to rate how consistently the described strategy was employed on a
10-point Likert scale (1 = Highly inconsistently, 10 = Highly consistently). The written strategy
reports were coded for two variables, Strategy Type and Level of Detail. The former indicated what
type of strategy the individual used (e.g., rehearsal, grouping of stimuli etc.) and the latter reflected
the level of sophistication of the strategy by determining the number of details given in the strategy
report. The latter variable, introduced by Laine et al. (2018), served as the measure of strategy use
in this study, ranging from 0 to 4 depending on how advanced the strategy was. This allowed
individuals to be compared to each other by rank and the rank numbers were suitable for multiple
regression analysis. Zero points denote the absence of any strategy in the strategy report. Highly
vague strategies were given one point (e.g., “I tried to keep up but found it quite difficult”). Rather
non-specific strategies were given two points (e.g., “Just tried to concentrate on the numbers”). A
general strategy description with at most one detail was given three points (e.g., “I tried to repeat
the previous digits each time a new one appeared”). Four points were given to descriptions with two
or more details (e.g., “Memorized the four letters as one sequence and replaced each letter as a new
one came up”). Fellman et al. (2020) used two evaluators to code the strategy reports independently
and any discrepancies were solved through consensus. The agreement between the two independent
evaluators was examined using a linearly weighted kappa analysis (κw) that revealed good-to-

15

perfect agreement for the Level of Detail classifications for the WM tasks at pre-test (κw range 0.86
– 0.96). In the present study, the predictor variable strategy use (see Table 3) was created by adding
the strategy points from the three task-specific near transfer tasks and dividing the sum by three,
thus creating a mean score for strategy use.
Motivation and alertness (see Table 3) were respectively assessed after the last WM
task of the pre-test using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Motivation was measured by asking the
participants to rate their level of motivation towards completing the tasks with the help of a 5-point
Likert scale (1 = Not at all motivated, 5 = Very motivated). Alertness was measured using a similar
Likert scale, as the participants rated their energy level (1 = Very tired, 5 = Very alert).
Cognition-related beliefs (see Table 3) were assessed using the Working Memory
Questionnaire (WMQ), developed by Vallat-Azouvi et al., (2012). The original scale was developed
for clinical use to assess the subjective consequences of WM deficits in everyday life. The WMQ is
a self-administered scale probing short-term storage, attention and executive control in daily life. It
consists of 30 questions (e.g., “Do you feel that fatigue excessively reduces your attention?”,
“When you are carrying out an activity, if you realize you are making a mistake, do you find it
difficult to change strategy?”), each rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all, 4 = Extremely)
(Vallat-Azouvi et al., 2012). In their sample of 313 healthy participants, Vallat-Azouvi et al. (2012)
reported good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha; .89) and good internal validity. Fellman et al. (2020)
adopted the WMQ as an indicator of how individuals perceive the functionality of their own WM.
In this study, the total sum score (maximum: 120 points) of the questions was used as the predictor
variable. Lower points indicated that the individual perceived himself/herself as having a highly
functioning WM, while higher points indicated the opposite.

3.2.4 Dependent variable
The dependent variable was the total amount of task-specific near transfer seen in the
three untrained versions of the n-back task (n-back with letters, colors and blocks). Although all
task-specific near transfer tasks encompassed the same task paradigm, score range and setup, they
were standardized to z-scores. This was done to avoid the potential risk of some n-back task with a
higher transfer effect to exert a disproportionally strong influence on the total task-specific near
transfer score. The transfer score was attained as follows; the average standardized level of n-back
reached at post-test was subtracted with the average standardized level of n-back reached at pre-test,
respectively for each task. This yielded a separate task-specific near transfer score for each of the
three tasks. These three scores were added together for each participant after which the total sum
was divided by three. Thus, a standardized mean variable was created for the average level of nback reached in all three untrained n-back tasks (M = 0.00, SD = 0.71, Min = -1.76, Max = 1.79). A
positive score indicated that the participant’s average performance had improved following WM
training, meaning task-specific near transfer gains had occurred. A negative score indicated that the
participant’s performance level in the task-specific near transfer tasks had worsened following WM
training. Zero points indicated no change.

3.3 Analytical approach
The statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. A preliminary
analysis investigated Pearson’s correlations between all the independent variables, as well as the
dependent variable. Multiple regression analyses were then conducted to explore the predictive
values of the individual difference variables for task-specific near transfer gains. Alpha level was
set to p < .05 in all analyses. Due to the large number of independent predictors in relation to the
sample size, the multiple regression analyses were separated into three sets to avoid model
overfitting. The five statistical assumptions for a multiple regression analysis (Williams et al., 2013)
were investigated in all three models. By testing for these assumptions, the risk for type 1 errors
(falsely accepting the findings as significant when they in fact occurred by chance) and type 2 errors
(falsely reporting no significant effect when there actually is one) were reduced (Osborne & Waters,
2002). First, the models were tested for the normality of residuals in order to meet the statistical
assumption of normally distributed residuals. This was done by graphically applying a histogram
and a probability-probability plot (P-P plot) with the observed standardized residuals. The
histogram and P-P plot were used to observe whether the standardized residuals were closely related
to the expected standardized residuals or if any deviations existed in the data. If the residuals were

17

normally distributed, they would appear evenly distributed on both sides of the standardized zero
value in the histogram and conform to the diagonal normality line in the P-P plot. Second, a scatter
plot, with the standardized residuals on the x-axis and standardized predicted values on the y-axis,
was applied to check for the statistical assumption of a homoscedastic distribution of the residuals.
This was done to make sure that the variance (residuals) around the regression line was the same for
all levels of the predictor variable. If the assumption of a homoscedastic distribution was not met,
the residuals in the scatter plot would bunch together at some values and be further apart at other
values. Third, the statistical assumption of linearity refers to a straight-line relationship between the
predictor variables and the dependent variable and this assumption was automatically met if the two
above-mentioned assumptions (normally distributed and homoscedastic residuals) were met.
Fourth, the statistical assumption of independent errors was tested for by applying the DurbinWatson test (values ranging from 0 to 4). This was conducted in order to make sure that the
residuals did not correlate with each other. Values close to 2 indicated that the assumption of
independent errors was met, as there was no problem with correlating residuals. Fifth, all predictors
within each model were tested for the statistical assumption of no multicollinearity by running
collinearity diagnostics (Tolerance levels & VIF-values). This was done to guard against highly
correlated predictors, as that would cause problems in determining which predictors in the model
are important, even though it would not reduce the predictive power of the whole model per se.
Tolerance levels above 0,1 (preferably over 0,2) and VIF-values below 10 indicated that the
assumption of no multicollinearity was met.
Due to the exploratory nature of the study, all variables included in a set were added
to the regression analysis simultaneously. This was justified, as these variables either lack or have
inconsistent evidence of their influence on near transfer gains. In other words, analyzing the
potential effect of each predictor in the model was more important than finding the best possible
model. The use of three separate analyses followed a rule of thumb for multiple regression analyses,
that recommends at least 20 participants per variable (Field, 2018). In the present study a sample
size of 160 participants would have been required, if all eight variables had been included in the
same model. Thus, with 113 participants, an exclusion of three of the eight predictors would have
been needed to meet this demand. As there are no robust previous study results regarding predictors
of near transfer, an exclusion would have been almost completely on random and hence, not
warranted. Instead, by chunking the predictors that were naturally related, the statistical
assumptions for multiple regression were met and a wider set of predictors could be analyzed. The
three predictor sets are presented in Table 4.

4. Results
4.1 Descriptive data
The final sample consisted of 113 individuals. The sample data met parametric test
demands, allowing for further analysis. The Pearson’s correlation analysis (see Table 5) with the
predictor variables (age, education, pre-test WM performance level, strategy use, motivation,
alertness and WMQ) and the dependent variable (task-specific near transfer gains) revealed a few
significant correlations. Gender was not included due to its dichotomous nature.
The demographic variables age and education, included in the first multiple regression
analysis, did not show a statistically significant correlation with transfer gains and they did not
correlate with each other. The two cognitive measures (pre-test WM performance level and strategy
use), included in the second multiple regression analysis, showed a moderate positive
intercorrelation. Put differently, the higher the WM performance level, the more sophisticated
strategies were used. However, only pre-test WM performance level showed a significant bivariate
correlation with transfer gains. This correlation was moderate and negative, meaning that a lower
pre-test WM performance level was connected to more transfer gains. None of the subjective
measures (motivation, alertness and WMQ) included in the third multiple regression analysis did
show statistically significant correlations with transfer gains. They did, however, show moderate to
strong intercorrelations between each other. A positive strong correlation was found between
motivation and alertness. If the participants were motivated, they were also likely alert and vice
versa. WMQ showed a moderate negative correlation with alertness and motivation. In other words,
the more alert and motivated the participants were, the less WM-related problems they reported
having. Additionally, weak but significant positive correlations were found between strategy use

19

and education, as well as between motivation and age. A weak but significant negative correlation
was found between WMQ and age, meaning that higher age resulted in less self-perceived everyday
problems with WM.

4.2 Predictors of task-specific near transfer gains
The predictive value of the three sets of variables (demographic: age, education,
gender; cognitive: pre-test WM performance level and pre-test strategy use; subjective: motivation,
alertness, WMQ) was examined using three separate multiple regression analyses. In the first
analysis with the demographic variables (see Table 6), all statistical assumptions were met,
allowing for further analysis. The model did not, however, reach statistical significance (R2 = .02,
F[3, 109] = .81, p = .49), indicating that the combined effect of age, education and gender was not
related to the task-specific near transfer gains.

The second multiple regression model, with pre-test WM performance level and
strategy use included, met all statistical assumptions, allowing for further analysis. The results from
the analysis (see Table 7) showed a statistically significant regression equation (R2 = .15, F[2, 110]
= 9.66, p = .00). In other words, the model explained 15 % of the variance in task-specific near
transfer gain scores. The possibility to generalize the results from the regression model to the
population was decent, as the adjusted R square (adjusted R2 = .13) was close to the determination
coefficient. Out of the two variables, only pre-test WM performance level reached significance. The
relationship between pre-test WM performance level and task-specific near transfer gains was
negative, such that lower pre-test WM performance level resulted in more transfer gains. This
connection is graphically presented as a partial regression plot in Figure 3, demonstrating the
negative linear relationship between pre-test WM performance level and transfer gains.

In the third multiple regression analysis, the subjective measures motivation, alertness
and WMQ were tested as predictors of task-specific near transfer gains. The regression model met
all statistical assumptions allowing for further analysis. However, the model did not reach statistical
significance (R2 = .04, F[3, 109] = 1.57, p = .20) (see Table 8), indicating that the combined effect
of the participants’ motivation- and alertness levels, as well as their perceived WM functionality,
was not related to task-specific near transfer gains.

5. Discussion
5.1 Main findings
The aim of the study was to examine if certain individual characteristics contribute to
explaining previous inconsistent results regarding near transfer effects in WM training programs.
Despite the importance of considering individual characteristics that might help in explaining the
large inter-individual differences found in WM training outcome, only a few studies have
considered this issue. Most WM training studies have focused on training improvements at the
group level, ignoring the large differences in training outcomes at the individual level (Guye et al.,
2017). In this study, eight variables (age, education, gender, WM baseline performance level,
strategy use, motivation, alertness and cognition-related beliefs) were considered as predictors of
task-specific near transfer gains. This type of transfer concerned improvements on untrained WM
tasks (n-back with letters, colors and blocks) that were structurally similar to the trained task (nback with digits). To the author´s knowledge, no previous study has examined task-specific near
transfer effects in relation to an equally broad array of potentially relevant predictors.
Using multiple regression, the eight variables included in this study were organized
into three distinct sets of predictors that were fed into separate models: demographic variables (age,
education, gender), cognitive measures (WM baseline performance level, strategy use) and
subjective measures (motivation, alertness, cognition-related beliefs). Out of the three regression
models, only the second model, with the cognitive measures WM baseline performance level and
strategy use as predictors, reached significance (discussed in the next paragraph). Neither the model
with demographic variables nor the model with subjective measures reached significance. Put
differently, none of these six predictors (age, gender, education, motivation, alertness and
cognition-related beliefs) was found to predict task-specific near transfer. It is possible that the
predictors in the set with subjective measures might have overlapped, as they were found to have
moderate to strong intercorrelations. Especially motivation and alertness were strongly related and
thus, including them both in the same set might have removed some of their unique variance. Out of
the three demographic variables and the three subjective measures, only motivation, gender and age
have previously been studied in relation to task-specific near transfer. The absence of motivation as
a predictor was in line with the results by Anguera et al. (2012), and the absence of a predicting
effect of gender was in accordance with the results by Hunt et al. (2014). The absence of age as a
predictor of task-specific near transfer was also in accordance with most previous studies (Karbach
& Verhaeghen, 2014; Soveri et al., 2017). Some studies have shown that younger age is related to

23

higher transfer gains, but these have been conducted in relation to task-general near transfer and
with wider age gaps between participants, as they included individuals up to 80+ years (Borella et
al., 2017; Dahlin et al., 2008; Zinke et al., 2014). In this study, the age of the participants only
ranged from 18-50. Normal age-related cognitive decline (Deary et al., 2009) would have been
more evident if the sample had included older adults (60+ years), who are more likely to have
experienced more significant cognitive decline in relation to younger adults. In other words, with a
larger age gap between participants, age might have predicted near transfer gains, as was seen in the
study by Dahlin et al. (2008).

5.2 Cognitive measures as predictors of task-specific near transfer
In the statistically significant regression model with the cognitive measures included,
only WM baseline performance level was found to significantly predict task-specific near transfer
gains, while strategy use showed a trend of statistical significance (p = .10). This matches the fact
that the former showed a significant bivariate correlation with transfer gains, while the latter did
not. The connection between WM baseline performance level and transfer gains in the multiple
regression model was negative so that lower WM baseline performance resulted in more taskspecific near transfer gains achieved. These results support the existence of a compensation effect,
indicating that low-performing individuals benefit more from training, possibly because they have
more room for improvement than high-performing individuals, who are already at the top of their
performance (Borella et al., 2017). This is in line with some studies on near transfer, where such a
compensation has been found in relation to both task-general (Borella et al., 2017) and task-specific
near transfer (Hunt et al., 2014). These studies were, however, conducted with selective subgroups
consisting of either older adults or children. When a young adult age group was investigated, Foster
et al. (2017) found an opposite magnification effect of WM baseline performance level positively
predicting task-general near transfer. Thus, cognitively high-performing individuals improved more
than low-performing individuals. The results by Foster et al. (2017) are possibly affected by the fact
that they used group level analyses of high vs. low WM baseline performance level and not a more
sensitive regression analysis with individual performance levels. Their results might have been
distorted due to a regression towards the mean (Moreau et al., 2016), if their sample included
several individuals with either really high or really low WM baseline performance levels. However,
a magnification effect has also been more prominent, as compared to a compensation effect, in
studies on training task gains with healthy young adults (Foster et al., 2017; Guye et al., 2017;
Wiemers et al., 2018). One potential explanation for the opposite effect found in all aforementioned

24

studies could be that a magnification effect requires more training sessions to become evident, and a
compensation effect or null results are more likely with less amount of training. In all the abovementioned studies, at least 20 training sessions were applied as compared to the 12-session WM
training program in this study. One meta-analysis did find the amount of training sessions to
moderate near transfer gains so that more training led to more prominent near transfer (Weicker et
al., 2016), albeit such a link has been refuted by two other meta-analyses (Schwaighofer et al.,
2015; Soveri et al., 2017). Nonetheless, it is possible that low-performing individuals might show
larger near transfer improvements during the initial phase of the WM training program, but this
improvement might level out and dissipate further on if these participants are faced with their
cognitive barriers. High-performing individuals on the other hand, might continue improving and
enhancing their performance on near transfer tasks the more training they receive. However, such a
phenomenon does not seem to apply for training task gains, as cognitively high-performing
individuals also have been shown to improve faster than individuals lower in cognitive ability
(Guye et al., 2017; Matysiak et al., 2019). This does not automatically mean that the same applies
for task-specific near transfer, as many researchers warns against relying too strongly on a
connection between training task gains and transfer gains (Redick, 2019; Tidwell et al., 2014). It is
also important to remember that not all studies have been able to detect either a compensation or a
magnification effect (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). This adds to the controversy regarding the
predictive power of WM baseline performance level. Therefore, more investigation is needed in
order to understand whether and how a compensation/magnification effect occurs in relation to
task-specific near transfer in WM training.
The fact that strategy use did not reach significance in the multiple regression model is
surprising, as the Strategy Mediation hypothesis is receiving more and more support (Fellman et al.,
2020; Gathercole et al., 2019; Laine et al., 2018; Soveri et al., 2017). This might partly be due to the
fact that strategy use and WM baseline performance level share some of their explained variance,
leading to their unique contribution disappearing when fed into one and the same model. This is
supported by the significant positive bivariate correlation (r = .41) found between these measures.
However, when only analyzing the predictive value of strategy use post hoc, using a simple linear
regression analysis, the variable was not even near to reaching significance. This would indicate
that WM baseline performance level was the carrying force in making the multiple regression
analysis model with the two cognitive predictors statistically significant. Thus, the statistically
significant positive correlation found between WM baseline performance level and strategy use
would not account for the non-significant beta value of the strategy predictor. To sum up, based on

25

these results, implicit strategies do not appear to play a significant role, suggesting that most
individuals would start from the same clean slate in terms of strategy development at the beginning
of a WM training program. Instead strategy development and strategy use seem to obtain a more
central role following repeated practice with a WM task (i.e., the actual WM training), as strategies
are developed and enhanced (Fellman et al., 2020; Laine et al., 2018). In other words, individuals
do not appear to have pre-existing strategies obtained from real-life situations that would be directly
suitable to adapt to the novel tasks in WM training. Gathercole et al. (2019) support this conclusion,
as they argue for the acquisition of new routines following WM training with unfamiliar tasks such
as the n-back, and they compare the process to learning a new skill.

5.3 Implications
The results in this study provide crucial information regarding individual predictors of
near transfer, and more specifically, task-specific near transfer. Due to the large discrepancies
regarding the effects of WM training and poor generalizability to other cognitive domains (Soveri et
al., 2017), researchers are beginning to lose interest in WM training programs (Redick, 2019).
Before completely abandoning the concept, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate whether WM
programs can be tailored to individually suit participants, who have the largest potential to improve
their cognitive functioning following WM training. This could justify the commercial use of WM
training programs for certain target groups (Redick, 2019). WM baseline performance level was
found to significantly predict task-specific transfer gains and thus, add to a slightly more optimistic
view regarding WM training programs. In theory, the compensation effect found could potentially
mean that WM training programs can be applied for rehabilitation purposes (e.g. for individuals
with an intellectual or a learning disability), as individuals with a weaker WM performance level
appear to benefit more from training. This is a rather optimistic view, however, as the gains are only
task-specific and appear to be a result of strategy use, rather than anything else (Fellman et al.,
2020). Put differently, the problem with generalization to real-life settings still exists, making any
commercial or rehabilitating use of WM training programs questionable (Redick, 2019).
Additionally, with only WM baseline performance reaching significance, another issue emerges in
relation to any commercial implications. This variable is problematic as the mapping of a baseline
level would require the use of a battery of cognitive tests. The question then arises as to whether the
potential benefits of the WM training programs are worth the large-scale mapping of cognitive
abilities in order to choose suitable participants. The predictors in this study that could have easily
been used to determine inclusion criteria (age, education and gender), did not reach significance.

26

Neither does it seem relevant to ask the participants for their subjective opinions regarding WM
programs as none of the subjective measures (motivation, alertness and cognition-related beliefs)
reached significance.

5.4 Limitations
Despite several strengths in the present study, there are some limitations to consider.
First, Fellman et al. (2020) conducted an intermediate test in the middle of the training period, in
addition to a pre- and a post-test. The negative consequence of this for the present study is an
increased risk for a so-called test-retest effect, which leads to an overestimation of the amount of
transfer found. A test-retest effect (also called practice effect) refers to the fact that individuals tend
to improve their performance following repeated exposure to the same task (Lemay et al., 2004).
This problem is already evident with only a pre-test and a post-test but increases even further with
an intermediate test. This is not problematic when analyzing the overall effectivity of a WM
training program at a group-level, as the control group removes the problem with a test-retest effect
(Soveri et al., 2017) However, when focusing on individual predictors using a within-group
multiple regression analysis, the problem exists. This means that a part of the task-specific near
transfer found in the training group had nothing to do with the training regime, but simply with the
fact that the test battery was familiar at the time of the post-test (Tidwell et al., 2014). One way to
tackle this would be to compare the present kind of training group analysis to a similar one
conducted with a control group. For the latter group, any significant predictors of pre-post gain
would reflect only the test-retest effect.
A second limitation stems from the fact that the research sample comes from a fully
online-administered trial and not a controlled laboratory setup. This makes it impossible to control
for environmental factors (e.g. loud background) or to ensure that participants perform the tasks the
way they were intended. However, Germine et al. (2012) found that studies conducted online need
not systematically differ from traditional lab-based studies in terms of a reduction in data quality,
even for demanding cognitive and perceptual experiments. Additionally, apart from the problem of
not being able to control for all relevant factors following online-administered trials, studies have
shown that near transfer gains might be reduced if the study instructions are not provided by a
supervisor in a real-life setting (Schwaighofer et al., 2015). It is possible that more task-specific
near transfer gains could have been achieved amongst the participants, increasing the power to
detect significant predictors, if the study had been conducted in a laboratory-like setting with a real
supervisor. Whether this is the case is debatable, however, as one meta-analysis found no difference

27

in training outcomes between conducting a WM training program at home or in a laboratory (Au et
al., 2014).
A third limitation concerns the way some predictor variables were obtained in the
present study. WM baseline performance level was selectively determined based on the average
baseline performance level on the three task-specific near transfer tasks at focus here, and not on all
the available WM tasks in the pre-test. It is possible that the inclusion of more WM baseline task
scores to the predictor variable composite would have led to different results in the multiple
regression analysis 3. Moreover, the strategy use measure was determined by having the participants
write down whether they used any strategies and what type of strategy they used. For this variable
to be accurate, it required the participants to have the energy and will to thoroughly record this even
though it was possible to proceed with the study without doing so. As the pre-test was rather long
(approximately 2 hours) and the questions on strategy use appeared multiple times, some
commitment to the study might have been required in order to answer in a detailed way every time.
Mccaul et al. (1987) found a link between commitment and performance, as they noticed that
commitment to a task or a goal has motivational properties that increase effort. Since the
participants received monetary compensation, which has been shown to reduce intrinsic motivation
and be less beneficial for the WM training (Deci et al., 1999; Jaeggi et al., 2013), some participants
might have taken the easy way out and answered in an undetailed fashion. Apart from strategy use,
the subjective measures motivation and alertness can also be criticized, as they were assessed with
quite minimal methods. Both variables were based on data stemming from only one pre-test Likert
scale question. With only one question to map the variables, no reliability or internal consistency
could be determined. Additionally, when using only one Likert scale question, the risk for
participants who “sit on the fence” increases. These are individuals who find it hard to determine
their opinion and thus, choose the option in the middle (Brown, 2000). Having the scales ranging
from one to five in the present study allowed for a so called “neutral” answer, as number three
appeared exactly in the middle. An alternative way to assess motivation and alertness could be to
use for example, the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale (MCMS; Posch et al., 2019)
and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS; Shahid et al., 2011). The MCMS was developed
specifically to measure subjective motivation in the context of crowdworking and is rather short, as
3

Indeed, in an unpublished study performed in parallel and independently of the present work, Fellman and
colleagues found a magnification effect of WM baseline performance level on task-specific near transfer when
analyzing the same data set as in the present study. This is possibly related to the fact that they used the average
baseline score of all 10 WM tasks when compiling the predictor variable, thus not only including n-back tasks that are
typically deemed as more difficult ones. Moreover, they used a different analysis method and also included the
intermediate test in their statistical model, making any direct comparison between these two studies more difficult.

28

the scale only contains 18 items. The MCMS has been demonstrated to be both valid and reliable,
as well as comparable across countries and income groups (Posch et al., 2019). The KSS measures
the subjective level of sleepiness and only takes five minutes to complete (Shahid et al., 2011). The
KSS has been proven to be a valid and reliable scale (Kaida et al., 2006) and could be adopted to
measure the alertness level of participants in WM training programs.

5.5 Directions for future studies
It is by now obvious that the effectiveness and usefulness of WM training programs
are far from the initial hype (Redick, 2019). The amount of studies on WM transfer effects is
already sufficient enough to conclude that the benefits of these programs are narrow (Melby-Lervåg
et al., 2016), as they mostly seem to be limited to improvements on untrained tasks structurally
similar to the trained task (Soveri et al., 2017). However, as some studies have found larger transfer
gains than others, the next thing to do is to explore why this might be the case. Based on the results
from over a decade of WM training studies, the focus should now be turned away from far transfer
and task-general near transfer, and instead zoom in on task-specific near transfer (Soveri et al.,
2017). As this type of transfer seems to exist, investigating the underlying mechanisms and
potential predictors would be essential for the future of all WM training programs. When doing so,
controlling for the test-retest effect is crucial in order to obtain a realistic view of the task-specific
near transfer occurring in WM training. Researchers should also try to avoid the inaccurate mediansplit designs and instead use more sensitive data analysis methods in order to minimize the loss of
power and a reduction of effect sizes (Moreau et al., 2016). It might also be that predictors of taskspecific near transfer effects work differently depending on the type of WM tasks applied. One
meta-analysis found correlations between the n-back task and other WM tasks to be very low
(Redick & Lindsey, 2013), while another found n-back tasks to strongly correlate with other WM
tasks at a latent level (Schmiedek et al., 2014). By increasing the number of studies applying
different task paradigms in relation to predictors of task-specific near transfer, it would be possible
to rule out whether there might be any significant differences between different WM tasks.
In this study, WM baseline performance level was the only predictor to reach
statistical significance. As the role of this predictor is still disputed, both in relation to its predictive
power on near transfer (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016) and whether a compensation effect (e.g., Hunt et
al., 2014) or a magnification effect (e.g., Foster et al., 2017) is more prominent, more research
regarding this predictor is needed. When doing so, it would be important to consider the potential
role of training dose, as the direction of the predictive power might vary depending on the amount

29

of training received. It could also be beneficial to control for other intelligence measures (e.g., fluid
intelligence), as they might interact with WM baseline performance level in relation to near transfer.
One possibility is that fluid intelligence works as a third variable in the WM training equation by
moderating both pre-test WM performance level and task-specific near transfer gains.
Other than WM baseline performance level, no other individual characteristics
included in this study were found to predict task-specific near transfer gains. Despite that, more
research on predictors of near transfer is needed for any conclusions at a meta-analytic level. As
more studies are grouped together and the sample pool increases, the risk for both type 1 and type 2
errors is reduced. A meta-analytic approach also minimizes the risk for methodological flaws
diluting the results by the principle of “one’s weakness becoming another one’s strength”. Some of
the predictors (i.e., motivation and alertness) should be improved using more sophisticated data
gathering methods (e.g. the MCMS for motivation and the KSS for alertness) as this might increase
the reliability and validity of the variables.

5.6 Conclusions
To the best of the author´s knowledge, no previous study has analyzed an equally
wide set of individual characteristics in relation to task-specific near transfer in WM training. The
predictor variables included in the analysis were age, education, gender, WM baseline performance
level, strategy use, motivation, alertness and cognition-related beliefs. Out of all eight variables,
only WM baseline performance level reached significance and predicted task-specific near transfer
gains. Individuals with a lower pre-test WM performance score showed larger task-specific near
transfer gains at post-test than those with a higher pre-test score. The present study supports the
existence of a compensation effect, where cognitively low-performing individuals show larger
transfer gains, as they might have more room to improve as compared to cognitively highperforming individuals, who are already performing at the top of their ability. In theory, this would
highlight the need for WM training programs to be tailored to suit individuals who are struggling
cognitively (e.g. individuals with an intellectual or a learning disability), as they might benefit the
most from WM training.

6. Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Prediktorvariabler för nära transfer i arbetsminnesträning

Inledning
Arbetsminnet beskrivs vanligen som förmågan att tillfälligt lagra, samt manipulera
information. Denna förmåga anses spela en central roll i många av vardagens kognitiva processer
(Baddeley, 1992; Miyake & Shah, 1999). Forskare har under det senaste decenniet aktivt debatterat
över huruvida det är möjligt att med hjälp av arbetsminnesträning förbättra individers
arbetsminneskapacitet. Målet har varit att hitta s.k. transfer effekter, där en förbättring i den tränade
uppgiften även leder till en förbättring i andra, otränade uppgifter. I praktiken skulle detta betyda att
man generellt kunde förbättra människors kognitiva kapacitet (Redick, 2019). Dock har man i
övergripande meta-analyser kunnat konstatera att arbetsminnesträningsprogram inte är så effektiva
som man ursprungligen antagit (Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Soveri et al., 2017). En signifikant
förbättring har endast enhetligt noterats i så kallade uppgiftsspecifika nära transfer uppgifter, vars
struktur är likadan som den uppgift man tränat med (Soveri et al., 2017). Trots att
arbetsminnesträning verkar leda till en signifikant förbättring i en begränsad mängd otränade
uppgifter så har man inom denna förbättring observerat stora interindividuella skillnader. Med
andra ord verkar vissa individer dra mera nytta av arbetsminnesträningen än andra (Karbach &
Verhaeghen, 2014; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Soveri et al., 2017). Även om metodologiska brister i
studieupplägget kan ansvara för en del av skillnaden, så kan möjligen deltagarnas individuella
karaktärsdrag förklara en annan del av variansen (Guye et al., 2017). Trots
arbetsminnesträningsforskningens popularitet, så har väldigt få studier beaktat individuella
karaktärsdrag som en eventuell förklaringsmodell för diskrepansen i tidigare studieresultat.
Ett par karaktärsdrag som i tidigare studier relativt frekvent beaktats i förhållande till
arbetsminnesträning är grundnivå på arbetsminnesprestation (t.ex. Borella et al., 2017) och ålder
(t.ex. Melby-Lervåg, 2016). Basnivå på arbetsminnesprestation har relativt robust bevisgrund som
prediktorvariabel för nära transfer, trots att forskare är delade om det rör sig om en
kompensationseffekt (Hunt et al., 2014) eller en magnifikationseffekt (Foster et al., 2017). En
kompensationseffekt betyder att de individer som är kognitivt lågpresterande får mera effekt ut av
träningen eftersom de möjligen har mera utrymme för förbättring. En magnifikationseffekt tyder
däremot på att de som redan är kognitivt högpresterande blir ännu starkare då de möjligen använder

31

sin kognitiva förmåga mera fördelaktigt (Borella et al., 2017). Dock verkar det även som att ålder
partiellt hänger ihop med grundnivån på arbetsminnesprestation. Forskare har nämligen konstaterat
att en normal kognitiv nedgång sker i samband med ökad ålder och att denna kognitiva nedgång
delvis berör arbetsminnets funktioner (Deary et al., 2009). I enstaka arbetsminnesträningsstudier har
man också observerat en magnifikationseffekt, där både en yngre ålder och en högre grundnivå på
arbetsminnesprestation resulterat i mera transfer (Borella et al., 2017). Dock är ålder som en
ensamstående prediktorvariabel tveksam eftersom man i majoriteten av studier inte funnit att denna
variabel skulle förutspå prestationen i transferuppgifter (Melby- Lervåg, 2016; Soveri et al., 2017).
Andra prediktorvariabler som spekulerats kunna ansvara för variansen i
arbetsminnesträningsresultat är personlighet (Studer-Luethi et al., 2012; Urbánek & Marček, 2015),
motivation (Anguera et al., 2012), kognitionsrelaterade åsikter (Jaeggi et al., 2013), kön (Matysiak
et al., 2019), samt fritidsaktiviteter, datorkunskap och tidigare kognitiv träning (Guye et al., 2017).
Dock har dessa variabler bristfälligt stöd från enstaka studier med relativt små sampel eller
metodologiska brister. En variabel som nyligen observerats ha en central roll i arbetsminnesträning
är strategianvändning (Fellman et al., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2019; Laine et al., 2018). Trots att
strategianvändning konstaterats vara viktig för den förbättring som sker under själva träningen så
har inga tidigare studier analyserat denna variabel som en eventuell prediktorvariabel för mängden
uppvisad nära transfer.
I denna studie analyserades åtta individuella karaktärsdrag (ålder, utbildning, kön,
grundnivå på arbetsminnesprestation, strategianvändning, motivation, vakenhetsnivå och
kognitionsrelaterade åsikter) som eventuella prediktorvariabler för mängden uppgiftsspecifik nära
transfer, efterföljt ett arbetsminnesträningsprogram. På grund av begränsad tidigare forskning
angående ämnet så var denna studie explorativ ur den synvinkel att inga hypoteser lades fram.
Huvudmålet med studien var att bidra till det stora glappet i litteraturen gällande den potentiellt
signifikanta rollen individuella karaktärsdrag har i arbetsminnesträning.

Metod
Det analyserade datat i studien var en del av en nätbaserad och randomiserad, samt
kontrollerad studie av Fellman et al. (2020), där strategianvändning i arbetsminnesträning
undersöktes. Den ursprungliga studien godkändes av den etiska nämnden för psykologi och
logopedi vid Åbo Akademi i enlighet med Helsingforsdeklarationen. I den ursprungliga studien
deltog 258 deltagare men deltagarna delades efter pretestet in i två olika träningsgrupper och en

32

kontrollgrupp. Denna studie fokuserade endast på deltagarna i en av grupperna, dvs. den
traditionella träningsgruppen, vars träningsupplägg starkast påminde om upplägget i andra
arbetsminnesträningsstudier (Soveri et al., 2017).
Samplet i den traditionella träningsgruppen bestod av 113 individer som alla efter
pretestet utförde en tolv sessioner lång träningsperiod under loppet av fyra veckor, ett mellantest i
mitten av träningsperioden, samt ett posttest i slutet. Träningsuppgiften bestod av en sifferversion
av n-back testet (ett standardmått på arbetsminne, där man ska lagra och uppdatera stimulusserier).
Uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer mättes med hjälp av en bokstavs-, en färg- och en spatialversion av nback testet. Det standardiserade medeltalet av dessa tre transferuppgifter utgjorde den beroende
variabeln.
Den statistiska analysen utfördes med hjälp av IBM SPSS Statistics 26. En preliminär
Pearsons korrelationsanalys genomfördes med prediktorvariablerna och den beroende variabeln
inkluderade. De åtta prediktorvariablernas förmåga att förutspå uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer
analyserades med hjälp av multipla regressionsanalyser. En alfa-nivå på p < .05 applicerades i alla
analyser. För att minska risken för variabelöverlapp så delades variablerna in i tre olika grupper;
demografiska variabler (ålder, utbildning, kön) kognitiva variabler (grundnivå på
arbetsminneprestation, strategianvändning) och subjektiva variabler (motivation, vakenhetsnivå och
kognitionsrelaterade åsikter). Alla regressionsmodeller granskades mot de statistiskt viktiga
antagandena för en multipel regressionsanalys innan resultaten granskades (Williams et al., 2013).

Resultat
Resultaten från Pearsons korrelationsanalys (se tabell 5) uppvisade några statistiskt
signifikanta korrelationer. Av alla prediktorvariabler så korrelerade endast grundnivån på
arbetsminnesprestation med uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer på så sätt att en lägre grundnivå hängde
ihop med en större grad transfer. Grundnivån på arbetsminnesprestation korrelerade även
medelstarkt med strategianvändning och sambandet var positivt. Motivation och vakenhetsnivå
uppvisade en stark positiv interkorrelation och dessa två prediktorvariabler uppvisade även en
medelstark negativ korrelation med kognitionsrelaterade åsikter. Med andra ord, ju mera
motiverade och vakna deltagarna kände sig, desto mindre kognitionsrelaterade problem beskrev de
sig ha. Andra svaga korrelationer existerade mellan ålder och motivation (positiv), utbildning och
strategianvändning (positiv), samt ålder och kognitionsrelaterade åsikter (negativ).

33

Av de tre multipla regressionsanalyserna så var det endast modellen med de kognitiva
prediktorvariablerna (grundnivån på arbetsminnesprestation och strategianvändning) som statistiskt
signifikant förutspådde uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer (se tabell 7). Varken modellen med de
demografiska (ålder, utbildning & kön; se tabell 6) eller de subjektiva (motivation, vakenhetsnivå &
kognitionsrelaterade åsikter; se tabell 8) prediktorvariablerna kunde förutspå prestationsförbättring
på uppgiftsspecifika nära transfer uppgifter. Modellen med de kognitiva prediktorvariablerna kunde
däremot signifikant förklara 15 % av variansen. Inom modellen nådde bara grundnivån på
arbetsminnesprestation signifikans och variabelns relation med uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer var
negativ så att en lägre grundnivå på arbetsminnesprestation förutspådde större förbättring.

Diskussion
Målet med studien var att beakta huruvida individuella karaktärsdrag bidrar till att
förklara de inkonsekventa studieresultat som nåtts gällande nära transfer. Åtta karaktärsdrag (ålder,
utbildning, kön, grundnivå på arbetsminnesprestation, strategianvändning, motivation,
vakenhetsnivå och kognitionsrelaterade åsikter) analyserades som potentiella prediktorvariabler för
uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer med hjälp av multipla regressionsanalyser. Denna typ av transfer
utgjordes av otränade varianter av n-back testet (n-back med bokstäver, färger och block) som till
sin struktur påminde om träningsuppgiften (n-back med siffror).
Prediktorvariablerna analyserades som tre skilda variabelgrupper i tre separata
modeller: demografiska variabler (ålder, utbildning, kön), kognitiva variabler (grundnivån på
arbetsminnesprestation, strategianvändning) och subjektiva variabler (motivation, aktivitetsnivå,
kognitionsrelaterade åsikter). Endast modellen med de kognitiva variablerna nådde signifikans och
kunde förutspå uppgiftsspecifik transfer. Varken modellen med de demografiska eller de subjektiva
variablerna förutspådde träningsframgång, vilket överensstämmer med existerande litteratur
(Anguera et al., 2012; Hunt et al., 2014; Karbach & Verhaeghen, 2014; Soveri et al., 2017). I
modellen med de kognitiva variablerna inkluderade, nådde endast grundnivån på
arbetsminnesprestation signifikans på så sätt att en lägre grundnivå resulterade i mera
uppgiftsspecifik transfer. Detta överensstämmer med den kompensationseffekt som observerats i
flertalet studier (Borella et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2014), där kognitivt lågpresterande individer
uppvisat mera nära transfer, möjligen eftersom de har mera utrymme för förbättring (Borella et al.,
2017). Strategianvändning kunde däremot inte förutspå transfer. Detta indikerar på att den
bevisligen centrala rollen strategianvändning har i arbetsminnesträning verkar begränsa sig till

34

själva träningen, där strategianvändning starkt ihopkopplats med förbättring i träningsuppgiften
(Fellman et al., 2020; Gathercole et al., 2019; Laine et al., 2018; Soveri et al., 2017). Med andra ord
så verkar individer stå på samma grundnivå gällande, för uppgifterna gynnsam, strategianvändning i
början av träningsprogrammet. Detta överensstämmer med konstaterandet om att
arbetsminnesträning involverar inlärning av en helt ny förmåga (Gathercole et al., 2019).
De praktiska implikationerna av resultaten i studien kunde möjligen innefatta
användandet av arbetsminnesträning som rehabiliteringsprogram för kognitivt lågpresterande (t.ex.
individer med intellektuell nedsättning eller inlärningssvårigheter), eftersom individer med lägre
arbetsminnesprestation verkar dra mera nytta av träningen. Dock anses den allmänna
generaliseringen från träningsfärdighet i arbetsminnesuppgifter till vardagslivet vara bristfällig,
vilket skapar tveksamhet gällande arbetsminnesträningens nytta och effektivitet (Redick, 2019).
Problemet med det faktum att basnivån på arbetsminnesprestation verkar vara den enda av de åtta
prediktorvariabler som förutspår träningsframgång, är att denna variabel kräver ett testbatteri för att
kunna fastslås. Därmed uppstår frågan huruvida det är värt att utföra en storskalig kognitiv
kartläggning över människors arbetsminnesprestation för att sedan enbart välja en subgrupp
individer för själva arbetsminnesträningen, vars arbetsminnesprestation är under en viss nivå.
Trots flertalet styrkor i studien så existerar det även ett fåtal brister. Först och främst
kontrollerade man inte för test-retest effekten (träningseffekten), vilket leder till en överestimering
av mängden uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer bland deltagarna. En del av förbättringen kan således
härledas till att testbatteriet vid posttestet var bekant från tidigare (Lemay et al., 2004). En annan
brist härstammar från att forskningsprojektet utfördes som en nätbaserad studie, vilket gjorde det
omöjligt att i praktiken kontrollera för eventuella omgivningsfaktoriella brister som möjligen
påverkat prestationen (t.ex. ljudnivå i bakgrunden). En tredje brist att beakta berör sättet hur viss
variabeldata samlades in. Strategianvändningsvariabeln baserades på subjektiva beskrivningar av
vald strategi, där kvaliteten på beskrivningarna möjligen påverkats av deltagarnas engagemang.
Mccaul et al. (1987) observerade att engagemang verkar hänga ihop med prestation så att mera
engagemang leder till en bättre prestation, vilket i denna studie möjligen betytt att vissa individer
inte haft energi att ge en detaljerad och sanningsenlig beskrivning. Insamlingsmetoden för
prediktorvariablerna motivation och vakenhetsnivå kan även kritiseras för att ha genomförts med
relativt minimala metoder. Bägge två baserade sig enbart på en separat fråga gällande hur motiverad
och hur vaken individen kände sig.
Framtida studier kunde fortsätta fokusera på olika individuella karaktärsdrag i
förhållande till uppgiftsspecifik nära transfer, med särskilt fokus på grundnivån på

35

arbetsminnesprestation. Detta skulle möjliggöra skapandet av robusta meta-analytiska slutsatser
gällande den potentiella roll individuella karaktärsdrag spelar i arbetsminnesträning. På det här
sättet kunde man nå fram till en fundamental förståelse för arbetsminnesträningens alla mekanismer
och således dra välinformerade beslut gällande deras potentiella användningsområde i praktiken.

PRESSMEDDELANDE
Människors arbetsminnesförmåga verkar förutspå framgång i arbetsminnesträning,
Pro gradu-avhandling i psykologi
Fakulteten för humaniora, psykologi och teologi, Åbo Akademi
Resultaten från en pro-gradu avhandling i psykologi vid Åbo Akademi tyder på att grundnivån på
människors arbetsminnesprestation kan förutspå vem som drar mest nytta av arbetsminnesträning.
Det verkar som att individer med lägre arbetsminnesprestation uppnår en förbättring i större grad,
jämfört med de som redan presterar på hög nivå före träningsprogrammet. Även andra
karaktärsdrag beaktades men de visade sig inte förutspå träningsframgång. Dessa karaktärsdrag var
ålder, utbildning, kön, strategianvändning, motivation, aktivitetsnivå och kognitionsrelaterade
åsikter. I studien deltog 113 vuxna individer, vars prestation mättes före och efter ett internetbaserat
arbetsminnesträningsprogram på tolv sessioner. Träningsframgången mättes som mängden
förbättring på otränade uppgifter, som till strukturen är identiska med den tränade uppgiften (även
kallat nära transfer). Resultatet från avhandlingen bidrar till den hektiska debatten angående
arbetsminnesträningens nytta och effektivitet.
Avhandlingen utfördes av Reidar Nervander under handledning av professor Matti Laine (Åbo
Akademi), forskare Daniel Fellman (Umeå Universitet) och doktorand Liisa Ritakallio (Åbo
Akademi).
