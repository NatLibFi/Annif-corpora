Title: Techniques of political marketing: a social constructionist perspective on news
distribution as a part of the peace process in Colombia - perceptions of the impact of fake news
and misinformation
Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
Abstract:
Colombia is a corrupt nation that remain one of the most dangerous countries in the world for
journalists and activists. Colombia is a country where misinformation and fake news have
characterized the society to a large extent for a long time, and today’s globalized and digitalized
media landscape make it easier than ever before for institutions and authoritarian leaders with
an agenda to spread propaganda.
The aim of this thesis is to map and analyse perceptions of how communication of political
agenda, in the form of fake news and misinformation, has affected the political climate and
democracy during the (ongoing) peace process in Colombia.
The theoretical frame of reference focuses on three subject areas: social constructionism,
political communication, and fake news. The empirical part of the thesis consists of secondary
data based on previous research, statistics, and netnography, and primary data from 9 individual
interviews conducted with Colombian citizens (all experts in the subject area), and extracts from
meetings with former FARC-combatants.
Through a social constructionist approach this thesis aimed to explain why communication
political agenda is understood differently in different parts of the Colombian society.
The analysis of the empirical research established that there is no general common consensus in
Colombia to what the history of the country and what the fundamental problems are to why
Colombia has been in conflict for over 50 years. In other words, there are many different
subjective truths, and hence, the political communication understood distinctly throughout the
country.
The results of this research established that fake news is used as an unethical marketing tool to
counteract transparent fact-based communication, due to financial and/or political agenda. Fake
news has been a way of discrediting the peace agreement and delegitimizing the actors, thus,
limiting their future political possibilities, and further deepening the polarization in the country.
The results of the research states that fake news and misinformation are challenges affecting the
attempt(s) to build lasting peace in Colombia.
Key words: social constructionism, political marketing, fake news, misinformation,
disinformation, predatory advertising, data-borne marketing, computational propaganda

1 Introduction

This chapter introduces the research of this thesis. The chapter provides a research
overview by presenting the problem area, the purpose, the research questions and the
aim of the thesis, the methodology, key concepts, and delimitations. The chapter ends with
a presentation of the thesis outline.

1.1 Preamble

Already in 2013, the World Economic Forum announced misinformation as a global
challenge. It has joined the family of anthropogenic climate change, increasing economic
inequality, global health problems, water supply shortage, and a range of other urgent
challenges. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017)
At times, it seems to be more important to win debates and to sell commercial and
emotional messages, than to spread facts and knowledge. Today's globalized digitized
world and media landscape make it easier than ever for authoritarian leaders, as well as
various non-democratic states, to propagate propaganda (Torrado, 2019). However, the
challenge of misinformation cannot be met only by pointing fingers at the ones creating
or paying for the creation of the content, the structural conditions creating ways for
misinformation to spread must also be examined. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017) Fake
news and misinformation are hence a very interesting and current subjects of discussion.
This thesis will discuss communication from a social constructionist perspective. It will
give an insight into political communication, media as a channel for political
communication, the impact of fake news in the political climate, and finally, the
perceptions of the societal impacts of fake news in a Colombian context during the
ongoing peace process in Colombia.

1.2 Problem area

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly changed the
nature of communication. The emerge of the New Media has provided the audience with
diverse channels of information gathering and consumption. This inevitably comes with
diverse influences on the audience. (Nwabueze & Okonkwo, 2018)
Communication in the news media today is an interplay between the content creator, the
channel in which the information is communicated, and the audience. (UNESCO, 2018).
According to Silverman (2017) a functioning democracy requires criticism, transparency,
and consequences for journalistic mistakes. Furthermore, it requires that we should be
able to collectively distinguish the truth from fabrications and deception.
The problem is not (exclusively) about not having access to reliable news or other content.
The huge amount of information circulating in the media, the audience’s capability to be
critical to the sources, and the way information is communicated is new and distressing.
Disinformation is an emerging global problem that confronts societies in general, but
specifically the communication landscape (UNESCO, 2018). One definition of fake news
is: “News articles that are intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead readers”.
(Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 213). The extent to which fake news is circulating in media
channels today is alarming. They play an important role in the political climate, the
development of the news media and, consequently, they affect democratic processes.
(Silverman, 2017)

1.3 Research questions and aim of the thesis

The aim of this thesis is to map and analyse perceptions of how communication of
political agenda, in the form of fake news and misinformation in various media channels,
has affected the political climate and the democracy during the (ongoing) peace process
in Colombia.
This thesis thus intends to create a coherent and profound theoretical understanding of
political communication, fake news, and social constructionism. The empirical research
focuses on the dissemination of political communication, in the form of fake news and
misinformation, by analysing perceptions by Colombian citizens and experts in the
subject area, of how it has affected the political climate and the democratic processes
during the (ongoing) peace process in Colombia.
The theory of social constructionism lends itself well to the discussion of the microlevel
(words, images, actions) and the macrolevel (structures, institutions) processes (Littlejohn
& Foss, 2009), and was hence chosen as the theoretical and empirical approach for this
thesis.
The research questions are established as:
1. In the context of the ongoing peace process in Colombia, what are fake news and what
is their societal impact?
2. How can the different perceptions of communicated political agenda in Colombia be
understood from a social constructionism perspective?
3. Can fake news be understood as the unethical application of marketing methods to the
political spectrum?

1.4 Methodology

The data collection has been done through a mixed-method research, by conducting semistructured and unstructured interviews and analysing previous research and secondary
data. Social constructionism has been used as both a theoretical and empirical approach.
Secondary data was collected from literature, academic journals, scientific articles, and
internet sources that support the subject areas in this thesis. The analysis of secondary
data and other previous research serve to support the primary data collected.
Eriksson and Kovalainen (2008) state that interviewing is a productive method to gather
data when one wants to study people’s experiences regarding a specific matter. The
empirical part of the investigation consists of nine individual in-depth interviews with
Colombian citizens who have worked and/or lived through the conflict first-hand.
Journalist, university professors and other professionals were interviewed, to give a
thorough insight in the political climate and the impact of misinformation on the
Colombian society during the ongoing peace process. Former guerrilla-combatants and
the former vice-president of Colombia were also interviewed to even further broaden the
understanding of the structural conditions in Colombia, and to provide a first-hand insight
on the processes that have been implemented during the peace process. The informants
in this thesis have different experiences and perspectives on the current issues but are all
deeply connected to the subject matter. The data collected is based on the informants’
personal and professional experiences, observations, and life-situations. Hence, the social
constructionism approach.
The interviews were conducted in the informants’ own language, recorded, and/or written
down, translated, transcribed, and categorized to support the analysis process. (Bryman
& Bell, 2013) The gathering of data was made between March 2018 and June 2020, which
is reflected in an image overlapping a development of the situation.
The results are based on a compilation of the thesis’s empirical results and the theoretical
frame of reference.

1.5 Delimitations

The theory presented in this thesis is restricted to focus on two main subject areas:
Political

communication

(marketing)

and

Fake

News

(misinformation

and

disinformation). The empirical part of the research investigates perceptions on the effects
of fake news and its societal implications in the Colombian context during the peace
process.
The data collection has been done partly through interviews and personal communication
first-hand, and partly through the gathering of secondary data and previous research on
the subject area.
Only Colombian citizens and people who have a direct link to the peace process and the
Colombian media, were chosen to take part in the interviews (presented in chapters 6 and
7). All informants were born and raised in Colombia in respect to the social
constructionist approach, building an understanding of Colombian perceptions on the
peace process in Colombia. This was an important limitation made to find clear
connections, relationships, patterns, and deviations more easily without the risk of
interfering cultural differences.

1.6 Key concepts

Social constructionism: According to Gergen (1985) Social constructionism views
discourse about the world as an artifact of communal interchange, rather than as a map or
reflection of the world. Social constructionism aims to place knowledge within the
process of social interchange.
Political marketing: The general method of political communication. Political marketing
is unidirectional communication (for example advertising). (Maarek, 1995)
Fake News: “News articles that are intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead
readers.” (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 213)
Misinformation: Unintentional sharing of false information. (Wardle, 2017)
Disinformation: Information that is known to be false, created deliberately and shared.
(Wardle, 2017)
Predatory advertising: When personal information such as demographics, habits,
interests, zip codes and consumer preferences, are used to target ads, specifically to
people under economic and social pressure. (O’Neil, 2016)
Data-borne marketing: Data-borne marketing is usually exploited in campaigns and
elections. If one knows the voters’ profiles, it is much easier to seduce, persuade and
manipulate them, hence make them stay on election day or influence which candidate
they vote for. With the right data it is possible to modify behaviour and possibly even
influence election results. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017)
Computational propaganda: Automated accounts, bots, trolls, identity, and profile
thefts on social networks, with the intention of adding emotions to the trending topic of
feelings shared by a county, state, or nation. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)

1.7 Disposition

Chapter 2 presents social communication that was used as a research approach in this
thesis. Chapters 3 and 4 present the literature review. The theoretical framework is built
upon three subject matters: A social constructionist approach to communication, political
marketing, and Fake News. The theoretical framework is structured to support the
purposes/objectives of this thesis.
FIGURE 1 THE DISPOSITION OF THE THESIS

In chapter 5 the method of research is presented. Chapter 6 provides an insight in the
history of the Colombian conflict and the ongoing peace process. Chapter 7 presents the
data that is analysed in chapter 8. Chapter 9 presents the results of the research, answers
the research questions, followed by recommendations for future research.

2 A social constructionist perspective on communication

This chapter defines social constructionism as a communication theory and discusses why
social constructionism lends itself well as a research approach when analysing
perceptions of political communication and the spread of fake news and misinformation.

2.1 Social Constructionism

” Although the media may be dominant, they are not omnipotent” - Peter Steven (2003)
There are several ways to understand communication. A purely theoretical approach
includes a sender, a message, noise, and a receiver. All communication is about
interpretation, in other words, people can understand the message in distinct ways even
if what they hear is the same. (Fiske, 1997)
One implication of the social constructionist theory is that the social reality requires
interaction between people (Littlejohn & Foss, 2009). Social Constructionism sees the
language, the communication and the speech as having the central role of the interactive
process through which we understand ourselves and the world. (Galbin, 2014) In other
words, construction is social as it requires collaborative rather than individual effort.
According to social constructionism, all that exist in the social world is a result of words
and actions of people interacting. Bringing something, making something, or building
something into being that had no existence previously, is central to social
constructionism. Each culture and social group develop its own understanding of the
world and creates its own meanings for behaviour, and how it is to be understood. Social
actors develop a concept and then figure out ways to make it concrete. It is necessary to
actively maintain a social construction for it to remain viable, otherwise it will be ignored
and dissolve as it is no longer conceived as relevant. Every generation maintains or

8

Emma Saarela
reaffirms some parts of the social world, recreating, discarding, or repairing other parts.
(Littlejohn & Foss, 2009)
“Constructionism stands in striking contrast to several hundred years of Western thought
that views knowledge as built up from the individual’s observations and rational
thought.” – Gergen (2006, p. 2)
Social constructionism is, without denying the influence of genetical heritance,
concentrating on investigating the social influences on communal and individual life.
According to social constructionism we all see the same world differently. Each of us
creates our own perceptions of the actual world, hence, we will never know what is
universally true or false, what is right or wrong, or/and good or bad. Social
constructionism thus abandons the idea that the individual’s mind represents a mirror of
reality. (Galbin, 2014)
Social constructionism is sometimes called a movement, at other times a position, a
theory, a theoretical orientation, or an approach. Social constructionism challenges most
of our common-sense knowledge of ourselves and the world we live in. Anthropologists
would call the subject of study culture, whereas sociologists would call it society. Social
constructionism emphasizes the complexity and the interrelatedness of the many facets
of individuals in their own communities. As mentioned above, language is considered an
essential tool in social construction, hence, any type of speech is interpreted as a social
construction from a cultural consensus. (ibid.)
According to McLeod (1997) the modern self is not seen as an entity, but a construction
and understanding, and can therefor only be achieved in a careful analysis of the cultural
and historical context of social life. According to the same author (1997), social
constructionism should be viewed as a social and cultural postmodern movement that is
attempting to move beyond modernism. Social constructionism finds that any way of
making sense of the self is socially constructed and can be understood as originating from
a set of cultural, social, and historical conditions. Social constructionists attempt to
develop ‘local knowledges’, where theory and practice are closely integrated. (McLeod,
1997)

Emma Saarela
“A great deal of human life exists as it does due to social and interpersonal influences”.
- Gergen (1985, p 265)
Many things have social reality without having prior physical existence, such as social
roles, religions, and relationships. Additionally, people create social meanings for the
physical world. Social actors invent stories, arguments, and conversations, as well as
understandings of the significance of these and other “social productions”. (Littlejohn &
Foss, 2009)
Berger and Luckman (1996), who first introduced social constructionism in 1966, state
that the individual is born with a predisposition towards sociality. Hence, one is not born
a member of society, but becomes one. Human beings create and sustain all social
phenomena through social practises.
Berger and Luckman (1966) see three fundamental processes as responsible for the
creation of social phenomena: internalization, objectivation and externalization.
FIGURE 2 GENERIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM THEORY IN PRACTICE BASED ON
THE LITERATURE REVIEW1

People externalize when they act in the world. For example: They have an idea or a
message and externalize it by writing an article. This article then enters the social realm
as other people read and re-tell the article, and slowly the article (or more so; the idea)
1

Emma Saarela
begins to take on a life of its own. For people, the idea has become an object of
consciousness in the society (objectivation) – and has developed a factual truth or
existence and it seems to be independent from the constructive work of and interaction of
people. Ultimately, future generations are born into a world where this idea already exists.
Hence, they internalize it as a part of their consciousness and as a part of their
understanding of the world. (Galbin, 2014)
According to Littlejohn and Foss (2009) one can, with a social constructionist approach,
for example study how people use words when describing race, or the roles individuals
of different races have been given in the media and reveal how racism has been
maintained and how it could, in theory, be dismantled.

2.2 Social constructionism in politics

Political communication theory explains the processes in which appointed leaders and
elected representatives, the media, and the citizenry, use messages to create opinions
about political parties. Messages and interactions are a strategic means for influencing
public policies when people exercise power in support of public interest. The
conceptualization of who it is that has the power, and how the power is exercised, is
prevalent in political communication theories. (Littlejohn & Foss, 2009)
The constructionist theory evolves from symbolic interaction. This is the social theory on
how reality is created by people reflecting on and using symbols in social interactions.
The meaning of political symbols surfaces through social interactions and is dependent
on the content expressed through written, spoken, aural and visual messages. Symbolic
interaction would according to this theory, promote self-understanding, social knowledge,
and informative clarification relevant to political communication theory. (ibid.)
Social constructionism implies that there are no real external bodies that can be
apprehended or mapped. We can therefore not see ourselves as knowers or assume that
there are facts that we can come to know. “Facts”, among other assumptions and ideas,
are social constructions. (Tandoc et.al.,2017)
11

Emma Saarela
Our societies are run by politics, whether the structure is dictatorial or democratic, or
something else. The theoretical relationship is communal, where the citizens come first
whilst stiving for maximum social, economic, and environmental welfare. According to
social constructionism, everyone views the artifact reality distinctly. Hence, protecting
and bringing forward different (read: your own) interest becomes central. In a democracy
this is primarily done by electing representatives that comply with one’s values. Bringing
forward political interests and candidates require communication, and in a political sphere
that implies political marketing. Social construction theory focuses on the practices by
which people jointly construct their understanding of the world. Social constructionists
imply that meanings are developed in coordination with others, and hence, the social
fabric is woven. Social construction theory, or social constructionism, lends itself well to
the discussion of the connection between the microlevel (words, images, actions) and the
macrolevel processes (structures, institutions). (Littlejohn & Foss, 2009)

3 Political Marketing

This chapter begins with describing the meaning of the concept of political marketing and
the differences from, and similarities with, commercial marketing, followed by a
discussion of political manipulation and the worrying trends in the modern political
communication landscape.

3.1 Modern political marketing

According to Kotler (2017, p. 4):” Marketing is managing profitable customer
relationships. The two-fold goal of marketing is to attract new customers by promising
superior value and keep and grow current customers by delivering satisfaction.” Maarek
(1995) defines traditional (commercial) marketing as the set of means by which a business
venture may maintain, develop, or create its market and clientele.
Marketing is, apart from ‘telling and selling’, the art of “satisfying customer needs”.
Every brand on a market needs to differentiate and position itself in the marketplace by
increasing their value proposition, hence offering a set of benefits or values that it delivers
to the customers to satisfy their needs. The traditional marketing strategy-steps include
production, product, selling, marketing, and societal marketing (short-run wants and longrun welfare). (Kotler, 2017)
Lees-Marshment (2009) states that politics can be viewed as a product (even if many do
not like this idea since it brings with its connotations of commodification and
consumerisation). The political party product is an evolving and complex phenomenon,
which varies from one electoral area to another. Commercial marketing methods offer
political parties the possibility to address diverse voter concerns and needs through
marketing analysis, planning, implementation, and control of political and electoral
campaigns (O’Cass, 1996).

13

Emma Saarela
The [marketing] concept of sensitively serving and satisfying human needs… provides a
useful concept for all organisations. All organisations are formed to serve the interest of
particular groups: hospitals serve the sick, schools serve the students, governments serve
the citizens, and labour unions serve the members… Marketing is that function of the
organisation that can keep in constant touch with the organisation’s customers, read their
need, develop “products” that meet these needs, and build a program of communications
to express organisation’s purposes. (Kotler & Levy, 1969, p. 15, as citated by LeesMarshment, 2009)

Maarek (1995) defines political marketing as the general method of political
communication. Political marketing is not only about ‘political campaigning’, but it also
extends well beyond what is usually claimed. O’Cass (1996) defines political marketing
as the analysis, planning, implementation and control off political electoral programmes
that are designed to create, build and maintain beneficial exchange relationships between
a political party and a voter, for the purpose of achieving the political marketers
objectives.
According to Lees-Marshment (2009) political parties are nowadays acting like
businesses, using market intelligence to inform and communicate the design of the
political product they are offering, becoming market- (or voter-) oriented, rather than
focusing on selling.
According to Lee-Marshment (2009), there are many potentials of political marketing.
Using political marketing tools, politics potentially become more responsive. People are
more individualistic, sophisticated, and knowledgeable than ever before, and should
therefore be the guiding principle of understanding the trends all around the world.
Marketing tools can even be used to enhance democracy, through marketing research by
understanding the concerns of smaller groups in society that would otherwise have been
neglected. By ensuring that politicians are more aware of the public opinion, it will
encourage greater consideration of the public’s views and reduce elite domination of the
political process. E-marketing offers the potential of a more effective consolation and
discussion and continued marketing can help governments stay in touch or reconnect with
the public opinion. Furthermore, ideology can be integrated through political branding.
The general perception is that the goal of political marketing is for a politician to get
elected or re-elected. However there are other goals of political marketing, for example;
advancing a particular ideology, policy, cause, or piece of legislation, gain support from
14

Emma Saarela
new segments in the market, change the agenda in the media and the public sphere,
increasing the number and activity of volunteers, winning control of government (or
senate), becoming a coalition partner in the government, or/and finally, making the world
a better place. (Lee-Marshment, 2009)
Even if political marketing often replicates the methods of commercial marketing, it
acquires methods specific to its field. According to Maarek (1995), there are some
universal rules that should be adopted in a political marketing campaign. Primary, the
principle of coherence requires that no campaign decisions can be taken until it has been
correlated with all other decisions. A successful political marketing campaign requires
systematic re-examination of earlier campaigns. An effective campaign demands, that the
entire communication process shall be redefined – ruling out the repetition of even
successful campaigns. Another of Maarek’s (1995) principles is that of minimal
differentiation. The politician must have an advantage on a specific point, in other words,
a specific factor that differentiates him/her from his/her opponents. This advantage must
be emphasized throughout the campaign. And finally, the same author highlights the
principle of maximum security. Maximum security warns against adopting a
communication strategy that could jeopardize the candidate or the aim of the campaign,
for example, not anticipating on a future event.
Political communication is not a new phenomenon, it can be dated as far back as the
antiques. However, political marketing came with the elaboration of a policy of political
communication: a global strategy of design, rationalization, and conveyance of modern
political communication. Political marketing today, is largely held responsible for the
banalization of modern political discourse, as well as the escalating campaign costs.
Hence, the numerous critiques on political marketing. (Maarek,1995)

3.2 Manipulation of democracy

The general discourse today focuses on whether the voter preferences are shaped by
political elements or by the effects of the social environment. (Çoban & Öztürk, 2019)
Theoretical work in economics shows that under competition and diversity of opinion,
15

Emma Saarela
daily newspapers will provide content that is more biased, and that technology narrows,
rather than widens, the news audiences’ political horizons. With the new media,
individuals tend to rely on familiar comforting sources for the more attentive segments of
citizenry and are consequently less able to deliberate over questions of public policy. As
the news audience increasingly polarizes through questions of politics and ideology,
media owners stand to gain market share by injecting more, rather than less, political bias
to the news. When the audience is polarized, novel news (or “news with an edge”) makes
for market success. (Cheminant & Parrish, 2011)
Simultaneously, the less informed – who are in most need of exposure to news – will fall
further behind the more informed part of the citizenry. As an increasing number of people
fall outside the reach of news, they become less informed about current affairs and more
receptive to persuasive appeals of political elites. Exposure can thus be said to be limited
to the politically engaged strata. This consequently leads to an even less informed and
more polarized electorate. (Iyengar & Hahn, 2011)
Journalism should be based on objectivity. Today, in the new media environment, in
many parts of the world, entire cable news channels have become identified with partisan
leanings. In the new media environment, a news consumer can tailor the style and
substance of the news to fit their own ideological preferences. This consequently makes
it easier to propagate manipulation and distortion, consequently, creating a world with
little common ground, where each side in the political debate is armed with a tailored
version of the facts. (Fox & Gangl, 2011)

3.2.1 Heresthetics, overload, and rational ignorance

Manipulation is defined as “the failure of compassion”. Trading the victim’s ignorance,
or lack of attention, to a situation of choice, leaves the victim thinking that they have more
agency in the situation then they in fact do. To ensure equality, strategics must be public
and universal. Manipulation is a failure of political equality as it involves deception –
getting victims to do something they would not normally have done, something that is
contrary to their putative will. Political manipulation implies manipulation of the
circumstances of the choice, rather than the will of the choice. It is oftentimes very hard
16

Emma Saarela
to hold someone accountable for political manipulation - if there is no victim, is there a
crime? (Sahl, 2011)
Heresthetics is a political strategy that implies manipulating the structure and the context
of a decision-making process. The basic idea of heresthetics is that even when one’s
choice among alternatives is completely free, the content of the alternatives is determined.
The person that determinate the alternatives is usually a designated leader, or an agenda
setter – not the individual chooser or the one that judges the choice (usually in ignorance
of who framed the alternatives and why). (ibid.)
For most voters, the time and effort needed to make a thorough analysis, and hence, a
reasoned political choice, cost more than a voter’s perceived effect on the outcome of the
choice. Therefor many people remain clueless (rational ignorance), and consequently,
potentially exploited. The powerful can systematically use hereshetics to obscure their
own actions and avoid accountability in a way that outsiders find difficult to understand.
This can be understood as political manipulation. This is ethically and politically
worrying for empirical reasons rather than analytic reasons, because of how it works,
rather than how it is defined. (Sahl, 2011)
Another technique is political manipulation through overload that lacks distributive bias.
It is the opposite of manipulation that relies on secrecy. Overload signifies maximal
disclosure, in other words accurate and full reporting. Overload does not rely on the level
of falsifying facts, but on the level of interpreting them. People that are overloaded with
information, naturally becomes desperate for a scheme for integrating and making sense
of it, which allows for politicians to step in with an interpretive framework which supports
their own policy preferences. (Sahl, 2011) Goodin (2007, as citated by Sahl, 2011)
suggests that national security issues provide the most opportunity for this kind of
manipulation, as interpretive frames are easier to sell when the subject at hand lies outside
the audience’s experience.
Heresthetic overload implies true facts being technically public, but practically
incomprehensible. In other words, deliberately providing, or encouraging, the release of
massive amounts of information – followed by a biased frame to make sense of it. The
17

Emma Saarela
frame serving the purpose, not the audience. The information at hand concerns, not the
substance of the public issue, but the process of decision making that politicians have
deliberately set up in considering the issue. These processes are designed to obscure their
unpopular positions on the issue. Biased frames about policy indicates how politicians
are manipulating the available choices of policy. (Sahl, 2011)
Heresthetic power implies the power, not to win over votes on statistically defined issues,
but to dynamically choose, what will be voted on. This can also imply controlling the
agenda, in other words, not only influencing the agenda, but influencing which ones get
attention in the public discourse. (ibid.)
In other words, rather than propagating propaganda, at times, marketing methods are used
to shift attention to other matters to benefit the agenda setter’s policy preferences.

3.2.2 Worrying trends in the modern political communication landscape

There is a very large difference between the nature of communication strategies of the
individual political figure, and communication efforts of governments and public
institutions. In recent years, politics and the media have largely been suffering from a loss
of credibility. Politicians are in a large scale solely focusing on their personal interest and
driving so called “politician’s politics” as the media is, simultaneously, inflicting with
uncontrolled input and unverified information. (O’Cass, 1996)
Rúas and Capdevila (2017) highlights that the loss of credibility and the general lack of
trust in politicians has placed political communication in a scenario of a rising left-wing
and right-wing population, hence, a deepened polarization. This phenomenon especially
threatens to pave way in countries with leaders that are already relatively radical.
Deepened polarization due to the loss of credibility and lack of trust in politicians is a
global phenomenon, and one that has had a very strong foothold in Latin-American
countries, such as Colombia, for a long time. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)

18

Emma Saarela
Rúas and Capdevila (2017), among others, state that we are in an age of conceiving
politics as politically incorrect. This threat extends to traditional communication means,
as they are perceived as a part of the same system. The same author (2017) implies that
we are moving towards the return of the old rules of propaganda: exaggeration,
simplification, ridicule of adversary, misinformation, lies, conspiracy theories and
dissemination of hoaxes. (As defined by Domenach, 1968; referred by Rúas & Capdevila,
2017) Furthermore, defining what is true and what is false has become a common political
strategy that is replacing debates that are based on a mutually agreed sets of facts. (Tandoc
et.al., 2017)
In search of alternative audiences, politicians have embraced a way of political
entertainment and infotainment (also referred to as “politaintment” in the political
context), full of false promises and intentions, facing new dimension of political action
based on the concept of post-truth (The truth felt, perceived, and accepted as a belief or
faith). Politicians are forced to perform, which has led to a personalization of politics that
is increasingly present in digital media. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)
There is an interest in gaining control of the voting market through emotional
manipulation. Facts are less important than the sensations they produce. There is an
advent of Big Data, a new algorithm culture, that aim to gain technical control of the
voting market. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017) As indicated by Woolley and Howard (2016),
computational propaganda is now becoming one of the most important social impacts of
innovation in computer science and engineering. One of the most evident consequences
of these practices is the issue of whether one can hack the election of a president (Also
discussed and presented in the documentary “The great hack”, 2019, Netflix). There is a
new dimension to the contemporary problem of manipulation: psychological
vulnerabilities are amplified exponentially by the increasing power and complexity of the
media and other institutions. (Cheminant & Parrish, 2011)
Supported by the social constructionism theory, Rúas and Capdevila (2017), state that we
are transmitters of our cultural heritage and expressions of our social brain. Decisionmaking goes far beyond the rational calculation and evaluation of possibilities. (Ledoux,
1996). Decision- making acts below the threshold of intentionality and consciousness
(Connolly & Zeelenberg, 2002), and when in conflict, resulting in emotion, hence, clearly
overriding reasoning. This nearly post-factual age is thereby explained as “emotions over
19

Emma Saarela
reasoning” or “emotional capitalism”, where economic and emotional discourse is
designed mutually, and emotional life follows the logic of economic relations and trade,
and taken to the extreme, the implementation could lead to the tyranny of emotions,
instincts and passions, due to misgovernment – the kind that paved way for many of the
wars and dictatorships of the past. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)
The rejection by referendum of the peace agreement with the FARC guerrillas in
Colombia (October, 2016), the unexpected triumph of Donald Trump in the US
(November, 2016) presidential election, the victory of Brexit in Great Britain (June, 2016)
and, the rise of the populist parties in several European countries have, among other
events, highlighted western democracies events that contradict the electoral logic known
until now, and the role of political communication and its effects on citizenry. The current
discussion concerns the questions of to what extent the media language and political
communication (as a reflection and expression of reality) can contribute to the recovery
of confidence, the necessary democratic dialogue, and the understanding and participation
between politicians and voters, and citizens and governments. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)

4 Fake News

In this chapter the concept of Fake News is defined. This chapter discusses motivations
behind fake news, fake news and social media, how fake news spread differently than the
truth, the role of the consumer, and how misinformation can imply a threat to democracy.
At the end of this chapter (4.6), both the second, the third and the fourth chapter are
interconnected through a summary of the theoretical frame of reference.

4.1 Defining fake news

Throughout history news has been defined in numerous ways. Kershner (2005), defines
news as an “accurate account of a real event”. News can be an account of a recent,
interesting, or significant event (Kershner 2005), an account of events that have
significantly affected people (Richardson, 2007), or/and a dramatic account of something
interestingly new, unusual, or something deviant. (Jamieson & Campell, 1997) However,
factual news is an output of journalism - a field that is expected to provide “Independent,
reliable, accurate, and comprehensive information” (Kovach & Rosenstiel, 2007, p. 11)
According to Strömbäck (2003) one of the most important journalistic tasks is to examine
and review those in power. This is done through public media investigations, but also by
examining and reviewing citizens, politicians, and journalists. By examining those in
power, informing the public and allowing different views and cultural expressions to be
spoken, journalism contributes to a better functioning democracy.
A journalist you must adhere to standards, such as being accurate and objective.
Furthermore, one must acknowledge that along with the responsibility of the profession,
comes power. Journalists have an influential position in society and are often referred to
as the fourth pillar of democracy, as they are amplifying and conferring legitimacy to
what they report. (Schudson, 2003)

21

Emma Saarela
Fake news is an oxymoron since news is normatively based on truth. One definition of
fake news is “News articles that are intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead
readers.” (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017, p. 213) Fake news is also found in the larger context
of misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation, according to the UK parliament,
referring to “the inadvertent sharing of false information”, and disinformation on the
other hand, referring to “the deliberate creation and sharing of information known to be
false”. (Wardle, 2017)
Fake news is not a new concept, it reaches back centuries. In the 16th century fabricated
news where referred to as ‘false news’, in the 19th century ‘yellow journalism’ was a term
used to describe fabricated or exaggerated news stories, and was, like todays fake news,
generally connected to profit motives. The term fake news appears to have emerged in the
late 19th century. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019) A common factor for fabricated news is
that it appropriates both the look and feel of real news. Fake news intends to take on some
form of credibility by trying to appear like real news, hence hiding under a façade of
legitimacy. (Tandoc et.al., 2017)

4.1.1

Motivations behind fake news

Fake news stories have engaged and fooled millions of readers all over the world
(Silverman, 2017). Recent studies have examined the implications of fake news, not only
in terms of confusing readers (Barthel et.al.,2016), but regarding the potential for
affecting election results (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). Readers generally ignore the fake
news stories they encounter, but in a lot of cases the consumption of fake news stories
leads to tangible action (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019).
According to Tandoc, Zheng and Ling (2017), there are two main motivations that
underlie the production of fake news: the financial motivation and the ideological
motivation.
There is financial motivation behind fake news going viral and providing content-creators
with clicks that are convertible to advertising revenue. The motivation is ideological when

22

Emma Saarela
fake news stories are produced to promote ideas or people that they favour, often
discrediting others. (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017).
According to Vosoughi et.al. (2018), an active and irrelevant use of the term fake news
has polarized the political landscape and the media climate. Politicians have implemented
a political strategy of labelling news stories that do not support their standpoint as
unreliable or fake news, and sources that do support their positions as reliable or not fake.
(ibid.) Since the presidential elections in the United States in 2016 ‘fake news’ has
become a buzzword that has lost connection to the actual veracity of the information
presented. The elections were a democratic exercise marked by misinformation and
fabricated news. (Albright, 2016)
Fake news today is thus not only discussed in scholarly discourse, but also in daily
conversations, with the purpose not only to point out false information, but also (the
opposite way of acting within the framework of the concept of false news) to demonize
traditional and legitimate news organizations. All of this illustrates the importance of
understanding what the concept of fake news can stand for. (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017)

4.2 Fake news and social media

Misinformation and disinformation in the media are nothing new. They have been around
since the development of the first writing systems. (Marcus, 1993) However, the
digitalization of news has profoundly challenged the traditional definition of news.
Today, online platforms, particularly social media, are becoming the main source of news
consumption for a growing number of individuals. Consequently, misinformation and
disinformation have found new channels. Online platforms provide space for nonjournalists to reach mass audiences. This has widely challenged the link between news
and journalists due to non-journalists engaging in journalistic activities to produce
journalistic outputs, including “news”. (Robinson & DeShano, 2011)
Initially Social media was used to promote news stories (Lasorsa et.al., 2011), but it
quickly became a way to break stories and interact with the audiences (Tandoc & Vos,
2015). Social media has changed news distribution, as well as the traditional beliefs of
23

Emma Saarela
what news should look like. Twitter, as an example, is a perfect platform for quickly
disseminating details about a breaking event (Hermida, 2011). A tweet2 of 140 characters
from a person with authority is nowadays considered news (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017).
Through social media accounts users can post videos, photos, information, and narratives
about newsworthy events that they witness first- hand, hence, engaging in journalism.
(Hermida, 2011) Concurrently, journalists have followed the audience into the world of
social media.
Social media sites have a massive audience, and as they facilitate speedy exchange and
spread of information, they also facilitate the spread of misinformation. Facebook, for
example, has around 2.7 billion active monthly users according to Statista (2020), and
nowadays functions as a portal where users have the possibility to not only share personal
ideas and updates with friends, but also to consume, produce, and exchange different type
of information, such as news. Receiving information from socially proximate sources,
helps legitimate the veracity of information that is being shared on social networks. Users,
however, seldom verify the information they share -which is the very base of journalistic
work. (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017)
As each post on social media is accompanied by popularity ratings, social media increases
the bandwagon effect (the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, trends etc. increase the more
they have already been adapted by others). In other words, when a post receives many
likes, shares or/and comments, it is likely to receive even more attention from other users,
hence, more visibility that has very little to do with quality.(Tandoc et.al., 2017)
New media technologies have both enabled an increased the volume of news content and
allowed for niche marketing on a unique scale, often presenting ideologically diverged
consumers with entirely different universes of discourse. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019)
Social media fosters an environment that lends well to the propagation and spread of
unverified information, such as fake news. (Tandoc et.al., 2017)

4.2.1

Fake news spread differently than the truth

Both true and false information spread rapidly online. The success of fabricated items
often relies on pre-existing social tension. When the population have trust in an institution
or a person with authority, it is very unlikely that they would accept stories that are critical
of these actors (in other words, a false news story on these would NOT gain legitimacy).
However, if social tension exists: if there is serious sectarian, political, racial, or cultural
differences - people will be more susceptible to fabricated news (In other words, a false
news story gaining legitimacy). (Tandoc et.al., 2017)
The development of news bots 3 are adding to what the reader might interpret as
legitimacy of the item, which hence, gives legitimacy and the illusion of widespread
acceptance of a news item. A study on detecting fake websites distinguished two types of
fake news sites, one is called “spoof sites”, which imitate already existing websites, and
the other one is “concocted sites”, which are misleading websites attempting to appear as
unique, legitimate, commercial entities. (Abbasi et.al., 2010) With News Bots, fake news
exceeds the simple appearance of real news by building a network of fake sites that is
consequently undermining journalism’s legitimacy. (Kang et.al. 2011)
Two examples of fabricated news stories that gained legitimacy is one titled “Pope
Francis Endorsed Donald Trump”4. The estimation was that this fabricated news, relating
to the former president of USA, Donald Trump, was shared 30 million times. Another
fabricated news implied that Hillary Clinton was selling weapons to ISIS. This fabricated
news was shared 8 million times on Facebook. Approximately half of the people who
read and remembered these stories, also believed them to be true. (Allcott & Gentzkow,
2017)
In a study conducted by Vosoughi et.al. (2018), the research question was: “How do truth
and falsity diffuse differently, and what factors of human judgment explain these
differences?” The study is one of the first studies that comprehensively evaluates

Emma Saarela
differences in the spread of truth and falsity across topics and examines how and why
false news spread differently than the truth.
In the study, politics was the largest rumour category in the data. (45 000 cascades
followed by urban legends, business, terrorism, science, entertainment, and natural
disasters). They showed that political news travelled more broadly and deeper, reached
more people, and was more viral than any other category of false information. They also
found that falsehood diffused significantly further, faster, deeper, and more broadly than
the truth in all categories of information. Overall, a larger amount of people retweeted
falsehood than the truth. They found that falsehood was 70% more likely to get retweeted
than the truth. It also took the truth six times as long as for falsehood to reach 1500 people.
They found that users that spread false news had significantly fewer followers, followed
significantly fewer people, were less active on Twitter (the platform that the study was
focused on), were verified significantly less often, and had been on Twitter for
significantly less time. (ibid.)
The same research also showed that false rumours were significantly more unique than
the truth across all novelty metrics, displaying significantly higher information
uniqueness. (Vosoughi et.al., 2018)
It cannot be claimed that innovation causes retweets, or that innovation is the reason for
the large number of retweets of fake news. However, Vosoughi et.al. (2018), found that
fake news is more novel, and that novel information is more likely to get shared and
retweeted than the truth.

4.3 Different type of fake news

A review of 34 academic articles conducted by Tandoc, Zheng and Ling (2017), articles
that all used the term “Fake news”, between the years 2003 and 2017, resulted in a
typology of fake news: news satire, news parody, fabrication, manipulation, advertising,
and propaganda - presented in the table below. The definitions are based on two
dimensions: deception and level of facticity.
TABLE 1 TYPLOGY OF FAKE NEWS

Source: Tandoc et.al. (2017)

27

Emma Saarela
Facticity refers to the degree to which (fake) news rely on facts. The authors intention
refers to the degree to which the producer/content creator of (fake) news intends to
mislead the reader. Based on these two domains, there are four general types of fake news:
Native advertising, propaganda, manipulation, and news fabrication. (Tandoc et.al., 2017)

TABLE 2 GENERAL TYPES OF FAKE NEWS, BASED ON AUTHOR’S IMMEDIATE
INTENTION TO DECEIVE AND THE LEVEL OF FACTICITY

4.4 The role of the consumer – attention is an asset

Just a few years ago, information was much more difficult to get a hold on than it is today.
How informed one was depended on a subscription to a newspaper, heading out to buy
one, or if one had access to a library. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017) Information today
is expected to be financially free. People refuse to pay for books, entertainment products
and newspapers, as digitalization and information technology have enabled that. Today,
generally, having a smartphone is enough to obtain information: you have access to any
information of choice, weather it is news, politics, science, entertainment, or gossip.
Never has so much information been so easily accessible. (Hendricks & Vestergaard,
2017)
A large amount of money is spent on buying attention and influence on the internet, TV,
and the radio. There are generally large quantities of money in politics, but the attention
28

Emma Saarela
politicians can secure by exposure, making headlines, and influence the mass media
coverage oftentimes comes without charge. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017)
The aim of marketing is to attract and harvest attention, and ultimately, influence
behaviour. Marketing is about persuading consumer into consuming a certain product or
voting for a specific candidate. Attention is vital for all successful communication, as it
is the portal into people’s minds. Attention is the main factor in all aspects of marketing,
branding, and advertising. (Teixeira, 2014)
The challenge today is not to find information, but to find the time and the space to view
all the material at one’s disposal, as attention paid to one thing, excludes spending time
on something else. Information consumes as the audience is deflecting its attention away
from some matters, attention becomes a scarce and valuable resource. (Hendricks &
Vestergaard, 2017)
Services like Google and Facebook are not truly free of charge - that perception is a
misunderstanding of the business model and one’s role in it. Platforms are selling the
audience to advertisers, in other words, one is not the customer of Facebook or Google,
one is the product, or as Hendricks & Vestergaard (2017, p.11) stated: “If you are not
paying for the product, you are the product.” In other words, the attention merchant is
the main default business model today, as people pay with their attention. (Hendricks &
Vestergaard, 2017)
Users are being monitored as companies are making economic profit by selling
information about users to third parties. Networks, such as Google and Facebook, are
securing their profit using a business model that is based on surveillance. (Taplin, 2017)
The surveillance provides information about the users, that then can be (mis)used to trick,
manipulate, and persuade the user effectively. In a political context, gathering user data
allows for targeted advertising: if the voters’ profiles are known, it is much easier to
seduce, persuade and manipulate them, make them stay at home on election day, or
influence which candidate they should vote for. In other words, it is possible to modify
behaviour with access to the right data and, consequently, even influence election results.
(Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017) As Cathy O´Neil points out in her book Weapons of
Math Destruction (2016); if someone is in possession of someone’s personal information,
such as demographics, habits, interests, zip codes and consumer preferences, it is very
29

Emma Saarela
easy to effectively use this information to target ads, specifically to people under
economic and social pressure. The phenomenon is called predatory advertising. The idea
behind predatory advertising is to localize the most vulnerable people and use their
information against them by finding out where they hurt the most. (O’Neil, 2016)

4.5 Misinformation as a threat to democracy

“The media is the most powerful entity on Earth. They have the power to make the
innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, that’s power. Because they control the
minds of the masses.” -Malcolm X
The development of the internet has presented opportunities in many countries to
strengthened democratization. In various parts of the world internet has allowed for a
more flexible democracy as it creates openness and political participation providing wide
access to information, that undermines authoritarian regimes. The internet, and foremost
social media, has allowed marginalized voices to raise the profile of social issues
(#MeToo, #blacklivesmatter, #TimesUp). However, social media platforms are posing
significant challenges as spaces for news consumption as private corporations, that desire
markets rather than supporting democracy, are increasingly controlling the public
discourse. Hence, as social media platforms are attracting attention, newspapers have
experienced diminished sales as shrinking add revenue due to competition from the
internet. In many parts of the world this has led to less in-depth reporting and diminished
local news coverage. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019)
Media manipulation is nothing new, but the term fake news has not been a key term in
media discourse until recent years. Concerns about this concept are to be understood
withing the emerge of new technologies interconnecting with current socio-political and
economic dynamics. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019) In 2013, The World Economic
Forum stated that democratic governance is threatened by misinformation. According to
Vosoughi et.al., 2018) fake news can lead to misallocation of resources during natural
disasters and terror attack, the misalignment of business investments, and misinformed
elections.
30

Emma Saarela
Our economies are not immune to fake news either. False rumours have, among other
things, affected stock prices and motivations for investments. Our response to everything
from natural disasters to terrorist attacks is being altered by the spread of fake news
online. (Tandoc et.al., 2017). New mass-media technologies have also provided new
avenues for advertisers to reach massive audiences simultaneously which has also
increased consumerism. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019)
New mass-media technologies have always presented new opportunities for those in
positions of power to influence citizenry. Hitler, for example, used the radio for intimate
one-way communication to rally German citizens behind his nationalistic, imperial
agenda. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019) But the internet has presented a new dimension
to the contemporary problem of manipulation: psychological vulnerabilities are amplified
exponentially by the increasing power and complexity of the media and other institutions.
(Cheminant & Parrish, 2011)
A democracy is in a post-factual state when politically opportune but factually misleading
narratives form the very basis of political debate and legislation. In a worst-case scenario,
with an uncontrollable amount of accepted misinformation circulating wildly, democracy
may approach a post-factual state, consequently, political, and practical ability to address
and solve social and global challenges diminish. (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017)

31

Emma Saarela
4.6 Summary of the theory: General implications of political
communication and fake news from a social constructionist
perspective

“Propaganda, like advertising, only strikes chords when the conditions are right. For all
his ranting, Hitler could never have won widespread support if he had not been able to
exploit the multiple miseries of the depression.” (Death of truth: when propaganda and
alternative facts first gripped the world, Brendon, 2017)
According to social constructionism, people jointly construct an understanding (cultural,
social, and historical) of the world, as meanings and opinions are developed in
coordination with others and then passed on for generations. Language, communication,
and speech have a central role in making sense of the self and one’s surroundings. We are
not born a member of society – we become one. Social actors invent different narratives;
stories, arguments, and conversations, and understandings of the significance of “social
productions”. All people have distinct perceptions of the same world, in other words, we
cannot argue that there is a universal truth or something universally false.
A fundamental thought in social constructionism is the interest in representations, as they
play a central role in the construction of the social reality. In a democracy (a social
structure) our political interests are represented by (democratically) elected political
representatives who communicate their policies through political communication primarily political marketing.
Today social media platforms are the key infrastructure for political and public discourse.
Some argue that this has put open societies and democracies into a “democratic deficit”.
(UNESCO, 2018) recognizing that human beings are emotional voters and that “emotions
over reasoning”, has become the new normal.
News should, by definition, be an output of journalism, and intend to provide objective,
independent, reliable, and comprehensive information, thus, contributing to a better
functioning democracy.

32

Emma Saarela
The success of fake news often rely on pre-existing social tension, and many people have
a hard time distinguishing fake news from legitimate news, especially in remote parts of
the world where education, or other structural conditions, limit the access to information
or the prerequisites to critically examine and interpret information.
Heresthetics are used to shift the attention to benefit the agenda setter’s policy
preferences, and concurrently fake news has polarized our political environment and
media climate even further. There is so much content circulating that it tends to
overwhelm any sense of coherency. Self-selection of news content further aggravates the
issue of fake news as data -collection enables the use of predictive algorithms to pave
way for predatory marketing. Consequently, people do not know what to believe
anymore, and some, without knowing any better, believe everything they come across. It
is thus relevant to ask to which extent voter preferences depend on political elements, or
if voter preferences are merely a product of the social environment.
Social media fosters an environment that makes it easy for misinformation and fake news
to spread fast, hence, posing a real threat to communities and democracies. According to
the World Economic Forum (2019) controlling the spread of false information online
(either through laws or technology), raises questions on the limits to the freedom of
speech – a human value that is not celebrated or regarded equally across different
societies. Regulations that restrict communications platforms and activities,
indiscriminately often have insufficient alignment to the international principles requiring
that limitations on expression should be demonstrably necessary, proportional, and for a
legitimate purpose. The effect, even if not always intended, is to make news media subject
to a “ministry of truth”, with the power to suppress information for purely political
reasons (UNESCO, 2018).

5 Method

This chapter presents the method for the empirical study. The chapter begins with a
presentation of the research design and the mixed method approach, followed by a
presentation of the interview-process, the interview guide, the research quality and,
finally, an assessment of methodological limitations.

5.1 Research Design

According to Malhotra and Birks (2007) a research design serves as a framework for
conducting a marketing research project, and hence sets the foundation for the research
project. A good research design will ensure an effectively and efficiently conducted
marketing research project. A research design lines out the necessary procedures needed
to obtain the information when structuring or solving a marketing research problem.
In this thesis a case study design has been applied. According to Bryman and Bell (2011)
what distinguishes a case study design from other designs is that it entails details and
intensive study of a single case. A case study research is concerned with the nature and
complexity of the case in question; in this thesis: case Colombia. A case study often
favours qualitative methods because these methods are viewed as particularly helpful in
the generation of a detailed, intensive examination of the case. However, qualitative
methods are not precluded. A case study provides a vehicle through which both
qualitative and quantitative methods can be combined, hence, not relying on one single
approach. According to Bryman and Bell (2011) the selection of cases should be based
primarily on the anticipation of the opportunity to learn.
The research has been conducted with a social constructionism perspective, using
abductive reasoning, which implies that none of these approaches will result in one
objective result or “truth”. (Denscombe, 2017) According to Eriksson and Kovalainen
(2013) an abductive way of working is characterized by logical thinking and hence a
logical working process. In other words, the researcher moves between theory and
34

Emma Saarela
empiricism to find a logical explanation and understanding to the research problem. The
abductive way of working is a mix of an inductive and deductive research approach.

5.2 Mixed method research

A research design and a research method are not the same thing. A research method
implies the way the data have been collected. Research methods are however associated
with different research designs. (Bryman & Bell, 2013) According to Denscombe (2017)
there are four primary methods for collection of data that social scientists can use:
observation, interviews, questionnaires/surveys, previous research, and/or other written
sources. Every method has their weaknesses and strengths. What method is chosen is
primarily a question of applicability and usefulness.
None of the methods mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Often both primary and
secondary data are utilized to gain a deeper understanding of the research problem at
hand. (Denscombe, 2017) Considering the object of the case study design of this thesis,
a combination of methods was used.
Quantitative research uses numbers as units of analyses. Quantitative research usually
aims to focus on larger scale research with larger numbers and quantities. People that tend
to approach research with a quantitative method usually prefer to stay “close to the data”,
as they believe numbers speak louder and words. Quantitative research tends to be
associated with the researcher’s impartiality and the analysis of quantitative data tends to
be made after the collection of data. (Denscombe, 2017)
A qualitative research is a research approach that is focused on exploring personal
experiences with a phenomenon by collecting and analysing narrative text or data,
expressed by individuals in words or images. (Clark & Ivankova, 2016) Qualitative
research normally involves relatively few people or happenings, and the analysis of
qualitative data is often done during the collection of data. A qualitative research tends
to be associated with the researcher’s partiality. (Denscombe, 2017)

35

Emma Saarela
A mixed-method approach is a combination of different types of research within one
specific project. A mixed-method research is usually a mix of quantitative and qualitative
components, quantitative and qualitative methods, quantitative and qualitative data,
or/and quantitative and qualitative research. A mixed-method approach is usually chosen
when the researcher prefers to investigate the research issue from various perspectives.
(Denscombe, 2017) In this thesis a mixed method approach has been used.
By addressing a phenomenon through a mixed method research approach, a researcher
can produce stronger and more credible studies, thus, adding more value by
complementary and corroborating evidence on the research problem of interest. In other
words, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods within one study can help a
researcher minimize or exclude potential alternative explanations of the result.
Furthermore, a mixed method approach can provide enough information to explain the
divergent aspects of the studied phenomenon. (Clark & Ivankova, 2016)
According to Denscombe (2017) there are several advantages with a method
combination:
1) A better understanding of what is being studied
•

Validates findings and increases accuracy and provides a more comprehensive picture of the
phenomenon that is being researched.

2) A practical, problem-based approach to research
•

A more practical and problem-based than theory-based approach to the phenomenon.

3) A clearer connection between methods and the different types of data
•

A mixed-method approach emphasizes integrating alternative approaches and encourages the
researcher to provide a clear account over how and why the methods and the data complement
each other.

•

A good research with a mixed-method approach avoids all arbitrary forms of combinations.

4) Compensates strong and weak sides
•

Research strategies and research methods all have their weak and strong sides. A cleaver
combination of strategies and methods makes it possible for the researcher to take advantage
of a certain method’s strong sides, without having be vulnerable for criticism of the weak
sides.

Denscombe (2017) also establishes some of the disadvantages with a combination of
methods: The cost and duration for the research might increase, the researcher must
acquire skills in more than one method, the findings from different methods might not
36

Emma Saarela
confirm one another (prolonging the research process), and finally, the distinction
between qualitative and quantitative findings can result in a tendency of
oversimplification.
Considering the social constructionist approach, the complexity of the case study research
and, most importantly, the unique opportunity to access privileged information, semi
structured and unstructured interviews - supported by previous research and data, such as
previous interviews, official statistics, and netnography (virtual ethnography) - were
found to be the most suitable methods for this research. Thus, a mixed method approach.
Interviews, chosen as the method to collect primary data for this thesis, is a method for
collection of data that uses people’s answers to the researcher’s questions as a source of
data. The interviews focus on self-reporting, in other words, what people say they do, the
opinions they say they have, and what they say they believe. Interviews are an effective
way to study people’s experiences from their own perspective. (Denscombe, 2017)
According to Denscombe (2017), interviews are a good method to use when the purpose
is to explore complex and subtle phenomena, such as:
1) Perceptions, opinions, feelings, and experiences, where the purpose of the
research is to understand them in-depth, rather than to present them in a few
words.
2) When the research focuses on complex things that require a thorough
understanding of how things work, how factors are interconnected and how
systems work.
3) Privileged information, where there is an opportunity to speak with key- persons
on the field that can give especially valuable insight and knowledge based on their
experience or position.
The purpose of the thesis is to map perceptions of the impact of fake news in Colombia
during the peace process, from a social constructionist perspective.
Semi structured and unstructured interviews have been used as the method to collect
primary data in this thesis. Semi-structured and unstructured interviews provide an
opportunity for the interviewer to develop and change the questions during the project. In
other words, use them developmentally. (Denscombe, 2017)
37

Emma Saarela
In semi-structured interviews, the interviewer has a complete list of topics to be addressed
and questions to be answered. However, the interviewer is flexible about the order of the
questions when the subjects are addressed and allows the respondent to develop his or her
own ideas and speak extensively about the topics. The questions are usually open as the
emphasis is on the respondent to develop their views on the topic. The whole interview process is hence very open and flexible. (Denscombe, 2017)
Unstructured interviews go even further in the aim to emphasise the respondent’s own
views and thoughts on the subject. The role of the interviewer is to introduce the theme
or the subject but interfere as little as possible during the interview. The aim of this is to
let the respondent develop his or her own ideas and pursue their own thinking, without
letting the discussion be shaped by questions the researcher already has in mind.
(Denscombe, 2017)
Like in this thesis, the mixed method mostly combines previous research and secondary
data with primary data. By using already existing data, the researcher saves both cost and
time. Secondary data also provides the opportunity for a longitudinal analysis, where
trends are identified over time. Official statistics provide opportunity for subset or
subgroup analysis (nationally representative samples) of specialized categories of
individuals. Using already existing data leaves the researcher with more time for dataanalysis. Furthermore, reanalysis may offer new interpretations of the data. Another
positive aspect of using secondary data is that the data are given more value (fuller use of
the data). Some negative aspects of using secondary data are the lack of familiarity with
the data, the complexity of the data, the lack of control of the quality of the data, and the
absence of key variables. (Bryman & Bell, 2013)

5.3 Interviews and choice of informants

The interviews were conducted in two different phases: the first interviews were
conducted 8 of March 2018 in Panaca, Quimbaya, Colombia, and the second part of the
interviews remotely during the months of April – July 2020. The informants participated
voluntarily and out of their own interest.
38

Emma Saarela
The informants that took part in the interviews conducted in the field (Panaca, Colombia)
the 8th of March, were, now former, vice president Óscar Naranjo, former guerrilla leader
Pastor Alape, members of the ARN and former ex-combatants, consisting of altogether
six people. The informants have all been directly affected by the conflict or/and are in
some way personally involved in the implementation of the peace agreements, as former
combatants, or directly representing the process as state authority.
The first interviews in 2018, were conducted by the author accompanied by three other
students attending the University of Javeriana, Bogotá, Colombia, in cooperation with the
newspapers Semana Rural and Directo Bogotá. All participants were flown by the state,
military plane, and helicopter, to Panaca, Armenia, Colombia where the graduation
ceremony took place. The fieldtrip was conducted with aim to report on the graduation of
former FARC combatants that graduated in agriculture as a part of the reincorporation
efforts of the peace accords, for the newspapers Semana Rural and Directo Bogotá.
Hence, the interviews were mainly focused on the ex-combatants’ past experiences and
their expectations for the future. Former Vice President Óscar Naranjo was asked about
the government’s efforts regarding the implementation of the peace process with the focus
on reintegration of the ex-combatants. These interviews deepen the understanding of the
conflict and its effects on the people that have lived it first-hand, and present information
building a broader perspective on different perceptions of the peace process in Colombia.
The interviews were conducted in the field and first-hand.
The first interviews are presented in the case description (chapter 6), as they are
representing people directly affected by the conflict5 and the societal implications of fake
news in the peace process.
In the second part of the interview-process, nine (9) experts in their field of work
participated. The experts are numbered as Informant X (1-9). These informants were
chosen due to their expertise in their field, as professors, journalist, photojournalists,
public administrators, and lawyers (Table 3). In the second part of the interviews the
informants were chosen to provide a personal perception on how they have experienced
the peace process and the impact and consequences of political marketing and fake news.
They were chosen from different professional fields to give a broader variety of
5

The author understands that every Colombian is affected by the conflict. However, ex-combatants are
directly affected, and are amongst the most vulnerable part of the population.

experiences and insights. The informants are all continuously working in their field of
expertise.
The informant’s occupations and areas of focus, that took part in the second phase of the
interviews, are presented in the following table.

Only two of the informants requested to stay anonymous, but due to the current situation
in Colombia the author of this thesis has chosen to not disclose the names of the
informants in the first or the second round of interviews.

5.4 Interview guide- and process

The first interviews conducted in 2018, were unstructured, in respect to the assigned
work, and to give the respondents the complete freedom to express their perceptions,
experiences and feelings in that moment of time.
For the second part of the interviews, conducted between May and June 2020, an
interview-guide was constructed (see appendix 1) to gather useful and valuable
information to support the aim, themes, and the research questions of the thesis. The
interview-guide was divided into three (3) themes; (1) experiences of the peace process,
(2) fake news, and disinformation in the peace process and the perceived consequences,
41

Emma Saarela
and (3) fake news in the different phases of the peace process. The interview guide was
written in Spanish, as it is the native language of all the respondents. The interview
questions presented in this chapter are translated into English, as the publishing language
of this thesis is English.
For every interview, the researcher introduced the area of investigation and the title of the
thesis. With respect to the social constructionist approach, not wanting to interfere with
the answers, not much else was said. The questions were left open as the researcher’s aim
was to gather as much authentic information as possible.
The informants were first asked to give a brief presentation of themselves, with focus on
their expertise in the subject of the research. The question was: “Could you please tell me
about yourself? Focused on your expertise in the subject of my research. This question
gave the informants the opportunity to introduce themselves in relation to the area of the
investigation, as they wished to be perceived, which would also help them to answer the
following questions.
The next question that the informants were asked was: “In relation to the peace process,
could you give me, in your own words, an overview of the peace process as how you have
experienced it?” The aim of this question was to get a general picture of how the
informants have, and still are, experiencing the peace process in Colombia and to map
potential patterns and exceptions in relation to the area of the investigation.
The first theme that was discussed was perceptions of the factors that have affected the
peace process in a negative or/and positive manner. This was an essential theme to cover
regarding the object of this thesis. The aim was to map perceptions on political marketing
and fake news, without directly asking for it. The third (3) question was: “What factors
have affected the peace process (in a positive or/and negative manner)?”
The second theme that was brought up was the impact of fake news and misinformation
in the peace process. Hence, the fourth (4) question was: “How much has fake news and
misinformation affected the peace process? What effects have they generated?” The aim
was to map the informant’s perceptions on how fake news and misinformation has
affected the peace process and their perceptions of the possible consequences of the
phenomenon.
42

Emma Saarela
The informants were also asked how much fake news and misinformation has affected
different phases of the peace process in Colombia. The aim was to receive an even broader
insight of perceptions of how fake news and disinformation, in form of political
marketing, has affected the peace process through the phases of the peace process, from
a social constructionism perspective.
The fifth (5) question was (that was divided into four parts: a, b, c, and d):
“How much have fake news and disinformation affected the peace process in the
following phases:
(a) Initial contact between the administration of President Santos and the FARC
(b) The beginning of the conversations between the administration of President
Santos and the FARC
(c) The negotiations between the administration of President Santos and the FARC
(d) The implementation of the peace agreement between the administration of
President Santos and the FARC”

5.5 Processing and analysis of data

Qualitative must be catalogued and indexed, as this makes it easier for the researcher to
navigate in the data material and to register what data are valuable in for the research.
Regarding the qualitative data, voice recordings are transcribed and commented on.
Transcribing makes it easier to make thorough detailed searches in the data and to
compare them. For a project researcher, transcribing must be understood as a time
consuming and essential part of the interview process. In the process of transcribing the
researcher can come “close” to the data, hence, it is a very valuable process. (Denscombe,
2017) In this thesis, the interviews were also translated from their original language,
Spanish, into English.
The first step of analysing data is to code and categorize it. That means that the researcher
will transfer pieces of “raw data” to specific categories. A thorough examination of data

43

Emma Saarela
(for example interviews) makes it possible for the researcher to see correlations or if the
data bits have something in common. (Denscombe, 2017)
In this thesis abductive reasoning was chosen for the data -analysis process. According to
social constructionism, reality is not an objective truth. Abductive reasoning uses the
pragmatism perspective, according to which actions cannot be separated from past
experiences and from beliefs that have originated from those experiences. (Mantere &
Ketokivi, 2013) An abductive approach takes a pragmatic perspective that emphasises,
investigates, and evaluates purpose and ethics. (Kelder et.al., 2005) The abductive
approach therefore aligns well with the social constructionism commitment, to look for
and accommodate many different perspectives in any social setting where decisions are
being made. (Kelder et.al., 2005) Abductive reasoning is, like inductive and deductive
approaches, used to make logical interferences and build theories about the world.
Abductive reasoning seeks to identify conditions to make phenomenon less puzzling,
aiming to find “the best prediction” out of “incomplete observations”. Abductive
reasoning uses a back-and-forth engagement with the social world and literature, as an
empirical source, for theoretical ideas. Abduction implies that the researcher selects the
“best” explanation from competing explanations or interpretations of data. (Mantere &
Ketokivi, 2013)
Abduction highlights the limited ability of the researcher to think rationally
(computational reasoning) and acknowledges the importance of cognitive reasoning in
theory building. The understanding is seen as the continuous dialogue between the data
and the researcher’s preunderstandings (the hermeneutic circle). When applying the
abductive approach, the researcher remains open to the possibility of being surprised by
the data, rather than having the data confirming their preunderstandings. (Mantere &
Ketokivi, 2013) The researcher takes an iterative approach and moves between the
different segments of the research to finally find a suitable understanding of the research
problem, and finally, presenting a result (Mantere & Ketokivi, 2013). According to
Bryman and Bell (2013) this implies that the analysis has been started in an early stage
and been continuous throughout the research.

44

5.5.1

Research quality

There are some possible factors that can affect the research quality when conducting and
transcribing interviews, for example; sometimes it might be hard to understand what is
said in the recordings (due to quality of recording, slurring, incomplete sentences, and
language barriers (such as the use of slang)), furthermore, people do not always express
themselves in full sentences or/and do not always finish their conclusions. Intonation,
pronunciation, and emphasis are difficult to capture in printed text. For the reader to fully
understand, the author must sometimes edit the spoken works, and as a result it sometimes
loses some of its authenticity. (Denscombe, 2017)
As the data are analysed from a social constructionist perspective with an abductive
approach, it is important to take into account that the researcher might have certain “blind
spots” regarding the insight in the Colombian society (due to the interviewers heritage,
age, gender, ethnic origin, and native language (among other things)), and therefore, how
the respondents are understood and how the secondary data are analysed. Furthermore,
neither the quantitative data nor the interviews will provide one complete and flawless
image of reality. According to the social constructionism theory there is not one objective
truth, in other words, this thesis provides one perspective to the research issue.

5.6 Methodological limitations

A qualitative approach from a social constructionist perspective tends to be associated
with the researcher’s indirect partiality. In other words, the researcher has a limited ability
to reflect on the world from any other perspective than that of their own. It presupposes
a discussion about how honest the respondents have been in the interviews with the
researcher, who in the research context can be perceived as an “outsider”. It is also
important to discuss how well the researcher has been able to perceive, interpret and
understand what the respondents have said. (Denscombe, 2017) Social constructionism
as a research approach implies reflexivity, in other words, the awareness of the
researcher’s role in conducting research and the questioning of assumptions in the
construction of knowledge. This implies stopping to ask questions about what is
45

Emma Saarela
occurring, rather than taking matters for granted and consequently letting the questions
and the answers influence future choices. Researchers need to pay attention to their own
assumptions and biases to account for them. A central matter for social constructionism
is to question what is known and what forms of evidence are accepted as valid. According
to Littlejohn and Foss (2009) social constructionists are however more likely to ask
questions about their own activities as well as of those that they study as they focus on
the created nature of knowledge and information. (ibid.)
In this thesis there are a couple of central limitations that can be accounted for. Three of
the main limitations that are worth mentioning are:
1. All the interviews were conducted in Spanish, which is not the native language of
the author. The interviews were translated by the author into English, which might
affect the content presented in this thesis.
2. Although the author has lived in Colombia, she is not Colombian. As the author
has not lived the conflict, she can consequently not possess a thorough
understanding of the structural conditions nor the current situation in Colombia.
(However, this can contribute a relatively objective approach to the research
matter)
3. The respondent’s political views are not known by the author. However, all the
informants supported the peace process (generally not the extreme-right). Thus,
the result of a similar research would possibly differ if people opposing the peace
process would have been interviewed too.
In a case study, the case is an object of its own right, and the researcher aims to provide
an in-depth explanation of it. Case study researchers exclude possibilities to identify cases
that can be used to represent a certain class of objects. Hence, the goal of a case study
analysis is to be concrete on the uniqueness of the case and to develop a deep
understanding of its complexity (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Social constructionism
emphasises that it is not trying to eliminate any perspectives, the result of a research is
only one way to explain a phenomenon, as the result in itself is constructed, hence, it is
not defining a definite truth, only one perspective. (Gergen, 2010)

6 Case description
This chapter includes a brief insight into the Colombian society, current political climate,
and media landscape. The chapter ends with interviews conducted in March 2018 with
some former FARC-combatants and the (former) vice president of Colombia, followed by
a summary of the chapter.

6.1 The historical background of the peace process in Colombia

In the late 19th and early 20th century the Colombian state sold off large swatches of land
to private owners to pay for its debts. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) was founded in 1996 as the armed wing of the communist party, during a time
of brutal repression against any form of action considered subversive. FARC was inspired
by the Cuban revolution in the 1950s, and they demanded more rights and control over
the land. Their communist ideals were however seen as a threat by big landowners and
the state, who sent in the army to disband the agricultural commune that the FARC had
established. The FARC has said that it was after the clashes with the army the struggle
was transferred into an armed one. (BBC News, 2016)
In November 2016, the FARC, and the government of President Santos (2010-2018),
Colombia, signed a peace agreement, “ending” more than five decades of violent
conflict.
Today however, with the relatively new president Ivan Duque (elected 2018), ordained
political heir of former President Álvaro Uribe Vélez 6 , the FARC commander Ivan
Marquez (Luciano Marín) announcing “a new phase of armed struggle” (BBC News,
2019), the Duque government cutting funding to its transitional justice mechanism (JEP),
the Truth Commission and the Search Unit for Disappeared Persons early in 2019 (Gill,
2019), the killings of social leaders (rights defenders and activists) and ex-combatants

Alvara Uribe was investigated by the Supreme Court over his alleged role in war crimes committed by a
paramilitary death squads and is now under investigation for witness tampering and fraud in relation to
crimes committed during the civil war (Parkings, 2020)

47

Emma Saarela
(Via AP news vire, 2020), and Duque losing support among people (Alsema, 2019),
Colombia still faces major challenges striving to leave behind its long legacy of political
violence.
Individual participation is the essence of democracy. According to studies on Latin
Americans commitment to democracy, it was found that poor or/and rich people are
equally politically active and committed to democracy. It was stated that democracy is
the best hope poor people have for improving their life. (Krishna, 2008) However, people
are “disappearing”, and social leaders are being assassinated on a huge scale – especially
in rural areas where state presence is nearly non-existent. Officially, more than 700
activists, indigenous leaders and former FARC-combatants have been killed since 2016.
(Krygier, 2019)
In November 2019, the general public started nation-wide demonstrations against
inequality, an unjust educational system, Duque’s slow implementation of the 2016 peace
agreement (which has led to an uptick of violence against indigenous people and social
leaders), and issues related to economic reforms and corruption7. (Grattan, 2019). False
news and promises unfulfilled plays a significant role in the Colombian political climate.
One early and significant example of this is the so called “false positives”- scandal that is
centred around the extrajudicial killings of thousands of civilians. During these times, the
Army measured its success in counterinsurgency by the number of guerrilla combatants
killed. Many of the claimed guerrilla combatants that were killed, were in fact civilians
killed by the armed forces to show results. The military was dressing the victims as
guerrillas to present them as combat kills to the media during the years 1986-2002. At the
time, these civilians, often young men, were killed to gain positive publicity, and for
military to receive financial support. (The Fellowship of Reconciliation, 2014)
The Colombian peace process can be divided into five different eras/moments according
to Octavio Salcedo, professor of social sciences (Personal communication, March 2018,
[Bogotá, Colombia]):

6.1.1

Views of James Robinson on the situation in Colombia

In 2019 Daniel Pardo interviewed economist James Robinson 9 for BBC about the
ongoing continuous violent protests and the political climate in Colombia.
According to Robinson the prosperity of a country depends on the social, political, and
economic inclusion. The exclusion in Colombia has historically generated guerrillas, drug
trafficking and poverty. According to Robinson, the current violent protests in Colombia
are not surprising. After all, Colombia is a country where 5000 civilians got murdered,
reported as war combats, so the military would get raises in salary (known as the “false
positive” -scandal).
The peace process has nevertheless opened space for a different type of politics. The
presidential elections in 2018 was the first time in 60 years when a left-wing politician
like Gustavo Petro made it to the second round, and now candidates outside of the
traditional system are winning support all over the country. However, the power is held
by a government that is not interested in change and are not implementing the important
part of the peace agreement, most importantly the rural components.
According to Robinson the biggest problem in Colombia is how the politics and the state
works. The state is co-opted by elites that are very distant from the society. The elite in
Colombia are living as if they were in a first world country, being in a predominantly
poor country such as Colombia – one of the most unequal countries in the world. They
have never governed a bigger part the country and that has created a peripheral country
that stays outside the system. The society is fragmented and integrates with the State in a
very politically patronage manner which makes it very difficult to change things as the
fragmented system is deeply rooted and has been that way since the colonialism.
According to Robinson even people like Juan Manuel Santos (former President and
promoter of the peace process), never understood that this way of doing politics is
harmful. During the peace negotiations Sergio Jaramillo (peace negotiator) sat in one
wing trying to sign peace with the Marxists, and in the other wing Santos “distributed

experts on Colombia in the world.

jam” (positions, money) in the congress, to have his projects approved, not understanding
how the two (war and political patronage) are connected.
According to Robinson (Pardo, 2019) the way of doing politics created space for the
guerrillas to emerge. Not because the Colombian elite wanted the country to become the
world capital of kidnapping and drug trafficking, but because they could not control it.
They did not have control over the rural areas of the country, which allowed drug
traffickers to buy thousands of acres of land and exporting drugs to the United States,
which had severe consequences.
When asked if there are ways to change the system, Robinson said that the traditional
system has always allowed a certain level of social or political mobility, politicians who
started at the bottom made their way to high positions and power. What has traditionally
happened with these cases is that the elites co-opt these politicians, who end up adapting
to the system. According to Robinson even politicians like Petro10 are co-opted by the
traditional system and end up being functional for the existing system. Mobility can
however generate space for changes in the political culture. An historical example of that
is how the elite tried to adjust Pablo Escobar 11 to their logic for many years, and
eventually he was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as a
part of the Liberal Alternative movement.
According to Robinson the fundamental problem is that Colombia is a fragmented
country in many ways and that it is therefore hard to imagine that Colombians would
achieve consensus on what the fundamental problem is.

6.2 The media landscape in Colombia

According to Media Landscapes (Cabrera, 2020) print media, with regional and national
circulation, have traditionally been those of superior influence and credibility in
Colombia, and those that have traditionally established the information agenda. The
pioneering newspaper have historically belonged to recognized families that have had a
clear political affiliation and have been inherited by their successors. El Tiempo and El

51

Emma Saarela
Espectador, are the two oldest newspapers with the largest circulation. El Espectador,
established in 1887, was traditionally a newspaper advocating liberalism in the country.
El Tiempo, was launched in 1911 as an initiative to support the political views of the
Republicans. Many regional newspapers followed the trend, and it is commonly known
that most known newspapers have been related to families with political and economic
influence in the regions.
There has been a change in the logic of administering media companies in Colombia.
Today, many of the print media houses belong to large economic corporations.
Traditionally the media companies have been passed through inheritance within families
with clearly recognized, prestige, established political roles. Today, media companies are
considered part of the business chain (commercial outlet), hence, with interests interfering
with the professional journalistic interest of informing the audience objectively and
impartially. (Cabrera, 2020)
According to DANE (2018), 55% of the population in Colombia over the age of 12, read
printed news. The group with the highest level of education, is the one that consumes the
least printed media. Only 9.3 % of the population with a university-level education or
higher education, 25.32% of people with secondary education, and 14.27% of people with
preschool or basic primary education consume printed media. According to DANE (2018)
this could be explained by the fact that 5 of the 10 newspapers with the largest circulation
are characterised by short texts, light content, and a lot of graphic information where local
topics dominate. Furthermore, people in rural areas tend to consume radio and TV, instead
of printed media. (Cabrera, 2020)
There are some newspapers with sections focused on issues of conflict, violence, and
human rights – for example Colombia2020 (A section in El Espectador that is funded by
the European Union). The peace agreement enhanced the enormous challenge of
integrating the FARC into the information landscape of the Colombian media. The last
time the FARC attempted to form a political party (Patriotic Union, in the 1980’s) with
the members joining civil life, with the intention of participating in the political agenda,
it ended in their murder and the extermination of the movement. (Cabrera, 2020)

52

Emma Saarela
The average Colombian prefers local or/and regional information above wide national
and international information. The former is presented in most media with popular and
sensationalism focus, or in newsletters with free circulation. 10 of the most widely
circulated print media are concentrated in Bogotá. Indigenous communities and other
minorities do not have fair representation in the media. Some of the papers that cover and
represents some of these communities, are only sold in the capital of the country and are
thus not accessible to (all) minorities. People in rural areas tend to consume radio and
TV, instead of printed media. (Cabrera, 2020)
According to a study conducted by FLIP (the Foundation for Press Freedom) in 2015, 92
municipalities in eight departments that have been the epicentres of the armed conflict
have had difficulties accessing local information. In other words, at least 1,7 million
citizens have not had access to quality sources of information. (ibid.)

6.2.1

Digital media in Colombia

Despite the peace deal signed in 2016 between the FARC-guerrilla and the government
of President Santos, an alarming rate of lethal attacks have targeted activists and human
rights defenders, leading to challenges for freedom of expression. The peace process in
Colombia has been strongly affected and shaped by social media and the proliferation of
misinformation, online aggression, and fake news. The rise of ICTs and media technology
has also been significantly influential and damaging to the democratic process. (The
Freedom House, 2018)
According to a study conducted in 2017 by the Freedom House (2017), nearly 40% of
Colombians do not have access to internet, mostly due to socioeconomic factors, causing
limitations for some platforms to be reached.
WhatsApp and Facebook are favoured by Colombians between the age 14 and over 65,
according to a government survey. (Statista, 2019)

A recent study conducted by Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, showed an alarming
rate of consumption of fake news online. According to this study 70% of Latin Americans
do not know how to identify fake news online. Colombia ranked second in this region
with 73%. (Diazgranados, 2020)
According to the same study, 16% of Latin Americans do not recognize the term or
concept of fake news at all. Kaspersky also found that 1/3 of Latin Americans use social
media as their only source of information. People from the ages 18 to 24 mostly use social
media for the purpose of attaining information, whereas people between 35 and 50 mostly
use traditional media for the same purpose. In Colombia 26% use social media as their
only source of information, and 47 % of Colombians do not question what they read on
the internet. Furthermore, people between 25 and 34 are most likely to share impactful
news without verifying, whereas people between 18 and 24 are least likely to do so.

According to a study by Universidad del Rosario a homogeneity in the way people get
information on the internet cannot be ignored. In respect to the 2016 plebiscite,
Colombians select who to follow, and tend to get more involved in political discussions
with likeminded people on networks such as Twitter. An example of echo-chambers
through WhatsApp was also given during the 2016 peace agreement referendum period.
Through massive messaging chains, the belief that voting NO to the agreement would be
the best option to avoid becoming the “next Venezuela” and “protecting the family”, was
massively advertised. In a later stage, the promoters of the campaign admitted that these
had been ways to convince the population to vote NO. (Cabrera, 2020)
The presidential elections in 2018 came to be a very crucial phase of the peace agreement
– where it stood between Ivan Duque, representing the extreme right and with promises
to make big changes on the peace agreement (such as harder punishments or/and

55

Emma Saarela
sentences for former FARC combatants12), and Gustavo Petro, representing the left with
promises of faster implementation of the peace agreement. (ibid.)

FIGURE 5 MESSAGES OF VIOLENDE DURING THE ELECTORAL CONVERSATIONS IN 2018

In the Colombian presidential elections in 2018 a lot of the mentions and electoral
conversations contained a lot of messages of intolerance and polarization. These elections
came to be potentially crucial for the future progress of the implementation of the peace
accords. (The Freedom House, 2018)
Kaspersky concludes the study by stating that a big part of Latin Americans continues to
blindly trust everything they read on the internet which can have severe impact in peoples
personal lives, but also a larger impact on a wider scale. (Diazgranados, 2020)

6.3 Voices of the conflict

The following interviews were conducted in 2018 in Panaca, Armenia, Colombia. These
interviews are presented in this thesis as a representation of the consequences of the
conflict and experiences and expectations of people who have lived the very conflict
or/and represent it. These people’s statements thus give a concrete expression of what the
core of the conflict is that the country has experienced and what could pave the way for
a lasting peace. The chapter begins with an introduction to the event that the author of
this thesis attended in March 2018, followed by an interview of the now former vice
President of Colombia: Óscar Naranjo, followed by interviews with some of the former
combatants and a former commander of the FARC. 13

Introduction to the graduation of former FARC- guerrilla
8.3.2018, Panaca, Colombia

More than 300 ex-combatants, 264 men and 61 women, between the ages 18 and 75, all
former combatants, graduated as agricultural technicians, and thus, became the first group
of former FARC guerrilla to a achieve a higher education with the support of the
Colombian government. The graduation took place on March 8, in corporation with the
Foundation of the National Park of Agricultural Culture (Fundapanaca), who oversaw the
training process. The graduation was a part of the reintegration of the former combatants
as a part of the implementation of the peace agreement.

264 men, 61 women between the ages 18 and 75 that were combatants in the war, are today
a demonstration for Colombia and the whole world, that a new era is beginning, that we
are in the middle of peace. For them – a strong deserved applause! Today they are
graduating as agricultural practical technicians. The discourse of war is today transferred
into the discourse to maintain peace. To all of you, welcome! (Speaker in the beginning

Interview with Óscar Naranjo, Vice President of
Colombia (March 2017 – August 2018)

During the ceremony Óscar Naranjo stated that the government is proud of seeing how
more than 300 men and women, who until recently were armed, today have a diploma
that accredits them to return to the field and transform it.
The country no longer endures more violence. (Óscar Naranjo)

PICTURE 8 OSCÁR NARANJO SPEAKING AT THE CEREMONY

(Former) Vice president Óscar Naranjo explained that Colombia is moving forward in a
process of building peace in Colombia.
Peace is built, for example today, witnessing more than three hundred men and women that
have come to Panaca, who in the past had taken up arms, but today act in peace. For three
months they have been enabled, have been trained to become competitive peasants to
transform the territory. But beyond that, we are witnessing a process that opens pathways to
reconciliation and encounter between all Colombians. What has happened here in Panaca is
that Colombians have rediscovered that there is a population that has to be welcomed by us,
so that it returns to the territory to build a social fabric, to produce, and particularly, to have a
project of life, free from violence, and far from death. (Vice president Óscar Naranjo)

59

Emma Saarela
According the delays in the reincorporation of the ex-combatants, that have been
denounced, even by the FARC, Oscar Naranjo commented:
What the government estimates is that we must accelerate the reincorporation processes.
This process that is being carried out here today already speaks of concrete results, and
now we can get down to work. The debate around peace and peacebuilding shall not be a
theoretical debate or a political debate, but a debate formed around realities of
transformation. We know that much remains to be done, but we are on the right path. And
the best thing is that you and the country will be able to verify is the testimony of men and
women who, after this process, feel that there is a future, feel that there is hope, and have
faith that Colombians, all of us, include ourselves in the transformation of the country and
the building of peace.

PICTURE 9 OSCÁR NARANJO GREETING THE POLICE FORCES

Òscar Naranjo was asked how long the government will add budget to conduct programs
like the one in Panaca, and the following was his answer:
The government is reviewing how to ensure political, social, and economic reincorporation
for ex-FARC combatants. But beyond that, I must point out, that this is a project that must
include communities, this is not a process simply and exclusively for ex-FARC combatants.
This is a process of reparation for the transformation of territory, which, in our opinion, must
include community leaders, it must include Colombia’s peasants, it must include excombatants, and it must also include former members of the security forces who, now
returning to their fields, must prepare for this transformation.

Interviews with former FARC-combatants

During one of the interviews with a former combatant, he explained how he ended up
joining the FARC:
What happened to me was that I was a police officer, and they threw me out on the street
because I did a favour for a police officer, a commander of mine.

He said that, because of that favour, they linked him to something that he was not
responsible of. He claimed he was not guilty of anything, but they did not listen.
They do not wait for you to explain yourself or give you the benefit of the doubt to
understand you.

He got a call from FARC to join their forces, and in desperation, not knowing what else
to do, he did. He ended up working with commander Óscar on the front of Teófilo Forero
for 12 years. He said he paid a high price with suffer and depression for having changed
the pace of his life like that. He was later arrested and served 10 years in prison for several
crimes; terrorism, extortion, and other crimes that he, according to himself, did not
commit. In prison he learned how to make sculptures, and later shared his art with his
fellow students and teachers in Panaca. In Panaca he followed through with all the classes
and learned how to write and read.
Now, 74 years old, I graduated in agriculture. It is a new opportunity. I am very excited.

by improving the capabilities of the people.
Another former combatant said that she sees a very bright future thanks to the preparation
they had in Panaca. She said that the hope is the same as during the 53 years of fight for

In one way or another we must do it, and this is where we start. We want to go where the
government has not been, the places that have been abandoned for centuries, and tell our
brothers and sisters that one must move forward. I think it is very important for all of us that
we have accomplished this process. (Former female FARC-combatant)

She said that the goal is to build a new Colombia, without war, so that young people no
longer must train for war. She said that the objective is to consolidate collective gardens
and the production of minor species, because if there is no work in the region, there will
be no peace.

She also said that they are setting an example. The FARC are social transformers, and it
is a right that corresponds to them, the former guerrilla, to teach the people that the
Colombian state have not managed to do. Therefore, the Colombians state and all entities
that are included in this process, have to offer them the guarantee of education, for them
to address the people, since the state has not previously succeeded in doing so.
She stated that now, during the reintegration process, there has been a lot of support from
the state.
There has been a dialogue, and well, here we are, hand in hand, as brothers and sisters, so far,
right? We continue hoping for more, that they fulfil their promises. The first thing we all do
with these new learnings is that we demand, in order to apply what we have learned in the
field, that they give land to us ex-combatants and to the people of the rural areas.

Right now, we are going back to our territories hoping that the Government is going to support
us in moving forward. We are people who have nothing but life and the desire to work. Thus,
the next step is to wait for land, because right now we do not have it, we cannot buy it, and
we do not have a place to work.

6.4 Summary of the case description

According to Óscar Palma (Interviewed by Worley, 2018), messages of intolerance and
violence can be viewed as particularly problematic in the Colombian context, where
political violence has been a powerful force for a long time. The country has suffered a
civil war for many decades, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people and
the displacement of millions.
Despite of the ongoing peace process, social activists and former combatants are
continuously murdered. Some doubt the link between violence online and violence in real
life. Others believe that there is a direct link between Fake News and violence, believing
that narratives of hate, that are amplified by social media, increase viciousness. According
to Palma (Worley, 2018), there is a discourse that is pronounced by political leaders that
leads to social leaders being killed and former FARC members being harassed. According
to Palma (Worley, 2018) one reaction to such discourse could be the decision to vote a
specific way, but at the extreme it could result in murder. This phenomenon creates a
deep effect in the areas of conflict where there are former combatants and civilians in the
same place.

7 Presentation of data

In this chapter the data gathered during the interviews with the Colombian informants
(presented in chapter 5.3, table 3 & 4), is presented. How the interviews were planned
and carried out is described in detail in Chapter 5.4. Data are presented with an
abductive reasoning, which means that the researcher has reproduced the most
representative statements in the interview material. The main themes the respondents give
their views on are the peace process in general (Chapter 7.1), the role that marketing of
political agendas (7.2) and especially fake news (7.2.1) has had, and the social
consequences of fake news in Colombia (7.4).

7.1 Perceptions of the peace process in Colombia

Informant 8 summarized the peace process that was put froward by talks between the
government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC as a national need that had been
brewing many years, not only the conflict in itself, but also the permanence of existing
critical problems in the country, such as inequality.
The peace process is an opportunity for Colombia to achieve an advancement that it has
not been able to experience due to the armed conflict. (Informant 9)

Informant 3 started by pointing out that the initiating decision of President Pastrana
(1980’s) to present a proposition15 of a peace agreement on a negotiation basis, was a
very positive factor. A view shared by many of the informants was that another positive
factor was that once the negotiations that started under the Santos regime, they involved
of various actors, among them the catholic church. Informant 3 also pointed out that the
peace process has been supported by various foreign governments, sectors of the civil
society, and various social organizations.

66

Emma Saarela
Informant 7 described the final peace agreement as an representation of an advancement
in the country, as it attempts to account for some critical issues in the Colombian history
that have been considered to be the roots of the very conflict; primarily that land
ownership has been concentrated in the hands of a few, and the closed political regime
that has not allowed the participation of alternative political forces. Informant 4 noted that
Colombia is now in the implementation stage of the peace process – in the stage of which
the government is to implement the different points of the agreements.
Informant 4 said that the peace process is progressing, but it has had its main “Achilles
heel” in the political participation of the victims. Many of the informants agreed that that
even if the negotiations included participations of the victims of the conflict and the
society in general, the victims were not a central actor, and this, consequently, weakened
the agreement.
I have had conversations with victims where they told me that they felt relegated and that
their proposals ended up as small annexes. To limit the negotiations to the government and
one single guerrilla left out millions of victims and other illegal armed groups, it left gaps
in the implementation, and thus means that the conflict continues. (Informant, 7)

According to many of the informants, the active political participation of the victims in
the Colombian political system is the most important element of the implementation.
However, this element of the implementation stage has not yet been complied. The
process has made some progress when it comes to certain issues raised in the peace
agreement in terms of reparation, justice, and non-repetition. But it is also a process that
has, in political terms, been quite truncated.
Something that has to be kept in mind when trying to understand the peace process in a
way where the victims are understood as the central axis, is that even if they have received
some state response, they have not managed to become full political actors in the
Colombian political system. (Informant 4)

The incorporation of armed groups into civilian life has brought some successful political
representations in government bodies, recognition of territories and generation of
alternative production, but also tragic situations, such as the murder of reintegrated
people, intimidation of leaders and delays in land law. (Informant 6)
Personally, due to my political convictions, my origin - I was born and lived in Cali -, and
my work as a university professor, this passing has moved between the hope for a truly
inclusive Colombia that redistributes better, and the capsizing of the fatal destiny of those
who have dared to report an work to make those changes. (Informant 6)

67

Emma Saarela
Informant 4 stated that a positive element regarding the peace agreement is that is has
been viewed positively in many countries in the international community. It is understood
that moving forward in the implementation of the peace agreement is a fundamental
element for Colombia to advance in terms of developing processes of peaceful dynamics
for elimination of the different forms of conflict. According to Informant 4, another
positive element is that it has been possible to advance a lot, excluding the element of
victim participation, in some important implementation processes – such as the special
jurisdiction for peace and the mechanism for restitution. According to the informants, a
positive aspect of the political communication is that people in the cities are now
generally more aware of the conflict that for many years hit the rural areas.
Many of the informants agreed that Colombia has been relatively successful in deweaponizing many armed organizations, but not in dealing with the communities,
populations, and territories from where the armed groups have come. Informant 5 stated
that, the peace process is more about the abandonment of arms of the oldest group raised
in arms and only secondly about a peace process. According to informant 5, simply put,
it is a contract signed with President Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2018), that should be
implemented by the succeeding governments. However, the implementation has
encountered numerous obstacles in relation to the implementation, on the part of the
current president Iván Duque Márquez. According to informant 1, it is obvious that the
current government (Duque, 2018 -) have not had the will to implement the peace accords,
because they never agreed to them in the first place.
They are continuing the killing of community leaders; the aid does not reach the
demobilized and not the people that were amid the conflict. Drug trafficking has increased
and this it is how illegal groups continue to finance themselves. Therefore, I am pessimistic
about if they will ever be implemented. This can recur all over again and turn into a new
war in Colombia. (Informant 1)

Informant 2 stated that structural reforms for socially, economically and politically
marginalized communities have never been in the interest of the state, nor have they been
developed by institutions that have dedicated themselves to providing assistance-based
responses to both guerrillas and paramilitaries who have laid down their arms and to the
communities where these organizations were present. After the withdrawal of the armed
organizations, these communities, populations, and territories, have been exposed and left
even more vulnerable than before. The state never arrived in these areas. The peasants
have been forced to plant coca bushes, because the coca leaf is the only thing that has
68

Emma Saarela
commercial outlet in these areas where there is no infrastructure (access only by trail) and
where there are no schools nor healthcare.
Additionally, to slow down and/or end the “peace process”, systematic assassinations of
social leaders are taking place and some members of the dome of the former FARC are
returning to the field of belligerence - insurgent warfare - to form the new FARC. In
conclusion, the process is being bogged down in the current government 2019-2023.
(Informant 5)

Another shortcoming was that the FARC was considered a homogenous group. This fact
led to some of the members choosing to return to arms, as they did not feel considered in
the peace agreement. Furthermore, many of the ex-combatants that did believe in peace,
still returned to arms, as many of the promises that were given to the ex-combatants, were
not fulfilled.
In conversations with former combatants in ETCR 16 I have heard a constant
disappointment in the actions of the State regarding its guarantees. It should be added that
this disappointment has increased with the increase in murders of ex-combatants in recent
years. (Informant 7)

Informant 2 also pointed out that the implementation passes through the congress of the
republic, where the representants opposing the peace agreement have been further
strengthened. They made sure all the agreements had to pass through this instance, and
consequently, the votes of political parties in favour of the implementation do not add up
to approve the necessary reforms.
These sectors have successfully militarized the processes of disarming men and women
of the left and right. The democratic changes that have been suggested and considered,
are developed in a very limited and controlled way, and as the guerrilla and paramilitary
organizations have already laid down their arms, they have absolutely no capacity to
demand compliance.
Informant 6 describes the peace process as a “long and painful handover of the country”
since the signing of the first agreements in the late 1980’s.
With the change of government, the implementation of the agreements that were achieved,
were weakened. And somehow, the momentum brought by the results of the peace
negotiations, and, above all, the social and political motivation to accompany the process,
slowed down in a sense. (Informant 8)

7.2 Perceptions of the political communication in the different
phases of the peace process in Colombia

To understand the perceptions that the Colombian informants have of the peace process
and the impacts of fake news, more specifically, the impact of marketing methods when
applied in an unethical way within the political spectrum, it is important to understand
how the informants comprehend the political communication in Colombia in general. The
informants freely provided an account on, based on the questions presented in the
interview guide, their own views on several events, and the role of the media, and how
information dissemination - or the lack of it - have affected the developments in the
country when working towards a peaceful solution to the conflict and the establishment
of a peaceful and democratically civil society.
According to Informant 2, the international community surrounded the government in
power, led by President Santos, to advance the negotiations. Four foreign governments
(Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, and Norway) offered to accompany Colombia in the peace
efforts. The peace negotiations were carried out in Havana, Cuba. The peace negotiations
begun with a strong opposition, as the fear of the country being handed over to the FARC
was spread through the country.
According to informant 7, the negotiations were set to take place outside Colombia, to
guarantee the protection of the process. The idea was to protect the dialogues from
external spoilers and misrepresentations. However, specifically because of the silence,
rumours about topics of what was discussed in Havana, started to hover around. This
generated fear in a part of the population. Therefore, a part of the agreement was disclosed
that year to clarify some of the points that were being discussed and deny some of the
false messages that were circulating. However, fake news reoccurred - for example, that
the agreement would imply immunity for the FARC combatants and that they would
receive money.
If we locate ourselves at the beginning of the peace process, when it was already public
knowledge, there was considerable disbelief since the extreme right, led by the central
democratic party, was in charge of undermining the credibility of the dialogues that were
being carried out in Havana, Cuba, among the Colombian population. The democratic
centre claimed that the guerrilla was a gang of drug traffickers and assassins who had no
intention of leaving the business, much less the drug trafficking routes. Additionally, they

70

Emma Saarela
reaffirmed that the FARC secretariat had already started several peace processes and left
them laying (they withdrew) and used them to grow their ranks. (Informant 5)

Informant 4 highlighted that comments and disinformation attacking the peace process
was seen already during the negotiations. According to the informants, the secrecy with
which the administration conducted the peace negotiations and the lack of information
about the process during the creations, created a great deal of mistrust towards the peace
negotiations, something that was constantly used by opponents to misinform.
The informants all mentioned that a narrative was created that FARC obtained many
benefits that they did not deserve, among these immunity, and that the Santos government
allied with the FARC to “take revenge” against the so-called “good citizens” – according
to informant 2 - basically people representing the sectors that have controlled the official
narrative historically. According to the informants expressions were established such as
that the government was “selling the country to the FARC” and “allowing the FARC to
take control of the country, the politics and/or the government”. Most of the informants
mentioned that the biggest fake news moving around during the period of negotiations
was that there would be a guarantee of immunity for the FARC combatants and other
paramilitary. In other words, that the members of FARC would not face any type of
punishment or administrational justice for the crimes that were committed.
That the members of FARC would not face any type of punishment or administrational
justice is false because that is why SJP [The Special Jurisdiction for Peace] exist , the SJP
is a product of the peace agreement and it is built upon a special normative framework that
is in charge of applying justice. But yes, that was one of the main fake news that was
moving around. (Informant 4)

Informants mentioned that they felt that false claims had a great impact on the public
opinion and that it generated- using then listing of informant 4 - a strong polarization,
creating fractionation around how the public understood the peace agreement.
The process has been affected by fake news in a negative way, not allowing the
demonstration of the importance of the process. (Informant 9)

It was explained by the informants, that in this phase, when the Santos government
presented the peace agreement to be endorsed by the Colombian population, as the
agreements had been approved in Havana, Cuba, and signed at the Colon theatre in
Bogotá (between the members representing the Colombian State and the Colombian
President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC-EP negotiators and Rodrigo Londoño
Echeverri, “Timochenko”), that a great wave of disinformation was generated.
71

Emma Saarela
It is to be highlighted that the design of the fake news was so thorough that some indicate
that the extreme right used “Cambridge Analytica”-type strategies in the same way as
during the elections of Donald Trump. (Informant 5)

The result of the voting on the peace agreement was in favour of the extreme right with a
very small margin (51%). 17 This, according to many of the informants, increased,
deepened, and polarized the divergency between the ones that agreed with the peace
process and those who did not agree with what was signed in Havana even further.
Informant 5 listed some false narratives that were designed by the Democratic Centre (the
extreme right) residual groups of paramilitaries (The Gulf Clan, Black Eagles):
1.

The handover of the government of Juan Manuel Santos from the Colombian state
to the criminal gang of the FARC-EP.

2.

A transformation of the State of Colombia into a socialist country in the style of
Venezuela.

3.

Absolute forgiveness to the members of FARC-EP and they therefor would not
have to answer for the crimes against humanity that they committed.

4.

Ending private property ownership, especially expropriating the owners of large
tracts of land (landowners).

5.

The management of the military forces would be given to the hands of the FARCEP.

According to informant 1, Alvaro Uribe and other members of the democratic centre
possess so much hate, and therefore misinformed and torpedoed the peace agreement by
creating anxiety and capsize in Colombian voters.
The informants described the current situation (2020) as a stage of implementation. The
informants mentioned that a lot of components of the agreement have not yet been
implemented with validity, in a real and effective way, such as the political participation
of the victims. And in the stage of the implementation, there is a larger variety of fake
news, positions, strategies, mechanisms in networks, and fake profiles of people with
public visibility. Informant 4 says that one of the main focuses now, during the
implementation stage, is the PDETs (territorially focused development plans), as excombatants need territorial spaces for civil presence. One of the biggest false narratives

17

Later realized without the popular vote.

72

Emma Saarela
that has been circulating is that the ex-combatants would take advantage of this space to
grow more cocaine to extort money for terrorist actions, among other things.
In Colombia we have evidence of recidivism of some former FARC members, that is a
fact. And they have taken part in illegal actions, that is true, but what the right extreme
forces have done is to point out some cases and generalised it to sound like something that
is happening with all ex-combatants. (Informant 4)

Informant 2 describes the implantation of the peace accords as being “sold” as containing
too many concessions to the FARC and stated that the peace agreement has been
discredited by creating fear in the Colombian society. The informant all mentioned how
the most vulnerable part of the population has not been given the aid that they have been
promised and how they still to this day are unable to practice their democratic rights.
Some of the informants mentioned that the seats in congress that were created for
peasants, indigenous people, and black communities – that have never been able to
represent their interest - were presented as seats for predators and seats to benefit only the
communities that are inhabited by ex-combatants of the FARC-EP, even if FARC already
had representation in congress.
It was pointed out how a vulnerable situation is used by political figures to propagate their
propaganda. The opponents took advantage to discredit the agreements. The
administration of President Santos had very little time to implement the agreements18, and
the Duque government has stopped the process.
This administration wants to show the very few advancements in the peace process and
what have been implemented as great achievements, but these have been insufficient.
(Informant 1)

The informants pointed out that the peace process contemplated that the profound causes
of why the Colombian society has remained in conflict for so long have to be revised.
According to informant 2 however this review is not in the interest of certain sectors since
they would not benefit from it. For these sectors, the version according to which the
FARC are the cause of everything bad in Colombia, and now the drug trafficking, is a
satisfactory explanation, which they have also undertaken against the transitional justice
system and its institutions.
The groups in power that opened up for the opportunity to democratize the Colombian
society lost the referendum and the elections, partly out of clumsiness, and partly because
they were not able to create a different narrative than the idea of that as the country we are,
18

The agreement was signed in November 2016, and Santos left the presidency in August, 2018.

73

Emma Saarela
we are doing well. And this has made it a lot more difficult to implement the different
peace agreements, which was already very difficult to achieve. (Informant 2)

According to informant 2, the sectors that have governed the Colombian society and state
since colonial times (1810 and onward), are owners of the media, occupy the Presidency,
and the seats in congress. They are senior state officials and rule the directives of the
political parties. Informant 5 says that it is necessary to contextualize that historically,
during the last 70 years, Colombia has been subjected to a systematic handling of
information according to the groups of power and interest in the conduct of the State. In
other words, manipulation has not only been happening during the initial contacts of the
peace process up to the current stage of the process – Colombia has always been
manipulated with disinformation.
Informant 6, describes the phenomenon of fake news in Colombia in the recent years as
the transfer of confrontation between the political right - that has governed with all its
economic and political apparatus - and anyone who does not agree with their actions or
forms. Fake news has been accepted in alternative communication channels, such as
communal councils and social networks. The literate left has tried challenging them, but
with less economic and political power. Informant 6 describes it as an unequal fight that
has led to negative results of the referendum for peace and to the recent election of the
president going under the scheme “Colombia cannot end up like Venezuela.”
The scaremongering regarding Colombia ending up like Venezuela, was repeated
continuously by the respondents.
Informant 4 also stated that another factor that has greatly affected the credibility of the
peace agreement, is the choice of offenders, such as Ivan Marquez and Jesus Santrich
who were members and very important leaders in the FARC, to leave SJP (the Special
Jurisdiction for Peace) and return to arms or/and leave the country.
No peace agreement, and nobody is going to pretend that all ex-combatants agree with the
peace agreement, but let us say that in the Colombian case, the departure of these people
has been very, very, crucial. (Informant 4)
Another moment of fake news was the claim that because Iván Márquez, Jesús Santrich,
alias “el paisa”, left to form the new FARC-EP, the process is a total failure since a large
part of the ex-guerrillas returned to the insurgency. (Informant 5)

Many of the informants stated that political and media mismanagement overshadowed
the relevance of the agreement. From the moment that the peace process was made public,
74

Emma Saarela
there was a lack of pedagogy for the ordinary citizen and the communities in general to
prepare the setting for the plebiscite – which could and should have been managed in a
much more positive way: pro-victim and pro-peace. According to informant 8, political
and media mismanagement overshadowed the relevance of the agreement, the history,
and what the peace agreement could represent for the country’s dynamics. This applies
especially to the future communities where the FARC has had power and historical
presence.
The zone, the territory of the war, could not give its voice and be the protagonist in the
absence of a more successful handling of the communication and, on the contrary, regions
that have been little affected - were the voices for the attainments of opposing the peace
agreement. The government lacked assertiveness to manage and communicate the
achievements and benefits of the agreement and lost the opportunity in the presentation of
the news. (Informant 8)

7.2.1

Perceptions of the communication of fake news during the
peace process

It was generally noted by the informants that the arguments to vote NO for the peace
referendum (in 2016) that spread on social networks were created with a mix of fake
news. These messages went viral and included topics related to the peace process such as
the question regarding justice, and the processes of political participation of the FARC that then lingered in the minds of the readers who believed in the fake news. Informant 3
stated that at the time many believed that the government would be offering the guerrillas,
once demobilized, a monthly salary of 1,600,00019 pesos.” According to informant 5,
another effect of the fake news was the nonconformity that the members of the FARCEP, would not pay one day in jail despite their human rights violations, which took root
in a large part of all the social strata’s20. These where the interactions of the users of the
Hashtags (#) #SíALaPaz #QuieroLaPazVotoNO.21”
There was talk about a pen that could be erased with the use of a light bulb. In the news it
was stated that the NO- votes were going to be erased, so it ended up inviting voters to
bring their own ballpoint pen. It was also said that Timoshenko would be the next president,

Emma Saarela
that Colombia would fall into the hands of “Castrochavismo”22 and that the pensioners’
money were going to be reduced as it would be used to finance ex-combatants in their
reintegration process. (Informant 7)

Some of the informants mentioned the tweets of former President Alvaro Uribe, who
repeatedly chose to communicate to his followers that if the YES vote 23 (for the
referendum) won, it would mean that the government would surrender to a group of
terrorists as the country was going to be handed over to FARC.
Informants stated that consequently, due to the fake news campaigns, when the time came
for the Colombian people to vote about what was negotiated in Havana, people were so
misinformed and had such a high level of mistrust, that they took the streets to vote NO
to the referendum that would approve the agreement between the Government of Juan
Manuel Santos and FARC.
The informants mentioned that a lot of fake news was moving through WhatsApp and
Facebook and has ended up increasing the polarization in the Colombian society.
Informant 4 stated that the fact that the vote of the referendum resulted in 51 percent
voting against, and 49 percent voting in favour, indicates the high level of political
polarization. However, as the voting took place several years ago, fake news had not
reached its’ real peak yet - there were no WhatsApp- bots and scammers, for example,
false pages and profiles did not exist in the same manner as today. In other words, the
fake news issue did have an impact initially at the negotiating tables, when they were
installed, but not as strong of an impact as it came to have in later stages. The political
polarization has given rise to certain parties, leaders and other political forces that are
taking advantage of this polarization to attack the peace agreement. According to
informant 4, the political polarization is what has affected the implementation of the peace
agreement the most.
Informants highlighted the fact that, now in the present implementation stage, the use of
social networks is becoming established and available for all. Today, fake news has a
wide range of ways to travel. There are scammers on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,

22

A term invented by Àlvaro Uribe Velez and the Democratic Centre to refer to a left-wing political
ideology, created and perfected in Venezuela and Cuba, that could enter Colombia through the peace
agreement between President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC and, consequently, end democracy in
Colombia as the FARC would step into power.
23
For the referendum

76

Emma Saarela
WhatsApp, among others - basically on all social networks. There are people that are
dedicated to creating fake news, twenty-four hours a day, moving them around from false
profiles, but also from institutional profiles. Informant 4 says that today Colombia sees a
strong impact of that. There is a great movement of fake news around the implementation
process.
Whenever there is some news related to the implementation and there is some participation
of some provincial political party, or the former leaders of FARC, and if there is a policy
to be implemented, or there is some movement on the part of the victims to generate some
process of reincorporation – they are automatically attacked with all these scammers, all
these false profiles, and they begin to distract with numerous amounts of news - an
incalculable amount. In Colombia it is impossible to count the amount of fake news that
circulate. (Informant 4)

According to Informant 4 Colombia is one of the countries in Latin America where the
topic of fake news has been most strongly present. Fake news in Colombia related to the
peace agreement has mainly been from two positions: the primary position is the
ideological spectrum of the extreme right that has promoted the idea that a peace
agreement would imply giving the FARC too many, undeserved, benefits and no
consequences. Informant 4 stated that fake news from this political spectrum succeeded
in promoting the idea that the peace agreement was a mistake, and that all it did was to
provide economic resources and political power to the ex-combatants and, forgiving
them, and fundamentally allowing them great influence in Colombian politics without
there being any kind of consequences for their earlier actions.
According to informant 4, there has also been a lot of fake news circulating that was
created by the extreme left. Mainly that all the decisions that have been made by the
current government (right-wing government) are completely opposing the peace
agreement.
In conclusion, fake news from the right are always discrediting the deal and from the left
they are always looking at all the government decision through a lens of total criticism.
The current government has clearly made mistakes in the implementation of the peace
agreement, but on the other hand, any type of political decision that has been enforced by
the government is seen as a totally negative element by the left extreme. (Informant 4)

An important component, mentioned by most of the informants, for the peace agreement
to be successfully implemented, is gaining the trust of the general population, who is to
“live the agreement”. Informant 5 stated that fake news has increased mistrust in the
Colombian people, especially in the upper social classes, making people believe that
private property and the free-market economic model, of which they are front-line
77

Emma Saarela
protagonists, is at stake, in combination with fake news suggesting former FARC-EP
combatants would avoid punishment for any earlier committed acts of violence and crime.
According to informant 4, the last presidential elections, although it is not directly
connected to the peace process, but related to it, had significant consequences due to the
circulation of fake news. During the elections fake news had a very high production and
circulation on social media in Colombia and ended up greatly affecting the intention of
many of the Colombians’ vote. The idea that moved around the elections was that if
Gustavo Petro (left-wing politician), who was Ivan Duque’s opponent, won, he would
hand the country to FARC, and finally Colombia would end up like Venezuela, in other
words, with a dictatorial regime, a hyper-deep economic crisis, among other things. This
idea circulated extensively. Although this idea was connected to the elections, it has also
always been highly connected with the results of the peace agreement. (Informant 4)
After more than 50 years of war and an absurd fight of political and economic powers, one
could have thought that it would end in a peace agreement signed in Cartagena. The arrival
of the new government [in 2018], based on the thought that the country was handed to the
FARC – as it created uncertainty in half of the people in Colombia and they elected a
President like Iván Duque - due to fear that a guy from the left such as Gustavo Petro would
win. It was the interests of a political party that is full of hate for the left and for the FARC
that won the elections. This has been a negative factor for the implementation of the peace
accords. (Informant 1)

Informant 3 highlighted that in 2020 former President Santos admitted that fake news had
a great impact in misrepresenting what the peace agreement really meant and that he had
underestimated the power of social networks and fake news.

7.3 Perceptions on the societal implications of fake news used as a
political marketing tool in Colombia

According to informant 5 the democratic centre party has, since the beginning of the peace
process, until this day, deepened the hatred, anger and disbelief in the peace process in
the Colombian population with the creation and spreading of fake news on social
networks and in the representative mass media.
As informants stated, fake news began to circulate even before the referendum, which
(further) polarized the views of the population. According to informant 7, the
78

Emma Saarela
misrepresentation of gender focus (status of people representing minorities) decisions
began to circulate around the agreement, that motivated some religious variants to NOT
support the plebiscite. (Informant 7)
Informant 6 stated that Fake news has functioned as a justification for evading the
implementation of what was agreed and have allowed attention to divert to invented
situations.
Fake news has resulted in all parties losing motivation for the agreement and its
achievements losing credibility and social and political support. (Informant 8)

Informant 2 mentioned that the peace processes have always depended on sectors of the
national and international civil society, that believe in negotiated solutions rather than in
armed confrontations. They have also counted on marginalized communities and
territories that have had hope that these processes might bring some sort of opportunities,
progress, and presence of the state to these regions. However, currently, since November
2016 (the signing of the peace agreement) nearly 200 ex-combatants have been
assassinated (March 2020).
Informant 5 states that the territories that were left by the former FARC guerrilla, are now
occupied with other guerrilla groups (ELN and EPL), and groups dedicated to drug
trafficking and the exploitation of illegal mining and new fractions of the paramilitaries.
The effects that we are experiencing now are the murders of community leaders are
continuing and now exceed 500, more than 200 of them being former members of FARC
that demobilized, the drug trafficking have increased. etc. (Informant 1)

Informant 2 stated that many of the women and men that she has interviewed, have
expressed that they felt safer during the war than the “peace.”
According to informant 7 it has been asserted that the deaths of social leaders have not
been due to the leadership tasks they have been carrying out in the face of the
implementations of the peace agreement (land restitution, crop substitution etc.), but are
due to other factors, such as problems with short skirts and boundaries.
According to informant 5, the governing coalition in congress that has been opposing the
approval of laws that allow the consolidation of the peace process, such as the new seats
in the senate and the chamber that represent the victims of the conflict, has tried, on

79

Emma Saarela
several occasions, to overturn or modify some of the laws that represent the peace process
at its core and that have already been approved – such as the SJP.
Another very negative aspect was the departure of congressmen from the FARC party 24,
and former members of the general secretariat of the former FARC- EP25, Henrán Darío
Velásquez, Alias el Paisa, who formed new fronts of insurgents “The new FARC”
(Informant 5)

According to many of the informants, the main problem at this stage is disinformation.
Disinformation has been the main problem that the agreement and its implementation has
faced, the most evident point of which was the result of the “No” in the referendum.
(Informant 8)

According to informants the actual reporting of how the implementation is going, has not
been managed. The fake news about how much is progressing, is the official version.
It is the reality. The supposed efforts, which are imperceptible and non-existent, are the
official voices of how the agreement is going in its implementation, as national and
international actors’ rains in its regard, leading to a possible failed peace process in
Colombia. (Informant 8)

Informant 2 stated that the disinformation surrounding the peace process has generated
the withdrawal of interest and support for the FARC’s laying down of arms, as an historic
opportunity to deepen democracy in the country. As of today, the country has not
understood the deep causes that led to FARC arming itself, nor is it interested in
understanding them. Culturally, there is an amnesia and indifference for the daily deaths
of social leaders and ex-combatants, which are alarming.
The assassinations are a lot more alarming than what Covid-19 may be causing, and these
deaths have not stopped even in this time of pandemic. (Informant 2)

Informant 5 said that the following government, if right-extreme, will probably continue
generating fake news, as this nourishes the fundamental part of their political discourse warfare - with active and inactive guerrilla-groups as their fundamental reason for
surviving.
Recently, the President of the Colombian Truth Commission, Francisco de Roux, said that
if Colombia kept a minute of silence due to the deaths caused by the war in Colombia, we
would have to stay silent for 16 years. [This phrase is on Francisco de Roux’s twitter feed]

Emma Saarela
According to informant’s fake news has been a way of discrediting what was agreed in
the peace accords and a way of delegitimizing the actors, hence, limiting their future
political possibilities.
Fake news affected the peace process greatly, distorted this important milestone for
Colombia, leading to the loss of a unique opportunity for Colombia. (Informant 9)

7.4 Summary of the data

The informant were able to share strong and initiated views on the peace process in the
country, the marketing of politics and the impact that false news has had on the peace
process, and the societal development in the country. Themes that reoccur in the
informants' statements include the lack of knowledge about, and the different established
views on, the historical causes that underlie the current situation among different
population groups, control of the media, organized dissemination of falsified messages,
misinformation, intimidation propaganda (scaremongering), dissemination of rumours,
mistrust, increased polarization among the population, and a failed implementation of the
peace agreements in the peripheral areas.
The informants expressed genuine worry about the current situation in Colombia.
Something that occurred continuously throughout the interviews was the expression of a
disappointment in how the peace process has been handled, and the continuous emphasise
of how complex a process it has been. The respondents emphasised the lack of guarantees
for victims of the conflict, the lack of statal presence in rural areas and how the most
vulnerable part of the population is still not able to practice their rights.
During the interviews, the informants stated that the peace agreement presented an
opportunity for Colombia to reach an advancement that had not earlier been possible due
to the armed conflict, but an opportunity that has not been well handled. The peace
agreement has been viewed positively in the international community, but there has been
a lack of pedagogy for the ordinary citizen. The victims should, according to the
informants, have been the protagonists for the peace agreement, but the warzone was left
81

Emma Saarela
with no voice. The government lacked assertiveness to manage and communicate the
achievements and benefits of the agreement, losing the opportunity to be the active
presenter of the peace agreement.
During the interviews it became clear that the informants perceive Colombia as a deeply
socio-economically divided society, that suffers from many structural problems, and
consequently also makes the distribution of power very unequal - not only the statal
power, but also the power of the media and information distribution. According to the
informants, the Colombian citizenry has not found common consensus to what reasons
behind the conflict has been, and what the fundamental problems are.
Regarding perceptions of societal implications of fake news in Colombia the informants
stated that the fake news has further polarized the population, not only before voting for
the referendum, but throughout the peace process. The general view among the
informants was that fake news has played a major role in forming attitudes among the
Colombian population towards the peace agreement. The vulnerable situation in
Colombia has been used to manipulate the citizenzry with fake news by groups of power
and/or ideological and financial interest are handling the information distribution.
According to informants the actual reporting of how the implementation is going, has not
been managed. The fake news about how much is progressing, is the official version.

8 Analysis

In this chapter the analysis of the thesis will be presented. The abductive analysis is built
upon the empirical investigation and the theoretical frame of reference. The analysis
begins by discussing social constructionist perspectives on factors that have affected
perceptions of communicated political agenda during the peace process in Colombia,
followed by an analysis of fake news and the unethical application of marketing methods
to the Colombian political spectrum. The final part of this chapter presents an analysis
of the societal implications of fake news in Colombia.

8.1 A social constructionist perspective on factors that have affected
perceptions of communicated political agenda during the peace
process in Colombia

According to the theoretical frame of reference, it is possible to establish that social
constructionism is an applicable theory that establish how the social environment
(cultural, historical and social context of life), and how social interactions impact the way
people perceive their surroundings, other people and the information at hand. The
empirical investigation shows data that, analysed through a social constructionist
perspective, can enable a deeper understanding of the different perceptions of
communicated political agenda in Colombia during the peace process.
As described in detail earlier (chapter 2.1.), social constructionism finds three
fundamental processes as responsible for social phenomena: externalization,
objectivation

and

internalization.

When

examining

perceptions

of

political

communication, it is necessary to examine the constructions of the cultural, social, and
historical context, and to establish who has the possibility to communicate, who is at the
receiving end, and the potential of the public to critically examine the information at hand.
According to social constructionism, knowledge is created in daily interactions with other
people. Things and phenomena do not have the same meaning or value in every
83

Emma Saarela
community. We talk about different things, in different ways, and different languages in
different communities and constructs. In short, one can say that perceptions are influenced
by values, values that one has acquired from the environment one has lived in – perhaps
even from previous generations. For a situation like the one in Colombia, where a spiral
of violence would need to be broken, this theoretical approach can easily be justified.
As Robinson (2019) stated, the prosperity of a country depends on the social, political,
and economic inclusion of the citizenry. Individual participation is the essence of
democracy (Krishna, 2008). A democracy is a social construction, a communal
agreement. Colombia identifies itself as a democracy. Hence, the prosperity of Colombia
must be analysed through how democratic values are met. A democracy is both a way of
organizing societies, and a way of solving the question of power. Some fundamentals of
democracy are free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, fundamental
human rights, that all people are equal before the law and the right to demonstrate. As
Strömbäck (2003) stated, by examining those in power, informing the public and allowing
different views and cultural expressions to be spoken (objective) journalism can
contribute to a better functioning democracy.
According to social constructionism we are victims of internalized truth, in other words,
constructed social truths. We put labels, and hence value, on ourselves and others around
us. This is greatly demonstrated in Colombia were the division into social classes still
exist. People are hence victims of a category – system.
As the data reveals, Colombia faces obvious challenges by the threats of organized crime,
illegal mining, drug production and -trafficking, human rights violations, limited freedom
of speech, murders, forced displacements and disappearances, among other things.
Peasants have been continuously forced to plant coca bushes as the coca leaf is the only
thing that has commercial outlet in the areas where there is no infrastructure (access only
by trail) and where there are no schools nor healthcare. The sectors that have governed
the Colombian society since colonial times occupy the Presidency, the seats in congress
and are owners of the media. They have militarized the processes of disarming
paramilitary, hence, leaving them without capacity to demand compliance, implying that,
historically, the arms have been the only option for them to make a political stance.

84

Emma Saarela
Furthermore, the victims of the conflict are not recognized as full political actors in the
Colombian political system. The peace negotiations were limited to the government and
one single guerrilla, hence, leaving out millions of victims and other armed groups –
leaving gaps in the implementations of the peace agreement. This suggests a distribution
of power that it very centralized and isolated to benefit the elites, leaving very little room
for other voices (people from the rural areas, minorities, victims, former guerrilla) to be
heard and considered in the decision making. In other words, even if Latin Americans in
general, poor and/or rich, are equally politically active and committed to democracy
(Krishna, 2008), during the Colombian peace process, many of the important actors have
been left out from the peace negotiations and process. The data hence suggest that there
are very many challenges to the democracy and democratic values in Colombia.
Social constructionism is a theory that implies that meanings and hence, opinions, are
developed in coordination with others. As mentioned earlier (chapter 3.2.), the general
discourse focuses on whether the voter preferences are shaped by political elements or by
the effects of the social environment. (Coban & Ozturk, 2019) As McLeod (1997) stated,
understanding is a result of careful analysis of the historical and cultural context of social
life. Social tension and segregation pave way for the spread of disinformation (chapter
4.3.1.). According to Krishna (2008) a special burden on democracy is the insufficient
education, in Colombia. The lack of education (some areas even total absence of schools)
in Colombia suggest that the potential and for many Colombians to critically analyse
information, among other things, is inadequate. In the case of Colombia, some of the
structural conditions and social tensions, alongside inadequate education, are; the
aftermaths of colonialism, the absence of a common truth regarding the understanding of
the history of the conflict and why the FARC armed itself in the first place, inequalities,
limited freedom of speech, newspapers historically owned by politically prestige families,
and media houses today owned by profit-driven corporations, political and economic
corruption, and organized crime, among other things.
According to social constructionism speech and created narratives has a central role in
the creation of the social world. In Colombia, the territories of war have no voice, and the
regions that have been little affected have been the voices opposing a peace agreement.
If we look at the history of Colombia through a social constructionist perspective, it is
clear how very different the social constructions of the society are in different settings
85

Emma Saarela
(e.g. Peripheral areas – elites in the cities, former combatants – victims of the conflict).
In other words, greatly differing perceptions of the peace process and of the political
communication exist.
The media houses in Colombia today are owned by big Colombian corporations with
financial interests. Previous data stated that minorities have very little representation in
the media and the information distribution is very biased. According to Cheminant &
Parrish (2011) media owners stand to gain market shares by injecting more, rather than
less, political bias to the news as the news audience increasingly polarizes through
questions of politics and ideology. When the audience is polarized, novel news makes for
market success.
The political polarization in Colombia has given rise to certain parties, leaders and other
political forces that are taking advantage of this polarization creating narratives to attack
the peace agreement, and according the data, the political polarization is what has affected
the implementation of the peace agreement the most. The data suggests political
manipulation as political forces are trying to gain control over the voting market through
emotional manipulation (Chapter 3.2.2.).
According to social constructionism there are multiple realities, and multiple moralities.
The data suggests a relatively subjective handling of the communication of the peace
process. The conflict zone has not been able to give its voice and to be the protagonist in
the absence of a more successful handling of the communication of the conflict and the
peace agreement. On the contrary, regions that have been little affected were the voices
for the attainments of opposing the peace agreement.
The data suggests that there is a very limited, and partisan communication that is not
allowing different views and cultural expressions to be spoken, suggesting herestethic
power (Chapter 3.2.1.), where agenda setters determine what gets attention in the public
sphere. According to the data, communication by the media houses in Colombia, is thus
not, at its whole, contributing to a better functioning democracy.

86

8.2 Fake news – the unethical application of marketing methods to
the Colombian political spectrum

Bringing something, making something, or building something into being, that had no
existence previously, is central to social constructionism. Social actors develop a concept
and then figure out ways to make it concrete (Galbin, 2014)
The ultimate, concrete goal of political marketing is generally to influence the individual
citizen’s decision-making (voter behaviour and other activity) and decision-making goes
far beyond the rational calculation and evaluation of possibilities. (Ledoux, 1996). As
suggested by statistics (Chapter 6.2.1.) there is a limited reach to platforms, hence,
information, for 40% of Colombians due to socioeconomic factors, 73% of Colombians
do not know how to identify fake news, and 47% of Colombians do not question what
they read on the internet. Furthermore, in the new media environment, as the theory
suggest, a news consumer can tailor the style and substance of the news to fit their own
ideological preferences, in other words, there is a homogeneity in the consumption of
information on the internet. This suggest an environment where it is easy to spread
disinformation and propagate propaganda, and each side of the debate is armed with their
own version of the truth.
As stated in the data, Colombia is a socio-economically divided society. Fake news often
needs the nourishment of troubled times and structural divisions to take root, and it is
exactly in this context that fake news finds its consumer (Goldman, 2016). The informants
pointed out how a vulnerable situation in Colombia is used by political figures to
propagate their propaganda.

Political marketing is, among other things (Chapter 3.1.), used to address different voter
concerns and control political and electoral campaigns. Political marketing can be used
to change agenda in the media and the public sphere, thus, advance ideology, policy,
causes and legislation. Decision- making acts below the threshold of intentionality and
consciousness (Connolly & Zeelenberg, 2002), and when in conflict, resulting in emotion,
clearly overriding reasoning (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017).

87

Emma Saarela
The data gathered from informants suggest that Colombia, at least to some extent, finds
itself in a post-truth era which is defined by “emotions over reasoning” (Rúas &
Capdevila, 2017), that even further polarizes the public. According to Rúas and Capdevila
(2017) there is an interest in gaining control of the voting market through emotional
manipulation, which is easier in a social spectrum where facts are less important than the
sensations they produce. In 2020, former President Santos admitted that fake news had a
great impact in misrepresenting what the peace agreement really meant and that he
underestimated the power of social networks and fake news. This was demonstrated when
the 51% of the Colombian population voted NO for the referendum of the peace
agreement.
Polarization makes it easier for content creators to inject more political bias in the news,
and hence, increase their market share (emotional capitalism, Chapter 3.2.) The unequal
fight that led to negative results of the referendum for peace and to the recent presidential
elections, was described as going under the scheme “Colombia cannot end up like
Venezuela”. Through massive messaging chains, the belief that voting NO to the
agreement would be the best option to avoid becoming the “next Venezuela” and
“protecting the family”, was massively advertised. In a later stage, the promoters of the
campaign admitted that these had been ways to convince the population to vote NO.
(Cabrera, 2020) This kind of advertising can be directly understood as the unethical use
of marketing methods to gain control over the voting market.
The phenomenon of fake news in Colombia in the recent years was described as the
transfer of confrontation between the political right and anyone who does not agree with
their actions or forms. Fake news has been accepted in alternative communication
channels, such as communal councils and social networks. The literate left has tried
challenging them, but with less economic and political power.
According to the data Fake news has functioned as a justification for evading the
implementation of what was agreed and have allowed attention to divert to invented
situations. According to Cheminant and Parrish (2011) this is the basic idea of
heresthetics: The powerful can systematically use hereshetics to obscure their own actions
and avoid accountability in a way that outsiders find difficult to understand.

88

Emma Saarela
Political and media mismanagement in Colombia, overshadowed the relevance of the
agreement, the history, and what the peace agreement could represent for the country’s
dynamics. Especially, for the future communities where the FARC had power and
historical presence. From a social constructionism perspective fake news are a way of
externalizing disinformation into the society, as a manipulative way of driving an
ideological or financial agenda, or both. According to informants, Colombia has always
been manipulated with disinformation, and the actual reporting of how the
implementation is going, has not been managed, so the fake news about how much it is
progressing, is the official version.
Marketing should be defined based on what the goal of outcome is. In that sense; straight
and honest. In a democracy, the goals of politics should be democratic, fair, and ethical.
Hence, Fake News can be understood, not as political marketing, but as the unethical use
of marketing methods, in other words, political manipulation.

8.3 The societal implications of Fake news in Colombia

Taking advantage of Colombia being a socio-economically very divided country, to
promote scaremongering and manipulation, is not only political manipulation, but it is
drawing attention away from relevant issues in society that would benefit from the publics
full attention.
Rúas and Capdevila (2017) highlights that the loss of credibility and the general lack of
trust in politicians has placed political communication in a scenario of a rising left-wing
and right-wing population, in other words, a deepened polarization. According to the
empirical research, there has been an increased mistrust in the people that are to live the
agreement, leading to, for example, former leaders of the FARC returning to arms. As
mentioned before, the polarization in Colombia was perfectly demonstrated in the results
of the voting of the referendum that ended in 49% of the voters voting for and 51% against
the peace agreement.
Fake news in Colombia regarding the peace process has mainly been about
scaremongering, creating mistrust in the citizenry during campaigns and elections,
89

Emma Saarela
ultimately affecting the way people vote and the judgment of the outcomes of elections.
The data suggest that there is a lack of common ground for the political left and the
political right. As mentioned, in politics, the voter’s judgment of a choice can be as crucial
as the outcome of an election. (Cheminant & Parrish, 2017) Colombia has been polarized
and prone by conflict for decades, but as mentioned before, according to the data, fake
news has polarized the Colombian people even further.
Many people today live in an attention economy, in other words, people are paying with
their attention. Politicians are in a large scale solely focusing on their personal interest
and driving so called “politician’s politics”. The media is, simultaneously, inflicting with
uncontrolled input and unverified information. (O’Cass, 1996) which, regarding
politically intended messages, consequently, has led to an increase in political
polarization. (Muqshith & Muzykant, 2019). The data stated that fake news began to
circulate even before the referendum, which already then further polarized the views of
the population.
One societal implication was also that misrepresentations of gender focus decisions
(minorities) began to circulate around the agreement, which motivated - as the intention
was - some religious variants to NOT support the plebiscite. The data suggested that the
disinformation surrounding the peace process has generated the withdrawal of interest on
and support for, the peace agreement, and for the FARC’s laying down of arms, as an
historic opportunity to deepen democracy in the country.
Culturally, there is an amnesia and indifference for the daily deaths of social leaders and
ex-combatants, which is alarming. Many of the informants stated that the ignorance is
because of the elites benefitting from the current structural conditions and distribution of
power, that the elites are distant from the society and that the peripheral country stays
outside the system. According to previous research (Chapter 6.1.1.) this kind of exclusion
in Colombia has historically generated guerrillas, drug trafficking and poverty.
There is a very large difference between the nature of communication strategies of the
individual political figure, and communication efforts of governments and public
institutions. In the recent years, politics and the media have largely been suffering from a
loss of credibility. From a social constructionist perspective, fake news has succeeded
when it is objectivated by society as it has developed a factual truth or existence. Fake
90

Emma Saarela
news generally has consequences, such as the polarization in Colombia, leading to,
among other things, radicalisation due to ideological views that are internalized into
society. As one of the former FARC- combatants explained to the author of the thesis
(chapter 6.4.3.), one of the goals with the peace process should be that young people
would no longer have to train for war, and that the government would guarantee education
for the people in the rural areas and land (that once was sold to private owners) to the
former guerrilla and people in the rural areas, so that they can work and hence, have an
equal chance to build and sustain a dignified life.
As of 2020, social leaders and former combatants are systematically disappearing and
being murdered as other former combatants are returning to arms. According to the data,
fake news has been a way of discrediting the peace agreement and delegitimizing the
actors, thus, limiting their future political possibilities.
Fake news has very real and, at times, devastating consequences (Goldman 2016). As the
Freedom House (2018) concluded, the peace process in Colombia has been strongly
affected and shaped by social media and the proliferation of misinformation, online
aggression, and fake news. The rise of ICTs and media technology has also been
significantly influential and damaging to the democratic process in Colombia, as they
narrow the audience’s political horizon.

According to social constructionism, the

narratives that are created (externalised) – are highly affect the outcome of things.
According to the social constructionist theory, the previous research, and the empirical
data, explain that social constructions affect not only how political communication is
interpreted in Colombia, but also how it is communicated.
During the negotiations of the peace agreement, the government lacked assertiveness to
manage and communicate the achievements and benefits of the agreement and lost the
opportunity in the presentation of the news. Political agenda, externalized, objectivated,
and internalized into new truths, have historically deepened polarization in Colombia, and
today, with the information landscape evolving, could continue to do so.

9 Final discussion
In this final chapter of the thesis, the result of the thesis is discussed, and the research
questions are answered, followed by an account of criticism of the research. The chapter
is concluded with suggestions for future research.

9.1 Results and answers to the research questions

The aim of this thesis was to map and analyse perceptions of how marketing and
communication of political agenda, in the form of fake news and misinformation, in the
various media channels, has affected the political climate and the democracy during the
(ongoing) peace process in Colombia.
The intention of this research was to create an image of the spread of fake news and
misinformation in general, as well as of its effect on the development in Colombia. A
one-year stay in the country made it possible to establish contacts with people who, on
behalf of their professions, and throughout their professional lives, have followed the
events in the country (e.g. as journalists, university professors, and political actors), as
well as to meet and discuss with people who have directly participated in the armed
conflict. To achieve a result, a comprehensive review of existing theory and an empirical
research was conducted.
Based on the theoretical frame of reference and the data collected in this thesis, one of
the conclusions of the this thesis is that Colombia is a good example of what the
consequence could be when there is no general access to accurate and correct information,
when the people that can manipulate will manipulate as they have agenda and the means
to do so, and

when there is no counterforce, like publicly available fact-checked

journalism.
It is important to recognize that Colombia as a case, is rather unique. The historical events
and happenings in Colombia, starting from the colonialization in the beginning of the 19th
century, have created deep socio-economical and socio-political differences that are
92

Emma Saarela
deeply rooted in society, and they require solutions that would demand severe structural
changes. As of today, the people in power have shown very little effort or interest in doing
so, and those who have, have their hands tied behind bureaucracy. The distance between
the rural areas and the epicentre of decision-making is immense; the voices of the conflict
are not heard, and the state has no presence in the rural areas where it is needed the most.
The lack of infrastructure, healthcare, and education in many parts of the country is a
perfect demonstration of the isolation of the rural areas. Still today, in 2020, equal rights
and opportunities for all people of Colombia are missing. Social leaders and former
guerrilla that are trying to create and encourage change, are disappearing and getting
murdered, and thousands of people are suffering forced displacement. Where the FARC
has left, there has been a lack of statal presence, and new guerrilla groups have arrived to
take their place. The peace agreement has not been implemented in the way and pace that
was promised, and many people are left in very vulnerable positions, with no means to
demand compliance. Therefore, as reflected upon in the data, many people felt safer
during war than during peace.
If there is interest to change structural conditions after 50 years of warfare, it is important
to create channels to evenly distribute and disseminate updated information about what
is happening. If there is information based on facts and basic knowledge among all
citizens, a rumour or a deliberately spread falsification can be confronted with and
weighed against information already obtained. Or the other way around: one single false
accusation actively distributed, if objectivated in society, can lead to a situation where
information arriving subsequently is questioned.
The government should have been proactive regarding the information around the peace
agreement and the peace process so that there would have been no vacuum of lack of
information. The information should have been correct and available for all, providing
the means to navigate and understand the peace agreement and its content and
implications fully. The peace agreement should have been presented with a neutral and
consistent description of the history of Colombia and how the unstable situation in
Colombia originally arose.
However, as the elites benefit from the current structural conditions and socio-economical
divisions and refuse to embrace change, the information distribution was handled
93

Emma Saarela
accordingly. At the same time, a constructive dialogue require that the government
recognizes its historical mistakes (e.g. land distribution), and that the state would pledge
to eliminate the conditions that cause structural violence in Colombia.
What is recurring in the secondary data and the informants’ statements is the ignorance
among different population groups about the situation in the country, both historically
and today. Previous events in the country’s history cannot be tolerated in retrospect if one
has never understood or known the causal connection that has motivated political parties
in their decisions.
Thus, the battle against fake news is foremost a political struggle, that transposes into the
media world as an ideological and partisan battle (e.g. the right wing versus the left wing
in Colombian politics) and a discourse around social classes (the experts, graduates and
urban populations versus the supposedly uneducated and easily influenced).
A long-lasting peace would require recognition, forgiveness, reconciliation, and
restoration of people’s basic human rights – and a transparent fact-based communication.
In the long run there should be focus on education, to strengthen democracy and equal
rights and opportunities, and a mission to build a common understanding or/and truth of
the history of the conflict in Colombia.
Both previously existing research and the primary data obtained in this research, suggest
that there is no common view of what the fundamental problems in the Colombian society
are, and they tell that the reason why Colombia has been in conflict for so long should be
revised.
According the social constructionist theory, every generation maintains and reaffirms
parts of the social world, recreating discarding and repairing others. We are not limited
to constructions; we can construct alternatives.
It is possible to dismantle structural problems by creating different narratives. However,
they need thorough examination. Social constructionism implies that cross-cultural
changes require collaborative effort. New realities are created based on everyone at the
table, hence, inviting, involving, and considering all parts concerned.

94

Emma Saarela
A democratic dialogue, based on reflections and the expression of reality, where strategics
are public and universal, could, in theory, lead to a recovery of confidence in politics.
How stories are told, according to social constructionism, often determines how we listen.
The social constructionism approach, the theory, and the data, hence suggest that the
peace process, implemented with all concerned parts actively involved, in theory, could
have presented a historical opportunity to promote the establishment of a peaceful and
democratically civil society in Colombia.
In conclusion, fundamental differences between existing theory and the results of the
research did not emerge. This research shows that fake news and misinformation are
issues affecting the goal to implement a peace agreement and long-lasting peace in
Colombia. They have been used as an unethical marketing tool to counteract and oppose
a transparency that has been needed and as a way of preserving current structural
conditions. The analysis of the perceptions of political discourse suggest that narratives
of hate, that are amplified by social media, increase violence. Transparent communication
is essential for a democracy and for bringing about change.
From a social constructionist standpoint, the results of this thesis are also a construction,
the conclusions are neither an objective truth nor a falsification of the truth, only a
demonstration of one perspective of the subject area.
In this part of the chapter, the research questions of the thesis are answered briefly
and concisely. The questions are presented in the same order as in the introduction
chapter (chapter 1) of the thesis.
•

In the context of the ongoing peace process in Colombia, what are fake news
and what is their societal impact?

In the context of the ongoing peace process in Colombia, fake new is a way to draw
attention form important matters, a way to discredit the peace agreements, and a way to
divide and polarize the country even further. Fake news generally has consequences, such
as polarization, leading to, among other things, radicalisation due to the polarized
ideological views.
95

Emma Saarela

•

How can different perceptions of communicated political agenda in
Colombia be understood from a social constructionism perspective?

With a social constructionist approach, one can explain the existence of several differing
perceptions of the history of Colombia and the current peace process in the country. There
is a lack of common ground in Colombia for what the history of the country is, and why
Colombia has been in conflict for over 50 years. In other words, there are many different
subjective truths, that consequently can explain how political communication is
understood differently throughout the Colombian society. From the type of modern
endless supply of “news” existing, everyone can personalize their consumption and find
information that support one’s own worldviews.

•

Can fake news be understood as the unethical application of marketing
methods to the political spectrum?

There are generally two motivations behind fake news: the financial motivation and the
ideological motivation. There is financial motivation behind fake news going viral and
providing content-creators with clicks that are convertible to advertising revenue. The
motivation is ideological when fake news stories are produced to promote ideas or people
that they favour, often discrediting others. Marketing should be defined based on what
the goals of outcome is. In that sense; straight and honest. In a democracy, the goal of
politics should be democratic, fair, and ethical. Hence, Fake News can be understood, not
as political marketing, but as the unethical use of marketing methods.

9.2 Criticism towards the thesis

As this thesis primarily applies a qualitative research approach to perceptions by people
with higher education on, the impacts of fake news and misinformation in the peace
96

Emma Saarela
process, the perceptions cannot be generalized across a population or larger masses. This
is something that could have been achieved by using a primarily quantitative method.
However, given the purpose of the research and the social constructionist approach, the
qualitative focus supported by secondary data, was the more appropriate choice of
method. A mixed-method approach provided a broad and more generalized understanding
of the research problem.
Nine informants were recruited for the empirical investigation in this thesis – based on
resources, schedule, and purpose of the thesis. All informants can be considered having
within the subject area. The thesis can be criticised for the limited number of informants.
Informants representing all social groups could have given a deeper understanding of the
phenomenon, possibly resulted in more varied data or further strengthened the
correlations in the data.
The interview guide that was designed for the interviews, focused on the key subject areas
to support the research problems and the purpose of thesis. Even though the interview
guide covers important subject matters, the interview guide could have focused on more
personal experiences and the backgrounds of the informants. This could have supported
the social constructionist approach even further and provided the research with more
varied data.
According to the social constructionist approach, there are no objective truths. Social
constructionism does not aim to find the truth, or eliminate any perspective, it is simply
a way of explaining things. Social constructionism also suggests that the (scientific)
observer is a part of a community, hence, the results are based on traditions of the
community to make a study. The analysis in this research is based on several subjective
truths, and the secondary data are constructed by other experts and the communities they
stem from. This research can thus not be described as objective from a social
constructionist perspective.

9.3 Suggestions for future research

There are several suggestions for further research to be found based on the subject areas
of this thesis. At the time of writing, we are living in a time when the belief in new media
and the power of electronically conveyed information is tremendous – the most exposed
example being the current president of the United States (2020) who seems to judge that
the power of social media is sufficient to even override the power of democratic
institutions. The author of this thesis thus feels a strong need for studies of the various
consequences of the free and uncontrolled use of the different medial tools. What actions
can be taken to promote new and critical media, and to broaden the capacities of the
common citizen to assess the credibility of information and information sources? What
are the possible consequences of further development of artificial intelligence on freedom
of speech? What are the potential risks of the development of artificial intelligence? And
will there be ethical limits of research and development of artificial intelligence?

Uppfattningar om konsekvenserna av falska nyheter
och felinformation

Inledning

Kommunikation är en nedärvd lust som präglar människan. Ingen ömsesidig förståelse
kan uppnås eller existera utan kommunikation av något slag. Kommunikation utgör
kärnan i mänskliga relationer, och därmed framskrider och fortskrider kultur och
civilisation i den mån som detta möjliggörs av kommunikation (Gergern, 1985).
Det sägs att vi lever i en informationsålder där datorer och nätverksteknologier har gjort
det möjligt för oss att övervinna begräsningar i tid och rum som tidigare präglat
kommunikation. Kommunikationen sker nu med större hastighet, i större utsträckning,
med större flexibilitet och har en större bredd av innehåll. (Al-Fedaghi, 2012)
Dagens globaliserade och digitaliserade värld och medielandskap gör det enklare än
någonsin för auktoritära ledare, såväl som olika icke-demokratiska stater, att sprida
propaganda. Många gånger verkar det vara viktigare att vinna debatter och sälja
kommersiella och emotionella budskap än att sprida fakta och kunskap. Colombia är en
korrupt nation som fortsättningsvis idag (2020) är ett av de farligaste länderna i världen
för journalister och aktivister, där felinformation och falska nyheter har präglat samhället
i hög utsträckning redan länge. I denna avhandling belyses uppfattningar om vilka
konsekvenser felinformation i media, om den colombianska fredsprocessen har, i
politiska miljön och samhället i stort. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017)
För att bilda sig en uppfattning om hur falska nyheter har påverkat det politiska klimatet
och

demokratin

i

Colombia

krävs

en

djupgående

förståelsekunskap

om

kommunikationskanalerna i medierna och hur felinformation används som ett verktyg i

Emma Saarela
politiska sammanhang. Därför behandlas följande ämnesområden utförligt i
avhandlingens teorikapitel: kommunikation, politisk marknadsföring, falska nyheter och
social konstruktivism. Det sistnämnda utgör både en forskningsstrategi och en
kommunikationsteori i denna pro Gradu-avhandling.
Social konstruktivism fokuserar på de metoder med vilka människor tillsammans
konstruerar en förståelse av världen. Detta innebär med andra ord att åsikter och den egna
uppfattningen om verklighet utvecklas i samspel med andra och följaktligen vävs in i den
sociala strukturen (Littlejohn & Foss, 2009).

Syfte och ämnesmotivering

År 2016 undertecknade de revolutionära beväpnade styrkorna i Colombia (FARC) och
president Santos regering ett gemensamt fredsavtal som kom att ”avsluta” mer än fem
decennier av våldsam konflikt. Idag är fredsavtalet nära en kollaps. Några orsaker till
detta är missnöjet med Colombias nya president Ivan Duque (vald 2018) – politisk
ersättare till före detta president Álvaro Uribe Vélez (som för närvarande är under
utredning av Högsta domstolen för hans påstådda roll i krigsförbrytelser), FARCbefälhavaren Ivan Marqués tillkännagivande om ”en ny fas av beväpnad kamp”, och den
sittande regeringens nedskärningar som en del av implementeringen av fredsavtalet. En
oroväckande

mängd

av

dödliga

attacker

riktade

mot

aktivister

och

människorättsförsvarare har lett till utmaningar gällande yttrandefriheten i Colombia.
Fredsprocessen i Colombia har påverkats, och formats starkt av sociala medier och
spridningen av felinformation, online-aggression och falska nyheter. (The Freedom
House, 2018) Därför är Colombia speciellt vid denna tidpunkt ett intressant objekt för
diskussion och forskning av detta slag.
Dagens forskning indikerar att den nuvarande politiska kommunikationen produceras
med målsättningen att uppnå den nödvändiga legitimiteten för media och medborgare.
Samtidigt söker människor efter autentiska drag för att kunna lite på det politiska
etablissemanget. Traditionella och nya medier spelar en viktig roll när det gäller
ansträngningen att överbrygga avståndet mellan politiska kandidater, partier, regeringar,
100

institutioner och medborgare. (Rúas & Capdevila, 2017) Redan år 2013 kom World
Economic Forum ut med en rapport som fastslog att felinformation är att betrakta som en
global och brådskande utmaning. Felinformation kan inte bemötas eller bekämpas endast
genom att peka finger på dem som skapar eller betalar för skapandet av innehåll, utan det
råder också ett behov av att undersöka de strukturella förhållandena som banar väg för
felinformationen och falska nyheter (Hendricks & Vestergaard, 2017). Falska nyheter och
deras samhällspåverkan är därmed ett mycket intressant och aktuellt forskningsområde.
Syftet med denna avhandling är att ge en sammanhängande och grundlig bild av
fenomenet i fråga genom att kartlägga och analysera uppfattningar om hur
marknadsföring och kommunikation av politisk agenda, i form av falska nyheter och
felinformation, i olika mediekanaler har påverkat det politiska klimatet och demokratin
under (den pågående) fredsprocessen i Colombia

Presentation av metod och material

Eftersom syftet med denna pro Gradu-avhandling är att analysera och kartlägga hur falska
nyheter har påverkat det politiska klimatet och demokratin under fredsprocessen, har en
metodkombination tillämpats som forskningsansats. Med andra ord har både kvalitativa
och kvantitativa forskningsmetoder tillämpats.
Ostrukturerade och semi-strukturerade intervjuer har utförts för att försöka besvara
forskningsfrågorna, medan sekundära data i form av tidigare forskning, Internetkällor,
statistik och Nätnografi har studerats för att bredda kunskapen om sammanhangen och
för att kunna tolka och förstå forskningsproblemet mer djupgående.

Redogörelse för undersökningen

Den empiriska delen av forskningen utgörs av 9 individuella, ostrukturerade och semistrukturerade djupintervjuer med olika colombianska samhällsaktörer (bland annat
101

Emma Saarela
journalister och akademiker). En stor del av intervjuerna har genomförts per telefon och
en del via datorkommunikation, på grund av distansen (Colombia – Finland). Tillika har
före detta FARC-soldater och före detta vice presidenten intervjuats (2018), för att ge en
mer komplett bild av hur fredsprocessen bemötts av olika aktörer, och hur konflikten
påverkat människor i olika områden och olika livssituationer.
Data har samlats in baserat på informanternas personliga erfarenheter, observationer och
livssituationer. Det vill säga ur ett socialkonstruktivistiskt perspektiv.

Resultat

Resultatet har tagits fram på basen av en sammanställning av avhandlingens empiriska
resultat och den teoretiska referensramen.
Sammanfattningsvis konstaterar denna forskning att falska nyheter och felinformation
inte är de största utmaningarna som präglar Colombia och påverkar möjligheterna att
genomföra en fredsprocess med målet att åstadkomma permanent fred i landet. Däremot
har falska nyheter och felinformation utnyttjats som ett oetiskt marknadsföringsverktyg
för att distrahera konstruktiv dialog och transparens som hade varit nödvändigt för en
hållbar implementation av fredsavtalet. Forskningen tyder på att hatpropaganda förstärks
av sociala medier, förstärker polariseringen i landet, och ökar osäkerhet bland
befolkningen. Transparent kommunikation är nödvändigt för en demokrati, och för att
åstadkomma hållbara strukturella förändringar. Fred i Colombia skulle förutsätta
erkännande, förlåtelse, försoning och återställande av människors grundläggande
mänskliga rättigheter, samt en transparent och faktabaserad kommunikation.
Ur ett socialkonstruktivistiskt perspektiv, är även resultaten av denna forskning
konstruerade. Med andra ord utgör resultaten ingen objektiv sanning, eller falsifiering av
sanningen, utan bidrar med en demonstration av ett perspektiv på ämnesområdet i fråga.

Appendix 1

El título preliminar de mi investigación es: “Técnicas de marketing político: Una
perspectiva social construccionista acerca de la distribución de noticias en el proceso de
paz en Colombia – percepciones sobre el impacto de las noticias falsas y la
desinformación en el proceso de paz en Colombia”.
Es por lo anterior que me gustaría conocer su perspectiva personal acerca del proceso de
paz y el impacto de las noticias falsas y la desinformación.
He escogido este tema para mi tesis debido a que encuentro muy importante establecer
contacto entre los países nórdicos y Colombia, teniendo en cuenta, claro está, los
diferentes antecedentes históricos que los caracterizan.
He preparado seis preguntas que me encantaría usted pudiera responder (puede ser de
manera escrita u oral, lo que más le convenga).
Por favor, no permita que las preguntas restrinjan la presentación de sus opiniones o
puntos de vista acerca del tema. Estoy muy interesada en escuchar sus opiniones más
profundas sobre estos asuntos.
1.

¿Podría, por favor, contarme acerca de usted? Enfocado en su experticia en
el área de mi investigación.

2.

En relación con el proceso de paz, ¿podría darme, en sus propias palabras,
una visión general del proceso de paz tal como lo ha experimentado?

3.

¿Qué factores han afectado el proceso de paz (de manera positiva o
negativa)?

4.

¿Qué tanto ha afectado las noticias falsas y la desinformación al proceso de
paz? ¿Qué efectos han generado?

5.

¿Qué tanto han afectado las noticias falsas y la desinformación al proceso
de paz en las siguientes etapas:
a)

Contacto inicial entre el gobierno del presiente Santos y las FARC.

b)

Inicios de las conversiones entre el gobierno del presidente Santos y las
FARC.

c)

Negociaciones entre el gobierno y las FARC

d)

Implementación del acuerdo de paz entre el gobierno del presidente
