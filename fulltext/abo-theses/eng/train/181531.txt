Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
The extensive use of data-hungry devices has heavily increased mobile data traffic.
5G is a solution that can keep up with the increasing data volume. 5G has been on
the carpet for almost a decade, and the roll-out has finally begun in several countries.
The market shapers must get consumers to adopt 5G so that other companies want
to start investing in 5G services. This thesis studied the consumer reactions to
market-shaping methods used to improve the current market of mobile networks or
develop entirely new technology, depending on one’s stance. A cross-sectional
electronic questionnaire survey was chosen in this thesis, and the data was collected
through Finnish consumers with a sample size of 187. The results indicate that a
successful market-shaping strategy results in a more significant adoption rate. The
way a consumer views the technology affects their interest in it. Also, the need for
a fast-speed internet connection significantly influences the consumers’ interest in
the technology. Coverage, cheaper subscriptions, innovative applications, improved
battery life were important things to develop for consumers who had not adopted
the technology. The early adopters of 5G answered coverage, innovative
applications, improved battery life, and cheaper subscriptions. A minority of the
respondents were concerned about potential health effects, information leaks, and
environmental effects.
Keywords: 5G, marketing, consumer

1. Introduction
This chapter explains what the thesis is all about. The first chapter begins with a thesis
presentation, followed by problem areas and information about 5G in Finland. Then
comes problem discussion, followed by research questions and purpose. The
introductory chapter will end with delimitations and term definitions.

1.1 Thesis background
5G cellular networks has been a topical issue ever since Neelie Kroes, the former VicePresident of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda, gave a
powerful speech about 5G in 2013 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Kroes
called on the E.U. industries and other partners to join in a public-private partnership
to form an open platform to reach the goal of establishing 5G coherently, directly, and
quickly. She added that establishing European 5G is an “unmissable” opportunity to
capture a global technological leadership position. Europe has the funds, the will, and
the expertise to succeed in this field (Kroes, 2013, p. 3).
If we don’t provide the spectrum, the networks, or the most up-to-date technology, then
that innovation just won’t be possible: we would be blocking off tomorrow’s
opportunities. And I don’t think citizens of any generation, would forgive us that.
(Kroes, 2013, p. 3)
According to Dunnewijk & Hultén (2007, p. 164), in the early 1950s, mobile telephony
was introduced in Europe, and ever since, the demand for this service has increased
exponentially. The development of mobile telecommunication has advanced in
successive generations of technologies, the first of which appeared in the 1950s and is
called 1G. GSM technology is the second generation (2G) of mobile
telecommunication technologies, and it is used globally as all the later technologies.
The third generation (3G) brought the Internet to mobile devices, and 4G enabled
increased transmission speeds. Future generations of mobile telecommunication
technologies will further increase transmission speeds.

1

Anasia D’mello (2019) argues that in recent years the extensive use of data-hungry
devices by consumers and organizations has heavily increased mobile data traffic and
inspired researchers to develop network designs that support speeds of multiple Gbit/s
for a 5G network to meet the increasing data demand. Building a comprehensive 5G
network is time-consuming. It requires radical changes to the network paradigm to
satisfy the future need of the Internet of Things (IoT) and device-to-device
communication with high-traffic and low latency requirements. 5G can reach speeds
up to 10 Gbit/s, which is approximately 100 times faster than 4G. The speed and
bandwidth of 5G could be an effective way to replace the popular Wi-Fi internet
connections.
According to James Edmondson (2020), 5G technology can support products and
services worth up to €3.8 trillion in industries such as education, entertainment, retail,
healthcare, and transportation. Edmondson claims that 80 percent of business leaders,
analysts, and technology professionals believe that 5G will drive business growth,
increase productivity, efficiency, and accessibility. 5G technology provides fast
downloading for its users, and in the future, for example, fully autonomous cars and
smarter homes will offer a different reality than today’s IoT. Many consumers might
be wondering why they should pay for potential future benefits today. They can most
likely acquire both the 5G devices and subscriptions less expensively when there are
actual IoT products and services in the market that require 5G to function. Some
consumers have genuine fears and concerns associated with 5G technology. A
minority of consumers believe in various 5G conspiracy theories, and there are
petitions to stop the roll-out of the technology. The topic has been extensively
discussed in public discourse, albeit also widely debunked. More valid concerns might
be information leaks and privacy risks, which have also been a topical issue in the
public discourse.
A 5G mobile phone needs a data-intensive 5G signal for heavy tasks and maintains
connections to 3G or LTE networks for essential phone functions. Maintaining several
connections drains the battery life quickly, and most phones lose half of their battery
in a few hours of 5G use (Thomsen, 2020). Half a million 5G users grew tired of the
low signals in South Korea and decided to switch back to using 4G. Companies have
not yet created 5G applications that would attract consumers to upgrade, and jokes,
such as “SpeedTest is the only true 5G app,” spread in social media (Zhe, 2020). In
2

China, enthusiasm is high; almost every second consumer is planning to purchase a
5G phone immediately when the service is available. Only 15-20% of the consumers
in Europe and 30% in the U.S. feel the same way (GSMA Intelligence, 2020).
In 2016, most of the wireless telecom industry’s significant announcements included
strong statements about 5G. Governments, politicians, organizations, and entities
worldwide wanted to be associated with 5G because of the future vision it promised.
Although the technology has advanced since 2016, skepticism towards 5G has grown
(Webb 2019, p. 7).
Although 5G is still in such an early phase, it remains to be seen whether it will be the
next important thing or not. Consumers are essential first users of 5G diffusion because
companies are more willing to invest in creating 5G services when there are many
users. The early-adopting businesses utilizing the technology and creating innovations
are essential for the success of 5G. Companies still believe in 5G, and carriers are
increasingly investing in 5G stations to expand the coverage area and aggressively
market the 5G subscriptions to increase the 5G customer base. They all want to be seen
as pioneers, offering the latest technology (Maeng et al. 2020, p. 1).

1.2 Problem discussion
Markets can be simple or complex. Going into a barbershop to buy a haircut in
exchange for money is an example of a simple market. In this situation, it is easy and
straightforward for both parties to reach an agreement because the seller is also the
service provider. The situation is more complicated in more significant trades or when
more actors are involved (Pekkarinen & Sutela, 2005, p. 36). In today’s world, markets
are complicated and developing ecosystems. Market actors should be able to embrace
the complexity in order to thrive (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2018, p. 1). Companies want
to sell technical innovations to consumers, and they use market-shaping methods to do
so, but consumers may be more or less interested in adopting these innovations.
Technology is evolving rapidly, bringing new opportunities to companies and bringing
innovations that make consumers’ daily lives more comfortable and practical.
However, innovations can have their downsides. Companies need to be always on their
toes, recognize and react immediately to disruptive innovation or other breakthroughs
3

that may change an industry’s competitive patterns. From a consumer perspective,
innovations may be helpful to some and harmful or scary for others. Marketing firms
try to reach consumers everywhere, and an average consumer encounters between
6000 to 10000 ads daily, although there are no official figures. Those figures make one
question how the human brain copes with the permanent information overload (Carr,
2020).
Sometimes consumers are forced to adopt a technology, and some people think that
innovations might produce much change in their daily lives and disorder their routines.
They might be afraid of an innovation not being thoroughly examined before the
launch and have harmful side effects. These factors can cause innovation resistance in
consumers, which might slow down the innovation’s takeoff time and result in delayed
investment returns. In the worst case, the product is drawn from the market before
sales have a chance to grow, resulting in negative payback (Garcia et al., 2007).
The coverage of 5G is improving, but it is still constrained to the central area of bigger
cities. The use of 5G is not problem-free either in cities where it has already been
implemented. If users want a notably faster connection than what 4G can offer, they
should be close to a 5G telecommunication tower without having buildings or other
obstacles on the way. The 5G network is still developing, and several 5G mobile
devices have not been able to keep up with the network development. Many of the
early devices do not support the network that has the best coverage result. Many
consumers have already bought one of these devices, which means that they will be
left out of most of the 5G expansion if they do not purchase a new device (Conteras,
2020).
It is challenging for a typical person to know what information to trust or not trust
because the internet is full of conspiracy theories about 5G. Some believe it is a health
hazard, the cause, or an accelerator for COVID-19. Others think it can kill birds and
plant life or that the lockdown is a government conspiracy to install 5G antennas en
masse (Destiny, 2020). These myths have been widely debunked, but they still
circulate in many social media echo chambers.
According to Waterson and Herne (2020), people are trying to make sense of the world
after Covid-19 turned everything upside down. The networks have failed to promote
scientific evidence about 5G, and the rapid increase of community social media groups
4

has helped spread several nonsense theories about 5G. Vosoughi et al. (2018, p. 3)
studied how false news on Twitter spread compared to factual news. The results
indicated that it takes about six times as long for the truth to reach 1500 people than
something false. False news is also much more likely to become retweeted and
successively passed on.
5G makes it possible for an increasing amount of physical objects to be connected to
the internet. These can be devices, such as robot vacuums, rings, and microwaves.
Intelligent IoT equipment may significantly improve the life quality of its user.
However, the connected devices usually ask end-users to input their age, gender, name,
zip code, email address, and other sensitive personal information. An intelligent robot
vacuum collects data to identify the walls and furniture in a house to avoid crashing.
However, it can also create and share an accurate map of the house to the cloud. Every
smartphone has a built-in GPS (global positioning system) to increase convenience
and improve users’ life quality. However, it could be dangerous if the information gets
into the wrong hands.
The digital divide is widening because the 5G network coverage has not been seen as
the primary goal. Many of the adopted designs are not perfectly synchronized with the
needs of universal mobile coverage. The primary focus with every generation of
mobile telecommunication technology has concentrated on the peak data rate, while
coverage has been underemphasized. In this early stage of the 5G adoption, it is
eminent that nothing has changed. The new technology’s performance targets are
ambitious, but the coverage goals have been modest (Al-Dulaimi et al., 2018, p. 314).
To fill the gap between the urban and the rural coverage to provide universal highspeed internet connection is a significant challenge (Al-Dulaimi et al., 2018. p. 301).
According to the European 5G Observatory (2020), the global 5G race is getting more
intense. Since the beginning of 2019, the number of live 5G networks has significantly
increased across Europe. Commercial 5G services were deployed already in 14 of the
EU-27 plus the UK countries by the end of June 2020. The 5g network has expanded
rapidly, but only in densely populated areas. Despite the hype around 5G and its high
predicted growth, there are also many concerns, uncertainties, and signs of decreased
enthusiasm towards 5G.

5

Market-shaping companies influence the consumers by building credibility and
understanding the customers (Kindström et al., p.44). Companies can then move to
improve consumer practices and co-create more use-value for the consumer. It might
bring new products, services, extensions, or information forth to the consumer.
Consumers can also be influenced by bringing in new actors or new images (Nenonen
& Storbacka, 2018, p. 68-69).
According to William Webb (2019, p.7), 5G expectations were enormous in 2016. In
most of the wireless telecom industry’s significant announcements, the 5G played a
considerable part. The future vision that 5G promised led to the fact that governments,
politicians, organizations, and entities worldwide wanted to be associated with the
technology. Skepticism towards 5G has grown, and there is still a lot to be done,
although the technology has advanced since 2016.
In November 2017, Vodafone’s chief technology officer (CTO) stated that 5G was
overhyped and the key benefit was efficiency gains, while BT’s chief executive officer
(CEO) said that neither he nor many of the other CEO’s he talked to could find a
business case for 5G.
(Webb, 2019, p. 7)

1.3 Research Questions and purpose
This thesis aims to answer the following research questions with its content:
RQ1: How is consumer adoption of technology related to market shaping?
RQ2a: What influences consumers’ interest in 5G technology in Finland?
RQ2b: What explains consumers’ health concerns related to 5G in Finland?
RQ3: Given the consumers’ attitudes to 5G, how should the mobile communication
technology vendors shape the 5G market in Finland?
RQ1 will be answered by studying the existing literature on the topic. The gathered
empirical data would be analyzed and provide answers to RQ2a and RQ2b. The
literature and the data analysis will help give a normative answer for the RQ3. This
thesis summarize previously conducted scientific studies on market-shaping,
consumer behavior, technology adoption theories. The literature and the conducted
6

survey help companies on how to tackle consumer innovation resistance towards 5G.
This study aims to explore consumer perceptions of 5G in Finland from a marketshaping perspective. The theoretical part of this study examines how companies try to
shape the market to fit their purposes. It also examines consumer behavior and the
adoption of technological innovations. Consumers are crucial initial users for the
technology to be successful, making it essential to understand them and what they
indicate with their adoption or non-adoption.

1.4 Delimitations
As the topic reveals, the thesis examines Finnish consumers, and every member of the
Finnish society is a consumer either directly or indirectly. Under 18- and over 80-yearold consumers will be left out of this study’s empirical part. The decision was made
because a researcher should be extra careful when dealing with children, and no one
over 80-year-old participated in the study. No further delimitations were made to the
population because the writer was interested in getting data from a broad spectrum of
different people. A quantitative research method with positivistic philosophy and
deductive approach was chosen for this thesis. A survey was used to find answers to
the research questions. Because of the consumer perspective and the early stage of 5G,
this thesis considered only the mobile communication sphere of operation. Future
research could concentrate on how 5G has affected the efficiency of IoT and cloud
services.

1.5 Definitions
Innovation = An idea, object, or practice that individuals or other adoption units
perceive as new (Rogers, 1995, p. 418). Talukder (2014, p. 9) defines innovation as an
idea or a system or a new or significantly improved technology.
Market shaping = Companies often try to adapt themselves to suit the market.
However, market-shaping turns this traditional view upside down and shows how a
firm can adapt the market to the firm, opening up unexploited value in the process
(Nenonen & Storbacka, 2018, p. 1).

7

Consumer behavior = Khan (2006, p. 4-5) defines consumer behavior as the decisionmaking process and physical activity, which involves evaluating, acquiring, using, and
disposing of goods and services. The buying process starts in the consumer’s minds
and leads to finding alternatives between products, weighing the different options, and
leading to internal and external research. The decision-making process for purchase
and using the goods comes next. Finally, post-purchase behavior is also significant for
marketers because it clarifies whether consumers like the product or not (Khan, 2006,
p.4).
Consumer adoption = When consumers accept and purchase new brands or products.
The adoption rate determines whether or not a new product continues to be sold or is
withdrawn from the market (Collins Dictionary of Business, 2005).

1.6 Structure of the Thesis
This thesis contains a total of six chapters. The introductory chapter offers a general
overview of the thesis, its research area, research questions, and critical concepts and
delimitations. The Theoretical Framework in chapter two gives a basic overview of
the current research and theory available to us through journals and other literary
forms. The focus of this thesis lies on theories that form an underlining foundation
for the conducted research. The chapter will focus on market-shaping, different
marketing strategies, technology adoption life-cycle, and how a consumer’s mind
works, and how one can efficiently target it. The hypothesis follows the Theoretical
Framework in chapter three. The methodology in chapter four presents how the
empirical research was conducted with details of the data collection process and the
sample. The chapter also explains details of how the data was cleansed and
ultimately analysed. Chapter five presents the empirical findings and data analysis
compared to the theoretical framework and empirical data from third-party sources
with discussion of the limitations and possibilities for further research, summarizing
the thesis. Finally, in chapter six, there is a summary of the thesis in Swedish.

8

2. Theoretical Framework
The second chapter of the thesis presents the theoretical framework. The chapter
presents the company’s perspective on innovations and how they are trying to mold
the market to suit their company better, and what market-shaping encompasses. The
chapter then examines the consumers, what affects their behavior, and discusses the
consumer adoption and non-adoption of technologies. The chapter then dives more indepth into why 5G is needed, the predictions for the technology, conspiracy theories,
and legitimate concerns towards 5G.

2.1 Market-shaping
In an environment that is continuously changing, businesses are exploring new ways
to innovate, and ambitious companies view markets as something that they are capable
of shape or mold. Companies are trying to proactively expand their current business
opportunities or create new opportunities by engaging in market-shaping. Marketshaping can be presented by different terms, such as market innovation, market-driving
strategies, and proactive market orientation (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 276). Companies
are increasingly engaging in market-shaping strategies to create new business
opportunities and not only sense and react to different changes in established markets.
The authors mention market formation, market-shaping strategy, niche construction,
and effectuation to shape the markets. The authors would describe adaptive and
dynamic marketing as market information and knowledge capabilities because this
helps gather a deep understanding of the different actors, like customers, channel
members, competitors, and the wider business environment, before these genuinely
reveal themselves (Nenonen et al., 2019, p. 617).
A configurational view focuses on causal complexity, implying that the outcome of a
group of interconnected elements rarely has a single cause (conjunctural causation),
there are various pathways to an outcome (equifinality), and an outcome can be
connected to both the presence and the absence of attributes (asymmetry). Recent
research recognizes markets as systems or ecosystems, suggesting a need to look
beyond sellers’ and buyers’ interactions as part of a more extensive actors system and
unveils that nobody can fully predict or control a market system’s development.
Market systems do not have a central and central control mechanism, nor do they obey
9

simple cause and effect laws. Instead, a mix of deliberately designed influence and
random emergence drives the market to evolve. Market-shaping aims to enhance value
creation and value realization for actors within a market system. The key to new value
is combining resources in innovative ways, such as creating, accessing, deploying,
combining, and exchanging them. Nenonen et al. (2020, p. 277) define market-shaping
as a purposive process by focal firms to:
•

Identifying the value potential of linking intra- and inter-actor resources in new
ways

•

Triggering changes in various market components to enable new resource
linkages.

•

Equip related actors to free up extant resources for new uses.

There is a limited amount of studies that precisely investigate how focal companies
can shape the markets. However, they all acknowledge the value proposition’s
importance. Different studies have conceptualized both value propositions and
markets as configurations of factors that are dependent on each other. Business
disciplines increasingly employ the configurational perspective, which shows the
complexity of the studied phenomenon. The article tries to identify the factors of value
proposition characteristics useful for focal companies that engage in market-shaping
strategies (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 277).

Consequently, the market-shaping value proposition’s role is to explain how focal
companies can provide value by equipping actors to improve resource integration.
There is a limited amount of studies that precisely investigate how focal companies
can shape the markets. However, they all acknowledge the value proposition’s
importance. Different studies have conceptualized both value propositions and
markets as configurations of factors that are dependent on each other. Business
disciplines increasingly employ the configurational perspective, which shows the
complexity of the studied phenomenon. (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 277).
A comprehensive conceptualization of the value proposition concept points out that
resource distribution is not moving in a single direction but involves more profound
two-sided engagement, expected to result in meaningfully cocreated value
propositions. A resource-based view conceptualizes value propositions as signs of
market-based and company-based resources. Market-shaping value propositions’ core
content conveys what kind of enhanced resource integration market actors can expect
when a new market is shaped. Nenonen et al. (2020, p. 277). define a market-shaping
value proposition as a strategic tool enabling new resource integration possibilities by
arranging resource linkages connecting various actors in a market system or equipping
actors to join in new resource integration actions.
The conceptual framework is consistent with recent studies using fuzzy-set qualitative
comparative analysis (fsQCA). It utilizes a Venn diagram approach and a
configurational view to describe the four components of market-shaping value
propositions. The framework builds on the emerging literature on market-shaping and
novel integrative theoretical insights on value propositions. This framework has two
main components. The first one is the core content and design characteristics of the
value proposition identified as potentially connected to market-shaping, and the
second one is market-shaping outcomes. The authors identify two interrelated
overarching consequences of market-shaping on a market system level. These are the
change in market system elements and the overall change of a market system itself.
Authors identify six market elements that may change due to market-shaping and three
crucial forms of the outcome at an overall market system level (Nenonen et al., 2020,
p. 277).

Figure 3. Actor Level to Market System Level (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 279)

In the first outcome, one or more of the six market components may change:
•

products and price

•

customers and use

•

channels

•

supply-side network

•

representations

•

norms

Applying a systemic view of markets implies that market systems are not reducible to
or defined by their components, which means that a change in a market system may
occur due to changes in just one or two components (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 279).
The second outcome is that the overall market systems would change. Successful
market-shaping has system-level consequences. Nenonen et al. (2020, p. 280) are
using three market-level measures to explore the validity of their model empirically:
•

size

•

profitability

•

value creation of the market.

Three forms of outcomes occur at a market system level:
•
•
•

presence of significant economic activity
market system growth
change in the prevailing institutional logics.

2.2 Consumer perspective
Most innovations diffuse at a slow rate, although many would think that promising
innovations would sell themselves. For example, scurvy killed more sailors in long sea
voyages than accidents, warfare, and all other causes of death. James Lancaster
discovered in his experiments in 1601 that lemon juice prevented scurvy. The British
Board of Trade adopted this innovation first in 1865, and scurvy was finally eradicated
from the merchant marine (Rogers, 1995, pp. 7-8). The recent advances in universal
computing have resulted in an unfathomable number of diverse IoT applications for
different environments to improve the end user’s life quality. Devices in an intelligent
home have an Internet connection that helps monitor and control home appliances and
systems. The devices can make autonomous decisions based on sensor information
and improve their end users’ lifestyles (Akpakwu et al., 2018, pp. 3621-3622).
Social psychology’s theories about self-identity represent several perspectives, such
as sociology, psychoanalysis, structuralism, and symbolic interactionism. These
perspectives highlight that self-identity has a social nature. Interactions and relations
with societal institutions, groups, and other individuals shape and influence one’s selfidentity (Wearing & McDonald, 2013, p. 98). Objects have meaning for people
because they act as communicating mechanisms, but these can change over time.
Knowledge about the social history of an object is essential for people involved with
introducing, developing, and consuming new objects, ideas, and services (Szmigin,
2003, p. 30). From a micro perspective, consumer behavior involves understanding
consumers to help a company or organization achieve its goals. From a macro level,
consumer behavior research helps forecast where society is heading and how it affects
living standards because the consumers heavily influence what companies produce and
the resources used (Khan, 2006, p. 5). Marketing and consumer behavior are changing
rapidly, which means that the methods used for studying the behavior need to evolve
(Hawkins & Motherbaugh, 2010, p. 4).
Traditionally, consumers have been defined as purchasers of economic goods and
services and purchasers of products for sale. The new view has broadened up so that
one can be a consumer without any monetary change. Initiators, influencers, users, and
14

buyers are different consumer roles. The initiator determines that there is a need and
then purchases a product to fulfill it. An influencer is someone who, either
intentionally or unintentionally by actions or words, influences the purchase decision.
Usually, one of the parents is acquiring a product or a service for a child. In this case,
the parent who makes the purchase transaction is in the buyer’s role and the child, who
ultimately becomes the consumer, is in a user role (Khan, 2006, p. 4-5).
Consumers may not have many options to choose from when it comes to political
parties or public services such as their hospital, the school for their children, and
libraries they can use. The situation is very different in the daily consumption of food
and goods, with many different grocery store products and brands. In a postmodern
world, the nature of our choices has changed, and the changes will continue happening
during our lifetime (Szmigin, 2003, p. 13).

2.2.1 Affecting consumer behaviour
One response from different companies to fight the excess of choices in the market has
been relationship marketing. Companies engage consumers in long-term partnerships
to learn about their customer base to respond to consumer needs in a mutually
beneficial way. Suppose a group of consumers is positively involved with a company.
In such a case, they are more likely to remain in a relationship with the company and
be ready and more welcoming towards the latest offers, product line extensions, and
other innovations. Trust is the key to positive involvement. When a company has
succeeded in building a customer base, its risk in introducing innovations is mitigated
to some degree, as the customers trust the company will meet their needs. Many
companies undermine customer awareness and trust, which are critical elements of
customer relationships (Szmigin, 2003, p. 13).
Mitigating consumers’ perceived risk towards the products or services and increasing
trust is essential. Cunningham (1967, as cited in Featherman & Pavlou, 2003, p. 454)
identified six perceived risk dimensions: financial, performance, safety, time, social
and psychological loss. Jacoby & Kaplan (1973) theorized that consumers weigh the
overall perceived risk of products after a risk interchange behavior occurred.
Featherman & Pavlov (2003, p. 454) also introduce the privacy risk:
15

•

Privacy risk is the possible loss of control over and misuse of personal
information.

•

Performance risk is the possible malfunction of a product or of not
performing as it was designed.

•

Financial risk is the cost of the product, including the maintenance costs.

•

Time risk is the time consumers may lose by making a wrong purchasing
decision. Consumers would waste time finding information about the product
or service when making the purchase. They would also lose time learning
how to use the product or service in vain.

•

Psychological risk is the risk that the producer’s performance or selection
harms the consumer’s self-perception or peace of mind.

•

Social risk means the status loss in a group due to adopting a product or
service.

•

The overall risk is the general risk perceived by the consumer when all risks
are evaluated together.

•

Physical risk is the perceived safety risk to human health.

Harker and Egan (2006, p. 225) argue that marketers should focus more on their
attention to develop loyalty to their previously and expensively gained customers, not
only on acquiring new customers. Marketing activities and actions need to create value
for customers. Companies often make the mistake of believing that customer value is
in their goods and services delivered to customers in exchange for money. Recent
studies clearly show a trend away from the value-in-exchange view and that customers
are the ones who create value and not companies. Value is created when customers
can use a product to benefit from isolation or co-created in interactions with the
company. No customer value exists until that happens, which means that value does
not emerge in the producer’s space but the customer’s space (Grönroos, 2006, p. 399).
Companies that want a relationship with their customers and expect loyalty should, in
return, be loyal towards the customer (Szmigin, 2003, p. 19).
Customers are those deciding whether a customer relationship exists between them
and a company or not. Only after the customers have decided to have a relationship
can a company start managing it. The type of company, its product types, or the
customer’s situation at a specific moment, affects the customer’s relationship with a
16

company. No research exists to demonstrate when a customer recognizes a relationship
exists and wants a relationship to exist or shift from a purely transactional state to a
relational state. If a company tries to force all its customers into relationships, the
marketing activities will become ineffective, inefficient, and inappropriate (Grönroos,
2006, p. 402).
Through outlets such as television, billboards, the Internet, radio, telephone, direct
mail, newspapers, magazines, buses, marketers bombard advertising messages to
people. A few decades ago, advertisers mainly used TV commercials, billboards,
advertisements in newspapers and magazines, and leaflets as their main outlets. Over
time, advertisers’ pressure to be more creative has meant figuring out new ways of
reaching consumers. Technological innovations are one reason for the bombardment
through various channels. Nevertheless, a fierce competition is the main reason
advertisers have been driven to innovative resourcefulness and why people see
advertisements everywhere. A person sees by estimate between 500 and 3000 adverts
daily. Advertising is very influential, although many consumers try not to pay attention
to it and believe advertisements do not affect them as they do affect others. People
cannot pay attention to and fully process every advert encounter. However, when a
consumer notices and remembers an advertisement, it may increase the demand for
products and services up to 20 times compared to previous demand, although such
significant increases are relatively uncommon (Jansson-Boyd, 2010, pp. 96-97).
Against this background, we present our first hypothesis related to how marketshaping has affected the consumer adoption of 5G in Finland, as follows:
H1a: Consumers’ interest in 5G will be positively related to their awareness of 5Grelated advertisements.

2.2.2 Individual-level characteristics influencing consumer adoption of
innovations
A person’s age, attitude, values, beliefs, perception, self-concept, motivation,
personality, social class, social and cultural background, and other internal and
external factors determine what, how, where, and when they consume (Khan, 2006, p.
4). Marketers spend hundreds of millions of dollars studying consumer behavior and
17

billions of dollars trying to influence when, what, and how people consume precisely.
Consumers are individuals who have different kinds of buying behaviors. A marketer
needs to understand what drives an individual to make a purchase decision. (Hawkins
& Mothersbaugh, 2010, p 4).
Psychologists started to study the causes that lead to decision-making and purchases
decades before marketers. The theory of Maslow’s hierarchy provides information
about why consumer behavior differs so much between people. Abraham Maslow
published a paper in 1943, where he introduced his needs theory, better known as
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. A few modifications have been added to the theory, but
it is still valid today (Kermally, 1999, p. 25). The theory has four basic premises. The
first premise is that every person on earth has similar kinds of biological and
psychological needs. The second premise is that some needs or motives are more
influential than others. The third one is that to move from one motive to another
requires a minimum level of fundamental motivation. Premise number four is that
individuals attempt to satisfy the lower-level needs before the higher-level needs
emerge (Kumra, 2006, p. 62).
There are five types of hierarchically structured needs with different priorities, which
means that an individual’s most substantial need determines his behavior at that
particular time. First on a person’s list is to satisfy his or her basic needs, and when
those are filled, they can start moving up to the secondary needs (Khan, 2006, p. 175).

Figure 4. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Khan, 2006, p. 175)
18

The figure above demonstrates the hierarchical structure of needs. A dangerously
hungry man can think of nothing else than food. A utopia for the man is a place with
plenty of food because he cannot stop thinking and dreaming about it. People in this
situation tend to think that if they only would have enough food for the rest of their
lives, they would be happy and would not ask for anything else, but when a person can
eventually satisfy their basic needs, they will get new needs. (Kermally, 1999, p. 26).
According to Srivastava et al. (2020, p. 246), low-earning people sometimes try to
meet their luxury needs even though their basic needs would not be satisfied. The
research is limited but indicates that people at the bottom of the pyramid, earning $2
to $8 per day and survive with an annual income of $3000 or less, aspire for luxury
goods and desire to use the same products and brands as society’s middle and upper
classes. However, they spend approximately 80% of their income to satisfy their basic
needs.
Motivational forces govern the purchasing process and behavior. A tension is created
in the individual’s mind, which leads them to a goal-oriented behavior to satisfy the
need. Motivation starts with a need and is a driving force, which affects one’s
mentality. The process is continuous because when a specific need is satisfied, a new
need emerges (Khan, 2006, p. 175). In psychology, this is described as possible or
future selves. They are mental representations of what a person either aspire to become
or what they do not want to become. Possible selves serve as information organizers,
but they are also significant motivational influences to help guide a person to grow to
what they aspire to be (Wearing & McDonald, 2013, p. 102). An individual’s selfesteem (evaluation of the self) is partly determined by the individual’s in-group
memberships, which regulate how we feel about ourselves. People favor in-group
attitudes, norms, beliefs, and characteristics over out-groups in their pursuit of selfesteem. The group’s material status does not matter. Both the most privileged and
disadvantaged groups in the community use this internal bias to view themselves
favorably. People from more disadvantaged backgrounds may perceive themselves as
more authentic, grounded, and genuine. Commonly, they view more privileged groups
as superficial and shallow (Wearing & McDonald, 2013, p. 105).
People get exposed to a vast array of information daily, but they recall just a tiny part
of it. People will more likely remember information that is important or something that
is of interest to them. In families, different members are interested in distinct sorts of
19

information that they individually retain. The different personalities, attitudes, and
motives act as information filters. Selective retention means that only relevant
information is kept in our minds while keeping the unnecessary information is kept
out (Khan, 2006, p. 28). Marketers segment consumers by their lifestyle, including
their activities, interests, opinions, and demographics (Khan, 2006, p. 18). The
segmentation can be done with behavioral targeting that follows a consumer’s
behavior on websites and defines their interests. The consumer then gets ads relating
to the interests that have been defined (Washington & Miller, 2009, p.20).
Against this background, we advance to the further hypothesis, as follows:

H1b: Consumers’ exposure to 5G-related advertisements is positively related to their
interest in 5G.

2.3 Consumer behavior and Diffusion of Innovations
Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated
through certain channels over time among the members of a social
system. It is a special type of communication, in that the messages are
concerned with new ideas. communication is a process in which
participants create and share information with one another in order to
reach a mutual understanding.
(Rogers, 1995, p. 6).

Technology is in constant change, simultaneously creating threats to established
business models while offering innovative offers of service. Leading companies often
try to shape technological applications’ development to their benefit. With the
advanced and dynamic growth of technologies, things such as technology availability,
convenience, security, and consumers’ need influence how fast the consumers adopt
these technologies (Lai, 2017, p. 21)

20

The main elements in the Diffusion of Innovations are:
•

Innovation

•

Communication channels

•

time

•

social system

Figure 5. Elements of Diffusion (Rogers, 1995, p. 11)

2.3.1 Conceptualizing consumer adoption of technology
Several theories have proposed to explain consumers’ acceptance of new technologies
and their intention to use them, starting from the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DIT)
by Everett Rogers in 1960 to Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) by Venkatesh
and Bala in 2008 (Lai, 2017, p.22). This study integrates the diffusion of innovation
theory (DIT), the technology acceptance model (TAM), and the model of innovation
resistance (MIR) in examining consumer reactions to 5G market-shaping efforts.
Diffusion of innovation theory more useful when examining specific innovation
characteristics, while TAM acknowledges the fundamental factors affecting the
acceptance of innovation (Min et al., 2019, p. 771).
Fred Davis developed TAM to predict individual adoption and use of new Information
Technologies (IT). It posits that two beliefs determine individuals’ behavioral
21

intention to use IT. The first belief is the perceived usefulness, which the authors
characterize as the extent to which a person thinks that using IT will improve their job
performance. The second belief is the perceived ease of use, which the authors
characterize as the extent to which a person thinks using IT will be effortless. (Davis
& Venkatesh, 1996, p. 20-21). TAM3 is the extension to TAM and TAM2 models and
has been used by various researchers to explain technology adoption (Lai, 2017, p.
22). Venkatesh and Bala developed TAM2 and TAM3 by adding external variables to
explore the effects of external factors on users’ behavioral intention, attitudes, and
actual use of technology. TAM2 concentrated on the determinants of TAM’s perceived
usefulness, while TAM3 concentrated on TAM’s perceived ease of use (Lai, 2017, p.
32). Since 5G is an emerging technology, this thesis will consider the respected TAM
model with its extensions.
Yoon & Kim (2006, p. 102) acknowledge that the concepts of perceived usefulness
and perceived ease of use have been considered significant when determining
consumers’ acceptance and use of IT during the last few decades. However, the authors
claim that new IT acceptance factors may vary depending on the target users, the
technological characteristics, and the context. The statement is based on the
assumption that omnipresent computing technologies give its users convenience
through the intelligence and intercommunication of technologies in our lives’
background. The authors made an extended TAM, including perceived convenience
as a new factor affecting technology acceptance. The study revealed that perceived
convenience is an essential determinant of perceived usefulness, but it did not directly
impact the acceptance of omnipresent computing technologies.
TAM is a widely used theory, but many question its ability to explain the adoption of
different technology types sufficiently. In order to achieve explanatory power and
better understand the fast changes in IT, various studies suggest integrating DIT or
other studies with TAM. DIT helps find adoption patterns and understand adoption
structure, predicting people’s decision-making to adopt an innovation (Min et al.,
2019, p. 771-772). DIT provides different tools to assess a particular technology’s
likely adoption rate and diffusion. There are numerous factors that either facilitate or
hinders the adoption process and implementation of new technologies. These factors
include the technology’s characteristics and, more relevantly, the adopters’
characteristics and how they learn and are persuaded to adopt the technology (Molina22

Morales et al. 2018, p. 65). Min et al. (2019, p. 772) present five innovation attributes
from DIT that affect the adoption:
1. Relative advantages
2. Complexity
3. Compatibility
4. Observability
5. Trialability
Relative advantage is how people consider a specific innovation to be better than what
it replaced and is among the best predictors of innovation adoption. Complexity is the
perceived ease of use or degree of difficulty in understanding the innovation.
Compatibility refers to the innovation being consistent with the potential customers’
needs, existing values, and prior experiences. Observability is how the innovation
results are visible to other potential users, and trialability is the ease with which
customers can try the innovation (Lee et al., 2011, p. 124).
According to Schneir et al. (2019, p. 10), early adopters are usually intensive users and
the least price-sensitive and are the most likely to take unlimited data packages that
mobile network operators (MNO) have started to offer in recent years. Mainstream
users are less intensive users, and they will acquire the service when it grows more
established. Laggards are usually the least intensive users and the most price-sensitive.
The authors assume that when both mainstream and laggards decide to purchase the
service, the subscriptions will not be unlimited but have a capped monthly data
allowance. However, some mainstream users may move towards unlimited packages
depending on MNO charging structures.
Lee (2012, p. 12) investigated factors affecting consumers’ decision-making regarding
smart TVs’ adoption. The results indicated that innovativeness plays an essential role
in affecting the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings also
imply that particular consumer characteristics, such as personality and motivation,
potentially influence consumer opinion concerning innovation characteristics. The
study recommends that companies target high-innovativeness groups when
introducing new technologies (Lee, 2012, p. 17-18).
Dedehayir et al. (2017, p.14) are on the same lines when proposing that businesses
should target consumers with more prior knowledge, possess special technical skills,
23

and a robust social network when launching new products and services. The people
who work in IT fit the description and should be more interested in technology because
they find them more comfortable to use. The innovation can improve their job
performance. Against this background, we advance to the following hypothesis:

H2a: People working in the IT field are more interested in technological innovations.

When looking at the entire workforce in the IT field, the age distribution does not favor
young people because the mean age is 43.1, and the median is 43 years
(Teknologiateollisuus, 2018, p. 2-3). Younger people accept new technology easier
than older people, and the difference is more significant in the short term than in the
long term. The younger generations have started their technology usage relatively
earlier than older generations. The opportunity for older generations to use information
technologies before joining the workplace was limited. (Morris & Venkatesh 2000, p.
392). It would suggest that younger people perceive innovations in information
technology easy to use. Against this background, we advance the following
hypothesis:

H2b: Young people are more interested in technological innovations.

2.3.2 Non-adoption of technology
Lee (2012, p. 13) acknowledges that DIT and TAM present valuable insights on new
technology adoption and recommend various essential conceptual elements that affect
innovation adoption. He adds, however, that studies based solely on these two
theoretical frameworks are often criticized because they have a pro-innovation bias,
assuming all innovations are valuable and should be adopted by everyone. Consumers
tend to resist innovation because it imposes changes for them, and most people do not
want things to change. According to Ram (1987, p. 208-212), it is time to start
respecting individuals who resist change. This type of individual is likely more typical
and rational than a minority of people who seek change for change’s sake and not
24

because of innovations’ fundamental value. The model of innovation resistance (MIR)
is a valuable framework to understand non-adaption and the low rate of diffusion of
specific innovations. MIR conceptualizes the consumer’s psychological tendencies for
innovation resistance (Lee, 2012, p. 13).
Consumers who adopt innovations later than the majority or who have not yet adopted
them are called Laggards, which implies they are behind the times and not on the
innovative, fashionable, and marketable tides. Marketing needs to understand what
makes consumers decide to make a purchase and why they are not making it. There
might be many different reasons people decide not to adopt new technologies and
hastily denounce all consumers who have not adopted the technology as Laggards. It
is essential to examine if time plays a role in the adoption and what consumers indicate
with non-adoption. Marketers should be interested in the consumer’s choice of not
spending their money on new technology at a certain point in time because it is a real
consumption choice (Szmigin, 2003, p.85). Better knowledge of consumer behavior
can help us consume more wisely (Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2010, p. 4).
Innovation resistance is often understood as a determinant that inevitably leads to nonadoption, although it should be seen as another factor in the adoption decision process.
Innovation resistance can be categorized into three parts. The first is rejection, which
means a strong reluctance to adopt an innovation. Merely a lack of awareness or
ignorance is not what drives people who are reluctant towards innovations. The second
category is postponement. It is relevant when consumers choose not to adopt an
innovation at a particular time. In this category, the consumers find the innovation in
question acceptable in principle but decide to wait until circumstances become more
suitable for adoption. The third category is opposition. It is the belief that innovation
is not suitable and can involve consumer strikes against innovation launch (Lee, 2012,
p. 14)
Advertisers want consumers to think that they can find happiness in material goods
and services. Psychological research, on the other hand, seems to indicate the contrary.
The research increasingly suggests that consumers purchase products and services,
hoping that they will substitute for factors that make people truly happy (JanssonBoyd, 2010, p. 172). There are several products available that can cause misery of
some sort to consumers. People still choose to purchase products that can cause misery
25

because consumers often act in non-rational ways. Products such as alcohol, drugs,
and tobacco consumption fall under this category, creating habits that are hard to
control. Consumers can feel misery also when purchasing non-harmful products if they
become too engaged with several different products (Jansson-Boyd, 2010, p. 175).
Extensive consumer research studies are conducted to recognize the likes and dislikes
of a consumer. According to Khan (2006, p. 6), these researches try to determine the
following:
•

What the customers think about a company’s product compared to its
competitors?

•

How would they improve the product?

•

How are they using the product?

•

What does the consumer think about the product and its advertising?

•

How does the customer’s role distribute in the family?

Innovation resistance plays an essential part in the innovation adoption process
because it either directly or indirectly counteracts the positive impact of perceived
usefulness on the intention to use. It is more likely that people will adopt new
technologies if the extent a requirement such as perceived usefulness can be enhanced
exceeds the extent to which innovation resistance urges consumers to reject, postpone,
or oppose adoption and vice versa. The results imply why the integrated model where
has advantages over a single framework. People consider the negative features of
innovations just as they do the positive ones (Lee, 2012, p. 18).

2.4 Conspiracy theories about 5G
Conspiracy theorists retrofitted new information about the coronavirus, its effects on
human health, its origins, and its suitable treatments into their beliefs, worldviews, and
ideologies. Conspiracy theorists have exploited other peoples’ fears of how the virus
could impact them and the people close to them to advance their narratives. Factchecked and reliable information debunking conspiracy theories also circulates, but it
is less consistent, and it circulates in different networks than the conspiracy theorists’
content (Bruns et al., 2020, p. 26). One conspiracy theory falsely claims that 5G
infrastructure waves weaken the human immune system. Other theories argue that the
26

fast spread of Covid-19 in Wuhan is linked to the city’s many 5G towers, although in
reality, the city’s 5G network is in an early phase. In recent months, anti-5G
movements have even arisen in multiple countries. Fake headlines concerning 5G are
spreading quickly on social media and reinforcing the fears of people who were
already suspicious of 5G (Destiny, 2020). Some activists have set cellphone towers on
fire in the Netherlands and Canada, with a couple from Quebec accused of setting at
least two telecommunications towers on fire. In Europe, the fear of building a 5G
network for mobile connections has resulted in the burning of 5G base stations in the
UK, the Netherlands, and Sweden. One reason for the vandalism is the belief that the
base stations contribute to the coronavirus’s spread. In April 2020, a telecom mast was
burned in Pedersöre in Ostrobothnia, but the perpetrators have yet to be caught, so
there is no certainty about their motive (Hirvonen, 2020).
Räikkä and Ritola (2020, pp. 7–8) suggest prohibition, direct fight, and indirect actions
as three approaches to fighting conspiracy theories. The approach of prohibition would
ban false conspiracy theories that have a high chance of leading to seriously harmful
behavior. Critics of this approach argue that applying prohibitions would be
problematic because it is not always apparent which conspiracy theories can be labeled
as untrue and unreasonable. The approach of a direct fight would mean that a nation’s
government actively fights false conspiracy theories without prohibiting their
distribution. This could be done through the cognitive infiltration of radical groups,
where doubts about the theories are planted, undermining believers’ deformed
epistemology and introducing valuable cognitive heterogeneity. The direct fight
approach would evade the intricacies of restricting free speech. The approach of
indirect action would mean that a state uses methods to ensure that people can interpret
the media, think critically, and remain aware of the scientific community’s views by
publicizing them adequately. The state can shed light on diverse views, giving them a
platform and publicity within a civic debate, and thus eliminate the echo chambers of
specific conspiracy theories. Many issues related to conspiracies’ epistemology and
ethics have a political dimension, which might partly explain why people have lately
seemed to lack the will to understand the opposite side of an issue and do not aspire to
sensibly interpret their opponents’ arguments.

27

Although the empirical results indicate that concerns about 5G are low in Finland,
there is still a minority who believe in conspiracy theories about the technology. The
Finnish government could try to fight conspiracy theories using prohibition, direct
fight, or indirect actions, as Ritola and Räikkä (2020, p. 7–8) suggest. The thesis writer
believes that indirect actions would be the most suitable and the least controversial
approach. It would also be essential to understand where the conspiracy theory
believers come from and have public, civic discussions about differing views,
removing the public’s desire for forums that function as conspiracy theory echo
chambers.
In Finland, concerns about the risks of 5G are reflected in online discussions. There is
a lively discussion about the potential dangers of 5G in social media groups, such as
the Stop5G Finland group on Facebook, which has more than 2,000 members.
Telecom operators are responsible for the safety of mobile networks, and the
supervising authority for Finland’s safety matters is the Radiation and Nuclear Safety
Authority (STUK) (Hirvonen, 2020). In a recent interview with Yleisradio (YLE), Pasi
Orreveteläinen, the Laboratory Director of STUK’s Non-Ionizing Radiation
Monitoring Unit, addressed nine claims about 5G. These claims are as follows:
•

There are not enough studies about 5G technology safety.

•

5G base stations are much more radiant than 3G or 4G base stations.

•

The introduction of 5G will increase the amount of radiofrequency radiation
in our environment.

•

5G base stations emit radiation that poses a threat to human health.

•

5G technology is especially harmful to children, the elderly, and pregnant
women.

•

Radiation from 5G base stations weakens resistance and exposes people to,
for example, Covid-19.

•

5G radiation increases the risk of cancer.

•

5G is a threat to nature, including birds and insects.

•

STUK does not have sufficient resources to monitor the health threat posed
by 5G base stations

According to Orreveteläinen, thousands of studies have been conducted on the health
effects of radiofrequency radiation used in mobile phone technologies. Based on
28

current scientific knowledge, all nine of the above claims are baseless. The current
level of safety is high and is the result of years of development. Independent decisionmaking supported by knowledge is how a radiation-safe Finland can be guaranteed
(Hirvonen, 2020).
However, many studies have come to opposing conclusions, and some scientists are
worried about the potential adverse health effects of 5G and an international agenda to
develop this technology. The possible health effects of the rising spread of
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) are still under investigation. The
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), working under the World
Health Organisation (WHO), stated that RF-EMF could be carcinogenic to humans.
Some of the evidence for this is still controversial. More recent studies imply that RFEMF affects the metabolic, reproductive, and neurological systems. There is not much
data on the millimeter waves (MMW) used in 5G cellphone towers. However,
preliminary observations of the MMW indicate several adverse health effects, such as
altered gene expression, changes in skin temperature, and effects on metabolic and
inflammatory processes (Di Caula, 2018, p. 367). According to Kostoff et al., 2020, p.
38-39), a vast amount of data from epidemiological and laboratory studies shows
significant adverse health impacts from every generation of wireless networking
technology. A considerable share of the data was collected under conditions that do
not reflect real-life. Kostoff claims that the adverse health effects become worse when
laying 5G radiation on top of an already profoundly rooted, toxic wireless radiation
environment.
According to Grazier & Sloane (2006, p. 21), single parents are the most risk-averse
regardless of family structure, but women are more risk-averse than men. People of
any sex are more risk-averse if they have children than couples without children.
However, married men are less risk-averse than married women. Weststrate & Glück
(2017, p. 18) suggest that wisdom is correlated with advanced emotional regulation
skills and mental calmness. The authors add that wise people experience less intense
emotions, both positive and negative. People who work in IT and people who know
more than others about 5G are better aware of the limit values for radiation health
effects than other people.

Against the background of the fears associated with 5G technology, which have been
extensively discussed in public discourse but have also been widely debunked, we
advance the following hypotheses regarding the effect of these fears on consumers:
H3a: People with families will be more concerned about the technology’s possible
health effects.
H3b: People who work in IT will be less afraid of the technology’s possible health
effects.
H3c: People who think they know more about 5G than others will be less afraid of the
technology’s possible health effects.
While fear of possible health effects does not necessarily imply an unwillingness to
adopt 5G technology, we do assume a close correlation between these things.

2.5 Consumer adoption of 5G: the current picture
Several companies who led the development of 4G are also developing 5G technology.
The prominent companies in 5G technology include Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, ZTE,
Samsung, Intel, and Qualcomm (Virhiä, 2018, p. 10). Some of these companies build
base stations, and others build chips that help 5G work. Finland has a great deal of
expertise in mobile phone networks, and many companies are involved in the
development of 5G. Nokia is one of the most significant actors when it comes to 5G.
Finnish operators have also taken advantage of and developed the latest technology
quickly (Virhiä, 2018, p. 33).
Nokia, Huawei, and Ericsson are the main actors making 5G network equipment.
Huawei has repeatedly been accused of continuous industrial espionage, and the USA
is investigating the company of fraud and intellectual property theft. There is still no
hard public evidence of significant vulnerabilities in Huawei technology (Kaska et al.,
2019, p. 7-8). Several nations impose restrictions on using Chinese technology in their
domestic infrastructure. However, attitudes in different countries to the increasing
foothold of Chinese technology vary significantly due to differing priorities, differing
digital dependency levels, differing security cultures, and existing capabilities (Kaska
et al., 2019, p. 15). It is not easy to ignore potential Huawei technology vulnerabilities
30

that could be exploited in the future. The potential is there whether the flaws would
happen intentionally or become exploitable due to some failure. It is also a concern
because when digital technology is procured, it often requires a long-term relationship
with a supplier and creates a degree of dependence (Kaska et al., 2019, p. 19).
Maeng et al. (2020, p. 1) have conducted a study suggesting thoughtful diffusion
approaches for 5G services in the Korean market. The Republic of Korea (South
Korea) and Finland have several similarities. They were among the first countries to
launch 5G. The first country to launch the first commercial fifth-generation telecoms
network can be debated. South Korea was the first, or at least among the first countries
to launch 5G (Li & Park, 2019). Several carriers claimed to be the first to launch the
commercial fifth-generation telecoms network, Finnish carrier Elisa being one of them
(Horwitz, 2018). The citizens of both countries are also highly educated and have a
high level of technological competence, which is why we could expect similar patterns
in Finland. One of the most significant differences between the countries is population
density. South Korea is a small country with a large population, while Finland is a
large country with a small population. The population density of South Korea in 2021
is 511.32 people per square kilometer (macrotrends, 2021). The population density of
Finland was 18 per square kilometer in 2020 (Worldometers, 2021). The high
population density of South Korea makes 5G more cost-effective compared to Finland.
According to Maeng et al. (2020, p. 1), as initial users, consumers are essential for 5G
diffusion and the creation of 5G services. Consumers prefer faster internet speed, lower
subscription fees, and large data offers. Consumers mainly postpone adopting 5G
services because of the high subscription cost and lack of need. It is essential to
recognize the potential consumers’ purchase preferences and behavior to integrate 5G
technologies and services successfully. The subscription price was considered the most
influential in terms of relative importance.

(Maeng et al., 2020, p. 1)
31

5G diffusion should increase if the data offer and transmission rate increase during the
subscription price decrease. As for connected vehicles and IoT services, only 31.1%
of respondents who plan to purchase a connected vehicle in the future will do it less
than a year after being launched. The adoption of connected vehicles is mainly
postponed because of the cost burden, distrust, and lack of need. 42.8% are planning
to adopt IoT in less than a year after being launched. Impaired functionality, mediocre
performance, the belief that 5G is irrelevant for IoT devices, and cost burden are the
main reasons why IoT adoption is postponed (Maeng et al. 2020, p. 10). The
development of previous generations usually stops when a new generation of
technology emerges. However, 5G is partly based on enhanced LTE (4G), so the
evolved 4G is likely to be called 5G as a marketing trick even if 4G recaptures
popularity in this transition. The even-numbered generations 2G and 4G have been
more successful than 3G, and many believe that we will have to wait until 6G to see
all of the expectations for 5G fulfilled. 5G will most likely bring in favorable
economics and be at least some kind of success, although operators still have many
concerns. A cross-industry endorsement is a key to make 5G a tremendous success
rather than a moderate success (Onoe, 2018, p. 273-275).
Venture Insights carried out a market survey in late 2018 in New Zealand to better
understand the early adoption of 5G services and how consumers feel about the
evolving mobile market and platforms. One thousand seven respondents across New
Zealand from different age groups participated in the study. The Managing Director of
Venture Insight Nick Pugh (2019, p. 92) wrote a paper concentrating on the survey’s
essential aspects, such as awareness of consumers regarding 5G and race for the early
adopter market, and mobile video and streaming services usage of consumers. 30% of
respondents knew about the 5G network deployment plans, 6% were willing to
upgrade to 5G at launch, and 25% were ready to upgrade within two years from the
launch. 11% were ready to pay more for 5G services, and similar results were obtained
when asked about the willingness to spend more for 5G hardware. The author claims
that their results and strong smartphone usage growth across various applications
confirm that consumers care about technology upgrades and are willing to adopt them.
In some cases, consumers are willing to pay for a more satisfying mobile experience
(Pugh, 2019, p. 94-95).

32

69% of the respondents answered that they had watched videos on their mobile, and
43% regularly watched video streaming services. From the respondents who watched
videos on their mobile phones, 73% answered that they watch more videos now than
they did a year ago. 76% watched videos on their mobile, only when using Wi-Fi. The
top limiting factors of video viewing were the small size of the screen (30%), mobile
data limits (24%), and battery life (17%) (Pugh, 2019, p. 96). The author believes that
video viewing will be essential for consumers to adopt 5G because 73% of the
respondents who were ready to upgrade to 5G within two years of the launch watched
videos on the handset daily, weekly, or monthly. When asked about the crucial factors
when considering the next mobile service purchase, 90% answered price, 81% network
speed, 68% data allowance, 79% network coverage, 30% wanted a service where a
handset is included, and 24% answered that video services are essential (Pugh, 2019,
p. 97-98). The average revenue per user has remained chiefly flat, but there has been
a descending trend in some cases. Within the last year, the average revenue per user
has fallen by 7% in the United States. It will take a long time until we can see the end
of the data growth phase, but some early signs suggest that data usage growth could
be slowing down. BBC lately announced that teenagers were using their phones
slightly less. A similar trend can be seen in many countries, but data growth has lately
been incredibly low in Sweden, Japan, and Singapore (Webb, 2019, p. 7-8).
In recent years, Finns have multiplied their use of data and especially mobile data. The
use of mobile data increased almost 25-fold in 2011–2017. There has been growth in
the use of both consumers and businesses. The growth in data usage has slowed down
since 2017 in Finland. Between 2018 and 2019, data use increased by 20 percent
annually. The use of mobile data and the fixed network grew equally fast (YLE, 2020).
However, the quarantines worldwide because of Covid-19 have increased internet use
to communicate, learn, work, and stay entertained. The use of video streaming
services, videoconferencing and -calls, and video gaming has surged to new highs
(Kang et al., 2020). The pandemic has put many Finns on telecommuting, which has
also been reflected in Telia’s statistics. In the autumn, data use rose to a record level.
According to Sami Siiki, the Director of Telia Infra Networks, traffic in mobile and
fixed network subscriptions grew 30 percent last year. There are several reasons for
growth, such as increased streaming services and video content services. Another
factor explaining the growth is video conferencing services. Siiki estimates that Teams
33

and Zoom will register two to three times the data amount than the previous year
(Puljujärvi, 2021).

Figure 6. Countries with 5G commercial service – June 2020 (Source: IDATE
Digiworld 2020)
In June 2018, Elisa reported that its 5G network provided a 5G phone call between the
Estonian minister of Economy and her Finnish colleague in Finland. The tests revealed
data speeds of 2.2 Gbps. In autumn 2018, the first 5G licenses were made accessible
in the 3.6 GHz band frequencies. In June 2019, Elisa started to offer 5G mobile devices
and subscriptions in Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, and Jyväskylä (European 5G
Observatory, 2020). South Korea launched the world’s first 5G commercial services
in April 2019 (Jahg & Park, 2020, p. 109), so Finland was not far behind. For
consumers, Elisa 5G mobile service offering includes subscriptions with unlimited
data in Finland, or up to 30 GB per month within the EU with data speed options of
300 Mbps (31.90 € / month), 600 Mbps (36.90 € / month), and 1 Gbps (49.90 € /
month). In June 2020, Elisa reported that its 5G network is available in a total of 30
cities and towns across Finland, reaching more than one million people within its
service area (European 5G Observatory, 2020).

34

At the end of 2019, Telia Finland launched its 5G services in seven cities. Besides the
regular mobile subscriptions, Telia Finland also offers Fixed Wireless Access for
homes. The operator offers its 5G subscriptions with unlimited monthly data in
Finland, or up to 25 GB within the EU, varying from 300 Mbps (31.90 € / month) to 1
Gbps (49.90 € / month). In December 2019, DNA launched its “DNA Home 5G”. A
month later, the operator started to sell mobile 5G subscriptions. The operator is
continuously expanding its 5G networks, and currently, they are providing 5G in over
20 cities and towns across Finland. DNA offers its 5G mobile subscriptions with
unlimited data usage in Finland and up to 27 GB within the EU with speeds and prices
ranging from 400 Mbps to 1 Gbps and 34.90 € to 44.90 € per month (European 5G
Observatory, 2020). The 5G network covers at least partly 40 cities in Finland.
There is some contradicting information about the expansion of 5G networks. The
operators believe that a Finland-wide 5G coverage could be possible in 2025.
However, Pasi Karjalainen, a professor of Applied Physics at the University of Eastern
Finland, believes that the 5G network will never cover Finland entirely. Karjalainen
has mapped the possibilities of commercializing 5G in connection with various
projects. Jukka Manner, Professor of Telecommunications and Information Networks
at Aalto University, agrees with Karjalainen and adds that 5G is not a rural technology
because it requires dense base stations to operate a range of one base station is short.
Building expensive base stations in remote areas are not commercially viable for
operators (Remes, 2020). There is about 1,300 kilometers long, and 60 kilometers wide
area from the state border between Finland and Russia to the Finnish side will be left
without the most efficient 5G speed because Russia uses the same frequencies used in
the Finnish 5G network. The International Radio Regulations restrict Finland’s
operations on the same frequencies that Russia needs for its purposes. A United
Nations specialized agency, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),
maintains the Radio Regulations. Finland is negotiating with Russia on the
possibilities of using 5G. However, for now, it seems Lappeenranta, Imatra, Lieksa,
Hamina, Kuusamo, Ilomantsi, and much of Joensuu will not be getting a 5G network
(Kivimäki & Sormunen, 2021).

35

2.6 Summary of conceptual framework
The main characteristics of market-shaping and consumer behavior were discussed in
the literature review, and RQ1 (How consumer adoption of technology is related to
market-shaping?) will be answered using published literature analysis.
Market shaping is about improving a current market or creating an entirely new one.
Random occurrences shape markets, but they can also be shaped and designed
deliberately. Companies try to understand the customers’ wants and needs and,
together with individuals, create, access, deploy, combine, and exchange resources to
create shared value for all stakeholders (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 277). On the market
actor level, the changes of market-shaping efforts can be seen in products and price,
customers and use, channels, supply-side network, representations, and norms
(Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 279). In the example of 5G, the market-shapers are trying to
improve the current market by introducing an enhanced mobile technology. The
technology adoption and non-adoption models help understand what changes actor
level changes are essential for consumer technology adoption. According to TAM, the
fundamental factors of consumer technology adoption are usefulness and
effortlessness when deciding whether or not to adopt a technology (Davis &
Venkatesh, 1996, p. 20-21). According to DIT, a consumer considers a product’s
relative advantages, complexity, compatibility, observability, and trialability (Lee et
al., 2011, p. 124). MIR conceptualizes the consumer’s psychological tendencies for
innovation resistance (Lee, 2012, p. 13). Perceived risks, such as privacy-,
performance-, physical-, and financial risks, can affect technology adoption negatively
(Featherman & Pavlov, 2003, p. 454).

The following figure presents the hypothesis based on the literature review. The
figure also shows “+” or “-“ to indicate the direction of the hypothesized relationship
between the independent and dependent variables. The hypotheses are then
summarized.

3. Methodology
This chapter presents the thesis methodology, starting by presenting the theory of
research design and the trustworthiness of a study. This chapter will also introduce
different research methods and arguments for choosing a quantitative research
method for this study. Moreover, this chapter will present the data sources and how
the data was collected.
Research method means how research is conducted and executed, while research
methodology is all the science and philosophy used in research. The research
methodology allows us to understand the stringent restrictions placed upon our notion
of knowledge. Furthermore, it helps one understand different knowledge-creation
processes. The methodology concepts allow us to face the knowledge that is presented
as fact critically and analytically. One must not accept any research work unquestioned
because being critical of research knowledge will improve the value it has to society
(Adams et al., 2013, p. 5).

3.1 Research design
Quantitative research and Qualitative research are the two main research domains
commonly used in the literature. Quantitative research is based on positivism and neopositivism’s methodological principles and adheres to strict research design standards
developed before the actual research. Quantitative research applies quantitative
measurement, which means that statistical analysis is used. Qualitative research uses
several methodological approaches, such as Hermeneutics, Phenomenology, and
Social Interactionism. Its data collection methods and analysis are non-quantitative,
aiming to examine social relations and describe the respondents’ reality (Adams, 2013,
p. 6). The quantitative research approach emphasizes quantification when collecting
and analyzing the data and involving a deductive approach between research and
theory. It includes the norms and practices of positivism and the natural scientific
principle and represents an external, objective social reality view. (Bryman, 2012, p.
35-36). The qualitative research approach usually emphasizes words instead of
numbers when collecting and analyzing the data. A Qualitative approach mainly
highlights an inductive approach between theory and research and has refused the

38

positivistic and natural scientific norms and practices. It believes that social reality is
continually shifting and emerging from individuals (Bryman, 2012, p. 36).
Both quantitative and qualitative researchers have a great set of criticisms towards
each other. According to Alan Bryman (2012, p. 178-178), the quantitative approach
has received criticism because some consider the social world unfit to be studied
through a natural science model. The phenomenologists who criticize the quantitative
approach believe it ignores the fact that people interpret the world around them.
Objects in the natural sciences (i.e., molecules, atoms, and electrons) do not have a
self-reflection capacity. Some believe that there is an artificial and false sense of
precision and accuracy in the measurement process. The dependence on managing
research tools and procedures to subjects hinders the connection linking research and
daily life. It is hard to interpret how a subject has produced an apparent relationship
between two or more variables. Thus, the analysis creates a static view of social life
independent of people’s lives.
Qualitative research receives critique for being too subjective and impressionistic,
meaning that the qualitative conclusions rely a lot on what the researcher finds
essential and significant. Replication of a study is never a straightforward thing in the
social sciences. However, because there are no standard procedures to follow in the
qualitative approach, it is almost impossible to conduct an authentic replication. In
qualitative research, the populations being observed or interviewed are often small,
making it hard to generalize the findings to other settings. It can be not easy to discover
what the researcher did and how they came to the conclusions (Bryman, 2012, p. 405406).
According to Sukamolson (2010, p. 8-9), quantitative research is particularly suited
to find an answer to the following six types of research questions:
•

When a quantitative answer is sought after, then a qualitative, non-numerical
method does not give a numerical answer that is wanted.

•

If we study a numerical change, it can only be accurately examined using a
quantitative method.

•

When conducting audience segmentation, quantitative research helps estimate
an audience segment's size as a follow-up step to a qualitative study to

39

quantify results obtained in a qualitative study and verify data obtained from
a qualitative study.
•

Quantitative research is often used to quantify opinions, attitudes, and
behaviors and determine how the whole population feels about a particular
issue.

•

A quantitative study suits well when a phenomena need explaining. Several
statistical techniques help predict scores on one variable from scores on one
or more other variables.

•

Quantitative research is excellent for hypothesis testing, to explain whether
there is a relationship between two or more variables.

3.2 Research strategy

Research methods are used to find the best guesses to the researcher’s questions. The
researcher decides what sorts and combinations of research methods serve the study’s
goals best (Adams et al., 2013, p. 6). The model by Saunders et al. (2009, p. 108) does
a great job at demonstrating various research strategies and how they affect the data
gathering and data analysis of research. This thesis starts from the outer layer from the
more broad and working towards the more specific at the center of the research onion.
This thesis uses positivism, deduction, survey, mono method, cross-sectional, and
quantitative approaches.

40

Figure 8. Research Model (Saunders, et al. 2009, p. 108)

A positivistic inquiry provides truth by verifying and replicating observable findings
that concern processes or entities that one can easily perceive. The positivistic view
considers an objective reality. Positivism utilizes factual statements that match
reality’s knowable facts, which means that the truth depends on the correspondence of
theory to facts existing in our visible reality (Clark, 1998,p. 1243). A few simple
assumptions in a good theory can describe an extensive range of events and make
specific testable predictions. Researchers with a positivist stance cannot state their
findings as absolute truth. They can only explain why their model is sound and state
what predictions it makes.
Deductivism uses universal laws as its basis, but the laws are genuinely just hypotheses
that also need testing against the laws themselves’ predictions. The universal laws
persist till one or more of their predictions are proven false, and the theoretical
framework used to create them needs examination. In the deductivist method, the
researcher is working his way from the broad towards the specific. A broad set of
hypotheses correlating to a given phenomenon is narrowed down until the researcher
has a single testable hypothesis or a distinct set of testable hypotheses. Hypotheses
testing requires applying relevant data, which either confirms or does not confirm the
theory’s original arguments (Adams, 2013, p. 10). This thesis uses a deductive
approach to bring together the two main aspects of the 5G market-shaping actions and
the consumer reactions in Finland. The main reasoning for bringing these aspects
together is to find out if the consumer market-shaping actions for this innovation have
been successful or not, and what should be done for consumers to find 5G more
attractive. The deductive process is usually very linear and follows a logical, clear
path. The circumstances can change if a new theory or finding is published during the
writing process or the data does not fit together with the hypotheses. It can also be the
case that only after the data has been collected the relevance of a data set for a theory
becomes apparent (Bryman, 2012, p. 24-25).
Two strategies commonly used for a deductive approach are survey and experiment.
A survey can be either cross-sectional or longitudinal (Sanders et al., 2009, p?).
Surveys enable the collection and standardization of a large amount of data. Data
41

collection through surveys is used a lot in business and management. The survey
method has several approaches to the respondents. Questions can be faced to
individuals face-to-face, on the telephone, or through questionnaires. Surveys can vary
from small-scale populations to large-scale populations. Census means that an entire
population is involved. Answers are appointed to several questions, adaptable to a
more quantitative approach regarding data analysis (Adams, 2013, p. 118). A crosssectional electronic questionnaire survey was chosen in this thesis. A cross-sectional
survey focuses on consumer reactions at a specific time, specifically the early phase
of 5G.
In a cross-sectional study, the data is gathered at a specific time and classified into
more than two categories. Cross-sectional studies help the researcher to find out the
relationship of how specific data affects other specific data. This thesis falls under
cross-sectional design because the responses are collected at a specific time, and the
respondents are classified into different categories (Adams, 2013, p. 69). In this study,
respondents are classified based on different generations and their sex and attitude
towards 5G.

3.3 Data collection
A researcher’s resources are usually insignificant, making sampling a good option
because it is both efficient and effective. When carefully choosing the sample and
analyzing the data, a smaller sample can be generalized reliably to a larger population.
Determining the size of the sample is one of the problems in sampling. The subject is
what determines what kind of a sample is needed. A sample of one can be enough
when the case study is about a family. However, a sample size of thousands of people
might be required to get the needed data in other studies, such as a political telephone
survey, to get the needed data. A sample size usually lies between 30 and 400
participants. Sample size depends on various factors, including the study’s purpose,
the research techniques used, and the population’s size. A sample of 30 will be enough
for a small study because it usually provides results in a normal distribution. However,
the greater the sample size is, the better a population is represented (Guthrie, 2010, p.
53-55).

42

3.4 Sampling
This thesis used an anonymous questionnaire created with Google Forms to collect the
data. The data collection lasted from 28th to 29th December 2020, and during that
period, 194 answers were registered. The thesis writer shared the link to the
questionnaire on Facebook and LinkedIn, and the link was shared a few times by
friends and relatives. Facebook and other social media are used a lot to distribute
questionnaires, and it assists in getting a decent sample size promptly. This approach
can be flawed if only friends and similar-minded people answer the survey. The
respondents may not be representative if they are more or less like-minded (Adams et
al., 2013, p. 130). After answering the questionnaire, the participants could participate
in a draw, where the thesis writer handed out three gift cards worth 20€ each. The gift
cards were intended to attract more people to fill the questionnaire. Approximately
only a third of the questionnaire participants participated in the draw, although it would
have still kept them anonymous. The thesis was anonymous to get truthful answers
from the participants because some of the questions could be considered sensitive.

3.5 Operationalizations
It is essential to operationalizing the applicable theoretical definitions since they have
an elemental impact on the validity of the results. A theoretical and operational concept
definition is needed to conduct a systematic analysis to answer a research question.
The literature review provides the theoretical definitions from legitimate sources. The
operational definitions present how a phenomenon is measured (Esaiasson et al., 2012,
p. 55).
In H1a and H1b, both the independent and dependent variables (Interest in
technological innovations / Coming across commercials about 5G) were measured
with a Likert 5-point scale. In H2a, the independent variable (Work in the IT field) was
a “Yes/No”-question, while the dependent variable (Interest in technological
innovations) was measured with the Likert 5-point scale. The independent variable
(age) in H2b was grouped into 8 categories (18-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, 46-50,
51-55 & 56+). The dependent variable (Interest in technological innovations) was
measured using the Likert 5-point scale. The independent variable (family status) in
H3a was measured by asking how many people live in the respondent’s household (I
43

live alone – 10+). The dependent variable (5G radiation health concerns) in H3a, H3b,
and H3b was measured with a Likert 5-point scale. The independent variable in H3a
(Family status) was a “Yes/No”-question, H3b (Knowledge about 5G compared to
other people who are the same age) was measured with a Likert 5-point scale, and H3c
(Work in the IT field) was a “Yes/No”-question.

3.6 Data analysis
Both descriptive and analytical statistics were used in the statistical analysis.
Microsoft Excel for Office 365 MSO 32-bit and Jamovi 1.6.18 were used in every
statistical analysis in this thesis. The data was extracted from Google forms to
Microsoft excel. In excel, the data was cleansed and processed as a preparation for
the analyses. Excel cannot produce in-depth reports for higher-order regression
models, but it can be used for analyses up to a certain level (Sahay, 2016, p. 3).
Jamovi was used because it is a free and open statistical software, and it can be used
for more complex statistical calculations.
Even though this is quantitative research, and most of the data is also quantitative
and analyzed using statistical methods, qualitative content was also analyzed. The
questionnaire had one optional open question, where the participants could write
about their concerns about 5G. The open question gives valuable, more in-depth data
about the research question.
Descriptive statistics are numbers that provide a summary of the data. It shows
where the middle of the distribution is and how the observations are spread around
that middle. Descriptive statistics help check for errors in data entry and other data
flaws, such as extreme outliers. (Berkman & Reise, p. 5.)
The data were analyzed with correlation analysis and linear multiple regression
analysis to get the correlations between the independent and dependent variables.
Correlation and regression analysis the most widely used tools to investigate the
relationship between two or more variables. Correlation analysis reveals how strong
or weak the relationship (expressed with r) between the two variables is (Sahay,
2016, p. 2). Multiple regression allows a more advanced exploration of the
44

interrelationship within a set of variables compared to correlation. It is one of the
various techniques used to examine the relationship between one continuous,
dependent variable and a set of independent variables. The exploration of the
interrelationship within a set of variables makes Multiple regression an ideal tool for
investigating complex real-life research questions instead of laboratory-based
research questions (Pallant, 2020, p. 153). Multiple regression reveals the degree that
the independent variables explain the dependent variable variance. It also shows the
relative contribution of every independent variable. Tests allow determining the
results’ statistical signiﬁcance concerning both the individual independent variables
and the model itself (Pallant, 2020, p. 158).
Multiple regression can be used to address research questions, such as:
•

How well a set of variables is able to predict a particular outcome.

•

Which variable in a set of variables is the best predictor of an outcome.

•

Whether a predictor variable is still able to predict an outcome when
the effects of another variable are controlled for (e.g. socially desirable
responding).
(Pallant, 2020, p. 154)

The coefficient of determination (expressed with r2) indicates how good the
independent variable is to predict the dependent variable and judges the regression
model’s adequacy. The r2-value is always between 0% and 100% (0 ≤ r2 ≤ 1). The r 2
value indicates the amount of variation in the data explained by the regression model,
and theoretically, an r2-value of 1 (or 100%) would explain all variation in the data.
(Sahay, 2016, p. 36). R2 values are usually lower in fields that attempt to predict
human behavior (r2-values typically < 50%). It is more challenging to predict human
behavior than predict things, such as physical processes. Although the r2-value is
lower in the humanities, the statistically meaningful predictors help draw meaningful
outcomes about how changes in the independent variable values are correlated with
the response value changes. Nevertheless, significant coefficients represent the mean
variation in the response for one unit of change in the independent variable while
holding other independent variables in the model constant (Minitab, 2013).

45

Multicollinearity measures the relationship between the independent variables in a
regression model. When two or more independent variables in a regression model are
correlated, it means that multicollinearity exists. It is common to see correlations
among the independent variables. However, serious multicollinearity may cause
problems because it increases the regression coefficients' variance and makes them
unsteady and difficult to understand. The regression results may be misleading if
multicollinearity is present (Sahay, 2016, p. 114). Variance inflation factor (VIF)
values more significant than ten indicate that multicollinearity excessively influences
the regression results. Multicollinearity can be reduced by excluding insignificant
independent variables from the model. We determine whether multicollinearity exists
by calculating the correlation between every independent variable in the model. The
figure below shows what the thresholds for extreme, moderate, and low
multicollinearity are.

3.7 Ethical considerations
Most people share the opinion that research that is likely to harm participants is
unacceptable. Harm can involve several aspects, such as physical harm, stress, selfesteem loss, harming participants’ development, and provoking participants to conduct
reprehensible acts (Bryman, 2012, p. 135). In many respects, informed consent is the
area within social research ethics that is the most passionately debated. According to
this principle, people should be given enough information to decide whether they want
to join a study. However, the discussion tends to focus on what people varyingly call
either disguised or covert observation. Disguised or covert observation can involve
secretly observing a participant, but it can also mean contrived or straightforward
observation, in which the researcher conceals his or her true identity. Covert
observation disobeys the principle of informed consent because participants cannot
refuse to join (Bryman, 2012, p. 138). The ethical concern of invasion of privacy deals
46

with the degree of invasion that can be approved. Many hold the right to privacy
essential, and it is not acceptable to violate that right in the name of research. Invasion
of privacy and the principle of informed consent are connected. When a participant
gives informed consent based on a thorough comprehension of the causes for their
involvement, they surrender their privacy right concerning the used research method
(Bryman, 2012, p. 142). Deception happens when a researcher represents his or her
work as something that it is not. Researchers in social psychology experiments often
need the participants to respond naturally, and thus they frequently use deception to
limit the participants’ belief of what the research is all about. From an ethical point of
view, deception is not a nice thing to do, and a question of professional self-interest
arises. If many researchers are deceiving people for professional progression, future
researchers might face difficulties in gaining financial support and research
participants (Bryman, 2012, p. 143).
Conducting research using the Internet as a data collection method raises specific
ethical issues. Netiquette is the code of politeness or determinations of acceptable
behavior recognized by online communities and service providers’ acceptable use
policies and data protection laws that governs Internet users’ behavior. Using the
Internet for data collection is multiplying and creating over-researched populations
who suffer from respondent fatigue. All of the researchers using the Internet for data
collection do not follow ethical principles, resulting in suspicion and creating difficult
circumstances for future Internet researchers (Bryman, 2012, p. 679).
The participants’ welfare was considered during the collection and when using the
collected data. Throughout the data collection period, the thesis writer has strived to
provide an accurate reflection of the research subject. The questionnaire itself was
made entirely anonymous to protect the privacy of the participants. Only the e-mail
addresses for those who wanted to participate in the gift card draw were collected, but
the addresses could not be connected to the questionnaire. The researcher informed the
participants about who has access to the data. Participants gave their consent to collect
and analyze the data for the thesis’s designated purpose by participating in the study.

47

3.8 Trustworthiness of the Study
This master’s thesis’s trustworthiness can be divided into reliability and validity.
Primary data was collected for this study because primary data’s validity is more
significant than secondary data. Primary data means that it has been collected directly
from the information source, and it has not been published. Primary data is more
authentic, reliable, and objective than secondary data because it has not been altered
or changed by anyone (Kabir, 2016). Reliability evaluates the measurement’s
consistency. Consistency essentially means that the outcome remains the same when
a tool is used to measure something the same way, with the same subjects, under
similar conditions. A measurement instrument is reliable if something is measured
many times and the result is always the same. Reliability is a necessary precondition
for validity, but reliability is not a sufficient qualification on its own for a valid
measurement instrument. An instrument may be mismeasuring a variable all the time,
but it is reliable as long as the outcome is consistent (Adams, 2013, p. 245).
The researcher thoroughly reviewed and selected literature and the research methods.
The primary data results were carefully organized and analyzed to ensure the study’s
validity. It is essential to mention that this thesis researcher probably knows at least
some of those who participated in the quantitative research from before. There is a
chance that the people who know the researcher might want to help, which could lead
to biased answers. The questionnaire’s link was shared on social media, which might
decrease the reliability because everyone does not use the platform. It is harder for the
more underprivileged society members to participate in the questionnaire. There is a
chance that the participants’ demographics were too similar, although the research
reached a wide array of potential respondents with different backgrounds. It is still
plausible that the results of a reconducted study under the same circumstances would
be consistent with this one.

48

4. Empirical Findings and Data Analysis
This chapter will present and analyze the empirical results from the survey. The
chapter starts by describing the respondents’ demographics and moving to hypotheses
testing and the analysis of the collected data. After that, the validity and reliability of
the results were evaluated. At the end of this chapter, the results of the data analysis
are presented.
The empirical part of this study will answer the second research question, which has
been divided into two parts:
a. What influences consumers’ interest in 5G technology?
b. What explains consumers’ health concerns related to 5G?
The data from following survey questions will help to answer the research question
2a:

Table 2. Descriptive overview of the sample collected

4.2 Data Extraction and Cleansing
Out of the population of 194, seven answers were considered not valid and thus
removed. Six of the seven answers were removed because the participant lived abroad.
One answer from a 20-26-year-old male from Turku was a duplicate and thus removed.
The filled surveys were successively received and had all the same answers, including
the same sentence in the comment section, which would be too big of a coincidence.
The total quantity of the revised population is 187. The two participants who did not
reveal their gender will be included in the sample but will not be considered when
analyzing the two sexes. There was only one participant from each of the age groups
56-60, 66-70, 71-75, and 76-80, and only four participants from the age group 61-65,
which is why these were combined as one group with ages ranging from 56-80. A
large share of the population came from four cities, Helsinki 54 (28.88%), Turku 41
(21.93%), Kokkola 20 (10.70%), and Vaasa 14 (7.49%). Two of the city names were
translated from Swedish to English. The participants were divided into small and big
cities. Tilastokeskus (2021) was used to get information about the Finnish cities’
populations from December 2020. In this thesis, a big city has at least 100 000 citizens
and thus includes the following Finnish cities:
•

Helsinki

(657 674 inhabitants)

•

Espoo

(292 913 inhabitants)

•

Tampere

(241 391 inhabitants)

•

Vantaa

(237 231 inhabitants)

•

Oulu

(207 424 inhabitants)

•

Turku

(194 488 inhabitants)

•

Jyväskylä

(143 485 inhabitants)

•

Kuopio

(120 246 inhabitants)

•

Lahti

(120 039 inhabitants)
51

Participant’s living in any of the other Finnish cities were considered to live in a “small
city.” The line between the big cities and small cities was drawn here, and the biggest
of the small cities where a participant joined was Kouvola with 81 216 citizens.
12 No-answers were removed from the free comment section about additional
concerns regarding 5G because an empty field represents no answer. Questions 3-31
were adjusted from a question to a statement. Question number 4. (How many people
live in your household?) was adjusted to Family. The participants who answered 1 or
2 in question number 4, were considered not to have any children of their own.
However, those who answered something between 3 and 10+ were considered to have
at least one child and be a family. The answers for question number 5. Problems with
internet connectivity were adjusted to Often (= 0) and Seldom (= 1). In this thesis,
Daily and Weekly internet problems are considered Often, while monthly, a few times
a year, and I never have problems with internet connectivity are considered Seldom.
All answers, except 25. Things to improve for higher interest in 5G and 31. Other
concerns regarding 5G were adjusted from a word to a number, as shown below. The
questionnaire was only available in English. Six qualitative answers for the last
question were translated from Finnish to English.

Only one test was needed for the hypotheses H1a and H1b. The result is the same, even
if the independent and dependent variables would change places. Both hypotheses
were made because we wanted to show that exposure to many advertisements can
influence a consumer’s interest in technology, but also the consumer’s interest in
technology can influence how many adverts they encounter.
Linear regression was used to answer the hypotheses H1a and H1b. The results show
a correlation (R) of 0.28 and R2 of 0.08 for both H1a and H1b. There is a correlation
between the two variables, but it is not significant and does not entirely explain the
model. The p-value is smaller than 0.001 in H1a. If the unit of Interest in technology is
increased by 1, there will be an increase of 0.45 in the coefficient Coming across
commercials about 5G. The significance of H1b is also high because the coefficient
0.17 comes with a p-value smaller than 0.001. These values are in line with the
literature, which is why we fail to reject the hypotheses.

There might be several reasons for this. Potential reasons are that the respondents who
wanted to participate in the questionnaire found the subject interesting. The survey
was also distributed on social media, and the data collection lasted only one day.
According to Tilastokeskus (2019), internet use starts to decrease from the age group
45-54 upwards, which increases the chance that an older participant is also more
interested in technology or social media than the mean of their age group. The online
data collection method to collect the data through social media can be flawed if only
friends and similar-minded people answer the survey (Adams et al., 2013, p. 130). It
could have caused why the data in this thesis does not follow the same pattern as in
the general population.

Linear regression was used to conduct the hypotheses test for 3a, 3b, and 3c because
all three hypotheses have the same dependent variable. 5G radiation concerns have
weak negative correlations with knowledge about 5G (R = -0.23 and p-value = 0.002)
and work in the IT field (R= -0.28 & p-value < 0.001) but not with the family status
(R= 0.08 & p-value= 0.26). Hypothesis 3a was rejected, but the H3b and H3c are
accepted. The linear multiple regression model shows that the model improves when
the covariates Work in the IT field and Knowledge about 5G compared to other people
the same age are put together, but the second coefficient is not significant because the
two coefficients are correlated with each other. We will consider the variable
Knowledge about 5G compared to other people the same age redundant and remove
it. Instead, we looked at how gender affected 5G radiation concerns because the
literature suggested that females are more risk-averse than men, and our correlation
matrix-supported this claim. We tested only males and females and found a significant
positive correlation with 5G radiation concerns and Gender (R= 0.29 & p-value = <
0.001). Gender was also negatively related to the Knowledge about 5G compared to
other people the same age. Gender was added in the linear multiple regression, and it
improved the model. The covariates Work in the IT field and Gender are together more
correlated to 5G radiation concerns (R = 0.37, R2 = 0.14 & p-value < 0.001).

Change in interest in 5G over time had the highest correlation with 5G has been a
success thus far. The two questions are pretty similar, so it is not surprising that those
are highly correlated. It still offers valuable information to the RQ2a, and it is plausible
that people who view the technology as a success are also more interested in it. The
moderate correlation with The importance of a fast-speed Internet connection is not
surprising either because a fast Internet connection is one of 5G’s essential missions.
67

The interest of and knowledge about 5G were also positively correlated. The concerns
about the technology affect the interest negatively. These will be discussed more in the
analysis of research question 2b.

to get consumers more interested in 5G. Cheaper subscriptions with 80 (44.2 %) votes
were seen as the second most impactful factor to increase the technology's interest.
New applications that require 5G to work came third with 48 votes (26.5%), and only
45 (24.9%) participants thought a better battery-life for the mobile devices would make
them more interested. 24 (13.3 %) participants did not think any of these would make
them more interested in 5G. Six answers were excluded because of no knowledge of

Out of 25 people who own a 5G mobile device and a 5G subscription, 17 (68.0%)
participants think a more extensive network coverage would make them more
interested. New applications that require 5G to work came second with 7 (28.0%)
votes. Cheaper subscriptions and Battery life for mobile devices shared the last place
with 6 (24.0%) votes each. A much smaller share of the participants who already use
5G does not think the subscriptions are too expensive, and the share of those who
would want it to be cheaper fell from 44% to 24%.

Figure 23 – RQ2b - Gender differences
Females are more concerned about 5G compared to males. The empirical data would
indicate that it has to do with women having a lesser interest in technological
innovations. However, the literature suggests it has something to do with women being
73

more risk-averse than men. It is plausible that several other factors also influence these
results. This thesis will not further elaborate on the causes of differences in
technological interest between genders.

4.6 Qualitative insights
Although this thesis uses a quantitative research method to study consumer reactions
towards 5G in Finland, the study participants were given the possibility to add a
comment about other concerns about the technology in an optional text field at the
end of the survey. After excluding the 12 “no/nope”-answers, 26 participants out of
all 187 chose to write valuable comments. The comments touched upon several
themes.
Seven central themes were identified from the qualitative comments:
1. Coverage concerns
2. Costs of 5G (roll-out and subscriptions)
3. Privacy concerns
4. Performance concerns
5. Concerns towards people who do not understand the technology
6. Consumer 5G is a useless technology
7. Health concerns
Six of the participants mentioned that the 5G coverage is an issue. There were doubts
about 5G replacing WiFi because the 5G signals are poor at penetrating objects
between the base station and a 5G device.
Teleoperators have been talking about 5G for such a long time without even
having a product or solution to sell. This has diluted the population’s belief
towards the concept. The roll-out has been super slow and favors major
cities. This will cause a division between rural and urban folks. Idiotic
conspiracies have an outstanding impact on generating fears about the
technology, as the technology companies themselves are very bad at
explaining how the networks operate and that they’re safe. MAKE IT
SIMPLE, MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE.

74

Five of the participants were concerned about the costs of the 5G roll-out and how it
affects the subscription prices. Some believe the subscriptions will become cheaper
once the technology becomes mainstream.
It requires huge investments from ISP’s (Internet service providers) to their
network to provide people 5G effectively. The money has to come from
somewhere... Lay-offs? Consumers might not need it just yet, but it is good
to offer 5G to businesses as it might drop costs compared to fiber
connections. Also, are the ISP’s too pressured or worried about providing
the connections, and it might impact how well they are backed up? E.g., if a
crucial node goes down, are there enough backup devices? (Using 4g
instead of 5g in case of possible problems).

Four participants who commented on the last question had some privacy concerns
about the 5G technology, such as information leaks and the large companies knowing
their location and gathering information about their behavior. The Chinese
multinational technology company Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd was mentioned as
an example.
I’ve read about contradicting opinions on the matter. These regard
radiation from 5G, which I’ve read may affect our health, but I haven’t dug
deeper on the matter. I also have a feeling large companies have a better
possibility to watch us and the” big brother” syndrome will grow even
bigger. Personally, I do not think 5G is necessary in my own life, but I’ve
understood it will help mostly industries and factories. My opinion on 5G is
not at least on the positive side.

Performance concerns and concerns towards people who do not understand the
technology both received three comments. Three participants also wrote that the
technology is still basically useless. The comments about performance concerns and
the comments about the technology being useless for consumers were partially
overlapping.
Performance:
75

We still miss standalone networks & lower latency and faster upload speeds.
Currently 5G is just bit better than 4G and coverage is quite poor.

Useless technology:
In my opinion it’s part of the tech-utopian narrative and besides being a
valid technology, it lacks actually useful applications for the good of
humanity.

People who do not understand the technology:
I’m concerned about what people do when they believe different kinds of
stories about 5G being harmful. People have no idea what kind of
frequencies consumer-used 5G uses (compared to WiFi or Bluetooth) yet
still burn down 5G transmitters.

Two participants wrote about their health concerns about 5G. One participant stood
out with her comment, indicating that she has read some alternative facts about 5G.
5G will cause increased health problems, e.g., cancers and infertility. It will
also destroy nature and its animals. The 5G project should be suspended
immediately.

76

5. Conclusions
The previous chapter results are interpreted, and a general conclusion is formed in
this chapter, followed by a discussion including the opportunities and challenges of
5G in Finland. The theoretical and practical implications are then presented, and the
chapter concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the thesis and suggestions for
further research.

5.1 General Conclusion
This section reviews the research questions and their answers and then uses this insight
to explain how the thesis’s aim has been fulfilled.
The existing literature was used to answer research question 1: How is consumer
adoption of technology related to market shaping?
Market shaping is intended to improve a current market or create an entirely new one.
Random occurrences shape markets, but markets can also be shaped and designed
deliberately. Companies try to understand their customers’ wants and needs to create,
access, deploy, combine, and exchange resources to create shared value for all
stakeholders (Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 277). On the market actor level, changes in
market-shaping efforts can be seen in products and prices, customers and product use,
channels, supply-side networks, and representations and norms in the society
(Nenonen et al., 2020, p. 279). In the case of 5G, market-shapers are trying to improve
the current market by introducing enhanced mobile technology. Technology adoption
and non-adoption models help understand what actor-level changes are essential for
consumer technology adoption. According to TAM, the fundamental factors of
consumer technology adoption are the perceived usefulness and effortlessness of use
(Davis & Venkatesh, 1996, pp. 20–21). According to DIT, a consumer considers a
product’s relative advantages, complexity, compatibility, observability, and trialability
(Lee et al., 2011, p. 124). MIR conceptualizes the consumer’s psychological
tendencies for innovation resistance (Lee, 2012, p. 13). Perceived risks, such as
privacy risks, performance risks, physical risks, and financial risks, can negatively
affect technology adoption (Featherman & Pavlov, 2003, p. 454).

77

The analysis of the empirical data for research question 2a (What influences
consumers’ interest in 5G technology?) resulted in various findings, some of which
are exciting and unexpected. First, the data show that the way a consumer views the
technology affects their interest in it. Also, a consumer’s need for a high-speed Internet
connection significantly influences consumers’ interest in the technology.
Surprisingly, low latency, which is another essential feature of the technology, was
barely correlated with interest in 5G. Low latency may become a more significant
factor when other technologies that require low latency, such as autonomous driving,
become more prevalent. Interest in technological innovations and knowledge about 5G
were also positively correlated with the 5G interest. This correlation would be in line
with Dedehayir et al.’s proposition that businesses should target consumers with more
prior knowledge, special technical skills, and a robust social network when launching
new products and services (2017, p.14). Another noteworthy finding is that there was
no correlation between age and interest in technological innovations or 5G. This
finding contradicts the common belief that younger consumers would be more
interested. Several concerns were negatively correlated with interest in 5G. A minority
of the participants of this study are sincerely concerned about several matters,
including conspiracy theories that 5G reduces the human body’s resistance against
Covid-19. We dug deeper into the concerns included in research question 2b: What
explains consumers’ health concerns related to 5G?
In the multiple-choice question of this study, almost 60% of the participants thought
they would be more interested in 5G if the network coverage were more extensive,
followed by 45% if they had access to less expensive subscriptions. Other less
important aspects were the existence of innovative applications that require 5G to work
(26.5%) and better battery life for mobile devices (24.9%). Of the participants, 13.3%
did not think any of these changes would make them more interested in 5G. This
distribution is similar to that of people who already have experience with 5G, except
for the incentives of less expensive subscriptions and more extensive network
coverage. The most significant change by far was the more extensive network
coverage, with 68% of participants choosing this option. Other less important factors
were the development of new applications that require 5G (28.0%). Less expensive
subscriptions and battery life for mobile devices were seen as the least important
factors (24.0% each). Participants who already use 5G are less price-sensitive than
78

those who have not adopted the technology, with the share of those wanting the
technology to be less expensive falling from 44% to 24%. This finding is in line with
Schneir et al.’s proposition that early adopters are intensive users who are the least
price-sensitive and the most likely to use the unlimited data packages that mobile
network operators (MNO) have started to offer in recent years (2019, p. 10).
Our analysis of RQ2b suggests that the most significant correlations with 5G health
concerns were environmental concerns and information leak concerns. The concern
with the 5G radiation affecting birds’ or insects’ sense of direction was significantly
correlated with health concerns. Sufficient real-life studies about the effects of
radiation on the environment are still limited in this early stage. The long-term
environmental effects of 5G, as a novel technology, are still unknown. However, we
know that the technology will have at least some adverse environmental impacts
because of the plenitude of new devices and new infrastructure required and the
extensive amount of energy required to support and maintain the development. Various
recent studies have suggested that consumers are becoming more conscious about the
environment and pushing for sustainable solutions, so 5G might not fit this vision well.
This study has shown that information leaks related to 5G are a valid concern due to
the abnormal increase in services and devices. Security solutions are needed for the
various threats and vulnerabilities brought by the new technology. Surprisingly, the
perception that 5G reduces the human body’s resistance to Covid-19 was only
moderately correlated with health concerns. This is purely a conspiracy theorist’s
proposition with no scientific proof, but the empirical data of this study confirms the
existence of a minority in Finland who believe it. Women were more concerned about
the technology’s health effects, supporting Grazier’s & Sloane’s proposition that
women are more risk-averse than men (2006, p. 21).
The factors negatively correlated with 5G health concerns were interest in
technological innovations, regarding high-speed Internet connection as important,
change in interest in 5G over time, work in the field of IT, playing video games, and
knowledge about the technology. It can be presumed that consumers who know more
about 5G technology score higher in the variables mentioned above due to their
perceived usefulness of 5G, which is in line with Lee’s studies on the factors affecting
79

consumers’ decision-making regarding the adoption of smart TVs (2012, p. 12). The
results indicate that a person’s attitude toward innovations plays an essential role in
affecting the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of a new product.
RQ3: Given consumers’ attitudes to 5G, how should actors shape the 5G market?
Several actors are shaping 5G markets, including Ericsson, Nokia, and Huawei, the
leading companies producing 5G network equipment, such as base stations. These
three companies (and others with a smaller market share) are trying to win deals with
operators worldwide. Some operators can freely choose which equipment supplier to
use, but Chinese suppliers, such as Huawei, are prohibited in many countries. Huawei
and the Chinese government could be a part of the reason for information leak
concerns. Governments may be trying to decrease this perceived risk by imposing
restrictions on the use of Chinese technology in their domestic infrastructure. Several
other significant actors are shaping the market, such as companies building chips that
help 5G work, content creators, and device manufacturers. The literature identified
seven perceived risk dimensions that might affect technology adoption: financial,
performance, safety, time, social, and psychological loss (Cunningham, 1967, as cited
in Featherman & Pavlou, 2003, p. 454), as well as privacy risk (Featherman & Pavlov,
2003, p. 454). The empirical data from this thesis indicate that consumers perceive
several risks of these risks with 5G, including privacy, financial, performance, and
physical risks. Market actors must mitigate these risks to increase trust in 5G products
and services.
The empirical results of this thesis indicate that more extensive network coverage is
the most critical factor for consumers who have not yet adopted the technology and
that it is even more important to consumers who have already adopted the technology.
Finland needs an extensive 5G network for the technology to reach its full potential.
However, it is costly to do so in a relatively large country by area with a small and
dispersed population. The price of a 5G subscription is the second most crucial factor
for those who have yet to adopt the technology, which might be troublesome for
operators trying to get returns on their huge investments in 5G. The existence of new
applications that require 5G to work and better battery life for 5G devices were also
important factors for consumers who had already adopted and those who had yet to
adopt the technology.
80

5.2 Managerial implications
Some recommendations and managerial implications can be formed based on an
evaluation of previous research results and the empirical findings of this study. The
results may not be statistically generalizable to the entire Finnish population. However,
the sample population of 187 provides extensive insight into the experiences and
opinions of the early stages of 5G in Finland. There was no correlation between the
participants’ age and their interest in technological innovations or 5G in particular.
This finding is exciting and noteworthy because it implies that older consumers can be
very interested in technology and thus should not be overlooked by companies trying
to engage in market shaping.
5G is a breakthrough that could unleash various disruptions within the massive 5G IoT
ecosystem. 5G could transform nearly every industry imaginable. The benefits for
consumers include improved video live streaming, augmented reality, autonomous
cars, and gaming experience, to name a few. Still, in the eyes of many, 5G has been
simply an additional feature on flagship mobile devices thus far. Trying to justify
higher prices to consumers today for the potential future benefits of this technology is
challenging. Consumers will most likely pay less for both devices and subscriptions in
the future when 5G supported services and applications are a reality. It seems that
actors are moving in the right direction because the 5G phones are getting less
expensive, coverage is getting better, and speeds are expected to get faster.
Prohibition, direct fight, and indirect actions are three approaches suggested to fight
conspiracy theories about 5G. Indirect actions mean that a state would ensure that
people can interpret media and think critically and that the scientific community’s
views get enough publicity (Räikkä & Ritola, 2020, pp. 7–8). 5G actors could engage
governments, and together, they could build a scientific platform on which people with
diverse views can have public debates, thus reducing the appeal of conspiracy theory
echo chambers online.

5.3 Limitations
The results of the study have certain limitations that need to be addressed. The
population of the study is too small to be credibly generalized to the entire Finnish
81

society. The snowball sampling method is not optimal because at least some
participants do not represent a random sample, which may produce biased results. The
participants’ geographic scope could have been greater because nearly 70% of the
participants lived in four Finnish cities. Most of the participants were 18 to 55 years
old, and only seven of the participants were between 56 and 80 years old, which is not
enough to enable credible generalization. With the limited amount of time available
for the sampling process, the results could also have been affected by society’s
operations, such as the Christmas holidays during the sampling period. Finally, the
quantitative statistical models used in this research determine only correlation and do
not consider causation.

5.4 Suggestions for further Research
Due to time constraints, we could not obtain accurate data on long-term consumer
reactions to 5G market shaping. We did ask how consumers’ views of 5G today
compare to their views when they first heard about the technology. 5G is still in its
early stages, and the roll-out will continue for years to come, so it would be interesting
to measure participants’ opinions at a later date. Another consideration for future
research is narrowing down the age groups’ spread or studying only consumers in
specific age groups.
The qualitative insights of this study provided valuable and interesting data, but the
information and knowledge that can be extracted from that data are still minimal, so
qualitative research into a similar theme would be interesting to read. This thesis
covered only the consumer perspective. 5G can transform several industries, so it
would be valuable to study how companies have adopted the technology and what kind
of impact they believe it will have. Because this thesis studied the consumer
perspective, and because 5G is in the early stages, only the mobile communication
sphere of operation was considered. Future research could concentrate on 5G’s effect
on the efficiency of IoT and cloud services.

6. Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Konsumenternas reaktioner på marknadsutformning
- en fallstudie av de tidiga skeden av 5G-mobilnätstjänster i Finland
Introduktion
Den omfattande användningen av datakrävande mobila enheter har kraftigt ökat
datatrafiken och inspirerat forskarna att utveckla 5G-nätverksdesign som stöder flera
Gbps-hastigheter för att hålla med den ökande efterfrågan på data. 5G erbjuder snabb
uppkoppling med låg latens (Anasia D’mello, 2019). 5G har redan fått mycket
publicitet i flera år, och över tiden tror många att teknologin är en banbrytare som
kommer att förändra människors liv och hur man använder sakernas internet. Det finns
ändå några tecken på minskad entusiasm gentemot 5G hos en del av konsumenter.

Syfte och forskningsfrågor
Avhandlingen är en fallstudie som studerar konsumenternas reaktioner på 5Gmarknadsutformning i Finland i detta tidiga skede. Finska operatörer var bland de
första i världen som introducerade en kommersiell 5G-uppkoppling för sina kunder.
Syftet med avhandlingen är att ge en djupare förståelse av hur finska konsumenter
uppfattar 5G och hurudana skäl till oro de känner gentemot teknologin. Avhandlingen
ger viktig information för olika 5G-aktörer hur 5G-kommunikation tas emot och
hurudan kommunikation de borde satsa på för att förhöja adopteringsgraden för
teknologin,

samt

minska

oron

gentemot

5G.

Tillverkare

av

tele-

kommunikationsutrustning, operatörer och den finska staten är exempel på
organisationer som kan ha nytta av denna slutarbeten. Jag har identifierat tre
forskningsfrågor med utgångspunkt i syftet som besvaras genom denna avhandling:
•

Forskningsfråga 1: Hur är konsumenternas adoption av teknik relaterad till
marknadsutformningen?

•

Forskningsfråga 2a: Vad påverkar konsumenternas intresse för 5G-teknik i
Finland?

83

•

Forskningsfråga 2b: Vad förklarar konsumenternas hälsorelaterade oro för 5G
i Finland?

•

Forskningsfråga 3: Med tanke på konsumenternas attityder till 5G, hur borde
5G-aktörerna utforma 5G-marknaden i Finland?

Teoretisk referensram och hypoteser
Med hjälp av olika teorier och tidigare studier i teoretiska referensramen, formulerades
hypoteser som beskriver hurudana resultat som kan förväntas av denna vetenskapliga
undersökning. Enligt Jansson-Boyd (2010, s. 96-97) är annonsering mycket
inflytelserik, även om man försöker ignorera den. Konsumenter kan inte observera
eller tillägna sig alla reklammöten, men när de anammar en annons, kan det höja
efterfrågan på produkter och tjänster upp till 20 gånger.
Mot denna bakgrund presenteras den första hypotesen om hur marknadsutformning
har påverkat konsumentintroduktionen av 5G i Finland enligt följande:
H1a: Konsumenternas adoption av 5G kommer att vara positivt relaterad till deras
medvetenhet om 5G-relaterade annonser.
Individernas olika personligheter, attityder och motiv filtrerar viss information. Endast
information som är relevant för oss anammar vi, medan den onödiga informationen
filtreras (Khan, 2006, s. 28). Detta leder vidare till nästa hypotes:
H1b: Konsumenternas intresse för teknik är positivt relaterat till deras medvetenhet
om 5G-relaterade annonser.
Enligt Dedehayir et al. (2017, s.14) gynnas företag av att koncentrera sig på
konsumenter med förkunskaper, speciella tekniska färdigheter och ett robust socialt
nätverk när de lanserar nya produkter och tjänster. Människor som arbetar inom it
passar beskrivningen eftersom de är bekvämare med att använda tekniska innovationer
som även kan förbättra deras jobbprestanda. Mot denna bakgrund följer nästa hypotes:
H2a: Människor som arbetar inom it-området är mer intresserade av tekniska
innovationer.

84

Yngre människor accepterar ny teknik lättare jämfört med äldre människor, och
skillnaden är mer betydelsefull på kort sikt än på lång sikt (Morris & Venkatesh 2000,
p. 392). Följande hypotes bygger på detta:
H2b: Ungdomar är mer intresserade av tekniska innovationer.
Mot bakgrund av den oro som är förknippad med 5G-tekniken, och som i stor
utsträckning diskuterats i den offentliga diskussionen (även om en stor del har blivit
avslöjat som myter), följer tre hypoteser om dess effekt på konsumenter:
H3a: Människor med familjer känner mera oro över teknikens möjliga negativa
hälsoeffekter.
H3b: Människor som arbetar inom it känner mindre oro över teknikens möjliga
negativa hälsoeffekter
H3c: Människor som vet mera om 5G känner mindre oro för teknikens möjliga
negativa hälsoeffekter.

Metod, datainsamling och analys av data
Eftersom

avhandlingen

undersöker

konsumenters

uppfattningar

om

5G-

marknadsutformning i Finland valdes en kvantitativ forskningsmetod. Denna
avhandling faller under tvärsnittsdesign eftersom svaren samlades in vid en viss
tidpunkt och respondenterna klassificerades i olika kategorier (Adams, 2013, s.69). I
denna studie klassificerades respondenterna baserat på olika generationer och deras
kön och attityd gentemot 5G. Litteraturen och forskningsmetoder granskades grundligt
innan urvalet. De primära dataresultaten organiserades noggrant och analyserades för
att säkerställa studiens giltighet. Datainsamlingen gjordes genom ett anonymt
frågeformulär som skapades med Google Forms för att samla in data. Frågeformuläret
var anonymt för att deltagarna inte skulle vara rädda att svara sanningsenligt, eftersom
vissa av frågorna kunde betraktas som känsliga. Microsoft Excel för Office 365 MSO
32-bit och Jamovi 1.6.18 användes i varje statistisk analys i denna avhandling.
Uppgifterna extraherades från Google-formuläret till Microsoft Excel. I Excel
rensades och bearbetades data som en förberedelse för analyserna. Totalt deltog 194
respondenter i studien. Svaren av 7 respondenter utelämnades på grund av att de var
ogiltiga. Av de 7 respondenternas svar togs 6 bort eftersom deltagaren bodde
85

utomlands och den sista svar var en kopia och den togs därmed bort. Det totala
bearbetade samplet var 187. De två deltagarna som inte avslöjade sitt kön ingår i
samplet, men kommer inte att beaktas när de två könen analyseras. Hypoteserna 2b
och 3a avvisades, medan de andra hypoteserna passade antagandena och var godkända.
Resultat
Analysen av forskningsfråga 2a antyder att företagen använder marknadsutformning
för att påverka marknadsutvecklingen och för att orsaka en beteendeförändring hos
konsumenterna genom att ifrågasätta deras föreställningar. Inom 5G-området försöker
företagen förbättra den nuvarande marknaden genom att utveckla en förbättrad teknik.
Syftet är att skapa en marknad för tekniken och få potentiella kunder att använda
tekniken. En framgångsrik marknadsutformningsstrategi leder till en högre
adoptionsgrad av teknik hos konsumenterna, vilket är hur de två termerna är relaterade.
Analysen av forskningsfråga 2b antyder att de viktigaste korrelationerna med
hälsoeffekter av 5G-mikrovågsstrålning är teknologins miljöeffekter och oron över
informationssäkerheten. Oron över 5G-mikrovågstrålningens hot mot insekter och
fåglar korrelerade signifikant med den potentiella negativa hälsoeffekten. Studier om
hälsoeffekterna är begränsade i detta tidiga skede och de långsiktiga miljöeffekterna
är okända. Tekniken kommer definitivt ha viss negativ miljöpåverkan på grund av
produktionen av de enorma antalet nya enheter och den omfattande mängd energi som
krävs för att stödja och upprätthålla utvecklingen.
Forskningsfråga 3: Hur borde 5G-aktörerna forma 5G-marknaden med tanke på
konsumenternas attityder till 5G? Flera aktörer formar 5G-marknaderna. Ericsson,
Nokia och Huawei är de dominerande företagen inom produktion av 5Gnätverksutrustning. Dessa tre företag (och andra företag med en mindre
marknadsandel) försöker vinna över affärer med operatörer över hela världen. Vissa
operatörer kan fritt välja vilken utrustningsleverantör de vill använda, medan i många
länder är Huawei och andra en kinesiska leverantörer förbjudna.
De empiriska resultaten indikerar att ett omfattande mobilnätverk är den viktigaste
faktorn för konsumenter som inte ännu tagit i bruk 5G och är ännu viktigare för
konsumenter som redan tillägnat sig teknologin. Man borde utveckla ett omfattande
5G-nätverk, även om det är dyrt att bygga 5G i Finland, som är ett relativt stort land
med en liten och decentraliserad befolkning. Priset på ett 5G-abonnemang är den näst
86

viktigaste faktorn för dem som ännu inte använder teknologin, vilket kan vara
besvärligt för operatörerna som försöker få in avkastning på deras stora investeringar
i 5G. Nya applikationer som skulle kräva 5G för att fungera och en bättre batteritid
(hur länge en enhet fungerar innan den måste laddas) för 5G-enheter var också viktiga
faktorer för alla konsumenter.
Diskussion och avslutning
5G är ett tekniskt genombrott som kan möjliggöra en stor mängd av omstörtande
innovationer inom det enorma ekosystemet av sakernas internet och omvandla nästan
alla tänkbara branscher. Konsumenternas upplevelser t.ex. av direktsändningar,
förstärkt verklighet, autonoma bilar och spelupplevelse kan nå en ny nivå. Många har
hittills ändå inte upplevt 5G som något annat än en ytterligare egenskap på
mobiltelefonernas flaggskeppsmodeller. Det är svårt att motivera varför konsumenter
borde betala extra för en teknik idag för potentiella framtida fördelar. Både mobila
enheter och abonnemangen kommer troligtvis vara billigare i framtiden när flera
tjänster och applikationer som konsumenter vill använda bara fungerar med 5Gtekniken. Riktningen är ändå rätt eftersom 5G-telefonerna hela tiden blir billigare,
operatörerna satsar mycket på att utöka 5G-mobilnätets täckning och mobilnätets
hastigheter blir snabbare.
Förbud, direkta och indirekta motåtgärder är tre metoder som föreslås för att bekämpa
konspirationsteorier. Indirekta åtgärder innebär att en stat använder metoder för att
säkerställa att människor kan tolka media, tänka kritiskt och att vetenskapssamhällets
åsikter får tillräckligt med publicitet (Räikkä & Ritola, 2020, s. 7-8). 5G-aktörerna
kunde försöka engagera sig och arbeta tillsammans med staten. Tillsammans kunde de
bygga en vetenskaplig plattform där människor med olika åsikter kan ha offentliga
debatter och därmed ersätta ekokamrarna i sociala medier som sprider
konspirationsteorier om teknologin.
Deltagarnas ålder spelade ingen roll för deras intresse för teknologiska innovationer
eller intresse för 5G. Det är spännande och anmärkningsvärt eftersom det innebär att
äldre konsumenter kan vara väldigt intresserade av teknologiska innovationer och
därför inte bör negligeras av företag som utför marknadsutformning. Man kan
ifrågasätta om avhandlingens statistiska resultat kan generaliseras för hela

87

befolkningen i Finland eller inte, men ett urvalssampel på 187 ger åtminstone en
omfattande inblick i finska konsumenters erfarenheter och åsikter om 5G.
