ABSTRACT
Subject: Governance of Digitalization
Writer: Zahidul Khan
Title: Custom collaboration of data visualization and dashboard optimization; data simplicity and
accessibility.
Supervisor: Asst. Prof. Jozsef Mezei
Abstract:
Data visualization is incredibly useful for people to know data graphically. The new data visualization
must come up with better ways to process, analyze and visualize a large amount of complicated data.
Visualization is determining what to represent as an example, choosing visual forms to represent objects,
designing underlying computational/analytical algorithms, and also choosing interactions to
attach visual representations with underlying analytics. The dashboard is a mostly visual information
display that individual use to quickly understand the condition that needs a timely response to fulfill a
specific role. It is important to make uncertainty propagation and trust-building within the
data generation process. The dashboard can use an optimization strategy to reduce reaction time, increase
interaction, optimize functionality, and increase other vital results. As an example of a financial
institution, make extensive use of visualization of models as data analysis to identify threats to the
stability of the financial system.
This thesis follows up the expected qualitative analysis relying on documental analysis and secondary
data. Case studies are used to analyze these qualitative studies, including reviews of primary literature.
The case studies were divided into three groups: 1) Financial Organizational Dashboard 2) Healthcare
Institutional Dashboard, and 3) Geopathic Organizational dashboard.
At first, the results of this thesis indicate the optimized visualization of dashboards. Second, it contributes
to the literature on how user-driven visualization tools are organized, managed, and screened from large
amounts of data on the dashboard. Finally, analyze the problems and challenges of visualizing big data
and comparing them to different dashboard visualization platforms.
This thesis demonstrates that dashboard visualization designs and develops optimization processes to
make data simpler and more accessible. According to this thesis, data visualization on the dashboard
means that this function is more than explicit, and it can serve a specific function and express information
more efficiently than the general tabular format. Furthermore, this thesis brings insights into dashboard
orientation research with a deeper understanding of the optimization process using different tools,
platforms, and techniques.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
The amount of data and information collected and retained by organizations and
businesses is constantly increasing due to advances in data collection, computerization of
transactions, and breakthroughs in storage technology. One of the essential benefits of
visualization is that it allows visual access to vast amounts of data in easily edible visuals.
For instance, using a sample of the actual customer, order, and revenue data, we can
utilize Excel and Tableau visualization tools and communicate our findings.
Dashboards are different from other visualization systems. A dashboard can consist of
only a single display that should not have scrollbars or various windows (Few et al. 2006).
The position of the information on the display is essential (Few, 2006). Yigitbasioglu and
Velcu (2012) advocate visualizing information on dashboards and identify several
important features such as tabular data represented as a graph. Graphs also decrease the
information overload in comparison to tabular data [14]. Furthermore, as Eckerson (2010)
describes in his book "Performance dashboards: measuring, monitoring, and managing
your business", the variation in user’s needs warrants different dashboard functionalities,
structures and designs.
Visualization is mainly used in three steps: information collection, information analysis,
and information representation. In visualization, one can represent primary, essential, or
initial information (Verdinelli et al., 2013). Additionally, visualizations can aid in
managing and organizing nicely and display relations among different kinds of applicable
information. Visual representation can be used to reorganize information to locate its
standard components and structure.
Dashboards provide information to the decision-makers using complex data visualization
tools, including drill-down capabilities (Weiner, 2015). Financial or health data-driven
decision-making utilizing dashboards is increasingly essential because administrators use
forecasting and predictive measures for strategic planning rather than relying on historical
or descriptive information.
8

Zahidul Khan 2021

Data-driven decision-making can be defined as "practice rather than decision-making
based on the analysis of information purely on intuition" (Mario et al., 2017). However,
if the decision-making process is based on lower quality data, it will directly affect the
quality and outcome. Therefore, monitoring each stage of the data lifecycle is critical. In
practice, an organization should continuously monitor interesting proposals related to
data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, data storage and reuse of data (Mario,
2017).

3.7

1.1 Background

With the rapid development in ICT services, nowadays, companies generate a vast
amount of transactional data. This boost in the amount of relevant data is changing the
decision-making culture in organizations. Meanwhile, due to the unavailability of
necessary quantitative data, previous academic research often relied on the perception
and management experience, which is very closely related to decision-making, and it also
burdens them with information overload. Dashboards effectively address this problem
with a compelling visualization of enormous data to allow managers to slice and dice it
for better analysis.
Data visualizations provide an excellent approach for exploring data essential for humans
in a form that is drawn algorithmically with graphing, charting, or diagramming software
or using different tools (Noah Iliinsky et al., 2011). Dashboard visualization is a new
term, emphasizing the significance of presenting information to decision makers using
visual communication. With dashboards, important information can be consolidated and
arranged on display to be easily monitored. Dashboards express the idea that one aims to
do more than just represent data in a graphical form: the information behind the data
should also be revealed in a good display. The graphic should help readers or viewers see
the structure in the data. The term data visualization is related to the new field of
information visualization (Chun-houh Chen et al., 2008).

1.2 Purpose and Context of the Study

The aim of this master's thesis is to discover and highlight the general guidelines on
optimizing dashboard design and visualizing data (with the main focus on financial,
healthcare, and geospatial data). Visual analytics, big data visualization, and dashboards
are the main topics covered in the literature review as the main foundations of the
research.

5.7

1.3 Research Questions

In this paper, will equivalently establish a number of objectives that form the foundation
for my research and further help me develop the research questions of this study. Thus,
questions for this study are as follows:
RQ1. What is the role of visualization? What are the optimal ways to create dashboards?
(In order to answer these questions, the first phase of inquiry is performing a literature
review of previous research on the following topics: Visualization, Dashboards, and
optimization Systems, with the main focus of gaining an understanding of different
organizational practices.)
RQ2. How do end-users of an organization utilize dashboards to support decisions
related to measuring and managing performance? How are visualizations used in
decision-making?
(In consonance with these questions, the aim in this thesis is to create a framework for
using dashboards in measuring and managing performance and selecting and evaluating
an appropriate tool for measuring decisions.)

10

Zahidul Khan 2021

RQ3. What existing and new information visualization techniques can be used to
visualize complex data and concepts in organizational dashboards?
(The problem in this question is related to selecting the suitable techniques to be
implemented in different dashboard tools. This thesis's main contribution is to
systematically assess tools that can be used to design and develop information
visualization, such as python, R shiny, Tableau, or Qlik.)
RQ4. How to compare different dashboard optimization solution platforms?
(By analyzing different dashboard visualization tools so that it will offer a baseline for
effective and efficient optimization solutions.)

6.7

1.4 Structure of the Study

This research intends to create a theoretical background for understanding the context of
visualization, dashboard design, and optimization based on utilizing a set scholarly
publication on Dashboard optimization and several real-life case studies. This thesis is
divided into several different chapters; each chapter focuses on some specific issues.
Chapter 1 deals with the introduction to the topic of visualization and dashboards. To
answer the research questions, Chapter 2 presents a literature review on the following
topics: Visual analytics, visualization of big data, dashboards, as well as dashboard
optimization. Chapter 3 describes the theoretical and conceptual background for the
empirical research phase: the theory behind on different visualization model frameworks
and a suitable framework is selected for further analysis of dashboard visualization tools,
the case study of different data frame platforms, testing, and dashboard optimization.
Chapter 4, several case studies are presented focusing on current dashboard trends
through the lensed of the chosen framework. In Chapter 5, the author will also present
the methodology developed based on the results from analyzing the different visualization
process, techniques, tools and also devoted to presenting the different analyzed dashboard
platforms. Chapter 6 is a discussion part, based on summarizes the results, findings from
the thesis questions, and suggests future research directions. Chapter 7 will offer some
conclusions and present the limitations of the study.

CHAPTER 2: RELATED RESEARCH

Traditional Data visualization is beneficial for decision makers to understand data in a
graphical manner. New data visualization tools are continuously developed to provide
better ways to process, analyze and visualize a vast amount of complex data. Most of the
challenges related to these developments involve analysis of perceptual scalability, realtime scalability and interactive scalability. A dashboard is primarily a visual display of
individuals' data to quickly track established conditions that require a timely response to
perform a specific function. It is crucial to create uncertainty propagation and trustbuilding within the data generation process.
Visualization analysis determines what and how to represent in a dashboard, for instance,
by

choosing

visual

forms

to

represent

objects,

designing

underlying

computational/analytical algorithms, and choosing interactions to connect visual
representations with underlying analytics. For instance, considering the case of financial
institutions, it is crucial to study data and information to recognize, interpret, and react to
risks to the financial system's integrity. As this encompasses the whole financial sector,
there is a wide variety of statistics and sources of knowledge to track financial stability
and future risks and threat models and it is a crucial task to optimize how all this
information is presented in a dashboard (Mark D Flood et al., 2016).

2.1 Visualization
As human beings, our visual attention systems consist of both bottom-up and top-down
attention systems, which allow us to allot the most understandable offshoots, positions,
or features that encourage more robust neural activation than the natural scene (Yan &
Marshal et al., 2018). For instance, bottom-up attention helps us to obtain information
about location, color, and top-down modulates the bottom-up attentional signal to focus
on specific objects, like surface or channel. Visual design has its own set of rules of
12

Zahidul Khan 2021

interpretation. The theory of gestalt psychology states that the type of graphical
information and the visual intensity produced by the brain and the response has a visual
effect that attracts the public's attention. Visualization is about presenting information in
the most transparent way possible. Visualization of data or ideas should convey complex
information to an audience in a way that can also be quickly consumed and easily
understood (Smiciklas et al., 2012). However, quantitative data is more easily accessible
with the idea of improving the graphical presentation of the data (Ware et al. 2004). In
particular, data graphics or data visualization is a combination of measurement numbers,
symbols, words, shedding, and color (Tufte et al. 2001). Visualization should have
clearness, accuracy, and efficacy through varied skills. Firstly, in the design phase the
right choices need to be selected when opting for either tables, semi-graphics, or graphics.
Secondly, we need to achieve a level of accessible data complexity by combining words,
numbers, and images; and corroborate the graphics structure with optimizing factors such
as line width, lettering, and graphic size (Tufte et al., 2001).

2.1.1 Visualization Challenges
Visualization is a tactic of creating images, diagrams, and another initiative to understand
the information visually. It is more challenging to visualize small traditional data than big
data.
● In particular cases, some data does not even require visualization for the important
message to be conveyed, rather a simple tabular representation is sufficient.
● For highlighting or uncovering exciting trends, it is crucial that we chose the
appropriate data for the visualization process.
● To visualize big data is more challenging to manifest decision making rather than
critical thinking.
● Sometimes it is challenging to get accurate pictures from the visualization, and
different visual representations may emphasize different aspects of the data
resulting in different interpretations and conclusions.

2.1.2 Visualization Concepts and Process
The main concepts related to visualization include exploring, discovering, summarizing,
presenting, and enjoying, among others (Munzner et al., 2010). A prodigious visualization
is based on how clear the illustration, how understandable the subject matter and how
tailored to the appropriate audience is (Gayane et al. 2018). In the past, it was often the
case to deal with incomplete and uncertain data, but utilizing visualization resulted in a
trustworthy representation. The concepts of visualization changes with technology
development, codifying the data in a suitable format to be visualized effectively.
Although Different types of visual formats exist, typically organizations only use a subset
of tools available for a visual transfer of knowledge, for instance, clip arts or diagrams.
However, visualizations must be mapped to real-world problems and evaluated about
their strengths and weaknesses (Burkhard et al., 2005). Visualization can serve as a basis
for information or knowledge transfer, in order to perceive and interpret information
accurately. Analysis of an organization's customers’ behavior, visualization can aid in
discovering arguments about communication, decision-making and improve information
acquisition and cost optimization to increase profits. For example, line charts, evolution
matrices, and jump plots are great visualization techniques for displaying changes over
14

Zahidul Khan 2021

time. Koponen and Hilden (2019) explained two dimensions of visualization
“Conceptual-Measurable and Explanatory-Exploratory”. The main objective of
explanatory graphics is to transmit information between humans. The facts are clarified
and validated that the graphic designer or developer already knows the details, and the
main difficulty in design is to understand that information to the public. Exploratory
visuals are mainly intended to promote information exploration and observation. The
purpose of exploratory graphics is not to transmit a previously established message by
the graphic designer but to serve as a guide for finding relevant data features for the
reader. The information presented is usually measurable but describes graphics that
display conceptual rather than measurable. Visualization considers all graphs displaying
measurable information, explanatory or exploratory, and infographics.

Figure 2 Visualization space based on Koponen and Hilden (2019) two dimensions of visualization (Data
visualization handbook, page 21)

Visualization is a process using a series of steps that must be performed very carefully to
obtain accurate results. The first step is to collect or import raw data from different
sources and save them properly. Next, through data transformation we can obtain a
coherent data structure and quality after performing data cleaning and removing noise
from the data. The refined data set is then the input to the next step, visualization, where
15

Zahidul Khan 2021

the data provides input to the data visualization tool. These tools then provide the
information in an easy-to-understand format. While applying interactive techniques, the
user must create different views of this created visual structure, each depicting different
information or presentations. For instance, travel information in the form of flow map
visualization allows data to be visualized on two levels of abstraction: to show which area
has the most significant traffic and the most extended visit.

2.1.3 Visualization Techniques

Data representation is a big issue in case of strategic development and evolution which is
required to take a valuable initiative. The way the human brain processes information
and understanding, visualization is more approachable than presenting and relying on
reports. Therefore, we need to know which visualization techniques are more reliable for
better understanding. According to Tamara Munzner Nested model for visualization
design, the higher level is to define the domain and problem of interest; the next level is
to design the data and task abstraction for that characterization; the third level is to
develop visual encodes and techniques for interaction with those abstractions; and the
lowest level is to create algorithms for implementing the techniques in a programmatic
way.

Most of the organization demand straightforward visualizations and task-relevant outputs
(Rothleder et al. 2002). For instance, organizations collect data and visualization plays a
vital role in attaining a long-time beneficial decision. To ensure the right technique for
visualization of data, we need to understand how to graphically represent the data so that
the information is immediately reached to the expected audience. As semi-organized and
amorphous data require new visualization techniques, so the quantity and diversity of big
data encounter challenges. The dashboard creator always focused on how data is
visualized by intelligence and different techniques to make a great visualization. Creating
dashboards by using different tools are a significant challenge to run data.

focused on how data visualizations are processed by intelligences and the techniques that
make a great visualization. Creating dashboards by using different tools are big challenges
to do at Data Runs Deep. In the modern era, visualization has been using different
techniques to create dashboards.

2.1.3 Visualization tools
Visualization must display when information drifted over it, and the zoomable panel
showed that as well. Through the access of available visualization tools, it should be
interactive (Nayak et al. 2016). For instance, municipalities can interact with any
geospatial data. Nowadays, many visualization tools and appliances are available to serve
special needs in each particular field. However, the inclusion of specific additional
features can make these tools more appealing and standout level. In the modern era, there
are many complicated as well as user friendly tools that are available for visualizing data.
Some of these tools have excellent documentation, manuals and design for the users.
These tools are enriched with a wide range of functionalities and provides the facility of
customization to the users (Felix et al. 2016).

Presently, static visualization tools have become more storage-based platforms that could
help users represent raw data in easily understandable graphical formats and produce
customizable bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs. Different types of programming
languages, such as Python, R language, and ggplot2, are used to generate data
visualization. The most common platform for ordinary users is Excel, and proprietary
includes Tableau, Google Analytics, Power BI and other different types of platforms.

2.1.4 Big data visualization
Data visualization is a medium that requires a significant knowledge of standard design
principles, high expertise in modern design software, and, most importantly, insight on
how to visualize the data most efficiently while taking into consideration of the standard
visualization rules. With the overall technological progress, the importance and the
demand of visually decrypting big data sets have never been greater. Data-processing
software can adequately analyze the received information; however, on the consumer end,
this data is useless if it cannot be understood, and that is where the data visualization
techniques step in. The potential design diversity is equally significant, so as the
quantitative information that is behind the visuals. Visualization, however, is not the only
thing that one should focus on when pursuing Big Data. For instance, personal data is
today full of exciting information like location, text, connections, and behavior (Marr et
al., 2015).

2.2 Dashboards
Over the past decade, dashboards have become a standard tool, a term that evolved from
a vehicle dashboard where the driver was responsible for tracking the major functions. In
the modern context, the dashboard can be defined as a visual display of valuable
information used for monitoring, in terms of accessibility and ease of understanding to
draw a strategic decision for a corporation, team or even individual (Eckerso et al. 2010).
Dashboards are usually used to represent data, presenting information to specific
decision-makers emphasis on visual communication. Completely, the dynamic
information can be found on a dashboard. The dashboard demonstrates the key
information decision-makers need to run their business smoothly (Few et al. 2006).
Dashboards are used to support a wide range of information needs, covering all business
efforts that can benefit from an immediate review. Dashboards can be customized for
specific purposes, and an individual can benefit from multiple dashboards, each of which
supports different aspects of a person’s work. The various information and practices that
dashboard can use to support are worth distinguishing, as they often require differences
24

Zahidul Khan 2021

in visual design and functionality. Dashboards can be used to monitor many types of
information and support almost any goal that a company considers important. Control
panels can be classified into different types in different ways. The way that best relates to
the visual design of the dashboard includes its role, be it strategic, analytical or
operational. The design features of the dashboard can be customized to effectively support
the needs of these roles. While certain differences, such as these, affect design, there are
also many common features that cover all dashboards and require standard design
practices. (Renato et al. 2018)

3.1.2 Variations in Dashboards
Dashboard is essential to fulfill one's needs. So, users must have previous knowledge of
this technology. User mainly uses three main types of dashboards: strategic, analytical
and operational but to proceed a support decision all users need to access intuitive and
relevant data (Wayne, 2013). The decision of any organization should be based on their
principle and rationally dashboards are designed to support that decision. Operational
dashboards track organizational and operational development, on the other hand,
analytical or tactical dashboards track administrative projects and processes. Meanwhile,
strategic dashboards generate an organizational need and evaluate a strategy (Wayne,
2013). For example, a strategic dashboard is a reporting tool for monitoring
"organizational strategic KPIs in a visual, informative, straightforward way and also
visualize significant KPIs: customer acquisition costs, customer lifetime value, and sales
target, etc.," contrarily refine their tactics ``track sales forecast (actual revenue vs.
forecasted revenue), supply chain optimization, etc.," also evaluate their operations
"focused on marketing and customer service, etc."
The strategic dashboard is used to monitor the achievement of strategic goals and the
implementation of community-level strategies. Strategic dashboards are normally used in
comprehensively business types while applying organizational strategic goals. A highlevel dashboard might simplify display of mostly static information and corresponding
key performance indicators (KPIs) in an organization (Claire Y. Chen et al. 2015).
Strategic dashboards are usually much graphical, widely summarized and less often
updated. Management strategic dashboard part of monitoring sales activity, top
25

Zahidul Khan 2021

management responsibilities include implementing successful strategies, specific values,
incorporating specific key performance indicators etc. The strategic marketing dashboard
includes a closer look at a more strategic level of marketing activities, even in
collaboration with sales to achieve the best possible marketing results.
Analysts use analytical dashboards to determine efficient skills for complex analysis;
These national analysts provide support to executives, including the development of
various "key-if" situations. Although the Analytical Dashboard depicts a general financial
analysis plan model, more complex models and additional complex sets of formulas can
be created with additional input variables. Analysts typically use these models to
understand data; Data integration, drill-down capabilities and real-time data are important
to them. Analysts can also use statistical skills to develop predictive models. An
operational dashboard is an operational responsibility center used to monitor strategy
operations. It can also be used to support warnings about critical events and interaction
with real-time data. For example, an operation dashboard of a higher automated
generating plant will have different user features. (A good example of an operational
dashboard to monitor state government management in the United States can be found at
http://resources.businessobjects.com/performance_benchmarking.swf.) Each state has
health based on its finances, manpower, information and infrastructure. Is graded. Users
can easily change the base view by using the quick drop-down list for each main field as
well as the overall grade. Each measurement is color coded for a quick way to expand in
different ways.

2.2.1 Fundamentals of Dashboards
Traditionally, the Dashboard can be used to track different business processes, using
existing data. The dashboard often describes the share of different business areas in the
business, geographical distribution and monitoring of periods of different lengths. The
most commonly used are bar charts, pie charts, and pivot tables. (Guni, 2014.) Making a
dashboard should start by listing the metrics which may we want to track. When creating
indicators, it is also a good idea to highlight possible problem areas and areas. It is a good
idea to list these individual metrics under a few main headings, for each of which we can
26

Zahidul Khan 2021

create our own page. Simplicity is also best when it comes to the Dashboard. In an overly
complex or massive Dashboard, it’s hard to bring out exactly the most important findings,
causing the desired gauges to drown in the mass (Imhof, 2014). As with all projects, it is
important to solicit feedback from end users and take corrective action based on these.
Dashboard is possible and even auspicious to develop feedback basis of brainstorming.
Business is also alive, and change will inevitably come. (Wolf, 2016)

CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Dashboard performance optimization techniques
Dashboards need to consider the relationship between meaningful- informative
visualization and performance architecture to make information through web and mobile
devices efficiently. Wayne W. Eckerson (2013) specified three main sets of the
functionality of the dashboard's performance. Monitor is essential for business processes
and operations using measurements that cause notifications when performance falls
behind and manage people and procedures to improve decisions, maximize efficiency,
and run the company in the right direction". Over time, Dashboards may use a specialized
optimization strategy to minimize response time, increase interaction, optimize
functionality, and other vital results. Most of the research reported in the last decade, tried
to fill the gap by developing a dashboard by using different methods.

3.2 Dashboard design space outline and analysis
At the beginning of the dashboard, the complete set of simulation findings should address.
For instance, multi-dimensional representations, such as scatter plots, bubble plots, or
different charts, are helpful in this case. Graphs are demonstrating by data or information
relation, distribution, composition, and comparison such as, "switching different charts,
filtering the results and selecting preferred information can support in clarifying clear
relations between the targets and variables, amongst it also highlight best and desired
designs" (Gadelhak, Werner and Frank el al. 2017).

Figure 7 Dashboard visualization procedures. (Sandra Durcevic et al. 2021)

33

Zahidul Khan 2021

3.3 Optimizing at the database level
Developers rarely suggest relying on an active database interface. In contrast, everybody
assumes ultimately concerning an extract dataset, which benefits from allowing
optimization at the database stage. Data visualization on the dashboard means to be more
than perception for this function, and it can serve a particular function and express specific
information more efficiently than the simple tabular format. For this reason, choosing
visualization should remember for sort of information attempting to rely on the
relationship between two or more variables, to compare two or more factors, by splitting
data into different components and distribute by range and classification of values within
data (Qin, Luo Tang & Li et al. 2020). Database optimization based on a detailed
acknowledgment of the query functionality. In database testing and debugging,
presentation efficiency and database reliability interpret through the context of query
response times. To develop complex queries, the developer usually uses manual methods
to correct the specifics of the database or rearrange the configuration of the index itself.
Like every dashboard developer knows, effectively fixing complex queries boosts
functionality for both dashboard application server and database server. With automatic
database optimization, it is easy to track performance problems, get warnings based on
automated wait time reviews, and use machine learning to simplify troubleshooting.
Automating database optimization strategies helps developers efficiently and effectively
adjust problematic queries and recognize trends that will make the database work
smoothly.

o Optimize and materialize calculations of data
The best way to optimize the dashboard is to enhance the number of queries by
materializing, eliminating columns, and enabling use through rapid views. When
appropriate, use MIN or MAX values instead of AVG values—using Booleans or
numeric formulas instead of string calculations is also effective for visualization because
computers can handle integers and Booleans even faster than strings (Nicolas et al. 2016).
34

Zahidul Khan 2021

Designing a dashboard or analytics platform, native database functionality such as views
can be more efficient. For instance, materialized views of a PostgreSQL function allow
developers to write the outcome of a complex query to a database table and change the
view when the query result is updated.
o Using Different convenient Template
Interfaces have been designed to help viewers easily understand certain styles, models,
and diagrams. Such as, superiors and decision-makers can choose the prototype they like.
If they want to explore the fastest and safest way to construct a company dashboard,
predefined frameworks may be worth exploring, particularly if they do not have time to
establish one from scratch or do not want to design anything on their own. Templates are
a perfect way to save time. By using the online dashboard platform, developers may have
the opportunity to develop attractive dashboards and have all the data in one location
(Noonpakdee, 2018).
o Consider taking the Interactivity Benefit
Interactive dashboards are vital to the dashboard development phase as they provide
developers with a vital ability to edit the data as they move. Through efficient drilldowns
to map zooms and widgets, these features will allow communicating with each collection
of visualized details while keeping complete control of the dashboard. The advanced
dashboard design has built-in multimedia functionality that can help developers to leave
spreadsheets behind while creating a versatile dashboard that is not packed with details
yet. On the opposite, it offers clear and sharp graphics that can explore on a deeper level.
Interactivity aims to create dashboards that can help automate the analytical process by
making them more user-friendly while at the same time providing instant responses to
questions (Yigitbasioglu, 2012). If the dashboard is interactive, organizations have many
possibilities to keep their data easy and efficiently.

35

Zahidul Khan 2021

o Emphasis the right things on the dashboard
Identifying the appropriate actions is necessary for the improvement of the dashboard.
The metrics that the developer wants to monitor can differ depending on organization and
growth objectives, but they should represent a border of all critical points of dashboard
performance of an acquaintance. It may sound traditionalist genuinely, but there are
excellent reasons not to put everything into the dashboard; for instance, highlighting
important metrics can indicate the direct signal of which information is needed and which
is not. The dashboard ought to be straightforward sufficient for indeed a diverted
individual to get a handle on it, and the more indicators we consolidate, the less it has to
be on one screen (McMahon, 2019).
o Sensitivity and parameter analysis of visualization
Sensitivity and parameter analysis of computer codes (Python or R shiny) may meet with
the density of input and desired output of data. If these variables reflect a dynamic or
spatial feature, it is not easy to provide a visualization tool adapted to their functional
nature (R. Alejandro, 2020). The use of sensitivity analysis and different parameter
relations or graphical interfaces may show the variables that drive the optimization
process, forecasting, or predicted objectives also differ from the visualization process
(Gadelhak, Lang and Petzold, 2017).

3.4 Optimizing dashboard performance by using
different tools
Once the developer finalized the dashboard, run a performance check on the dashboard
and its queries to ensure it runs smoothly. The dashboard auditor describes various
obstacles, such as query problems and repetitive requests, and makes suggestions for
improved results. Since different dashboard tools include various widgets, layout, and
quarries, optimization techniques can improve dashboard performances.
36

Zahidul Khan 2021

o Tableau: create interactive visual analytics in the form of
dashboards
Tableau offers the practical solution to a typical academic library problem of how to
efﬁciently explore and make sense of large sets of data with limited human and ﬁnancial
resources. The ability to quickly add or exclude variables and segments, sort, highlight,
and perform other actions to interact with data enhances our ability to make sense of
sizable quantitative information volumes. Most companies use Tableau because it varies
significantly from other advanced software and data visualization programs by combining
data query, exploration, and data visualization into a single process (Hoelscher J and
Mortimer A, 2018). Tableau automatically recommends visualizations or values that
would reflect the data most efficiently after choosing the appropriate measurements or
characteristics and related steps. Tableau has a specialty for its features; for instance, its
data algorithm allows for adjusting time series by year, quarter, month, or day with one
or two user clicks, which can save time and improve the ability to connect with
information. Tableau supports two aspects needed for efficient data visualization: the
ability to represent data clearly and accurately and users' ability to engage with it and
determine what the data means. Tableau gives users the ability to respond to questions
when they occur, removing the need for predefined questions (Sarah et al., 2013).

Tableau dashboard Optimization Techniques:
● Tableau is among the most potent visualization platforms with analytical
capability that demands limited professional competence, and it can also manage
massive data when linking to active resources or interacting with all other
spreadsheet contexts.
● Tableau creates review and debugs of various events, which finds to improve
dashboard performance. For instance, query execution, query compiling,
geocoding, database schema, layout computing, generation extract, data blending,
server rendering, etc.

37

Zahidul Khan 2021

● Tableau is a standard way to set referential integrity in the database by using
international keys, testing user-defined limits or triggers. It is repeatedly joining
1

cull if referential integrity pre-set in the database, which advised to stop using

automated dimensioning to correct the dashboard's size.
● Tableau platforms develop the dashboard's potential to excess worksheets on a
dashboard may affect results. It removes or merges redundant worksheets and data
sources.
● Level of detail (lod) calculations allow the calculation of values at various levels
and variability. Try to avoid large and complex data sets involving views with
many computational complexity statements; they might function dense in a
dashboard.

Qlik Sense: a web-based BI tool for visual analytics2

Qlik Sense is a modern and receptive web-based data analytics platform that can create
spectacular and immersive visualizations embedded with other systems. The platform can
import data from many sites and visualization, and data can prepare in several ways,
including using artificial Intelligence. Qlik can be split approximately into two separate
fields, which are data integration and data analytics. It is essential for modern time
management that all business individuals have quick access to the latest and most reliable
information. Qlik provides so-called data aggregation products for this purpose, such as
simplifying and streamlining data collection, retrieval, analysis, cataloging, and data
publishing (visualizing on the dashboard). Qlik's products for data integration include
Qlik Replay, Qlik Compose, and Qlik Catalog. For example, products can use to process
so-called "raw data" , more ready-made, "analytical-capable" data that can also be moved

from one location to another and then utilized by various data analytics software Qlik
Sense.

Figure 8 how data integration products work in the Qlik platform.3

Qlik dashboard Optimization Techniques:4
Qlik Sense sets the standard for a new wave of cloud data analytics technologies to offer
scalable, most intelligent dashboards. According to data usability, the Qlik Sense
dashboard must be designed for the developer to implement and use it completely.
● Drag-and-drop interface features are reliable for the fast creating of dashboards,
reports, and data visualization.
● Synthetic keys are Qlik's approach to handling dynamic keys as a result of a poorly
designed data model.
● Qlik Sense deals with circular references by labeling one of the tables as highly
correlated with breaking the loop between the tables. In the dashboard, this
restricts the choices made in one field to be circulated to the other fields in the
table, creating uncertainty for the end-user.

● Qlik Sense dashboard has a straight table that could theoretically include millions
of rows of data; consider adding a measurement condition that allows users to
make choices to minimize the number of rows.

o Kibana: Explore, Visualize, Discover Data
Kibana is an Elasticsearch framework for open-source visualization and analytics. To
search, display and interact with their results, it is used with Elasticsearch indices and can
be used with an elegant browser-based user interface to analyze and visualize data as
charts, tables, and maps. Kibana supports several different visualizations that can then
combine into various so-called dashboards. We can quickly and easily follow the data
that we have chosen to see and drill deeper into the data when needed. Elastic stack also
has several ready-made templates that can be used as dashboards. In Elasticsearch,
Kibana can also be used to access the data interactively from the Discover tab. We can
display and execute queries against the document data in each index that fits the chosen
index pattern for a given time. A histogram is displayed for a search query and the results,
visualizing the distribution of events generated by the search over time. For later use and
visualization purposes, search queries may also store.

Kibana dashboard Optimization Techniques:
Kibana is generating several formats and types of visualization and dashboards. The
Kibana dashboard is a series of tables, graphs, metrics, queries, and maps gathered all on
a single panel.
● Developers may use a more optimized plotting for some of the complex fields.
● A simple translation of visualization of the dashboard is to reports.
● Timeline visualization in Kibana allows us to compare data downstream to
understand better results.
● Canvas visualization allows explaining different results effectively.

o Shiny: Web Application Framework for R (Source)
R software is open-source software that generates thousands of packages developed by
many contributors worldwide and processes extensive data in a high-quality method. R
users can use the R studio and shiny dashboard package to effectively and interactively
build an application that will help data analysts work with their analytical problems
without the need to develop program scripts by themselves.5 R software has many
expandable toolkits, for instance, the EHDViz toolkit for web-based, real-time healthcare
dashboards for heterogeneous scientific, healthcare, and wellbeing data visualization
(Marcus et al. 2016). R packages with the R/Shiny web server architecture for data
management, normalization, and high-quality visualization across the web use. Naturally,
Shiny with R enables the adequate segregation of data (fixed), inputs, and output (tables
vs. figures) and allows critical problems such as the function of parameters and
hypotheses in models to retain focus.6 The instructor will go beyond the toy difficulties
required by the spreadsheets' structure without struggling with information clutter and
unwieldy formatting. Shiny introduces a full-fledged programming environment in which
the end-user can quickly scale up to complex models without any costs for basic
applications (J.R. Varma et al., 2017).

o Python: A data maneuvering language
Python is preferable over other tools due to numerous fields of data science. Python is
considered a primitive language and there is also minimal time needed to evaluate the
code and difference constraints on extracting programming signatures. For creating databased analysis and visualizations, Python is a smart language. It also helps to provide a
wide variety of open-source libraries with some impressive features that can be used off

the shelf. Python Dash is a library that allows developers, without the hassle of complex
front-end HTML, CSS or JavaScript, to create web dashboards and data visualizations.

3.5 Future dashboard visualization trends
The universe in which we live is full of devastating data and information that is
continuously streaming, and most people have to decrypt this data to be successful in their
careers. Dashboards transform repetitive and sometimes dense details into visually
engaging perspectives that engage with an extensive range of users. Dashboards are
rapidly changing like other technology. So, the organization must keep on the latest
visualization trends while creating an impactful dashboard.
o Non-Symmetrical design:
Dashboards are usually short pieces of material with ordered rows and columns
containing graphics. In a nonsymmetrical configuration, with an overlay of objects, data
is arranged. It creates an infographic-like visual that can be visually more impressive than
the traditional version of the dashboard. Both sides are specific but still have a visual
weight similar to that.
o Data Storytelling:
In static visualization, including infographics, the storytelling style differs widely from
that of dynamic visualization, allowing users to access and modify details. It enables
individuals more space to experiment but gives creators less power over how the story is
presented, making the visualization more immersive. In the end, participants agreed that
visualization interactivity should be carefully balanced instead of the need to direct
visitors through the results (Kwan and Liao et al., 2011).

42

Zahidul Khan 2021

o Iconography:
Dashboards insert into the navigation panel with labeled icons. Standard icons help users
to work more efficiently and rapidly take action. Each object is iconographic, icon-based,
or symbolized by a symbol where color, shape, and position can map the item's
characteristics. These consist of tiny graphics or pictures accompanied by concise
explanations to precisely understand what they are expecting. The association between
the mission and the representation used as a primary influence on the visualization's
efficacy is similar to all multi-dimensional icons. The effectiveness of the visualization is
similar to all multi-dimensional icons (Pedro et al. 2019).
o Interactivity:
In the dashboard context, the interactivity level depends on the functionality and purpose
of the dashboard. In the new era, dashboards have interactivity between levels and inputs
that enable users to drill down data (linear analysis) to gain more information on different
performance metrics (Yigitbasioglu and Velcu et al. 2012). To view data in multiple
formats and at various aggregation stages, it is indeed essential for the dashboard to
integrate interactivity and versatility. They might provide a creative approach to the style
of data presentation, making it suitable for technical and semantic tasks, including users
with diverse capabilities, for instance, financial reporting and personality tasks, for
instance, highly analytic (Yigitbasioglu and Velcu et al. 2012).
o Gauges Out:
A dashboard gauge needs to be actual and quickly readable under the condition that
interrupts concentration. In that context, we want to have a lower proportion of data to
the area, and it cannot compare multiple gauge charts side-by-side. An organizational
dashboard has to make accessible a lot more information, while data can be
drawn/coded/organized to provide a fast status. A management dashboard displays a
visual gauge marking an alert value, and it is possible to take appropriate steps to fix the
error. Gauges have thus fallen out of favor because they undertake precious space, but it
43

Zahidul Khan 2021

only presents only one data dimension (Sarikaya et al., 2018). Conversely, dashboard
developers use bullet charts instead of gauges. Bullet charts are a more effective means
of comparing multiple performance measure data on a dashboard.
o Color Block:
When selecting colors on a dashboard, the background is essential. Colors can have
meaning for emotions, and these meanings can differ by area and community. The use of
color will assist or obstruct the initiative if the dashboard attempts to extract feelings.
Colors may also have abstract meanings or unique associations that can also specify
location and history. To explain and provide more meaning to the dashboard's intent, the
colors aligned with the participating political parties create an election dashboard. The
easiest way to reach users is by "color blocking, “matching monochromatic background
colors against vibrant colors to illustrate relevant data observations or inconsistencies.
o Dynamic Dashboard:
The dynamic dashboard acknowledges that data presentation is not all about data; the
titles, definitions, marks, and explanations are the glue that keeps the data together and
makes it fully readable. A combination of straightforward, jargon-free vocabulary and a
thoughtful emphasis on the most relevant data involves effective data communication.
The dynamic dashboard appears in various ways depending on how, where, and why the
reader accesses the data. Dynamic dashboards recognize that information and action taken
are not the same as viewing a mobile phone dashboard or projected in a conference room.
The dynamic dashboard can customize for the different needs and wishes of its users.
Most dashboards make the mistake of showing all at once if the vast majority of the data
is useless to any single reader. However, dynamic dashboards make it a top-level, firstorder feature to pick the scope.

44

Zahidul Khan 2021

o Mobility:
Does the dashboard enable the viewer to access the on-the-go data? "Mobility first" is a
clear objective of the modern dashboard. Using different methods relies more and more
on getting data at their fingertips everywhere, anywhere to help them make a suitable
decision quicker. Designers have compelled the user interface to adjust the upcoming
intelligent device trend to view the dashboard or receive relevant alerts delivered on their
modern-day devices.
o Wireframing:
The Dashboard Wireframe Tool is a tested and established means of quickly wireframing
dashboards to sync the data with either the company's needs or fulfill user expectations
and generate maximum performance. A wireframe prototype is provided by the designer
while optimizing the required data streams and core dashboard features. However, basic
wireframe design shows the dashboard's extensive functionality by the layout of the
dashboard and the navigation menu. It explains the dashboard topic and the dashboard's
analytical viewpoint. An overall wireframing position also emphasizes the level it serves
in the dashboard.
o Less-more:
Information and knowledge change all the time, and various queries and analytics need
to take all this uncertainty into account and make it quick. It is where a dashboard's
graphic interface plays an essential function. The data visualizations need to accurately
represent the data and what users choose to draw from it. We want every viewer to have
no less and no more access to the data they need (Eckerson et al., 2013).
"Less is more; it does not mean, though, that we will need to add artistic adjustments or
build an aesthetic of visuality. The art of graphic design works sparingly, ensuring that
any feature and figure is there for a reason on the frame. In scraping of colors, patterns,
pictures, or displays that confuse users or do not communicate essential details, visual
45

Zahidul Khan 2021

designers are relentless" (Eckerson et al., 2013). Some users would like to see a rougher
view of the results, and others could serve with an overview.

3.6 Smart dashboard; data visualization in Artificial
Intelligence
Both data scientists and software engineers set plans, architects, codes, iterations, tests,
and codes to achieve their goals. For software developers, this often means custom coding
applications and microservices; Data scientists implement data integration with
databases, predict through analytical models, and create dashboards to help users navigate
results. Even though dashboards are never going to disappear, artificial Intelligence can
fundamentally change them. Instead of presenting quantitative statistics on several toplevel measurements, modern dashboards would show relevant insights into such
indicators in real-time from millions of documents. They can also send warnings
automatically, create projections, evaluate root causes, propose corrections, advise next
steps, and suggest ways to improve processes. Besides, dashboards will become
unconstrained users will speak, dashboards will respond, and from their cell phones, users
will get immediate feedback, wherever they are. In short, dashboards will get more
intelligent, more efficient, relevant, and more intelligible.

7.7 Dashboard for organizational decision making
The use of a standard dashboard would boost organizational performance by optimizing
reporting processes, reducing the volume of data and information aimed at such
overburdened management, and promoting rapid decision-making (Sarikaya, Correll,
Bartram, Tory, and Fisher, 2019). Dashboard tools are used to determine if there is
sufficient organizational and information technology capacity to support a dashboard, and
if not, how to set up the first dashboard and manage monitoring and review activities
46

Zahidul Khan 2021

(Rasmussen, Bansal, and Chen, 2015). Dashboards of success are information structures
that assist in decision making. Output dashboards are similar to decision making services.
Dashboards serve as decision-making tools based on results. According to W. Eckerson,
(2013) described hierarchical level dashboards can be used for monitoring, measurement,
and management. Monitoring is the method of carrying out a schedule by comparing the
desired output to the actual output and, in some situations, using warning systems to
signal performance flaws. Dashboards are then used to do regression analysis to assess
what caused the bad outcomes. However, dashboards are used to exchange knowledge
within an organization in order to facilitate collaboration and decision making (Mohamed,
Alghamdi and Amer et al. 2014).

CHAPTER 4: CASE STUDIES

These case studies are empirical research focusing on essential information, overview,
selection, implementation, and user reactions. Because of the characteristics of research
questions and goals, a case-study method was chosen for this thesis. Case studies consist
of three phases; the first phase focuses on the financial performance dashboard analysis.
The author chose the case company Stora Enso, based on their annual report and different
strategic, sustainability, and financial performance dashboard from present and past
years. The second phase dives into the health and welfare organizational dashboard study.
The author preferred Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) organization and
their Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation dashboard and information based on
their web portal, articles, and news. The final case study describes the technology's
impact in observing the GeoNode local monitoring dashboard, based on the project work
on "UTU Geoportal Design Compendium" in 2020.

4.1 Stora Enso; Strategic, sustainability and financial
performance dashboard
4.1.1 Overview
Stora Enso Oyj is a pulp, paper, and other forest products manufacturing company with
nearly all of its sales in Europe. Still, there are also some significant operations in Asia,
South America, and the USA. Stora Enso was formed in 1998 when the Swedish mining
and forestry products company Stora AB merged with the Finnish forestry products
company Enso Oyj. In 2020, the average number of employees was 24 4557. In 2015,
Stora Enso was rated seventh globally for sales and earnings among forest, packaging,
and paper business companies. For its first two quarters of 2018, the company was rated
second by net earnings for European woods and paper industry businesses. According to

48

Zahidul Khan 2021

this, some observers believe Stora Enso is the earliest limited liability company on earth.
Notable product cases discovered in 2017–2019 were the brand-new innovations for
sustainable RFID labeling called ECO, which build for distribution chain, retail, and ecommerce innovative packaging features. Stora Enso is a world pioneer in green
technologies for packaging, biomaterials, wood construction, and Paper, part of the
bioeconomy. The company's fiber-based fabrics are reusable, recyclable, and do not
contain any fossil fuels. The company also uses a different technology that provides lowcarbon alternatives to goods dependent on low energy while also addressing global
sustainability issues1.

4.1.2 Drivers for Dashboards
Stora Enso has established a joint venture with another 23 Finnish and Swedish
companies to share expertise and research in the areas of artificial intelligence, deep
learning, large-scale automatic systems, and data. Stora Enso has updated its long-term
financial priorities. Like new growth goals (>5 percent a year except for Paper) and return
on the resources available (the >13 percent goal stands, although it is not now the Forest
Division). There are new group growth targets: The dividend strategy was revised to
allocate 50% without a realistic assessment over the cycle. Additional marks at the
strategic level remain constant. The company's financial review provides the board of
directors with current, deliberate, and detailed information. Financial modeling is directly
aligned with forecasting and the current standard for describing and representing financial
processes. Market-available corporate finance modeling software applications typically
provide simple calculations around basic financial analysis metrics, complemented by a
structural cash flow (CF) dissolution. The resulting figures on the charts are tabular2.

4.1.3 Platform Selection
Bridge by Stora Enso is an automated data storage and cloud-based computing solution.
Data can be used via Bridge Open Platforms for the consumer business processes. It
contains virtualization for the users and the company's exclusive data storage cloud
server. Furthermore, Bridge assures both transactional data and a stable learning
platform3.

stable interface between the Bridge Middleware and Cloud networks and compile the
local mill with IT specifications. Bridge Cloud is a platform that integrates the central
point with the whole supply chain and inventory visibility for enterprise and customer
applications in real-time. For example, the collected data may be enhanced by mixing
products with consumer orders and shipments and providing additional information about
items. The data is accessible via paid and open platforms (Power BI, REST, MQTT, and
Web socket) to enterprise and user applications. Based on Microsoft Azure, Bridge Cloud
ensures safe data collection, improvisation, and international connectivity and delivers
scalable APIs and supply chain management software. Both these modules are integrated
and can be controlled internally or externally with safe access.

4.1.4 Implementation
The combined results of visualization data reflect in their report, including the parent
company, Stora Enso Oyj, and other companies that, directly or indirectly, own over 50%
of voting rights. Integrated environmental and energy data cover their manufacturing
operations. The display and conversion capabilities of Stora Enso omitted, unless the
respective footnoting specified otherwise, from the water, energy, and specific CO2
indicators standardized per ton of sales production. This is because the sawmills have
fewer materiality and conversion processes, respectively, in their corresponding output
and separate revenue metrics relative to board and paper mills. The Board of Directors
and Group Leadership Team of Stora Enso are responsible for preparing the report,
identifying dashboard needs for specific product groupings, and evaluating how they
monitor their KPIs. The reportable segments of Stora Enso are Packaging Materials,
Packaging Solutions, Biomaterials, Wood Products, Forest, Paper, and Other. Operating
segments reflect the Group's management structure and how financial information is
checked daily by Stora Enso's President and CEO, responsible for allocating capital and
reviewing operating segment results. Costs, sales, cash, and liabilities consistently assign
to company units8. Transactions between operating segments are performed on an arm's
length basis and removed during restructuring.

4.1.5 User Reaction
The dashboard technology has sparked a lot of interest. All knows the promise that this
technology has for putting the right knowledge into the right hands at the right time.
However, Stora Enso's mission is to disrupt the global building market by using green
resources and putting stakeholders together. They must comprehend and extract
actionable feedback from our clients, investors, and stakeholders in nearly 60 different
markets worldwide. One of their corporate goals is to generate 15% of their revenue from
new goods and services, thus leading to a more prosperous and green future9. To expedite
the process, they are searching for a partner to translate data into observations and
patterns. They imagine a world in which consumer reviews translated into actionable
knowledge without the need for hours of analysis. Stora Enso's DigiFund facilitates the
exploration and testing of emerging technology. As a result, this initiative, Customer
Insight with AI, will serve as a proof of concept in which the company put the novel
natural language processing technologies and text mining to the test. To be truly
competitive, senior management must incorporate this emerging technology into their
day-to-day decision-making process10. This technology must be used to calculate

strategic objectives. The business intelligence vision cannot be fully understood until this
occurs3.

4.1.6 Lessons Learned
Even though the platform provider had experts at downloading, configuring, and using
the platform, they did not offer any assistance in dashboard design or best practices for
implementing an organization dashboard solution. Stora Enso began designing its
dashboard using numerous tools such as Microsoft Azure, Power BI, etc. Developers
spend more time assessing competent service suppliers for review. In contrast, software
installation and setup were not a problem other than executive dashboard architecture and
implementation.

4.2 Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL);
Promoting and developing social and health care
activities and services11
4.2.1 Overview
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) are research, monitors, and
implements policies to improve Finnish people's well-being and health. THL is a Finnish
expert organization that offers reliable and consistent information on health and safety for
decision-making and field operations. The organization collects and generates
information based on analysis and evidence from registers. They also provide experience
and strategies to help in decision-making. They also represent various stakeholders,
including the state, local and regional decision-makers, social services, health sector
actors, organizations, the scientific community, and the general public. THL collaborates
with their clients and partners to ensure that Finnish people have a comfortable lifestyle
in a healthy but diverse welfare society. THL is working on the implementation of modern
information processing functionality for the reporting and control of the social and health
care systems and the interoperability of multiple information systems. Organization is
also working on the Kanta (personal health account) service. This makes client and patient
data accessible across corporate lines, aiding clinicians with their day-to-day job and
knowledge access. THL also makes the knowledge it generates available as open data. It
makes data accessible to the public sector, businesses, and organizations for management
and product creation.

4.2.2 Drivers for Dashboards
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare supports the extensive use of information
services in social and health care. THL offers open access to data generated and compiled

11

Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) (<https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/about-us/strategy>)

55

Zahidul Khan 2021

at the institute as part of this goal. THL plays a significant role in gathering data on health
and welfare in general through surveys and studies. This knowledge is helpful for
planning, pattern predicting, analyzing, finding challenges. Around the same time, any of
the information is likely to be more valuable than others. When data sets begin to be
obtained, they will carry on a life of their own and remain unevaluated for an extended
period after their supposed original value has expired. THL does not tend to perform such
data priority audits on a routine basis. Like the other Nordic nations, Finland has a
significant comparative edge in international science due to its resources in high-quality
long-term population-based registries. Large, well-collected, insightful data sets are both
global and, most importantly, local commodities. There is tremendous benefit in making
such raw but cleaned data available to the whole population of future users. While THL
creates a value in the high level of expertise in-house in processing and understanding
such complex data, they also emphasize the importance of user-friendly and integrityassured timely data access. They were given the impression, especially by scholarly
sources, that such data was not readily or quickly accessible for their use. This
circumstance did not serve the generation of information by a wider community of
investigators or the general public well. Many basic reports were structured to provide as
many metrics as possible on a single document. There was an attempt to collect vast
volumes of data and display it in a dashboard. The trouble with such displays was that a
0% adjustment was neither the goal nor the threshold for each metric value.

4.2.3 Platform Selection
THL Biobank manages a vast number of high-quality sample collections that are critical
to health testing in Finland. THL Biobank provides access to biological samples and
related data to study projects that are of good scientific standard and effect, are undertaken
ethically, and conform to THL Biobank's research areas:
● Population health promotion
● Identifying conditions that contribute to disease processes
● Disease avoidance

56

Zahidul Khan 2021

● Material production and treatment approaches promoting population wellbeing
and well-being
● Product and treatment practice creation for use in patient insurance and medical
care

Figure 15 Researchers' pathway to THL Biobank resources (Source: THL BIOBANK 2020)

4.2.4 Implementation
The monitoring of information technology systems for social assistance and health care
involves the comprehensive compilation, review, and utilization of data, allowing for
tracking organizational success and goal achievement.
● Administration of social services and health-care associations
● Data on consumers' e-service demands and experiences in area as opposed to other
regions/the whole world
● Data are comparing the region's ability to satisfy consumer demands to other
regions. Professionals in knowledge technology work in social services and health
care institutions.
● Experts in knowledge technology work in social services and health care
institutions.
● Data on how to use own database infrastructure and information system resources
used in comparison to those of others
57

Zahidul Khan 2021

● Data on information systems' usability and customer experiences in comparison
to others
● Developers and administrators of state information management programs
● Knowledge sharing practices' access, usage, and user experiences in numerous
regions

4.2.5 User Reaction
Different user groups include information technology engineers (who learn from
information system user experiences), statistical scientists (who benefit from database
reviews incorporating diverse data sets as a foundation for further analysis), social
services and health care providers, and residents (database reporting makes the feedback
from the professionals and citizens visible). The following dashboards are including in
the first series of dashboards released:
● Healthcare administration (Hospital, Laboratory, researchers, etc.)
● Data views with trending
● Quick report formation using date prompts
● Special to the site (THL)
● Regular THL procedures
● results
● Specialist salaries (which tied to collections)

4.2.6 Lessons Learned
The overarching aim of this study was to explain healthcare researchers’ viewpoints on
patient culture in the THL. Possible modifications have been investigated by analyzing
data from different years. The aim was also to explore researchers’ interpretations of
patient safety culture from two main perspectives: coordination and advisability.

4.3 GeoNode: Monitoring Dashboard (UTU Geoportal)
4.3.1 Overview
UTU Geoportal provides an open repository for geospatial research data sharing
platforms in Finland. In this geoportal, users can discover geospatial monitoring
dashboard and download geospatial datasets, upload and share their own or research
group’s data, create maps and get inspired by reading stories from the geoportal
community. The objectives of UTU Geoportal service are to provide a multi-disciplinary
research and education services for the staff and students at the University of Turku in
the field of geospatial data* management and data sharing and dissemination. The aim is
to establish necessary infrastructures and expertise at the University of Turku to support
the implementation of these services, and train staff and students to maintain and use these
services for improved sharing and dissemination of digital geospatial assets of the
university. The researchers and students of UTU are targeted via data management
studies and open-access learning materials that can be implemented fully or partially in
cooperation with the UTU Geoportal services. As a data download service, UTU
Geoportal is targeted to all public, private and third sector actors. Open, published and
downloadable research data can be used in applicational or further research purposes. As
an open service, UTU Geoportal relies strongly on the user community that provides and
uses the content within and outside the service. As a dissemination service, UTU
Geoportal is targeted to the UTU actors, as well as all other parties interested in
(geospatial) research done in the University of Turku. The platform provides a variety of
ways to communicate about research activities; a visual way of presenting datasets and
maps and linking stories to them. Data and map stories are a powerful way of bringing
our societal and environmental phenomena visible, and an effective way to communicate
with local citizens, media and other communities.

4.3.2 Drivers for Dashboards
Geospatial data visualization can be divided into three stages: the creation of interactive
dashboards, the creation of geospatial dashboards with mapping elements, and the
creation of new geospatial dashboards with geospatial analysis features. It is a dashboard
with a Place and Time portion that conveys information. View things from the viewpoint
of a logistics company; they use these dashboards to see where their distribution partners
are and how well they are doing. Alternatively, geospatial dashboards that aid in the
visualization of weather and natural hazard zones over time. These are not standard
dashboards since they require a massive volume of data to be viewed in a Map or a
timeline, making them cumbersome and heavy. The location component (maps) and time
component are the primary focus of these dashboards (Timeline).

Figure 17 UTU Geospatial lab dashboard (https://geospatial.utu.fi/facilities/geospatial-data/)

4.3.3 Platform Selection
During the project planning phase, there were four main conditions and function
requirements: 1. Web-based for ease of entry, management, updates, surveillance, and so
on. 2. Industry norm to ensure the recruiting of experienced resources. 3. Recognized and
valued pioneer in the area of online analytical processing in UTU dashboard. The UTU
61

Zahidul Khan 2021

web portal design by Python Django which promotes high level, fast development,
smooth and functional design. It's free and accessible.

4.3.4 Implementation
A geospatial dashboard is more than just a compilation and analysis of geospatial data; it
also helps in knowledge mining and decision making. Scalability, interoperability, and
portability are three essential qualities for structuring a geospatial dashboard when
considering geospatial data's multidimensional and heterogeneous existence.
The ability to install and delete hardware (including computers and sensor devices),
software modules and visual user interface (GUI) elements for users without
compromising system availability is referred to as scalability. Widget-based technology
is an example of a modular architecture that allows for high-level device customization.

Figure 18 UTU geoportal dashboard (Source:
https://geonode.utu.fi/layers/geonode_data:geonode:Tungamalenga_LULC)

4.3.5 User Reaction
The geoportal user interface explores how the geonode website should be improved to
engage users and make the website's accessibility appealing and easy to use, providing
users with the kind of appealing website that can keep them coming back. The UTU geo
62

Zahidul Khan 2021

web must provide all appropriate elements to include a degree of engagement that
encourages users to return to the portal. This can be accomplished by taking into account
all of the elements that make up the interface, including the architecture, graphic design,
text, brand, sound, and transactional information. As researchers are the most contributors
of geospatial data, metadata, raster imagery data, map elements data and they also develop
dashboards to the geoportal platform. Students from universities can access these data
sets and dashboard for academic purpose and contribution of their research work,
bachelor and master’s thesis data sets. UTU Geoportal has a project governance structural
dashboard, which oversees the project planning and implementation. The Municipality
user group includes three working groups: Technical, Standards, and Collections. This
group’s primary task has been to develop the functional requirements and provide
ongoing feedback on development progress. For Instance, “Health Data Collections:
responsible for investigating health data collections for inclusion in UTU Geoportal,”
“Teaching and learning: responsible for developing various types of training and
guidance tools and supporting the research portal in the development of relevant UTU
Geoportal features. UTU Geoportal platform also has distinctive users, such as expert
users who have experiences and amateur users like inexperienced new users. Academic
or individual users can use UTU geoportal. Academic users are university researchers or
students, and individual users are any organizational geospatial expert or researcher.

4.3.6 Lessons Learned
The stakeholders have split into two groups for this usage case study. The Data or
dashboard operator is the primary user of UTU Geoportals. These users are someone
whose primary goal is to find information that is important to their interests. A data user
is someone who desires to seek geospatial data in a visualized form but does not want to
or is unable to contribute such content on his or her own. On the other hand, the data
provider is the person who creates the majority of the content and dashboard on UTU
Geoportal. For example, the Data Provider may have personal analysis data or records to
exchange, or he or she may choose to use existing data layers to create map stories. Since
the Data Provider wants to use the same UTU Geoportal functionalities as the Data User,
63

Zahidul Khan 2021

the Data Provider may be an extension of the Data User role. As UTU geo nodes
developed by Django can help remove unnecessary tasks and save time and effort in the
development process. The author strongly recommends Django as a base for new python
web developers, while The Django platform is an excellent place for new Python web
developers to start because the official documentation and tutorials are among the
strongest in the industry.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
The study results for each of the research questions are presented in this segment. The
results include a description of the theoretically relevant roles of visualization and the
optimal way to create a dashboard (Research Question 1), empirical results of dashboard
support visualization of decisions for measuring and managing performance (Research
Question 2), empirical results of data visualization technique by using different complex
data and concepts (Research Question 3) and empirical results of comparing different
dashboard optimization solution platform (Research Question 4). The discussion of the
results, as well as their limitations, are discussed in the following sections.

5.1 Roles of visualization and the optimal way to create
a dashboard

o Visualization role
The sources of information and data visualization exist in many different areas. The
practices and approaches explored are based on many disciplines: graphic design and
illustration, journalism, mapping, computer science, enterprise management and
statistics, etc. Visualization is a powerful tool for communicating thoughts and concepts
to end-users, as well as it also assists in data perception and interpretation. With the rapid
advancement in technology, the role of visualization has changed.

A choice of

visualization tool, design, and process are the requirements for the effectiveness of the
implementation of visualization. Meanwhile, there are references to using visual
perception to interpret and perspective data to assist the cognitive method of data
processing. According to the theoretical research, visualization has traditionally been
divided by two categories: information visualization and scientific visualization.
Information visualization represents conceptual and non-spatial data, while scientific
visualization develops visual techniques to represent scientific and spatial data.
65

Zahidul Khan 2021

Visualization is usually used as a set of methods to help people understand and analyze
big, complex data sets. According to the UTU geoportal case study, visualizing
geographic data improves our ability to communicate how different variable maps can
relate to geographic location.

o Dashboard design and performance optimization
Dashboards rely on the concepts of visual observation, like other different visualization
methods. The use of Gestalt psychology for visual perception can be demonstrated in the
dashboard. Gestalt describes several concepts of how the human brain displays
information, including proximity, similarity, consistency, continuity, closure, connection,
and enclosure of visible information. Some examples are shown below.

● Principle of Similarity
The principle of similarity, also known as symmetry, means that people want to create a
relationship between the same elements in a design. Distinctive specific elements, such
as the form, color, or scale of the elements, to create similarity. Figure18 presents a set of
shapes formed in rows. Visually, red shapes form separate groups from each other
indicating Happiness ranking and Economy GDP per capita that are distinguishable to the
human eye.

Figure 19 World Happiness report 2019 (Similarity by shape) Data Source:
(https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2019.csv)

66

Zahidul Khan 2021

● Principle of Continuity
The continuity principle is based on part of the principle of similarity. The Gestalt
continuity law describes the visible lines of elements clustered together in the human
brain, as a proposed trend follows its line in a way that can be seen. The human brain
prefers to imitate rather than deviate from the path of a particular sequence under theory,
and the letter "X" is an excellent example of this - we interpret it as two lines overlapping
each other with four in the middle.

Figure 20 The World Happiness Report (Happiness rank vs Economy GDP per capita)
Data Source: (<https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2019.csv>)
The value of a dashboard is determined by its structure. Without the correct configuration,
a dashboard can simply display data and have no meaningful insights. Data is overloaded,
and the dashboard becomes slower to load visual information and reports, forcing users
to wait. These are a widespread issue for data analysts and report users. The dashboards
may have been fast when they were first designed, but their efficiency and usability have
deteriorated over time. Many technical elements operate to create a dashboard or
monitoring framework. On the basis of theoretical analysis and case study, some actions
can improve dashboard performance such as improving the data model's foundation
67

Zahidul Khan 2021

visual technique optimization and using a different tool to cache report data. Dashboard's
practical interface functions, such as presentation style, table vs. graphics, scene analysis,
automatic notifications, the hierarchy of formats, drill-ups, and any decision on external
benchmarking, should be included in any decision on the dashboard. They can make weak
decisions by keeping indicators. The practical interface features of dashboards are a
relationship between dashboard objectives and decision-making.

5.2 Visualization technique complex data and concepts

The visualization of data can be assessed systematically and provides an initial
visualization model for data mapping in visual form. In this context, extensive
visualization frameworks such as Tableau can be effectively modeled on datasets and
visualized in appropriate ways. Data and visual shape are two components of the
reference model. The first step is to process the raw data in the table. The next step is to
map the data tables with visual structures, then convert the visual structures into concepts
that users can understand. The visualization structure is described in the mapping of data
tables in visual constructs which is probably the most important of the models.

5.2.1 Hypothesis of the visualization technique
This part of thesis study is an experimental design to test the hypothesis that the
visualization process of an organization. The author chose to use ‘SMEAR-station
network data (Station for Measuring Ecosystem Atmosphere relations)’ for visualization
and data were collected from the SMEAR III station database platform (web portal:
“avaa.tdata.fi”). Smear research stations are to measure the relationship of atmosphere
and forest in borealis climate zone. SMEAR III station dataset the year of 2019 and it is
located in Kumpula about 5 km northeast of the Helsinki center. The dataset has monthly,
daily and hourly Air temperature, Dew point, Relative humidity, Air pressure, Wind
speed, Wind direction, Precipitation, Rain intensity, Rainfall, Snowfall, Virtual
68

Zahidul Khan 2021

temperature and Visibility in the year 2019. Collecting the dataset is sensor data, so the
author followed “Munzner’s model of visualization design” (summarized in the User
Journey Map, Section 4.3.2). Tamara Munzner suggested using the term “Infovis” for
information visualization when the spatial representation is chosen (author used python
data visualization tools) and “Scivis” for scientific visualization when the spatial
representation is given. For data visualization followed by three steps (as trail Munzner
advice of visualization process):
● Data Abstraction: First, categorized the data into items, which themselves have
attributes. the author modified the column name and also changed the data frame
months name integer to string by using python datetime.
● Task Abstraction: Task abstraction helps to define what the actual goal of the
visualization is supposed to be. As SMEAR III is a meteorological sensor data, the
author described the features and found out the similarities of data, so data need to be
reshaped and rearranged. This process gave a nice and clear overview of the data
which requirements in visualization these data types might carry in them.

● Idiom: Based on the data types and tasks as defined in the first 2 steps to choose a
fitting visual encoding. We have separated the graph by Air temperature, Dew point,
Relative humidity, Wind speed Wind direction and Precipitation. While the boxplot
provides data display that shows the relationship between two numerical variables
comparatively monthly Temperature, violin-plot shows frequencies of dew point in a

Data Plotting

The temperature of 2010 at Kumpula region was measured from SMEAR station. The
box plot and scatter plot show the different temperature over year where month is in xaxis and temperature (degrees) is in y-axis. It is clearly shown that the temperature varied
from -20 to 31 (°C). The lowest temperature was measured as -20 °C in January and the
highest was 31°C in July 2019.

70

Zahidul Khan 2021

The dew point is another important parameter in the atmosphere which tells the
temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. After
further cooling of the temperature, the water vapor becomes condensed to form liquid
water known as dew. Above violin plot shows the dew point of Kumpula over 2019. It is
clearly shown that the dew point was minimum in January ( -21 °C) and highest was
measured both in June and July (20°C). Here, the measurement of dew point is related to
the humidity of the weather, higher dew point temperature tells the presence of more
moisture in the air.

71

Zahidul Khan 2021

Wind speed is another important parameter of the atmosphere which is basically caused
by air moving from high to low pressure. The above line plot shows the wind speed (in
m/s) for different days of 2019 measured in the Kumpula Campus. From the data, it is
clearly shown that the wind speed varied from 1 to 10 m/s (3.6 km/h to 36 km/h).
(N.B: If the author use month in the x-axis the data squeezed and not understandable at
all)

Above line Chart shows the precipitation over different days of 2019. The definition of
Precipitation is “Any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls
under gravity”. This is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the
atmosphere to surface of the earth. There are several forms of precipitation, for example,
72

Zahidul Khan 2021

drizzle, rain, sleet, snow etc. During precipitation, a portion of the atmosphere is saturated
with water vapor and becomes condensed. From the graph, is shown that during the
beginning of 2019 the precipitation of Arabia area was 970 to 980 mm, and it changes
from 950 mm to 1020 mm during different times of the year. The highest precipitation
was measured during 50 days of the year (February) 2019, this is probably indicating that
there was the most snowfall of the year during this time interval.

Beyond Histogram shows the relative humidity of the Kumpula over 2019. This
atmospheric parameter explains the ration of the partial pressure of water vapor to the
equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature. So, this parameter totally
depends on the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere.

5.3 Dashboard decisions measuring and managing
performance

Integrating big data, algorithms, and visualization will undoubtedly be a modern frontier
in the coming decade. Most significant improvements have also arisen, but since most
communications only require a specific aspect. When resources become accessible,
exploring actual data using user-friendly interactions can be much more practical. For
example, high-precision communication technology analyzes the structure of integrated
decision support system delivery for interconnection technology. Decision-makers should
experiment with rich datasets and visualize their results spontaneously with the same
results immersion tools instead of applying pre-processed templates. As a result, users
can create alternative situations based on their unique data preferences. Dashboards may
be used by superior companies, organizations and the government to make decisions.
Data can be generated by or collected by the company. The data may need to change to
the data attributes and completely collected by different conducts. So, the data need to be
analyzed and visualized in dashboards. The use of the dashboard could lead to clarity or
accountability and eventually increase organizational confidence. The dashboard will also
promote the commitment of customers. Companies or organizations may also create
dashboards to decide themselves based on community participation feedback.
A dashboard improves the consistency of evaluation and measurement of individual
departments and business units. For example, the case study organization StoraEnso
operates in more than 50 countries and markets with different marketing strategies.
Companies did not have a community before the global system dashboard was
implemented (limited to data collection); Such as, the company developed a dashboard
on mobile applications to quickly and efficiently receive technical support regardless of
location and time area. It helps to evaluate performance (who or what performed well)
and monitor development (what learned). StoraEnso has created a dashboard based on
the pioneering role and potential for development in packaging, construction solutions,
and biomaterials with the business standards of the strategic planning unit. StoraEnso not
74

Zahidul Khan 2021

only communicates results but also values an organization’s performance by selecting
indicators on the dashboard.

Figure 20 Dashboard design, implementation and decision making (Source: O.M. Yigitbasioglu and O.
Velcu, 2012 page 47)

The Dashboard Performance Management policy is used in many organizations and is
available as a solution for case organizations and other platform providers. The basis of
this model is the quality of continuous data and features. The dashboard is identified as a
collection of key performance indicators and priorities for implementing performance
management performance strategies and an idea and technical support tools for managing
and achieving those goals. Dashboards can provide data in real-time by aggregating
75

Zahidul Khan 2021

collected data and extracting values. These details are now available in a more pleasing
and manageable format. Different factors affect the success of an organization and by
looking at such real-time data in a visual environment, it is easier for an organization,
company or project to automatically see and identify a mistake.

5.4 Compare dashboard platform

In this modern age, data volume and quality increase tremendously with each
organization. It is hard for developers to get more value from their results if they don’t
have to worry about it for specific decision making. Dashboard should be used as an
essential method for monitoring and controlling the situation of any organization.
Decision makers or superior can easily and quickly understand the market data accurately
and thoroughly in a single graphical interface at one stage. To get the best results,
developers need to ensure that the dashboard platform has all the necessary features. For
the best purposes of the dashboard, developers need to use dynamic visualization
techniques by using a different embedded analytical method such as web portal, intranet,
or company own software application. The dashboard needs to have a global filter panel
where users or viewers can avail selected filter options to quickly drill down into the data
with just a few clicks. The below figure shows the key aspects of the dashboard platform.

76

Focusing on accessibility and usability features, the dashboard interface has a variety of
visualization areas, each with a mix of different color schemes, tabular and graph
displays. Following table shows a summary of different dashboard platforms, the purpose,

CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION

This chapter has two objectives; the first is to assess the study performed and the results
obtained against this thesis's research questions and limitations. The second aim is to
explore how the methodology and possible uses of the theory described in this study can
support future studies. During this study, the focus progressively moved from the specific
viewpoint on optimizing simple process improvement and it finds the optimal process
using accurate, personalized, and complex tools.

6.1 Evaluation of the result
This study discovered that the database queries could be used as data sources for solutions
applied in real-world situations. It makes the data more complex than it is in real life.
Additionally, the data is conveniently up to date if appropriate and has no processing
errors. It is hoped that SQL, Python, or coding experts and others familiar with simulation
will help implement database-based solutions. It should be considered when developing
future dashboard implementations.
Data set is often collected from many data sources. For example, Power BI contains
extensive data connectors that allow the user to merge different information from Excel,
SQL, and other sources. Visualization is visually displaying collected data by using
various charts, graphs, or other visualization tools. Nowadays, people use business
intelligence solutions to focus on data visualization. The data analysis tools promote
user’s comprehension of daily business results, view patterns, and execute relative action
plans more effectively through computer graphics modeling technologies. Users may
generate reports or dashboards after building a dataset. A dashboard is a communication
tool for displaying report extracted results. One of the usual features is that the dashboard
includes only one tab, so the information presented is more summarized and focused. A
82

Zahidul Khan 2021

timely dashboard provides quick management, acquisition, and comprehension of results
in a constantly evolving market world.
One of the goals of this research is that the views of the dashboard can be used to display
different data in the raw form of the show. The author wants to use dashboard views to
make it easier to understand and internalize this knowledge. Planned an exercise was used
to test the efficiency of the dashboard visions. Different topics were used to evaluate the
suitability of the dashboard.
Many aspects should be focused on to design a valuable dashboard. First of all, effective
user content should be given by a dashboard. Decision-makers should be able to examine
data facts meticulously. Visualized data on the dashboard is also important for decisionmaking. The designer needs to define which information is necessary for users before
developing the dashboard. Secondly, it should highlight the importance of choosing
appropriate visualized techniques which can help users to understand data quickly. As a
dashboard provides people, such as storytellers, with facts and statistics, it must provide
a clear and intuitive view.

6.2 Future Study

This thesis provides a framework for developing dashboard visualization. This is an
ongoing phase like other running visualization or dashboard development processes. This
study primarily focuses on the analysis and development of various methods in dashboard
visualization.
The user community's needs must be identified as simple as practical, and it is a bright
idea to enlist the help of someone familiar with the data to assist in the visualization
process. For example, it is now easier to choose chart formats, set chart attributes, and set
alert limits. When creating a dashboard, keep in mind that providing additional details is
not enough. Such an Excel solution is sufficient for one-time tasks like tutorials, as it
83

Zahidul Khan 2021

demonstrates the simple functionality given to the customer by the software-based
business object dashboard.
Although the idea of autonomous decision-making can encourage images of face robots
that replace humans. AI will increase productivity and encourage employees to
concentrate on valuable work. Also, dashboard developers need algorithm setup,
configuration, and tuning, exceptional handling, as well drift adjustment for models and
data. Approaching dashboards will not only be used for any KPI measurements or display
but also these are used as aggregate points in real-time. AI-generated alerts and
observations will be collected, integrated, and displayed so that employees can properly
manage and refine business processes and strategies. Decision makers no longer have to
look at their organization through the lens of an AI-powered dashboard.

84

Zahidul Khan 2021

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
Data recovery is paramount as many professionals can understand and take decisions
from the dashboard. However, the industry is changing, and we need an analytical
platform for anyone who does not need too much effort to explore information,
understand, and deeply collaborate. Dashboards are data-driven decision-making systems
that help improve professional skills, evidence-based practice, and success monitoring in
the industry. The ability to deliver feedback and study optimization in this research has
led to the analysis of the potential to create cost-effective feedback portals based on
affordable dashboards. In the future, dashboard developers will analyze the proposed
system by using innovative methods, tools and applications.

7.1 Contributions
The primary contribution of this thesis is an optimization process of dashboard
visualization systems by using different tools and platforms. Available at
(https://github.com/zahidul-khan)

7.2 Limitation of the research

The thesis is limited to case organizations related to their dashboard functionality and
results organization to dashboard. It is not easy to get the actual dashboard scenario using
annual reports and web presented dashboard.
The focus of the thesis case was limited to the use of dashboard optimization to see the
performance of the organization. There are a variety of dashboard performance providers
on the market, each with its own features and built-in software solutions. As a result, the
findings of this case study are limited to the functionality provided by the case company
and cannot be applied to the entire dashboard optimization process. It is conceivable that
if more organizations had been included in the study, the case organizations dashboard
strategy would have been used more varied in the research.
