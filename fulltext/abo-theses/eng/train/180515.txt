ABSTRACT
Title:

Degradation of polydimethylsiloxane in simulated industrial
process environments

Date and place:

Åbo, January 2021

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is commonly used in the Kraft process as an anti-foaming
agent, which is added during the pulp-washing stage, where the pulp is separated from the
black liquor. Crude tall oil (CTO) is later obtained from the process as a by-product and it
can be further distilled or upgraded into renewable diesel or other products. However, traces
of PDMS have been detected in the CTO and its distillation fractions. This has caused
problems in the oil refineries, especially in the hydrotreatment processes, where it causes
catalyst poisoning and solid deposits. The purpose of this work was therefore to investigate
the fate of PDMS in industrial conditions, such as elevated temperatures and in different
fatty acid-based matrices. Experimental work was carried out at Åbo Akademi University,
where heating of PDMS in fatty acid-based matrices was carried out in sealed pressure tubes
placed in a sand bath on a hot plate equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The effect of an
adsorbent and the degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 at a slightly larger scale and higher
temperature was also tested using an autoclave. The degradation rate of PDMS was analysed
using HP-SEC, and the degradation products were analysed using NMR, GC-MS, and GCFID. The fastest degradation of PDMS was observed in the bio-oil 4 matrix, followed by the
bio-oil 1 matrix. Somewhat slower degradation was observed in bio-oil 3 and the least
degradation in bio-oil 2. The degradation products were found to be cyclosiloxanes ranging
from D3–D8, which subsequently suggested the degradation mechanism to be in the form of
well-known back-biting reactions seen in the thermal degradation of pure PDMS. Based on
results from an experiment and from the composition of the matrices, the catalytic
component and driving force behind the degradation of PDMS was suggested to be the fatty
and/or resin acids in the matrices.

1 INTRODUCTION
Silicon (Si) is the 14th element in the periodic table and the second most abundant element on
earth after oxygen. It is a very valuable element with properties similar to those of carbon. 1
The tetravalent element rarely occurs in nature in its elemental state but rather in different
forms of silicate minerals such as quarts, sand and glass. The term “silicone” is a misnomer
as it was originally believed to be related to the ketone group. The name stuck and is
sometimes used as a generic name for all monomeric and organosilicon compounds. In a
more restricted sense, silicones, or polysiloxanes, are organosilicon polymers containing
alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with organic groups bound to the silicon, typically
methyl groups (Figure 1).1–3

Figure 1. General structure of polysiloxanes, where R is an organic group.

The strong and flexible bonds in the Si-O repeating siloxane structure in combination with
organic moieties give rise to unique properties, such as low temperature sensitivity, making
silicone-based products functionable over a wide temperature range compared to other
organic polymer materials with carbon-based structures.3,4 These properties allow the use of
silicones in many different fields such as aerospace (very low and high temperatures),
building industries, electronics (insulation) and even in biological applications such as health
care due to its excellent biocompatibility. The length and rotational freedom of the Si-O
bond also allows for low energy configurations at interfaces, leading to low surface tension
values. This has led to the use of silicones as a hydrophobic building block for surfactants.4
Because of the hydrophobic properties of silicones and since they are generally not soluble
in water, they are used as an antifoaming agent in industrial applications. The silicone floats
on top of water as an oily liquid, breaking the contact points between the bubble and water.
This breaks the bubbles and prevents the formation of foam.4 Polydimethylsiloxane-based
(PDMS) oils are the most widely used antifoams in industrial settings. Although PDMS can
be an effective antifoaming agent in itself, it is often modified with microscopic
hydrophobically treated silica particles in order to increase efficiency. The fluid polymer
carries the silica particles to the foam air-water interface where they break the liquid films. 4,5

__________________________________________________________________________
One example of industrial uses of PDMS is in the pulp and paper industry, specifically the
Kraft process, which is the most dominant pulping process. The Kraft process produces
stronger pulp compared to other methods and allows for high chemical recovery, greatly
reducing costs.6,7 In this process, the wood is impregnated with an alkaline liquor (white
liquor) consisting of NaOH and Na2S, dissolving the wood at high temperatures in a digester.
Here, the cellulose fibres are liberated by dissolving the lignin that binds the fibres together,
and esters from fatty acids, resin acids and sterols in the wood start to degrade in reactions
that generate surface-active molecules.8,9 This liquid stream of spent pulping chemicals and
dissolved wood is called weak black liquor, which is separated from the pulp by washing.
The surface-active molecules generate large amounts of foam during the pulp-washing stage
and relatively high molecular weight (MW) PDMS-based oils are therefore added to the
stream as antifoaming agents, as the foam would otherwise cause problems such as reduced
washing efficiency and spilling from overflow.7,9 After the washing, the weak black liquor is
allowed to settle, and (non-volatile) tall oil soap, which has a lower density than the black
liquor, settles as the top layer and is skimmed off and collected as a by-product.6 The liquor
is then evaporated in the Kraft recovery system, where other volatile extractives are
recovered, while the remaining “heavy black liquor” is burned in a recovery boiler to recover
energy and inorganic materials. If the tall oil soap is not collected, the efficiency of the
recovery boiler decreases, and sulphur emissions start to increase.6–8
Crude tall oil (CTO) is produced by liberating the fatty acids and rosin (resin acids) in the
tall oil soap by addition of heat and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with an average yield of 30–50
kg/ton of pulp. The CTO is distilled and fractioned, yielding light oil, fatty acids, rosin and
pitch residue, also known as tall oil pitch (TOP). This CTO and its fractions are used for
chemical purposes in various industrial applications such as in oils, asphalt, paints, printing
ink etc.8 It has also been shown to be a viable and cheaper alternative to biomaterials such as
vegetable oil in the oil refining industry. As the removal of tall oil is beneficial to the Kraft
process and as industries strive to reduce the use of fossil fuel, utilizing CTO in biorefineries
and converting it to fuel is highly beneficial.6
However, significant traces of silicon compounds from the PDMS antifoaming agents have
been detected in the CTO in the form of cyclic oligomers or high MW PDMS. These
compounds have been causing problems such as undesired solid deposits and catalyst
poisoning in refining processes, particularly hydrotreatment, where cyclosiloxanes are
adsorbed on the catalyst surface.10,11 In this work, PDMS degradation phenomena in selected
bio-oils will be investigated in simulated industrial process environments in order to gain
further knowledge of its stability and degradation products.

2 THEORY
2.1 Silicones
2.1.1

Chemical properties

Unlike the carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), the silicon-oxygen double bond (Si=O) is
unstable. The silicones therefore tend to form single bonds (Si-O-Si), which makes them
capable of forming polymeric compounds with oxygen, while carbon instead tends to form
single molecules with oxygen. This gives rise to the different behaviours between the two,
the silicone backbone builds up with oxygen, while carbon-based compounds are degraded
by oxygen to form carbon dioxide.2 The silicon-oxygen bond in combination with the lack of
double bonds in the backbone of the structure also leads to chemical inertness, meaning it
cannot be attacked by ions or radicals such as ozone (O3). Silicones also have great thermal
stability, which can be attributed to the strong Si-O bond with a bond energy of 106.0
kcal/mole, much higher than the 84.9 kcal/mole for a carbon-carbon bond. Another
contributing factor is the fact that silicon is less electronegative than carbon, resulting in
bonds with carbon and oxygen that are partly ionic. The polarity in these bonds allows for
greater freedom of motion and flexibility within the molecule, giving silicone its unusual
thermal properties and low surface tension values from low energy configurations.3,4

2.1.2

Structure and terminology

The silicon in polysiloxanes can be bonded with up to three organic groups, with the
remaining valences satisfied by oxygen. These groups, containing silicon, oxygen and
organic groups are referred to as siloxane units in the polymer. Both the complex ion SiO 4-,
which is the structural unit that forms silica and silicates, and the organosilicon compound
R4Si with four organic groups do not form polymeric compounds.2
As silicones in industrial application are often polymeric, a chemical shorthand or the
silicone backbone has been developed for simplicity’s sake, making it possible to name even
the more complicated polymers rapidly and clearly (Table 1).

An “M” siloxane unit is monosubstituted,
meaning one oxygen atom is bonded to the
silicon atom.

A “D” unit is disubstituted

A “T” unit is trisubstituted

A “Q” unit is tetrasubstituted

If organofunctional groups are introduced, an “*” is added. “M*” units are thus
monosubstituted with organofunctionality (Table 2).2,4

2.2 PDMS degradation
2.2.1

Environmental degradation

High MW PDMS from industrial and domestic applications, such as oils, antifoaming
agents, shampoos, detergents, and polishes, can enter the environment in different ways, e.g.
from heat transfer fluids spillage in outdoor applications, or more commonly via the
wastewater in the sewage system. The water insoluble PDMS has a high adsorption
coefficient and adsorbs to the sewage particles, and if not treated and removed properly, the
PDMS will end up in the sludge. The sludge is disposed by either incineration, soil
amendment or by landfilling. The two latter options result in PDMS being transferred from

an aqueous environment to a non-aqueous environment where degradation can take place.12–
14

Degradation studies of PDMS in soil have been carried out in laboratories using 14C-labelled
dimethyl units in the PDMS. Two studies conducted by Buch and Ingebrigtson (1979) and
Lehmann et al. (1998) showed that the moisture content and clay content of the soil affected
the hydrolysis rates of the PDMS. PDMS was shown to exhibit significantly less
rearrangement in moist or wet soil and degrade more rapidly in dry soil. PDMS migration
both upwards and downwards was also noted. PDMS located several inches below the
surface in wet soil can migrate to the dry surface soil where it degrades via clay-catalysed
rearrangement.15,16 Several other studies also indicate that the degradation products are
influenced by clay-catalysed processes.12,15,17 The study by Buch and Ingebrigtson noted a
loss of approximately 80% of the PDMS via volatilisation in the form of cyclic species with
some trimethylsiloxy end-blocked linear species, while the remaining 10–20% consisted of
polar solvent soluble siloxanols. Later studies, however, only found silanols. This was
explained by the high concentration of PDMS used in Buch and Ingebrigtson’s method (1%).
The main breakdown product has later been determined to be dimethylsilanediol (DMSD).
DMSD is then either biodegraded or evaporated into the atmosphere where it is further
degraded by OH-radicals in the presence of sunlight.12,13 A later study by Lehmann et al.
(2000) noted similar results in natural environments compared to the ones in laboratories,
with a more rapid degradation in lower moisture during the hot and dry months.14
Xu. et al. (1998) observed varying catalytic effectiveness of Ca-saturated clays using
HPLC/GPC analysis, where the most effective clays shifted the peaks to longer retention
times faster. The researchers found that, on the one hand, Ca-kaolinite, Ca-beidellite and Canontronite were the most effective in catalysing PDMS degradation, whereas gibbsite
(Al(OH)3) and goethite(α-FeOOH) were significantly less effective. On the other hand, the
former mentioned mineral clays have much higher surface areas than the oxides (gibbsite
and geothite), and after normalizing the results to the specific surface areas, it was found that
on a surface-area basis, gibbsite and kaolinite are the most effective, demonstrating the
critical role of clay surface area. However, surface area is not the only factor influencing the
degradation rates, as clays with similar surface areas induced different degradation rates. The
role of surface properties such as Brønsted and Lewis acidities are therefore stressed. Lewis
acid sites are suggested to catalyse hydrolytic degradation of PDMS by coordinating the
otherwise methyl group-shielded Si-O bonds in the backbone of polymer, exposing and
weakening them for attack by water. In this study the main breakdown products were found
to be silanols. The hydrolytic degradation of PDMS, forming these silanols such as DMSD
can be seen in Scheme 1.17

2.2.2

Thermal degradation

The thermal degradation of PDMS has been studied extensively for over 70 years.18 It is
generally accepted that PDMS degrades primarily via internal, chain “back-biting” reactions
(Scheme 2), yielding cyclic siloxane oligomers with D3 as the most abundant product and
decreasing amounts of D4 to D6.19–23 The back-biting reactions can occur in two different
forms. One being the hydroxyl chain end attacking the backbone of the polymer, producing
cyclic oligomers varying in size depending on the attack point. In the other mechanism, the
polymer chain folds back on itself in a cyclic transition step where a rearrangement occurs,
forming a new Si-O bond and subsequently a cyclic siloxane oligomer. This transition state
can be formed anywhere in the polymer chain and take place indefinitely until the structure
is too short to cyclise and/or when evaporation of the shortened chain components is more
favourable. This mechanism produces a cold-ring fraction of cyclic oligomers with ring sizes
of D7 or greater in addition to the primary degradation products.23–25

The degradation of PDMS differed in vacuum from inert atmospheres. A Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA) of PDMS under a flow of helium determined an onset non-oxidative thermal
degradation temperature of 418 °C and a maximum temperature of 524 °C at which the
maximum rate of mass loss occurs. A Thermal Volatilisation Analysis (TVA) conducted in
the same study showed an onset degradation temperature of about 310 °C and a maximum
volatile evolution rate at 487 °C in vacuum. The differences in the degradation temperatures
were speculated to stem from the fact that the TVA is conducted under vacuum, but a
catalytic effect on the surface of the borosilicate glass TVA pyrolysis vessel was also
hypothesised.23 Similar results were noted by Grassie and Macfarlane in 1978. Their TVA
indicated a non-oxidate thermal degradation temperature of PDMS starting at about 300 °C
with a maximum volatile evolution at 443 °C.22
The thermal degradation of PDMS also yields different results when in contact with air and
when in inert atmospheres. In a TGA conducted by Camino et al., comparing the thermal
degradation in air and in nitrogen, it was found that there are at least two stages of
degradation in the oxidative degradation. The first stage starts at about 290 °C (T 1max=
339 °C), much lower than in nitrogen with a Tmax of 514°C. The second stage starts at about
400 °C (T2max= 445 °C). The first step can be explained by a catalytic effect from the oxygen,
resulting in an earlier weight loss from the depolymerisation to cyclic oligomers. The
volatilisation is then slowed down before the second step. This is explained by condensed
phase oxidation of PDMS, resulting in tight crosslinking of the polymer with an increased
thermal stability (Scheme 3). At 400 °C the crosslinked structure starts to break down.25
These results are comparable with the TG analysis earlier mentioned that noted a maximum
weight loss at 524 °C for degradation in an inert atmosphere.

Scheme 3. Crosslinking reaction proposed by Camino et. al.25

The degradation of PDMS caused by oxidation most likely proceeds through a peroxidation
reaction caused by free radicals R•, yielding primary hydroperoxides (Scheme 4).

These hydroperoxides then decompose, releasing hydrogen (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5. Breakdown of primary hydroperoxides.25

Because this has been studied for so many years, the thermal degradation behaviour of
PDMS is well understood, but one must remember that these reaction models are based on
simplified laboratory studies. Antifoaming agents in industrial applications for example are
often only based on PDMS and may contain other fillers and impurities. In real processes the

9

Oscar Nyman

conditions might be much different, and the degradation may be catalysed or otherwise
influenced by other factors.

2.2.3

Degradation in alkaline and acidic conditions

Ducom et al. investigated PDMS degradation in aqueous solutions of HNO3, HCl, NaOH,
Ca(OH)2 and demineralised water. PDMS exhibited maximal degradation at the highest
concentrations, i.e., in the most alkaline and acidic conditions. However, the degradation
levels were not the same for all solutions. In alkaline conditions, Ca(OH) 2 induced more
degradation compared to NaOH, regardless of pH value. This suggests that the nature of the
cations is significant in the degradation mechanism. The apparent catalytic behaviour of the
Ca2+-ion is consistent with the studies of catalysed PDMS degradation by clay minerals
discussed in chapter 2.2.1. Much like in the studies on environmental degradation, water
soluble hydrolysis products were observed to form in the Ca(OH)2 solution. These products
were assumed to be siloxanols or silanols. Regarding the acidic conditions, both HNO3 and
HCl induced similar degradation levels.26 The study, however, only analysed the total
amount of silicon released the PDMS into an aqueous phase, and the degradation products
and mechanism could therefore not be concluded.
The thermal degradation in presence of alkaline impurities, often found in polymerisation
catalysts for example, have also been studied. A TVA of a PDMS sample mixed with 5
weight-% of KOH demonstrated the threshold degradation temperature of PDMS to be
lowered by as much as 250 °C. Degradation products started to form at as low temperatures
as 187 °C. An Infrared (IR) spectroscopy determined these products to be predominantly
methane, suggesting a catalytic cleavage of Si-C bonds by KOH. Overall, the degradation
products are the same as with regular thermal degradation; a mixture of cyclic oligomers
with predominating and steadily decreasing amounts of D3, D4, etc. However, in a GasLiquid Chromatography (GLC) of PDMS that had been heated for 1.5 hours at 300 °C with 5
weight-% of KOH, trace amounts of minor products in addition to the cyclic oligomers were
detected. The most abundant of these products was determined to be the following structure
(X):

10

Oscar Nyman

__________________________________________________________________________

The proposed formation of X (Scheme 6) involves the formation of a siloxy ion (step 1). An
intramolecular reaction of this ion would then result in a cyclisation with a subsequent
formation of methane (step 2). A similar reaction with another siloxy ion then liberates
compound X from the polymer chain (step 3). These reactions would explain the formation
of methane. Since the regular cyclic oligomers are still formed, this must be a separate
reaction. It is suggested that the negatively charged hydroxyl ions from KOH is driving the
back-biting reactions from Scheme 2, thus destabilising the polymer.22

Scheme 6. Proposed formation of compound X.

An oxidative thermal degradation was also investigated in this study. The same crosslinking
behaviour as in the study by Camino et al. (mentioned in 2.2.2) was observed and the

11

Oscar Nyman

mechanism of its formation is suggested to be an intermolecular reaction with a siloxy ion,
similar to the mechanism for the formation of X (Scheme 7).22

2.2.4

Characterisation of silicones and their degradation products

The thermal degradation of polysiloxanes can be studied by TG analysis. TGA measures the
onset of weight loss or the amount of weight lost in the polymer at a fixed temperature. This
is a quantitative analysis, meaning it does not give information of the type of degradation
products that are volatilised.9 As earlier noted in chapter 2.2.2, whether or not the
atmosphere is inert will also result in highly different results.
For high MW polysiloxanes, high pressure size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC), also
known as gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is a useful analytical method. It separates
molecules based on size, providing molecular weight averages and size distribution
information of the polymer.9 This information makes it possible to investigate the
distribution and amount of degradation products of fully or partially degraded polymers, as
for example seen in this HP-SEC chromatogram (Figure 2), where the degradation of PDMS,
which has been loaded onto different clay types, can be observed. The numbers indicate
average molecular size of PDMS in the form of siloxane units.17

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) is often used to
determine total Si amount in samples. The method is very precise, Ducom et al. for example
achieved a detection limit of 0.0014 mg/l in their study of PDMS hydrolysis in controlled
aqueous solutions.26 Furthermore, by coupling the ICP with mass spectrometry (MS) instead
of OES, an even higher detection limit can be achieved.11
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is widely used method for the
identification of molecules in analytical chemistry. The 1H-NMR method is the most
common NMR method used to identify silicones. The protons on the methyl groups bonded
to silica have a very specific and low chemical shift located between 0 and 0,5 ppm, seen in
Figure 3. Therefore, the interference with signals of other functional groups within this range
is minimal, allowing for a highly specific analysis. Furthermore, it also allows for the

detection of different chain lengths and chain-end groups.27,28 The method can be
complemented with the quite insensitive

Si-NMR,

13

C-NMR methods, but for a slightly

more precise analysis, quantitative NMR (qNMR) can be employed for a more quantitative
analysis of PDMS, even in complex matrices.27

Gas chromatography (GC) is a separation technique suitable for smaller oligomers that can

can be separated by their retention times and then identified based on their mass. Another
detector that can be deployed is a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The FID measures the
ionisation current from ions that are formed by burning gaseous organic substances in an
oxyhydrogen flame surrounded by a high electric field.29
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is another method commonly used to
identify smaller oligomers. IR provides an adsorption spectrum of infrared frequencies that
can be ascribed to the bond between the silicon and other atoms or molecules. These spectra
can be compared to a reference spectrum, providing information of the molecular structure
of smaller siloxanes for example.30 An example of FTIR analysis of PDMS can be seen in a
study by Kaali et al. (2010), where the degradation of PDMS exposed to in vivo biofilms was
investigated. The FTIR results can be seen in Figure 4. The strongest peak at 787 cm-1
corresponds to Si–C stretching vibration, the peak between 1008 cm-1 and 1078 cm-1
corresponds to Si–O–Si stretching vibration, and bending and rocking vibrations of Si–CH3
can be observed at 1258 cm-1 and 864 cm-1, respectively. A peak between 3200 cm-1 and
3600 cm-1 corresponding to Si–OH bond vibrations had also formed in sample (b), which
indicated a hydrolysis of PDMS.31 However, due to overlapping peaks, this method might
not be suitable for the analysis of complex matrices, and the silicone must therefore be
separated beforehand.

2.3 Biorefining
2.3.1

Kraft pulping

Biorefining is the process of producing material, chemicals products and/or energy from
biomass and waste. The traditional papermaking industry has gone from simply making
paper to utilizing side streams and waste in biorefining processes.
Pulping is the process by which biomass such as wood or other fibrous mass is converted
into a pulp, which is a mass with liberated fibres. Pulp can be produced by chemical pulping,
semichemical pulping, chemimechanical pulping and mechanical pulping, with chemical
pulping being the most common method, accounting for 70% of worldwide production. The
typical pulping wood feedstock contains 40–45% cellulose, 25–35% hemicellulose, 20–30%
lignin and <5% extractives. The Kraft (sulphate) pulping process is the most common
process, making up for 90% of chemical pulping methods. In Kraft pulping, white liquor
(NaOH and Na2S) is used to digest, or “cook” the wood chips. The spent cooking liquor,
“black liquor” is separated from the pulp by washing and it is at this stage PDMS
antifoaming agents are added.9 The liquor is then concentrated to 65–80% solids content,
consisting of about 30% lignin, 30% aliphatic carboxylic acids, 7% other organics and 22%
inorganic compounds. Tall oil soap is formed from saponification reactions with the wood
extractives in the alkaline conditions and sodium salts are formed from the free acids. The
most common way to remove the tall oil soap is to let the black liquor settle in a soap tank,
remove black liquor from the bottom and remove the soap from the top by skimming. The
optimum for soap removal is at 28–32 weight-% dry solid content in the black liquor. At
lower percentages, the liquor is too diluted for efficient soap removal and at higher
percentages the viscosity prevents particles from rising.32,33 CTO is produced by acidulation
by H2SO4 at 93–97 °C in the following manner:
2RCOONa + H2SO4 → 2RCOOH + Na2SO4
Transforming the fatty and resin soaps (salt) into acids.33
The CTO comprises an acidic fraction with typically 40–60% resin acids and 30–50% free
fatty acids, and a neutral fraction with about 10–15% “unsaponifiables” that consists of
hydrocarbons, sterols, fatty alcohols etc.34,35 The CTO is normally distilled by vacuum
distillation at 3–30 mbar and 170–290 °C , yielding fatty acids (20–40%), light oil (10–
15%), resin acids (25–35%) and pitch residue (20–30%).8,32 The pitch residue, also known as
tall oil pitch (TOP), and light oil are often burned, while the other components are utilized in

the industry for several purposes such as detergents, drilling fluids, fungicides, lubricants
etc.33

2.3.2

Production of biodiesel from tall oil

The tall oil fatty acids (TOFA) recovered from the Kraft process can be further upgraded into
valuable chemicals such as lubricants and biodiesel. The term biodiesel most often refers to
long-chain fatty acid (m)ethyl esters (FAME) derived from renewable sources, traditionally
vegetable oils and animal fats but also tall oil.34,36
There are several different ways to produce biodiesel, the most common one being
transesterification. Transesterification is a reaction where a short-chain alcohol reacts with a
fat, such as triglyceride or oil, producing a mixture of fatty esters and glycerol (Scheme 8
and Scheme 9). A 3:1 stoichiometric ratio of alcohol and triglyceride is needed for a
complete transesterification; however, the reaction is reversible, therefore an excess of the
alcohol is used in order to shift the equilibrium towards the products. The alcohol is often
methanol or ethanol due to their availability and low cost, but especially methanol is
favoured because of its polarity, plus it has the shortest carbon chain and allows for quick
reactions with the triglycerides in the presence of alkaline catalysts. The reaction is more
often than not catalysed, either homogeneously or heterogeneously, with most commercial
biofuels using a base-catalysed homogeneous method. This method requires an anhydrous
alcohol, otherwise the presence of water will lead to partial saponification, producing soap,
which subsequently lowers the ester yield, deactivates catalysts, and causes problems at the
ester and glycerol separation stage. The purity of the feedstock is also of importance, as free
fatty acids (FFA) will also react with the base catalyst, causing saponification. “Lower
grade” unrefined oils with high amounts of FFA therefore benefit from an acid-catalysed
transesterification pre-treatment to lower FFA amounts, followed by a base-catalysed
transesterification.37–39 Both the base-catalysed and acid-catalysed reaction conditions are
relatively mild, with temperatures generally around 60–65 °C for the base-catalysed
transesterification and somewhat higher temperatures for the slower acid-catalysed
transesterification.40

Scheme 8. Simplified transesterification reaction.

Scheme 9. Transesterification of triglyceride with methanol.

The catalysed transesterification methods suffer from problems such as problematic
separation of products, need for feedstock with low FFA amounts, mixing problems etc. 38,41
Non-catalytic methods also exist. One example is the use of supercritical methanol. This
method allows for high amounts of FFA, which is beneficial since tall oil fatty acids can be
converted into biodiesel (FAME). However, the conditions are often quite extreme, with
temperatures upwards 350 °C.36

2.3.3

Upgrading and purification of biodiesel

Biodiesel, or FAME, has a high oxygen content, making it incompatible with most engines
as it damages seals in the fuel system and causes blockages and it must therefore be
upgraded.42 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a method of removing the oxygen from fatty
acids and triglycerides, producing n-aliphatic hydrocarbons, usually ranging from n-C15 to nC18 depending on the corresponding triglyceride. The method requires little investment as the
method is already used in the traditional petroleum industry to remove impurities such as
metals, sulphur and nitrogen from the petroleum-derived feedstock.38,43 The resulting fuel is
referred to as green diesel or renewable diesel, not to be confused with the oxygenated
biodiesel, and can be used in regular diesel engines. Typical catalysts for
hydrodeoxygenation are, for example, sulfided Ni-Mo or Co-Mo catalysts on porous

supports.42,44–46 After hydrogenation, lighter components are separated from the mid-distillate
using common fractionation methods.
The previously mentioned methods allow for the use of different kinds of feedstock,
including TOP, although it must be pre-treated and purified from impurities such as solid
particles and metals before hydrotreatment. In a previous study on the subject by Kenneth
Arandia, it was shown that TOP comprises mainly steryl esters, fatty acids, sterols and resin
acids.47 It might also contain traces of metal cations such as Ca, Fe, P, Al, Si and others. If
the purpose is to make renewable diesel, the TOP must be purified from these metal residues,
otherwise problems such as catalyst poisoning will occur in the upgrading processes.48 Other
possible impurities such as glycerol, water, soap, residual catalyst, and excess alcohol also
need to be removed. This is done either by wet or dry washing. Wet washing is the
traditional method, where hot water is introduced to dissolve the impurities, but the addition
of water leads to other problems such as the formation of soap and large volumes of
wastewater. Dry washing, which is done by introducing an adsorbent in a liquid-solid
adsorption process that removes these impurities could therefore be a better alternative.49–51

2.4 Objective
PDMS exhibits an onset degradation temperature in inert atmospheres at ~400 °C with
known degradation products, but in oxidizing, alkaline or acidic conditions or if the
degradation is otherwise catalysed, the onset degradation temperature can be lower than 300°
and the resulting degradation products might be very different. The high temperatures,
pressures, and feedstock-related conditions in the previously mentioned biorefining methods
are therefore likely to induce a catalytic effect on the degradation on PDMS.
The objective of this thesis was therefore to achieve a better understanding of the fate of
PDMS under industrially relevant conditions, such as possible degradation phenomena in
selected conditions and bio-oil matrixes. Furthermore, the objective included an evaluation
of a possible effect of an adsorbent on PDMS degradation in different matrixes.
The experimental work was to be carried out at Åbo Akademi University. The thermal
stability was to be analysed by HP-SEC analysis and degradation products were to be
analysed by ICP-OES, GC, GC-MS, and NMR.

3 EXPERIMENTAL
3.1 Experimental methods and instruments
3.1.1

Heating

The lower temperature experiments, with a maximum temperature at around 260 °C, were
conducted in a simple sand bath placed on a magnetic stirrer with a hot plate (Figure 5). The
plate was connected to a digital thermometer, which measured the temperature at the bottom
of the sand bath and adjusted the temperature to the desired temperature. The samples were
placed directly in the sand bath when the desired temperature had been reached and
remained stable.

Figure 5. Sand bath heating setup.

Oscar Nyman

__________________________________________________________________________
The higher temperature experiments were conducted in an autoclave capable of reaching
temperatures up to 300 °C (Figure 6). The reactor was connected to an argon tank, and
through the inlet (1) the inert gas was led into the reactor. The gas could then be released
through the outlet (4) to flush the reactor. Gas phase samples could be taken from the same
outlet if coupled to a gas sampling mechanism/syringe. The pressure in the reactor could be
read from the pressure gauge (6) but the reactor conditions were also measured with a
pressure sensor (7) and temperature sensor (8), which were then observed on a separate
display. The reactor was equipped with a curved turbine type stirrer/agitator (2). Samples
were taken from the sample collector (3), which consisted of a valve that led the reaction
mixture out from the reactor due to the overpressure inside the reactor. The heating was
achieved by an electrical heating clamp (5), which was placed around the steel pressure
reactor.

3.1.2

Extraction

Samples from the experiments were extracted using a hexane and methanol extraction
method described by Kennet Arandia in a previous study.52 First, samples weighing 250 mg
were prepared. Then, 4 ml methanol, 4 ml hexane and 100 µl 25%-ammonia solution was
added to the samples. The samples were then vortexed for about 1 minute and later
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm. The solution was allowed to settle and the top phase
(hexane), containing PDMS and some components from the bio-oil matrix, is transferred to
another tube using a pipette. Another 4 ml of hexane is added for a double extraction and the
procedure was repeated. The solvent was then evaporated in an evaporator and the samples
were further prepared for analysis.

3.1.3

Analysis methods and materials

A high MW silicone oil acquired from Sigma Aldrich, with a viscosity of 1000 cst, was used.
The selected bio-oil samples and adsorbent were acquired from Finnish industrial
companies.
HP-SEC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10AT liquid chromatograph with a
Sedex 85 LT-ELSD (Low-Temperature Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector). The
columns consisted of a Jordi Gel DVB 500Å 50 x 7.8 mm guard column and two Jordi Gel
DVB 500Å 300 x 7.8 mm columns. A HPLC-grade THF eluent with 1% glacial acetic acid
was used with the sensitivity value Gain 3. The injection volume was 50 μl with a flow rate
of 0.8 ml/min. Before analysis, the samples were diluted to either 3 or 5 mg/ml in THF.
From there, 1 ml of sample was transferred and filtered through 0.2 μm PTFE filters into
HPLC/GC autosampler glass vials.
NMR analyses were conducted on two different instruments, both with Bruker 500 MHz
actively shielded magnets and probes with automatic tuning and matching. The first
instrument was equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled Prodigy BBO CryoProbe and the
other with a BB/1H Smartprobe. Samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform and
diluted to 25–50 mg/ml.
GC-MS analyses were run on an Agilent 6890 series GC coupled with a HP 5973 MS
detector using an Agilent 19091Z-002 HP-1 methyl siloxane capillary column. Some
samples were silylated using a silylation mixture consisting of pyridine, BSTFA and TMCS
in the ratio 1:4:1. About 150 μl of this mixture is then added to the extract and gently shaken.

23

Oscar Nyman
Master’s thesis (M. Sc. Eng.)
__________________________________________________________________________
The sample were then placed in an oven for 45 minutes at 70 °C and vortexed after about 5
minutes of heating.
For short- and long column GC-FID analyses, Clarus 500 Gas Chromatograph and
Autosystem XL gas chromatographs from Perkin Elmer were employed. The long column
used was a HP-1 Agilent Narrowbore GC column with a length of 25 m and an internal
diameter of 0.2 mm. The short column was an Agilent J&W Megabore GC column with a
length of 6 m and an internal diameter of 0.53 mm.

3.2 Preliminary experiments
Preliminary experiments were conducted to achieve an insight into the degradation
phenomena of PDMS at a broad level. The information obtained was then used to determine
the relevant conditions for the main experiments.

3.2.1

Heating of pure PDMS

The first preliminary experiment that was conducted was a simple heating and later
extraction of pure PDMS. This was done to see if there are any signs of degradation of
PDMS at 250 °C, and to test the methanol-hexane extraction method described in 3.1.2. The
experiment was carried out in a closed system consisting of two test tubes (A and B), which
were placed in a simple autoclave flushed with nitrogen. An untreated sample C was also
prepared for reference. The autoclave was placed in a sand bath that had been heated up to
around 210 °C. Test tube A and C contained 250 mg of PDMS, and test tube B contained
250 mg of PDMS and about 1 weight-% of 85% phosphoric acid. After 20 minutes the
temperature of the sand reached around 240 °C and was kept at this level for 3 hours. After
these 3 hours the autoclave was removed and allowed to cool for about 15 minutes in room
temperature and subsequently opened. The phosphoric acid had unfortunately not been in
contact with the PDMS and was instead stuck on the side of the tube. The samples were first
weighed, and as expected they showed no weight loss and thus no degradation and formation
of volatile species. The PDMS was then extracted from the samples using the hexane and
methanol extraction method. Weighing revealed that over 99% of the PDMS was extracted
using the method.

3.2.2

Heating of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix

A second experiment was conducted to see if the degradation behaviour is different for
PDMS in a bio-oil matrix at similar temperatures as the first experiment. Two mixtures A
and B with 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 1 totalling 250 mg were prepared. Mixture A was
heated in a sealed nitrogen flushed Ace glass pressure tube directly placed sand bath for 3
hours at temperatures between 250 °C and 260 °C. Mixture B was untreated for reference.
Both mixtures were extracted using the hexane-methanol method. The hexane phases in A
and B were evaporated and collected for preparation for HP-SEC analysis, where the
mixtures were dissolved in 10 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF) and later diluted to 5 mg/ml. The
solutions were then filtrated and analysed by HP-SEC. After this, another experiment in the
same conditions was conducted for later NMR analysis.

3.2.3

Catalytic efficiency of bio-oil 1 on PDMS degradation

After getting the results of the second experiment, a third experiment was conducted; this
time with 250 mg samples of 20% bio-oil 1 and 80% PDMS. This would potentially give
more information on the catalytic ability of bio-oil 1 on PDMS degradation. Four samples
were prepared. The First sample (A) was an untreated reference sample that was not heated.
The three other samples (B, C and D) were flushed with nitrogen in Ace pressure tubes,
sealed and placed in a sand bath at around 260 °C. Sample B was removed after 45 minutes,
sample C at 83 minutes and lastly sample D after 3 hours of reaction time. After
fractionation, the hexane phase was collected, evaporated, and later prepared for HP-SEC
analysis by dilution with THF to a concentration of 3 mg/ml.

3.3 Thermal degradation of PDMS
3.3.1

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix with long residence time

Samples containing a 250 mg mixture of 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 1 were prepared in
Ace glass pressure tubes, which were then flushed with nitrogen and sealed. The samples
were placed in a sand bath at 250 °C for 3 hours under constant stirring with magnets. After
3 hours had passed the samples were cooled to room temperature in a water bath. Sample A
was directly dissolved in THF for HP-SEC analysis and sample B was fractionated and
dissolved in THF for HP-SEC analysis. All HP-SEC samples were diluted to 3 mg/ml in
THF. Sample A and B were also analysed using short column GC. Samples C and D were
25

Oscar Nyman
Master’s thesis (M. Sc. Eng.)
__________________________________________________________________________
dissolved in chloroform for NMR analysis, where sample D was spiked with D3 and D4
cyclosiloxanes for comparison. Unheated reference samples containing the same amount of
PDMS and bio-oil were made for both HP-SEC and NMR. Pure PDMS and bio-oil was also
analysed for comparison.

3.3.2

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix with shorter residence time

Samples containing a 250 mg mixture of 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 1 were prepared in
argon flushed and sealed Ace glass pressure tubes. The samples were then heated to 250 °C
for 30, 60 and 90 minutes in a sand bath under constant stirring and subsequently
fractionated with the hexane-methanol dissolution method. The samples were then placed in
a vacuum oven at 40 °C for a couple of days and then diluted to 3 mg/ml in THF for HPSEC analysis.

3.3.3

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 2 matrix

In order to gain a better understanding of the catalysed degradation of PDMS, another
similar matrix, bio-oil 2, was used instead of bio-oil 1. Samples containing 250 mg of 20%
PDMS and 80% bio-oil 2 were prepared in argon flushed and sealed Ace glass pressure
tubes. Sample A was untreated for reference and samples B, C and D were heated to 250 °C
in a sand bath for 30, 60 and 90 minutes, respectively. After the reaction, the samples were
cooled to room temperature in a water bath. All samples were then fractionated using the
hexane-methanol dissolution method. Sample C was unfortunately destroyed during
extraction and only samples A, B and D were collected for HP-SEC preparation. After
evaporation of the hexane phase in a rotary evaporator the samples were placed in an oven at
40 °C at atmospheric pressure over the weekend to ensure that the hexane had fully
evaporated. The samples were then diluted to 3 mg/ml in THF and analysed using HP-SEC.
Solid particles were observed in the THF solution, and the samples were therefore placed in
an ultrasonic bath for a few seconds to dissolve the solid material.

3.3.4

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 3 matrix

The same experiment as in 3.3.3 was conducted again, only with the slight difference that
bio-oil 3 was used instead of bio-oil 2. Samples A, B, C and D were placed in an oven at
40 °C at atmospheric pressure over the weekend to evaporate the hexane. The samples were
26

Oscar Nyman
Master’s thesis (M. Sc. Eng.)
__________________________________________________________________________
diluted to 3 mg/ml in THF and analysed using HP-SEC. Pure, untreated bio-oil 3 and heated
bio-oil 3 was also analysed as a reference.

3.3.5

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 4 matrix

Five samples containing 250 mg of 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 4 were prepared in Ace
pressure tubes, which were flushed with argon and sealed. The first sample was not heated
and used as a reference, while the other four were heated in a sand bath to 250 °C for 30, 60,
90 and 120 minutes respectively. The samples were then cooled down to room temperature
in a water bath and later fractionated using the hexane-methanol dissolution method. All
samples were placed in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight and later diluted to 3 mg/ml in
THF and prepared for HP-SEC analysis.

3.3.6

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix in an autoclave

A 50 ml mixture of roughly 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 1 was weighed up and transferred
to an autoclave reactor. The autoclave was flushed and later filled with argon to an
overpressure of 10 psi (~0.7 Bar). The overpressure is needed in order to take samples from
the autoclave during the experiment. The heating was then turned on and a stirring speed of
850 rpm was applied to ensure proper mixing. The heating curve and pressure increase
during the experiment was monitored and can be seen in Figure 7. The first sample was
taken at 10 minutes during the initial heating phase at 225 °C as a reference. Another sample
was taken at 20 minutes when the temperature in the reactor had reached the desired 280 °C.
The next 4 samples were then taken every 30 minutes after the 20-minute mark and the final
sample was taken after the reactor had cooled down.
The sample sizes were between 600 mg and 1.4 g; therefore, the fractionation was done in
larger scale separatory funnels with 15 (+15) ml hexane, 15 ml methanol and 300 µl 25%ammonia solution. The hexane phases from the samples were collected, transferred to
smaller test tubes, and evaporated. The samples were then placed in a 40 °C vacuum oven
overnight to ensure complete evaporation of the solvent.

3.4 Adsorbent effect on degradation
3.4.1

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 3 with adsorbent

A silicon-based adsorbent is often introduced before hydrotreatment in industrial processes,
and its effect on PDMS degradation was therefore tested. In the first experiment, 250 mg
samples of PDMS mixed in a bio-oil 3 matrix with a ratio of 20:80 were prepared in Ace
pressure tubes. One weight-% of adsorbent was then added to the samples. The tubes were
flushed with argon, sealed, and subsequently heated to 250 °C under constant stirring in a
sand bath. The first sample was removed after 30 minutes and the second after 60 minutes.
An untreated reference sample was also prepared.
After the reaction, the samples were extracted using the methanol and hexane extraction
method. After collecting the hexane phase and evaporating the solvent, the samples were
placed in a 40 °C vacuum oven overnight. The samples were then diluted to 3 mg/ml in THF
for HP-SEC analysis.

3.4.2

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 with an adsorbent

The same experimental method and setup as 3.4.1 was deployed in this experiment, only this
time bio-oil 1 was used as matrix instead of bio-oil 3. The samples were diluted to 3 mg/ml
in THF for HP-SEC analysis.

3.5 PDMS degradation products in bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4 and the effect
of Calcium ions
3.5.1

PDMS degradation products in bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4

A simple heating experiment of two 250 mg samples, one containing 20% PDMS and 80%
bio-oil 3 and the other 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 4 was conducted in order to detect
PDMS degradation products in these matrixes using GC-MS and GC-FID. The samples were
filled with argon, sealed, and then placed in a sand bath at 250 °C under constant stirring for
90 minutes.

3.5.2

Calcium ion effect on PDMS degradation in bio-oil 2

As the matrixes containing the most cations such as calcium and sodium showed the fastest
degradation, and as the catalytic effect of calcium ions has been described in literature, the
effect of calcium ions on PDMS degradation was tested. Bio-oil 2 was chosen as a matrix as
it did not show any significant degradation in the earlier experiments. Two samples
containing 250 mg of 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 2 were prepared, and 5 µl distilled water
was added to the first sample while 5 µl of 5 mg/ml CaCl2 (0,025 mg) was added to the
other. The two samples were filled with argon, sealed, and heated in a sand bath at 250 °C
under constant stirring for 90 minutes. The samples were then diluted to 3 mg/ml in THF and
prepared for HP-SEC analysis.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Preliminary experiments
4.1.1

Heating of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix

The initial experiment (3.2.1) where pure PDMS was heated to 240 °C showed no
degradation as expected, as the onset degradation temperature in inert atmospheres is
somewhere around 400 °C. In this experiment, where PDMS was heated in a bio-oil 1
matrix, at least some degradation was expected to occur in accordance with the studies
conducted by Anton Örn.52 Therefore, an initial residence time of 3 hours in the reactor was
chosen to ensure that the HP-SEC results would indicate some degradation.
High MW PDMS elutes at around 14 minutes, while the bio-oil 1 components will show up
between 19 and 23 minutes. In the resulting HP-SEC chromatogram (Figure 8), practically
all of the initial high MW PDMS was degraded into presumably smaller components after 3
hours of residence time. In this chromatogram, only the steryl esters at around 20 minutes
were seen from the bio-oil 1 components, as the other components were transferred to the
methanol phase during the extraction.

4.1.2

Catalytic efficiency of bio-oil 1 on PDMS degradation

As a catalytic effect of bio-oil 1 on PDMS degradation could be demonstrated in the
previous experiment, this experiment was conducted to obtain a picture of to what extent
bio-oil 1 catalyses the degradation.
With 80% PDMS and 20% bio-oil 1, the resulting HP-SEC chromatogram (Figure 9) showed
a clear degradation of the high MW PDMS, with the elution peak at 14 minutes decreasing
and shifting to the right with increased time. The large spike visible at the beginning of the
high MW PDMS peak is caused by the initial analyte not interacting with the column as it
should, giving a sharp elution peak of molecules that have no retention in the columns. This
phenomenon can be seen in all of the chromatograms. The shift towards the right indicated a
shortening of the polymer chain, however, large amounts of high MW PDMS were still
detectable, even after 3 hours of residence time at 260 °C, suggesting that larger amounts of
bio-oil 1 are required for the high MW PDMS to fully degrade, even with long residence
times.

4.2 Thermal degradation of PDMS
4.2.1

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix with long residence time

Similarly to the preliminary heating experiment 3.2.2, this experiment involved heating
PDMS in bio-oil 1 in a 20:80 ratio to 250 °C for 3 hours. This was done in order to try and
replicate the results from the previous experiment, introduce stirring of the mixture for more
representative results, compare fractionated and extracted samples from unfractionated ones,
and to try and identify the degradation products.
The HP-SEC chromatogram of the unfractionated samples (Figure 10) shows both PDMS
and all the bio-oil components. The steryl esters eluted at 20 minutes and the fatty- and resin
acids eluted at around 22 and 23 minutes. Here, the high MW PDMS at 14 minutes again
seems to have fully degraded into smaller components. In contrast, the HP-SEC results of the
more concentrated and fractionated samples (Figure 11) showed that there was still about
20% of the original amount of high MW PDMS left after 3 hours, calculated from the peak
areas. This might be due to unreacted PDMS that has not been in contact with the bio-oil or
simply due to differences in concentration. Both samples show that degradation is clearly
occurring, but in order to gain a more complete understanding of the fate of PDMS, the use
of the hexane-methanol fractionation method is preferable.

A short column GC analysis was also conducted on an unfractionated sample and on the
hexane phase of a fractionated sample. Both samples were silylated using the method
described in 3.1.3. In the resulting chromatograms (Figure 12), the unfractionated sample is
depicted in black and the fractionated sample in blue. The peaks at 18–21 min are steryl
esters, the peaks at 5.2–6.6 minutes are fatty acids and the peaks at 6.6–8 minutes are resin
acids. Both the fatty acids and resin acids have mostly disappeared in the fractionated
sample. This is because they form salts with the ammonia solution and end up in the
methanol phase. What is interesting is the peak at around 3 minutes. This is an unknown
peak which is not present in pure bio-oil 1 chromatograms and could therefore be of interest.

An NMR analysis on the heated PDMS + bio-oil 1 sample (green) was conducted and
compared to a sample of PDMS + bio-oil 1 spiked with D3 and D4 cyclosiloxanes (red). The
results from the 1H-NMR (Figure 13) show that D3 and D4 have formed as degradation
products from high MW PDMS. The NMR results are also consistent with literature

discussed in 2.2.4, where the chemical shift of D3 and D4 is said to be at around 0.17 and 0.9
ppm, respectively. The coupling from the siloxane chain is expected to be at around 0.075
ppm.29 In this spectra, a peak can be seen at 0.07–0.08 ppm which potentially could be from
the siloxane chain or some other degradation products. By running a sample of pure high
MW PDMS (blue), the siloxane chain could be observed at around 0.07–0.08 ppm, although
the concentration of the sample was somewhat high for a more exact chemical shift.

4.2.2

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix with shorter residence time

In industrial processes, the residence times in the reactors are typically shorter than three
hours. The thermal degradation of PDMS in a bio-oil 1 matrix with shorter residence times
was therefore investigated. Residence times of 30, 60 and 90 minutes where chosen and
samples with 20% PDMS and 80% bio-oil 1 were heated to 250 °C. The samples where
fractionated using the hexane-methanol dissolution method.
The HP-SEC results can be seen in Figure 14. After only 30 minutes, the high MW PDMS
peak at around 14 minutes has flattened and shifted to the right, meaning it has started to

degrade. After 90 minutes, practically all of the high MW PDMS was degraded (Figure 15)
and signals from smaller components seen between 15 and 18 minutes in the HP-SEC
chromatogram were increased. There is, however, an overlap between the bio-oil 1
components that start to elute at around 18 minutes and the formed degradation products,
making it difficult to distinguish the elution time of the final degradation products.

4.2.3

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 2 matrix

At this point, some of the possible degradation products of PDMS in bio-oil 1 have been
observed, namely D3 and D4. However, the cause and the mechanism of this catalytic
behaviour was still unknown. Therefore, the thermal degradation of PDMS in 3 other
selected bio-oils, bio-oil 1, bio-oil 2 and bio-oil 3, was investigated as a comparison. If the
effect is the same, the catalytic effect must be due to some components that are present in all
of these matrices.
The resulting HP-SEC chromatogram from the heating of PDMS in bio-oil 2 (Figure 16)
indicated that some degradation of high MW PDMS is taking place, as the elution peak at
around 14 minutes was gradually becoming smaller. However, the degradation was not very
significant, with a decrease of only 10 weight-% high MW PDMS after 90 minutes (Figure
17). The high MW PDMS peak did not seem to shift to the right as much as in the
experiments with bio-oil 1 either. This suggested that a component not present in bio-oil 2
was causing the catalytic effect of bio-oil 1.
Something else that could be observed was the elution peak at 18 minutes which was
increased with time. This was probably due to triglycerides from bio-oil 2 that were
polymerizing. This would also explain the formation of larger particles, which were seen in
the THF solution when preparing the samples for HP-SEC.

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 3 matrix

The thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 3 (Figure 18) yielded different results compared
to those of PDMS in bio-oil 2, even though their compositions are similar. In the HP-SEC
results, degradation of PDMS was again observed from the elution peak at 14 minutes which
was both decreasing and shifting to the right with increased residence time. The degradation
was significant, albeit slightly slower than in the bio-oil 1 matrix, with a peak area decrease
of ~35% and height decrease of 70% after 90 minutes (Figure 19). There was still a large
number of products high MW compounds that eluted at 14–15 minutes even after 90 min of
residence time, whereas in bio-oil 1 there were practically none. These findings suggest that
either the catalytic component is limited in this matrix, or that another, slower degradation
mechanism is taking place in the bio-oil 3 matrix compared to the other matrices.

and 17 minutes, reinforcing the suspicion that the products of intermediate size in Figure 18

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 4 matrix

The thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 4 (Figure 21) was similar to that of PDMS in
bio-oil 1, but at an even faster rate. The chromatogram showed clear degradation of PDMS
with the elution peak of high MW PDMS at 14 minutes decreasing in size and shifting to the
right with time. Already after 60 minutes, all of the high MW PDMS has degraded into
smaller components, presumably the same components as in bio-oil 1. The degradation
kinetics can be seen in Figure 22.
Note that the scale is not the same as in the other HP-SEC chromatograms. The bio-oil 4
components were easier to separate from PDMS compared to previous experiments and the
samples were therefore more concentrated.

Thermal degradation of PDMS in bio-oil 1 matrix in an autoclave

As the temperatures in the industrial processes often exceed 250 °C, the degradation was
investigated in larger scale (50 ml) and at higher temperature.
The HP-SEC analysis for the scaled-up autoclave reactor experiment at 280 °C (Figure 23)
resulted in clear signs of degradation with the elution peak at 14 minutes growing gradually
smaller and shifting slightly to the right with increased reaction time. The degradation
looked very similar to the small-scale reactions at 250 °C, and a complete degradation of the
high MW PDMS was observed after 120 minutes (Figure 24).
Sample A was taken at 225 °C before the reactor had reached 280 °C and was larger than the
other samples (~1.2 g compared to ~600 mg). Sample B, on the other hand, was taken as
soon as the temperature reached 280 °C, followed by a sample every 30 minutes (C, D, E
and F) and the last sample (G) after the reaction had cooled down. This sample size
difference might have affected the workup, causing peak A to show as slightly smaller than
peak B in the chromatogram.

A 1H-NMR analysis of sample G was compared to D3, D4 and PDMS, which can be seen in
Figure 25. Due to the very specific chemical shifts of organosilicon compounds with methyl
groups, the presence of D3 and D4 can clearly be observed on 1H-NMR. The results were
also in accordance with those of literature. The peak at 0.8 ppm does not entirely match with
the PDMS peak, suggesting the presence of other silicon compounds.

43

Oscar Nyman

Sample G was also analysed using GC-MS, both unsilylated and silylated. The results are
shown in Figure 26 and Figure 27. Not only could D3 and D4 be detected, but an entire
range of cyclosiloxanes, ranging from D3 to D8. However, D3 was not visible in Figure 26
or Figure 27, because it eluted before 3 minutes.

The same thing could be observed from a long-column GC-FID analysis (Figure 28). Here
the relative amounts can be seen more clearly, and by comparing the result to a known
amount of D4, the following distribution could be calculated:

Compound
D3
D4
D5
D6
D7
D8

Weight-% of
total sample
0.93%
8.78%
3.75%
0.89%
0.17%
0.05%
14.57%

D4 is the most abundant product at 8.78%, followed by D5 at 3.75%, D3 at 0,93 and
decreasing amounts of D6–D8. These cyclosiloxanes are probably giving rise to the
unknown peak in the NMR spectrum. The presence of these degradation products also
indicates the mechanism of degradation, as these products are the same products that form
from the back-biting reactions described in 2.2.2. The fact that D4 is the most is the abundant
product, and not D3, might be related to the size of the catalytic component. If the reaction is
in fact metal catalysed, and thus cation dependent, which was suggested in 2.2.3, then it
could be entirely possible that metal residues in bio-oil 1 are driving the reaction by
cyclisation of the siloxane chain for these back-biting reactions. D3 cyclosiloxane rings
could in that case be too small for a cation to fit inside. Another thing to note is that some of
the D3 could potentially be lost from evaporation during the split injection to the GC,
however, NMR results confirm that D4 is nonetheless more abundant.
To confirm these results, the same sample was analysed with ICP-MS. The total amount of
silicon in the sample was determined to be 5.6%. If we assume that most of the products are
in the form of D4, the amount of silicon can be calculated by dividing the total MW of
silicon in D4 with the total MW of D4 in the following manner:

This can then be multiplied to the amount of cyclosiloxanes detected in the GC-FID to yield
the total amont of silicon:
0.378748 ∗ 14.57% ≈ 5.52%
45

This is in agreement with the 5.6% detected by the ICP-MS, confirming the accuracy of the
results.

degradation behaviour were observed from the HP-SEC chromatogram of PDMS in bio-oil 3
with an adsorbent (Figure 29). The results are presented on top of each other in Figure 30,

PDMS degradation products in bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4

In the experiments with PDMS in bio-oil 1, cyclic oligomers had been detected, suggesting
that the dominating mechanisms of degradation are the back-biting reactions (Scheme 10),
either from the chain end (1) or from folding of the polysiloxane chain (2).

Scheme 10. Polysiloxane back-biting reactions.

To find out if this is the dominating mechanism in the other matrixes as well, a heating
experiment of PDMS in bio-oil 3 and in bio-oil 4 was conducted. Analysis of the degradation
products was done using GC-MS and GC-FID. In the GC-FID results (Figure 33), the two
chromatograms are overlaid one another, with the topmost chromatograph representing
PDMS in bio-oil 4 and the bottommost graph representing PDMS in bio-oil 3. The results
show that also in bio-oil 4, cyclosiloxanes ranging from D3–D8 are formed as degradation
products. Trace amounts of these cyclosiloxanes were also detected in bio-oil 3. The
percentage of cyclosiloxanes, based on GC-FID peak areas, are the following:

These amounts do not quite add up to the 20% of PDMS the sample was loaded with. The
most probable cause for this is due to the relatively short reaction time of 90 minutes,
meaning some high to medium-weight PDMS might still be present in sample. However, it
could also be due to some other competing mechanism that forms other compounds. If the
latter is the case, one reason for why these compounds have not been detected could be due
to the preparation of the samples. The samples are dissolved in hexane for GC analysis,
meaning possible water-soluble products that might have formed will not show in these
chromatograms.

The GC-MS analysis (Figure 34) did not yield very reliable results, as several components
had more or less identical mass spectra, but some of the cyclosiloxanes were detected.

Since there is no way of seeing any water-soluble products that may have formed in this
experiment, one cannot conclude that the cyclosiloxanes ranging from D3 to D8 are the only
degradation products with 100% certainty, however, for PDMS in bio-oil 4, the formation of
significant amounts of them have at least been observed, and the degradation mechanism
would then be the same as to that of PDMS in bio-oil 1. Only trace amounts of the
cyclosiloxanes were detected in the PDMS + bio-oil 3 sample and no conclusion can
therefore be drawn based on this experiment alone. One would instead have to repeat the
experiment with a longer residence time in the reactor, and potential water-soluble products
would also have to be analysed.

4.2.10 Calcium-ion effect on PDMS degradation in bio-oil 2
The driving force for the degradation can be speculated from the composition of the different
matrixes, especially the difference between bio-oil 1, bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4, who all induced
degradation, and bio-oil 2, which did not induce any significant degradation.
The most relevant differences in the compositions can be seen from ICP-MS and GPC
results presented in Table 4. Firstly, sodium levels for the bio-oil 1 and bio-oil 4 samples
51

were roughly 56 and 36 times higher (respectively) than in bio-oil 2 and bio-oil 3. Secondly,
calcium was found in bio-oil 1, which had the highest amount, and in bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4,
but not in bio-oil 2. Regarding the composition, bio-oil 1, bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4 had a much
higher number of fatty acids than bio-oil 2. Furthermore, bio-oil 1 and bio-oil 4, both of
which induced the highest degradation, contained resin acids, which were also not found in
bio-oil 2.

The driving force behind these back-biting reactions in the matrixes was therefore
hypothesised to be either the cations such as Na+ and Ca2+, or reactions involving the free
fatty and/or resin acids.
The effect of calcium ions was tested by adding 100 ppm of CaCl2 dissolved in distilled
water to a sample of PDMS and bio-oil 2 and comparing it to another sample of PDMS and
bio-oil 2 with the same amount of distilled water (5 µl) without CaCl2 added. The samples
were then heated for 90 minutes and the resulting HP-SEC chromatogram can be seen in

conclusions cannot be drawn from this single experiment alone, as factors such as the
number of Ca-ions, the addition of water and human errors might have influenced the results,
but the findings suggest that it is rather the fatty and/or resin acids components that catalyse
the degradation of PDMS, and not the cations.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The degradation of high MW PDMS at elevated temperatures in renewable oils has been
investigated and analysed by HP-SEC, NMR, GC-FID, GC-MS and ICP-MS. A degradation
was observed in all matrices using HP-SEC; however, the fastest reaction rates, calculated by
peak areas in HP-SEC chromatograms, were observed in bio-oil 4 and bio-oil 1. In the biooil 4 matrix, all the high MW PDMS had degraded into smaller products after 60 minutes of
residence time in a reactor at 250 °C. For PDMS in bio-oil 1, the same thing could be
observed after 90 minutes, whereas in bio-oil 3 only around 35% had degraded after 90
minutes, and in bio-oil 2 merely 10%. No increase in the degradation rate was observed for
PDMS in bio-oil 1 after elevating the temperature to 280 °C in an autoclave reactor.
The degradation products of PDMS in bio-oil 1, after over 120 minutes of heating at 280 °C,
were analysed by NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS, and GC-FID. The main degradation products
of PDMS were found to be cyclosiloxanes ranging from D3-D5, and decreasing numbers of
D6-D8, suggesting that the degradation mechanisms are the same back-biting reactions seen
in the thermal degradation of PDMS. The accuracy of the experiment was affirmed by
comparing the amount of cyclosiloxanes that had formed in the sample, which was about
14.6 weight-%, to the total amount of silicon in the same sample, which in turn had been
determined by ICP-MS.
The same cyclosiloxanes were also detected for PDMS in a bio-oil 4 matrix after heating for
90 minutes. The amount of cyclosiloxanes was calculated by peak areas in GC-FID and
determined to be about 6.9 weight-%, after initially loading the sample with 20 weight-%
high MW PDMS. Due to the relatively short residence time in the reactor, the remaining
products were most likely medium weight PDMS polymer and oligomers that had not yet
fully degraded. However, the possibility of potential water-soluble degradation products
forming cannot be completely ruled out, as the GC samples were dissolved in hexane,
meaning water-soluble compounds were not detected.
An adsorbent was also introduced in mixtures of PDMS in bio-oil 1 and PDMS in bio-oil 3.
These were heated for 60 minutes at 250 °C and later analysed using HP-SEC. The results
showed that the introduction of the adsorbent did not influence the degradation of PDMS.
The driving force for the degradation, or the catalytic component in the matrices, were
hypothesised to be either cations or the fatty and/or resin acids. These compounds were
hypothesised to be driving the back-biting reactions since the degradation rate of PDMS was
increased with increasing amounts of these compounds. Furthermore, the effect of cations
and acids on PDMS degradation can also be found in literature. The effect of Ca2+-ions was
54

Oscar Nyman
Master’s thesis (M. Sc. Eng.)
__________________________________________________________________________
tested by dissolving CaCl2 in distilled water (a total of 100 ppm) and adding it to a sample of
PDMS in a bio-oil 2 matrix. The same amount of distilled water was added to a reference
sample to rule out the influence of water. Both samples were then heated to 250 °C for 90
minutes. No difference in degradation rates was observed, suggesting that the fatty and/or
resin acids are catalysing the degradation of PDMS.
For further studies on this subject, I suggest repeating the degradation experiments of PDMS
in bio-oil 3 and bio-oil 4, except with longer residence times in the reactor for the PDMS to
fully degrade into its final products. Here one could also analyse water-soluble products and
rule out other competing degradation mechanisms if none are found. The catalytic effect of
acids could also be investigated further by introducing organic acids to PDMS in different
matrices. These would preferably then be acids that are similar to the fatty and resin acids,
such as butyric acid or larger carboxylic acids, in order for the experiment to be as
representative as possible.

6 SAMMANFATTNING PÅ SVENSKA
6.1 Nedbrytning av polydimetylsiloxan i simulerade, industriella
processförhållanden
Kisel (Si) är det 14:e grundämnet i det periodiska systemet och det näst vanligaste
grundämnet på jorden efter syre. Silikon, eller polysiloxan, är en hydrofobisk polymer som
består av alternerande syre- och kiselatomer med organiska föreningar bundna till
kiselatomerna, vanligtvis metylgrupper. De långa och flexibla bindningarna i den
repeterande Si-O-strukturen ger upphov till unika egenskaper, såsom låg värmekänslighet
och låg ytspänning vid gränsytor. Den senare nämnda egenskapen har lett till att den använts
som ett skumdämpningsmedel i flera industriella applikationer. I sulfatprocessen, vid
framställning av pappersmassa, impregnerar man träet med s.k. vitlut, bestående av
natriumsulfid (Na2S) och natriumhydroxid (NaOH), vid höga temperaturer i en kokare. Vid
kokningen frigörs cellulosafibrer från ligninet, och estrar från fettsyror, hartssyror och
steroler i träet börjar brytas ner och bilda ytaktiva molekyler. Blandningen av tillsatta
kemikalier och upplöst trä kallas svartlut och den separeras från pappersmassan
(cellulosafibrerna) genom tvättning. De ytaktiva molekylerna genererar stora mängder skum
under tvättningen av pappersmassan och därför tillsätts polydimetylsiloxan (PDMS) som
skumdämpare. Efter tvättningen tillåts svartluten sätta sig, och såpa, bestående av fettsyror,
lägger sig på ytan av svartluten, varefter den kan skrapas bort. Såpan tas tillvara och
neutraliseras med svavelsyra för att bilda tallolja. Talloljan kan sedan vidare destilleras och
förädlas till nya produkter. Den har bland annat visat sig vara ett billigt och hållbart
alternativ till diverse biooljor för dieseltillverkning i oljeraffineringsindustrin.
Problemet är att man funnit spår av PDMS i talloljan i form av cykliska siloxaner och
högmolekylär PDMS, vilket har kommit med vidare i förädlingsprocessen efter att ha tillsatts
som skumdämpningsmedel. Denna PDMS har lett till problem i oljeraffinaderier i form av
fast avlagring och katalysatorförgiftning under hydrogeneringsprocessen. Målet med denna
avhandling var därför att ta reda på hur stabilt PDMS är i industriellt relevanta förhållanden,
bland annat vid höjda temperaturer och i blandningar av olika biooljor, samt att ta reda på
dess slutliga sönderfallsprodukter. Experimenten utfördes vid Åbo Akademi i autoklav eller i
stängda, värme- och trycktåliga glastuber i inert atmosfär som värmdes upp i ett sandbad
med värmeplatta och magnetomrörare. Analysmetoderna som användes var HP-SEC, NMR,
GC-MS, GC-FID och ICP-MS.
Uträknat från toppareorna i HP-SEC-kromatogrammen konstaterades att PDMS bryts ner
snabbast i bioolja 4 och bioolja 1, följt av bioolja 3, och allra minst i bioolja 2. Efter 60
56

Oscar Nyman
Master’s thesis (M. Sc. Eng.)
__________________________________________________________________________
minuter i en 20:80 blandning av PDMS och bioolja 4 vid 250 °C hade all högmolekylär
PDMS brutits ner till mellanmolekylära polymerer samt mindre oligomerer och
sönderfallsprodukter. Samma kunde konstateras för PDMS i bioolja 1 efter 90 minuter. För
PDMS i bioolja 3 hade ca 35 % högmolekylärt PDMS brutits ner efter 90 minuter och i
bioolja 2 endast ca 10%, vilket tydde på att en lägre mängd av den katalytiska komponenten i
bioolja 3 och bioolja 2.
Sönderfallsprodukterna analyserades med hjälp av NMR, GC-MS och GC-FID. För fallet
PDMS i bioolja 1 kunde det konstateras att PDMS bryts ner till cykliska siloxaner i
storleksordningen

D3–D8

(hexametylcyklotrisiloxan–hexadekametylcyklooctasiloxan),

varav den största andelen var D3–D5. Cyklosiloxanernas viktprocent beräknades från GCFID-resultaten genom att jämföra toppareorna med topparean från en känd mängd D4.
Viktprocenten jämfördes sedan med den totala mängden kisel i provet, vilket hade
analyserats med ICP-MS. Resultaten stämde överens. D3–D8 bildades även för fallet PDMS
i bioolja 4. Här stämde dock mängderna inte överens, vilket kan förklaras med den korta
upphettningstiden, vilket troligtvis ledde till att det fortfarande fanns en hel del högmolekylär
PDMS och oligomerer kvar i provet. En annan orsak till resultaten kunde vara att GC-proven
var upplösta i hexan, vilket gjorde att vattenlösliga produkter inte syntes i kromatogrammet.
Bildningen av cyklosiloxaner tyder på att PDMS:en bryts ner genom så kallade back-bitingreaktioner som också kan observeras vid termisk nedbrytning av ren PDMS. Reaktionen kan
ske på två sätt, endera genom att en syreatom i ändan av polymeren reagerar med en
kiselatom längre bak i polymeren, vilket frigör cyklisk siloxan. Det andra sättet är att
polymeren viker sig dubbelt och en syreatom där reagerar med en kiselatom, vilket i sin tur
frigör cyklisk siloxan. Storleken på cyklosiloxanen beror på hur långt bak i polymerkedjan
syreatomen attackerar.
De katalyserande komponenterna i oljorna hypotiserades vara antingen katjoner eller fettoch hartssyrorna. Effekten av kalciumjoner testades genom att tillföra 100 ppm
kalciumklorid upplöst i 5 µl destillerat vatten till ett prov av PDMS och bioolja 2. Samma
mängd rent destillerat vatten tillfördes ett annat prov av PDMS och bioolja 2. Därefter
hettades

båda

proven

i

nedbrytningshastigheten kunde konstateras, vilket tyder på att det är de fria fett- och/eller
hartssyrorna som katalyserar nedbrytningen av PDMS och driver back-biting-reaktionerna.
