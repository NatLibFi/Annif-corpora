Abstract:
The global economy has faced many changes since the 2010s, forcing Finland to pursue new
economic opportunities and relationships as trade is not growing as fast as expected and hoped.
As a result, the companies of the country are increasingly engaged in dealings with China, the
rising economic might. However, these deals are significantly complex due to two very different
cultures. For that reason, this thesis aims to elaborate how Finnish managers have adapted to
Chinese business contexts while working in China, and what kinds of steps Finnish managers
would need to take to succeed in their assignments in the country.
Finnish and Chinese national cultures were compared with each other and two kinds of crosscultural approaches were taken to examine the differences. The first one, dimensional approach,
gives a first and a general view on culture through different values that are used in making the
comparisons. The second one, distance approach, offers a deeper and an individual perspective
to culture and, together, these two approaches complement each other and try to offer a more
complete picture of culture. Differences between Finnish and Chinese cultures and the
respective business cultures and their underlying contexts were also examined, while cultural
adaptation and its obstacles were reviewed as well.
A qualitative study was conducted to investigate the adaptation process of Finnish managers
mostly in the provinces of Beijing and Jiangsu in China. Semi-structured interviewing was chosen
as the research method for this study due to its flexibility and the explorative nature of this study.
Six Finnish managers were interviewed in February–March 2020. Two Chinese managers who
live and work in Finland were also interviewed, and the collected data was used to support and
expand on what the Finns described.
The findings of this study brought several areas of interest to light, including hierarchy, public
harmony, building relationships, dealing with secrecy, and efficiency. Finnish owned companies
were stated to be easier to adapt to since the company culture is a hybrid of Finland and China.
Managers should adopt a proactive attitude and give clear instructions to their subordinates
while ensuring that they understand the instructions. Interpersonal relationships were also
identified as a key feature of adaptation. By building and nurturing strong relationships with a
large network of connections, trust can be gained, and various other benefits achieved. Further
research could focus on cultural differences between Chinese provinces and on Chinese
managers in Finland so that the understanding of the relationship between the two cultures
could be deepened.

1 Introduction

Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance — Confucius

East Asia, and its traditionally most influential region, China, can be regarded as very
exotic, distant, and even alien from the Western perspective, but this thesis aims to
demystify and to briefly unfold the Chinese business culture through the stories of
several Finnish nationals involved in working in the country.
The title of the thesis refers to the Mandarin Chinese names of both Finland and China.
The Mandarin name of Finland is 芬兰/芬蘭, Latinized as Fēnlán, which is used to
phonetically refer to Finland, but literally, the pair of syllables can be translated to
“fragrant orchid”. The Chinese also call their own country 中国/中國, Latinized as
Zhōngguó, literally meaning “Middle country”, for which there exists an old English
calque, Middle Kingdom.
The idea for the thesis came to be as the result of the author’s interest in East Asian
issues, having had his minor subject in East Asian studies and studied Mandarin Chinese
for approximately three years. While the area is economically tremendously important,
the culture also seems fascinating, paradoxical, and even ridiculous at times, kickstarting
the research into these peculiarities in the domains of business and work. Hopefully, by
studying them, more insights can be gained into the Chinese way of thinking and how
the Finnish ways should be adapted to them.
The tales of Finnish nationals, mostly managers, are inspected through the lens of
qualitative research, and with the help of thematic analysis. Originally, the aim of the
thesis was to study Chinese managers in Finnish business contexts to the same extent.
Due to a lack of time and suitable persons, the study solely concentrated on Finns in the
end.

1.1.

Background of the study

Finnish economy and its circumstances in the 2010s

Finland is a Northern European nation that bases its economy on foreign trade as it
cannot sustain its economic growth by solely concentrating on domestic trade due to its
small population. This strategy had worked wonders, as the Finnish exports had
quadrupled since the recession of early 1990s by 2008, which is when another global
economic crisis hit the Finnish economy yet again, the current account becoming deficit
and staying that way since 2008 until today with no end to be seen (Kangasjärvi, 2019).
Traditionally, Finland had looked no further than its immediate neighbors Russia and
Sweden that have served as the chief Finnish trading partners, but the trade with them
is not growing expectedly as of today due to many unforeseen events that have unfolded
in the 2010s. That is why a small economy such as Finland must quickly adapt to these
changes it has no control over.
Russia has been issued an increasing number of economic sanctions by the European
Union ever since 2014 as a backlash for the annexation of Crimea, which has been
catastrophic for the trade of Finland with Russia combined with the effect of the
counter-sanctions set by Russia towards EU in retaliation (Berg-Andersson & Kotilainen,
2016; European Union, 2017a). Haaparanta (2016) has estimated that Finland had lost
export profits worth over 1.8 billion US dollars just by June 2015, the total number of
Finnish exports to Russia decreasing by 44% from 2012 until 2015 (Berg-Andersson &
Kotilainen, 2016). Combined with the weak economic growth of Russia itself and rising
oil prices that have led into a weakening ruble and weakened purchase power, the whole
chain of events has caused Russia to lose its importance as a Finnish trading partner,
having been the second to third most important destination for Finnish exports at the
beginning of 2010s (Berg-Andersson & Kotilainen, 2016; Kangasniemi, 2019). However,
Russia is still one of the biggest importers for Finland aided by the rising prices of energy,
which has left the trade balance of the two countries wildly deficit from the Finnish
perspective (Finnish Customs, 2018b; Kangasniemi, 2019). These sanctions have even
2

Joonas Pylvinen

recently been prolonged until March 15, 2020, and they could be renewed in the future,
while the USA is stirring the pot and still coming up with new sanctions, forcing Finland
to search for opportunities elsewhere (Council of the European Union, 2019ab; Rapoza,
2019).
Instable and undesirable progressions have started to appear even inside the European
Economic Area, referring to the British decision to leave the European Union in 2017,
after the 2016 referendum (European Union, 2017b; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of
Finland, 2019b). The country properly and officially departed the EU on January 31, 2020
and is currently undergoing a transition period and negotiating a new partnership deal
with the union (European Commission, 2020). This event, commonly known as the Brexit,
has already shaken both economic and societal foundations not only in the United
Kingdom but also in Finland, as the UK is as of right now the sixth most important exports
destination for Finland, right after Russia (Statistics Finland, 2019). In case of a scenario
where a deal that includes economic solutions between the EU and the UK cannot be
agreed on, exporting to the UK could witness a similar negative response as in the case
of Russia, reducing the trade between Finland and the UK drastically. While the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Finland (2019b) reassures that the waning of the economic
presence of the UK on continental Europe may offer new possibilities for Finland in this
vacant space, these same possibilities are perfectly valid for all the other EU countries
as well, so they are not to be counted on.
Since the regions in proximity offer no promises of a secure way of increasing business
operations, Finland must look elsewhere to find the growth potential that the Finnish
economy is yearning for. That is where China, the ascending economy that already has
the largest GDP based on purchasing power parity as of now, comes into play
(International Monetary Fund, 2019; Martin, 2019).
However, as the velocity of growth of the recent years of the Chinese economy has
decelerated partly due to rising costs of labor and partly due to the US-China trade war
that could become a contemporary cold war situation, and the Chinese population has
started to age, it ought to be remembered that Japan was once thought the become the
nation with the largest GDP, which never happened, and this option should not be

3

Joonas Pylvinen

discarded when it comes to the future of China (Fickling, 2019; Winck, 2019; Wong,
2019).
Then again, the 2020 Corona outbreak that had its origin in China has already wreaked
havoc on the Chinese economy, and on the global economy overall as well, so these
speculations of economic growth are not rather relevant during this time, instead of
focusing on stabilizing and recovering from the situation worldwide (Weinland & Liu,
2020). According to the worst forecasts, the virus could cost the global economy already
$2.7 trillion, meaning that the annual global economic growth would stay at 0.00% this
year, i.e. no growth at all (Orlik, Rush, Cousin, & Hong, 2020). It all depends on whether
China can recover in a fast manner and use its strength to maintain the business
activities in the country (Orlik et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, China has already passed Russia as the fifth most important export
destination for Finland, thus becoming the second most important partner for Finland
outside the European Economic Area after the United States of America (Finnish
Customs, 2018ab; Finnish Statistics, 2019).

Overlook of Finnish Chinese trade

It has to be noted that the basis for the diplomatic relationship and trade between China
and Finland have their roots already in the 1950s, strengthened by different treaties and
especially by China opening up economically for the world (Kaitila & Kotilainen, 2017).
According to Bank of Finland Bulletin (2015), and as previously mentioned, while
traditional trading partners of Finland have lost some of their economic importance,
China has become all the more important as a business partner for Finland in the 2010s.
The country was already the single most important Asian trading partner of Finland in
terms of trade in 2018 with a current account of €8.2 billion (Finland Abroad– Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2019a). In addition to that, Finnish exports to China have
grown faster than imports from China since 2015, decreasing the trade deficit in favor
of Finland (Kaitila & Kotilainen, 2017).

4

Joonas Pylvinen

There were approximately 350 Finnish companies on the Chinese soil in 2019, located
mostly within the regions of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong (Finland Abroad– Ministry
for Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2019a).

Circumstances of the Chinese market

The Chinese manufacturing sector had already faced a slight decline before the Corona
outbreak, being hit especially hard in the vast Chinese automobile industry declining by
19% between January and August 2019, and overall, “growing at the slowest rate ever
forecast” according to Winck (2019), but according to Lardy (2019), the losses in the
Chinese manufacturing sector are being exaggerated (Bradsher, 2019; “Industrial profits
in the first three quarters fell”, 2019). However, during Q1 in 2020 these Chinese
automobile sales have plummeted down by 80%, and industrial production has halted
in general – decreasing by 13.5% in January-February 2020, when the growth had been
steady and generally over 5% monthly prior (Jones, Brown, & Palumbo, 2020; Orlik et
al., 2020). Even when the workers have been able to return to work, a lack of worldwide
orders and inventory still hinders production (Orlik et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, an aging population that has been estimated to start declining in the
2030s, the trade war with the US, and the possibility of entering the so-called “middleincome trap” remain real challenges, and even dangers to China even after the Corona
outbreak will be over. Furthermore, it has been predicted that the largest corporations
could move their factories abroad in search of cheaper workforce (Carter, 2018; Lee,
2019).
All in all, the role of China and its economy in the world will inevitably start to shift away
from manufacturing in an ever-growing fashion, since the country already has a
developed infrastructure and plenty of manufacturing facilities combined with a
shrinking labor force (Bradsher & Tang, 2019; Orr, 2018). The signs have been there: For
example, Samsung has moved tens of thousands of jobs away from China to Vietnam in
the 2010s (Orr, 2018). Mental preparation should be begun already at this point and the
role of service sectors will grow in importance, presenting opportunities for foreign
5

Joonas Pylvinen

companies and their expertise in this field (Bradsher, 2019; Bradsher & Tang, 2019;
Carter, 2018; Lee, 2019).
The sheer size of the Chinese domestic market will ensure that not all of the Chinese
production will be ever shifted away, even with the decreasing population (Orr, 2018).
Surely, this will be more easily said than done as the uncertainty caused by the shadow
of the trade war is distancing long-term investments away from China towards more
secure destinations (Orr, 2018).
Even if the Chinese industry is being shut down, albeit very slowly, 78.7% of new
companies in 2014 were operating in the service sector, and a similar trend has
continued ever since (OECD, 2016). According to the report by OECD (2016), the Chinese
government has started supporting and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship
especially in the ICT sector, and fruits of this include mobile apps Alibaba and WeChat,
both of which nearly every Chinese person with a smartphone uses. The main
motivation for innovating, in the long run, is to be able to internationalize with their
already competitive products and services (Gilardoni, 2017). They are on their way there
with companies such as Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent becoming major players in their
respective industries. However, the service sector is still offering the most opportunities
for foreign companies as well, growing fast for the time being Gilardoni, 2017; OECD,
2016).

Opportunities and challenges for Finnish companies in China

Now that it has been established that China presents enormous opportunities for
various Finnish enterprises, it would be good to acknowledge that entering the Chinese
market is not as simple as dealing with the immediate neighboring countries. The
national cultures of Finland and China are very different from each other, which also
reflects on the way business is conducted in them and the psychic distance between
them can also cause moments of hesitation within individuals working in companies that
participate in international trade, since conducting business operations in China is no
easy feat (Gilardoni, 2017; Håkanson, 2014; Liberman & Trope, 2014). The cultures and
6

Joonas Pylvinen

the circumstances of the countries especially influence individual members that pertain
to these cultures. Yet, it must be acknowledged that national cultures and sub-cultures
offer just basic insights to human behavior: Individuals act and behave differently.
However, by better understanding the national culture of the other party and having a
favorable attitude toward it, it is easier to trust the representatives of the culture as well
(Ivanova-Gongne, 2015). Thus, trade dealings will certainly be easier than if the option
of understanding the other party is discarded or their culture is discredited altogether.
Even though China is physically closer and more accessible and connected to the rest of
the world than ever, the psychic distance between China and the West remains great
(Gilardoni, 2017). Since the risk for failure for foreign companies entering the Chinese
market with few preparations is great, there is no room for cultural rigidity and
arrogancy (Gilardoni, 2017). That is why Finnish companies ought to prepare well before
entering such undertakings to evade any unnecessary regrettable fates.
Curiously, Finnish companies rarely consider cultural differences as one of the greatest
factors preventing mutual trade, despite the fact that these differences are usually the
most significant barriers in international business and when operating foreign
subsidiaries (Kaitila & Kotilainen, 2017; Oh, Lee, & Se, 2018). According to a survey by
Team Finland, Finnish companies think that various technical difficulties, registration
requirements, legislation, and customs processes are the biggest obstacles to
developing trade in China instead (as cited by Kaitila and Kotilainen, 2017). It has also
been claimed that foreign companies face stricter entry requirements to the Chinese
market and must give over their patents, which raises concern for intellectual property
theft (Finland Abroad– Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2019a). It remains a key
challenge for Finnish companies to enter the market while protecting their own IPs.

Objective of the thesis

The purpose of this thesis is to examine the cultural differences and risks related to these
differences between the two nations of China and Finland, and how cultural adaptation
could be used as a tool to close the gap between the two national cultures so that the
Finns representing Finnish companies in China could engage in business activities more
effectively in China and accomplish more successes by adapting accordingly to the
differences. To achieve this, successful adaptation practices already adopted by Finnish
nationals to diminish the cultural gap will be identified, and their benefits and
disadvantages will be further scrutinized. The effect of becoming familiar with local
cultures under the wide umbrella term of national culture and how that knowledge
could help managers with their cultural adaptation process will also be examined. The
findings will add to the mass of existing previous literature by considering both the
perspective of representatives of both Finnish and Chinese national cultures, and they
will hopefully aid future Finnish nationals to better prepare for their endeavors in China.
As mentioned, Finnish managers’ adaptational practices will also be considered in the
context of multiple Chinese cultural regions, since differences exist between the cultures
of the local provinces, and even within them, in terms of languages or dialects, habits,
values, and norms (Gao & Long, 2014; Gong, Chow, & Ahlstrom, 2011). According to an
itinerary from the 1800s, “there was much friction among the various Chinese dialect
groups . . . almost as if they came from different countries and cultures,” and while the
national language, Mandarin, has gained a strong foothold since, the differences remain
to some extent (Gong et al., 2011, p. 224). Therefore, to investigate how the local
cultures might influence the process of cultural adaptation is something that will create
valuable additional information.
To conclude, the relevance of the topic becomes especially emphasized in today’s
globalized world of cultural bubbles and indifferences (Henriques, 2014).

The following are the main research question of this thesis:
•

What can expatriate managers do to adapt to new cultural contexts when going
on international assignments? What types of benefits and disadvantages can
such adaptation cause?

•

How do Finnish expatriate managers and their Chinese counterparts possibly
misunderstand each other due to cultural differences? How do they overcome
these situations?

•

How can Finnish expatriate managers better adapt culturally to a Chinese
cultural context and does this context potentially influence their ways of
thinking?

•

How can business managers overcome cultural differences in business contexts
aided by the process of cultural adaptation?

1.3.

Key concepts

The People’s Republic of China or mainland China will simply be referred to as China in
this text as a separation from the Republic of China, informally known as Taiwan. Also,
the citizens of mainland China are referred to as Chinese, which neither includes ethnic
Chinese from Taiwan nor from other Southeast Asian countries or other overseas
communities that have ethnic Chinese members. The separation is made because ethnic
Chinese from different countries and even from different parts of the mainland
accordingly manifest different cultural values, and these regions are, to a large effect,
defined by their regional dialects (Gao & Long, 2014; Gong et al., 2011; Ramström, 2005).
When conducting the interviews for this thesis, it was revealed that the Finns in question
had been involved in rather a small pool of provinces in China, more precisely in Beijing
Municipality, Jiangsu, Shanghai Municipality, and Guangdong. This was a logical result,
since, as mentioned above, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai have been identified as
the provinces where most Finnish companies operating in China are located (Finland
Abroad– Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, 2019a). It must be noted that Hong Kong
has a separate society, culture, and mindset than mainland China, even having results
9

Joonas Pylvinen

of its own in the Hofstede and the GLOBE Project models (Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov,
2010). The question remains if Hong Kong is a subculture of the greater Chinese region,
or a cultural area of its own even though it has separate results in these studies.
Regardless of the answer, follow-up research should be conducted in other Chinese
provinces as well to better compare the differences.
Cultural adaptation refers to the concept that was defined by Francis (1991) as “an
attempt to elicit approval from members of a foreign culture by attempting to become
behaviorally more similar to members of that culture” (as cited by Jia & Rutherford,
2010). The ones who are attempting to receive this approval, and who are under the
focus of this thesis, are expatriates, i.e. managers conducting business activities outside
of their country of origin. These are simply individuals who represent their respective
companies and they are the ones who take concrete actions that intend to maintain and
improve the relationships between the companies through personal interactions
(Ivanova-Gongne, 2015). However, the adaptation process of these individuals is of
more interest for this thesis than their processes of expatriation. This study simply
happens to focus on expatriates out of convenience in its empirical part, but the results
can be said to be applicable to any kinds of persons conducting business activities, not
just expatriate managers. The expatriates’ efforts of adaptation in Chinese contexts will
be revised by interviewing them. Due to the focus, this thesis applies an individual
perspective to culture, cultural adaptation, and intercultural business relations, which is
examined with the help of cultural distance.

2 Cross-cultural activities and approaches

Culture and national culture

Culture is a broad concept which is said to encompass, for example, the shared meanings,
behavioral patterns, beliefs, morals, values, and customs of a group of people, where
these groups can be anything from nations to organizations, such as companies (Chen,
10

Joonas Pylvinen

Chao, Xie, & Tjosvold, 2018; Leung, Bhagat, Buchan, Erez, & Gibson, 2005). However, it
is but an oversimplification: The concept is so complex that while reduced to these
dimensions, its contexts and levels are invisible, and the dimensions offer an incomplete
representation of a culture, but the best one available (Fang, 2012; Leung et al., 2005;
Tung & Stahl, 2018). It must also be acknowledged that there is a difference between
the broad concept of culture and national culture that is only a part of it (Gould & Grein,
2009; Shi & Wang, 2011). Culture is always an underlying context in human interaction,
while national culture may not be, and, while not central to this research, it is
worthwhile to remember it as a guideline (Gould & Grein, 2009). That is why the results
of this thesis will be compared with those provided by national culture theories, GLOBE
and Hofstede models, to be more precise. There might be interesting contrasts and
paradoxes regarding the models and the firsthand data provided by this thesis. If found,
they could suggest that some general traits in national cultures, stated by the models,
might be absent in some contexts, for example. However, it has been suggested that
paradoxes are always present in culture, and Chinese Yin Yang philosophy offers an
example of this (Fang, 2012). It suggests that individuals are both collectivistic and
individualistic, “depending on situations, context, and time.” (Fang, 2012, p. 34). This is
something that cultural models often disregard, and especially due to that, the existence
and naturality of these paradoxes should be kept in mind.
When individuals of one of these national cultural groups leave their group and enter
another, they are bound to face a culture shock, which is why the concept of culture
needs to be attempted to be deconstructed, so that the factors for the differences
behind the shock could be better analyzed and understood (Jun, Gentry, & Hyun, 2001).
Cultural differences have always existed, but the importance of understanding different
national cultures in business contexts was first brought to the spotlight in the 1970s, and
it has been constantly investigated further ever since. The research remains important
as no universal culture exists, despite the globalization of the world, and recent
technological inventions are claimed to have even strengthened the cultural differences
(Leung et al., 2005). Social media may be included in such a list of inventions, but Zaw
(2018) has pointed out that social media can be helpful as a tool of cultural adaptation.
In the case of international students coming to China, social media helped them not only
11

Joonas Pylvinen

to communicate with their home countries and local Chinese communities, but
conversations and interactions with local people using the social media offered the
students a great deal of cultural information at the same time (Zaw, 2018).
To examine the differences between the national cultures of China and Finland, the
classic model of cultural dimensions by Geert Hofstede will be used, combined with the
newer GLOBE Project model. They offer a basis for the concept of national culture in this
thesis because of their convenience, broad use, and familiarity, despite the criticisms
the models have received over time. However, they are not to be taken at their face
value: The information offered by these models must be compared with the actual
results and the models should only act as basic guidelines. It is also important to
introduce the distance approaches in addition to the model of the GLOBE Project.
Together, they can relieve the disadvantages that exist within the Hofstede model,
forming a little clearer picture of national cultures.
When the criticisms that the dimensional approach models have received are inspected
more closely, there are inconsistencies between the two models (Venaik & Brewer, 2008,
2010). Especially the dimension called “uncertainty avoidance” is problematic, since the
two models might even depict different concepts, despite sharing the same name
(Venaik & Brewer, 2008, 2010). The dimension of “collectivism” in the Hofstede model
is also inconsistent with the GLOBE model (Venaik & Brewer, 2011). According to Venaik
and Brewer (2011), it should be changed into “self-orientation/work-orientation,” while
the corresponding GLOBE dimension remains relevant. The shared dimensions between
the models may also be based on stereotypes instead of actual features within societies
of different cultures, in addition (Shi & Wang, 2011). What the dimensions reflect could
neither be reliable nor valid on an individual level, and questionable even on an
organizational level, as they are further claimed to be prone to stereotyping and
exaggerating differences within national cultures (Venaik & Brewer, 2013). As a result,
the models should only be considered general guidelines. Despite all this, studies have
shown that when scores of the two models were compared, GLOBE succeeded in
describing and understanding national cultures better, in general (Shi & Wang, 2011).
The truth can only be found by personally interacting with individuals and groups of said
national cultures, and during this time, the firsthand experiences can be compared to
12

Joonas Pylvinen

the models, but it has to be noted that they present unreliable measurements of
national cultures.
Lastly, not all the dimensions of the dimensional approach are relevant when it comes
to expatriate assignments: Organizational culture usually overrides some aspects of
national cultures (Shenkar, 2012a). For example, even though the host country had high
or low scores of power distance, the value that the organization from the home country
has is the only relevant one (Shenkar, 2012a).

2.1.

Dimensional approach, its critique, and limitations

The two models that measure the so-called cultural distances between national cultures
that were introduced above have a couple of foundational differences. According to the
Hofstede model, values pertain to societies and practices to organizations, while the
GLOBE model offers a view that both can coexist at both the societal and organizational
levels (Shi & Wang, 2011).

2.1.1. Hofstede’s cultural dimensions

Hofstede’s model of cultural dimensions is a classic tool of intercultural research that is
used to approach the concept of national culture within international marketing both
due to its pioneer status as well as its convenience (Shi & Wang, 2011). Having been
developed for organizational culture research, the model tries to compartmentalize
culture into the value categories of masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism,
power distance, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence/restraint
(Hofstede et al., 2010). Different national cultures are then divided into these categories
and given numerical values to represent how they differ from one another (Hofstede et
al., 2010; Leung et al., 2005).

The model has both its critics and defendants: On the one hand, it has been claimed that
national cultures are stable and change very slowly over time (Leung et al., 2005; Shi &
Wang, 2011). On the other hand, the model has been claimed to be too limited and not
to represent actual culture very accurately, since it was collected a long time ago and in
the context of a single company and its subsidiaries (Leung et al., 2005; Shi & Wang,
2011). However, perhaps the greatest restriction of the model is that it ignores the
individual level of culture altogether (Tung & Stahl, 2018). By using a combination of
different models and approaches and models in this thesis, potential threats to
credibility caused by the restricted nature of this model can be avoided. Thus, it is a
worthy tool that offers a view to be complemented by other theories.

2.1.2. GLOBE Project

GLOBE, standing for Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness, is a
research project that was founded to build upon Hofstede’s cultural dimensions model
(GLOBE Project, n.d.; Shi & Wang, 2011). The project has thoroughly examined
leadership, and, more importantly, societal culture (GLOBE Project, n.d.). It arranges
national cultures according to cultural dimensions as the Hofstede model does, while
the researched countries are further arranged in various culture groups, based on similar
results. (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Shi & Wang, 2011).
The GLOBE dimensions are performance orientation, assertiveness, future orientation,
humane

orientation, institutional

collectivism,

in-group

collectivism,

gender

egalitarianism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Shi &
Wang, 2011). Out of the new dimensions, assertiveness measures the extent to which
people are aggressive and confrontational in their social interactions, humane
orientation depicts how societies or organizations encourage individuals to act in an
altruistic manner, and performance orientation how innovations, high standards, and
hard work are appreciated (GLOBE Project, n.d.). Gender egalitarianism roughly
corresponds to masculinity/femininity, with the distinction that masculinity/femininity
is also associated with the societal competitiveness and the status of gender roles,
14

Joonas Pylvinen

whereas gender egalitarianism concentrates more on the inequality between men and
women in society (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Hofstede et al., 2011). Future orientation
incorporates partly both long-term orientation and indulgence by Hofstede, whereas
individuality/collectivism has been divided in two parts, known as institution
collectivism and in-group collectivism within the GLOBE Project model (GLOBE Project,
n.d.; Hofstede et al., 2011).
The data provided by the GLOBE model depicts both the cultural values of reality as well
as the ideal values present in the culture (GLOBE Project, n.d.). Curiously enough, the
practical values often fail to match the reality, which is perfectly plausible, but no one
has been able to explain the phenomenon as yet (Brewer & Venaik, 2010).
The GLOBE model has been lauded for its expansiveness on the Hofstede model, but it
has also been criticized for being difficult to interpret due to the definitions of its
dimensions being vague (Virkus, 2009). Despite these flaws, GLOBE was depicted as
state-of-the-art by Javidan, Stahl, and Brodbeck (2005), and it has withstood the test of
time, as they predicted. Also, an extension of the research called GLOBE 2020 is currently
being conducted, polishing it even further (GLOBE Project, n.d.).

2.2.

Distance approach

In contrast to the dimensional approach to culture, the distance approach avoids
simplifying culture and tries to unravel its layers instead. This approach is used to explain
how cultures differ from each other on a deeper and more individual level. At the same
time, it is made clear that generalizations cannot be made when comparing cultures,
and that cultures are experienced differently by different people.

2.2.1. Cultural distance

The concept of cultural distance is used to convey the diversity and its effects on human
interaction that is present in different national cultures around the world, although, as
discussed, culture is such an abstract and complex concept that the task is tremendously
demanding, if not impossible (Shenkar, 2012b; Triandis, 1998). It can manifest itself in
various ways, such as differences in languages, family structures, religions, lifestyle, and,
lastly, in values present in the cultures (Triandis, 1998). The point about the distance in
values in different cultures makes the concept of cultural distance relevant to the
models presented in the dimensional approach section. However, such representations
that the models offer are often nothing but simplistic mirages that try to offer something
tangible out of something that is not (Shenkar, 2012b).
Shenkar (2012b) points out that the concept of cultural distance has many flaws in form
of assumptions that are made within it, such as 1) that national cultures would not
change over time, 2) representatives, such as expatriates, from national culture A going
to national culture B having symmetrical experiences as if the vice versa happened, and
3) that national cultures would be the same throughout, with no regional variations. It
is untrue, which is the core issue of why the model is problematic (Shenkar, 2012b).
However, since it offers tools for numerical and easily digestible data representing the
differences, it has been readily accepted and widely applied within the research of
international business (Shenkar, 2012b). The following extension concept of cultural
interaction, also called friction, is given by Shenkar (2012b). The concept of friction is
used to explain the importance of individuals and interaction: Cultural differences have
no meaning in a theoretical void, but they only become meaningful when the differences
are made to interact (Shenkar, 2012a, 2012b). For example, national cultures could be
called differently shaped pieces of a puzzle: Some pieces fit with each other well, being
synergetic together, some fail completely to fit. However, most cultures are somewhere
in the between, which is where the term friction comes from.
Shenkar (2012a) also claims that talking about cultural distance instead of friction is nonproductive if the environments whose distance is being measured are dissimilar, since
16

Joonas Pylvinen

that would be comparing “apples and oranges” together. In practice, managers from a
certain national culture work well with counterparts from other national cultures that
are synergetic with each other (Shenkar, 2012a). In this case, friction is at a suitable level.
It is to be noted that both high and low levels of friction are undesirable, and a balance
should be sought (Shenkar, 2012a).
It has been suggested that especially differences in culture and language create friction,
but employees known as “boundary spanners” or “bridge individuals” have the ability
to partly relieve that by serving as intermediaries between the cultures in question
(Barner-Rasmussen, Ehrnrooth, Koveshnikov, & Mäkelä, 2014; Jia, Rutherford, &
Lamming, 2016; Sekiguchi, 2016). The definitions differ slightly from each other, but in
both of them, individuals within multicultural organizations identify with one of the
cultures and have extensive knowledge of the other associated culture and/or its
languages, and, based on them, these individuals have several abilities that regular
employees do not have (Barner-Rasmussen et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016; Sekiguchi, 2016).
These abilities include, for example, gathering information that would be otherwise
missed, harnessing and connecting their networks within the company, interpreting and
delivering messages between the cultures, and preventing instances of harmful
communication due to cultural differences while bridging between cliques formed by
people from one of the cultures (Barner-Rasmussen et al., 2014; Sekiguchi, 2016).
Having such individuals in a multicultural company would certainly be an advantage in
many aspects, both from the perspectives of the global headquarters and the local
subsidiary, and they can even facilitate the adaptation process of expatriates by the
virtue of their abilities (Barner-Rasmussen et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2018;
Sekiguchi, 2016)
All in all, cultural distance can work as a measurement concept, but only when its three
aforementioned flaws are acknowledged, and the data provided by the models
measuring cultural distance are supported by additional theories and concepts so that
possible skew would be minimized (Shenkar, 2012b). However, Shenkar (2012a)
suggests that cultural distance should slowly be discontinued in favor of friction, which
describes the interaction of national cultures better in detail. Friction has been
somewhat ignored in business literature due to its flaw of being difficult to measure
17

Joonas Pylvinen

numerically, contrary to the dimensional models and their codified values (Shenkar,
2012a).

2.2.2. Psychic distance

Psychic distance is a concept that facilitates depicting how individuals experience
differences between two or more given national or other cultures. The concept, also
known as psychological distance, tries to explain how one separates various other
elements from themselves with the help of various dimensions, such as temporal, spatial,
social, and hypothetical distance (Baltatescu, 2014). These elements, or aspects, such as
languages or customs, are associated with other elements using the dimensions
(Liberman & Trope, 2014). Their differences are afterward investigated based on how
they are experienced individually, as opposed to cultural distance, where the differences
are measured with given variables on an organizational level (Liberman & Trope, 2014).
Because of lower psychic distance, companies, and especially individual employees
within them tend to favor expatriate stints in closer countries with similar cultures
before moving on to farther places (O’Grady & Lane, 1996). The closer the physical
distance and the experienced cultural gap between the countries are, the more
efficiently the business relations are improved, aided by heightened mutual feelings of
trust, for instance (Håkanson, 2014). However, having international activities and
sending expatriates on assignments just based on perceived similarities is an inviable
strategy (O’Grady & Lane, 1996). By doing so, both companies and expatriates can
become blind to cultural differences, even though the countries and their respective
national cultures would be mostly similar (O’Grady & Lane, 1996). It is easier to manage
the differences the more visible and notable they are, which eliminates the benefits of
low psychic distance, which is also known as a psychic distance paradox (O’Grady & Lane,
1996). Thus, cultural differences should be identified, adaptational measures should be
already adopted from the beginning, and companies should strive to learn from their its
cultural environment to minimize errors caused by misjudging the level of psychic
distance (O’Grady & Lane, 1996).
18

Joonas Pylvinen

In the case of this study, the spatial distance between Finland and China is great, as are
the perceived differences within the respective cultures. Psychic distance can cause
Finnish and Chinese individuals to unconsciously abstract their thinking processes when
it comes to the culture of the other. In other words, they may think in less concrete and
practical terms, making complex comprehension more difficult (Baltatescu, 2014;
Fiedler, Jung, Wänke, & Alexopoulos, 2012; Hamilton, 2015). Moreover, since individuals
use different parts of their brains to process differences and similarities usually from an
egocentric perspective, it becomes more probable that the differences are highlighted
if they are too noticeable (Håkanson, 2014; Liberman & Trope, 2010, 2014). In this case,
that makes it more difficult for Finnish managers to relate to the Chinese and to trust
them, and vice versa (Håkanson, 2014; Liberman & Trope, 2010, 2014). This would
consequently mean that it would be more difficult for Finnish expatriate managers to
conduct business activities with their Chinese counterparts if the levels of trust are
inadequate.
It should be noted that the experienced distance is asymmetrical for different parties,
though – an individual, such as an expatriate, from one country, can experience the
distance in another way than another from the other country, influenced by countryspecific cultural circumstances, as speculated by Håkanson (2014) and proven by
Håkanson, Ambos, Schuster, and Leicht-Deobald (2016). No studies have been
conducted to observe the asymmetricity between Finnish and Chinese national cultures,
but it can be presumed that representatives from both cultures have unique
perspectives and ways of interacting with members of the other national culture. It can
also be argued that it is potentially easier for one party to adapt to the ways of the other
because of the asymmetricity. Then again, Yildiz and Fey (2016) have shown that Swedes
have lower perceptions towards Chinese culture in terms of psychic distance, and that
they also have a more negative attitude towards the Chinese culture. Meanwhile, the
opposite rings true: Chinese people have higher perceptions towards Swedish culture
and view it positively (Yildiz & Fey, 2016). These differences have been explained by
differences in perceived statuses held by these two countries (Yildiz & Fey, 2016).
However, decreasing spatial distance via relocation, in other words, by moving to a
physically closer environment, helps expatriate Finns tremendously in this case to relate
19

Joonas Pylvinen

more to the Chinese people and their culture, allowing the Finns to think more
concretely about them (Hamilton, 2015). Should they try to put themselves to the shoes
of the Chinese and thus decreasing social distance, the gap can be reduced even further,
facilitating communication and understanding (Hamilton, 2015).
The concept of psychic distance is influenced by how people from different national
cultures perceive, operate, and relate to different values, such as collectivism and
individualism, or short-term orientation and long-term orientation (Wong & Wyer,
2016). It will cause different individuals to have different perspectives and it affects their
ability to attempt to change those perspectives (Wong & Wyer, 2016). Being
individualistic and short-term oriented decreases perspective flexibility (Wong & Wyer,
2016), which contributes to the difficulty of relating, since people that have a
background in Finnish national culture can allegedly be described as having both of
those qualities (Hofstede et al., 2010). Finns should acknowledge these traits while
abroad and adapt accordingly. However, language, habits, legislation, et cetera play a
role as well, as mentioned when defining cultural distance above (Håkanson et al., 2016).
Therefore, knowledge about cultural differences and values might not be enough, since
other differences, especially in differing laws, should be acknowledged as well. These
elements can also be viewed as distant by individuals as well – for example, Chinese
Mandarin and Finnish language do not share much in common, which is an alienating
factor in this case.
Furthermore, by examining cultural differences and psychic distance in the case of
Finnish expatriates operating in China, potential faux pas need to be identified and
evaded. All of this is necessary, as the risk of failing is very much real: According to a
report by Weber and Shandwick, 48% of all foreign companies that entered the Chinese
market had failed and discontinued their business activities within two years of setting
up local operations there (as cited by Gilardoni, 2017). According to Gilardoni (2017),
many of these companies reportedly adopted an attitude that whatever they were doing
in their countries of origin was already working, and they considered changes to a
winning formula unnecessary. However, as found out by Bartel-Radic and Giannelloni
(2017), excessive confidence in one’s communicational skills may lead to a neglection of
cultural differences and, consequently, into an insufficient understanding of foreign
20

Joonas Pylvinen

cultures, which is undesired when conducting cross-cultural business operations. As
obvious as it might seem, companies need open-minded individuals that are motivated
in understanding different cultures instead as a prerequisite to run their foreign business
operations effectively (Bartel-Radic & Giannelloni, 2017). Afterward, to tap into the
competitive advantage that the local companies already have there, context-specific
cultural knowledge must be acquired first (Albescu, Pugna, & Paraschiv, 2009; Holden,
2001). This can be done both externally in the business environment via learning by
doing, and internally from the local employees via dialog, since it is the key feature of
setting up successful cross-cultural business operations and context fitting marketing
strategies (Albescu et al., 2009; Holden, 2001).

2.3.

Cultural adaptation and its obstacles

According to Jun et al. (2001), cultural adaptation is an active cognitive process that can
reduce the stress levels and uncertainty between representatives of different cultures,
thus bettering their mental well-being, while giving them social competences when
communicating in the context of the other culture. Weck and Ivanova (2013) even claim
that cultural adaptation is a basic requirement for mutual trust, which is consequently
needed to build long-term business relationships in intercultural contexts. It can be
claimed that when two parties that belong to different cultures are trying to
communicate, or on an even deeper level, trying to do business with each other, they
both benefit from making an effort to understand where the other party is coming from
to communicate more effectively.
Chen & al. (2018) state that simply understanding the norms and values of the other
culture can lead to adaptation and synergy in intercultural transactions, but they also
add that interacting within the same culture might still lead to better results. In other
words, members of the same cultural group mingling with each other can be more
efficient even when communicating poorly than parties of different cultures whose
intercultural interaction is somewhat successful. Since adaptation and especially
successful adaptation should not be taken for granted, it should be one of the main

21

Joonas Pylvinen

priorities of companies and their outgoing employees, such as expatriate managers. The
companies should at least offer intensive courses for their outgoing candidates to
kickstart the upcoming adaptation process, even though their effect on the candidates’
deep long-term perceptions would be insufficient (Baack, Dow, Parente, & Bacon, 2015).
Adaptation begins from a very basic level where outgoing employees first learn about
the specific national culture on a theoretical level and about cultural stereotypes that
are related to that culture at the same time (Weck & Ivanova, 2013). Once a business
relationship has been built, and the parties consider each other acquaintances, a more
complex learning process through open communication can be initiated, and in a bestcase scenario, the learning continues with the help of personal relationships, if the
expatriates manage to befriend their foreign counterparts (Weck & Ivanova, 2013).
Adaptation has, however, challenges and limitations. It has been claimed that the
influence of psychic distance has failed to decrease to a greater degree, despite the
development of various communication technologies in the recent past (Håkanson,
2014). On the contrary, its effect could even have increased, which means that
adaptation would be more difficult (Håkanson, 2014). Also, the expatriates’ crosscultural motivation is a major factor, since their interest in the local culture or the lack
of it and their ability to lead and manage employees in another culture will have a direct
impact both on their ability to adapt and on the local employees’ relationships with the
manager (Oh et al., 2018). When failed, deficient adaptation can lead to more stress,
feelings of loneliness and isolation, and even confusion about one’s own identity (Jun et
al., 2001). However, it is good to be reminded that by being motivated to adapt and by
developing efficient coping strategies, culture-related stress and the negative effects
can be avoided (Jun et al., 2001). Consumer behavior and one’s family also support the
outgoing employee in the adaptation process: By gaining cultural knowledge first,
participation in the host culture becomes easier, which reduces the feelings of alienation,
finally leading to personal satisfaction (Jun et al., 2001).
According to Baack et al. (2015), there is a certain confirmation bias that makes
managers approach the cultural differences based on their existing beliefs and thoughts.
There is nothing wrong in this per se, but when they are faced with information that

22

Joonas Pylvinen

conflicts with their beliefs, they find it hard to trust and process that information, making
it hard for them to adjust their ways of thinking to the way things are (Baack et al., 2015).
As claimed by Jia and Rutherford (2010), ignoring cultural differences between cooperating companies from other countries indirectly impacts their business
performances. If the differences are disregarded, mutual trust and intercultural
communication between the companies will suffer, which demonstrated why the
differences should be heeded. It has even been claimed that a large cultural distance
between the companies may affect the long-term relationship of the two if left
untended (Jia & Lamming, 2014; Jia & Rutherford, 2010). Presumably, disregarding
cultural differences will negatively affect trust-building even on an individual level, as
well.
Paradoxically, cultural similarities can also cause a headache for partners in these dyadic
relationships, even though the purpose of cultural adaptation is to increase the
familiarity between the cultures (Lin & Malhotra, 2012). For example, sometimes
managers are disinterested in adapting culturally unless it takes a minimum effort, but
other times, a chance to learn overtakes the unwillingness to adapt to large differences
(Lin & Malhotra, 2012).
Nevertheless, by adapting culturally and tending to the relationships, most of the
cultural problems can fortunately be avoided and positive relationships will usually lead
to not only cost reduction benefits, but also to other increased competencies while
operating in the host culture (Jia & Rutherford, 2010; Jia & Lamming, 2013; Lin &
Malhotra, 2012). Furthermore, cultural adaptation also becomes more effective and
more necessary in managing conflicts when the organization has heterogeneous cultural
values, for instance, individualism versus collectivism (Chen et al.,2018). For Chinese
subsidiaries of Western companies, this could be the very reality that craves attendance,
once again proving the usefulness of cultural adaptation.
There are still problems even when adapting, as the degrees of adaptation might differ
wildly, and the processes of adaptation sometimes fail to be mutual, i.e. both parties try
to meet each other halfway in their co-operation (Lin & Malhotra, 2012). Usually, the
party that is globally viewed more powerful has the upper hand in the interactions and
23

Joonas Pylvinen

it will force the companion to adapt to their culture and values, even when acting in the
territories of the less powerful partner (Lin & Malhotra, 2012). By increasing the level of
adaptation on both sides, mutual benefits are also greater (Jia & Lamming, 2013). Due
to this, it is more than recommendable to deeply engage in cultural adaptation, no
matter the circumstances.
In addition to previous troubles, it is becoming more and more commonplace that
people are trying to adjust to the cultural assumptions of the other party instead of their
own, which is causing clashes between the cultures (Chen et al., 2018). Due to this, it is
all the more important to have a culturally diverse organization, so that it would be
easier to consider the situation of the other party, and thus, better succeed with
adapting and having fewer conflicts (Chen et al., 2018).

3 Chinese and Finnish national cultures

Since it would be impossible to conduct a cultural research without becoming familiar
with and delving deeply in the cultures in question, this section aims to explain the main
characteristics of both Chinese and Finnish cultures and more specifically, their business
cultures as well.
The two cultures are first compared with each other using models of cultural dimensions
provided by Hofstede and GLOBE Project, while the main theoretical differences
between China and Finland are scrutinized. Chinese and Finnish cultures are examined
more thoroughly afterward, and cultural adaptation to Chinese business contexts is
observed with the help of previous literature.

Cultural comparison of China and Finland using the
dimensional approach

When comparing the results given by the Hofstede and the GLOBE models (see Tables 1
and 2 below), both similarities and differences can be perceived. However, one must
remember once again that the practice values of the GLOBE model do not always match
the reality (Brewer & Venaik, 2010).

With respective scores of 80 and 5.04, both models indicate that power distance is high
in China, and consequently, inherent inequality and hierarchies are strong. Interestingly,
the Chinese seem to value power distance less than what its effect currently is in their
culture with a score of 3.10, being still higher than the GLOBE average value score of
2.75. According to the Hofstede model, Finland is quite the opposite of China when it
comes to power distance with a low score of 33, but the practice score of the GLOBE
model suggests similarities since the score there is 4.89. However, the Finnish value
score is a meager 2.19, which also suggests differences in the approaches to this
dimension of culture.
The Hofstede model states that China is very collectivistic with a score of 20, suggesting
that people make their decisions in the interests of their in-groups, as opposed to
themselves. Curiously, according to Hofstede et al. (2010), this would also mean that
people commit somewhat weakly to their employer organizations. The GLOBE model
supports the statement about high levels of collectivism, as China has institutional
collectivism and in-group collectivism scores of 4.77 and 5.8, those scores being higher
than on the respective GLOBE averages of 4.25 and 5.13. However, the Chinese value
less collectivism on both levels, especially when it comes to in-group collectivism.
Meanwhile, Finland scores high on this category with a score of 63, indicating of an
individualistic culture. The GLOBE model institutional and in-group collectivistic practice
scores are 4.63 and 4.07, which suggests that on an organizational level, Finns
appreciate sharing the resources and working together almost as eagerly as the Chinese,
but the lower in-group score suggests that loyalty and a certain “pack mentality” are
lower than in China.
With a masculinity score of 66, the Hofstede model claims that China would be a
competitive society, where traditional gender roles are enforced. People lowly esteem
leisure time and they will work very late if needed, while students compete for places in
the best universities with their exam scores (Hofstede et al., 2010). This is what the
GLOBE model states as well, as the practice score of gender egalitarianism is 3.05, i.e.
relatively low, and it is also lower on the GLOBE average that is 3.37. It is valued more,
but only slightly with a score of 3.68, being on the lower end of the spectrum of the
GLOBE average that has a score of 4.51. Finland scores once again in a different way on
26

Joonas Pylvinen

the Hofstede mode with a masculinity score of 26. This suggests that the environment
of Finnish culture is very uncompetitive, status is invisible, and equality and the quality
of life are appreciated (Hofstede et al., 2010).
The Hofstede model states that China has a low score of 30 in the dimension of
uncertainty avoidance, where the first real difference with the GLOBE model occurs, as
the practice score for the dimension on the latter is 4.94, i.e. relatively high. Hofstede et
al. (2010) try to explain why the Chinese embrace the uncertainty by stating that people
simply are adaptive: In China, truth is relative and can change, rules and laws can be
bent to fit the needs of the moment, and the language itself is full of vague meanings
left for the listener to interpret. The GLOBE model, however, states that the value score
of China in this category is 5.28, which would be higher than what the GLOBE average of
4.62 is. Finland has a score of 59 on the dimension of uncertainty avoidance on the
Hofstede model, thus, relatively high, but on the GLOBE model, the practice score is very
close to the Chinese one, 5.02. However, the value score is 3.85, which is considerably
lower than the Chinese one, but it suggests a bigger contradiction compared to the score
offered by the Hofstede model altogether. Then again, as stated previously by Venaik &
Brewer (2008; 2010), these dimensions might be dissimilar in the two models, even
though the descriptions are almost identical. Hofstede et al. (2010) suggest that Finland
would have a fondness for rules and codes of conduct since uncertainty is abhorred
(Hofstede et al., 2010). The rules would need to be maintained even if they made little
sense in some situations, while a sense of safety, keeping oneself busy, and hard work
are appreciated (Hofstede et al., 2010). To a degree, Chinese individuals who follow
traditional values set by Confucianism and Legalism would appreciate the same virtues
of hard work and following the rules, so it is dependent on the people and their values.
In the Hofstede model, China has very high and very low scores for long-term orientation,
87, and indulgence, 24. Having high long-term orientation score is related to a pragmatic
approach to life: investing in the future via education and actual monetary investments
are valued, truths are everchanging according to the changing contexts, and history and
traditions can be adapted to better fit the current situation, instead of preserving them
(Hofstede et al., 2010). This readiness for adaptation may well stem from the ancient

27

Joonas Pylvinen

teachings of Daoism and Yin Yang, since when change is needed, something new must
grow, because the old cannot, anymore.
A low indulgence score means that the Chinese sacrifice their free time for work and
tend to restrain their desires, leading to a certain degree of negative attitude towards
life in general (Hofstede et al., 2010). This is what Confucianism and, partially, Daoism
has been teaching, explaining the low score. The dimension of future orientation in the
GLOBE model seems to express a medium score of 3.75 in practice, being a bit lower
than on average of 3.85, and the value score is approximately 4.73, lower than on the
average score of 5.49. This dimension is described as investing in the future and delaying
gratification for the future, which may explain why it is close to the GLOBE average in
practice since it is almost the mean between the dimensions of long-term orientation
and indulgence on the Hofstede model (GLOBE Project, n.d.). With scores of 38 and 57
in the dimensions of long-term orientation and indulgence, Finland seems to be the
polar opposite of China. When it comes to the GLOBE model, the Finnish practice score
in the dimension of future orientation is also higher than the correspondent Chinese one
at 4.24, while the value score is also higher at 5.07. According to Hofstede et al. (2010),
being short term orientated means believing in so-called absolute truths and respecting
traditions, while dismissing the chance to invest in the future to a greater degree. Being
more indulgent than not, Finns appreciate self-actualization and leisure time while
adopting a positive outlook on life (Hofstede et al., 2010).
According to the GLOBE model, Chinese society can be said to be performance
orientated with a practice score of 4.45, the score being higher than what the GLOBE
average of 4.1 is. Thus, hard work, high-performance levels, and innovation are
appreciated, also supported by the long traditions set by Confucianism and Daoism
according to which hard work is expected of a leader and doing that sets a role model
for the others. The value score of performance orientation is also high, 5.67, but
curiously enough, it is still lower than what the value score for this dimension is on the
GLOBE average of 5.94. Finland is slightly less practice-oriented in practice with a score
of 3.81, but performance orientation is evenhandedly valued more in Finland with a
score of 6.11.

Lastly, China has nearly a medium practice score of 3.82 in the dimension of
assertiveness, compared to the average score of 4.14. This can be explained with the
desire to avoid conflicts and to save face, but fascinatingly, the Chinese value score for
assertiveness is close to the maximum observed in the GLOBE research, 5.44 compared
to the average of 3.82. Interestingly, Finland has an almost identical practice score of
3.81, while the value score is slightly lower at 3.68. This situation probably stems from
similar communication styles or is the result of them.

3.2.

Chinese culture

This section aims to clarify both the underlying contexts and key concepts in Chinese
culture. To understand what Chinese culture is about, one needs to be aware of the
millennia-long tradition of Chinese schools of philosophy. What is common to all of them
is their goal: to pursue harmony (Ma & Tsui, 2015). The key concepts are related to
phenomena present in all sections of life in China.

3.2.1. Chinese philosophies

Confucianism

Confucianism may well be the most defining philosophy of Chinese culture. It assumes
that people are innately well-meaning, and it has created and upheld many of the values
even in contemporary China, as well as in other neighboring East Asian cultures and
societies (Gilardoni, 2017; Lin et al., 2018). These values include taking an active role
when leading, humility, benevolence, working hard, respect for the authorities, which
has led to hierarchism based on seniority, and, loyalty and obedience towards those
higher in the hierarchy as well (Gilardoni, 2017; Lin, Li, & Roelfsema, 2018; Ma & Tsui,
2015; Vihakara, 2014). In more concrete terms, people should be good children to their
29

Joonas Pylvinen

parents and be good citizens governed by the powers that be, but in turn, parents should
protect and take care of their children, while the government should do the same for its
citizens. I.e., paternalism may be the most important of Confucianist values. Thus,
relationships and loyalty are highlighted (Ma & Tsui, 2015). But, to become a leader, an
individual should have had a comprehensive education and be well-prepared for their
tasks, so learning and knowledge are also valued (Lin et al., 2018).
Like most philosophies, Confucianism advocates a good way of living life, and as such,
harmony and peace are also very important (Gilardoni, 2017). Not living under the
values set by Confucianism and causing public disturbances in harmony instead will lead
to losing face, which can mean, depending on the seriousness of the breach, possibly
even social exclusion (Chen et al., 2018; Gilardoni, 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Vihakara, 2014).
In terms of Confucianist leadership, sacrificing one’s ambitions is encouraged, and the
law should be obeyed instead (Ma & Tsui, 2015).
However, what works in China may be inefficient in other countries: Lin et al. (2018)
reported that while paternalistic leadership is related to high work performances in
China, imposing paternalism on Western employees had negative effects. Nevertheless,
Confucianism is perfectly complementary with modern leadership theories through its
valuation of education, self-improvement, and letting subordinates prosper (Lin et al.,
2018).

Daoism

Another significant Chinese philosophy that subconsciously steers the Chinese people is
Daoism. Coined by the ancient Chinese philosopher Laozi, contemporary to Plato and
Aristotle, the term Dao can be translated to “the path” or “the way,” meaning the way
that nature is, and how inherently good human beings are bound to follow this way of
nature (Bai & Morris, 2014; Lee, Haught, Chen, & Chan, 2013; Ma & Tsui, 2015). One
should refrain from making drastic decisions that would have considerable
consequences to avoid disrupting the natural way of things, and this is wherein the
largest difference compared to Confucianism lies, as Daoism recommends passive
30

Joonas Pylvinen

leadership and refraining from unnecessary work, while Confucianism encourages one
to work hard (Ma & Tsui, 2015). To follow this way is considered virtuous, and it instructs
to act in a compassionate and considerate way towards others, having the same
principles as Western virtue ethics (Bai & Morris, 2014; Lee et al., 2013).
Daoism especially comments on leadership, instructing managers among other people
to be “water-like”, which has several implications:
1) A Daoist manager needs to be beneficent, for water nurtures and nourishes all living
beings without gaining anything itself – a leader should support their subordinates for
no personal gain (Lee et al., 2013 Ma & Tsui, 2015).
2) The manager needs to be humble, for water always flows towards the bottom – a low
profile is appreciated, and humbleness enables the manager to identify and adopt
others’ goals as their own to lead them efficiently (Lee et al., 2013).
3) The manager needs to be able to adapt well, for fluid water can take almost any shape
– changes should be made according to a situation, and rigidity avoided (Lee et al., 2013
Ma & Tsui, 2015). However, too much adaptability depending on the context can be
considered bad – in the research by Lin et al. (2018), Chinese managers regarded Daoism
derived flexibility as something to be avoided, as they were working with Dutch people
who were unadaptable in their experiences. For example, the Dutch wanted to follow
set goals, and keep following them from the beginning until the end, even though
lucrative opportunities presented themselves mid-operations (Lin et al., 2018). The
Chinese did recognize that too much flexibility might jeopardize their expertise in the
eyes of foreigners, but changing this mindset towards a more Western-friendly one does
seem as if they simply adapted to a new environment just according to this principle.
4) The manager needs to be honest, for water is transparent – all kinds of political games
and dishonesty should be avoided (Lee et al., 2013). According to Laozi (1961), “Who
can make the muddy water clear? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear.” (as
cited by Lee et al., 2013, p. 268).
5) The manager should be kind, but tenacious and strong, for a gentle stream of water
will always form a way through any stubborn obstacle (Lee et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2018;
Ma & Tsui, 2015). By following all these principles, a manager or any individual can be
31

Joonas Pylvinen

described as a good leader. By leading by virtuous example, it is possible to win over the
hearts of one’s subordinates and the general masses (Ma & Tsui, 2015). It is also stated
that even though unethical leadership would be successful, the flourishing would be
short-lived due to punishments by society, which is why a virtuous approach should be
adopted (Bai & Morris, 2014).
Interestingly, this philosophy focuses on harmonious relationships between individuals
and even setting oneself lower than them, even if one were their manager since as it
will be seen, power distance and hierarchies are great in China. This kind of leadership
can even be defined as feminine, and it is prevalent in the greater East-Asian region,
even though masculinism is strong within the area, which makes it all the more
fascinating.
Even though Daoism originates in China, the Chinese themselves have failed to perfectly
master it: A study has shown that American students scored higher in some of these
categories than their Chinese counterparts, when measured (Lee et al., 2013). The
philosophy is even compatible with inter-cultural leadership as it focuses on adapting to
surrounding environments and the people’s needs in such a great degree (Lin et al.,
2018). Lin et al. (2018) together with Ma and Tsui (2015) argue that Chinese managers
who have been influenced by this philosophy are more like to believe and practice
laissez-faire leadership, which can be strengthened by enabling subordinates to also
make decisions and have power. Also, Bai & Morris (2014) add that Daoism can
complement any modern leadership theory by offering ameliorated insights into ethical
conduct.

Legalism

Legalism was born during a war-ridden time when Chinese lands were in discord and
order was much needed, which is why legalism disregards the idea of the beneficent
nature of all human beings (Lin et al., 2018; Ma & Tsui, 2015). While Legalism also strives
for harmony, it advocates for establishing a plethora of rules and laws with rewarding
those who follow them without erring instead of positive means, while seriously
32

Joonas Pylvinen

punishing those, who break the rules (Lin et al., 2018; Ma & Tsui, 2015). Legalism also
argues that all power should be centralized and concentrated, so that subordinates’
access to it would be restricted, and selfish purposes of the use of power prevented (Lin
et al., 2018; Ma & Tsui, 2015). This philosophy also states that everyone should be
treated fairly and equally, while even the leaders should be punished if they broke the
rules (Ma & Tsui, 2015).

Yin Yang

According to an ancient Chinese belief, energy, or qi, consists of two parts: Yin, the
black, feminine, and passive one, and Yang, the white, masculine, and active one (Bai &
Morris, 2014). It is said that all energy contains both and that it starts from any of the
two, growing until it cannot grow anymore, and after that, the opposing part of qi will
start to grow (Bai & Morris, 2014). If the previously mentioned term of friction is brought
back for a while, according to Yin Yang, all national cultures are always incompatible
with each other to some degree, but, on the other hand, they are also compatible on
some level (Lin et al., 2018).
Yin Yang leadership is particularly adept at working with paradoxes and contradictory
matters at the same time, why it is considered as an able tool in cross-cultural
management (Lee & Reade, 2018). Yin Yang is especially used to respond to paradoxes
in the Chinese culture, as traditionally, harmony and collectivism have been the most
important values, but they are being challenged by contemporary needs for
individualism and directness, for example (Lee & Reade, 2018). As mentioned, the
traditional values have reached their peak, and those presented by the need for
modernization have been planted, someday growing to greater heights as well.
Lee & Reade (2018) also argue that paradoxes should be adopted, as they are as natural
phenomena, and that managing them is a core requirement for expatriate managers to
have effective stints in China. By nurturing relationships and being benevolent according

33

Joonas Pylvinen

to the virtue of Yin and by being decisive and managing uncertainty and risk through
Yang will bring balanced and successful results (Lee & Reade, 2018).

3.2.2. Key concepts of Chinese culture

As pointed out in a simplified way by Hofstede and many others, China is a collectivistic
society where people are associated and work with an in-group in which the members
have very close ties with one another, and the needs and goals of the group are put
before one’s own (Jia & Rutherford, 2010). This leads to the concept of face and
upkeeping the social harmony whose main function is to protect the honor of one’s
family and community while putting shame on it leads to repercussions issued privately
by the family (Chen et al., 2018; Jia & Rutherford, 2010). Unfortunately, the fear of losing
the aforementioned mianzi, literally face, but, practically social honor, will make the
Chinese avoid public conflicts at all cost, causing them to sometimes make inefficient
decisions when it comes down to sensitive issues, which may be harmful in business
contexts (Chen et al., 2018; Vihakara, 2014). Avoiding loss of face, Chinese usually do act
in a reserved and indirect manner, and they tend to try to solve any possible problems
in private before or after meetings in business contexts (Fang, 2012; Vihakara, 2014).
In comparison, Western ways of thinking stem from the Ancient Greek culture, where
individualism and a strong sense of self were combined with public rhetoric debates,
basically taking the arguing to the center of the culture, which is why the foundation of
Chinese culture is in its core the complete opposite of the Western culture (Gilardoni,
2017). It is been thought that the unique developments were caused by the ancient
professions as well, and since the Chinese were farming rice, which requires a lot of
cooperation, a system had to be developed where the farmers could avoid arguing and
disrupting the farming operations. Because of that, it is no wonder why many consider
Chinese culture one of the most distant cultures there is to westerners.
As westerners tend to analytically think about things, subjects or objects taken away
from their context, the Chinese emphasize the relationships between persons and items

34

Joonas Pylvinen

aided by their collectivistic worldview (Gilardoni, 2017). Even the Chinese language can
be considered as highly contextual, depending not only on the relationships between
singular words, but also on the relationships between the communicator and the
audience as well (Gilardoni, 2017).

Guanxi and trust

Interpersonal relationships in general and the in-group relations are the most
meaningful to the Chinese (Vihakara, 2014; Yao, Zhang, Brett, & Murnighan, 2017).
Chinese people generally see people as either family, familiar, or strangers, the last of
whom they completely distrust (Yao et al., 2017). If an expatriate is considered a
stranger, there will be a lack of interpersonal trust, which, combined with the fact that
the Chinese may want avoid interacting with foreign strangers, will consequently make
conducting business operations effectively in China close to impossible (Yao et al., 2017).
The significance of trust is highlighted due to Chinese people preferring to socially
interact mainly within their families outside of working hours as noted in previous
studies that have recorded high values of Collectivity (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Hofstede et
al., 2010). To grow out of the status of a stranger, to raise trust, and, finally, to be able
to open doors to new opportunities, a foreign manager must partake in building guanxi,
or relational exchanges that lead to interpersonal long-term relationships, the concept
of which is a perfect projection of Chinese collectivism (Chen et al., 2018; Lee & Reade,
2018; Nee, Holm, & Opper, 2017; Vihakara, 2014; Yao et al., 2017). However, the term
“interpersonal relationships” carries weaker nuances than the original word, which is
why guanxi is the preferred word that is usually referred to in Chinese contexts (Jia &
Rutherford, 2010). The way Chinese initiate building relationships with the help of
guanxi is to have a shared base for communication, such as a birthplace, an alma mater
or other education-related institution, or workplace in common, that the relationship is
built upon (Huang & Aaltio, 2014; Lee & Reade, 2018). Yao et al. (2017) commented that
positive experiences, such as friendly discussions and negating negative stereotypes,

35

Joonas Pylvinen

create trust between strangers, which Finnish managers should keep in mind when
interacting with these people.
Unfortunately for foreigners, gaining access to the guanxi circles may be very difficult
due to cultural differences and the lack of trust, and they should refrain from acting as
if they were Chinese to gain inside access, since it is frowned upon (Sarkki, 2017). Instead,
the first meeting between a foreign manager and the person they would like to become
acquainted with would usually have to be arranged by a mutual friend or an
acquaintance, and the relationship will take up from there through saving face and
participating in social obligations, or renqing. For example, participating in formal
banquets or just dining with familiar people are great ways of building mutual guanxi
(Sarkki, 2017; Lee & Reade, 2018; Vihakara, 2014). It should be remembered that these
relationships are governed by the additional concepts of bao and li, or the reciprocity of
receiving and returning favors, and correct, courteous behavior in the relationships (Nee
et al., 2017; Vihakara, 2014). However, this reciprocity may be more complex than
simply exchanging favors between two individuals, as it is common that third parties are
also involved (Yao et al., 2017).
While networking is practically always formal and based on corporate or career interest
in the West, the point with guanxi is to build intimate relations to prove that one is
trustworthy for the new persons (Huang & Aaltio, 2014). Building guanxi can be time
and energy-consuming as the interpersonal relations need to be constantly tended to,
but it is necessary so that the Chinese can become open-hearted and be honest with a
new person (Chen et al., 2018; Nee et al., 2017). Being a foreign manager, mingling both
with one’s peers and subordinates must be done, and failing to do so could be an
unforgivable mistake. Sticking to individualist values will more than likely cause
impersonal relationships to become low quality and competitive in comparison, so there
are guanxi should absolutely be embraced in China.

36

Authority

Another distinctive cultural trait of China is the prevalence of and respect for authority
on all levels of society, which stems from the teachings of Confucius in the ancient era
and that can be described as having a high degree of power distance within the Chinese
culture (Jia & Rutherford, 2010). According to this principle, leaders should have
unquestionable power over their subjects, and the contemporary business leaders do
command a significant authority, but they need to provide for their employees and
protect them in return (Chen et al., 2018). This authority that can be measured by
Hofstede’s power distance also creates a strong hierarchy and an inherent inequality in
the Chinese society that is natural for the Chinese and they almost instantly know their
place in it (Gilardoni, 2017; Vihakara, 2014). The other persons’ age, role at companies,
status, et cetera need to be considered when interacting with the Chinese, and these
unspoken conditions will guide one to act socialize properly with them (Gilardoni, 2017).
As a rule of thumb, and a part of the aforementioned li, or social manners, a foreign
manager should be more polite with older people and those that have a more
prestigious job title than they have. However, the Finnish manager can be more relaxed
with equal peers and act as they would normally do, but within the context of the
Chinese culture, of course. With those that are younger than the manager or having a
lower-ranking job position, the manager can even expect them to carry out favors to the
manager, like having their bags carried out of courtesy. Of course, they need to return
the favor to their elders and senior managers as well according to the rules set by
Confucianism.
Traditionally, high power distance has meant that communication between managers
and employees in China has been dictated downwards from the top, while still involving
and encouraging people, and according to more recent studies, the Chinese implement
a more open and interacting approach influenced by Western culture that is still
authority-based, and it has been stated to lead into higher levels of team participation
(Chen et al., 2018).

Millennials and changing values

What needs to be noted about the traditional values of the Chinese culture is that they
are changing slowly over time. Chinese millennials already hold more inclusive and
egalitarian views than the older generations, having matured in an international and
global world with the Internet and social media (Bucic, Harris, & Arli, 2012; Kurki, 2018;
Tang, Wang, & Zhang, 2017). It has made them prefer lower power distance than the
older generations who lived under Communism (Bucic, Harris, & Arli, 2012; Kurki, 2018;
Tang, Wang, & Zhang, 2017). Since most of them were the only child of their family due
to the one-child policy of the past in China, they have been argued to crave attention
and being less emotionally intelligent than the past generations (Kurki, 2018). This could
also mean that they could be more individualistic and desire to express themselves to a
higher degree. Also, they combine some thoughts from traditional Chinese schools of
thinking but are also influenced by Western leadership theories and they would like their
ideal leader to base their decisions on a logical reasoning process (Kurki, 2018).
The extent to which their views differ from the traditional Chinese culture remains to be
seen, as it will still take time until these people reach the senior management positions
where they will be able to influence leadership culture at a corporate level. Meanwhile,
when these millennials are finishing their studies and picking up jobs, the managers of
older generations may need to make some adjustments if the millennials as a mass of
people resist the status quo (Kurki, 2018). However, changes in the working
environment are not limited to the attitudes of millennials, as employee commitment
levels are sinking in China, mostly due to the quickly changing environments both in the
working life and societal institutions (Lin et al., 2018). However, even though changing
working places seems to be extremely common, becoming unemployed would cause an
individual to lose access to social welfare (Lin et al., 2018). This competitiveness means
that fighting for one’s survival in the current labor market has diminished the
importance of collectivism at the expense of rising feelings of individualism, at least at
work-related environments (Lin et al., 2018).

38

Formal and informal contexts

As discussed before, national cultures can be various things at the same time, depending
on the context. Finnish employees going to China should keep in mind that informal
environments outside of work are very important for developing business relationships.
This can be seen as a part of guanxi, the trust-building process, but outside of the formal
work environment, Chinese become relaxed and less reserved, losing their strong
hierarchical structures, and the activities at these after-work events usually involve
drinking, eating, singing, and even dancing (Fang, 2012).

3.3.

Finnish culture

Key concepts of Finnish culture

Finnish national culture is strongly influenced by Protestant Christian religion during
many centuries, and it is based on numerous key concepts, such as equality, work ethic,
individuality, and truth, or sticking to honestly speaking one’s mind, in no particular
order (Lewis, 2011; Vihakara, 2014; Saviaro, 2007). Truth is an absolute concept to Finns,
and they can be profoundly confused by the Chinese attitude, according to which
multiple truths can exist at the same time (Lewis, 2011; Vihakara, 2014). Admiring the
truth and living for it makes Finns very honest and direct among the nations of the world,
and they also evaluate others based on their credibility and ability to deliver on their
word and promises, while keeping their expectations at a realistic level (Lewis, 2011;
Saviaro, 2007). By proclaiming ultimate truths, Finns and other westerners announce
that other people are ultimately wrong if their views differ, which would be a severe
breach of harmony in China (Vihakara, 2014). However, it is the Finns who would be
offended if the Chinese fail to keep their promises, since verbal agreements are seen
binding, even though not from a legal perspective (Saviaro, 2007).

39

Joonas Pylvinen

Protestantism has also traditionally highlighted the special relationship of individuals
and God, shaping the culture to one that can be described individualistic as the legacy
of the religion (Vihakara, 2014). Thus, the business culture tends to favor honest lowcontext communication, hard work, and people tend to mind their own business at work
unless specifically working in group projects.
Finns are quite formal when conducting business as their focus is on the business aspects
and, thus, they usually want to skip probable small talk, preferring to build relationships
outside of the working context (Saviaro, 2007). Time management is important for them
and they aim to work as much as they can during their working hours, but working
overtime is avoided whenever possible (Saviaro, 2007). Physical presence is unrequired
during meetings and distance meetings can even be preferred.

A sense of uniqueness and isolation

Being different from nearly all their neighboring cultures, Finns are separate and alone
in the world as a cultural group, sharing a common cultural identity only with Estonians
to some degree (Lewis, 2011). Perhaps this sense of solitude is the cause of shyness and
modesty that are important traits in Finnish culture as well and are especially prevalent
in encounters with foreigners (Lewis, 2011). They may regard Finns as unnecessarily
silent, but the Finnish view is that every time one speaks, one should have something
substantial to say, and speaking for its own sake is frowned upon (Saviaro, 2007). Also,
speaking “too much” can cause feelings of doubt in Finns, since they might think that
one tries to cover something by talking a lot (Lewis, 2011). Also, favoring silence leads
to small talk being eliminated at all levels of society in general, including at workplaces
and in business meetings (Vihakara, 2014). However, it is worthwhile to note that the
younger generations are different and, it could be said, louder than the previous ones,
so this silence is changing (Saviaro, 2007).
The isolation itself stems from having a language that is not related to most European
languages, a frontier mentality in a mostly forested land at the edge of Europe, and a
sense of loneliness experienced since their independence when they had to fight for
40

Joonas Pylvinen

their survival as a nation (Lewis, 2011). This fight and facing adversities, in general, give
birth to perhaps the most defining part of Finnish culture, sisu. It cannot be directly
translated in English: Words that are close but lacking in nuance would be grit or guts.
However, the concept represents bravery and tenacity when facing hardships.

Paradoxes within Finnish culture

Paradoxes, as discussed before, also exist in Finnish culture. Even though Finns are
generally warm-hearted, they can be very introverted at the same time. They greatly
value freedom and independence, but the Finnish society has many restrictions and
Finns are known for hesitating to express their opinions. As mentioned, Finland is also
considered a highly individualistic country, but Finns are often concerned about other
people’s opinions and share a similar concept to the Chinese “face”, albeit to a far lesser
degree (Lewis, 2011; Vihakara, 2014).

Finnish communication style and its proximity to East Asian ones

Even though they are mostly Western and European in their ways of thinking, Finns are
coincidentally very close to Chinese and other Asians in their communication style.
Disliking speaking in vain, Finns make for much better listeners than speakers, and they
value silent thinking in conversations (Lewis, 2011). Much like Chinese people do, Finns
are often vague in their speech (Lewis, 2011; Saviaro, 2007). For example, they
frequently use verbs in the passive voice and select impersonal ways of conveying things
while avoiding eye contact, and they prefer to avoid referring to people with their given
names (Lewis, 2011; Saviaro, 2007). The greatest fact in common is that arguments and
strong opinions are usually avoided to avoid disturbing the public harmony, even if Finns
place a weaker emphasis on maintaining that harmony as serious than Chinese people
do (Lewis, 2011). The figure below shows how close Finnish and general Asian
communication styles are, while Finns share Western values instead of Asian ones (Lewis,
41

Joonas Pylvinen

2011). However, the ultimate goal of Finnish communication is to achieve mutual
decisions via compromises, and everyone’s opinion is appreciated, which cannot be said
to be true within Chinese culture (Hofstede et al., 2010). Saviaro (2007) also points out
that Finns can listen and read between the lines, which is common in Chinese contexts
as well, since, as high-context communicators, that is expected of them.

Figure 1 Values and communication styles of USA/West Europeans, Finns, and Asians (Lewis, 2011).

3.4.

Cultural adaptation of expatriate managers to China

Even though China is currently experiencing a continuous and massive social and
economic change, the cornerstone that the country is built upon is its culture that
remains crucial to understand and it can be said to be the key to success within that
country (Gilardoni, 2017). However, since Chinese culture is completely unlike any
Western culture also described as being a “world apart,” professionals heading to China
need to already have an excellent cross-cultural skillset and an ability to adapt to this
alien cultural and social context while being culturally intelligent at the same time
(Gilardoni, 2017; Selmer, 2005). This is surely helped by the fact that Finns are fascinated
by cultural differences in general. They continually compare other cultures to their own,
42

and try to find potential differences, while being tolerant and polite in culturally
challenging situations (Lewis, 2011; Saviaro, 2007). However, it is to be noted that even
if a company, a foreign subsidiary, for example, is situated in a Chinese environment, all
its employees might not be Chinese, which requires even more from the cross-cultural
skills of the manager (Selmer, 2005).
Furthermore, even if an outgoing employee had had cultural adaptation training, the
circumstances in which they work ultimately determine whether the extent of its
usefulness – for instance, the type of organization plays a considerable role (Selmer,
2005). Regrettably, many professionals head to China with dated knowledge or no
knowledge at all as the country is developing so fast that it was completely different just
ten years ago, and the changes have been great in just two to three years (Gilardoni,
2017). Because of this, these managers may think beforehand that there will be no
problems when they are going to China, and they will be surprised to see it is not what
they expected once they arrive there. This kind of approach is especially dangerous as
the damages caused by cultural faux pas are more often than not difficult to amend
(Gilardoni, 2017).
One real stumbling block for mutual understanding in Sino-Finnish business dealings can
be found in the differences between Finnish and Chinese ways of communication, as the
former is low-context and the latter high-context, both of which can seem rude and
confusing to the other party (Vihakara, 2014). Furthermore, Western values clash with
Chinese ones, and forcing Western ways on Chinese managers and employees is a sure
way of insulting them (Vihakara, 2014). This creates a need for an equilibrium
concerning the values and the mindsets influenced by them, and at least partial
adaptation, especially from the Finnish side if they are to conduct business in China –
when in Rome, do as the Romans do. However, Lin et al. (2018) show that the more the
Chinese employees are familiar with and open to many cultures from all over the world,
the more they show commitment to their international employer. So, educating them
in foreign ways may be an effective strategy if it is not overdone.
Nowadays, to succeed, different and more open attitudes should be adopted before
entering a foreign market in which a foreign culture is prevalent. Without understanding
the culture and its contexts, it is impossible to connect well with Chinese people – and
43

Joonas Pylvinen

it needs to be highlighted that China is not a culturally homogenous nation à la Japan,
for instance (Gilardoni, 2017). Much like the USA, China consists of different regions and
peoples who are unified by a similar culture to a certain extent (Gilardoni, 2017).
Regional and economic differences do exist within the country, so marketing and
communication, in general, may be ineffective when not customized according to the
different regions (Gilardoni, 2017). However, in the case of China, not only cultural
factors should be considered, but the economic, institutional, social, and political
themes should be eyed as well (Gilardoni, 2017). By successfully comprehending,
adopting, and integrating both East Asian and Western values, westerners can
significantly improve their cross-cultural management and communication, even in
China (Chen et al., 2018).
Despite the various benefits, many westerners have forgone such adaptation and
chances to learn from the local culture, in addition to failing to heed the advice given by
the local partners or other managers in favor of enforcing their managerial practices
based on their successes in the past, thinking that only their attitude towards a new
environment mattered, and that learning by doing was enough (Gilardoni, 2017; Lin &
Malhotra, 2012; Selmer, 2005). This is highly discouraged as the chances of failing are
high, while long-term success is unattainable without changing perspectives to this
unique cultural area in question, and even though some initial success might be achieved,
the revenues are not as high as they would be through adaptation (Gilardoni, 2017).
Fortunately enough, Finns seem adept to adapt well to cultural differences and being
conscious of them (Lewis, 2011). Lin et al. (2018) also suggest that every foreign
manager should build strong interpersonal relationships with their local Chinese
subordinates while fulfilling their expectations and leading them in a culturally
appropriate way to build trust and increase employee commitment in that way. Oh et
al. (2018) also point out that expatriate managers representing the headquarters of
foreign subsidiaries have the power to shape the impressions of the workforce both in
favor of the headquarters and the local subsidiary, and that reinforcing the positive
image via favorable actions would increase employee commitment. This is especially
important when considering that, as mentioned, employee commitment is decreasing
increasingly in China.
44

Joonas Pylvinen

Lin and Malhotra (2012) state that especially American companies and managers feel
that their need for independence and their need to control the interactions clash
negatively with the Chinese value of interdependency caused by collectivism, thus
resulting in a negative attitude towards cultural adaptation in China. It is hardly
surprising that such companies usually report lower performance levels in their Chinese
branches than in their domestic markets (Gilardoni, 2017).
Surprisingly, according to a study, Americans working in a company whose culture had
high power distance were more interested in the views of their Chinese employees and
integrated these opinions in their solutions to a greater degree, and in a company that
favored collectivism instead of individualism, they developed more trust with the
Chinese (Chen et al., 2018). Thus, organizational culture plays a major role in cultural
adaptation and it should be noted while planning cross-cultural co-operation and
strategies. If possible, building a mixed organizational culture combining values from
both the West and China will help the company to enhance cross-cultural
communication within it and with other companies as well through cooperation or other
interaction (Chen et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2016).
Lin et al. (2018) also argue that by adopting both aspects of Yin and Yang in their
management style, Western managers can address the low Chinese employee
commitment. By manifesting Yang, by appearing strong and assertive, especially during
difficult times, the Chinese employees feel more confident and feel safer in their working
environment (Lin et al., 2018). However, the more traditional Yin and its values of being
considerate and constructive, while tending to the relationships of the employees are
also of value (Lin et al., 2018).
As an additional challenge, Chinese senior managers expect their juniors to hold them
in high regard since the elders are to be respected, even though they sometimes expect
their age and life experience to override the importance of expertise (Selmer, 2005).
These senior managers do not usually have a formal educational background, which is
practically an essential requirement for a manager in the West (Selmer, 2005). If
tensions start to rise due to different values and backgrounds, trust and interpersonal
relationships between Finns and Chinese will inevitably suffer (Gilardoni, 2017). As
communication and interaction between the foreign and the Chinese managers begin
45

Joonas Pylvinen

to diminish, unsuccessful business operations will most probably occur, leading to stress
and blaming the other party for their inability, while they may fail to recognize the part
that they had in it (Selmer, 2005).
According to the study conducted by Lin and Malhotra (2012), higher levels of cultural
adaptation result in an increased performance level, while increasing the satisfaction
level of Chinese employees and decreasing that of westerners. It seems logical, since the
westerners are making more conscious effort in this case to please their Chinese
partners, while the Chinese need to do less at their turf, playing by their own rules. As
an interesting finding, they also found that when the cultural similarities are high
between the two organizations, the Chinese experience dissatisfaction when adapting,
whereas the westerners felt more satisfied in this case (Lin & Malhotra, 2012). This can
be explained by the fact that the Chinese are eager to learn from successful
organizations from the West but think that there is little valuable information to be
learned from more familiar national cultures, such as those of South Korea or Vietnam.
That is why adapting will decrease the levels of satisfaction as a result.
Shortly summarized, there seems to be a beneficial relationship between cross-cultural
adjustment training and the performance of outgoing professionals, such as expatriates,
backed by several studies (Jia & Lamming, 2013; Lin & Malhotra, 2012). Curiously
enough, according to the study by Selmer (2005), receiving cross-cultural training gave
little more advantage to adapting managers than informal sociocultural adjustment
outside working hours did. There was no indication that both receiving the training and
working for your adjustment yourself would be counterproductive, though. This also
supports the earlier presented claim that building strong interpersonal relationships
with Chinese coworkers will help a foreign national to better adapt to Chinese culture.

4 Methodology

4.1.

Research approach

To find profound answers to its research questions, this thesis will employ a qualitative
research method, or more clearly defined, semi-structured interviews. With these kinds
of interviews, it is possible to gain both factual answers and also responses that reveal
something about the interviewees’ attitudes and it is even possible to probe the
interviewees further with their answers when necessary (McNeill & Chapman, 2005;
Sproull, 1995).
Since there were no hypotheses to be tested, but collecting the data required building
the theoretical frame of reference beforehand, an abductive approach to research was
chosen (Awuzie & McDermott, 2017). This approach was deemed fitting as the collected
material defined the frame of reference even more specifically, and there was a
continual shift between the theory and the findings so that connections could be built
(Alasuutari, 2011; Awuzie & McDermott, 2017). The chosen approach also ensured that
the theoretical frame of reference could be so diverse that it could be inspected from
various perspectives, which would consequently reveal new insights (Alasuutari, 2011).
As to the selection of a qualitative research method, the nature of the research
questions in this thesis relates more to the “how” things are done, so answers could not
be easily obtained via quantitative methods that rely on given alternatives when the
scope of the answers was unknown – thus, more profound knowledge about the
behavior of Finnish nationals in China was required (Alasuutari, 2011; Mäntyneva,
Heinonen, & Wrange, 2008). By opting to utilize qualitative methods, more individual
viewpoints and more complex and more expressive answers can be gained (Alasuutari,
2011).

47

Semi-structured interviewing

A semi-structured interview is in a balanced position between a structured interview
with closed questions and an unstructured interview where there are no predetermined
questions and where the interview resembles an informal conversation (Saunders et al.,
2009). There is usually at least a research guide that contains questions arranged into
appropriate themes that the researcher can exploit during the interview and it is
common to record the interviews so that the focus would be on the conversation, not
at writing or other mediums of non-audio recording (Mäntyneva & al., 2008; Saunders
& al., 2009).
This form of research method is fairly flexible and inclusive, as questions can be added
or dropped from the agenda, or asked in a variant order, depending on the specific
interview occasions and the interviewees can speak in a freer fashion and tell the
interviewer unexpected pieces of information, i.e. it is possible to gain sensitive insights
that are difficult to attain by other methods (McNeill & Chapman, 2005; Mäntyneva &
al, 2008; Saunders & al., 2009). Additional questions are even required to be asked to
probe the interviewees further so that deeper data can be acquired through their
explanations and them expanding what they told, which would give better answers to
the research questions (Qu & Dumay, 2011; Saunders & al., 2009).
Closed questions might fail to include the interviewees’ perspectives, which may be
interpreted to mean that the researcher was imposing their point of view on them and
ignored their reality, while the researcher just did not probably consider them – this is
why open questions are more suitable for accessing deeper understandings (McNeill &
Chapman, 2005). That is why such questions were kept at a minimum, and even then,
accompanied by open follow-up questions.
Semi-structured interviews can also sustain smaller sample sizes due to their nature
(McNeill & Chapman, 2005), and they support this research excellently. It is also helpful
that people tend to accept interview requests more often than they are willing to answer
questionnaires, as interviewing feels more personal and offers them an opportunity for
self-reflection without having to write anything (Saunders & al., 2009).
48

Joonas Pylvinen

Semi-structured interviews have their weaknesses and pitfalls as a research method, as
all the other options do as well. The structure may be so loose or even non-existent that
the focus of the interview might move away from the desired themes, so, preparation
and good conversational skills are needed (Qu & Dumay, 2011). Since the material
gathered is unique in each interview, influenced by the relationship between the
interviewer and the interviewee, the repeatability is very low, and the relationship might
even affect objectivity if the interviewer either consciously or subconsciously steers the
interview in a direction they wanted (McNeill & Chapman, 2005). This might happen
even with facial expressions and tones of voice, leading the interviewee towards a
certain direction. People also tend to respond in such a way that it makes them look
better, and agree with the interviewer more than disagree, to leave a pleasant
impression, while they might not even be describing their reality, either by lying or
believing what they say is true (McNeill & Chapman, 2005). Thus, face-to-face interviews
were preferred so that physical communication could be read as well. However, most
conducted interviews were done over the phone because of the special circumstances
caused by the 2020 Corona outbreak, which is not entirely unproblematic. Since there
were no physical clues, such as body language and facial expressions, analyzing the data
is more difficult, in general (McNeill & Chapman, 2005). Also, if both persons do not
share a common native language the number of misunderstandings could increase while
interviewed over the phone. It was not a major factor since the telephone interviews
were conducted in the native language that both the interviewer and the interviewees
shared, except in one case. The analysis did take more time than analyzing face-to-face
interviews for the aforementioned reasons, but the quality of data remained stable, as
follow-up inquiries were sent per email when needed.

4.2.

Data quality

There are several factors out there that can tamper with the quality of the collected data,
which should be revised before going out there to conduct the interviews and afterward.
These factors relate to the reliability of the data, different biases, and the validity and
49

Joonas Pylvinen

the generalizability of the data (Saunders & al., 2009), all of which are discussed below
in greater detail. Before assessing the credibility of the study after the data has been
collected, preparations can be made to assure that these issues with data quality can be
evaded (Saunders & al., 2009).
When conducting the interviews, the researcher must know both their research topic
and the organization whose manager they will interview, and it is helpful that these
managers are provided with the list of the interview themes beforehand so that they
can better prepare for the interview (Saunders & al., 2009). The interview locations
should be comfortable both for the interviewer and the interviewee, and they should be
in such places where the risk of disruptions is minimized (Saunders & al., 2009). The
telephone interviews took place in peaceful environments, and the face-to-face
interviews at cafés, so that the interviewees could feel themselves comfortable. Shensul
et al. (1999) also suggest that the interviewer should keep the conversation flowing with
little stops, by, for example, avoiding ‘yes-no’ questions, taking a friendly approach to
the interview, and they should remain as unbiased as they possibly can (as cited by Qu
& Dumay, 2011). The flow of the conversations turned out to be as described, and in
some cases the interviewees could even talk for extended periods of time while they,
unbeknownst to them, answered other questions and even follow-up questions when
they were sharing their experiences without prompts.
The first minutes of the interview are also vital both for the first impression and for
clarifying potential uncertainties, which in turn will lead to gaining the managers’
consent and trust (Saunders & al., 2009). This was done in form of some small talk and
by sharing some personal information to ease the atmosphere. During the interviews
themselves, the interviewer should maintain a neutral attitude, speak clearly and stray
away from excessively theoretical questions while avoiding comments and facial or body
expressions that could lead into biases, while remaining present and interested in what
the manager has to say (Saunders & al., 2009). If interviewing someone of another
cultural background, the interviewer must know they can be misunderstood, and they
can misunderstand the intentions of the interviewee due to cultural differences
(Saunders & al., 2009). Thus, the interviews of the Chinese managers were analyzed with
thought and more time to interpret what they meant in unclear situations. Since they
50

Joonas Pylvinen

had already lived in Finland for long periods of time, no such misunderstandings were
detected.

4.3.

Data collection

The interviews that act as the primary data for this thesis were conducted in FebruaryMarch 2020. The interviewees included Finnish managers, most of whom were
expatriates, and a current CEO that during the time was not a part of the management.
Also, two Chinese managers who have studied and gotten their degrees in Finland were
contacted. They have afterward had managerial positions in the country, thus, knowing
aspects of both Chinese and Finnish working cultures. The interviews of the two Chinese
managers support the bigger picture formed by the statements by the Finnish nationals.
Most of these interviews were conducted via phone calls, and a couple of them via faceto-face meetings, lasting between 35 minutes and over one hour. All the interviews were
also recorded by permission for analysis. The original number of face-to-face meetings
was to be higher in proportion, however, due to the 2020 Corona outbreak, some of
these meetings were canceled and the interviews were done over the phone instead.
Meeting face-to-face offered a tangible context for the interviews, and a chance for a
proper introduction and small talk before commencing the interview, while it was also
possible to have a closing conversation after the interview ended. Thus, it was
regrettable that the proportion of face-to-face interviews was not higher.
The interviewees were selected on the basis that they had working experience in
Chinese business contexts and that they had also been in manager positions. One of
them entered her position as a CEO only after returning, but she introduced herself to
her current industry while in China. Preferably, these Finns’ stints in China should also
have taken place within the past five years, so that their experiences and insights were
still fresh in their minds. This was the case, except in a couple of exceptions. These
people were contacted and briefed via email, and some of them received the interview
guide if requested. Ultimately, the final roster of interviewees included all kinds of

51

Joonas Pylvinen

people whose experiences in China were concentrated in the provinces of Beijing
Municipality, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai Municipality. Besides, the Chinese
nationals that were interviewed originated from the provinces of Guangdong and Hong
Kong. Since both were from Southern China, it would have been interesting to be able
to talk with someone from Northern China as well, which could not regrettably be done.

The interviewees

Eight managers were interviewed in total for this study (see Appendix 1), six of which
were Finnish and the other two Chinese. All the people involved in the interviews are
referred to with sobriquets in this text to protect their anonymity. The companies where
they work are similarly unnamed either for the sake of confidentiality. Lastly, all the
Finnish managers had left China by the time of interviewing.
The first interviewee was Sofia, who was an exchange student in Southern China before
she landed a job first as a trainee, then as an operational excellence expert at a large
Finnish manufacturing company that has a subsidiary in Jiangsu province. She worked
with the management team of the local factory for a little over one year in Jiangsu,
improving the local production processes before recently returning to Finland. Sofia is
also a bilingual in Russian, influenced by the culture of her other native language, which
may have impacted her answers.
Matias worked as an operations manager at another large manufacturing company, also
located in Jiangsu. He supervised the local factory and acted as technical support for the
Chinese sales department of his company. He had lived in other European locations in
advance but moving to China was a completely new experience for him. He worked for
a bit under two years before returning to Finland.
Joel was a general manager at the same large manufacturing company where Sofia got
her experience of working in China. Their stay in China overlapped partly when Joel
resided in Jiangsu province, but he had previously been in Shanghai as well. He was no
stranger to an expatriate lifestyle, having also worked in another East Asian location and
52

Joonas Pylvinen

South America before going to China. He spent nearly four years in total in China, and
for the time being, he is working in Finland.
Noora is the CEO of the company of her own, and she has had a long international career,
starting with studying abroad. As a bilingual in English as well, she had worked as a
teacher at a Southern Chinese business school, and a Beijing state school in the past.
During her stay in China, she acquainted herself with the industry she is currently
affiliated with, and since that, she has worked and lived in several other continents as
well.
Elias has had a long career in the Finnish public sector, having worked as a preschool
director and as a digitalization planner, for example. However, he took the chance to
work as a private preschool director in Beijing, when he saw an opportunity arising. He
had not previously worked abroad, and the company he worked in China for almost two
years was Chinese. Even though he worked at a Chinese pre-school, it was a private
company, nonetheless: His work assignments included direct supervision of most of the
staff, making decisions on budgets and acquisitions, and participating in the board
meetings.
Amanda has built her career in Finland as well, but she became involved in China due to
the expansion policies of her company. She has not lived in the country while working
with Chinese issues, but in her own words, she has spent numerous periods that could
last anything from one week to a few weeks in China in the past years. She could not
regrettably disclose a more exact number. Her stints have taken place in Beijing and
Shanghai, but also in Taiwan, which is outside of the scope of interest for this study.
Of the two Chinese interviewees, Mei came to Finland from Guangdong province in
China approximately ten years ago and had her education at Finnish higher education
institutes. She has not worked at Chinese companies, but her current job at a large
Finnish industrial company offering services, inter alia, had taken her back to work as a
product sales manager in Shanghai, China until the 2020 epidemic. However, she feels
like she is a part of both Chinese and Finnish culture at this point.
Kelly was a social media manager at a micro-sized telecommunications company in
Finland. She has spent nearly eight years in Finland, first coming as an exchange student,
53

Joonas Pylvinen

before returning to study a bachelor’s degree in its entirety. After she graduated, she
left for Hong Kong to gain some work experience, but after a while, she came back to
Finland to study in a master’s degree program. After graduating, she has decided to stay
in Finland for the time being.

The structure of the interviews

The interviews followed an interview guide (see Appendix 2) that consisted of five or six
themes, depending on the person. The purpose of the guide was to give the interviews
a structure to follow, but the conversations did not necessarily include all the prethought questions or had some questions that came up during the interviews
themselves. The themes in question were:
1. Background information
2. Pre-knowledge about the culture before the assignment
3. Preparations for the assignment
4. Life during the assignment
5. Repatriation
There was also a sixth theme for the Chinese interviewees the purpose of which was to
inquire about the differences between different regions in China. Finnish was spoken in
all the interviews save for one, where English was used. The choice was based on the
comfortability of the interviewees in the selected language.
The interviewees played a great role in forming the structure of the interviews, since
some were playing by the rules, i.e. awaiting and answering questions that were posed
to them, while some took a more active role, recounting a great deal and the pace of
the interview needed to be controlled by well-timed questions and probes.

Data analysis

Preparing the analysis

After conducting each interview, the recordings were uploaded onto a secure and
verified cloud service in addition to keeping the original files intact on their recording
devices, which was done to prevent accidental loss of primary data. Since qualitative
research does not offer universally applicable answers, the gathered data were the
impetus based on which both singular observations and connections to the theory were
searched for, with especially new insights in mind (Qu & Dumay, 2011). It is good to
remember that generalizations are not the main objective of qualitative research. What
is most important is to question old ways of thinking and increase the understanding of
the subject (Alasuutari, 2011).
The analysis included processing the data and thinking about its contents, which
commenced by transcribing it to the form of text-based on the audio recordings
(Saunders & al., 2009). The information contained by the text is to be read carefully, to
be arranged and classified according to the similarities and peculiarities that are present
in the data (Guest, MacQueen, & Namey; 2012). By comparing this material to the
theoretical frame of reference, the analysis ultimately produced more data in the form
of research results (Saunders & al., 2006). These findings consequently had an impact
on the theoretical frame of reference, which was adapted according to the findings, and
then the findings were re-examined using the new frame, as suggested by the abductive
research approach (Awuzie & McDermott, 2017).
When analyzing the data, the bigger picture and generally recognized things with
obscure details were in the focus (Alasuutari, 2011). However, the analysis could reveal
some factors in individual interviews that suggested the existence of repeating
phenomena, which were reflected on with the help of the theoretical frame of reference
(Awuzie & Mc Dermott, 2017).

55

Transcribing and coding the data

An adequate amount of time should be saved for transcribing, since each interview can
potentially take hours to transcribe, depending on the length and the type of the
interview and the speed and clarity of the speech (Saunders & al., 2009). The audio
recordings containing the primary data for the thesis were transcribed indeed within
one week after the completion of the interviewing process at the speed of two
transcriptions per day at maximum. A technique known as basic transcription was
chosen but slightly tweaked. The transcriptions included the complete transcripts of the
speech, including expletives, repetitions, pauses, incomplete syllables, and utterances,
et cetera (Saaranen-Kauppinen & Puusniekka, 2006). The lengths of pauses were not
marked, however. For quoting purposes, the transcripts were transformed into written
language. The original Finnish interviews were also translated into English in a style that
attempted to match both the formality of the study and the informality of the interviews.
The technique was chosen on the basis that one should rather be too precise than
careless when transcribing, as even the transcriber has trouble analyzing bad transcripts
well. Also, the level of the transcription is not usually given but decided by the
researcher according to their own needs. No matter which level is chosen, the transcript
should be logical and precise from the start until the finish and what matters most, is
that not only should the answers of the interviewees be transcribed, but preferably also
the tones and ways in which the gave them while including the non-verbal
communication as well, combining all of this with the context of the interview, if possible
(Saunders & al., 2009).
After the data were transcribed, a method known as coding was applied to the
transcriptions next. Coding the data means that it is marked with different colors or
symbols, so that processing and arranging it would be easier (Nowell, Norris, White, &
Moules, 2017; Saunders & al., 2009). This step is described as optional, but helpful, since
it helps the researcher to find observations much faster than if they skipped coding the
text.
The transcripts were coded by the following colors and indications:
56

Joonas Pylvinen

1) Gray color indicated cultural differences between China and Finland, Chinese
subcultures, and other cultural information. 2) Light blue indicated chances for cultural
adaptation, factors that improve cultural adaptation, and attempts at cultural
adaptation. 3) Yellow indicated difficulties and obstacles in cultural adaptation. 4) Green
indicated ways to overcome cultural differences, successful deeds of cultural adaptation,
and insights gained abroad. 5) Dark blue indicated cultural similarities. Finally, 6) red
indicated problems concerning returning and re-adaptation.
These codes try to correspond to the research questions and offer both new insights
into the subject while tying the data in the theoretical background.

Analysis and interpretation

At this phase, connections were built between the codified data, and they were also
matched with the theoretical background, allowing for the identification of possible
similarities, dissimilarities, and even paradoxes. Consequently, a form of analysis called
thematic analysis was chosen, since certain general and common themes kept repeating
themselves and surfaced from the data (Guest et al., 2012; Nowell et al., 2017). Thus,
the data were categorized according to the themes that can be found in the findings.
These findings were compared with the theory, as mentioned, and the progress created
new information that was subjected to interpretation. Initially, some themes seemed
distinct from the research questions, but through rigorous analysis, they were tied to
the theoretical frame of reference that did not remain static throughout the process,
however. As Nowell et al. (2017) suggest, the themes, such as difficulties faced during
foreign assignments and preparations done before those assignments, were revisited
and refined, which allowed for a cohesive narrative to form.

4.5.

Trustworthiness of the research

After having completed the data analysis and achieving the results, the question remains
if the research was a credible one. When conducting qualitative research, it is assumed
already in the beginning that the results will be subjective to a certain extent, which is
why the credibility of what they did, or the lack thereof is present in the entire research
(Alasuutari, 2011; Saunders et al., 2009). To analyze the trustworthiness, the reliability
and the validity of the research must be examined, as they together form credibility
(Saunders et al., 2009).
The main threats to the reliability of a qualitative study all pertain to various
interpretational errors and biases, more specifically, subject or participant error, subject
or participant bias, and observer error and bias (Saunders et al., 2009). Subject or
participant errors happen due to having different results when performing the research
under certain circumstances that can affect the research, while subject or participant
biases will occur if the interviewees answer in such a way that they presume that the
interviewer wants to hear, or in a way that represents their companies the best, even
though it could be false (Saunders et al., 2009). It can be confidently stated that the
influence of surrounding circumstances was minimized during the interviews, as most
of them were conducted over the phone anyway, and no signs of uncomfortableness
were to be seen during the face-to-face interviews. There were neither any signs of
dishonesty to be detected.
Secondly, the validity of the research reflects the logic of the cause-and-effect
relationships within the study (Saunders et al., 2009). The objective of the study is not
to create a universal and generalizable theory, but to try to explain the perspective of
reality that the results of the study depict while avoiding logic leaps and false
assumptions (Alasuutari, 2011; Saunders et al., 2009). What it means in terms of this
thesis is that while the findings may show something curious about the cultural
adaptation of the Finnish nationals in Chinese business contexts, it might be invalid, and
most certainly is, if the nationalities were to be replaced by some other ones – the theme
of generalizability is being approached, once again. It must also be considered that some
58

Joonas Pylvinen

of the interviews might contain partly invalid data, as the responders could alter the
answers, potentially basing them on some ideal fantasy, as discussed above. To ensure
that the interviewees were honest with their answers, trust was built with them with
small talk and building rapport beforehand, as described before. Also, it must be noted
that the audio recordings included moments where the interviewees’ voice cracked or
was lost, so some words were consequently missing. Lastly, but not least, while the
analyzed data was being interpreted, extreme caution was exercised (Saunders et al.,
2009). Since these data would be compared to the theoretical frame of reference, that
framework must be solid so that no incorrect deductions would be made (Saunders et
al., 2009).
What was helpful in terms of knowing the contents of the theoretical frame of reference
was that a prolonged engagement as described by Lincoln and Guba (1985) was
established between the author and Finnish and Chinese cultures. The author is of
culturally Finnish origin, having native-level knowledge of Finnish culture. While he had
no natural affiliations with Chinese culture, the author still had minored in East Asian
studies, worked with Chinese related issues, and studied Mandarin Chinese for nearly
three years, granting him a basic level knowledge on the Chinese national culture.
In addition to this, the topics were further studied, and the interviewees’ backgrounds
were also considered during the interviews. If feasible, their working history and current
companies were studied as well before conducting the interviews, working towards the
diversity and triangulation of data as well (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
As part of peer debriefing (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), the thesis was also presented to and
commented on during various seminars throughout the fall semester of 2019 and the
spring semester of 2020 by peers and supervisors alike. Changes were made according
to the received suggestions, contributing to the final layout of this work.
Lastly, member checks were done to a degree (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). If there was
something puzzling that needed additional information during the analysis process, it
was directly asked from the interviewees, and each of them were promised to be
provided with the results of the study after its publication. Thus, all the described actions

59

aimed to improve the credibility of the research, and to minimize potential errors, such
as described in the beginning of the section.

5 Analyzed findings of the study

5.1.

The context of the Finnish interviewees in China

Sofia

Having studied some Mandarin in high school, Sofia ended up in China as an exchange
student before applying to the local subsidiary of a large Finnish company nearby to
write her master’s thesis while working there. She wanted to write her thesis outside of
Finland, and since she could not study Chinese in her university, she thought that the
best way to learn it would probably be to go to China. Learning the basics in the language
aided her partially in reducing cultural and psychic distance while living in the country.
Sofia spent six months in Nanjing and was exposed to many of the peculiarities within
Chinese culture during that time, which prepared her for her working period. She noted
on the first clashes between the Finnish and the Chinese ways:
“There were lots of such things that… that I did in a Finnish way, but when no one had not really informed
me well, then I, for example, arranged myself an apartment of my own, and then I found out that I should
have stayed at a dormitory, and then we tried to compromise with it for a while […].”

In the end, she stayed at the dorm, but these strong individual opinions and readiness
for arguing are typical of westerners and it is likely that Chinese either give in to these
arguments or just ignore or avoid them to maintain public harmony (Gilardoni, 2017).
Westerners should keep this in mind while in China.
Being a part of a small group of four foreign students in her university, they were
constantly approached and asked to be friends on WeChat, et cetera. As clarification,
WeChat is the most popular social media platform in China with over one billion active
60

Joonas Pylvinen

monthly users. While Sofia did not use WeChat to seek information per se, she had
conversations with Chinese people, such as with her coworkers, which gave her access
to cultural information in passing. This aided her cultural adaptation in the process, as
suggested by Zaw (2018). In addition to that, the Chinese HR manager at her company
usually helped her by telling her about cultural differences, when she did not understand
why people acted the way they did, for example.
Sofia did not have much information about the working culture in China in advance,
except for some pieces of information she received during her high school Chinese
classes. When she attended a Chinese summer course, most participants there were
engineers with work related to China and they told her some stories as well. She recalls
hearing more about the working culture during her exchange studies, including
information about hierarchy and corporate dinners that could sometimes involve a lot
of alcohol:
“… so, these kinds of stuff never came up, because the company was Finnish, so it was a bit different
keeping that in mind… for example, if (I) had gone straight to work at a Chinese company… there might
have been a big difference, then.”

After finishing her time in China, Sofia concluded that a year in China felt like three in
Finland in terms of the amount of different matters and events at the company. Working
there was more exhausting in a way since every day something unpredictable happened
and the baseline of her work changed. This made her think about some out-of-the-box
solutions to solve the surprising situations. These changes could be explained with the
scores of Hofstede and GLOBE models on the dimensions of long-term orientation,
indulgence, uncertainty avoidance and performance orientation. Since changes are
readily adopted and innovation preferred, the working environment could change
accordingly, and people are expected to work hard for the intended results at the
expense of their leisure time. At the same time, pragmatism is favored instead of
universal solutions.
Sofia feels like working in a different culture and seeing different ways of working gave
her a larger perspective on intercultural work, though. She also learned how to prioritize
which battles to fight for since there is not enough time and energy for everything due

61

Joonas Pylvinen

to cultural differences. Her time there made her think more about how people may react
to different situations, words, and even the ways that words are said:
“[…] (I) thought about (the reaction) in my mind before saying something… if I was in a difficult
communication situation, then (I) was thinking more in my mind how to express this thing in a way that
will help me get the answer I want… and… I think that is such a thing that people will learn by doing work
by concentrating on that, but I also think that by working in China, I learned it faster in a way […]”

Thus, Sofia opted for a more indirect, high-context style of communication and adapted
in a way that gave her the ability to appear courteous and to save face better, as
described by Vihakara (2014).

Matias

Matias had worked at his company for five years, when he found out that there was an
internal search for a production manager in China, and he applied for the position, being
chosen after a while. Being well-traveled and having lived abroad before, he was curious
and interested to see how things are done in China, which motivated him to apply.
Having experiences of living outside of Finland helped him to reduce the psychic distance
even in China. In a similar way as stated in Jun et al. (2001) and Oh et al. (2018), being
motivated for the assignment potentially reduced the negative feelings Matias
experienced while he resided in the country.
Matias’ knowledge of Chinese culture, and China, in general, was superficial and based
on assumptions before he left for his assignment. It is somewhat surprising, considering
that he had been in contact with people who worked with issues related to China at his
company. In addition to that, Matias knew little about the local working culture.
Matias stated that he had looked for some information and reading about China after
he was chosen for the foreign manager position, but admitting he did little work with
that. His company decided to organize no cultural training for him, and he would like to
remind that he was among the first expatriates that had originated in the Finnish parent
company. Therefore, he had to learn in practice. He highlighted the importance of

62

Joonas Pylvinen

learning and reading even more information and starting to study the language well
ahead of time. Matias himself knew no Mandarin in advance:
“No, I could not (speak Mandarin) and I cannot really now, either, and I actually blame myself for that a
bit, since I talked a lot with Finns and expats mainly from Europe, and those who were the most successful
had started to study it (Mandarin), let us say, half a year beforehand, so, maybe they have had a better
urge to learn and continue to study it in China for whole that time.”

Matias reminded that he had a six-month-old child when he and his family left for China,
so the six months leading up to the departure were an unsuitable time for building a
strong motivation to study Chinese in the evenings.
However, Matias feels like coming home caused more anxiety than going to China. It
was partly caused by feelings of disappointment when the time at a new and exciting
place had come to an end, and he would return to the same point that he left from:
“[…] the Chinese rhythm of life is a lot, especially at work, a lot, a lot faster, and that clock speed is higher,
so, all the time (things) happen faster and it feels like your heart beats faster as well. When you will come
to Finland, everything takes time and nothing happens, so it is rather a concrete (thing), you will come at
a Finnish workplace, so, everything is a lot slower and that is quite a surprising shock…”

Matias feels like Chinese are similar to Finns in their core, having worked for a long time
with them and spent many an evening together with them. However, there are strong
models of thinking imposed on the Chinese at home, by the schooling system, and by
the society. He feels as if he had the chance to understand their thoughts by challenging
both his Finnish ways of thinking and their ways of thinking. Therefore, he had
successfully reduced the experienced psychic distance while in China.
Matias strives to continue maintaining the speed and effectiveness that he faced in
China, which was probably due to high Performance Orientation in the culture as
depicted in the GLOBE model.

Joel

Joel had already worked as an expatriate in various countries when his former supervisor
asked him to come to China for a second stint. These experiences of working as an
expatriate in different locations had also contributed how he felt distances between his
63

Joonas Pylvinen

culture and other cultures, and the fact he had worked in China before had already
decreased the perceived social distance, aiding his adaptation. First, he was in Shanghai
for two years, and then, he took up his former supervisor’s position in Jiangsu province
for another two years. During his first time working in China, Joel got to know Shanghai
and Beijing, and he already knew about the practicalities of China. He has always
preferred to go somewhere for a longer time to better understand the local culture,
customs, and tasks at work. Even though he has had the option of going to a lot of
countries for just a week at a time, he has declined the chances in favor of longer stints.
Joel received no cultural training for his second time in China in advance, but during this
time there was a two-day familiarization event in China. In practice, there was a Western
consult who had a course about “the collision of cultures.” There was a group of both
Western and Chinese people who were faced against each other, and the consult
brought some cultural differences up in a comedic way. Joel remarked that he probably
would mostly have forgotten the course if it did not include both Chinese and Finnish
people. He pondered that if it were organized in Finland, it may have had been
completely different.
Aside from this, Joel’s employer organized no compulsory training, but he added that if
he had wanted to, he probably could have had access to some training. His company
had hired a consultant company to take care of the paperwork and other daily errands
that he could contact if there was something he needed to know, but there were not
any greater problems he needed help with. This resonates with the former experiences
of Finnish companies in China, as it was stated that such technical difficulties are one of
the most significant problems in the country (Kaitila & Kotilainen, 2017).
Joel knows little Mandarin Chinese, which he considered strange since he has a Chinese
wife now. Their relationship surely further reduced psychic distance and increased his
cultural knowledge of the country. He remarked that he was fine with speaking just
English, and that the international environments in Shanghai and Jiangsu aided him to
survive without speaking Mandarin.
Like Sofia, Joel pointed out that the most interesting aspect of working in China is that
there are no two similar days, meaning that surprises will need to be expected. He
64

Joonas Pylvinen

pondered that if someone hot-tempered went there, those changes would probably be
too much for them and that working there for extended periods could make you numb
to it. He felt slightly relieved coming back to Finland, not because of leaving China, but
because of knowing that he could return home when some expatriates have never
broken out of that lifestyle.

Noora

Noora had no experiences of working abroad before she applied for a position at a
private business school in Guangzhou, Guangdong. Despite that, she had traveled a lot
and already studied abroad, which helped her reduce the psychic distance on some level
even when staying in China. Noora wanted to go there, because she had graduated and
she wanted to do something else in her life, having no prior knowledge of the country.
Noora studied Chinese culture little in advance since she wanted to embrace the culture
as it was, and to form no preconceptions about the culture before experiencing it
firsthand:
“Well, I have always been more, like, about… that setting too many prejudices… and familiarization, well…
[…] it is not really good for your mind when you can find so much information these days… so, (the best
way) of all is when you just indulge (in it).”

The approach she chose enabled her to avoid possible confirmation biases mentioned
by Baack et al. (2015), according to which facing new information that conflicts one’s
former beliefs is harder to process and to adjust to.
She also feels that the most important thing when going abroad is the ability to turn off
your own culture, so to say, and to see the country for just what it is, and nothing else,
to put yourself in the people’s shoes. This type of attitude is a beneficial factor in
decreasing social distance, and thus, psychic distance between the cultures, aiding her
adaptation process.
Noora received no formal cultural training at her school, apart from an informal studentorganized cultural night for the international teachers. When she worked in the business
school, Noora was teaching both business and business English classes. She studied
65

Joonas Pylvinen

neither Cantonese nor Mandarin except for a little during her time there. If she needed
help with something, her students and the other teachers gave her instructions, and
these interpersonal relationships helped her to better adapt to the Chinese environment.
This resonates with previous literature (Jia & Lamming, 2013; Jia & Rutherford, 2010;
Weck & Ivanova, 2013) that highlights the importance of forming interpersonal
relationships in China, and in similar developing and emerging markets, in general.
Noora remarked that returning home from China caused her few issues. She said that
the best way to live in China is to avoid taking the cultural differences to the heart but
treating them with humor instead. She feels as if her time in China taught her humility,
avoiding judging others, and to listen and to appreciate others more. These values may
be explained by the Chinese Hofstede and GLOBE scores on collectivism and humane
orientation that are higher than the Finnish ones, but also by the principles of Daoism
and Yang that promote kindness and appreciating others.

Elias

Elias had worked mostly in municipal positions, as a pre-school director and as a
digitalization planner related to childcare, before he noticed an advertisement for the
position of a pre-school director in a private pre-school with a Finnish concept in China
and he became interested in it. Elias admits that he first completed the application just
for laughs, but then, as he was invited to an interview, he became more serious and
excited about the project:
“… I had always somehow dreamed about going to work abroad and… to see what it is like… and in my
field, there truly are very few such occasions when there is an opportunity to leave. If you are a pre-school
director, then you will be a pre-school director until your retirement, that situation is not going to change.”

Elias landed the position, and thus, he relocated to Beijing. He had little knowledge
about Chinese culture beforehand, and he knew little about the working culture as well:
He only knew that the Chinese are hard workers. The company organized no cultural
training, but he received help from the HR manager of the company in some practical
issues. Elias knew no Mandarin either and he also had some challenges with English,
66

Joonas Pylvinen

since he had never needed to actively use it as a working language. This is problematic
when considering that language fluency is a requirement for mutual trust (BarnerRasmussen & Björkman, 2007). Since Elias’ cross-cultural skillset via education or
experience was weak, his ability to adapt and experience less psychic distance may have
been negatively influenced as a result, as suggested by Gilardoni (2017) and Selmer
(2005).
Having spent nearly two years in China, he returned to Finland and admitted that he
would probably have disliked the idea of living there for a longer period. Elias’
perception of Chinese culture was somewhat negative, which indicates that his crosscultural motivation suffered as a result in China (Oh et al., 2018). It may consequently
have hindered his adaptation process as well. What he learned in China was that you
can survive from all kinds of challenges and he got brave enough for other similar
experiences in the future.

Amanda

Amanda worked at a Finnish company that had expanded its operations in the Chinese
market, which belonged to her area of responsibility, to such an extent that she needed
to go on numerous business trips, even though she was had no experience of working
as an expatriate:
“They (stints in China) were always counted in weeks, you never went to China for just a day, but weeks.
But these stints happened really often.”

As she was no expatriate, the company arranged no training for her, and she went there
with little preparation. She had no preconceptions about Chinese culture or the working
culture besides what a Chinese subordinate in her team had told her and advised her:
“[…] they (the employee) had been to Finland a lot, so, in a way, the threshold to go there was lower, but
some basic things were advised to me […]”

This attitude was helpful for Amanda as it enabled her to experience less psychic
distance to Chinese culture. She was also helped by the fact that her local coworkers
were very Western in their ways of acting, and they knew how Western companies
67

Joonas Pylvinen

worked, which aided cross-cultural communication. She is also an open-minded
individual, which she thanks for experiencing no cultural shocks. What she learned in
China was that life is somewhat similar after all since the same regularities worked there.
She stated that it is easier to go there and other different places now after that epiphany.
In the end, she could reduce her psychic distance to such a degree that she could see
similarities behind the obvious differences on the surface.

5.2.

Differences between Finnish and Chinese working cultures

Hierarchy

Hierarchy is a significant factor in Chinese workplaces. According to Sofia, it is customary
that hierarchies are strictly followed in China, and if a supervisor has said that something
will or will not be done, that order will be obeyed. The statement corresponds to
previous literature (Gilardoni, 2017; Lin et al. 2018; Ma & Tsui, 2015; Vihakara, 2014)
that claims the heritage of Confucianism is strong in Chinese culture, advocating
obedience and respect for those ranking higher in power.
“[…] I think that at our place it was in a way… not that hierarchic, ultimately, just because the company is
Finnish […]”

In companies that have a company culture of a Finnish origin but that are located in
Chinese business contexts, employees from both Finland and China need to culturally
adapt, at least to a certain degree, since such organizational culture consists of mixed
values. Chen et al. (2018) together with et al. (2016) stated that having such an
organizational culture with mixed values would lead to mutual benefits, such as
improved cross-cultural communication and trust between the two parties. The process
is aided by the fact that Finns tend to acknowledge cultural differences well and adapt
to them accordingly. Meanwhile, Chinese people are also especially open to Western
cultures, and they are keen on adapting to them as promoted by Daoism as well, if not
overdone (Lewis, 2011; Lin & Malhotra, 2012; Lin et al., 2018).

68

Joonas Pylvinen

Sofia stated that even though she and her group of Finnish exchange students had
attracted attention while at the campus, it was her young age that got people’s attention
at work. She recounted that younger employees in China usually have no work
experience when they graduate from universities, which leads them to not know what
to do:
“In China, they wait for someone to come and tell them, ‘Do this, this, and this now.’ And that was
something that I did not fully understand in the beginning… or realize […] nothing will happen… unless
(you) do not give them some very specific instructions… and then they might just sit down and wait for…
the new instructions to come (laughs)…”

So, Sofia could see that these Chinese employees lacked initiative, and when she took
initiative and went to ask questions to her Chinese coworkers, they were surprised. She
could also outright tell people that she failed to understand something, or she could
even argue with them, which is again typical behavior for the Finns and low-context
communication. Mei connected the lack of initiative to the fear of doing something
wrong. She also pointed out that not all Chinese are passive like that, but some are very
proactive and come back with more questions and ideas about the tasks.
Matias acknowledged that he is in his mid-thirties and he does his daily work
assignments well, but, in his experiences, a person’s age is still a factor in China:
“[…] if (I) were like a 60-year-old grayhead, and said that things are like this, then the Chinese would listen
to what I say with a completely different ear…”

This is also due to Confucianism and a respect for senior managers, who sometimes lack
expertise making certain decisions, even though a leader should be educated and have
the expertise for their tasks, as Confucianism also declares (Lin et al., 2018). However,
due to their age, their will is done without being questioned (Selmer, 2005). Foreign
managers also expected to be especially polite with their seniors and those who have
higher ranking titles than they do as part of social manners (Vihakara, 2014). This may
be perplexing for Finns, but they can expect their juniors and those lower in ranking to
do the same for them, though. Kelly brought up a Hong Kongese joke, according to which,
if you are applying for a position, you need to take a chair in the hallway and wait with
other people, then, one day, you might land that position based on that you waited and
got older, not that you qualify for the position.

69

Joonas Pylvinen

Concerning the Chinese who act little on their own, they dare not act and make
independent decisions because they fear they would do something that would cause
either them or someone else at work to lose face due to working in an undesired way,
causing them or their managers to lose face (Chen et al., 2018; Vihakara, 2014). Mei
confirmed this by stating that there are lots of people who have no initiative and are
afraid of asking for instructions. She also remarked that people might begin to have
more work experience before graduating since summertime jobs and part-time jobs are
becoming more and more popular. Mei explained that in the past, working in the
summer was inconvenient since people finished their studies in July and then went back
to campus in September. She knows people who have taken up part-time jobs teaching
younger children who are at primary school.
Due to hierarchy, everything can become complicated. Sofia also spoke about a local
production supervisor who had an idea that they wanted to develop further, and Sofia
suggested that they should book a meeting with the managing director:
“[…] and then, the supervisor was like […] ‘(I) cannot (do that).’ Afterward, they wrote me a message on
WeChat: ‘Hey, I cannot (do that), but if you could book that (time), it would be really good.’ […] because
they should first ask their own boss, and if their own boss would agree, then they could book the time. But
they think that their own boss will say no, so, it is that kind of story about hierarchy…”

Sofia finally booked the time and invited the supervisor in question there, and it was
alright when “she came up with the idea on her own,” and evading the issue with
hierarchy. Thus, the problem was solved privately, as suggested by Fang (2012) and
Vihakara (2014). The extent of the problems caused by hierarchy was dependent on the
people because some employees traditionally thought that they should ask their
supervisor about every single matter not related to their responsibilities. However,
there were also more independent people, who saw no problems with asking the right
person straight away, but there were fewer of them, according to Sofia. Matias added
that there are some very intelligent employees out there, but it is impossible for them
to participate in everything due to hierarchy. He also remarked that if a manager has
very light command on their area of expertise, a lot of their subordinates dare not
participate in the decision-making processes. He recognized that this phenomenon is
prevalent in East Asia, in general:

70

Joonas Pylvinen

“[…] even though there is a lot of talk in Finland that employees are not involved (in the decision making
processes), it is good to remember (that)… people’s voice is heard quite well at Finnish companies and
there are possibilities […] and our hierarchies are small… so, there is a strength in that…”

Scores on the dimensions of power distance and participative in the Hofstede and the
GLOBE models also indicate that Finnish managers would be more open to different
suggestions and consulting their subordinates than their Chinese counterparts. However,
as stated, the problems are also present in companies of Finnish origin in China, and
even worse in completely Chinese organizations. Joel had similar experiences when he
saw that innovative people could not have their voices heard since they could not bypass
their supervisors. The supervisors tended to disregard the ideas due to a lack of time,
even though the suggestions were indeed feasible. Joel was thinking about setting up
an idea box, but a new problem appeared:
“[…] if you will do it anonymously […] the Chinese will not get credit for (coming up with that idea), even
though they exactly do want the credit and to rise up in the hierarchy…”

Since the Chinese society is very competitive with a high masculinity score, employees
attempt to become more important to their companies via their ideas but being rejected
outright will cause frustration (Hofstede et al., 2010). Kelly confirmed this, and according
to her, the threshold to approach managers is high, since suggestions are usually ignored,
and if they were heard, they might still lead to no concrete results. Joel learned from
this in China and he can nowadays more easily recognize people who have ideas that
are hard to describe at first. He has started discussing these ideas with those people,
giving them time to develop them. He has seen that over time, and when discussed with
other coworkers, these ideas may give birth to other ideas, feeding progress.
Matias also commented that Chinese employees are fairly restricted and have little
power when working. He added that there is more surveillance around, which is what
Amanda stated as well. This can be devastating for Finns who are used to lower degrees
of control and power distance (Hofstede et al., 2010). However, Finnish managers are
not expected to behave like this, unless specifically requested, but it will take time
becoming used to the local way. Matias connects the control to differences in the
company sizes, as a lot of Chinese employees have accustomed to working in very large
companies, such as traditional state-owned enterprises, which can harbor even
thousands of workers, compared to the average Finnish workplace of 50-100 people.
71

Joonas Pylvinen

Selmer (2005) has stated that the type of organization does affect cultural adaptation,
which could be worthwhile to remember in addition to the general power distance in
China.
Lastly, Joel thinks that the hierarchy does have some good sides to it. Since changes will
happen fast in a modern world, adaptations to them should be made accordingly fast,
which the Chinese can do:
“In China, someone says that we do it this way, and so they do it then… and if something will go wrong,
punishments are given and it is done again, and again, more or less as long as it will succeed […] they are
able to make decisions and push through to some direction, even if the direction was wrong, but they push
all the same.”

Even if punishing people and failing to discuss decisions first sound suboptimal from a
Finnish perspective, Joel suggested that Finns should learn from the Chinese in this
regard. If leaders fail to make fast decisions, Finnish and other Western companies will
eventually fall behind with the progress. Slow decision-making is mostly due to the low
power distance and the high femininity and indulgence in Finnish culture (Hofstede et
al., 2010). That leads to decentralized power structures and needing a consensus for
reaching decisions, while people only work shorter days and do not prioritize their
professional life and work, in general. Thus, the processes can take a while, which is
something that Chinese are unfamiliar with. Mei also reminded that the size of an
organization will affect its decision-making ability quite remarkably. The company she
works at is large, old, and traditional, but, by comparison, smaller companies can make
changes rather quickly and better adapt to changes, which Joel also admitted. Mei said,
“[…] we see an opportunity, but we are not able to wrap it […] generally speaking, a Finnish company goes
to Asia where […] high-speed companies […] they just go for many things, […](they) maybe make stupid
decisions, but they are fast… I think that is a drawback at Finnish companies. They are not fast enough, or
we are not brave enough to invest (in) something.”

Finally, Kelly added that, in Finland, matters in business life need to be discussed in
general, and potential problems need to be conversed sooner so that they and their
consequent opportunities would not be ruined because of silence. She also stated that
Chinese hierarchies are set from a young age since there is only one accepted path to a
respected life:
“[…] in society, you need to go to a university […] then to work… you will get married… you will buy a house,
from time to time you will invest in index funds and that is your life then […]”

72

Joonas Pylvinen

Even though describing a picture of life in Hong Kong, the description can be extended
to the whole of China. Being a highly masculine society and lowly indulgent, work and
professional life are prioritized, in contrast (Hofstede et al., 2010). Kelly remarked that
in Hong Kong, a person’s title and status have a large impact on first impressions,
whereas people are respected as who they are in Finland. The way people dress and
take care of their appearance also has an impact, and even if they have an English name
or not:
“[…] Hong Kongese people usually have an English name […] I had decided that I did not want to use my
English name anymore… it was just my own decision… but I was such a black sheep […] this English name
just gives people some kind of an idea that it would be like some crown […] or that (a person) is just better…
than (a person) without an English name […]”

Kelly explained that having an English name has its roots in colonial times, but people
may assume that if someone has no English or other foreign name, they cannot even
speak English in such a case. In her opinion, people easily feel superior to those lower in
the hierarchy, and that the feel-good aspects in the hierarchy were based on very
superficial factors in the end.

Public harmony

Sofia said that Chinese habits that slowed down the intensity of work included the fact
that Chinese people tend to answer with a “yes” to everything. If she gave someone
some instructions on how to do a certain task, she asked if the employee understood it,
only for Sofia to realize that the task had been failed to be fulfilled the next day. Since
Chinese people have a habit of pretending to know and understand everything when
facing the possibility of losing face, understanding their true intentions may be
challenging (Chen et al., 2018; Fang, 2012; Vihakara, 2014). Sofia found a way to bypass
this, however:
“[…] but then, I usually asked the same thing, but in a different way… for example, I could ask: ‘So, what
are you going to do next?’ Or: ‘about this?’ and then you cannot answer yes (laughs), so, they had to
explain, and I could see then if there was something that they did not get before […] I tried to dance around
the same subject with many different questions […]”

73

Joonas Pylvinen

Matias did not consider understanding the true intentions of the Chinese a huge
problem:
“[…] when you will understand that: ‘Okay, when they say that, they actually mean something completely
else…’ It is a part of an ordinary learning process that when you will observe and listen well, then you will
get it… Sure, it is the same thing with everyone in Finland as well, so, is it related to culture, that I cannot
say.”

Thus, Matias succeeded to grasp the clues in a high-context environment because of
successful adaptation. However, according to Saviaro (2007), this could have been
influenced by the fact that Finns can recognize non-verbal messages as well, in general.
Joel said that they tried to implement a more participative, Finnish way of management
at his workplace in China, related to the concealing of ideas mentioned before. They
tried to have people introduce their ideas during meetings, and it was emphasized that
trying something and failing should be embraced, since the most important point is that
they tried it together and new ideas can bloom from the old ones. Joel added that they
succeeded in this to some extent but doing that required plenty of work. However,
according to Chen et al. (2018), moving toward a more participative system, although,
still based on authority, is a current trend in China. Kelly commented on being surprised
that people from all walks of life are consulted when decisions are being made at Finnish
workplaces, and if someone has an idea that is reasonable and feasible, it can be even
put into practice.
All the Finnish interviewees also felt that speaking a common language was a real
problem to varying extents, which has a negative impact on the adaptation process and
the performance of an expatriate according to Barner-Rasmussen et al. (2014). Noora
had to resort to interpreters at times, while Sofia and Joel had worked at the same
company, and they commented that people at the office should have been good English
speakers since English was the official work language there and the management team
spoke English with each other, some being better, some worse at it. Elias said that
English is appreciated, but even relatively young people might be unable to speak it. He
remarked that when Chinese people learn English in school, they put more focus on the
written language than the spoken one. Mei commented that in Guangdong, practically
all young people can understand English to some extent and communicate in it, however.
Amanda added that being unable to speak Chinese is just a part of the problem since
74

the Latin alphabet is widely unknown in China. She remarked that business cards with
Chinese characters will open doors once shown. Joel continued with reminding that
even though something was discussed with the locals in English, understanding them
might still be problematic. People tended to articulate poorly, which could potentially
render discussions fruitless. However, this has enabled Joel to give people more time to
explain themselves and their ideas even in Finland. He added that if some bigger projects
were developed and tested in Finland, the Chinese would usually be excited and would
like to adopt that system. However, a westerner is usually needed at the Chinese office
to work as a kind of an interpreter between the subsidiary and the headquarters of the
company. Regular workers were completely unable to speak English at all, and Sofia had
to resort to using a combination of hand signs and Chinese:
“[…] it was more efficient to send emails […] if I sent the email […] understanding them may have been
quicker, but when I received an email back, it was hard to understand who did what, and why, so (I) had
to go discuss things.”

Emails were usually preferred to phone calls when the subsidiary Sofia worked in needed
to contact overseas locations, when calling would have been faster. The employees were
scared to call Britons, for instance, since they were afraid that they would fail to
understand fast speech with an unfamiliar accent. It could take a week for a Chinese
employee to receive an understandable answer to some simple questions, so Sofia felt
that there was room for optimization.
Joel also noticed that those employees who speak English, but not well, dare not say, “I
failed to understand.” People have a high threshold to come and ask if they fail to
understand something in China, and that is why they act based on how they understood
it, and in Joel’s experience, the result will often be wrong. Joel and his team tried to
overcome it by being very open and by having almost daily conversation moments. They
tried to have the employees attend an almost Finnish like “coffee break” to discuss
things. He felt that opening the atmosphere was important, and he claimed that some
Chinese want to work at Western companies just because of the more relaxed
atmosphere compared to the rigid control of companies of Chinese origin. Amanda
added that since the competition for places at universities and other schools of higher
education is so fierce, people who end up in Western companies are more well-informed
and less superstitious on average, which Mei confirmed as well.
75

Joel also commented that sometimes when a long-time manager departed from the
company, their Chinese subordinates left as well when a Chinese manager was hired as
a replacement. Joel speculates that this might change now that native Chinese
companies are gaining more and more status and prestige, making the Chinese want to
work for their own companies. As the managers in these companies increasingly come
from the younger generations whose members are more international and may have
studied abroad, the company cultures are bound to change. This would lead to
decreasing power distances and more participative decision-making processes, for
instance (Bucic et al., 2012; Kurki, 2018; Tang et al., 2017).
In addition to that, Sofia saw that certain individuals tried to avoid responsibility, or
share it with as many people as they could by involving them in it so that they could
avoid receiving all the blame if something went wrong. This is also connected to the
desire to save face, since the repercussions would be less severe in comparison as if
shared by many people.
Matias stated that the way people work and the assignments at work are considered
more important to appear good, instead of what kinds of results they really give, and he
would like to add that this is something that is changing a lot currently. Elias pointed out
that when they were hiring an English teacher, native English speakers, even those with
neither education nor experience were preferred at his company. Even people who had
received a formal education in the English language, but for whom English was a foreign
language, were immediately discarded.

Interpersonal relationships in business contexts

Matias experienced no cultural shocks in China, but he was amazed by the differences
in the ways that trade is done in China compared to Europe. In his experiences, trading
is strongly related to interpersonal relationships, and even though it is based on
relationships all around the world, in many cases both the seller and the buyer failed to
understand the properties of the articles of trade in China. However, trade was still being
done significantly every month:
76

Joonas Pylvinen

“[…] you will have to brew tea for a long time to get to talk about technology […] we do not have to explain
when we are selling a product, since a European or an American engineer will realize quite quickly, why
you should buy… and in China, the way it goes is like… that truly is never enough… you will have to tell
them in a very detailed manner… how it is… no, no, you cannot generalize, but quite often (it is like that).”

The properties of the trading articles matter little, since, as stated, the interpersonal
relationships, or guanxi, is what will seal the deals, being in the center of Chinese culture
by courtesy of Confucianism (Ma & Tsui, 2015). For a foreign manager in China, knowing
their partners and building trust first will enable everything from sales to workplace
dynamics to become smoother (Chen et al., 2018; Lee & Reade, 2018; Vihakara, 2014).
If items of dubious quality are sold to a trusted person, the trust will be broken, so it is
a given that the articles of sale should be flawless. Non-Chinese persons will yet need to
find other ways to win this trust when trading with the Chinese. For example, they could
give very detailed accounts of their products or enter thorough and long negotiation
processes, during which the partners can become familiar with each other. The ability
to speak a common language is also a great way to increase trust between the parties,
and to improve any interpersonal relationship in China (Barner-Rasmussen & Björkman,
2007).
Joel and Noora had similar notions since when dealing with subcontractors, among
others, since these are usually people who will act according to the old ways, needing
their rituals, so that the customer service will be good and items will start to move. Also,
since the competition is fierce due to an enormous population, the amount of local
companies, and the highly masculine culture, better and better suppliers are constantly
pursued and older ones are consequently replaced (Hofstede et al., 2010). Then, those
suppliers that have the most volume are preferred to anyone else, even if the
relationship with them had been excellent, as in the words of Joel:
“[…] you will almost always have to have a Chinese buddy with you, so you can converse and have (them)
as an interpreter… and to slow things down, when things proceed too fast and […] if some contracts need
to be signed […] you will have to have mastered the language with no exceptions… and lived there for
many years before you will able to do such things…”

Even having this Chinese friend in the negotiations requires a strong interpersonal
relationship or guanxi with them, since the manager should trust this person as they are
the one dictating the rhythm of the process. Amanda had similar thoughts, highlighting
the importance of having someone local with her, in a way, to open doors. Finnish

77

Joonas Pylvinen

managers should also be aware that there are many people in Chinese meetings
compared to Finnish ones. The decision-maker of these meetings is not necessarily the
person that the Finnish manager talks with and having that local person with them can
help the Finn identify the decision-maker, for instance.
According to Elias, formal agreements with the Chinese mean little, since they produce
nothing concrete. Usually, the initial agreements are worded like that, and as trust grows
and as the relationships progress, the agreements are rewritten with more concrete and
lucrative terms. Elias also thought the Chinese disregard service-orientation, being very
distant to their customers. However, if a manager or someone who is with the manager
knows them, the whole situation will change. Hofstede et al. (2010) also commented
that Chinese can be anything from indifferent to inimical toward those who do not
belong to their in-groups. That is yet another factor why guanxi should be heeded while
doing business in China. According to Joel, it can take rather a long time before a foreign
manager can truly enter the atmosphere at work until interpersonal relationships have
been established:
“[…] the Chinese will think about and take the things quite far by themselves until someone dares come to
tell you that, ‘Hey, we have been thinking about this…’ and then it will probably take a long time before
you will get into it…”

Sarkki (2017) remarked that the difficulty in entering the in-groups lies in cultural
differences and a lack of trust, which will only change with time and adaptation. Elias
also added that having tasks done in China requires connections and knowing people.
For example, his company could never have had a property in Beijing where to build the
pre-school from the ground without knowing the right people and having those people
believe in their business model since land is very expensive there. It may have had a
positive effect on their relationships that the company was Chinese in origin and
established in Beijing, the administrative city.
“[…] connections across the board (are important) in that machinery as well […] knowing people in the
Communist party is a winning lottery ticket, if there is someone who can progress things. We had
connections too […] his father was a general in Mao’s regime, and that buddy had power. And… people
reacted accordingly, there was constantly someone serving him […]”

However, Elias also remarked that the Chinese are very impatient when it comes to their
expectations, and they generally tolerate no delays, especially, when they have invested
in something. This is partly due to the high Chinese score of long-term orientation, which
78

Joonas Pylvinen

suggests thriftiness, and probably also due to competitiveness caused by masculinity
(Hofstede et al., 2010). Nevertheless, there is an apparent paradox in this behavior, since
usually being short-term oriented will lead to a desire of achieving fast results, but, then
again, Chinese are less future oriented compared to the GLOBE average (GLOBE Project,
n.d.; Hofstede et al., 2010). It would be interesting to know whether this paradox is only
related to business contexts, or if it is a more prevalent phenomenon in Chinese culture,
in general. According to Elias, if the Chinese fail to see an instant benefit in something,
they are disinterested in it:
“The Chinese are so stingy when doing business that… for those 10 euros invested, they will have to get at
least nine back […] there is always that idea at the background that… that the profit must be strong.”

However, it is unclear if this statement refers to the initial agreements or those that
could be done with a stronger relationship. Mei also commented that the Chinese
customers of her company expect them to solve problems extremely fast:
“They do not want to listen to our explanations, or the plan, they just want to know the result. They just
want to get things done. So, in Finnish culture, we wonder why the customers do not listen to us, we try to
tell them that if you choose this way, you might need to face these consequences, why do not we start
slowly, test something first. But the Chinese one is that once they think that our proposal is good, they just
demand us to finish something really fast.”

However, Mei also added that the Chinese do understand that making bigger changes
does take time, for example, the kind of changes that are related to society, which is a
bit paradoxical, unless this understanding is limited to non-business contexts. She also
remarked that she would usually be the link between the cultures, explaining to her
coworkers why they need to sometimes be faster and more responsible so that they
understand the Chinese point of view better, making her a “boundary spanner,” or a
“bridge individual” (Barner-Rasmussen et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016; Sekiguchi, 2018). In
addition, Mei received deeper information in both the Chinese and the Finnish circles
within her company that she could then share forward and increase awareness of the
others’ perspectives in that way. However, even though Mei had cultural knowledge of
both cultures, and while knowing both Cantonese and Mandarin she was unable to
fluently converse in Finnish language, which, according Barner-Rasmussen et al. (2014)
and Sekiguchi (2016) limited her role in this function.
Sofia remarked that a very traditional way of thanking someone for a favor is to invite
them for dinner:
79

Joonas Pylvinen

“… so, there may have been some colleague at work who I helped in something in some way… and then,
they invited (me)… to a dinner… and in the beginning, there were also a lot of such things that… when I
was new… so, people may have invited me, for example, like, ‘Let us go somewhere with my family during
the weekend.’ And then, they showed me places in town, for example… which I thought was really nice…
and then they invited (me) a lot… to some hobby activities […]”

These invitations and favors directly refer to the basic activities of building interpersonal
relationships in China, i.e. renqing and bao, or social obligations and receiving and
returning favors (Lee & Reade, 2018; Sarkki, 2017; Vihakara, 2014). They act as starting
points for relationships that could blossom from that point forward if tended to actively
(Chen et al., 2018). Foreign managers should note that they should give these invitations
to others as well, and it is inefficient to just wait for others to contact the managers
(Vihakara, 2014). As Sofia pointed out, using WeChat is very common in China. Foreign
managers can use it to invite people to events and relationships can be further
maintained by chatting on the platform, which will further improve adaptation as
suggested by Zaw (2018). Finally, Noora expressed that these relationships can have
long-lasting effects, as she received a thankful letter from a student four years after she
returned from China.

Informal events

Sofia thinks that people were the same, if they worked or not, but the topics of
conversations could change depending on the environment. Contrary to this, Fang
(2012) has stated that Chinese should become more easygoing outside of work, in
general. However, her company organized an annual trip for all the employees to
Vietnam, which she felt was a pleasant way of spending time together with the rest of
the employees. In a way, she felt like it was going to the confirmation school or
participating in games at the beginning of high school, which helps people to become
familiar with each other as both are common in Finland.
Matias, on the other hand, thinks that Chinese people become more open and feel more
at ease at informal events as suggested, and they will appreciate it when you share
something about you to them:

80

Joonas Pylvinen

“[…] they usually tell everyone around them everything in their lives… to coworkers and buddies (alike)…
and when a Finn tells them a bit about their own things, they become more laid-back.”

Mei commented that Chinese people are very friendly in general, but they are also more
inquisitive, asking private questions easily, which is very rare between new
acquaintances in Finnish culture. She had a hard time for a couple of days when
returning to China from Finland for the first time. This was affected by the closeness of
the Chinese social distance after she had gotten used to the Finnish social distance,
which is considerably greater, by comparison. Mei also thought that Finns act more
formally at informal events in the beginning, but they start to relax and behave more
friendly towards the end. She feels that get-togethers are important in Finland as well,
allowing people to know others working with them in different functions. By connecting
with them, it is easier to ask for help when needed.
Joel said that there were three to four occasions per year when there were some informal activities organized by the company, where people become acquainted with each
other. He jokingly stated, “Yeah, when a Chinese takes a couple of beers, they can speak
any language and there are no more walls in between…” He immediately followed this
by remarking that being at work in China always feels a bit dictated by the authorities,
but when the staff in its entirety will leave work or go on some trips organized by the
company, everyone from management to ordinary employees will behave completely
differently. This resonates with what Fang (2012) stated, as hierarchies lose their
importance to a degree during these kinds of events.
Shortly summarized, informal events can be effective occasions to build guanxi with
local managers and employees. However, these people expect that these events are
only the starting point for the relationships, instead of just connecting and avoiding
further contacts afterward, which is typical in the West (Chen et al., 2018; Fang, 2012;
Huang & Aaltio, 2014).
Going out and about in nature can be said to be an important activity for relaxation for
Finns, but Sofia and Elias remarked that doing so may be difficult in China, compared to
Finland. According to Sofia, nature is mostly absent, and to find natural environments
and to enjoy them, conscious effort will be needed. Elias also remarked that the air was
so polluted at times that spending time outside was not recommended in Beijing. While
81

Joonas Pylvinen

not crucial to business, the absence of nature and outdoors activities could have an
impact on Finns’ adaptation process.

Trust and secrecy

Matias remarked that European and American companies have exported technology
and knowledge in China for a long time. He thought that the Chinese are rather cunning,
absorbing information, but they are seldom ready to share what they think about that
information:
“[…] that is a very traditional Chinese custom, Chinese shrewdness that they play that kind of a game that
they suck the information and (they) will exploit it quite strongly, but that (information) is not really
reciprocally shared…”

Elias discussed the same matter, adding that a copying culture exists in China, and he
thought that intellectual properties are imitated without even internalizing their
benefits. He also suspects that the goal of the Finnish style pre-school was to copy the
system:
“[…] we had pedagogic meetings every week where we openly talked about everything, problems and
else… […] then (I) started paying attention, when one teacher had their phone continuously recording… all
the meetings were recorded, all the conversations were recorded… and then they were transcribed… […]
that is fine with me, but you will have to say about it… I did say (to them) that it is fine with me, whatever
you will record because I am helping you here, but you must say that openly, ‘Hey, is it okay if we record
these things?’ So… so, it is ok, but when you do it as if the cell phone were hidden somewhere […] so what
is behind that? It also kind of brings suspicions about what… the core thing in this ultimately is…”

He also noted on the poor flow of information and Sofia stated that there were people
at her company who did not convey certain information further, but it depended a lot
on the persons’ characters:
“[…] there were employees that did not… you knew that they knew (something), but for some reason, when
they were asked to share that information, then they said, ‘I do not know anything about this.’ Even though
you had conversed with them and then you just were thinking why they want to keep that information as
their own, is it because when they have that information, they can then use it… in a way, they can use it
to profit from it at some point.”

What these stories share is a lack of trust between numerous parties, and the hidden or
withheld information is kept in secret for either one’s in-groups or one’s own advantage.
Since the society is so competitive, everything that may give one the edge over other
82

Joonas Pylvinen

people is eagerly grabbed. This commonly happens even if the procedures or even the
advantage itself were unethical from a Western perspective. The concerns are valid
since even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland (2019a) had discussed them and
warned Finnish companies about intellectual property theft.
Amanda remarked that since her teammates were changing from time to time, someone
new who had something to hide in her opinion worked in the company for a short time.
She described that as a small disappointment to her. She said that people cannot be
trusted in the same way as in Finland, since people may prioritize their or their in-groups
interests ahead of that of the company. However, she also noted that the opposite:
“[…] I was there when the enormous earthquake in Sichuan occurred […] so they collected money for help
at the office and there was a huge amount of bills there, so helping their own country is important to them
[…] they did not ask, how many… tens in euros there were… so it was seen as very important… and in that
way collectivity will rise up…”

Knowing that only the in-group persons usually matter to the Chinese, what Amanda
recounted sounds paradoxical. It seems as if sharing the same nationality would be of
great importance to them, or the disaster may have extended their definition of ingroups for the time being.
Matias commented that the best way to have the Chinese to speak their heart and to
become more open is the result of a long process of building trust:
“[…] if you know a lot about something, and the other party knows a lot, then the things will start to
unravel, little by little… but the surroundings will have to be such that… speaking and conversing is like
easy to them… and surely it is, like, that… that the best conversations are very seldomly had in English over
there… in my opinion, that is a fact.”

Chen et al. (2018) have stated the same since there needs to be a strong interpersonal
relationship before trust and honesty will be achieved. Matias’ anecdote also suggests
that being fluent in a shared language would be helpful for the expatriates (BarnerRasmussen & Björkman, 2007). In addition, if the company is a foreign subsidiary
originating from Finland, for example, its managers should share pieces of information
about and from the headquarters with the locals. That will improve the experienced
levels of trust and it will generate positive feelings toward the manager and the
employer in general, even leading to enhanced employee commitment (Oh et al., 2018).

83

Joonas Pylvinen

There could well be a challenge ahead for Finns since Kelly stated,
“Finns can speak about things properly and open-mindedly in a way, which is good and can solve problems,
but if… this thing that is discussed is not something very deep, then there is a certain border after which
people cannot, cannot deal with things open-mindedly, so… I do not know if it is just deep in human nature
that no one wants changes in the end […] people want good ultimately… they are ready to listen for a bit
but to a certain extent…”

Thus, learning to open one’s mind and avoid prejudging cultural differences while
learning the Chinese language seem to be the absolute catalyst for increased cultural
adaptation. However, managers should note that regional dialects and languages are
spoken all over China. Mandarin is the native language only in Northern China while
educated people speak it nationwide, nonetheless. Elias also noted that when he tried
to pronounce something in Chinese, people were strict about his pronunciation, which
discouraged him: “It is not (essential) that you get afraid of saying something funnily,
and in China, they pay attention to that funniness...” Incidents such as these may
certainly have a negative effect on outgoing managers’ cross-cultural motivation.
Mei had noticed that when her Chinese coworkers interacted with her Finnish
colleagues, communication was slightly formal and polite, even though they had been
working together for quite some time:
“[…] so, they just do this and tell the fact […] the communication in the emails… when the Chinese
colleagues write to me, they talk more, how they truly feel, or why… […] so, this is something different how
they treat Finnish and Chinese people […] I feel my Finnish colleagues also tell me more (about) their
feelings than to their other Chinese colleagues… so… I am somehow in between this… so, I… I… hear a lot
of… their own opinions, in a way.”

The willingness to share deeper feelings is directly related to experienced trust between
individuals in China, which is yet another good reason why multinational companies
need boundary spanners to build trust between various culture groups within them
(Barner-Rasmussen et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2017).
In Noora’s experiences, the Chinese can be very good-natured, and there are people
who act altruistically. She thoroughly felt people’s humble attitude and appreciation,
and when people were thankful, they truly meant it in her experience, which made her
appreciate China and the Chinese even more. That is the other end of the spectrum that
can be reached once trust has been established. However, Noora interacted with people
in a scholarly context, raising the question if the process of building guanxi differs in
corporate contexts.

Efficiency and leisure time

Sofia thought that Finns are perhaps more efficient employees in quite many ways, even
though the atmosphere at work is more relaxed in Finland. According to the GLOBE
Project (n.d.), Chinese people are considerably more performance orientated than Finns.
However, this would mean that hard work and performing well are rewarded, while they
might not necessarily be efficient per se, and Confucianism advocates these values as
well (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Lin et al., 2018). Since the Finnish score of uncertainty
avoidance is rather high, Finns have a subconscious need for work and staying occupied,
while they score somewhat high on indulgency and femininity, which balances the desire
to work with a desire to enjoy life and to self-actualize at work (Hofstede et al., 2010).
Meanwhile, everyone had the same working hours at the company where Sofia worked
in China, so it made no sense to work more efficiently, because common transportation
away from the company back to the city still left at the same time every day. If people
were preparing to work overtime, they brought food at the factory and set themselves
in the right mood, since the first hour of overtime was not compensated. According to
Sofia, there would have been no need to work overtime to such an extent in the first
place, if the tasks at work would have been done more efficiently, said Sofia.
“[…] somebody may have decided that they would work overtime that day and then they stretched the
time they worked, which would be very illogical in Finland, in my opinion.”

Amanda also remarked that the Chinese worked long days, while she questioned their
productivity, and Elias had similar experiences, noting that the workdays are long indeed,
but the time during them is used inefficiently:
“There might be a little naptime in the middle of the day, and… we work for eight hours (in Finland) and
that time is efficient, while there the Chinese officially had an eight-hour workday, but they may have
worked for 10-12 hours without receiving any compensation. When you are at an employer’s service,
then… you are.”

Elias thinks that people should work shorter days more efficiently, which would also be
good for the Chinese economy, in his opinion. He continued,
“[…] you will get fired quite rigorously if you do not do your job or tend to it. Because the workforce is so
cheap, it is easy to take the next ones in again… and just that… if someone gets tired of that and decides
to say that, ‘Now I will leave,’ it is an insult against the employer in a way, and then they might get

85

Joonas Pylvinen

entertaining and reply, ‘We will not pay your last wages at all, then.’ So… the way they act is not really fair
all the time.”

So, flexibility and independence are at lower levels than in Finland, as the employer has
plenty of power over the employees, as suggested by the Confucian heritage and the
high score of power distance (Hofstede et al., 2010). Also, this partly explains why the
commitment levels of the employees may be low, in combination with the changes in
working environments (Lin et al., 2018).
However, Matias regards Chinese as industrious people and hard workers, while many
of them are very ambitious:
“[…] it is due to the fact that when there is an enormous mass of people and if those people want to get a
better job, you will want to differentiate (yourself) somehow… you will truly have to work a lot, and not in
a half-baked way…”

Sofia also remarked that the sheer amount of people at work is behind the fact that
tasks can be done fast:
“[…] when I rented my own place, they were just building a subway station over there… and I was like,
‘Shucks, I will probably have moved away by the time the subway will be opened.’ And they had it opened
by Christmas. So, they had constructed the whole new line in half a year […] and they had plans to construct
two more lines at that point…”

There lies a paradox within this since the Chinese way of working has been described as
inefficient, but, on the other hand, feats like that are possible. Sofia also discussed the
construction of the tram lines in Tampere, Finland, which has taken years and is still not
finished. The comparison is interesting, considering that the Finnish way of working has
been described as more efficient before. Sofia’s input on the matter was that in China,
someone with authority will ultimately arrive and say what needs to be done, and then,
unresolved tasks will suddenly proceed.
Mei commented that Finns do appreciate private time after work, even though they
work hard, but the Chinese have a different mindset:
“[…] Chinese people… because of the Confucian culture and also the customer needs, we tend to work
more hours to satisfy the customer, so we do not mind to work overtime […] in China, if they have departed
(from work), then clients call them, then they will still find the time to fix the things…”

These mindsets can be partly explained with differences in performance orientation,
masculinity and femininity, and indulgence, when Finns appreciate private leisure time
more than working, whereas Chinese favor the opposite (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Hofstede
86

Joonas Pylvinen

et al., 2010). Kelly added that Finns are consciously wanting peace after work, but in
Hong Kong, people work all the time:
“They think that ‘a break’ is such a weird concept […] because the rents are so high… there is no such
thought as: ‘From time to time, we need a break.’”

Kelly continued by discussing that people complain about work all the time, even
referring to working as suffering. She clarified that the people think they have no choice,
they will just have to work to make ends meet. Noora also recounted that people could
not afford to be absent from work, so if they became sick, they were treated with
intravenous antibiotics so that they could return to work fast, and that her students had
long days at school, as did the teaching staff. Thus, having leisure time might be
inconsiderable for Chinese people.
Lastly, both Joel and Elias discussed the fact that bureaucracy is high in both China and
Finland. In Joel’s experience, receiving a Finnish resident permit can take nine months,
and Elias waited for his Chinese work permit for 10 to 11 months. Elias said that that
caused all kinds of complications since a Chinese bank account cannot be opened
without the permit, for example. He also commented that the people at his company
were slightly inexperienced, since they were inefficient at dealing with the bureaucracy
and, then again, the authorities are very strict:
“For example, if some stamp on a paper is facing the wrong way or something else, everything must be
done again […] when the clerk sees a mistake on the first paper, they say, ‘There’s a mistake, this will not
be processed,’ and hands over the pile of papers, which is the end of discussion […] Things are not looked
as a whole and instructions are not given […]”

Elias admits that there is always a solution for any problem in the end but reaching that
will take an enormous amount of time, so the work could be more efficient. In addition
to that, when his Chinese company tried to import Finnish pieces of furniture and other
materials from Finland, the Chinese authorities disapproved of the deal, and Finnish
export documents were not accepted. In the end, they had to acquire everything locally
that they originally wanted to export.

Changing values

Matias saw a clear difference between senior employees and their juniors, and he
thought that the younger generation is somehow similar to their global peers. The
differences between generational values are due to the more international environment
of the Internet age that the younger generations were raised in, combined with the onechild policy during that time (Bucic et al., 2012; Kurki, 2018; Tang et al., 2017). In Matias’
opinion:
“They have been more influenced by our actions and we have been more influenced by their culture, so
the differences are a lot smaller, and people are really bright, following international issues and they learn
fast… I cannot say anything concrete… but there is a difference.”

Noora thought that especially young people in their twenties were very enthusiastic
about internationalization, whereas older people seemed as if they were frozen in time.
While Joel also thought that the older generation appreciates authoritarian and oldstyled ways of working, he added that when the younger people who have studied
abroad will become managers, many changes will consequently happen, which is what
Kurki (2018) has stated as well. Joel speculated that especially local companies related
to digitalization, telecommunications, et cetera, may already well be very progressive
when it comes to their work cultures.
Elias thought that only the young people who know English are different, but since he
regularly conversed with the parents and even the grandparents of the children at his
pre-school, he had the chance to see how wide the gap between the current and the
older generation is as well. He also thought that the older generations may have had
their prejudices towards westerners based on history, and how Western countries
treated China in the past.
At Sofia’s Chinese workplace, there were some employees aged 35-40 who were
progressive with their ways of thinking, for example, when it came to hierarchy. These
people knew how to profit from the hierarchy, and when it was unsuitable for them,
they could shed that part of Chinese culture. They had been influenced by Western
company cultures and they used their multicultural knowledge so that they could have
an edge in the competitive, i.e. masculine society (Hofstede et al., 2010). However, their
88

Joonas Pylvinen

age was insignificant, since the very traditional employees were also close to 40-yearsold:
“I would say that it is more related to where they have grown up… and where they have worked before.
For example, […] this HR manager who was were non-Chinese in some ways […] (they have) lived in areas
with a lot of westerners […] they have never worked for Chinese Chinese companies… Then there was
another colleague […] they had worked in some American companies… and traveled a lot… and seen the
world.”

Sofia concluded that the more traditional employees hailed from smaller places, they
were uneducated, they had traveled less, and they worked for Chinese companies at an
earlier time. Amanda had similar experiences, according to which the place and the
family where a person came from mattered more than their age:
“[…] if they had moved from the countryside to the city, so… there are still those kinds of… for example,
beliefs… a bit like superstitions… whereas those who have had something more to do with westerners, so,
those… those attributes are not apparent.”

However, Amanda recalled that someone had talked with her at work about converting
to Christianity, which was surprising to her that someone would adopt Western values
even willingly. Perhaps this was an attempt to increase one’s status as Chinese are highly
pragmatic (Hofstede et al., 2010). Consequently, they usually express no faith in any
religion.

5.3.

Differences between Finnish and Chinese styles of
management

Joel never had a Chinese supervisor, but he noted that the managers were different
persons with different styles of management. Some were more traditional and reserved,
and some were more open, but he remarked that people are like that in Western
companies as well. He thought that since his company had been in China for quite some
time already, the local managers had become familiarized with the Western working
culture. However, if someone new was added to the management team, that manager
would be really surprised at first about the ways of management at the company, When
the opinions of these new managers were inquired, it took them some time to become
used to it.
89

Joonas Pylvinen

During her time in China, Sofia had a Chinese supervisor who managed her to a minimum
extent, according to her experiences. This manager arranged for training sessions and
advised her to talk with the right people to smoothly begin her time at the company, but
that was about it. If the manager had needed some help from time to time, she came to
Sofia and asked her if she could do something or had the time to do something, but Sofia
had usually already done what was expected of her: “… she was (acting) more like a
support, if… (I) required some help…”
Based on this account, Sofia’s Chinese manager was heavily influenced by the tenets of
Daoism that promotes passive leadership in a similar way as Western laissez-faire does,
even though Daoism is not as important for Chinese culture as Confucianism is (Bai &
Morris, 2014; Lee et al., 2013; Ma & Tsui, 2015). Sofia herself stated that she was the
only such manager she encountered in China.
Sofia also recounted that her supervisor had worked at the company for practically the
whole duration of its existence and she had also acted as a temporary managing director
for the factory, and thus, she had the most seniority of all the employees, and was
respected because of that: “… so, if she said (that) something (needed to be done),
people did that.”
Respecting her seniority stems from the hierarchies, high power distance, and
Confucianism, in general (Gilardoni, 2017; Lin et al., 2018).
Sofia eventually learned that if she was unable to force the discussion of some ideas or
decisions she had by herself, she asked this manager to be present in meetings, and then,
if she said something, it was done since this manager was present. Sofia admits having
exploited this, but the manager understood why she did it, and in a way, she agreed with
Sofia and informed her that if she needed help, she would just need to invite this
manager to come along. This pertains to pragmatism and the tendency to bend rules to
fit each situation, as courtesy of high uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede et al., 2010).
There was also an older manager who refused to do anything that he was irresponsible
for, but Sofia clarified that this could be a universal phenomenon, as she had
encountered similar managers in Finland as well. It may well be yet another way of doing
the bare minimum, so that these managers can save face if difficulties are faced.
90

Joonas Pylvinen

Amanda discovered that even some employees could be like that and giving them
instructions and orders was unhelpful if they had already made up their mind about the
right way to do things. This type of defiant behavior seems highly atypical for ordinary
Chinese employees, since the managers and those who are higher in the hierarchy
should be respected in any situation (Chen et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018).
Matias remarked that his observations about Chinese leadership led him to think that
the Chinese way was more rigorous, and even militaristic compared to the Finnish one:
“… somehow the individual is not really trusted, and that way it is based on rather strong rules and orders…
the way things are done. Maybe it could be compared to… the Finnish way of management does tend to
be quite soft both at the office and on the employees…”

Mei has never had a Chinese supervisor, but her experience has been that Finnish
managers are very soft, supportive, and engaging, in her opinion:
“… they do not demand you to do anything, you need to be self-corrective to think about what you want
to do […] you need to have your own ideas and propose them, and then… they will encourage you and…
so, Finnish managers, they are more… supportive. They do not necessarily tell you what they want. Or
maybe they do not even know.”

She stated that it is very different compared to how tasks are done in China, where the
managers, based on what she knows from her time in China and what the Chinese
managers of her customers have done, might give very clear guidelines what they want
to be done. Also, if some tasks cannot be carried out to completion, Finnish managers
are more understanding and leave the fact usually unsaid. Their Chinese counterparts
are more target-oriented, in her opinion, and they do not care if the employees are
exhausted or not doing well, whereas Finnish managers appreciate their employees’
well-being and encourage them to enjoy life more, in a way.
What Matias and Mei remarked is typical for Confucian leadership and a high power
distance, but it is contradictory to the GLOBE values of humane orientation, since the
Chinese score is 5.19 and the Finnish one 4.30 (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Lin et al., 2018). This
would suggest that Chinese management would be more caring, but Matias and Mei
had the opposite experiences. Management based on Yin of Yin Yang is described as
nurturing and considerate (Lin et al., 2018), but the interviewees failed to detect such
managerial behavior patterns.

91

Joonas Pylvinen

Amanda had no clear experiences of the Chinese ways of management since she never
had a Chinese supervisor, but she commented that the local employees acted in such a
way that a more rigorous way of management was needed. Their ability of self-guidance
was poor, and they took little initiative, waiting for the manager to come to them and
tell them what to do instead, as described in the previous section. Relating to the
previously mentioned hierarchies as well, Kelly stated that in Hong Kong, people seldom
prefer to express their opinions. They know that the supervisors would just ignore them
since they are lower in the hierarchy and that the managers are unready for changes.
She said that both in Hong Kong and in China, in general, changes are faced poorly. This
resistance pertains to the high score of long-term orientation in China and slightly lower
future orientation than on average (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Hofstede et al., 2010).
Noora commented that she had total freedom when planning her syllabi, but plenty of
work was required of her, and there was a plethora of rules to follow. Expectations to
follow rules and laws is also typical for Confucian leadership, but imposing strong rules
is characteristic of Legalism as well (Lin et al., 2018; Ma & Tsui, 2015).
According to Noora, the hardest aspects related to the Chinese way of management
were related to restricting what people could speak about at their workplaces. She and
her other non-Chinese coworkers were instructed to avoid discussing certain topics at
work, and Noora connects these restrictions to the authorities protecting the people to
a certain degree, as is typical for Confucian paternalism (Lin et al., 2018):
“[…] they were protected, in a way. It has been some time, and then, they could not access information
that was in a way… given (to us). […] even more adult people could be really naïve in many things during
that time.” These restrictions may have had other motives as well, related to saving the face of the
governing bodies, for example.

While Elias was working in China, he was free to work the way he wanted, and how the
employees under him worked, but he was unable to lower the employees’ daily
workload when he tried to introduce a Finnish working hours system at his pre-school.
When he discussed it with the CEO and the human resources manager of his company,
they dismissed the idea. Making such demanding changes within an organization that
has a completely Chinese company culture could be too much to ask unless trust has
been established and the managers have been convinced. Elias also stated that the CEO

92

Joonas Pylvinen

seemed to be inexperienced as a manager, and he thought that the CEO delegated work
and wanted to be more like a developer than a manager who makes decisions:
“… maybe he told people what to do, but he never did that during meetings when decisions should have
been made. Sometimes (I) noticed that when we held a meeting where he participated as well, he did not
use his voice at all, so, we may have made a common decision, I said that, ‘Okay, let us do it this way, then’,
but, however… that decision had changed by his decision that had come up, then…”

Elias failed to recognize that the real decisions are usually done behind the backs of most
people, so that the managers avoid losing face, if concerns arise, for instance (Fang,
2012; Vihakara, 2014). However, he would have wanted the CEO to directly say what he
wanted to do during these meetings, wherein lay a clash between low-context and highcontext communicators. Finnish leaders in general score quite low on the attribute of
self-protectionism on the GLOBE leadership model, which can highlight these problems
since it can cause these Finns to not recognize the local behavioral models and their
importance. It will certainly impact their adaptation process simultaneously. Similar
problems arose when Elias was dealing with the HR manager who was described as very
strict and stubborn, usually ignoring what others were telling him. When the HR
manager and the CEO made some mistakes and tried to deny those mistakes, Elias
thought their behavior was problematic:
“It is horrible… to say that ‘Okay, now we made a mistake, let us work from that…’ They do not admit it
(making a mistake), they do not admit it, they do not… admit (laughs) it in any way, (they) make all kinds
of excuses…”

The importance of saving face in Chinese culture was unrecognized or unappreciated,
both of which can be dangerous from the perspective of building trust. However, it is
understandable since Finnish managers can easily consider this kind of behavior
dishonest. Therefore, cultural adaptation is needed. Elias received no cultural training
or education either in Finland or in China, which could have helped in this issue. By failing
to know, and by even pressuring the Chinese manager further about the matter, the
situation may even have escalated.

Chinese subcultures

Elias worked in Beijing, and after visiting other regions, he realized that Beijing is stricter
than the rest of China, possibly due to it being the administrative city. Amanda had
similar experiences, remarking that Beijing has been influenced by the bureaucratic
institutions in the city, which has made it rigid in a certain way.
Shanghai, in comparison, was more of an international city in both their experiences,
even though both cities have foreign workers. However, the attitudes of the locals were
different in both places. In Beijing, people were more curious, but, on the other hand,
awfully shy. Thus, it was harder to communicate with people, since many were very selfconscious about their skills in English, according to Elias. Amanda stated that the
Shanghainese appeared freer and more easygoing when interacting with them. This is
related to Shanghai’s status as a special economic zone or SEZ within China, which
includes mostly cities on the eastern and southern coasts. Cities belonging to the
provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu are included in these zones, while Beijing is not a
part of them. That may explain why the locals have little exposition to international
presence compared to the other areas. Special administrative regions of Hong Kong and
Macau have even more autonomy than the SEZs, and they have been open for
international trade for a longer time.
According to the Chinese Labor Law, as stated by the Ministry of Commerce (n.d.),
employees of the state “shall work for no more than eight hours a day and no more than
44 hours a week on the average.” However, different provinces have different policies,
and private employers have more leeway when it comes to setting up the working hours:
For example, and most notoriously, a so-called “996” working hour system is common
within the technology industry, meaning that some employees are expected to work
from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. for six days a week, which is facing increasing resistance (Gao,
2019; Fannin, 2019). Joel thought that China is following in the footprints of Japan and
South-Korea where companies had moved on to a five-day working week, even though
following the old model at first out of old habits.

94

Joonas Pylvinen

Elias stated that people were working six days a week in Beijing, even though the
Saturdays usually included other work-related activities than those during the week,
such as marketing events or meeting with the customers. Matias and Joel commented
that it was just like that also in Jiangsu, but Matias adds that it is not worthwhile trying
to stereotype China as one large cultural region, since the differences in working cultures
between different provinces, and even within them, can be rather significant:
“… so, I have always been thinking that China could be compared to Europe, and… if you generalize that
Finns and Spaniards work in the same manner, it would be the same situation as… they have their own
strong dialects […] and the cultural heritage is different…”

Gao and Long (2014) and Gong et al. (2011) have also suggested in their studies that the
Chinese provinces have different customs, values, languages, et cetera, which would
mean that experiences of cultural adaptation in China are asymmetrical, and that the
process of adaptation would be different for each province.
According to Matias, one of the first things the Chinese employees start to talk about
with each other when meeting for the first time is asking where they are coming from,
trying to establish interpersonal relationships in that way. Even though Matias knew
little about the differences concretely, the north and the south of China have some
notable differences. Noora could also only say that they are a bit different in some ways
and they have different customs. Amanda described Beijing and in Shanghai as safe, but
based on what she heard from her coworkers, the south could be more dangerous due
to more crime.
Mei’s input about the cultural differences between the north and the south were more
concrete, and she described northerners more straightforward and speaking whatever
they think, which could make them even rude and rough form a southerner’s
perspective. People in the south are more polite, in comparison, and softer, but, in
general, Kelly added that the Chinese way of communication can be complex and
indirect, with some things left to be read between the lines, while she described herself
to be quite straightforward in her communication, similar to the Finnish style. Mei said,
“… people in the north are more honest and straightforward, and people in the south will not necessarily
tell, what they think.”

95

Joonas Pylvinen

Based on this piece of information, Finns could relate more to the northern Chinese style
of communication, and they could better adapt in northern China in this respect, since
they can be described as honest and straightforward as well.
Mei’s home province of Guangdong is influenced by the culture of Hong Kong, which is
influenced by the culture of the United Kingdom, in turn. In her words, Guangdong is
very different compared to the other Chinese provinces:
“We are not really that… that much deeply involved in traditional Chinese culture, we are more trendy
people in a way, we speak more English, and we like Cantonese (language), we have our own culture and
songs… and also Cantonese people enjoy life more.”

Kelly said that Hong Kongese culture differs significantly from mainland Chinese culture,
since Hong Kong is a society with a different legislation and it is isolated by a physical
border. Mei had contradictory feelings towards Hong Kong, since even though
Guangdong is influenced by the area, tensions between Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland are high. However, whenever she has visited Hong Kong, she has been treated
like a local as she looks like them and speaks Cantonese.
In Mei’s experiences, Cantonese people, and mainlanders in general, are very friendly
but prefer a tighter social distance than Hong Kongese people, which is tied to the
subdimension of psychic distance. So, the Hong Kongese may think that the mainlanders
might be too close, too loud, and too excited. They might also consider themselves
better people than the mainlanders altogether. Kelly added that even though everything
cannot be generalized, the culture, the structure, and the style of governance of a
society has an impact on the cultural values as well. She recognized the existence of
political games in Hong Kong and stated that they exist in the mainland as well. She
speculated that managers in the mainland may be stricter:
“… the management… can the manager be emphatic, when they deal with the employees, I think that is
the bad side of Hong Kong, and maybe it is a bit more serious on the other side of the border… if they treat
you as a human being, or just as a machine? […] of course, Chinese women also work nowadays, but in
Hong Kong, we women are a bit ahead, let us think of the 70s to 80s, for example, when women went to
work in offices… not in just some factories…”

Nevertheless, Hong Kongese managers have a humane orientation score of 4.89 on the
GLOBE model compared to the mainland score of 5.19. It should be noted that the
Finnish score for this dimension stands at 4.30, i.e. much lower, but Finnish managers
can hardly be described as inhumane, the score of 4 indicates that this attribute simply
96

Joonas Pylvinen

has no impact, whereas a score of 5 can be said to have a slight impact. Anyway, the
scores suggest that mainland managers would be more humanely oriented than their
counterparts in Hong Kong as an interesting notion. This info contradicts the information
provided by Mei before, who thought that Finnish managers are more supportive and
understanding in general, creating a paradox.
Matias also discussed the position of women in China, which he considered good,
especially in Shanghai:
“[…] it is not written anywhere, but women have a lot of power… the leader of our Chinese and Asian
operations is a woman born in Shanghai, and I have never seen such a situation when I was in China that
a man on the opposing party would not have appreciated her, or (that they would have) looked her the
wrong way, because the ladies of the Shanghai area are made of iron […] that actually surprised me, but..
in my opinion, equality is in a good shape there, but I cannot elaborate further.”

However, Kelly remarked that in Finland, women are not sometimes taken seriously,
especially if they appear youthful and cheerful, but that the situation is still better than
in Hong Kong and the rest of China. Outgoing female managers should consider this
since it could potentially affect their adaptation processes. A question arises if the
situation is like that in all the provinces, or what the extent of this appreciation is.
Managers should be reminded that China scored low on gender equality both in practice
and in values compared to the GLOBE average, but the results were published in 2004,
and the situation may have changed since that. Hopefully, GLOBE 2020 will bring new
light on the matter.
In the end, Mei remarks that a lot of people in Hong Kong, or their parents, or
grandparents, come from other provinces in China, and they share these conflicted
feelings, being tied both to Hong Kong and their home regions. Kelly also stated that
plenty of Hong Kongese people have relocated to work in mainland China, so
representatives of different cultural regions take their values and customs with them
from province to province, making their little impact along the way. This phenomenon
is due to the highly masculine culture, in which people may leave their home regions for
opportunities, be they however far (Hofstede et al., 2010). It also indicates that the
influence of these subcultures might be weaker than it would with people staying put.
However, it is helpful to identify the meaning of the subcultures and to which degree
they are separate from each other.

6 Conclusions

Adapting to new cultural contexts and theoretical implications

When a multinational company or an MNC decides to send managers for international
assignments, it should first consider organizing cultural training for them. There are
arguments both for and against such training: On the one hand, previous literature
suggests that by learning the basics related to the other culture, such as its norms and
values, managers’ cultural adaptation processes and performance levels abroad are
improved since the training allows them to better understand that culture in general,
which is why it could be recommended (Baack et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; Jia &
Lamming, 2013; Lin & Malhotra, 2012; Weck & Ivanova, 2013).
On the other hand, other studies have shown that socializing with locals and building
interpersonal relationships with them is as beneficial as receiving cross-cultural training,
if not more (Selmer, 2005). These relationships enable the managers to engage
themselves in the culture more deeply, which would lead to more comprehensive
understanding of the culture over time (Weck & Ivanova, 2013). Social media can be
used in addition to regular face-to-face interaction to achieve this (Zaw, 2018).
Moreover, managers can avoid potential pitfalls in cross-cultural communication caused
by confirmation bias if they decide to learn little about the other culture in advance, and
thus, preconceptions that are solely based on stereotypes fail to dictate their
intercultural transactions (Baack et al., 2015). However, knowing nothing can be
dangerous as well since faux pas may be subconsciously committed by doing so. In any
case, managers should constantly compare their knowledge with what they experience
firsthand to learn more about the true essence of culture. They can improve this learning
process by turning off their culture of origin in their mind, and by trying to understand
the perspective of representatives of the other culture. They should be warned, though,
since insufficient adaptation may lead to confusion of their identities in between the
cultures, and increased stress levels.

98

Joonas Pylvinen

Finally, the prerequisite for any successful adaptation is managers’ interest in and
motivation to adapt to the other culture, since it affects the adaptation process both
directly and indirectly through the quality of the managers’ interpersonal relationships
(Oh et al., 2018).
However, the adaptation may prove to be complicated as paradoxes between theories
and reality do simultaneously exist. In the case of Finland and China, it was reported by
both Finnish and Chinese managers that Finnish managers tend to be softer, more
supportive, and more understanding than their Chinese counterparts. Yet, the GLOBE
leadership model suggests that the Chinese managers would be more humanely
oriented than Finns with a score of 5.19 compared to 4.3 (GLOBE Project, n.d.). In
addition, even though Chinese culture is described as extremely long-term oriented by
Hofstede et al. (2010), the findings show that the Chinese are very impatient and want
fast results and changes in contrast. Their future orientation is lower than on the GLOBE
average, and this relationship between the orientations and the unwillingness to create
and to follow plans should be revisited (GLOBE Project, n.d.). Lastly, even though the
Chinese are described as performance oriented, putting an emphasis on work, and they
can accomplish much in short periods of time, the findings also suggest that they would
be rather inefficient after all. This creates a puzzling conundrum that should be reexamined, in addition.

Miscomprehensions between Finnish and Chinese managers

When

China,

misunderstandings due to cultural differences are bound to happen at some point,
which is not to be feared: These are moments of new insights and epiphanies. And as
such, the managers must first acknowledge the existence of cultural differences that
cause Chinese people to act in certain ways that they initially fail to understand. The
managers should keep an open mind and avoid having prejudices, since strange and
unfriendly behavior from a Finnish perspective is rarely the result of hostility or
something that they did. Thus, acceptance is the first step of adaptation.
99

Joonas Pylvinen

Perhaps the greatest cultural difference between Finland and China is related to the
significance of interpersonal relationships. Without these relationships, the foreign
managers will be coldly treated as outsiders like other Chinese persons who are outside
of their in-groups. Through these relationships, trust can be built between numerous
parties, such as co-managers and employees, while they are an unofficial requirement
in sales as well. A smooth start will require establishing a broad network of connections.
Since Chinese managers and lower-tier employees are rarely as proficient in English as
Finnish managers, but then again, since these Finns are likewise unable to speak Sinitic
languages, it may be difficult to build new relationships. Chinese are very conscious of
their language skills and they are consequently afraid to interact with Western managers.
This will lead to the formation of Western and Chinese cliques at companies and
intermixing the two groups could be difficult. It would be an advantage for the Finnish
managers to be able to speak Mandarin to make the Chinese feel more at ease, and to
accelerate the establishment of relationships. In addition, the Finns should be patient
and give the Chinese time to explain themselves better, if they are unable to do so at
first.
Public harmony is of utmost importance to the Chinese, causing them to avoid public
conflicts and expressing themselves in indirect ways. For example, they will usually
simply refuse to decline something outright, but they expect that the other party will
read clues that indicate their intentions and if they fail to understand something, they
will still pretend that they understood it to save face. Therefore, certain sensitive
matters should never be brought up during public meetings, as by doing so, multiple
parties are at risk of losing face. Finns should pay attention to how they formulate their
own messages so that they fit in the context of high communication and they should
also learn to interpret the clues present in such communication. They can also customize
their communication for the persons with whom they have strong relationships and they
can lighten the atmosphere of communication by establishing a more participative
atmosphere at work. Lastly, if Finns want to discuss sensitive matters, such as Chinese
manages’ decisions, they should always do so in private.
The close social distance of Chinese people can surprise Finnish managers, who are not
used to private questions from complete strangers, but there is also a chance that
100

Joonas Pylvinen

Chinese will be secretive and unnecessarily formal toward the Finns. The Finns should
practice openness, sharing and asking for information in such a situation. Doing so will
inevitably lead to increased trust and improved relationships with the Chinese.
Last but not least, Finnish managers should recognize the prevalence of hierarchies in
Chinese culture and act accordingly. power distances are much greater in China and
senior managers should be treated with respect, as junior managers will do so for the
Finns as well. The Chinese meeting conventions are usually different, as many people
can be present and usually the one making the decisions is not the one speaking.
However, the decision-maker is most certainly one of these senior managers, which the
Finns need to recognize. These senior managers should not be bypassed when making
decisions since it could lead to anything between awkwardness and veiled hostility. Thus,
it is fairly common to see Chinese subordinates struggling as they need to respect their
superiors, and a Western manager should sympathize and empower them if they can do
so.
Lastly, Chinese people from managers to clients are often impatient and they disregard
detailed and careful plans and explanations when business is being conducted. That is
why Finnish managers should focus on achieving he results instead of developing
elaborate business plans.

Improved adaptation to Chinese business contexts and its long-term effects

When Finnish managers try to adapt to Chinese business contexts, their adaptation
should focus on altering their behavior according to the cultural differences, and the
process should begin with comparing the core values of both Finnish and Chinese
cultures so that the cultural gap can be closed. As stated, such differences can perhaps
most notably be found in the cultural dimensions of power distance, collectivism,
uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence. Finns should accept that the hierarchies are a
natural phenomenon for the Chinese, and they should especially try to interact and
mingle with their local co-workers as much as possible. The findings show that this is an
effective way to improve the adaptation process, and that the interpersonal
101

Joonas Pylvinen

relationships do extend and take place even outside of work, both in face-to-face
meetings and by chatting via social media. They should also rely less on rules, as it is
customary that they are bent or circumvented, as discussed in the findings. Lastly, it is
important that Finns adapt to the Chinese way of hard work by working longer days and
staying in reach of clients, and thus showing the Chinese that they are dedicated and
serious workers. This should be noted since Finns usually tend to work for the officially
stated working hours and then move off the radar until the next workday.
Depending on the level of adaptation and motivation, a foreign manager’s competencies
in working in a multicultural environment may be improved by working in China. For
example, patience and advanced listening skills may be obtained by courtesy of adapting
to the Chinese way of communicating. Based on stories of Finnish expatriates, adapting
to the new environment enabled the mangers to understand that people were similar
to them in their core, despite the superficial and most notable cultural differences.
Working in China may render foreign manager’s rhythm of life faster, since changes
happen quickly and decisions are made without long delays. Thus, it is easier to react to
surprising situations. The environment also may augment managers’ humility and
appreciation for cultural diversity, as reported. However, negative experiences can
cause foreign managers to conversely lose respect for Chinese people and their culture
while failing to see their positive sides effectively.

Adapting the style of management

Since Finnish management usually places a strong emphasis on personal freedom and
open hands due to low power distances, adaptation is needed in Chinese business
contexts where the employees are afraid of acting (Hofstede et al., 2010). According to
the findings, Finnish managers should learn to give clear instructions to their
subordinates while finding a way to ensure that these instructions are understood by
the Chinese employees. An effective way adopted by an interviewee was to ask open
questions and inquiring how the employees plan to start their assignments, what to do
then, et cetera. The employees should also be surveilled in the sense that if they finish
102

Joonas Pylvinen

what they were doing, they usually start to wait for further instructions without going
to speak with the managers themselves.
The managers should also learn to lead people in some direction when fast decisions are
required, regardless of the outcome, and take responsibility for it. They should also be
prepared to work longer days than in Finland to earn the employees’ respect, and they
should sacrifice their free time if customers come calling and need their help. The
managers need to concentrate on what results they can bring both for the clients and
their company since the way how things are done is usually of no interest to the Chinese.
Creating a participative and a transparent atmosphere at work should also be
encouraged, and it should be emphasized that mistakes are allowed there. However, if
such mistakes are made, it should never be made apparent and culprits should not be
questioned aggressively about it to preserve public harmony. Managers should also
devise ways in which employees can devise their ideas so that they could be presented,
developed, and even taken into practice without being shot down by their supervisors.
Finnish managers should also acknowledge the power of seniority in the company and
appreciate it. However, if the senior managers’ decisions seem to make little sense,
Finns should have private discussions with them to learn their reasoning and promote
rational outcomes if they have something suitable in mind.

Managerial implications

Based on the interviews of the Finnish managers, the importance of cross-cultural
training was highlighted. Adopting a stance of open-mindedness partly alleviates
deficiencies caused by lack of preparation and training for foreign assignments, but a
basic understanding of intercultural communication should be acquired before going on
international assignments. A good starting point for managers going to China would be
to adapt their ways toward the local way, instead of opting to work in the foreign way
they are used to, even if it would seem unsuitable.

103

Joonas Pylvinen

However, according to the findings, going to a foreign subsidiary in China will still ensure
a smoother adaptation process for foreign managers since the company culture is closer
to their native one and the local employees of such companies are mostly accustomed
to Western ways of working in that instance. These findings agree with theoretical
suggestions of establishing a company culture mixing both Western and East Asian
values to enhance cross-cultural communication, while cultural adaptation can improve
the communication even further (Chen et al., 2018). Thus, if foreign managers were to
go to a fully Chinese owned company, the differences would be greater and adaptation
more difficult, as observed in the case of Elias who had neither been culturally trained
for his position, nor had he had worked with intercultural themes or worked abroad
before going to China.
The findings show that knowing English is the absolute minimum requirement for
working in China, but foreign managers should remember that the English knowledge of
the locals does not necessarily match theirs. Dabbling in Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese
depending on the region is highly recommendable in terms of earning the trust and the
acceptance of the locals in a faster manner. Knowing even a little about the form of
Chinese that is locally spoken in the area where the foreign managers work can further
open doors. One should also acknowledge that the Chinese regions are dissimilar since
there are differences in customs, languages, and even values between them.

Relationships and connections

Strong relationships and a large network of connections should be built to accomplish
tasks at work efficiently. Interpersonal relationships also have the power to increase
sales and employee commitment: People are not necessarily loyal to their companies,
but they do show loyalty for those that they feel are part of their in-group, including
coworkers and managers if they have built a strong rapport between them. Participating
in get-togethers organized by the company and treating people for dinner are great
ways to nurture these relationships, which need to be constantly tended to.

104

Joonas Pylvinen

If people seem reserved, especially quiet, or if they even seem to withhold some
information, they clearly distrust the manager at that point. Transparency and openness
are the only ways to proceed in such a situation. By sharing anecdotes and personal
information from their life to them, with time, trust is built, and these persons will start
to open. All in all, it can be claimed that interpersonal relationships are the most
important aspect to focus on while in China.

Further research

This study has brought some questions to light that remain unanswered. Firstly, it would
be interesting to see how Chinese managers have adapted in Finnish business contexts
as well, and how they would need to change their behavior to compare the results with
those of this research. That would help with both Finns going to China and Chinese
coming to Finland, as a deeper understanding would be built.
Another point of interest would be to see to what extent being bilingual and
demonstrating multiple cultural values at the same time helps or hinders a manager to
adapt to a new business context. Similarly, there was a so-called boundary spanner
present in this research, and as stated by previous literature, they are beneficial to
multinational companies, but the extent of the advantage they provide remained hidden.
Their usefulness should also be a focus of interest.
Thirdly, since cultural differences between the Chinese provinces do exist, but it is
unknown to what extent, having a clearer picture about those differences would be both
fascinating and helpful for managers who need to work in multiple provinces.
Finally, the paradoxes perceived when comparing the theory and the findings should be
taken into further examination. These paradoxes include Chinese managers being
humanely oriented in theory but to a lower degree in practice, and the clash between
the Chinese long-term orientation and impatience, combined with their unwillingness
to follow plans but a desire to act immediately. Lastly, the Chinese appreciate hard work
and consequently work long days, but they are still described as inefficient.

Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning

Doftande orkidéer i Mittens rike
Kulturell anpassning av finländska direktörer till kinesiska
affärskontexter

Inledning

Ostasien och särskilt dess mest inflytelserika region Kina erbjuder en massa möjligheter
för finländska företag och därför borde man forska mer om den främmande kinesiska
kulturen. Med hjälp av nya insikter kan individuella direktörer också bättre anpassa sig
till landets särdrag och på detta sätt kan affärsverksamhet mellan företag i Finland och
Kina förbättras.
Titeln på avhandlingen hänvisar till de kinesiska namnen av både Finland och Kina.
Finland heter 芬兰/芬蘭, eller Fēnlán som ordet skrivs med det latinska alfabetet. Detta
namn används för att fonetiskt referera till Finland men utan kontext kan de två tecken
som ordet består av översättas till doftande orkidé. På samma sätt heter Kina 中国 eller
中國 som kan latiniseras till Zhōngguó, bokstavligen mellersta landet men det finns ett
översättningslån för namnet, nämligen Mittens rike.

Bakgrund

Eftersom Finland är ett litet land, behöver det syssla med utrikesaffärer för att kunna
öka sin ekonomiska tillväxt. På grund av förändringar på den ekonomiska kartan, t.ex.
Brexit och de stränga sanktionerna mot Ryssland, kan Finland inte längre bara lita på

106

Joonas Pylvinen

sina traditionella affärspartner utan finländska företag måste sikta på områdena där den
ekonomiska tillväxten är starkast och då träder Kina in i spelet.

Syftet med avhandlingen

Syftet med denna studie är att undersöka kulturella skillnader mellan nationerna Finland
och Kina och hur kulturell adaptation skulle kunna användas för att överbrygga klyftan
mellan de två kulturerna. Genom att göra så kan finlänningar som arbetar på finländska
företag i Kina bättre hantera affärsverksamhet i landet.
De följande är huvudforskningsfrågorna av denna avhandling:
•

Vad kan utvandrade direktörer göra för att anpassa sig till nya kulturella
kontexter när de åker på internationella uppdrag? Vilka typer av fördelar och
nackdelar kan sådan anpassning orsaka?

•

Hur missförstår finländska utvandrade direktörer och deras kinesiska motparter
möjligen varandra på grund av kulturella skillnader? Hur kommer de över dessa
situationer?

•

Hur kan finländska utvandrade direktörer bättre anpassa sig kulturellt till en
kinesisk kulturkontext och påverkar denna kontext potentiellt deras
tankegångar?

•

Hur kan affärsdirektörer komma över kulturella skillnader i affärskontexter med
hjälp av kulturell anpassningsprocess?

Nyckelbegrepp

Folkrepubliken Kina skall refereras till som Kina i denna text och fastlandskineser till
kineser på samma sätt. Skillnaden görs på grund av olika värderingar som etniska kineser
utanför Kina har i andra länder i Sydostasien eller i andra utländska samhällen som har
etniska kinesiska medlemmar.
107

Joonas Pylvinen

Kulturell adaptation hänvisar till begreppet som definierades av Francis (1991) som ett
försök att framlocka godkännande från medlemmar av en främmande kultur genom att
beteendemässigt försöka bli mera likadana som medlemmar av den där kulturen (enligt
Jia och Rutherford, 2010). Avhandlingen fokuserar på finländska individer som försöker
framlocka detta godkännande. De är utvandrade direktörer eller andra anställda utanför
sitt hemland. Deras ansträngningar skall revideras i en kinesisk kontext genom att
intervjua dem. Därför utnyttjar denna avhandling ett individuellt perspektiv på kultur,
kulturell anpassning och interkulturella affärsförhållanden.

Tvärkulturella aktiviteter och tillvägagångssätt

Kultur och nationell kultur

Kultur är ett mycket brett begrepp som kan hävdas innehålla t.ex. delade meningar,
beteendemässiga mönster, övertygelser, värderingar och seder som folkgrupper har
både i relaterade länder och organisationer (Chen, Chao, Xie, & Tjosvold, 2018; Leung,
Bhagat, Buchan, Erez, & Gibson, 2005). Men att påstå att de ovannämnda är allt som
kultur består av skulle vara en stor förenkling och därför jämförs resultaten av denna
studie med andra resultat som är försedda av studier och teorier om nationella kulturer,
dvs. Hofstedes kulturdimensionsteori och modellen av GLOBE Project. Möjliga skillnader
mellan modellerna och samlade primärdata identifieras och meningen med dessa
paradoxer undersöks vidare. Dessa modeller fokuserar dessutom inte på individer, och
därför måste individcentrala teorier också introduceras. På grund av detta skäl
undersöks även begreppen kulturell och psykisk distans inom ramarna för denna
avhandling för att få en fullständigare bild av kultur.

108

Dimensionellt tillvägagångssätt, dess kritik och begränsningar

Hofstedes kulturdimensionsteori

Hofstedes kulturdimensionsmodell är ett klassiskt verktyg inom internationell
kulturforskning som man använder för att försöka kategorisera kultur enligt olika
värderingar av maktdistans, maskulinitet mot femininitet, individualism mot
kollektivism, osäkerhetsundvikande, lång mot kort tidsorientering och tillfredsställelse
mot återhållsamhet (Hofstede et al., 2010). Olika nationella kulturer kategoriseras enligt
de ovannämnda kategorierna och numeriska värderingar ges åt dem så att de kan
jämföras med varandra (Hofstede et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2005).
Den största nackdelen av modellen är att den hävdats vara för begränsad och att inte
representera kultur på ett exakt sätt (Leung et al., 2005; Shi & Wang, 2011). Därtill
skapades modellen inte med individuellt perspektiv i minnet (Tung & Stahl, 2018).

GLOBE Project

GLOBE eller Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness är ett
forskningsprojekt vars mål är att bygga på Hofstedes kulturdimensionsmodell (GLOBE
Project, n.d.; Shi & Wang, 2011). Detta projekt har undersökt ledarskap och samhällelig
kultur efter att ha värderat de forskade länderna som uppdelades i olika kultursgruppar
(GLOBE Project, n.d.; Shi & Wang, 2011).
Prestationsorientering, bestämdhet, framtidsorientering och mänsklig orientering bl.a.
tillhör de nya GLOBE dimensionerna tillsammans med några samma som i Hofstedes
modell, t.ex. maktdistans (GLOBE Project, n.d.; Shi & Wang, 2011). Dessa
kulturdimensioner värderas inte bara enligt realiteten men också enligt de ideala
värderingarna i varje land (GLOBE Project, n.d.).

109

Distanstillvägagångssätt

Kulturell distans

Kulturell distans tas upp när man försöker beskriva diversiteten och dess inverkan på
mänsklig interaktion i och mellan olika nationella kulturer omkring världen (Shenkar,
2012b; Triandis, 1998). Den kan manifestera sig på många olika sätt såsom i skillnader
mellan språk, familjestrukturer, religioner och värderingar i olika kulturer (Triandis,
1998). Begreppet kulturell distans blir viktigt och relevant för de ovannämnda
modellerna eftersom de mäter dessa distanser men representationer som de här
modellerna erbjuder hävdas vara bara hägringar som försöker skapa något som inte alls
existerar (Shenkar, 2012b).
Shenkar (2012b) poängterar att det åtminstone finns tre bristfälliga antaganden: 1) att
nationella kulturer inte skulle förändras över tiden, 2) representanter från nationell
kultur A som åker till nationell kultur B skulle ha symmetriska erfarenheter med
representanter från kultur B som åker till kultur A och 3) nationella kulturer skulle inte
ha några regionala varianter. Därför kan kulturell distans fungera som mätningsbegrepp
men endast när de tre bristerna erkänns och data som utrustats av modellerna som
mäter kulturell distans blir stödda av ytterligare teorier och begrepp (Shenkar, 2012b).

Psykisk distans

Med hjälp av begreppet psykisk distans försöker man avbilda och undersöka hur
individer upplever skillnader mellan två eller flera nationella kulturer. Begreppet
används också när man försöker förklara hur man skiljer olika slags andra element från
sig själv med hjälp av olika dimensioner, såsom tidsmässig, rumslig, social och hypotetisk
distans (Baltatescu, 2014). Dessa element eller aspekter associeras sedan med andra
element med hjälp av dimensionerna och man försöker förklara hur kulturella skillnader

110

Joonas Pylvinen

erfars individuellt i motsats till kulturell distans där skillnaderna mäts med givna
variabler på en organisationsnivå (Liberman & Trope, 2014).
Genom att vidare granska kulturella skillnader och psykisk distans i fall när finländska
direktörer arbetar i Kina, kan potentiella fadäser identifieras och undvikas. Att utnyttja
den där konkurrenskraftiga fördelen som lokala företag redan har där, måste
sammanhangsberoende kulturella kunskaper först införskaffas både externt från
affärsomgivningen och internt från de lokala anställda med hjälp av samtal (Albescu,
Pugna, & Paraschiv, 2009; Holden, 2001). Där finns nyckelsärdraget för att upprätta
framgångsrik tvärkulturell affärsverksamhet och marknadsföringsstrategier som är
lämpliga för sammanhanget (Albescu et al., 2009; Holden, 2001).

Kulturell anpassning och dess hinder

Jun, Gentry och Hyun (2001) beskriver kulturell anpassning som en aktiv och kognitiv
process som kan minska stressnivåer och osäkerhet mellan representanter av olika
kulturer medan den utrustar dessa individer med sociala kompetenser när de
kommunicerar i sammanhanget av den andra kulturen. Weck och Ivanova (2013) påstår
till och med att denna process är ett grundläggande krav på ömsesidigt förtroende som
å sin sida behövs när man skapar långsiktiga affärsförhållanden. Det kan hävdas att när
två partier som har sina rötter i olika kulturer försöker kommunicera med varandra, drar
de nytta av att anstränga sig att förstå situationen ur det andra partiets perspektiv för
att kommunicera mera effektivt.
Denna process kan inte tas för given utan den borde vara en huvudprioritet för företag
och deras utvandrade anställda. Anpassning har dessutom sina utmaningar och
begränsningar. Misslyckad anpassning kan orsaka mera stress samt känslor av isolering
och ensamhet och den kan till och med förvirra ens egen identitet (Jun et al., 2001). Det
måste minnas att genom att vara motiverad att anpassa sig och att utveckla effektiva
hanteringsstrategier kan kulturrelaterad stress och de negativa effekterna undvikas (Jun
et al., 2001).

111

Joonas Pylvinen

Kulturell anpassning i fallet med Kina

Även om Kina kontinuerligt möter massiva sociala och ekonomiska förändringar, förblir
den kinesiska kulturen nyckeln till att bättre förstå landet (Gilardoni, 2017). Yrkesmän
som åker till Kina måste dessutom redan ha utmärkta tvärkulturella kunskaper och en
förmåga att samtidigt anpassa sig till denna främmande kulturell och social kontext
(Gilardoni, 2017; Selmer, 2005).
Ett av de största hindren i affärsförhållandet mellan Finland och Kina kan finnas i
skillnader mellan finländska och kinesiska stilar av kommunikation därför att den
förstnämnda är låg kontext och den sistnämnda hög kontext som båda kan verka
förvirrande för det andra partiet (Vihakara, 2014). Låg kontext-kommunikation är rak
och ärlig medan kroppsspråk och det hur man kommunicerar i stället för meddelandet
själv uppskattas mera i hög kontext-kommunikation. Allt sägs inte och det förväntas att
man läser det som inte sägs mellan raderna. Lin, Li och Roelfsema (2018) visar dessutom
att ju mer de kinesiska anställda är bekanta med och öppna för många kulturer från hela
världen, desto mer visar de engagemang för sina internationella arbetsgivare. Det måste
också kommas ihåg att Kina inte är ett kulturellt homogent land, utan olika regioner har
sina lokala kulturer som kan dock variera betydligt (Gilardoni, 2017). Genom att
framgångsrikt förstå, anpassa och integrera både västerländska och ostasiatiska
värderingar kan västerlänningar såsom finländare markant förbättra deras kunskaper i
tvärkulturell ledning och kommunikation, till och med i Kina (Chen et al., 2018).

Metodologi

Denna studie utnyttjas en kvalitativ forskningsmetod, dvs. semistrukturerade intervjuer,
för att effektivt tackla sina forskningsfrågor. Med hjälp av dessa slags intervjuer är det
möjligt att få både faktiska svar och gensvar som också avslöjar samtalspartnernas
attityder och vidare frågor kan även ställas vid behov (McNeill & Chapman, 2005; Sproull,
1995).
112

Joonas Pylvinen

Sex finländska och två kinesiska nuvarande direktörer intervjuades i februari–mars 2020
för undersökningen. De finländska direktörerna hade haft erfarenhet av att
huvudsakligen arbeta i Kina under de senaste fem åren åtminstone i ett helt år och de
kinesiska direktörerna agerar nuförtiden i Finland efter att ha studerat och bott i landet
i tio och åtta år. Intervjuerna med de kinesiska direktörerna utnyttjas för att stöda
helhetsbilden som bildas av de finländska direktörernas uttalanden.
Samtalspartnerna intervjuades mestadels via telefonsamtal och ett par av dem via
möten ansikte mot ansikte. Alla intervjuer varade mellan 35 minuter och över en timme.
Samtliga intervjuer spelades in med tillstånd för analys. Efteråt laddades varje
intervjuinspelning upp till en säker molntjänst medan de ursprungliga filerna sparades
intakta på sina inspelningsenheter, vilket gjordes för att förhindra oavsiktlig förlust av
primärdata.

transkriberades inom en vecka efter intervjuprocessen avslutats med högst två
transkriptioner per dag. En transkriberingsteknik som heter grundläggande transkription
valdes men den justerades litet. Sedan blev transkriberade data kodade med flera färger
som motsvarade forskningsteman för att lättare finna nya insikter i ämnet och samtidigt
binda data i den teoretiska bakgrunden.

Resultaten och diskussion

Tvärkulturell utbildning och regional varians

Utifrån intervjuerna med de finländska direktörerna betonades betydelsen av
tvärkulturell utbildning. Finländska företag anser inte kulturella skillnader som hinder
för affärsverksamhet utomlands, vilket påverkade de intervjuade personerna. Ingen av
dem hade haft någon kulturell utbildning specifikt för Kina med undantag av en kvinna
som studerat i landet innan hon blev anställd av ett finländskt företag i provinsen Jiangsu.
Om utvandrade direktörer inte har någon erfarenhet av att arbeta utomlands eller om
de inte har några grundläggande interkulturella kunskaper, kan anpassning visa sig vara
113

Joonas Pylvinen

oöverstiglig. I början borde dessa direktörer förändra sina sätt mot de lokala sätten i
stället för att fortsätta arbeta på det finländska sättet.
Det måste kommas ihåg att det är lättare att arbeta på ett finländskt företag i Kina än
på ett helt kinesiskt företag därför att företagskulturen är närmare den finländska och
de lokala anställda är mestadels vana vid att arbeta på ett västerländskt sätt. Om
finländska direktörer arbetade på ett helt kinesiskt företag, skulle kulturella skillnader
vara större, vilket betyder att det även skulle vara svårare att anpassa sig.
Att lära sig engelska är det lägsta möjliga kravet för att arbeta i Kina men det måste
erkännas att lokalbefolkningen kanske inte pratar språket med samma kunskaper som
de utvandrade finländarna. Med hjälp av att lära sig mandarin eller kantonesiska
beroende på region kan direktörerna bättre förtjäna förtroendet och bli accepterade av
de lokala anställda på ett snabbare sätt. Alla kinesiska regioner är sist och slutligen inte
likadana eftersom det finns skillnader mellan seder, språk och till och med värderingar,
vilket borde minnas innan man åker till landet för att utföra internationella
arbetsuppgifter.

Att anpassa ledningsstilen

Den finländska ledningen värderar personlig frihet på arbetet och därför borde denna
stil anpassas till kinesiska affärssammanhang därför att de lokala anställda är rädda för
att agera utan lov. Således borde finländska direktörer ge sina underställda klara
instruktioner för att bli säkra på att de underställda förstår instruktionerna. De anställda
borde också observeras därför att de ofta bara passivt väntar på nya instruktioner när
de blivit färdiga med sina arbetsuppgifter.
Direktörerna borde även lära sig att leda folk i någon riktning när snabba beslut krävs,
oavsett resultatet, och ta ansvar för sina beslut. De borde också bereda sig på att arbeta
längre dagar än i Finland för att förtjäna respekt, och de skall offra sin fritid om några
kunder ringer och behöver hjälp. Dessa direktörer måste också koncentrera sig på

114

Joonas Pylvinen

resultaten som de kan ge både kunderna och sina företag eftersom hur resultaten fås
vanligtvis inte är av intresse för kineserna.
Att skapa en deltagande och transparent atmosfär på arbetsplatsen borde också
prioriteras och det bör betonas att misstag är tillåtna där. Men om man gör sådana
misstag, bör direktörerna aldrig peka på de skyldiga och de anställda borde inte
ifrågasättas för aggressivt för att bevara harmonin på arbetsplatsen. Direktörerna bör
också tillåta de anställda att komma med sina idéer så att de där idéerna kan presenteras,
utvecklas och till och med tas i praktik utan att de skall bli nedskjutna av de anställdas
egna handledare.
Slutligen borde finländska direktörer även lägga märke till anciennitet och dess makt på
kinesiska företag och uppskatta sina seniora direktörer. Men om besluten av dessa
högre direktörer inte verkar vara meningsfulla, borde finländarna prata privat med dem
för att lära sig deras resonemang och främja rationella resultat.

Mellanmänskliga förhållanden och nätverk

När finländska direktörer åker till Kina, borde de bygga starka mellanmänskliga
förhållanden och ett stort nätverk av personliga förbindelser för att effektivt utföra sina
arbetsuppgifter. Med hjälp av dessa mellanmänskliga förhållanden kan de anställdas
engagemang och försäljningen också ökas. Folk är inte nödvändigtvis lojala mot sina
företag men de visar lojalitet med personer som de känner och litar på bra, inklusive
kollegor och chefer på arbetsplatsen om det finns en stark förbindelse samt förtroende
mellan dem. Att delta i sammankomster som ens eget företag organiserar och att bjuda
folk på middag är fantastiska sätt för att vårda dessa relationer som ständigt måste
skötas.
Om en person verkar vara reserverad och om hen inte pratar mycket eller om hen till
och med verkar undanhålla viss information, litar hen helt klart inte tillräckligt på sin
chef. Då är öppenhet det enda sättet som kan tas i bruk: genom att dela anekdoter och
personlig information med den anställda byggs förtroende och personen börjar öppna
115

Joonas Pylvinen

sig. Äntligen kan det hävdas att mellanmänskliga relationer är den viktigaste aspekten
som man borde fokusera på i Kina.

Vidare forskning

Denna studie har lett till några frågor som förblir obesvarade. Det skulle vara intressant
att se hur kinesiska direktörer har anpassat sig till finländska affärssammanhang och hur
de borde förändra sitt beteende för att jämföra resultaten med resultaten av denna
undersökning. Eftersom en djupare förståelse kan byggas på det här sättet, skulle det
hjälpa både finländare som åker till Kina och kineser som kommer till Finland.
Å andra sidan skulle det vara intresseväckande att studera hur tvåspråkighet och flera
kulturella värden av olika kulturer påverkar anpassningsprocessen. Det borde
undersökas vidare om dessa egenskaper hjälper eller hindrar direktörer att anpassa sig
till nya kulturella affärssammanhang.
Slutligen finns det kulturella skillnader mellan de kinesiska provinserna men man vet
inte hur stora dessa skillnader egentligen är. Därför skulle det vara både fascinerande
och användbart för direktörer som arbetar i flera provinser att ha en tydligare bild av
dessa skillnader.
