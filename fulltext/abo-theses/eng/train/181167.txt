ABSTRACT
At the moment energy companies in Finland have invested in large scale thermal energy storage to improve the
efficiency of their district heating systems. This means that energy that would otherwise have been wasted is saved
until it is needed by heating large amounts of water and storing it in old underground oil stockpiles. Direct effects
of this are the lower fuel consumption of the powerplants in the area and with that lower emissions.
These thermal energy storages will be using the benefits of thermal stratification which means that the warmer
water being charged into the storage will stay on the top of the storage and the colder water will stay on the bottom
due to the density variations of hot and cold water. The layer between the hot and cold water is called the
thermocline. This effect has been studied since the 1970s, but the influence of jet mixing and heat losses on the
thermal stratification degradation is not clear.
The objective of this thesis was to cover how these coherent phenomena could be studied. Two different
alternatives were investigated, the first one includes using the existing recently commissioned thermal energy
storage on Vaskiluoto. The second alternative is building a small-scale testbed solution in Technobothnia which
is a research and development laboratory used by the universities in the city.
In this thesis, the parameters needed for the research of the different alternatives are compiled as well as the concept
for a stratified thermal energy storage testbed. The concept covered process requirements for the testbed and
suggestions for the insulation effecting the heat flux and the diffuser effecting the jet mixing.
The results show that both alternatives have their pros and cons. From a versatility viewpoint, the testbed solution
is better but more expensive. The Vaskiluoto alternative is better since the unit already exists, but since it is in
commercial use, some confidentiality issues might arise.
Further research in this field could be the final design and development of the testbed. The Vaskiluoto case could
be further developed to serve both educational and research purposes by implementing more data collection
possibilities. Further cooperation requires an agreement with the company operating the energy storage.

ABSTRAKT
För tillfället har två energibolag i Finland investerat i storskalig energilagring av spillvärme för att förbättra
verkningsgraden på deras fjärrvärmenät. Detta innebär att värmeenergin som annars skulle ha gått till spillo
kommer att lagras tills efterfrågan höjs genom. Detta sker genom att värma upp vatten som sedan lagras i en
underjordisk reservoar som tidigare har använts för oljeförvaring. De direkta konsekvenserna av detta är att
bränsleförbrukningen minskar och med det också utsläppen.
Dessa två termiska energilager skall använda sig av fördelarna med termisk stratifiering. Termisk stratifiering
innebär att det varma vattnet som laddas in i lagret samlas överst och det kallare vattnet samlas i botten på grund
av densitets skillnaderna mellan varmt och kallt vatten. Mellanlagret mellan det kalla och det varma vattnet kallas
för termoklin. Detta fenomen har studerats sedan 1970-talet men många effekter är ännu inte klara hur effekter så
som jetblandning och värmeförluster inverkar på stratifierings förfallet.
Målet med detta arbete var att undersöka hur dessa sammanhängande fenomen inverkar på varandra. Två olika
alternativ undersöktes, det första var att använda sig av det ny uppstartade energilagret på Vasklot i Vasa. Det
andra alternativet är att bygga en testbädd enkom för ändamålet i Technobothnia som är ett forsknings och
utvecklingslaboratorium i Vasa som används av stadens universitet.
I arbetet samlas parametrarna som behövs för forskningen av stratifierings förfallet i båda alternativen, också ett
koncept för testbädden som består av ett småskaligt termiskt energilager. Konceptet innehåller kraven för
processens utrustning samt förslag på dimensioneringen av isoleringen samt diffusorns utformning.
Resultatet av arbetet visar att båda alternativen har för och nackdelar. Alternativet bestående av testbädden vid
Technobothnia är mera mångsidigt men kräver också mera investeringar. Alternativet bestående av samlande av
data från energilagret på Vasklot kräver inga större investeringar men eftersom lagret är i kommersiell användning
så kan det vara frågan om sekretessbelagd information som behöver samlas.
Vidare forskning inom detta ämne kan vara den slutliga designen och utvecklingen av testbädden. Alternativet
med energilagret på Vasklot kan vidareutvecklas genom att ta kontakt med företaget och diskutera hur mycket
data kan göras tillgängligt för forskningsändamål, också analysen av data kan påbörjas.

INTRODUCTION

The heating and cooling of built environments are responsible for roughly 40% of the total
energy consumption in the EU. Heating of residential buildings stand for the majority, after that
come industrial buildings and lastly commercial buildings (Kavvadias, Navarro & Thomassen.
2019). The heating and cooling of built environments are notorious for low efficiencies. Large
amounts of thermal energy go to waste and the heat production is mostly based on fossil fuels.
To integrate future energy technologies into the heating and cooling sector, the possibility of
energy storage is a must and with the creation of such, the heating sector could be a forerunner
in the decarbonization of the energy sector. If current and future steam-based power plants will
operate in CHP mode together with thermal storage and district heating systems, the overall
efficiency of the energy system would increase significantly.
Currently there are two large-scale cavern thermal energy storages projects in Finland one in
Mustikkamaa, Helsinki which is rated at 11.6 GWh, a charge and discharge rate of 120 MW
and a volume of 260,000 cubic meters (HELEN 2018), and one in Vaskiluoto, Vaasa which is
rated at 7 to 9 GWh, a charge and discharge rate of 100 MW, and a volume of 210,000 cubic
meters (VV 2019). Both the cavern thermal energy storage in Helsinki and the one in Vaasa
have been converted from old oil storage caverns. This shows that there is a big interest in
starting to store thermal energy used for district heating from the summer season when the
demand is low until the winter when the demand rises.
In this thesis, two alternatives presented for researching the physical parameters effecting the
stratification such as the heat losses in the form of heat transfer to the surroundings and the jet
mixing. The first alternative that has been investigated is the use of the Vaskiluoto thermal
energy storage as a living laboratory. The second alternative is to make a small-scale thermal
energy storage that would simulate the phenomena occurring in a large-scale one in the research

2.1

THEORY
Thermal energy storage in general

The heating of living spaces accounts for approximately a fourth of the Finnish energy
consumption (RTS 2019). One way to decrease the energy production for heating of buildings
is to store excess or waste heat more effectively. Seasonal storage of thermal energy supports
circular economy concepts in many ways: it makes waste heat recovery more desirable and
effective, and also increases the usability of renewable energy by solving the problem of time
difference problem between supply and demand. Thermal storage will also strongly impact the
economy of heating because the storage can be charged while the market value is low and can
be discharged when the price is high.
In the future, intelligent and open-district heating and cooling, or the so-called 5th generation
of district heating, is very dependent on thermal energy storage to balance the demands on
heating and cooling and allows for flexibility in demand.
The size of a thermal storage can vary from a small building specific storage unit up to a very
large region-specific storage unit. The scalability of the system gives a positive advantage in
the fact that the ratio between the volume and the surface of a storage unit can be maximized.
Stored thermal energy has been used even before recorded history (Lee 2013). For example,
people used to live in natural or manmade cave dwellings in rock or soil, where the temperature
was warm in the winter and cold in the summer, since air temperature will not penetrate deep
into the ground. The dwellings of the native people in New Mexico and Arizona in the USA
functioned similarly on an hourly basis, meaning that the heat from the day did not penetrate
the walls before the middle of the night, and the cold of the night cooled the walls during the
day. Ice cellars, where ice from the winter was stored throughout the year have also been a
worldwide solution for different cooling needs. A later thermal energy storage solution is the
single-family house water heater, where water is heated during several hours and used only
during short periods. The interest in large scale thermal energy storage began during the oil
crisis in the early 1970s.
Thermal energy storage can be divided into two different solutions, the first one being sensible

2

heat storage. When energy is stored by increasing or decreasing the temperature of a medium,
sensible heat storage is occurring. The storage medium can be liquid, solid or gas, but it stays
the same through the charging and discharging cycle. Each medium has its own properties and
with that its own advantages and disadvantages. Usually, the media is chosen depending on its
heat capacity, density, and availability. The equation for energy stored in a sensible heat storage
is as follows:
𝑄 = 𝑚 ∗ 𝑐𝑝 ∗ ∆𝑇

(1)

where Q is the amount of energy, m is the mass, cp is the specific thermal capacity of the media
used and ΔT is the temperature difference before and after heating or cooling.
The other option is phase change material (PCM) energy storage where the latent heat of fusion
of a media is used. The material used in this kind of thermal energy storage needs two
characteristics to be optimal: a suitable phase-change temperature and a large melting enthalpy:
this means that much energy is stored in the latent heat of fusion. These systems are usually
used so that the material alters between solid and liquid but also the phase change between
liquid and gas can be used. In the latter case, the enthalpy of vaporization is of importance. The
materials used in a latent heat energy storage can be organic or inorganic. Some organic
materials used are paraffins and non-paraffins such as fatty acids and regular water in case the
thermal storage is used in a low-temperature system. Inorganic materials can be metallic alloys,
saline composites, and salt hydrates. Equation 2 (Cabeza 2014) expresses the latent thermal
energy content of a media.
𝑄𝐿 = 𝑚 ∗ ℎ𝑓𝑔

(2)

The latent heat 𝑄𝐿 is defined as the mass m in kilogram times the latent heat of fusion ℎ𝑓𝑔 in
kilojoules per kilogram. This is added to the sensible heat to get the total content of thermal
energy within the media. In figure 1 is a comparison in energy content per kilogram between
water and an PCM paraffin; note that the paraffin changes from solid to liquid between 5070°C.

Thermal energy storage systems are compared with the help of a series of factors. The factors
most commonly used are listed in table 1.
Table 1 Thermal energy storage specification comparison (IRENA 2013)

Parameter

Explanation

Capacity

How much energy can be stored in the system? This depends on
the amount of storage media, temperatures and type of thermal
energy storage.

Power

This defines at what power the energy can be discharged out of
the thermal storage, as well as at what power it can be charged.

Efficiency

How much of the charged energy can be discharged? This covers
the losses during charging and discharging as well as losses during
the storage period.

Storage Period

For how long can the energy be stored? This can be hours, days,
weeks, or months for seasonal storage applications.

Charge/Discharge Time

How long does it take to charge and discharge the system? This
depends on the capacity and power of the storage

Cost

What will the monetary cost of the system be, both in capital

4

expenditure and operational expenditure?

As far as large scale sensible seasonal energy storage is concerned, the unit in itself can either
be situated above ground such as a pool or tank filled with the storage material or it can be
situated underground.

2.1.1 Cogeneration combined with energy storage
According to Cabeza (2014), an issue with the CHP powerplant is that there is usually a
mismatch between electrical and heating demand, meaning that one of them must be prioritized,
and this will mean that the overall efficiency of the powerplant will decrease. However, if there
is a possibility to store the thermal energy, this means that the powerplant can be run more
efficiently and for a longer time since the thermal energy will be stored until it is needed. For
this, several CHP-TES interaction methods can be used. Some of the CHP-TES interaction
methods are listed in table 2.
Table 2 CHP-TES interaction methods (Cabeza 2014)

Heat load:

Interaction method:

No heat load

CHP runs and charges the TES.

Low heat load

CHP running, surplus heat is charged to TES

Low heat load

CHP not running, TES discharging to system

High heat load

CHP running, full load delivered to system

Heat load higher than CHP capacity CHP running, TES discharging to system

Electricity spot markets show that there is a significant difference in price between peak and
off-peak hours. This means that with a TES, the thermal load does not have to be considered
and hence the powerplant can be run when it is most profitable and the thermal energy can be
stored until it is needed. Due to current regulations, in some European countries the best
production strategy is to meet thermal demand and sell the electricity to the power grid. This
presents an issue because the incoming electrical energy volume must be reported to the electric
market operator and it can be hard to foresee. In case the produced volume does not correspond
to the reported volume, there will be penalties.

Figure 2 Process diagrams showing different layout possibilities of heat source thermal energy storage and district heating
system (IEA ECES 2018)

Studies by Nuytten et al, (2012) have shown that the combination of TES and CHP can improve
the CO2 reduction by a factor of three. This is due to longer continuous operation time of the
CHP unit and by eliminating unnecessary start-ups and shutdowns. In this case by storing the
thermal energy, the plant can increase the profitability up to 15%, by producing electricity when
the price is high.

2.1.2 Underground energy storage
For large scale sensible energy storage, it is possible to have it above ground such as a large
tank, but in that case weather conditions effect it significantly especially in winter when the
stored heat is needed (RTS 2019). One alternative to this is to store the thermal energy
underground in an underground thermal energy storage or UTES for short. Underground energy
storage is also in itself divided into four subcategories which are as follows: Firstly, ATES, or
aquifer thermal energy storage, where thermal energy is stored in an aquifer, which is an
underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, gravel, sand or silt. Secondly, BTES or
Borehole thermal energy storage, where pipes are run down and up through boreholes in the
ground and transfer energy into the surrounding material where it is then stored. Next, CTES,
or Cavern thermal energy storage, where an underground cavern is filled with the storage fluid.
And finally, DTES, or duct thermal energy storage, where vertical or horizontal ducts are
inserted to the ground and the heating media is run through them, and by doing so the thermal

6

energy is stored in the ground. The difference between these underground thermal energy
storages is also shown in figure 3.

Figure 3 The different types of underground energy storage (Lee 2013)

Underground thermal energy storages can be added to almost all types of heating or cooling
systems. The geological and hydrological conditions at the site is the largest determining factor
of which type of UTES would be the most suitable. If there is an aquifer available close by, an
ATES could be made, if not a BTES could be made, and if there is a cavern in the bedrock, or
enough capital to make one a CTES could be a good solution.
2.2

Heat losses from a CTES

The heat losses within an CTES are mainly through conduction through the ground and internal
heat losses within the thermal stratification (Lee 2013). The ground in itself can be regarded as
a natural thermal energy storage, due to the fact that below a certain depth the temperature is
not affected by the air temperature and is instead close to the annual mean temperature. The
ambient temperature of the storage is opposite of the energy demand, that means that it is colder
than the air in the summertime and warmer than the air in the wintertime.

2.2.1 Conduction
According to Alvarez (2003) heat transfer through conduction happens in materials in all
phases. The temperature of a material means that the particles in the material moves around and

7

have an amount of kinetic energy proportional to the temperature. The kinetic energy will
transfer from the particles with the most energy to the ones with the least. An example of this
is that if the end of a rod is heated, the particles in the heated end will have more thermal energy
but the thermal energy will soon also reach the other end of the rod. The rate of this heat transfer
will be dependent not only on the amount of amount of heat conducted in the rod and the
dimensional factors, but also on the thermal conductivity coefficient of the material. If there is
conductive heat transfer through a plane surface of a homogeneous material perpendicularly to
the surface as in figure 4, then equation 3 defines the heat flow.

Figure 4 Thermal conduction through a plane homogenous object (Forsberg 2020)

𝑄 =𝐴∗𝑘∗

𝑇1 − 𝑇2 𝑘

(3)

where Q is the heat flow in watts, A is the area in square meters, k is the thermal conductivity
in watts per meters times Kelvin, the temperatures are in Celsius, the x values and L are in
meters. In case there are several layers of different materials, with different thermal
conductivities and length in the x-axis this will change the formula. If the area of the surface
does not change perpendicularly to the heat flow, the heat flow can be calculated according to
equation 4.

𝑄̇ = 𝐴 ∗ 𝑥

where 𝑥1 and 𝑘1 is length and the thermal conductivity of the first layer, 𝑥2 and 𝑘2 is length
and the thermal conductivity of the second layer and so on. The temperatures and heat flow
through each layer can be calculated with equation 3. Figure 5 shows an example of the heat
conduction through a multi-layered surface.

Figure 5 heat conduction through layers of different length and thermal conductivity (Toledo, Singh, & Kong 2018)

2.2.1.1 Thermal Diffusivity
When calculating heat conduction through a material, an important factor is the heat diffusivity
often using the symbol α (Çengel 2003). This represents how fast heat diffuses through a
material and is defined in is equation 5.

𝛼=

𝑘
𝜌 ∗ 𝐶𝑝

(5)

where k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and Cp is the thermal capacity. The thermal
diffusivity is essentially the conductivity of the material divided by the thermal energy stored
in the material.

9

2.2.1.2 Transient heat conduction in semi-infinite solids
Since, the conduction heat loss from the sides and floor of an underground thermal energy
storage will penetrate the earth. The calculations used should be based on transient heat
conduction through a semi-infinite solid, because the earth can be considered semi-infinite in
this case (Çengel 2003). This is defined by differential equation 6.
𝜕 2 𝑇 1 𝜕𝑇
=
𝜕𝑥 2 𝛼 𝜕𝑡

(6)

The initial condition is that that at t=0, the whole slab that is considered semi-infinite is at an
initial temperature 𝑇𝑖 .
(7)

𝑇(𝑥, 0) = 𝑇𝑖
The boundary conditions can be defined as follows. The surface temperature is always 𝑇𝑠 .
𝑇(0, 𝑡) = 𝑇𝑠

(8)

And the temperature at some distance into the slab is always 𝑇𝑖 at some point in time.
𝑇(𝑥 → ∞, 𝑡) = 𝑇𝑖

(9)

The variables in the differential equation cannot be separated in this case since the object is
infinite so another approach is needed. The partial differential equation can be converted into
an ordinary differential equation by combining the variables into a similarity variable that we
could define as 𝜂.

𝜂=

𝑥
√4𝛼𝑡

(10)

x is the distance into the slab from the surface, α is the thermal diffusivity and t is the time. This
similarity variable fulfils all the earlier stated conditions, and when put into the earlier partial

10

differential equation the result is equation 11.
𝑑2𝑇
𝑑𝑇
=
−2𝜂
𝑑𝜂2
𝑑𝜂

(11)

If this is solved analytically with the given boundary conditions, we get the following equation:
𝑇 − 𝑇𝑠
= 𝑒𝑟𝑓(𝜂)
𝑇𝑖 − 𝑇𝑠

(12)

Where 𝑒𝑟𝑓(𝜂) is the gaussian error equation, which is expressed in the following way:

𝑒𝑟𝑓(𝜂) =

2
√𝜋

𝜂

∫ 𝑒 −𝑢 𝑑𝑢

(13)

The final equation expressing the heat conduction through a semi-infinite solid will look like
this:
𝑥
)
𝑇(𝑥, 𝑡) = 𝑇𝑠 + (𝑇𝑖 − 𝑇𝑠 ) ∗ 𝑒𝑟𝑓 (
√4𝛼𝑡

(14)

The function for the surface heat flux can be solved from Fourier’s law, giving the following
equation:

𝑞𝑠′′ = −𝑘

𝜕𝑇
𝜕𝑥

(15)

With x being 0 since it is at the surface, this formula can be solved analytically for a more
specified function that will look like equation 16.

𝑞𝑠′′ (𝑡) = 𝑘

(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑖 )
√𝜋𝛼𝑡

(16)

Note that equation 16 is the solves the heat flux per unit of area (W/m2).

2.2.2 Convection
Heat transfer trough convection means that if a solid material with a higher temperature is in
contact with a liquid or a gas with a lower temperature, at least some amount of heat will transfer
from the solid material to the matter with lower temperature (Alvarez 2003). This means that
the layer of gas or liquid closest to the solid material will attain some of the thermal energy,
which will cause the density of the gas or liquid to decrease and this will result in the media
moving upwards. The fluid motion upwards will in turn cause colder liquid or gas to come in
contact with the solid material and the cycle continues. This phenomenon is called natural
convection or free convection. One example of this is if a water filled pot is placed on a stove,
the water particles nearest to the middle of the bottom will be heated first and rise to the top
and colder water particles will take its place, this cycle continues until the heat is turned off or
the water has evaporated. This effect works in the opposite way in case the surface is colder
than the fluid or gas. An example of when the surface is colder is when hot air reaches a cold
window, the density will increase, and the air particles will fall towards the floor.
2.2.2.1 Types of Convection
Convection can be divided into two types: forced convection and natural convection. Forced
convection means that an external force such as a pump or a fan is pushing a colder media to
contact the hotter surface for a cooling effect of the surface or vice versa for heating (Çengel
2003). Natural convection is caused by the temperature difference, the buoyancy effect results
in convection over a surface. Convection can also be divided in external or internal. External
convection means that the fluid is forced over an external surface and internal means that the
fluid is forced through a channel, where the surrounding surfaces are heated or cooled by the
fluid.
2.2.2.2 Physical mechanisms of convection
The heat transfer through convection largely depends on the physical properties of the fluid that
is in motion (Çengel 2003). The properties that need to be considered is thermal conductivity
k, density ρ, specific heat Cp, dynamic viscosity μ. Even though convection is a very complex
type of heat transfer, it is proportional to the temperature difference between the fluid and the

12

surface and can be expressed by equation 17, which is Newtons law of cooling.
𝑞̇ = ℎ(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞ )

(17)

Where q̇ is the heat flux in watts per square meter, h is the convection heat transfer coefficient
in watts per square meter times Kelvin. TS is the Temperature of the surface and T∞ is the
temperature of the fluid, both temperatures are in K. To calculate the flow of energy, the surface
area is needed as well, the equation for this is the following:
𝑄̇ = ℎ𝐴𝑠 (𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞ )

(18)

Here Q̇ is the specific flow of energy in watts and the AS is the area of the surface that the fluid
is in contact with in square meters. Even though these formulas are seemingly very simple, the
factors behind the heat transfer coefficient are much more complex.
When a fluid passes over a solid non-porous surface, the layer of fluid that is closest to the
surface comes to a complete stop, in other words, the fluid does not have any velocity relative
to the surface (Çengel 2003). This is called a no-slip condition due to there not being any
slippage between the fluid and the surface, this is prevalent in all fluids besides some rare gases.
The no-slip condition influences the velocity profile extensively in a fluid flow, the closest layer
is standing still, which slows down the next layer due to friction, which in turn slows down the
following layer and so on.

Figure 6 Velocity and temperature profile during forced convection along a surface with a higher temperature (White 2008)

13

When two bodies at different temperatures are in contact, the temperature will eventually even
out. The heat conduction between the surface and the fluid means that the layer closest to the
wall will eventually reach the same temperature as the surface, this is called the no-temperaturejump condition. This means that the layer closest to the wall will have the same rate of heat
transfer as a pure conductive heat transfer so the formula for the equation for the layer closest
to the wall can be expressed as this.

Where T is the temperature of the fluid layer and ∂T/∂y is the thermal gradient at the surface.
This heat is then transferred by convection, due to the fluid motion, there will be a thermal
gradient starting at the surface temperature and ending in the initial fluid temperature. With this
formula combined with Newtons law of cooling, we can get the formula for determining the
convection heat transfer coefficient.

where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, Ts is the temperature of the surface, T∞ is
the temperature of the fluid.
With forced convection, there is a much higher heat transfer rate than natural convection in part
because of the much higher velocities, in natural convection fluid velocities rarely exceeds 1
meter per second, since this force is only driven by gravity. This force is called the buoyancy
force and it affects an object according to the following equation:
𝐹𝑏𝑢𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝜌𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

(21)

where Fbouyancy is the buoyancy force in Newtons, g is the gravitational acceleration meters per
second squared, ρfluid is the density of the fluid in kilogram per cubic meter and Vobject is the
volume of the object submerged in the fluid in cubic meters. This is the total buoyancy force of
an object semi or completely submerged in a fluid. The formula for the net force of an object
semi or completely submerged needs to consider the gravitational force on the object as well as

14

in the following equations:
𝐹𝑛𝑒𝑡 = 𝜌𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 − 𝜌𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

(22)

𝐹𝑛𝑒𝑡 = (𝜌𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 − 𝜌𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 ) ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

(23)

As can be seen, the force is proportional to the difference in density between the object and the
fluid. This means that the buoyancy force nullifies as much of its weight as the fluid it displaces.
This is also known as Archimedes principle. The buoyancy effect is needed for convection heat
transfer, since it is the driving force of the fluid movement. The difference between the hot and
the cold fluid lies in its density since a hotter fluid will expand and thus have a lower density.
The expansion rate due to temperature change of a fluid at a constant pressure is defined as the
volume expansion coefficient β. The volume expansion coefficient is defined in equation 24.

𝛽=

(24)

Where v is the volume, T is the temperature and P is the pressure. Density is often used in the
place of volume in natural convection calculations and that would make the equation look like
this:

𝛽≈−

1 𝜌∞ − 𝜌

𝜌 ∆𝑇
𝜌 𝑇∞ − 𝑇

(25)

This is the formula for the volume expansion coefficient at a constant pressure. The subscript
∞ in this case means the density and temperature of the fluid at a sufficient distance from the
surface that it is not affected by the surface temperature.

2.2.2.3 Dimensionless parameters for natural convection.
The Prandtl number is a dimensionless parameter that describes the thickness of the thermal
boundary layer and the velocity boundary layer. It is defined in equation 26. It can be considered
as the ratio between the molecular diffusivity of momentum and the molecular diffusivity of
heat.

μ is the dynamic viscosity in Pascal seconds, Cp is the specific heat capacity in kilojoules per
kilogram kelvin, k is the thermal conductivity in watts per meters Kelvin. The Grashof number
is used to determine the flow regime in natural convection applications. Much like the Reynolds
number in a pipe system. The Grashof number is defined in equation 27.

Where g is the gravitational acceleration in meters per second squared, β is the volume
expansion coefficient in one divided by Kelvin, Ts being the temperature of the surface in

16

degrees Celsius, T∞ being the temperature of the fluid in degrees Celsius, Lc which is the
characteristic length of the surface, and lastly ν which is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in
square meters per second. Note that equation 27 is true in case the fluid is warmer than the wall,
if the wall is warmer the temperatures of the wall and fluid should be reversed so that the
temperature difference always is positive. The critical Grashof number for natural convection
along a vertical plate is 109 which means that the flow is laminar below 109 and turbulent above
it.
The Raleigh number is the product of the Grashof and Prandtl number and can be explained as
the ratio between the timescales for thermal transport via diffusion and the timescale for thermal
transport due to fluid velocity. The Rayleigh number is defined in equation 28.

𝑅𝑎𝐿 = 𝐺𝑟𝐿 ∗ 𝑃𝑟 =

The Nusselt number which is the dimensionless heat transfer coefficient and is solved from the
Raleigh and Prandtl number, the equations depend on the geometry of the surface. In equation

The Nusselt number for a horizontal plate is dependent on if the surface is hotter or colder than
the fluid. The formula for a horizontal plate with the upper surface being in contact with the
fluid and with the surface being hotter than the fluid is the same as the formula for a vertical
plate with the lower surface being in contact with the fluid and the surface being colder. This
situation is also dependent on the which range the Raleigh number is in. If the Raleigh number
is between 104 and 107 equation 30 is applicable. And if the Raleigh number is between 107 and
1011 equation 31 is applicable.

In the opposite case of the earlier formulas is the case if the upper surface of a plate is cold and

To solve the natural convection heat transfer, the length of the surface is also needed, for a
vertical surface this is very straight forward since it is the length of the vertical surface that the
fluid flows alongside. In circumstances other than a vertical surface, the formula for the
characteristic length is defined in equation 33.

𝐿𝑐 =

Where 𝑘 is the thermal conductivity of the fluid at the film temperature 𝐿𝑐 is the characteristic

2.2.2.4 Convection as a boundary condition to Transient heat conduction in semi-infinite
solids
One of the most prevalent boundary conditions for transient heat conduction through a semiinfinite solid is heat transfer from a fluid to the surface through convection (Çengel 2003). This
occurs in all situations where an object of one temperature is in an environment of a fluid of
another temperature. The boundary condition between the solid and the fluid, also called the
surface energy balance is described in the following manner: Heat conduction at the surface in
certain direction is equal to the heat convection at the surface in the same direction. Equation
35 expresses one-dimensional heat transfer from a fluid onto a surface.

Thermal radiation

Energy in different forms such as heat can travel from one physical body to another through
electromagnetic waves (Alvarez 2003). The wavelength of the most important part of thermal
radiation in this subject is between 0.1 and 1,000 micrometres even though radiation of another
wavelength can have a heat effect. Heat radiation as any other electromagnetic radiation travels
in the speed of light and can travel through a vacuum. All physical bodies with a temperature
above absolute zero emit heat radiation. When thermal radiation reaches a physical body be it
in solid, liquid or gas one part of the radiation will be absorbed another will be reflected, and a
part of the radiation can go through the body this is also called transmission.
If a matte black physical body absorbs all light that lands on it, no energy will be transferred

19

away from the body due to reflection or transmission, this is called a black body. Black-body
radiation is often used in thermal radiation calculations for example when a material’s radiation
properties are studied. The amount of energy transferred by thermal radiation per square meter
of area is calculated in the following manner:
ℎ = 𝜀 ∗ 𝜎 ∗ (𝑇𝑠2 + 𝑇22 ) ∗ (𝑇𝑠 + 𝑇2 )

(37)

h is the thermal radiation coefficient in Watts per square meter and Kelvin. ɛ is the emissivity,
𝑇𝑠 is the temperature of the surface and 𝑇2 is the temperature of the surrounding surfaces. 𝜎 is
Stefan-Boltzmann constant which is the radiation constant of a black body The StefanBoltzmann constant is the following:

𝜎 = 5,67

Thermal properties of water and air

There a many different properties of fluids that need to be considered when doing heat transfer
calculations, many of these properties are temperature dependent as well which makes things a
bit more complex. For starters, the density of fluids and gases will decrease due to thermal
expansion. Some examples of this can be seen in table 4.

ρ is the density, the density is not linear as can be seen from table4, this is due to the volume
expansion coefficient β increasing with temperature. the absolute pressure must also be
considered, but this has a larger effect on gases. The density of air can be calculated with the
following formula.

𝜌𝑎𝑖𝑟 =

ρair is the density of the air in kilograms per square meter, P is the absolute pressure in Pascal,

Thermal properties and temperature of the bedrock

Since CTES are often situated in the bedrock, the thermal properties of said rock is of upmost
importance. Since this thesis will be focused on the Vaasa region in Finland the most common
types of bedrock are mica-gneiss and veined gneiss (Sipilä et al 2017). The main properties that
are of interest in this case is the thermal conductivity, density, and specific thermal capacity.
All these parameters are needed to calculate the thermal diffusivity needed for the heat
conduction calculations. The following parameters were found for rock samples from
Olkiluoto, Finland but are of the same rock type commonly found in Vaasa, Finland.

The temperature of the ground is an equilibrium between the air temperature and temperature
conducted from the lower levels of the Earth’s crust. The temperature of the top layer of soil is
significantly dependent on the diurnal temperatures and the weather, however these temperature
variations do not reach very deep, as can be seen in figure 8.

23

Figure 8 Temperature variations depending on above ground conditions (Rantala 2005)

Diurnal temperature cycles usually do not reach deeper than 0.5 meters, and weather variations
usually do not reach deeper than 1 meter (Rantala 2005). The annual weather variations do not
affect anything deeper than 6 meters. Deeper than this the thermal gradient of the earth’s crust
is used and that is about 8-15 K/km in Finland which is considered to be a low Enthalpy area
(Kallio 2019).
2.6

Thermal Stratification

When hot or cold water is injected into a storage tank at a different temperature and if no mixing
occurs the warmer water will rise to the top and the colder will gather at the bottom due to
differences in density (Njoku, Ekechuwu & Onyegegbu 2014). Between the two layers a
transition zone will occur, this is also called the thermocline. The importance of stratification
in Thermal storages has been researched extensively since the 1970s and it has been proven that
stratified thermal storages have a superior performance compared to fully mixed thermal
storages. For example, when connected to a solar collector, if cold water from the bottom of the
tank is lead to the collector, the larger temperature difference will cause more heat to be
collected into the fluid. Also, if the fluid is extracted at the top it will have a higher temperature

24

and more usable energy than if the fluid was at the average storage temperature.
The stratification of the storage unit will persist as long as hot fluid is inserted at the top and
cold fluid is extracted from the bottom (Njoku, Ekechuwu & Onyegegbu 2014). However, there
are several mechanisms that will overtime cause a fully mixed store. The mechanisms that effect
the stratification are: if the incoming fluid jet stream is mixed with the fluid already in the tank
the kinetic energy of the flow can cause layers to mix, heat conduction along the tank walls will
convection and cause the cool water to go down lower in the storage, and heat transfer between
the different temperature layers. This event at which the thermal stratification degrades is called
destratification.

Figure 9 Different cases of temperature stratifications (a) relatively thin thermocline layer, (b) Thicker thermocline layer, (c)
completely destratified (Haller et al 2009)

The thickness of the thermocline is an indication of how much the stratification has degraded
(Waluyo & Majid 2010). The thermocline thickness depends on the different temperatures, the
thermocline moves downwards during the charging of a thermal energy storage used for
heating, and upwards during charging for a storage used for cooling.
There are two ways to calculate the thermal stratification of a thermal storage, the first of the
two alternatives are the multimode approach where the storage is divided into many sections
and an energy balance is formulated for every section (Duffie & Beckman 2013). The second
alternative is the plug flow approach where segments of the fluid at different temperatures are
moving through the storage. none of these are easy to calculate without computational fluid
dynamics software.
There are generally three things causing the destratification: The first one being the plume
entrainment caused by the natural convection within the tank driven by a thermal gradient, often

25

caused by the heating of the lower layers or cooling of the top layers. The second one is inlet
and outlet jet mixing caused by high velocities of the fluid. The third one is the thermal
conduction and diffusion within the different layers of water and the surrounding tank walls.
The stratification efficiency within a TES is ideally measured in range from 0% to 100% where
0% means that the storage is completely mixed and at a uniform temperature and 100% meaning
that the storage is fully stratified with a thin thermocline.
Most of the methods calculating the energy efficiency of a stratified thermal energy storage can
be divided into two subcategories: The first one being methods using the first law of
thermodynamics, and the second one being methods using the second law of thermodynamics.
In the first subcategory Chan et al, (1983) analysed the efficiency of charging and discharging
cycles with equation 44, representing the actual energy change at time t divided by the
maximum ideal plug flow replacement of the entire storage volume. This example demands
that the storage is at a completely uniform temperature initially.

𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 − 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖

(44)

Here the mstore is the mass of water in the storage in kilograms, Cp is the specific heat capacity
of water in kilojoules per kilogram Kelvin, Tini is the initial temperature, Tinlet is the inlet
temperature, Tavg(t) is the average temperature at time t, all temperatures are in Celsius. There
is also an alternative to equation 44 representing the actual energy change that would have
happened if there was ideal plug flow, this is defined by equation 45.

𝑡 ∗ 𝑚̇ ∗ 𝑐𝑝 ∗ (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑒𝑡 − 𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑖 )
𝑡∗

(45)

Here 𝑚̇ is the mass flow rate in kilograms per second, and t is the time in seconds. The second
subcategory involves using the second law of thermodynamics which states when two initially
isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium
with itself, but not with each other are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a
mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the entropies of the initially isolated systems
is less than or equal to the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when the
two original systems have all their respective intensive variables (temperature and pressure)

26

equal, this means that the final system also will have the same values. Rosengarten (1999)
defined equation 46 which is an equation for the non-dimensionalized exergy efficiency
calculated from the temperature gradient in the storage.

Geometry

2.7.1 Storage unit
Since all heat transfer is dependent on the surface area of the object observed, an ideal storage
tank in that aspect would be spherical due to the largest volume to surface ratio, but this is rarely
the case for CTES. At the moment the trend in Finland is to convert old underground oil storages
adjacent to powerplants to thermal energy storages. These oil storages are commonly cuboid
with a relatively square cross-section but long horizontally.
The geometry comparison between square and circular cross-section of a storage has little effect
on the thermocline development, but a taller aspect ratio of the storage contributes to a better
thermocline development in comparison to a short one (Çengel 2003). One other issue with
cubes and cuboid shapes is that they have larger heat losses in the corners of the surface due to
heat transfer in two or three directions (Eames & Norton 1997).

2.7.2 Diffusers
To promote thermal stratification diffusers can be used on the inlet and outlet of the thermal
energy storage. Diffusers are used so that the stream of the inlet or outlet does not cause jetmixing. There are several different types of TES diffusers available, the most common types of
diffusers can be divided into radial diffusers and slotted pipe diffusers. A radial diffuser also
called disc diffuser is essentially one or several horizontal disks that water flows over so that
the jet of the inlet fluid does not affect the thermal stratification negatively. A slotted pipe

27

diffuser is as the name states pipes with cut out slots that the fluid flows out of. The pipes can
be set up in different configurations such as in an H-pattern for a rectangular shaped storage or
octagonally for a circular storage. (Araner 2020)

Figure 10 Thermal energy storage tank with slotted pipe diffusers in an octagonal shape (on top) Thermal energy storage tank
with radial diffusers (below) (Araner 2020)

The velocity out of a radial diffuser can be defined by the following formula:
𝑣=

𝑄̇
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 ∗ 𝜋 ∗ 𝑥

(47)

Q̇ is the volume flow, ddiffuser is the diameter of the diffuser, and x is the distance between the
radial plates. configurations with several radial diffusers along the length of the TES tank could
be used. Another way to adjust the openings of the radial diffuser is to use a radially adjusted
diffuser (Chung et al 2008). Cross section pictured in figure 11.

28

Figure 11 Isometric picture and cross section of a radially adjusted radial diffuser

calculated with formula 48.

𝑣=

(48)

𝑛∗𝛼
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟 ∗ 𝜋 ∗ 𝑥 ∗ ( 360° )

α is the angle of the open sectors in the diffuser in degrees, and n is the number of open sectors.
For a H-pattern diffuser the velocity is calculated with formula 49.

𝑣=

𝑉̇
𝑛𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑠 ∗ ℎ𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡 ∗ 𝑙𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡

(49)

V̇ is the volume flow in cubic metres per second, nslots is the number of slots, hslot is the height
of the slot and lslot is the length of the slot, all distances are in meters.
There are different variables to use when comparing the characteristics of diffusers one of these
are called Froude number and is a ratio between the inertial forces of the ingoing or outgoing
stream and the buoyancy force (Motkar 2019). Which is shown in equation 50.

∆𝜌 2

(51)

Where vper inlet length depends on what kind of diffuser is used in the case of a radial diffuser it is
the flow rate per unit height of diffuser into the circumferential direction. If a slotted pipe
diffuser is used it is the inlet flow rate per length of diffuser. v is always the volumetric flowrate
per meter of diffusor in square meters per second. g is the gravitational acceleration in meters
per second squared. h is the height of the diffuser inlet in meters, ∆𝜌 is the density difference
between the hot and cold fluid in kilograms per cubic meter. 𝜌 is the density of the fluid at
ambient conditions in kilograms per cubic meter. The lower the Froude number is the less of a
negative impact the stream will have on stratification the recommend range for the Froude
number is to keep it below 2 (Chung et al 2008).
Another number for assessment of diffusor effect on stratification is the Richardson number
defined in equation 52 (Švarc, Seidl & Dvoák 2014).

𝑅𝑖 =

∆𝜌 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝐻

𝜌𝑚 ∗ 𝑣𝑖𝑛

(52)

Where ∆𝜌 is the difference between the initial density in the storage and the inlet density in in
kilograms per cubic meter, g is the gravitational acceleration in meters per second squared, H
is the height of the inlet in relation to the storage floor in meters, 𝜌𝑚 is the mean density of the
fluid in the storage in kilograms per cubic meter, and 𝑣𝑖𝑛 is the velocity of the fluid in meters
per second. The lower the Richardson number the less the jet effects the stratification (Chung
et al 2008).
The Reynolds number has also been shown to have a great impact on the stratification
degradation. Chung et al (2008) tested with a Reynolds number of 400, 800, and 1200 and the
difference between 800 and 1200 showed a larger difference than that between 400 and 800.
The Reynolds number is defined in equation 53.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Vaskiluoto energy storage as a living laboratory

The thermal energy storage on Vaskiluoto consists of two caves with a total volume of
210,000m3, the larger one has a volume of 150,000m3, and the smaller one being 60,000m3.
The smaller cave is used as an expansion chamber. The larger one that is used as the thermal
energy storage is 313 meters long and 30 meters high with a width that should be around 16
meters. The energy content of the storage at full charge is stated to be 7,000 to 9,000 megawatt
hours with a charging and discharging rate of 100 megawatts. Both caverns are situated 30
meters below ground level.

3.1.1 Thermal stratification
The measurements needed for the analysis of the thermal stratification within a CTES is the
sensor array along the height of the storage. From the array, information about the temperature
profile inside the storage can be gathered. The information about the temperatures in the CTES
can be used to calculate the energy content of the storage as well as the stratification efficiencies
according. In table 8 it is shown what the thermal profile of the storage could look like if it was
half charged and had an array with 11 sensors.

3.1.2 Heat loss analysis
There are many ways to calculate the heat losses of the storage. The heat flux through
convection from the fluid to the wall and the heat flux through conduction within the wall will
be constant once a steady state is achieved. When the storage is at a steady state two different
alternatives to calculate the heat loss can be used. One alternative is to measure the surface
temperatures, and with the help of equations 18 and 26 to 34 calculate the convection heat flux.
For convection calculations it is important that the thermal properties of the fluid are the ones
at film temperature, which means the average between the wall temperature and the initial
temperature of the fluid. The other alternative is to measure the conduction through the ground
with sensors in the bedrock at a distance from the CTES. The way to determine the heat losses
with sensors in the bedrock, would be by using the difference in temperature between two points
inline directly perpendicular away from the CTES by using equation 3. Note that with
conductive heat calculations the bedrock is assumed to be homogenous, and the surroundings
are at a steady state temperature.

To analyse the effect of jet mixing on the thermal stratification the dimensionless Froude,
Richardson and Reynolds numbers need to be calculated. The dimensionless numbers are
solved by equations 47, 48 and 49. Below in table 10 are the variables needed for the jet mixing

Testbed in Technobothnia

3.2.1 System description
With a testbed developed specifically for the research of thermal stratification, all the factors
that affect this should be tuneable so that different scenarios can be simulated. The three
parameters affecting thermal stratification is plume entrainment caused by convection, jet
mixing by inlet and outlet streams, and internal heat conduction. The convection can be adjusted
by changing the insulation around the tank. The jet mixing can be adjusted by changing
diffusors to diffusors with other properties. The internal conduction will largely depend on the
stratification efficiency, which depends on the convection and jet mixing.
The storage tank should be sufficiently large to get a good resolution of the thermocline but not
too large due to limited space and the energy consumption to charge the tank. One good measure
for the footprint of a testbed like this is the size of a euro pallet, that means that it can be moved
through double doors and can be moved with a pallet truck. A euro pallet has a footprint of 1.2
meters by 0.8 meters. If half of the footprint would be used for the TES tank and the rest for
auxiliaries the base area would be 600mm by 800mm and by removing about 100mm around
the sides for the insulation of the tank would leave 400mm by 600mm.
The Volume of the preheating tank is also proportional to the TES tank, so the volume of the
tanks does not get too large for the testbed. The height of the tank can be 500mm so that the
volume of the storage tank is 120liters, the tank should be made of 3mm thick sheet metal to
get a desired rigidity. The charging time of this TES should be limited due to the length of a
class if this testbed is used in educational purposes. The shorter the better but the possible
charging time will also depend on the desired volume flow through the diffuser.

3.2.2 Design of preheating tank
The preheating tank should be at least half the volume of the storage tank so that the middle of
the thermocline would be close to middle of the vertical axis of the TES tank, so in this case 60
litres. The temperature of the charging flow should be 90 degrees Celsius since that is the
common charging temperature of real-life thermal energy storage units. The heating element in
the tank should be dimensioned so that the water in the preheating tank could reach 90 degrees
within an acceptable time.
Another factor that can be taken into account is in case the whole storage tank needs to be filled
with hot water, in that case the cold water can be circulated through the preheating tank from
the cold side of the TES tank or batch wise, in two batches. We can assume that during the
charging there will be no considerable heat losses and the maximum electric energy that can be
used from a regular wall outlet with a 10-ampere fuse is about 2200W.

3.2.3 Pump dimensioning
The best solution would be to have pumps with an adjustable flow so that diffusers can be tested
at different flowrates as well. A suitable minimum amount of time for the charging of the
storage tank would be around 5 minutes in that case the pump should be dimensioned
accordingly. The pump between the preheating tank and the TES tank can also be used to
circulate the water in the preheating tank.

3.2.4 Heat losses a of the storage tank
The heat losses from the storage tank are caused by combined convection, conduction and if
the uninsulated also by radiation. The heat will travel first by natural convection inside the tank,
secondly through conduction through the tank wall, and after that, through convection to the
ambient air which is combined with radiation. The radiation heat transfer is assumed to be larger
if the tank is uninsulated since in that case a larger heat flux is desired. If insulation is added
the radiational heat loss is minimized due to a lower outside surface temperature and surface
coating with low emissivity.
The first heat transfer stage as in the natural convection between the hot fluid in the tank and
the inside surface of the tank wall cannot be calculated by itself since the temperature of the
surface is unknown and dependent on the rest of the stages of heat transfer. The heat losses are
calculated from a fully charged TES tank since this case will have the largest heat flux. In table
14 the relevant constants for the heat losses are gathered.

3.2.5 Diffuser variations
The jet mixing could be experimented with by exchanging diffusers depending on what
characteristics would be needed for the purpose and both radial and slotted pipe diffuser should
be possible for testing. This would be easiest to do by having a removable lid and connections
for the diffusers on the inside of the tank.
The velocity of the fluid through the diffuser can be varied by adjusting the openings in the
diffuser or by exchanging it with one that has different size openings. A radial diffuser can be
adjusted by increasing the distance between the radial plates and by doing that lowering the
velocity.
In an experiment conducted by J. D. Chung et al, diffusers with the Reynolds numbers 400,
800, and 1200 were used. These Reynolds numbers are recreated in the calculations as an
example. In table 15 the constants needed for the diffusor calculations are stated.

the stratification efficiency according to equation 46 was calculated. The stratification
efficiencies in equation 44 and 45 are time dependent and were left out because no time

3.3.2 Heat loss analysis
Two alternatives were used to calculate the heat losses, one scenario where a temperature sensor
is placed on the inside surface of the CTES wall. The other alternative was to use two thermal
sensors placed in the bedrock beside the CTES. The first alternative was to calculate the heat
flux from a given surface temperature of 89,9°C, the heat flux in this case was 47.9 Watts per
square meter.
The second alternative was tested by calculating the transient heat conduction in a semi-infinite
solid to get two realistic sensor values. The conduction heat flow between the sensors was
calculated and used to estimate the temperature on the surface inside the CTES. The surface
temperature was calculated to be 89.892°C and the surface temperature used for the simulation
was 89.9°C the calculations for this is in appendix 3. The calculated surface temperature can
be used to calculate the convection heat transfer within the storage as in the first case. All the
values are in table 17, and the calculations are shown in detail in appendix 2.

Testbed at Technobothnia

The results for the concept for a TES testbed in Technobothnia would consist of a system
including an isolated preheating tank, a charging pump, a storage tank with removable isolation,
a return pump, as well as pipes and fittings. As for the datalogging system the following inputs
are needed: preheating tank sensor, inlet temperature sensor, inlet flow sensor, temperature
sensor array within the TES tank, level sensor and an outlet temperature sensor.
The operation of the TES-tank testbed will start with the preheating. After the preheating tank
has reached the needed temperature the charging process will start. During charging the
charging/discharging pump will run to fill the TES-tank from the top while the return pump
pumps out fluid from the bottom of the TES tank to the preheating tank so that the tank does
not overflow. When the TES tank is charged to the required level the pumps stop. After this the
thermocline can be analysed until it has reached uniform temperature.

3.4.1 Technical and functional requirements
The basic system for the test bed should include the storage tank equipped with an array of
temperature sensors along the vertical axis, these should be equally spaced but with as short
distance between the sensors as possible to get a good resolution of the thermocline.
Temperature sensors around the perimeter inside the tank also could be of interest to analyse
the downward natural convection drafts in the corners in comparison to the walls. A premixing
tank with a heating element, where the water is continuously circulated and heated before it
enters the storage. Two pumps, one for charging and discharging of the system and one for that
pumps water from the TES tank to the preheating tank during charging and vice versa during
discharging. Figure 12 shows a basic process and instrumentation diagram of the system.

48

Figure 12 Process and instrumentation diagram for the proposed testbed at Technobothnia

The Preheating tank before the storage should be able to heat the charging water up to around
90 degrees Celsius, there is no need to go above the boiling point. After the preheating tank
there should be a pump for the charging and discharging of the storage, this pump can also be
used to circulate the water in the preheating tank. The charging and discharging pump is then
connected to a flowmeter and just before the storage tank a three-way valve for temperature
stabilization of the charging flow so that the cold water from the piping doesn’t affect the
temperature stratification. The return flow to the preheating tank should be routed through a
three-way valve so that the discharge flow can be routed back to the heating tank or to a drain.

3.4.2 Preheating tank
The preheating tank which should be as isolated to minimize heating time and will be mixed by
the charging and discharging pump. The heating element which should be as powerful as the
electrical connection will allow. This will give a preheating time of 2 hours and 13 minutes, if
the whole system is to be charged to 90 degrees Celsius the heating time will be 6 hours and 38
minutes. All the results of the calculations regarding the preheating tank and heating element
are shown in table 19, and the detailed calculations are in appendix 12.

Both the charging and discharging pump and the return pump is required to move the same
amount of fluid during charging and discharging within the given time constraint. For the
system to be able to be charged within 5 minutes the volume flow of the pump should be 0.72
cubic meters per hour. The pumps should have an adjustable flowrate for the adjustability of
the jet mixing.

3.4.4 Heat loss of the TES-tank
The suggested values in table 14 was put in the equations for the heat losses and heat flux. The
temperatures of the inside and outside surfaces of the TES tank were unknown. The inside
surface temperature was solved numerically with the help of the following formula:

𝑇𝑚𝑜𝑑 = 𝑇3 −

𝑞̇
ℎ4

(70)

Since the heat flux will stay the same through all layers of heat transfer, the same q̇ was used
in the conductive heat transfer of the steel tank walls as in the convection on both sides of it. h4
is the heat convection coefficient of the convection outside the TES-tank and T3 is the outside
surface temperature of the TES-tank. Due to all heat transfer calculations being dependant on
each other, the inside surface temperature was adjusted until T3 was equal to the ambient
temperature. During the calculations of an uninsulated TES-tank the radiative heat transfer
coefficient was added to the formula in the following way:

𝑇𝑚𝑜𝑑 = 𝑇3 −

𝑞̇
ℎ4 + ℎ𝑟

(71)

The results of these calculations are shown in table 21. The detailed calculations for the
uninsulated tank are in appendices 6 to 8, and the uninsulated case are in appendices 9 to 11.

5 DISCUSSION
In the Vaskiluoto case, investigated in this thesis, the only known parameters were the hot zone
and cold zone temperatures, the dimensions of the storage, the charging and discharging power
and the capacity. All the other variables had to be approximated to show how the calculations
can be done and the ongoing heat transfer phenomena demonstrated. In discussions with the
company, the hard part may be to receive more accurate information, there may be some
confidentiality issues since the owners of the thermal energy storage is a privately owned
company. The most obvious way that such data could be gathered by a university is by asking
for older data of within a specific interval. Heat losses as well as information about the thermal
stratification could be estimated and demonstrated from this data but not much in-depth studies
of different cases could be made. The ideal situation would be to have a live data feed from the
unit with all parameters needed. This cooperation between the university and the owner of the
Vaskiluoto energy storage can also prove to have mutual benefits. Since this CTES is in
commercial use, the data that would be received will show world issues and this can be the
basis of optimization proposals made by the university for the company.
The results of the calculations performed are probably not very far from reality, but the
calculations can be adapted for the real values easily, for example in the two different heat loss
analysis scenarios. For the first alternative that assumes that the surface temperature is 89.9°C,
in reality the surface temperature inside the CTES will be much closer to the fluid temperature
once the whole storage has reached a stable temperature. The alternative using two sensors
outside of the storage shows the correct inside surface temperature according to the calculations.
Although in the later alternative it can be seen that the heat flux is much lower than the heat
flux through convection on the inside of the CTES, in reality the heat flux should be somewhat
constant.
The values for the thermal stratification may be optimal in the provided example, but the
stratification efficiency and energy content calculations will work in the same manner for a
thicker thermocline. The other stratification efficiencies can be used when data regarding the
stratification degradation over time are received, these values are hard to anticipate without
access to any data.

53

The jet mixing calculations show an example for how to calculate the Froude, Richardson, and
Reynolds number. Since no real dimensions of the diffuser can be found, these are also very
hard to predict. The type of diffuser assumed in these calculations is a slotted pipe diffuser, but
one or several radial diffusors may also be in use. Since the equations for radial diffusors are
also presented in the theory chapter, if that is the case, it will be easy to adapt the calculations.
A TES tank test bed made at Technobothnia according to the suggested criteria in this thesis
would give a very versatile testing environment for educational and research projects. All the
needed adjustability for the phenomena effecting the thermal stratification is present in the
concept given in this thesis.
The heat losses through convection in the suggested TES tank would not be as small as in a real
CTES with the insulation used in these calculations, however more insulation could be added
when the testbed is made. The relatively high heat flux may be needed to speed up the
stratification degradation caused by heat transfer during simulations.
The diffusor used for the calculations is a slotted pipe diffusor, but different diffusors could
have been used to test the effects on the thermal stratification. Extreme cases of jet mixing can
be tested by simply removing the diffuser and leaving only the vertical pipes.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The effects on thermal stratification within a thermal energy storage have been studied since
the 1970s, which is a relatively short time. The behaviour of the thermal stratification is very
hard to predict, and computational fluid dynamics software is needed to simulate the
phenomena without access to a stratified thermal storage.
This thesis gives the groundwork for how these subjects can be researched in the future, but
both alternatives investigated in this thesis will need additional work before more practical, real
life studies or demonstrations of phenomena with real data can be commenced.
The alternatives studied in this thesis are fundamentally different; the Vaskiluoto case will be
a cavern thermal energy storage in commercial operation, and the Technobothnia testbed will
be solely used for research and education, so comparisons between them would be very
misleading. Both alternatives could, however, be used in parallel by comparing data between
the small TES tank in Technobothnia and the much larger scale Vaskiluoto CTES.
When data are available from Vaskiluoto, and when the storage has reached a steady state, the
heat losses from the storage could be solved with the help of the thermocline temperature data.
Since the temperature data from the vertical array shows the total energy content, it can be
assumed that the decrease in energy would be due to heat transfer to the surroundings. Ways of
differing the heat transfer due to internal conduction and heat transfer to surroundings need to
be defined but this would ultimately give an easier way to analyse the phenomena affecting the
thermal stratification.

The control system for the testbed should be fully automated due to the time requirements of
the testing. The data acquisition should gather the flow measurements in and out of the storage,
the temperature data from the charging and discharging flows as well as from the sensor array
within the storage. This data should be displayed in real time through a display on the testbed
or at an adjacent computer, and the datalogging should be able to log all the information for the
duration of time it would take for the stratification to degrade completely.

55

If there is a need for energy storage commissioning or faster thermocline degradation
simulations, there could be an interest in the possibility to lower the storage wall temperature
further than ambient temperature. In this case, the storage must be cooled; for a newly
commissioned CTES the inside surface temperature is often approximately 6°C, and this could
be achieved by cooling the surrounding walls. A separate cooling system could be made for
circulating water through a coil around the mantle and then to a chiller to keep the storage
surroundings at a steady temperature. An example of this system would consist of a cooling
mantle around the storage, a pump, and a sufficient chiller. The power of the chiller must be
determined by the temperature needed at the surface.
The internal conduction of the fluid could be tested by exchanging fluids to one with different
properties. To decrease the internal conduction further in the fluid, a membrane could be placed
in the storage tank to separate the hot form the cold side, but this may also cause the separation
of the hot and cold zones to two separate thermal gradients.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Metoder för att undersöka värmeförluster samt deras påverkan på temperaturstratifiering i ett
grottlager avsett för termisk energi
Inledning
Kylning och uppvärmning av byggnader står för ungefär 40 procent av den totala
energiförbrukningen i EU. Denna sektor är ökänd för att vara ineffektiv, ha stora förluster och
för att värmeproduktionen oftast är baserad på fossila bränslen. För att höja effektiviteten för
denna sektor är energilagring ett måste, och med detta kunde denna sektor vara en föregångare
i utfasningen av fossila bränslen. Om nuvarande och framtida ångbaserade kraftvärmeverk
skulle användas i kombination med energilagring och fjärrvärmenät kunde verkningsgraden
förbättras avsevärt.
För tillfället genomförs två projekt i Finland som handlar om storskaliga säsongslager av
termisk energi i grottor. Ett av dem är på Blåbärslandet i Helsingfors och det kommer att ha en
lagringskapacitet på 11,6 gigawattimmar och en laddnings- och urladdningskapacitet på 120
megawatt, samt en volym på 260 000 kubikmeter. Den andra finns på Vasklot i Vasa och det
kommer att ha en kapacitet på mellan 7 och 9 gigawattimmar och en laddnings- och
urladdningskapacitet på 100 megawatt samt en volym på 210 000 kubikmeter. Det finns även
en tredje i Uleåborg som blev klar för 20 år sedan samt flera av samma slag i Sverige. Alla
dessa har blivit byggda i grottor som tidigare har använts som underjordiska oljelager. Detta
visar att det finns ett stort intresse för att lagra termisk energi från de varmare
sommarmånaderna tills de kallare vintermånaderna när efterfrågan ökar.
I detta arbete studeras alternativen för att forska och undervisa i de fysiska fenomen som
förekommer

inom

ett

energilager

av

denna

typ,

såsom

värmeförluster

och

temperaturstratifiering och hur dessa fenomen påverkar varandra. Alternativen som kommer att
undersökas är att använda det termiska lagret på Vasklot som ett levande laboratorium eller att
bygga en småskalig variant för utbildningssyfte i Technobothnia. Forsknings- och
utvecklingslaboratoriet Technobothnia finns i Vasa och används av Yrkeshögskolan Novia,
Vasa universitet och Vaasan ammattikorkeakoulu.

57

Metod
I detta arbete har all information som krävs för att analysera värmeförlusternas och
jetblandningens inverkan på termoklin analyserats. Alla relevanta värmeförlustberäkningar har
samlats och deras inverkan på vätskan i lagret kan åskådliggöras genom beräkningar. Olika
typer av diffusorer har olika inverkan på jetblandingen och jämförs med hjälp Froudetal,
Richardsontal och Reynoldstal.

De olika delarna som ingår i testbädden analyseras och kraven på komponenterna räknas ut, till
exempel förvärmarens effekt, pumpens flöde, och skiktningstankens dimensioner. Dimensioner
på isolering samt diffusor uppskattas.
Resultat och diskussion
Resultaten från beräkningarna visas i tabellform utgående från de angivna värdena i
metoddelen. Eftersom få parametrar är kända i energilagret på Vasklot så har en stor del av
värdena antagits, bland annat diffusorns typ samt dimensioner, för att visa hur man kan beräkna
de olika dimensionslösa konstanter som diffusorerna jämförs med. Att få tillgång till värdena
som är okända kan bli svårt eftersom detta kan vara sekretessbelagd information. Men det kan
även vara ett attraktivt erbjudande för företaget eftersom det kan bidra med både bra publicitet
och optimeringsförslag. Att lagret är i kommersiellt bruk kan även vara en fördel ur
forskningssynpunkt eftersom man kommer att se för- och nackdelar i ett energilager som är i
bruk.
Resultaten som redovisas är antagligen inte långt från verkliga värden. Även om det
förekommer avvikelser jämfört med de verkliga okända konstanterna så kan beräkningarna
enkelt anpassas därefter, till exempel yttemperaturen i värmeförlustberäkningarna. I båda
värmeförlustberäknings metoderna vid Vasklot så har yttemperaturen inuti lagret antagits att
vara 89,9 °C. Denna temperatur kommer att vara närmare temperaturen hos vätskan i det
faktiska lagret när energilagret har nått en stabil temperatur.
Temperaturerna inuti lagret är antagna men även med en tjockare termoklin kommer
ekvationerna för energiinnehåll och stratifieringseffektiviteten att vara desamma. De
tidsberoende ekvationerna för stratifieringseffektiviteten har inte beräknats i detta arbete
eftersom sönderfallet av den termiska stratifieringen är svårt att anta utan några data.

58

En testbädd i Technobothnia byggd enligt de föreslagna kriterierna i detta arbete skulle ge en
väldigt mångsidig testbädd för forskning och utbildningssyften. All behövlig justerbarhet av
parametrar som påverkar stratifieringen finns i detta koncept.
Den termiska stratifieringen inom termiska energilager har undersökts sedan 1970-talet vilket
är en relativt kort tid. Stratifieringens beteende är väldigt svårt att förutse. För att simulera detta
beteende krävs särskild mjukvara för beräkning av strömningsdynamik eller en testbädd.
När data är tillgängliga från Vasklots energilager och lagret har nått en stabil temperatur kan
värmeförlusterna även beräknas från temperatursensorerna längs höjden i lagret. Eftersom
temperaturgradienten i lagret visar det totala energiinnehållet så kan man utgå från att all energi
som försvinner ur detta kommer att ledas ut genom väggarna. Via temperaturgradienten kan
man även se hur mycket den interna värmeledningen i vätskan bidrar till termoklinförfallet.
Om man med hjälp av testbädden vid Technobothnia skulle göra en simulering som kräver en
större värmeväxling, till exempel om man ska simulera uppstarten av ett underjordiskt termiskt
energilager så krävs kylning. Kylningen av denna testbädd skulle kräva ett separat kylsystem
bestående av en kylslinga, en pump och ett kylaggregat. I testbädden är det också möjligt att
använda sig av olika värmebärande vätskor för att minska den interna värmeledningen mellan
skikten. Ett membran kan även installeras mellan de varma och kalla skikten för att minimera
värmeledningen men detta kan bidra till helt nya egenskaper av testbädden.
Styrsystemet för testbädden borde vara helt automatiserat på grund av den långa tid som kan
krävas för en simulering. Datainsamlingen borde få alla temperatursignaler samt flödesmängder
och det ska finnas möjligheter att spara dessa data för vidare forskning.
Detta arbete utgör en grund för hur ämnet kan undersökas i framtiden, men båda alternativen
som är angivna i arbetet kommer att kräva mer undersökning innan mer praktiska
undersökningar av stratifieringen kan påbörjas.
De två alternativen som har undersökts i detta arbete är fundamentalt väldigt olika. Energilagret
på Vasklot är ett energilager i kommersiellt bruk och testbädden vid Technobothnia är avsedd
för forskning och utbildning, vilket medför att tillförlitliga jämförelser är svåra att göra. Båda

59

alternativen kan även användas parallellt för att jämföra skillnaderna hur lagret och testbädden
beter sig.
