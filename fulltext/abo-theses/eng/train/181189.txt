Available Module 2 Documents in Drug Submissions from Different Pharmaceutical
Companies

Documentation of clinical trials is surrounded by a jungle of directives and
recommendations, which are constantly growing. It has shown to be troublesome to interpret
what content the regulatory authorities want in the different submission documents.
Challenging interpretation of regulations and directives has left greater writing differences
between sponsors and it is important to implement new writing strategies that take these
regulatory changes into consideration. The writing strategy must focus on the content
necessary to grant a market approval as well as content demonstrating the benefit of the drug.
Additionally, transparency has become an essential part of the drug submission process.
The purpose of this research project was to investigate how different sponsors write their
publicly available clinical module 2.5 and 2.7 documents, and how well the CTD (Common
Technical Document) guideline was followed. Moreover, simplification suggestions were
prepared for the writing of module 2 documents based on the result findings.
Ten sponsors and 20 module 2 packages were randomly selected according to the scope of
the thesis. One package was downloaded from EMA's (European Medicines Agency)
website and one package from Health Canada's website per sponsor. The study design was
divided into a literature review followed by a quantitative evaluation and comparison of
different variables, including number of pages, tables and figures, number and structure of
level-1 headings and subheadings, and categorization of table content repetition in the
document text.
The results demonstrated that all CTD recommendations were generally followed, with an
exception of the recommendation for the document length. Various industry-wide
simplification suggestions were gathered from the results. The main suggestion was to
reduce the document length for both module 2.5 and 2.7 documents, in accordance with the
CTD guideline. To reduce the document length, it would be beneficial to consider to only
generate essential tables and figures, and to reflect what has been presented in the table
content compared to the body text. Other recommendations would be to reduce repetition,
to include cross-referencing and to consider whether it is vital to include extra subheadings
that are not recommended by CTD.
Simplifying the document writing process could impact resources and document quality and
increase trust between the public and the sponsor. All simplification suggestions might not
apply to every sponsor, although it is obvious that all sponsors should examine their
approaches and consider whether their documents could be simplified to a certain degree.

1 Introduction
In the pharmaceutical industry, good documentation practice is a requirement when
handling and recording data of a drug product to ensure quality. The simple rule is "if it
isn't documented, it didn't happen" (Vuolo, 2020), but could it be possible that excessive
resources are put into writing a document?
The number of regulations and recommendations are constantly growing. Increased
interpretation when writing the documents has become a challenge that should be
addressed. For some sponsors1 (meaning a pharmaceutical company) interpretation leaves
room for inclusion of redundant information, i.e., over-explanation and unnecessary
repetition, in the documents of the MAA (marketing authorization application).
When a sponsor is applying for a marketing authorization of a drug product2 in Europe,
i.e., EMA (European Medicines Agency), an MAA must be submitted. An MAA contains
many different documents from both pre-clinical and clinical studies and all
documentation necessary for an MAA is structured in five different modules (1 to 5),
according to the CTD (Common Technical Document) guidelines:
❖ Module 1 - region-specific administrative and prescribing information
❖ Module 2 - overviews and summaries of module 3 to 5
❖ Module 3 - quality of pharmaceutical documentation
❖ Module 4 - non-clinical reports of pharmacology and toxicology
❖ Module 5 - clinical study reports from clinical trials. (EMA, 2004).
The regulatory authority will review the data from these studies and a recommendation
for a marketing authorization is based on a voting system, which will disclose a positive
or negative opinion. The sponsor must submit a proposal package of redacted and
anonymized versions of the clinical documents from the submitted application. This
package is to be made publicly available soon after the authority decision on the marketing
authorization or withdrawal of the application by the sponsor themselves. The publicly

available documents are the module 2 and 5 clinical documents from the CTD structure.
The availability is the result of what is known as transparency rules. (EMA, 2004; EMA,
2018).
Transparency has taken up a major role in the pharmaceutical industry and the reasons for
this are many. According to the World Health Organization, a key element to create safe,
effective and good-quality drugs is transparency in governance. Transparency is also an
inevitable prerequisite of fair pricing (WHO, 2018). In this respect, transparency is vital
to create trust between the public and the pharmaceutical industry and to provide
opportunities for anyone to analyze different studies and to form a personal perception of
a particular product. Transparency will also force innovative thinking and create research
opportunities for other companies. The transparency rules are continuously being updated
and implemented to an increased degree, with the latest rules for Europe and Canada
being:
❖ EMA Clinical Data Publication, also known as Policy 0070
❖ HC (Health Canada) PRCI (Public Release of Clinical Information) (EMA, 2019;
Health Canada, 2019a).
The guidelines prepare the sponsor for publishing module 2 and 5 documentation from
the MAA. In other words, these documents are publicly available to be analyzed and
downloaded from portals maintained by EMA and HC, and it is important to keep in mind
that the information in these public documents can be read by anyone. (EMA, 2019;
Health Canada, 2019a).
Before publishing the documents, personal data and confidential information must be
redacted or anonymized to protect the individuals who participated in or conducted the
clinical trials that the MAA is based on. Protection of the patients who participated in the
trials is paramount. In addition, other information (such as previously mentioned
unnecessary repetition) that is considered redundant to grant a marketing authorization
could be removed. (EMA, 2019; Health Canada, 2019a).
For this research, publicly available module 2 clinical documents were chosen for
analysis. Module 2 is divided into seven subsections, however, only module 2.5 and 2.7
2

Ronja Forstén

are made publicly available. Module 2.5 presents a clinical overview whilst module 2.7 is
split into four different documents: 2.7.1 Summary of Biopharmaceutic Studies and
Analytical Methods, 2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies, 2.7.3 Summary of
Clinical Efficacy and 2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety.
Altogether 20 module 2 packages from the MAA, published by EMA or HC and prepared
by 10 different pharma sponsors, were chosen for the thesis evaluation. One module 2
package refers to the publicly available documents of the module sections 2.5, 2.7.1, 2.7.2,
2.7.3, and 2.7.4. All EMA packages were initial MAA packages and the HC packages
were either NDS (New Drug Submission) or NDS-NAS (New Drug Submission - New
Active Substance). Selected variables were compared between the documents and, with
this approach, the writing strategies of different sponsors were investigated.
The following objectives of the research were studied:
❖ To measure structural differences in 20 module 2 packages from 10 different
sponsors
❖ To measure data repetition between tables and paragraph text in module 2.5 and
2.7.4 documents
❖ To evaluate suggestions for possible documentation simplification
The aim of this research project has been to consider whether the writing strategies could
be simplified and if any simplification suggestions could be implemented for the
preparation of publicly available module 2 documents. The documents were compared,
their relation to the sponsors was analyzed, and the results were compared to the CTD
guidelines for module 2 documents to investigate how well the guideline was followed.
This is a general analysis of the industry to create a baseline for future awareness and
process changes. It is essential to understand the importance of strategies being
implemented in early writing and to realize the necessity of not only writing a good
document, but also understanding how certain information is handled and what kind of
processes take place after the document has been written.

1.1 Background
A drug’s lifecycle (Figure 2) starts in the research and development (R&D) department.
When an active ingredient has been identified and combined with excipients, a drug is
created. The optimized drug is then evaluated through various pre-clinical testing stages:
❖ In silico - computerized testing
❖ In vitro - tests performed outside of a living organism (e.g., tubes, glasses, agar
plate)
❖ In vivo - tests performed in living organisms (animals)
The data are gathered from pre-clinical testing and sent to the authorities and if the results
are promising enough, a permission to start clinical trials is granted. (E.L. Andrade, 2016).

Clinical trials are conducted in humans to investigate the best way of diagnosing and
treating a disease. Scientists and doctors are operating the trials, which are divided into
four phases described in Table 1. Note that the number of humans in each phase is an
approximation per study. However, one complete phase 1 package will include numerous
studies. (David J. Kerr, 2006).

When clinical trials are carried out, extensive work is required in collecting samples and
data, composing documents, and following guidelines. All trials are recorded and
documented in a detailed and regulated way. When all the necessary information is
assembled in a dossier and guidelines applied, a submission-ready marketing authorization
application package is compiled, hereinafter referred to as an MAA. This package, which
may include thousands of pages of text, numerous graphs, figures, and other important
information, will be submitted to and reviewed by the authority concerned, and if the

5

Ronja Forstén

collected information is qualified, a MAA can be granted. (EMA, 2019; Health Canada,
2019a).
Certain documents from the MAA are collected in databases that allow the public to view
the documentation. The publicly available clinical documents (module 2.5, 2.7 and
module 5 CSRs (clinical study reports)) contain sensitive information and must comply
with transparency guidelines, which involve guidance on redaction and anonymization
approaches before publishing. (EMA, 2019; Health Canada, 2019a).

2 Literature review
This literature review is a selective approach, where a limited number of guidelines from
Europe and Canada are analyzed, related to the CTD (Common Technical Document),
MAA and new transparency regulations.
The following documents have been studied:
❖ ICH Topic M4, Common Technical Document for the Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use – Organization Common Technical Document.
(CPMP/ICH/2887/99)
❖ Obtaining an EU marketing authorisation, step-by-step by EMA
❖ European Medicines Agency policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal
products for human use - EMA/144064/2019
❖ External guidance on the implementation of the European Medicines Agency
policy on the publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use EMA/90915/2016 (version 1.4)
❖ Public Release of Clinical Information: guidance document by Health Canada
(version 1.0)

2.1 Common Technical Document (CTD)
The data from pre-clinical and clinical phases are presented in various document types
and these are filed to the regulators as part of the MAA. All documents submitted to the
authority must follow a certain structure and these structural guidelines are often provided
by ICH (International conference on Harmonisation), although some countries follow
their own national guidelines. (ICH, n.d.).
ICH has provided over 60 different guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry. These
guidelines include quality, safety, efficacy, multidisciplinary (cross-cutting topics),
MedDRA3 and CTD. All guidelines are equally important, although the emphasis in this
thesis is on CTD and its common format to accumulate all the quality, safety and efficacy
data. The European Regulatory Authorities require all MAA documentation to be CTD
ready (EMA, 2004). The regulatory authorities that are following the ICH guidelines
operate with the same document format (ICH, n.d.).
ICH is responsible for the maintenance of the different guidelines, including the guideline
for the CTD dossier. Europe, Japan and the US all have their specific directions for what
submission-ready documents should look like. This involves, for example, directions for
summaries and table preparations. The CTD was designed by implementing all three
region-specific regulations to ensure that the structure of documents is comparable.
Today, the CTD format has also been adopted in other countries, such as Canada and
Switzerland. (Jordan, 2014).
The CTD guideline contains specifications for how sponsors are recommended to create
documents for an MAA. The CTD dossier comprises five different modules. These
modules all represent a certain section necessary for registration of human
pharmaceuticals. Every module contains detailed instructions on how to format the
documents. When companies follow the CTD standards, time and resources are reduced,
as all documents have the same formatting structure. A global standard makes it easier to
read and find information, both for the regulatory authorities and among companies.
(EMA, 2004, p. 3).

The general rules concerning the CTD are available and are as follows:
❖ Style and size of the font should be easily readable and must therefore be large
enough, particularly text within tables or figures
❖ Recommended style in narrative text is Times New Roman with a 12-point font
❖ Document information must be clear, transparent and easy to review
❖ All pages must follow sequential numbering, and acronyms as well as
abbreviations are to be spelled out the first time when mentioned in a module
❖ Margins are to be arranged with the aim of printable documentation in formats of
A4 paper in Europe and Japan; 8.5 x 11'' paper in the US
❖ To avoid text being obscured in documents that are banded together, the left
margin should be adequately wide
❖ References are cited according to the latest version of ICMJE (Uniform
Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors). (EMA, 2004, pp. 3-4).
The five different sections of the CTD dossier are module 1 to 5 (Figure 3):
1 - Administrative information and prescribing information, however, this module is
region specific and the content and format do not follow CTD specific rules; 2 - overviews
and summaries of module 3 to 5; 3 - quality of pharmaceutical documentation; 4 - nonclinical reports of pharmacology and toxicology; 5 - clinical study reports from clinical
trials. (EMA, 2004, p. 4).

Figure 3. The Common Technical document can be illustrated in a triangle figure. The figure is a re-creation as a
summary of ICH M4Q, M4S and M4E guidelines. This thesis focuses on module 2 documents.

All modules are further divided into sections and subsections. However, as the scope of
the thesis is publicly available module 2 documents, the focus is on the structure of these
documents. The documents are summary introductions of the drug, its pharmacological
class, action and clinical use. The following content is available in module 2: (2.1) CTD
Table of Contents, (2.2) CTD Introduction, (2.3) Quality Overall Summary, (2.4)
Nonclinical Overview, (2.5) Clinical Overview, (2.6) Nonclinical Written and Tabulated
Summaries, (2.7) Clinical Summary. Additionally, each and every one of these documents
contains level-1 headings (see section 4.3) and sponsors might also choose to include
additional level-1 headings, which are out of scope for the CTD structure. These level-1
headings may also be further divided into subheadings, depending on the document.
(EMA, 2016).
Only two of the seven documents in module 2 are publicly available: Clinical Overview
(2.5) and Clinical Summary (2.7) documents. Their sections and level-1 headings are
presented in Table 2. Note that the clinical overview only contains one document, whilst
the clinical summaries are divided into four separate documents. (EMA, 2016).
In accordance with the CTD recommendations, the clinical overview should be a short but
detailed ca. 30-page description of the development plan, which involves safety, efficacy

risk analyses, biopharmaceutics and clinical pharmacology. The development plan of
evidence shows completed, initiated and planned studies. The clinical summaries are more
detailed than the clinical overview and document length of the full module 2.7 summary
document (module 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4 combined) is recommended to be between 50
and 400 pages. (EMA, 2016).

2.2 Obtaining marketing authorization in Europe
MAA evaluation is the process that a new drug must go through in order to have a
permission to place the drug on the market. A marketing authorization in the EU may
result from a centralized procedure, a decentralized procedure, mutual recognition
procedure or a national authorization procedure. (EMA, 2019). A more detailed
description is found in Table 3.

As most of today’s new medicines are granted marketing authorization via the centralized
procedure, the focus will be on this route. In addition, EMA Policy 0070 only applies to
the centralized procedure applications. (EMA, 2019).
The MAA can moreover be divided into three different approval types: standard,
conditional approval or exceptional circumstances (see Table 4). (EMA, 2015).

This thesis concentrates mainly on the European authority processes, but it is good to
remember that various authorities process the MAAs depending on the region in which
the approval is applied. In Europe, the applications are handled by EMA, but in Canada
similar applications are handled by Health Canada and in the US by FDA 4 . When a
pharmaceutical company applies for an authorization to market its drug, the applicant
must consider in which region to hold the authorization and which specific rules are to be
followed. The regulatory authority will review and possibly approve the request once the
applicant has a drug MAA prepared. For all authorities, a submission arrangement consists
of a pre-submission meeting, administrative review, agency review, sponsor response and
agency decision. (EMA, n.d. (c); Health Canada, 2019b; FDA, New Drug Application
(NDA), 2019).
2.2.1

Marketing authorization process

When phase 1 to 3 trials are conducted and a favorable benefit-risk profile5 is proven, a
product is ready to be marketed (Patrick Waller, 2017). The market evaluation starts with
submission of CMC quality data (meaning chemistry, manufacturing and controls data to
ensure safety, efficacy and batch consistency) and data from pre-clinical and clinical
phases. The data are evaluated by the CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use), i.e., a function within EMA. Additional experts might be consulted by EMA
as needed during this process and the sponsor can be asked to complement the already
submitted data with clarifications or additional analysis. At the end of the process, a
4

NDA (New Drug Application) is the FDA corresponding term to EMA’s MAA

5

14

Ronja Forstén

decision is made by a formal vote within the CHMP, and the product is either approved
or refused. However, as EMA has no power to make a final decision under EU law, the
recommended decision is forwarded to the European Commission which then makes a
final legally binding decision (Figure 4) (EMA, 2019).

2.2.2

Submission flowchart

As seen in Figure 5, the centralized procedure for marketing authorization is a review
process lasting 201 days, excluding the time it takes for the sponsor to provide feedback.
The sponsor sends an MAA to EMA on day 0 and within two weeks EMA should validate
the application. If the application meets all necessary validation criteria it is forwarded to
the CHMP, which starts the evaluation process. The day the CHMP initiates the data
evaluation, the review clock starts from day 0. The committee has 120 days to evaluate
the data and questions are then send back to the sponsor. When the sponsor receives the
feedback, the review clock stops, and it is only continued once the responses are provided
by the sponsor back to EMA. The sponsor has a maximum of three months to submit the
answers. When the sponsor has forwarded the answers to EMA, the responses are handled
by the CHMP and the review clock continues (day 121). The CHMP then has 89 days to
come to a final decision - approval or refusal (day 210). (EMA, 2019).

If the CHMP decides to refuse the marketing authorization, the sponsor has the right to
appeal and garner a second opinion. When and if a drug is approved by the CHMP,
essential information is passed on to the European Commission, the member states and
the applicant6:
❖ CHMP’s opinion
❖ An assessment report
❖ A summary of product characteristics
❖ Labelling
❖ Package. (EMA, 2019).
After the information transfer, EMA will publish an EPAR (European Public Assessment
Report). This report is published for drugs that are granted a MA through the centralized
procedure (also used for suspended or withdrawn products). In this report, a simple
process overview summary (in a question and answer format) and package leaflet are
found. (EMA, 2015).
2.2.3

Involved committees in the MAA process

CHMP is involved in the regulatory process together with multiple other committees, as
applicable. COMP (Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products), CAT (Committee for
Advanced Therapies) and PDCO (Paediatric Committee) are committees that can be
involved in pre-submission processes. CHMP, CAT, PDCO, PRAC (Pharmacovigilance
Risk Assessment Committee) and COMP can participate in the MAA evaluation phase
and CHMP and PRAC might also be included in later post marketing authorization
processes. See Figure 6. (EMA, 2015; EMA, n.d. (a)).

2.3 Transparency in Europe and Canada
Today, it is truly important that clinical information, to a great extent, reaches the public
domain and that region-specific transparency guidelines are followed before information
is published. The reasons for transparency are mainly:
❖ To create trust between the public and the pharmaceutical industry
❖ To provide opportunities for anyone to analyze different studies and to create a
personal perception of a particular product
❖ To force innovative thinking and create research opportunities for other

companies. (European Clinical Research Infrastructure (ECRIN), n.d.; EMA,
n.d. (d)).
Innovative thinking and strategy changes are key for pharma companies when applying
the transparency policies. Previously, the submission-ready documents were only seen
by the authorities and were closed for the general public, which lead to situations where
excessive information might have been put into the documents, for different reasons.
When applying the transparency guidelines, the strategy has had to change, and only
vital information is to be put into the documentation. This way fewer resources are
required for retrospective work. (personal communication, 31 Jul 2020).
Europe and Canada have determined to make drug approval decisions as accessible as
possible, and data collection and processing has formed what the transparency
guidelines are today. (Health Canada, 2019a; EMA, n.d. (d)).
The transparency guidelines concern documents that are to be published after an MAA
has been approved, refused or withdrawn. The publicly available clinical documents are
found on EMA’s and Health Canada’s websites, respectively. The authorities handle the
regulations regarding the transparency of the documents. Both authorities have their
specific rules and the sponsor must ensure that these rules are properly implemented for
each region. Along with document publishing, the sponsor must ensure that sensitive
information is anonymized or redacted. (Health Canada, 2019a; EMA, n.d. (d)).

18

Ronja Forstén

A various number of guidelines regarding transparency has been written and applied
throughout the years. Continuous updates and new guidelines have led to where we stand
today. The requirements and the guidelines will continuously develop as the authorities
gain further experience and have a more complete documentation systems for publishing.
The final result of this implementation is expected to bring about publications of all
clinical trials, regardless of the results. (European Clinical Research Infrastructure
(ECRIN), n.d.; EMA, n.d. (d)).
The development of clinical trial transparency can be divided into three phases Figure 7:

trials for public
registration

Figure 7. Implemented guidelines in Europe throughout the years. These are only examples of many implementations
(NIH; EMA, 2019; EudraCT, n.d.).

EudraCT stands for European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials and is a
database where data are collected on drugs in clinical trials in EU and EEA (EudraCT,
n.d.). The clinical trials register holds information on clinical trials conducted in the EU
and EEA, these results are then entered to the EudraCT database (EMA, 2021a). The latest
guidelines for transparency have been implemented in Europe (EMA Policy 0070) as
recently as 2015. The implementation of these guidelines has made it possible for this
research to exist, as module 2.5 and 2.7 documents now must be publicly available and,
therefore, can be analyzed (European Clinical Research Infrastructure (ECRIN), n.d.;
EMA, n.d. (d)).

19

Ronja Forstén

2.4 EMA Policy 0070
EMA Policy 0070, also known as Clinical Data Publication (CDP), refers to the European
Medicines Agency and their policy on the publication of clinical data for medicinal
products for human use. EMA Policy 0070 is the flagship policy and reason for the
opportunity to download module 2 documents from the clinical data publication portal of
EMA.
2.4.1

Brief introduction

The policy is divided into two phases: phase 1 and phase 2. Phase 1 has been implemented
since January 2015, and phase 2 will only come into effect later. Hence, in scope of this
thesis is information associated with phase 1 alone.
EMA Policy 0070 and the external guidance documents are available to provide assistance
on how to manage anonymization and redaction processes before the documents are to be
published on EMA’s website. The policy provides guidance on anonymization of PPD
(Protected Personal Data), identification and redaction of CCI (Commercially
Confidential Information) in clinical reports, and practical standpoints when submitting
clinical reports. These are all necessary processes that must be accomplished before the
documents can be published in the EMA portal. (EMA, 2018, p. 6; EMA, 2019).
An external guidance document "External guidance on the implementation of the
European Medicines Agency policy on the publication of clinical data for medicinal
products for human use" was created to further clarify how to implement EMA Policy
0070, which includes following information:
❖ External guidance on the procedural aspects related to the submission of clinical
reports for the purpose of publication in accordance with EMA Policy 0070
❖ External guidance on the anonymization of clinical reports for the purpose of
publication in accordance with EMA Policy 0070
❖ External guidance on the identification and redaction of commercially confidential
information in clinical reports submitted to EMA for the purpose of publication in
accordance with EMA Policy 0070. (EMA, 2018; EMA, 2019).
20

2.4.2

Anonymization and redaction

Redaction and anonymization of clinical data takes place before the documents are placed
on the public website. Clinical data refers to all clinical documents and IPD (Individual
Patient Data). Anonymized information refers to visible re-constructed data resulting in a
low risk of individual identification, whereas redaction is a way of masking the data
completely. As a rule, while redaction is the only option available for CCI, the authority
prefers anonymization of PPD where possible. It should also be mentioned that Health
Canada accepts submissions of redacted and anonymized packages that have previously
been published under EMA Policy 0070. (EMA, 2018; Health Canada, Public Release of
clinical Information: guidance document, 2019a).
2.4.3

Submission flowchart

In general, all submitted clinical documents of module 2.5, 2.7 and module 5 CSRs are to
be published. In addition, other documentation must be included, such as justification
tables and an anonymization report, and the dossier containing all these documents is
called a submission package. (EMA, 2018).
EMA intends to publish the submission package 60 days after the European Commission
decision of the MAA (EMA, 2021b). The sponsor sends the redaction proposal of the
submission package through an e-submission gateway to EMA. The submission package
contains the module 2 and CSR documents with proposed redactions, a table of
justification for each document with a declaration text for CCI redactions and an
anonymization report for PPD protection/redaction. The applicant will receive a receipt
of the submitted package. Consultation takes place during the following 47 days. EMA
reviews the justification tables, redaction proposals, anonymization report and sends
comments to the applicant through the secure file transfer system, Eudralink. The
applicant will then respond to the justification table comments made by EMA. In the final
stage of conclusion process, a redaction conclusion notification is sent by EMA and a

21

Ronja Forstén

consultation agreement is accepted by the applicant. During the following 27 days, after the redaction conclusion notification,
the final redacted submission package is updated by the sponsor, including an updated cover letter and anonymization report.
Simultaneously EMA ensures that the EPAR (European Public Assessment Report) is updated and the European Commission
decision received. EMA will then send an acknowledgement receipt and submission acceptance email. The package is final
when the clinical documents in question are redacted and accepted by the authority. A final version of the redacted document
is now ready to be published and a watermark and document protection is added before the documents are placed on the public
website (EMA, 2018, p. 16). This process is illustrated in Figure 8.

The consultation in detail

As soon as EMA has received the proposal document package, the task will be assigned
to a team member. EMA performs a technical validation of the justification tables and a
review of the anonymization report within 10 days. If applicable, the applicant must
clarify the CCI approaches within 5-7 days. The consultation process is ensured via
Eudralink. If clarification is requested but without an attached response, the proposal will
be rejected. At the end, on day 47 at the latest, a final conclusion is sent to the applicant
regarding the CCI evaluation and anonymization report recommendations or comments.
If the anonymization report requires an update, a response is expected no later than day
61. EMA has 7 days to respond to the updated anonymization report. An agreement ought
to be reached for the final redacted documents by day 74. See Figure 9. (EMA, 2018, pp.
31-32).

Health Canada PRCI

Health Canada released, in the beginning of 2019, a corresponding guidance to EMA
Policy 0070, called Health Canada PRCI. These regulations use Canada-specific
terminology and the PRCI abbreviation stands for Public Release of Clinical Information.
Health Canada PRCI is the reason for the opportunity to download module 2 documents
from the clinical information portal of Health Canada. (Health Canada, 2019a).
2.5.1

Brief introduction

Health Canada PRCI guidance is available to provide instructions on how to manage
anonymization and redaction processes when applying for marketing authorization of drug
packages in Canada and after this publishing the documents online. This guidance has
been created with the awareness of the Privacy Act of Canada - a federal legislation from
1983 amplifying how personal information is to be dealt with. (Health Canada, 2019a).
Compared to EMA Policy 0070, PRCI covers both drug submissions and medical device
applications. In addition, some differences in wording exist, e.g., EMA addresses
confidential information as commercially confidential information (CCI), while HC’s
corresponding terminology is confidential business information (CBI) (Health Canada,
2019a). Likewise, protected personal data (PPD) in the EMA regulation is comparably
defined as personal information (PI) in HC guidelines (Office of the Privacy
Commissioner of Canada, 2019).
Equivalent anonymization and redaction rules, mentioned in section 2.4.2, apply for
Canada (Health Canada, 2019a).
2.5.2

Submission flowchart

The public release of clinical information is divided into five phases and should be
completed within 120 days of the process start (Figure 10). When a submission review of
a drug package has started and is accepted, the applicant will receive a notice of the PRCI
process. (Health Canada, 2019a).

26

Ronja Forstén

This notice will request the applicant to redact the documents that will be published. These documents should be modified
within 60 days to comply with the editing rules set by Health Canada PRCI. During this time, the applicant also has an
opportunity to initiate a meeting (process initiation meeting, PIM) with HC where the applicant can discuss and clarify
requirements regarding PRCI. This meeting should take place between 120 days before HC makes its final decision on the
submitted drug package and 20 days after this decision is made. A redaction CBI control sheet, equivalent to EMA’s justification
tables, should be included in the submission package together with the PI anonymization report. The proposed redactions will
be reviewed by HC and the applicant’s proposals will be either accepted, partially accepted or rejected. An alternative option is
to request a submission of previously redacted documents approved by EMA. The final package should be submitted for
publication via the Common Electronic Submission Gateway (CESG) and thereafter, according to the transparency guidelines,
it will be openly published on HC’s clinical information website, for all to read. (Health Canada, 2019a).

Similar to EMA, HC has several application categories that are in scope of the PRCI,
as applicable. The wording, however, is quite different from the EMA guidelines and

HC has divided their transparency implementations into four stages: year 1, year 2,
year 3, year 4. In year 1, NDS-NAS, SNDS-c, Rx-switch submissions and COVIDrelated (IO/SNDS) are published. In year 2, proactive publication of clinical
information is valid for all NDS (meaning both new active substances and those which
do not fall under this category), SNDS-c and Rx-switch. For year 3, all SNDS are to
be proactively published. For instance, these can be applications for new indications
of an existing product. Year 4 involves implementing ANDS, which refers to generic
drugs. HC also implements medical devices in year 3 and 4, which is not brought up
as essential information in this thesis. Note that some steps are yet to be implemented
and the different stages, referred to as year 1 to 4, are not equal to calendar years. All
drug submissions (and device applications) which already have final regulatory
decisions remain subject to release on request. (Health Canada, 2019a; Bayer, Personal
Communication, 2021).

3 Aims
3.1 Goals
The thesis intends to measure sponsors’ module 2.5 and 2.7 documentation and writing
approaches from a medical writing standpoint and, hopefully, find guiding tools to
proceed with a simplification process, while ensuring that relevant content is still
provided. However, it is important to remember that the writing strategies depend on
both the sponsor’s approaches and the document’s structure, which may vary due to
different indications, active substances and excipients. As certain details are
impractical to compare between sponsors, this thesis is designed to investigate on a
more surface level and to create a base for future research.
The purpose is to clarify whether extensive variations between sponsors’ writing
approaches appear and whether something can be learned from these analyses. The
current standards for document writing and information redaction are remarkably
time-consuming and require numerous resources. It would be beneficial to be able to
eliminate redundant and repeated information in the documents.
The long-term goal is to reduce time, improve the writing quality and minimize the
redaction requirement. The aim is to make every sponsor that is dealing with MAAs
aware of the simplification suggestions developed from the findings and of how they
can be implemented in their daily work.

3.2 Objectives
The two main objectives for identifying writing simplification possibilities in publicly
available module 2 documents are presented in Figure 11.

Figure 11. The main goals and research questions for the research project.

The objectives in Figure 11 are achieved by evaluating publicly available module 2
documents from submission packages published as part of EMA Policy 0070 and HC
PRCI processes, and prepared by ten different pharma sponsors. The following
questions are answered in the results, conclusion and discussion to support the
objectives:
❖ What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from the
different sponsors?
❖ How well is the CTD guideline followed?
❖ What are the possible simplification suggestions?
The author aims to clarify the objectives by analyzing what kind of variations are found
in the collected results. As a conclusion, the results are further compared to the CTD
guideline to investigate whether all sponsors are following the recommendations.
Moreover, possible simplification suggestions will be prepared for writing of module
2 documents based on the findings.

31

4 Methodology
The research is divided into two parts: an independent part and a collaborative part.
The independent work concerned downloading the chosen documents. The documents
were viewed, quantitative data were collected, and finally a comparison of the writing
strategies and document structures were processed. The author determined that the
most convenient way to collect and compare data to conduct the research was by
following the approach described in section 4.3.
The collaborative part involved a global expertise team who discussed, analyzed and
evaluated the collected variable data. The collaboration team also discussed additional
ways to contribute to an industry-broad recommendation for writing module 2
documents.
The validity and reliability of this research will undergo substantial comparison,
evaluation and discussion with senior team members. As this is a pioneer research
subject, the trustworthiness will depend on the outcome of this research followed by
future research findings. The research activities are described in Figure 12.

Figure 12. A 6-month research schedule divided into different topics.

A timetable has been created to delineate the total workload. Initiation meetings were
held to hone the research questions, and document downloading could then begin after
careful preparation. After downloading the desired documents, the evaluation was
32

conducted. The author’s findings were then communicated with the rest of the team
and actions towards a documentation simplification process were initiated.

4.1 Literature review
In order to have a better understanding of the module 2 documents, a literature review
of the CTD, MAA process, and EMA and HC transparency guidelines was conducted.
The CTD describes the rules concerning document structure that are essential for the
MAA, and the MAA process clarifies the road from an investigational drug to market
access and the transparency guidelines clearly state what is meant by transparency, its
necessity and how to apply this within the documents.

4.2 Documents and sponsors
One submission package may include hundreds of documents and thousands of pages,
which is too much data for a master’s thesis evaluation. Therefore, the scope of this
thesis research solely concerns publicly available module 2 documents.
To be able to download the module 2 documents, the author registered in the EMA
web portal. Downloading documents from the HC portal only requires the reader to
agree with the terms of use, while EMA requires passport or ID information to be
entered as well as a reason to be stated for full access. There are two types of
registration for accessing the EMA portal: standard and academic. Only an academic
registration allows full access, enabling documents to be downloaded or searched for
specific words. After registering, the author was allowed to download the published
module 2 documents.
In this thesis, one module 2 package refers to the publicly available documents of the
five modules: 2.5, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4. Altogether 20 module 2 packages were
downloaded from EMA and HC web portals and the packages are from ten different
pharma sponsors. The sponsors were randomly selected, however, each sponsor
chosen had to have a published module 2 package in both portals. The reason for
evaluating more than one package per sponsor is to understand documentation
differences within a single sponsor.
Because some EMA activities have been suspended and new submission packages are
on hold (excluding Covid-19 products), the author has concluded that the most valid
33

option is to download one module 2 package from the EMA portal and the other
module 2 package from the HC portal, for every sponsor. The HC portal contains the
latest submission packages and is, therefore, important when investigating the
document structures of each sponsor for the document simplification initiation, while
EMA is limited to somewhat older submission packages with possibly outdated
writing strategies.
The scope of document-type examination is limited to initial MAA packages for EMA,
and NDS-NAS and NDS packages for HC (see sections 2.4.5 and 2.5.3). The lack of
variability when choosing the submission packages from corresponding portals must
be highlighted, especially when emphasizing new drug substances. This is due to the
newly launched portals and the fact that document downloading of submission
packages has just come to life.

4.3 Variables
At the time of the document downloading, the following information was recorded:
❖ Indication, first-in-class8, publication year and document type
The following variables were chosen for quantitative evaluation and comparison:
❖ Number of pages
❖ Number of tables7
❖ Number of figures
❖ Number and structure of level-1 headings and subheadings
❖ Categorization of table9 content repetition in the text
The variables are measured as differences within the documents and means and
averages are calculated to create tables and figures to visualize how writing strategies
differ between sponsors and different modules.
The number of pages is calculated from the first page of the document to the last page
of the text body, this excludes the reference list and any appendices from the
calculation. The number of tables per document is considered specifically according

8

A drug that uses an innovative mechanism of action for treating a disease

9

A table is referred to as a table within the text paragraphs of the module 2 document body. Tables do not usually present
the full data from a statistical output table which is located either after the text sections (as tables, listings and figures), in
section 14 in CSRs or in a separate integrated analyses document

34

to the table of tables, in the same way that the number of figures is calculated according
to the table of figures.
The level-1 headings are the first-grade headings provided by the CTD ICH guidelines
(see Table 2), excluding conclusion, reference list and appendix. The analysis intends
to show whether sponsors follow the CTD structure for level-1 headings as well as
how reference lists and appendices are provided for each sponsor.
Headings grouped under the level-1 headings are called subheadings. The number of
CTD-specific subheadings has been calculated to estimate how much text these
subheadings contain. In addition, the number of pages that belong to the level-1
headings as per the CTD structure has been calculated to form a subheading-page
count ratio. This allows the analysis of how many subheadings are provided per
module for each document, how much text is provided per subheading and how
detailed the documents are.
Additionally, content repetition between tables and the text body was measured by
manually reviewing and categorizing the review results into self-set categories, which
are presented in more detail in Table 9. As this activity was shown to be quite timeconsuming, the analysis was only done for module 2.5 and 2.7.4 documents.

repetition is common in the documents. Notice that not all tables present data in
numerical form, but some tables present data as text. Both numerical and text data are
subject to the same categorizing system.

36

4.4 Discussion group
A discussion group of five experts was established to support the author throughout
the process. Deliberately a mixed group of senior experts, working in different
functions with different scientific backgrounds, was set up to allow wider competency
and lively discussions about the author’s findings. A monthly meeting was initiated to
ensure everyone stayed up-to-date throughout the whole process. Additional meetings
were arranged, and more experts were consulted as needed.

4.5 Coding of sponsors and packages
The goal of the research is to compare the set variables in an anonymous manner.
Therefore, the author has decided to create a coding system unique for this research
that allows the reader to differentiate between companies and their submitted drug
packages without revealing company information (Table 10). After all, this research
intends to focus on the industry rather than any specific sponsor.

The table above explains how each sponsor or company received an anonymous code
from A to J. The author has then created a relationship between each sponsor and its
chosen module 2 documents. For instance, sponsor A has two submission packages
that are to be evaluated, one from EMA (A-1) and one from HC (A-2). Each number
stands for one specific document. Note that due to lack of documents within the
research’s scope, both submission packages were exceptionally downloaded from HC
for sponsor J.

5 Results
The objectives of the thesis are described in section 3.2 and shortly below.
❖ To measure structural differences in 20 module 2 packages from 10 different
sponsors
❖ To measure data repetition between tables and paragraph text in module 2.5
and 2.7.4 documents
The above objectives will aid in evaluating suggestions for possible documentation
simplification.

5.1 Basic characteristics of the MAAs
Table 11. presents characteristics of the documents that can be found in the respective

portals for each MAA. These details were collected during the document download
and display the following information: indication, whether it is a first-in-class drug
(meaning a drug that uses an innovative mechanism of action for treating a disease) or
not, the year of document publication and the document type. The collected
information forms the baseline and allows to understand the similarities and
differences between the document packages at the start.
More than half of the documents (60%, 12/20) were oncology indications, documents
A-2 and D-1 presented RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) indication and six of the documents
(B-2, C-2, E-1, F-1, H-1 and H-2) were for a variety of indications. Of all the drugs,
35% (7/20) were categorized as first-in-class drugs. No MAA was published before
the year 2016 and most applications were published between 2018 and 2020. All
MAAs for EMA were subject to the "initial marketing authorization" procedure and
for Health Canada, "NDS" or "NDS-NAS" procedures.

The three following figures are presented below: number of pages (Figure 13), total
number of tables (Figure 14) and total number of figures (Figure 15). The x-axis presents
all publicly available modules and the y-axis presents the dependent variable (number
of pages, tables or figures). Each document is displayed with a specific color.

39

5.2 Number of pages
The number of pages for each module (Figure 13 and Table 12) varied between sponsors.
The shortest module 2.5 document (F-1) consisted of 26 pages, while the longest
document (A-2) was 145 pages. In other words, there was a 119 pages difference
between the module 2.5 document extremes. However, the majority of the documents
(95%, 19/20) had at least 47 pages and the mean was 79 pages and the median 80
pages.
There were fewer variations for module 2.7.1 documents and the number of pages was
59 or lower for all, except for one document (I-1) that had 105 pages. The shortest
document (E-2) had 3 pages, followed by a document (F-1) with 5 pages. The
difference between the module 2.7.1 document extremes was 102 pages. The majority
of the documents (70%, 14/20) had at least 20 pages and the mean number of pages
was 35 and the median 29 pages.
In module 2.7.2 documents, the longest document (J-1) had 195 pages, whilst the
shortest document (F-1) had 12 pages. There was an increased difference between the
module 2.7.2 document extremes, 183 pages, but 50% (10/20) of the documents had
100 pages or more. The mean number of pages was 101 and the median 100.
In module 2.7.3 documents, the longest document (A-2) had 210 pages and the shortest
document (F-1) contained 15 pages. The difference between the module 2.7.3
document extremes increased further, reaching 195 pages. However, 45% (9/20) of the
documents had at least 100 pages. The mean number of pages was 100 and the median
93.
The documents with peak number of pages were found in module 2.7.4 documents
where two documents exceeded 400 pages, being 406 (A-2) and 407 (D-1) pages long.
The shortest document (F-1) contained 12 pages. The largest difference between the
extremes, 395 pages, was found

in module 2.7.4 documents. Of all the 2.7.4

documents, 40% (8/20) amounted to at least 200 pages. The mean was 178 pages and
the median 185 pages.
The longest document for the total clinical summary document, meaning module 2.7.1,
2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4 combined, contained 792 pages, while the shortest document was 44
40

pages long. The difference between the extremes was 748 pages. Of the total clinical
summary documents, 45% (9/20) had more than 400 pages.

Table 12 shows that module 2.7.1 documents contained the lowest number of pages for

all descriptive statistics (mean, median, max and min). The trend was followed by
module 2.5 documents, except for the minimum number of pages, which was the
highest of all the modules. The statistical values were similar between module 2.7.2
and 2.7.3, and module 2.7.4 documents had the highest statistical values for all, except
for the minimum number of pages.

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from
the different sponsors?

A relationship between the length of a document and the different modules could be
observed. For example, document A-2 (RA indication) and J-1 (oncology indication)
had a greater number of pages and stayed above average in every module, whilst
document E-2 (oncology indication) maintained a lower page count for all modules.
Some exceptions were observed in the collected data. Document F-1, written for
infection prophylaxis, and H-2, written for haemophilia, had exceptionally short
documents in every module. Document F-1 did not exceed 30 pages for any module
and H-2 also stayed well below average for all modules and had no document for
module 2.7.1. However, sponsor H and F did not show a similar trend for documents
H-1 and F-2, hence, a sponsor-specific approach to have shorter documents was not
spotted and the indication might have affected the length of the document. Document
A-2 and D-1 had especially long documents in module 2.7.4, the only documents for
RA indication. Though, as this was an initial analysis, there is no possibility to draw a
conclusion between indications and document structure. As the number of analyzed
documents are especially short, it is believed that this finding was based on a
coincidence.

43

It was apparent from a few documents that the sponsors had applied a marketing
authorization for their product with a lower than average number of pages, however,
this was not sponsor-specific as one sponsor could have submitted one short and one
long document.
5.2.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

It is mentioned in the CTD guideline that the module 2.5 clinical overview documents
should include around 30 pages, but this might vary depending on the complexity of
the application. The data collected for the clinical overview documents showed that
only one document (F-1) abided by the recommended number of pages, whereas the
rest of the documents (95%, 19/20) exceeded the recommendation. In other words,
most sponsors did not follow the recommended document length of 30 pages.
According to the CTD guideline, the target length of the total clinical summary
document 2.7 (modules 2.7.1 to 2.7.4 combined) ranges from 50 to 400 pages. The
CTD guideline for the recommended length was not followed as the length of the
module 2.7 documents was exceeded by 45% (9/20) of the documents.
The CTD guideline encourages to minimize the length by including graphs and tables
in the text body. Additionally, it is not recommended to repeat material in the module
2.5 clinical overview that has been mentioned elsewhere, hence, cross-referencing is a
preferred solution (EMA, 2004). Cross-references into module 2.7 and module 5
would be the most beneficial approach for module 2.5 to avoid unnecessary repetition
and reduce the document length. Cross-referencing into module 5, whenever
applicable, could decrease the length of module 2.7 documents. Furthermore,
electronic CTD admits the generation of active cross-references, and this allows easy
access to the referenced data with one click.

44

5.3 Number of tables
The total number of tables (Figure 14 and Table 13) showed a growing trend from
module 2.5 to module 2.7.4 documents.
For module 2.5 documents, the lowest number of tables was 4 tables (F-1), while the
document with most tables had 33 (G-2). The difference between sponsor extremes
was 29 tables. The mean was 14 tables and the median 12 tables.
For module 2.7.1 documents the highest number of tables was 46 (I-1) and the lowest
was 0 (E-2), and the difference between the sponsor extremes was 46 tables. The mean
and median number of tables was 15 for both. Document H-2 did not include any
document for module 2.7.1.
For module 2.7.2 documents, the maximum number of tables was 68 (J-1) and the
minimum 2 (F-1). The difference between sponsor extremes was 66 tables. The mean
was 29 tables and the median 26 tables.
The highest number of tables for module 2.7.3 documents was 71 (J-2) and the lowest
was 2 (F-1). The difference between sponsor extremes was 69 tables. However, out of
all the modules, module 2.7.3 documents fluctuated the least between the sponsors
and, for most documents (60%, 12/20), the number of tables stayed between 10 and
30. Module 2.7.3 documents had a mean of 30 tables and the median was 26 tables.
The most extensive variations were seen in module 2.7.4 documents where the largest
number of tables was 145 (A-2) and the lowest was 1 table (F-1). The difference
between the extremes was 144 tables. However, 85% (17/20) of the documents had 80
or fewer tables. The mean was 59 tables and the median 60 tables.

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from
the different sponsors?

For the majority of sponsors, the number of tables was growing, from module 2.5
towards module 2.7.4 documents (Figure 14). Three documents (A-2, H-1 and I-1) had
a greater number of tables in at least one of the modules, which clearly correlated with
the total page count of the specific document. For example, A-2 had 145 tables (highest
digit for the module) and 406 pages (highest digit was 407) in the module 2.7.4
document, H-1 had 62 tables and 145 pages in the module 2.7.3 document and I-1 had
46 tables and 105 pages in the module 2.7.1 document. However, this was not true for
all documents, for example, C-2 had 120 tables for the module 2.7.4 document (the
second highest digit of all module 2.7.4 documents) but only 230 pages (the maximum
number of pages for module 2.7.4 was 407 pages).
Some exceptions were observed in the collected data. Documents of F-1 had an
exceptionally low number of tables in every module and document A-2 had an
exceptionally high number of tables in module 2.7.4. Document of E-2 did not present
any tables in module 2.7.1.
5.3.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

Per the CTD guideline, tables are always preferred in the content if it can improve the
readability of the document, but it is up to the sponsor to decide when information and
47

results should be presented as tables, figures or text. This is a quite vague statement,
which has resulted in different interpretations, as shown by the collected data in Figure
14 and Figure 15.

The lowest number of tables stayed similar between every module (between 0 and 4),
whilst the maximum number of tables increased consecutively from module 2.7.1 to
2.7.4 documents (from 46 to 145 tables). The module 2.5 documents, which are
supposed to be short clinical overview documents, had the lowest number of tables
(maximum 33 tables). The requested content for module 2.7.1 documents is also fewer,
hence, the number of descriptive tables should be few. On the other hand, the
recommended content for module 2.7.4 documents is extensive and should contain
more detailed descriptions., thus, more tables are to be provided in this document. This
was true for all modules of the collected data. However, as the documents exceeded
the recommended page length for both modules (2.5 and 2.7), it could be discussed
whether all provided tables are essential.

48

5.4 Number of figures
For the total number of figures (Figure 15 and Table 14) no clear trend between the
modules was shown. In module 2.5, two documents (E-1 and F-1) did not include any
figures and the largest number of figures was 21 for document D-2. The difference
between the sponsor extremes was 21 figures. The mean for the number of figures was
9 and the median was 8.
In module 2.7.1 no figures were presented in six of the documents (C-2, E-1, E-2, F1, G-1 and H-1). H-2 did not contain any document for module 2.7.1, hence, no figures
were presented for this document. The highest number of figures was 16 and was
recorded in document I-1. The difference between the sponsor extremes was 16
figures. The mean and median were 6 figures for both.
The documents in module 2.7.2 contained the most figures, up to 52 (B-2 and H-1),
yet one document (F-1) did not include any figures. Module 2.7.2 documents also
showed the largest fluctuation between sponsors and the difference between them was
52 figures. The mean was 25 figures and the median was 21 figures.
Module 2.7.3 and 2.7.4 had a maximum of 38 and 44 figures in their documents, with
a considerably lower mean of 16 and 10 figures, respectively. In addition, one
document (F-1) for module 2.7.3 and four documents (C-2, E-2, F-1 and I-1) for
module 2.7.4 contained no figures.

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from the
different sponsors?

As presented in Figure 15, a large fluctuation in number of figures between both sponsors
and the modules was noticed. The most infrequent use of figures was shown in the module
2.7.2 and 2.7.4 documents. The infrequency in module 2.7.2 is unclear but might depend
on how the sponsor chooses to present PK data (in figures or tables). For module 2.7.4
documents, 75% (15/20) presented 10 or fewer figures. The remaining five documents (A2, D-1, F-1, H-1 and J-1) presented a greater number of figures (between 20 and 44) and,
in addition, these documents were long with number of pages ranging from 197 to 407.
Another reason for the infrequent use of number of figures in module 2.7.4 might be the
large difference between the total page count extremes (395 pages).
Some exceptions were also observed in the collected data. There were large variations
between a single document for different modules. Some documents had reached the
average number of figures for certain modules, while only a few or no figures at all were
included in other modules. It was observed that some documents (e.g., A-2, H-1) had
implemented more figures in all the modules, compared to other documents (H-2 and J2). Document F-1 did not include figures for any module and, as shown earlier, the same
document also had fewer pages and tables. The reason for this might be that even though
it is an initial marketing authorization product, the active substance itself is known from
before and, therefore, the information presented in the documents are reduced as enough
data are already available.
51

5.4.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

As stated earlier, figures are always preferred in the content if it can improve the
readability of the document, but it is up to the sponsor to decide when information and
results should be presented as figures.
For the total number of figures in the documents, it is shown that there is no clear guidance
on how often figures should be used. As mentioned above, PK data, which present
measurements concerning the concentration and duration of the drug in the blood, is found
in module 2.7.2 documents. These parameters can describe bioavailability, metabolism,
duration, distribution and excretion, and the data are often better presented as figures
rather than tables.

52

5.5 Level-1 headings
The following five tables (Table 15 to Table 19) were created to examine whether the
sponsors followed the recommended CTD standards for all level-1 headings for the
publicly available module 2 documents and if any structural difference appeared between
sponsors. Another topic evaluated was how reference lists and appendices are provided in
the documents by each sponsor. The detailed information of the module structures and
level-1 heading naming can be found in section 2.1, Table 2.
The first column for each table shows the sponsors and their specific document, and the
second column describes whether an executive summary was included in the beginning
of the document. The executive summary is a short overview of what will follow in the
text body. The following columns after the executive summary display the level-1
headings that vary in number depending on the given module (2.5, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3 or
2.7.4). Any additional level-1 headings (meaning level-1 headings that are not CTD
recommended) are sponsor-specific 10 and mentioned in a column of their own. The
conclusion, reference list and appendix are mentioned in the tables as separate level-1
headings if applicable.
Table 15 shows the structure of the clinical overview module 2.5 document. An executive

summary was included in eight (40%) clinical overview documents. All but two (E-1 and
E-2) evaluated module 2.5 documents followed the CTD structure for the level-1
headings; 2.5.1 Product development rationale, 2.5.2 Overview of biopharmaceuticals,
2.5.3 Overview of clinical pharmacology, 2.5.4 Overview of efficacy, 2.5.5 Overview of
safety, and 2.5.6 Benefits and risks conclusions. Document E-1 did not include a 2.5.2
level-1 heading and document E-2 had a different order of the level-1 headings than what
is recommended by the CTD. Document E-1 and E-2 were from the same sponsors and
were written for antiviral and oncology indications, respectively. One document (G-1) had
an additional level-1 heading, describing data in the context of historical clinical trials and

10

Sponsor-specific is referred to as a trend that is specified for a specific sponsor and its two documents (document X-1 and X-2),
meaning a trend that is seen in one sponsor might vary greatly from what is seen in another sponsor. Not sponsor-specific means,
therefore, that a trend that is seen in one document from a specific sponsor, does not necessarily have to be observed in another
document from the same sponsor

real-world data. All sponsors (100%) presented a reference list and three documents (15%) included extra data in the form of a
separate appendix.

Table 16, which shows the structure of the module 2.7.1 documents, displays an executive

summary in five (25%) module 2.7.1 documents. The majority (80%, 16/20) of the
documents followed the CTD structure for the level-1 headings; 2.7.1.1 Background and
overview, 2.7.1.2 Summary of results of individual studies, and 2.7.1.3 Comparison and
analyses of results across studies. However, document E-1 did not include the level-1
heading 2.7.1.2. The same sponsor for document E-2 had a different structure compared
to a typical 2.7.1 document, hence, the document could not be compared to the other
documents. The level-1 heading 2.7.1.3 of document B-1 was worded differently
(Analytical methods) than in the CTD guideline. Document A-2 included two additional
level-1 headings in the document, describing extended-release claim, and in vitro and in
vivo correlation. A reference list was included in nine documents (45%) and a conclusion
was included in five documents (25%). Majority of the documents (65%, 13/20) included
extra data in the form of an appendix that was either included in the document or as a
separate file.

Table 17 displays the structure of module 2.7.2 documents. An executive summary was

included in four (20%) documents. All documents followed the CTD structure for the
level-1 headings; 2.7.2.1 Background and overview, 2.7.2.2 Summary of results of
individual studies, and 2.7.2.3 Comparison and analyses of results across studies, whilst
the level-1 heading 2.7.2.4 Special studies was only included in 35% (7/20) of the
documents. In 12 of the documents the level-1 heading 2.7.2.4 was either not included
(15%, 3/20) or included with no information provided (45%, 9/20). In addition, the level1 heading 2.7.2.4 for document E-1 was titled differently (virology summary) when
compared to the CTD standard, and document E-2 was the only document that had
included an additional level-1 heading 2.7.2.5, describing summary of key findings. A
reference list was included in 12 module 2.7.2 documents (60%) and a conclusion in four
documents (20%). Majority of the documents (70%, 14/20) included extra data in the form
of an appendix that was either included in the document or as a separate file.

Table 18 shows the structure of module 2.7.3 documents. An executive summary was

included in six (30%) documents. All documents followed the CTD structure for the level1 headings; 2.7.3.1 Background and overview of clinical efficacy, 2.7.3.2 Summary of
results of individual studies, 2.7.3.3 Comparison and analyses of results across studies,
2.7.3.4 Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations, and 2.7.3.5
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects. Two documents (10%, document F-2 and
G-1) worded the level-1 heading 2.7.3.2 differently (Summary of results for study X and
Summary of results of individual drug Y monotherapy studies) when compared to the
CTD guideline. Three documents (15%) included one or several additional level-1
headings, describing efficacy conclusions, drug combination studies, studies of specific
diseases and single patient protocols. A reference list and conclusion were included in
60% (12/20) and 35% (7/20) of the documents, respectively. Majority of the documents
(75%, 15/20) included extra data in the form of an appendix that was either included in

Table 19 shows the structure of module 2.7.4 documents. An executive summary was

included in eight (40%) documents. Sixteen documents (80%) followed the CTD structure
for the level-1 headings; 2.7.4.1 Exposure to the drug, 2.7.4.2 Adverse events, 2.7.4.3
Clinical laboratory evaluations, 2.7.4.4 Vital signs, physical findings, and other
observations related to safety, and 2.7.4.5 Safety in special groups and situations, whilst
only 5 documents (25%) included information for the level-1 heading 2.7.4.6 Postmarketing data. Document F-2 mentioned the level-1 heading 2.7.4.2 as a subheading of
the level-1 heading 2.7.4.1, and level-1 headings 2.7.4.3 and 2.7.4.4 were mentioned as
subheadings of an additional level-1 heading (not in accordance with the CTD), therefore,
only two level-1 headings from the CTD guideline were referred to in the F-2 document.
A similar exception was seen for document C-2, where the level-1 heading 2.7.4.6 was
mentioned as a subheading of level-1 heading 2.7.4.5. Document I-2 worded the level-1
heading 2.7.4.1 differently (Exposure to drug Z) than the CTD. Document D-2 could not
be compared to the other documents since it included several studies and had an alternative
structure. Two documents (10%) included additional level-1 headings, describing
background

and overview,

summaries,

subject

disposition,

study population

demographics and baseline characteristics, correlative analysis pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic outcomes, additional safety studies and narratives. A reference list and
conclusion were included in 60% (12/20) and 35% (7/20) of the documents, respectively.
Majority of the documents (70%, 14/20) included extra data in the form of an appendix
that was either included in the document or as a separate file.

- = Not mentioned; Yes = The section was provided; Provided separately = Not found in the same document; No info = The
section was provided but no information was applicable or available; Different title = The section was mentioned with
different words than in accordance to the CTD standard;
* section 2.7.4.2, 2.7.4.3, 2.7.4.4 are mentioned as subheadings and are included in other level-1 headings in the
document. Only two level-1 headings of the CTD guidelines were mentioned in the document according to the standards.

5.5.1

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from the
different sponsors?

The level-1 headings had multiple variations, however, no document was incorrectly
structured as the guidance is only a recommendation. This is another example that shows
that recommendations will create differences in the documentation process between
different sponsors.
An executive summary was included in 31% (31/100) of the documents, but this was not
a sponsor-specific action, meaning that a sponsor that had included the executive summary
in one document may not have included it in all other documents. Module 2.5 clinical
overview and module 2.7.4 safety summary documents had included an executive
summary more often (40% for both module 2.5 and 2.7.4) than other documents (25% for
module 2.7.1, 20% for module 2.7.2 and 30% for module 2.7.3). The executive summary
was described as a short overview of the document, though, not always mentioned with
the specific wording "executive summary", but could be mentioned as "summary of
clinical pharmacology/summary of biopharmaceutic studies and analytical methods/
summary of clinical pharmacology studies" and so forth, depending on the document
module.
The numbering of the level-1 headings differed between sponsors and, for example, the
first appearing level-1 heading was either numbered as "2.5.1" or as "1", depending on the
sponsor. Sponsors B, C, E, F, G, H and J numbered according to the latter. The approach
chosen was sponsor-specific, meaning all module 2 documents from one sponsor used the
same numbering style.
In one document (1%, 1/100), the order of the level-1 headings was presented differently
and in five (5%, 5/100) of the documents the heading wording was not identical to the
CTD wording but was modified to fit the presented content.

63

Altogether, five sponsors included one or multiple additional level-1 headings. Document
A-2 included two extra level-1 headings in module 2.7.2, document F-2 included three
extra level-1 headings in module 2.7.4 and document J-2 included three extra level-1
headings in module 2.7.3. Document G-1 included one extra level-1 heading in module
2.5 and one in module 2.7.3. Sponsor E-2 included one extra level-1 heading in module
2.7.1 and module 2.7.3, and seven extra level-1 headings in module 2.7.4. The inclusion
of additional level-1 headings was not a sponsor-specific action. The added level-1
headings were not necessarily included in the end of the document but in-between the
standard CTD level-1 headings, which resulted in numbering changes of the headings.
The additional level-1 headings did not have a relationship with the total page count of
the specific document, i.e., it did not indicate that the total number of pages was higher
than average or closer to the highest page count for the documents where the additional
level-1 headings were found.
If no data were found for a specific level-1 heading, the section was either mentioned and
then followed by the text "not applicable" or "no available information", or completely
removed from the document. These were sponsor-specific approaches.
The reference list was included in the end of the module 2.5 documents for all sponsors.
For the 2.7 summary documents (modules 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4), the reference list was
not always included as a separate level-1 heading but included in the appendix as a
subheading. The inclusion and location of a reference list in a specific document was
sponsor-specific for 9 out of 10 sponsors. Sponsors B, E, G, H, I, J and document F-1
included reference lists in at least one of the module 2.7 documents (2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3,
2.7.4). Sponsors A, C, D and document F-2 did not include a reference list in any of the
module 2.7 documents.
Documents D-2, E-2 and H-2 had specific exceptions for certain modules. In module
2.7.1, the E-2 document did not follow the same structure as the other module 2.7.1
documents, while document H-2 did not provide any document for the same module. In
module 2.7.4, document D-2 included many different studies that made a comparison with
the other documents impossible. These exceptions are further reflected in the subheading
figures (section 5.6).
64

5.5.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

An executive summary provides a short introduction to the rest of the document, however,
it is not according to the CTD standard and does not have to be included in the documents.
The CTD guideline provides recommendations on how to structure, number and name the
level-1 headings in the table of contents. The following structure was recommended for
numbering the level-1 headings: 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3…" for clinical overview and "2.7.1.1,
2.7.2.2 …" for summary documents, and so forth. The recommendation was followed by
three (30%, 3/10) sponsors. The other sponsors used a single digit numbering system "1,
2, 3, 4…" for all documents. The deviation from the CTD structure is not incorrect and
the heading numbering as 1, 2, 3 … follows simple logic and was accepted by the health
authorities. Arabic numbers are to be used in accordance with the CTD guideline and this
recommendation was followed by all sponsors for both the level-1 heading and
subheading numbering. The CTD recommended structure was followed by 99% (99/100)
of the documents.
The CTD guideline states that one reference list should be provided for module 2.5
documents and one should be included for the total clinical summary document 2.7
(meaning all module 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3, 2.7.4 combined). The reference list for the total
clinical summary document 2.7 can also be presented as a separate section (2.7.5) after
the total clinical summary document, meaning that no reference list must be provided
within the summary documents if a separate section is provided. The reference lists were
only analyzed for those documents that had provided the references within the individual
documents. A reference list provided as a separate section (2.7.5) was not analyzed. As
sponsors A, C, D and document F-2 did not provide any reference list in any of the
summary documents (module 2.7) it can be assumed that a separate reference list (2.7.5)
was provided. A variation was shown in how reference lists were included for the different
clinical summary documents. While one reference list was mentioned in one document, it
was left out in another, i.e., a sponsor did not necessarily follow the same approach for all
summary documents.

65

Conclusions were sometimes included as a level-1 heading, however, nothing is specified
about including a conclusion as a level-1 heading in the CTD guideline. The only specific
level-1 heading mentioning a conclusion is the "benefit and risk conclusion" heading in
module 2.5.
According to CTD, an appendix should be included at the end of a document if there are
any detailed presentations of methods and results. Lengthy tables should also be provided
in the appendix. An appendix should be placed after a specific module (2.5, 2.7.1, 2.7.2
…). It is also specified in module 2.5 section 2.5.6 that an additional appendix (section
2.5.6.5) can be included if a detailed presentation of the summarized section 2.5.6.4
(benefit-risk assessment) is necessary. Some sponsors have also included an appendix as
a separate document, an approach that is not mentioned in the CTD recommendations.

66

5.6 Subheadings
Figure 16 to Figure 20 were created to show the total number of subheadings in relation to

the number of pages in the text body. Only the subheadings that belong to the level-1
headings, as established in the level-1 heading tables above, were calculated. In addition,
the number of pages that belong to the level-1 headings as per the CTD structure has been
calculated to form a subheading versus page count ratio. The level-1 headings according
to the CTD structure are those presented in section 2.1, Table 2. This allows the analysis
of how much text is provided per subheading and how detailed the documents are.
The presentation of this data will merely focus on the subheading to page count ratio, and
not on the document length as this has been brought up in section 5.2.
In figures 16 to 20, the y-axis shows both the number of subheadings and the number of
pages. The x-axis presents the specific sponsors and documents. The blue bars show the
total number of subheadings for the level-1 headings in the document, and the orange bars
show the total page count for the level-1 headings.
The ratio between the blue and orange bars are interpreted so that when the number of
pages is higher than the number of subheadings it implies that one subheading has a
content length over one page. Similarly, a higher number of subheadings compared to the
number of pages indicates that there is less than one page of content per subheading.

67

Figure 16 shows the module 2.5 documents. It was observed that the sponsors are to some extent aligned when investigating the

relationship between subheadings and the number of pages. The number of subheadings was close to the number of pages for
40% (8/20) of the sponsors. Sponsor A showed greater difference in subheading versus number of pages, ratio 2.8 and 2.1 for
document A-1 and A-2, respectively (meaning that 2.8 and 2.1 number of pages was the average content amount per
subheading), compared to other sponsors.

Figure 17 shows that a clear trend is followed in the module 2.7.1 documents. For the majority (70%, 14/20) of the documents,

it was distinguished that the number of pages were expressed in higher quantity than the number of subheadings. This trend was
module-specific 11 rather than sponsor-specific. Document I-1 had a 3.3 ratio and contained the highest number of pages.
Document C-1 and G-2 had more subheadings than number of pages and both presented a 0.8 ratio. No subheading data were
available for document E-2 as the document followed an unusual 2.7.1 structure. In addition, document H-2 did not contain a
2.7.1 document.

Module-specific is referred to as a trend that is specified for a specific module, meaning a trend that is seen in one module should be followed to a great extent by another sponsor in
the same module

69

Figure 18 shows that module 2.7.2 documents followed the same trend as in Figure 17, but the number of pages varied more
between the sponsors than the number of subheadings. This trend also appeared to be module-specific rather than sponsorspecific. Sponsor G (ratio 0.8) and document C-1 (ratio 0.9) were clear exceptions in that and, in this occasion, they appeared
to favor a greater number of subheadings in relation to the number of pages. Some documents (e.g., E-1, I-1, J-1) had a ratio 5
between the number of pages and number of subheadings, i.e., reaching up to 5 pages of content per subheading.

documents (85%, 17/20), the total number of pages was expressed in a higher quantity than the number of subheadings.
Document A-2 had the largest ratio (5.8) difference between the number of pages and number of subheadings. Visible exceptions
were observed continuously for sponsor G (ratio 0.8 and 0.9, respectively) and also document H-2 (ratio 0.8).

In Figure 20, it was observed that half of the sponsors (50%, 5/10) for the module 2.7.4 documents followed a sponsor-specific
approach when investigating the ratio between subheadings and the number of pages. For the majority of documents (75%,
15/20), the total number of pages is displayed in a higher granularity than the number of subheadings, however, this was not
the trend for sponsor G (ratio 0.7 and 1.1) and document F-1 (ratio 0.6) and H-2 (ratio 0.8). Document A-2 continued to have
the largest ratio (3.4) difference between the number of pages and number of subheadings. No data were compiled for document
D-2 since the document contained many different studies and could not be compared to the other documents.

5.6.1

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from the
different sponsors?

The different modules tended towards higher number of pages in relation to the number
of subheadings, i.e., one subheading had a content length over one page. An exception
was module 2.5 where the number of pages and number of subheadings was near equal,
i.e., one page of content per subheading. Some trends were aligned through all sponsors
(e.g., the quantity of subheadings and page count) and some tendencies appeared to be
sponsor-specific (e.g., the ratio between these variables).
Sponsor G appeared to slightly favor a greater number of subheadings in relation to the
number of pages for all documents regardless of the module, which indicates documents
with short subsections and several subheadings per page. Sponsor A had long documents
structured with few subheadings and this was true for both document A-1 and A-2. Other
sponsors had a tendency to include more subheadings which created documents with
shorter content description per subheading. Sponsor I followed the same trend but the
difference between number of pages and number of subheadings was not as significant for
all modules as was shown for sponsor A.
5.6.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

The results showed that sponsors tend to structure the content by including subsections in
a higher number than what is mentioned in the CTD guideline.
The module 2.5 document has only seven subheadings mentioned in the CTD structure
within the level-1 heading 2.5.6 (2.5.6.1, 2.5.6.1.1, 2.5.6.1.2, 2.5.6.2, 2.5.6.3, 2.5.6.4,
2.5.6.5). According to Figure 16, all documents (100%) contained 21 or more subheadings.
The CTD does not include recommendations for subheading grouping for module 2.7.1
or 2.7.2, but the majority of the module 2.7.1 documents (80%) and module 2.7.2
documents (95%) contained 10 or more subheadings. However, there are other
recommendations based on the number of summarized studies and how these should be
structured, which will result in more content.

73

The module 2.7.3 documents have three subheadings mentioned in the CTD structure
within the level-1 heading 2.7.3.3 (2.7.3.3.1, 2.7.3.3.2, 2.7.3.3.3). According to Figure 19,
one document (F-1) included three subheadings, whilst the rest of the documents included
10 or more subheadings. The greatest number of subheadings was 105 in document H-2.
In other words, only one document (F-1) had followed the guidance on how many
subheadings to include in module 2.7.3 documents.
The level-1 heading 2.7.4.1 for the module 2.7.4 document is recommended to be
structured in three subheadings (2.7.4.1.1, 2.7.4.1.2, 2.7.4.1.3) and level-1 heading 2.7.4.2
is recommended to be structured further by two subheadings (2.7.4.2.1, 2.7.4.2.2). In
addition, level-1 heading 2.7.4.5 is recommended to be structured further by eight
subheadings (2.7.4.5.1, 2.7.4.5.2, 2.7.4.5.3, 2.7.4.5.4, 2.7.4.5.5, 2.7.4.5.6, 2.7.4.5.7,
2.7.4.5.8). In other words, 13 subheadings in total are recommended to be included in the
module 2.7.4 document. All (100%, 19/19) of the documents had included more than 13
subheadings in module 2.7.4, hence, no sponsor followed the recommended guidance.
Document D-2 was not included in the calculations, as the document included several
studies and could, therefore, not be compared to the other documents.

74

5.7 Repetition of table data in the text
Figure 21 and Figure 22 show the repetition of table content in the text across different

sponsors in module 2.5 and 2.7.4 documents. The left y-axis of the figures presents the
number of tables for each document and the right y-axis presents the number of pages.
The x-axis presents a specific sponsor and document. Note the scale variance of the y-axis
for the respective tables.
The data are based on four colored categories:
Category 1. Data from table is not repeated in text
Category 2. Data from table is summarized in text
Category 3. Data from table is somewhat repeated in text
Category 4. Data from table is (almost) completely repeated in text
Please visit section 4.3 and Table 9 for a detailed explanation of the categories.
Figure 21 shows a sponsor-specific variation between the data repetition categories in the

reviewed module 2.5 documents. In all documents, table data are repeated in the text to
some extent. Category 1, 2 and 3 repetition was seen in all 20 module 2.5 documents. In
15 of the documents, more than 75% (15/20) of all tables in each document fell under
category 1 or 2. The rest of the tables in the module 2.5 documents fell under category 3,
except for six documents (30%) that had one or two tables in category 4. Document C-2,
D-2, E-1, E-2 and I-1 had one table in category 4, while document F-2 had two tables. The
use of category 4 was document-specific rather than sponsor-specific. Half of the
documents that presented category 4 tables (3/6, 50%) had 100 or more pages in their
documents.

Figure 22 shows the table data repetition levels in the module 2.7.4 documents. The most frequently seen category was 3, which

was present in all documents, except document F-1, and appeared as the average category for 80% (16/20) of all the documents.
Category 2 was present in 90% (18/20) of the documents but only as the average category for 10% (2/20). Category 1 was
applied in 95% (19/20) of the documents but was only the average category for 10% of all the documents. Category 4 was
applied in one or two tables for 45% (9/20) of the documents. Documents A-1, E-1, F-2, I-1 and J-1 had one table in
category 4, while documents C-1, D-2 and E-2 had two tables. Document A-2 and D-1 presented documents with higher number
of pages. A-2 presented all four table categories whilst the majority (61/77, 79%) of the D-1 tables where in category 1 and 2.
In other words, table with less repetition did not indicate a shorter document.

5.7.1

What were the structural differences in the 20 module 2 packages from the
different sponsors?

Repetition occurred in all documents for module 2.5 and 2.7.4, and variation existed
between sponsors regarding the level of repetition of table content in the text. It was visible
that a few sponsors were aiming to prepare their documents with less table content
repetition, however, the differences were minor and could depend on unknown factors.
For example, sponsor D aimed for less repetition in both documents for module 2.5, one
document being for an oncology indication and the other for an RA indication. In module
2.7.4, the trend was not as evident for sponsor D, compared to the other sponsors.
Category 1 was often presented in a higher ratio in module 2.5 compared to module 2.7.4
documents. Category 2 was favored in module 2.5, while category 3 was preferred in
module 2.7.4 documents. Category 4 was not considered as an ideal approach by any
sponsor in the evaluated modules. Individual differences were identified within a sponsor,
meaning a category ratio for one sponsor in one document did not necessarily reflect the
same category ratio for another document of the same sponsor.
Both the number of tables and the table content repetitions had an impact on the document
length, as expected. The correlation between the document length and number of tables is
described in section 5.3.1. It is mentioned that the document length increased with a
growing number of tables. The correlation between a table category and the document
length was similar to the correlation between the document length and number of tables,
but there were also documents (D-1 and A-2) that were long although the majority of
tables were obtained in the lower repetition categories (category 1 and 2).
The research project did not measure the repetition of plain text between different
document sections or any other type of repetition that might occur in a document. This
kind of repetition might have a great impact on the document length.
The author leaves room for misinterpretation of the tables, as they were categorized
personally by the author, with one pair of eyes alone, and wants to highlight the
importance of this approach only being a base to understand differences between sponsors
and documents with regards to repetition of table data in the text.

79

5.7.2

How well is the CTD guideline followed?

According to the CTD guideline, the module 2.5 clinical overview should not contain
repetition of content that is fully presented elsewhere. It should also be a short document
including tables and graphs to aid understanding and to establish rapid reading. There are
no specific recommendations on how to repeat data from tables in the text. Module 2.7.4
documents contain more detailed descriptions and more repetition of table data in the text
is expected, than for module 2.5 documents. This was also true, as shown by the collected
data from the module 2.5 and 2.7.4 documents. Cross-referencing from module 2.5 to
module 2.7 and module 5 would be beneficial to avoid unnecessary repetition. Similarly,
would cross-referencing from module 2.7.4 to module 5 be advantageous.

6 Discussion
Today, when a drug is granted marketing authorization, it is important to remember that
the documentation process of the drug does not end there. For example, the marketing
authorization is followed by a redaction and anonymization process of certain MAA
documents that will be made publicly available. Information will be exposed to the public
and the parts that are to be published will continuously change and grow during the
upcoming years. Therefore, it is essential to understand how to structure the documents
and what information to include to ensure that both the authorities and the public are
satisfied. For example, confidential information and individual patient data must stay
protected throughout the whole process.
The strategy of presenting information in a report focuses mainly on the clinical trial
endpoints, which will determine whether the drug is beneficial enough to be used in real
life. This is the vital information that in the end will approve or reject a drug’s marketing
authorization. If we go back 10 years in time, the main focus of the process was to prove
the success of the drug by including as much information as possible, a tactic that now
must be restructured. The process has become more transparent and it is important that
the sponsor creates writing strategies that take these changes into consideration. Instead
of only focusing on proving the benefit of a drug, the writing strategy should start by
focusing on what is necessary to grant a market approval overall, i.e., how much content
is needed for a successful marketing authorization.

6.1 The CTD guideline
In general, the CTD guideline was well followed by all the sponsors. The level-1 headings
and subheadings mentioned in CTD were all included in the documents. The inclusion of
tables and figures were also followed, and the CTD guideline has limited description for
how these should be used. The one CTD recommendation that was not followed was the
document length. Therefore, the simplifications suggestions (see section 6.3) are examples
of possible ways to shorten the document.

82

The CTD only provides recommendations for the sponsors on how to write and structure
their documents. All recommendations emphasize the importance of a clear and easy-toread document, which is a vague statement that leads to document variations and variation
in the amount of presented information between different sponsors. The understanding of
what a clear and easy-to-read document is varies between sponsors, or even between
different study teams as part of the same sponsor. The data collected in this thesis show
that writing strategies differs between sponsors and that the CTD recommendations are
interpreted differently.
In general, it was expected that the total clinical 2.7 document would be larger than the
module 2.5 clinical overview document, which was true for the collected results. What
was not expected was that 95% of the module 2.5 documents had reached a total page
count that was exceeding the 30-page CTD recommendation. Moreover, six documents
had a total number of pages that measured threefold the CTD recommendation, i.e., 90 or
more pages. For the total clinical 2.7 documents, 45% exceeded the 400-page CTD
recommendation. In addition, one 2.7 document reached almost 800 pages, meaning the
number of pages was almost twofold to what CTD recommends.
According to the CTD, module 2.7.1 should contain biopharmaceutic studies and
associated analytical methods. This is the shortest document when the CTD content is
compared to other module 2.7 documents. This was also true for the collected results. In
accordance with the CTD, module 2.7.1 documents are only recommended to contain 3
level-1 headings and no subheadings (see section 5.5 and 5.6). A recommendation that
was not followed. In addition, according to the CTD, it is expected that this document
would have the fewest number of tables, which was true for the collected data.
Module 2.7.4 documents contain drug safety data and it was expected not only to be the
longest document but also to provide the greatest number of tables, compared to other
module 2.7 documents. This was true for the collected data. The CTD recommendation
contains 6 level-1 headings and 15 subheadings for module 2.7.4. The safety in module
2.7.4 document is described in a detailed manner and tables are included to clarify the
outcome. Detailed safety data can be, for instance, descriptions of serious adverse events,
pregnancies, deaths or drug discontinuations due to an adverse event. In addition, safety
83

is divided into different sub-topics, for example, lab value measurements, extent of
exposure and safety in special patient groups. These are all data that allow for extensive
reporting.
From a writing point of view, there might be several reasons why the module 2.5 and 2.7
documents exceeded the recommended page length. For module 2.5 documents it might
be due to the relatively new version of the CTD guidance (M4E R2). The new version
demands an increase of the benefit-risk content, i.e., more repetition and expansion of the
section is required, which causes the original 30-page recommendation to be rather
outdated. A reason why the module 2.7 documents exceeded the page number
recommendations could be because it is rather difficult to create a brief document that
must contain enough information to show efficacy and safety of a drug.
A follow up question would be whether the guidance should be updated as only a few
sponsors are following the 30-page and 50- to 400-page recommendation or should all
sponsors reconsider how to present data in the module 2.5 and 2.7 documents to reduce
and reach the preferred number of pages?
The number of tables followed the same trend as the number of pages for each module.
The number of tables was lowest for the module 2.5 documents and increased
continuously from module 2.7.1 to 2.7.4. The number of pages did not necessarily increase
because of the high number of tables, however, the results showed that several of the
documents with the greatest number of pages also contained the greatest number of tables.
In other words, it is possible that fewer tables could result in a somewhat shorter
document.
According to the thesis results, less table repetition did not necessarily indicate a shorter
document and the reason for this might be that the representation of category 2 and 3 were
similar to each other, i.e., while the inclusion criteria of tables in category 1 and 4 were
clear, there was a fine line between inclusion of tables in category 2 and 3. If there were
additional categories with detailed descriptions the results would show clearer differences
between the categories and the number of pages. Unfortunately, as the results were
collected by the author alone, time did not allow more detailed categorization of the tables.
The results might depend on other factors as well. If repetition between different sections
84

occurs, the number of pages might stay higher despite minimum repetition of table content
in the text.
The figures did not follow the same trend as the tables. The results showed that module
2.7.2 had the highest number of figures compared to the other modules (2.7.1, 2.7.3,
2.7.4). The clinical pharmacology and modeling data that is found in module 2.7.2
documents are usually better presented in figures, which will help the reader to understand
the data. On the other hand, a reason why figures are not presented in such a high number
in other modules might be because it is easier to create summary tables with numbers than
to create clear and reader-friendly figures of the given data. An exception here might be
laboratory value data, which are more easily presented as figures. However, documents
that had a higher number of figures did not necessarily have a smaller number of tables.
In other words, tables were not always exchanged for figures in module 2.7.2, but both
figures and tables could be expressed in a high volume for one specific document. The
combination of both tables and figures increased the total number of pages in several
documents. A general way to reduce the document length would be to reassess how data
is presented and to include fewer figures and tables. Prior reducing the number of tables
or figures, a detailed discussion with the authority is required to understand what the
authority is expecting from the sponsor and to ensure that essential details are included in
the application dossier. This discussion is organized via a pre-submission briefing book
and in a pre-submission meeting.
The CTD standards were generally followed for the level-1 headings and subheadings.
However, a number of variations were identified between the documents of different
sponsors and some documents had included additional level-1 headings. Additional
subheadings were included for all documents, therefore increasing their length with
supplementary details. When writing the documents, it is always important that they are
structured in a way that it is easy to guide the reader through all the sections. As stated in
the CTD guideline "Throughout the Common Technical Document, the display of
information should be unambiguous and transparent, in order to facilitate the review of
the basic data and to help a reviewer become quickly oriented to the application contents"
(EMA, 2004). It is implied that having a long document with an unclear structure might
85

be difficult for the reader to follow. Subheadings are included to ease the reader through
a complex and detailed document and allow the reviewer to concentrate on one specific
topic at a time. As the results showed, the high numbers of subheadings are vastly used
by all of the sponsors, compared to the number of subheadings recommended by the CTD.
Sponsors might have the impression that a vast number of subheadings are necessary as
the number of subheadings recommended by the CTD might lead to poorly structured
documents. This may be a reason why additional subheadings are included. On the other
hand, additional subheadings might in turn lead to inclusion of non-essential details or
repetition of data. Writing documents with a length closer to the CTD recommendations
might be possible if the level-1 headings and subheadings were divided according to the
CTD guideline and if only information that is specified for these specific documents was
included.
There might be many reasons why additional content (in addition to the CTD
recommendations) is included in the documents. When writing strategies are discussed it
is essential to consider what data is vital to present in the documents. The writing
approaches are thoroughly discussed with the health authority, and essential data is
identified. In this occasion, the CTD recommendations are secondary as the meetings with
the authority will set the base for the key points. Implementation of the essential
information might lead to use of more level-1 headings and subheading with the intention
to create a reader-friendly document. Additionally, there are other recommendations to be
followed except the CTD guideline, e.g., recommendations based on the number of
summarized studies and how to structure them. There may also be a reason to mention the
CTD recommendation itself that was introduced long time ago and might be rather
outdated.
There are also other factors that will influence both the document length and how well the
CTD recommendations are followed. The planning of the trial itself, the chemical entity
and the product type (e.g., generic or orphan) are example of these factors. For instance,
today there are more rules to be followed when performing the clinical trials. Chemical
entities are also more complex than before, and more difficult descriptions and detailed
reporting are required. In addition, it is more challenging to develop new drugs based on
86

small molecules and development of biological drugs have become widespread in the
pharmaceutical industry, which requires even further detailed clarifications to ensure
safety and efficacy.

6.2 Sponsor differences
Individual writing techniques could be a result of variation within a specific sponsor as
there are several medical writers interpreting the results. Particular medical writers might
favor the inclusion of supplementary information to make it clear for the reader, while
other medical writers may try to include as little information as possible. It is also
important to remember that what is written in the documents does not only depend on the
medical writers but the whole study team. There might be sponsor-specific, countryspecific, or even individual preferences to explain what information should be included,
i.e., senior experts might have created their own perspective of what to include in the
documents, which could lead to differences in each document.
While a fast marketing authorization is the key goal for each sponsor, the writing strategies
to reach the goal may differ. For some sponsors the strategy is built up to include extensive
amount of content and repetition to ensure that the endpoints and benefits are clearly
understood. Other sponsors may concentrate on a clear message with short descriptions
and less repetition.

6.3 What have we learned?
If guidelines with greater details were implemented, a clearer understanding of how data
should be presented would arise and there would be less room for misinterpretation.
Simplifying the documentation process could impact resources, quality and, in addition,
it would be crystal clear how the authorities should interpret data. When documents are
simplified, less repetition is found in the text. When less repetition is found in the text,
there is a reduced risk that errors occur when updates in the text are required. Besides
repetition, it is also important to understand how to present data. Individual patient data
always have a higher chance of being reidentified, resulting in an increased need for
redaction resources, whereas redaction resources are reduced if data are summarized.

87

Not only the sponsor’s resources but also patients would benefit from document
simplification. There would be increased trust between the public and the sponsor, as
unnecessary information that might lead to reidentification of a particular person who
participated in the trial would be excluded. It is not well defined which simplification
approaches apply to which sponsor, but it is obvious that all sponsors should examine their
approaches and consider whether the documents could be simplified. Nevertheless, the
collected data clearly show that there is room for improvement for all sponsors regarding
the document length. Improvements could be, e.g.:
❖ To simplify the documentation at the start of the writing process
❖ To follow the CTD recommendations carefully and narrow down the content
accordingly
❖ To implement fewer explanatory figures and tables, especially tables
❖ To reduce repetitive writing processes and create a better relationship between
tables and text
❖ To implement number of level-1 headings and subheadings in accordance with
the CTD
❖ To delete out-of-scope text for a specific document
❖ To place information, if possible, in sections that will not be publicly available
❖ To reduce repetition by mentioning the same conclusions, paragraphs or table
content once or as few times as possible, which would shorten the total document
length
❖ To include cross-references where possible instead of repeating what is said
elsewhere. Highest potential for cross-referencing is into module 5 (Clinical Study
Reports) documents
Improvements would not only be beneficial for the sponsor but also the regulatory
authorities, e.g.:
❖ To update the CTD guideline by taking into consideration the new transparency
guidelines
❖ To make more detailed recommendations in the guidelines to create less sponsor
variation

88

❖ Regulatory authorities should be more transparent with what kind of information
must be included in the MAA

6.4 Other thoughts
It should be considered whether the sponsors should modify the writing strategies as the
regulations and recommendations are changing, in order to keep up with transparency
measures. Another concern is whether it is possible to keep up with the changes and
whether the recommendations (e.g., the CTD guideline) take into consideration that some
parts of the modules are to be made publicly available.
EMA has certain recommendations for how PPD (Protected Personal Data) and CCI
(Commercially Confidential Information) should be handled, i.e., redaction and
anonymization recommendations. According to EMA, PPD is preferred to be anonymized
where possible, however, it is the sponsor's responsibility to clarify the PPD and the
calculated risks of re-identification must be provided in the anonymization report. EMA
also provide some guidance for direct and indirect identification of an individual who
participated in a trial. In accordance with EMA, CCI often must be redacted and a
justification table is used as a communication tool where the sponsor clarifies the
reasonings for CCI redactions in each document. The justifications are either accepted,
partially accepted or rejected by EMA (or HC). Further explanations can be provided by
the sponsor if needed but the final conclusion is formed by EMA. The sponsor can appeal
to the Court of Justice of the European Union in case an agreement concerning CCI cannot
be reached.
Since the authorities ultimately decide which redaction and anonymization suggestions
are approved - are the authorities sympathetic to sponsors considering the burden of
potentially releasing patient and company information or do they focus purely on what
they believe to be important?
A whole new discussion could also be focused on the recommendations. There are
numerous initiatives that try to include additional countries for a harmonized document
structure, which should lead to similar structures and easily readable documents. Stronger
harmonization than what we have today would reduce interpretation, and details like how
89

to repeat, what to repeat and how many figures and tables to include could become clearer.
The ideal solution would be to have stricter rules that would cover the grey area. Resources
would be reduced, as it would be easier to follow the guidance and less discussion of how
to present data would be required. The question remains whether recommendations can
create strong harmonization between sponsors or whether concrete directions should be
put in place.

90

7 Further investigations
In order to draw conclusions between document structures and specific indications, it
would require several different analyses on an increased scale with specific indications
and document types. However, today there are not enough module 2 packages to be
compared and a more thorough analysis would have to wait a couple of years until
additional submission packages have been published on the respective websites of EMA
and HC.

8 Summary in Swedish - Svensk sammanfattning
Potential för förenkling av skrivandet av inlämningsdokument för
läkemedel: Utvärdering av allmänt tillgängliga modul 2-dokument från
olika läkemedelsföretag
Detta projekt handlar om möjligheterna att förenkla skrivandet av kliniska modul 2.5och 2.7-dokument som är en del av de dokument som blir offentligt tillgängliga efter
ansökan om ett marknadstillstånd. Tillgängligheten är ett resultat av de transparenta
regler vi har idag.

1 Introduktion
Innan läkemedlet kan börja användas måste det gå igenom olika faser av säkerhets- och
effektivitetssprövningar. Dessa delas in i pre-kliniska och kliniska prövningar.
I pre-kliniska prövningar fastställs de första toxikologiska och farmakologiska testerna
samt säkerhetsprövningar. Det är en förberedelse för att hitta ett säkert läkemedel samt en
säker dos för människan i de efterföljande kliniska prövningarna. Data från dessa prekliniska prövningar skickas in till myndigheterna som fattar beslut kring om prövningarna
kan gå vidare till följande fas, de kliniska prövningarna. (David J. Kerr, 2006; E.L.
Andrade, 2016).
Kliniska prövningar utförs på människor (både friska och sådana med ifrågavarande
sjukdom) för att undersöka det bästa sättet att diagnostisera och behandla en sjukdom.
Prövningarna fokuserar på läkemedlets effektivitet, säkerhet och toxicitet samt att hitta de
rätta och mest effektiva läkemedelsdoserna. Data från dessa prövningar skickas återigen
in till myndigheterna som beslutar om ett läkemedelstillstånd kan utfärdas. (David J. Kerr,
2006).

2 CTD - Common Technical Document
Alla dokument som skickas in till läkemedelsmyndigheten måste följa vissa strukturer.
Ett regelverk som många länder följer är ett dokument som heter "Common Technical
Document" (CTD). CTD-riktlinjer är rekommendationer som upprätthålls av ICH
92

(International Conference on Harmonisation) och består av fem olika delar: modul 1,
modul 2, modul 3, modul 4 och modul 5. Varje modul innehåller detaljerade instruktioner
om hur dokumenten bör formateras (t.ex. specifika rubriker, textstil, marginaler) och i
vilka sektioner specifik information bör finnas. (EMA, 2003; EMA, 2004; EMA, 2016).
Alla läkemedelsföretag som följer CTD-standarderna har samma dokumentstruktur, vilket
i sin tur leder till att skrivprocessen blir mindre tidskrävande och såvida minskar
resursbehovet. En global standard gör det lättare att läsa och hitta information, både för
tillsynsmyndigheterna och läkemedelsindustrin. (EMA, 2004).
Modul 1 innehåller administrativ information och förskrivningsinformation som i sig själv
inte räknas in i CTD. Modul 2 är slutsatser och sammanfattningar av modul 3, 4 och 5.
Modul 3 innehåller information om kvalitet, modul 4 handlar om preklinisk säkerhet (så
kallade toxikologiska prövningar) och modul 5 handlar om klinisk effektivitet. (EMA,
2003).
Alla moduler är vidare uppdelade i olika avsnitt och delområden. Alla dessa moduler är
alltså del av marknadsföringstillståndet för en läkemedelsprodukt och av dessa måste (som
en följd av de nyaste transparensreglerna) modul 2-och modul 5-dokument publiceras för
allmänheten. Eftersom denna avhandling handlar om allmänt tillgängliga modul 2dokument kommer även fokus att ligga på dessa. Modul 2-dokument uppdelas i sju olika
delar:
❖
❖
❖
❖
❖
❖
❖

(2.1) CTD - Innehållsförteckning
(2.2) CTD - Introduktion
(2.3) Övergripande kvalitetssammanfattning
(2.4) Icke-klinisk översikt
(2.5) Klinisk översikt
(2.6) Icke-kliniska skriftliga och tabulerade sammanfattningar
(2.7) Klinisk sammanfattning. (EMA, 2003).

Av dessa delar är de allmänt tillgängliga dokumenten endast den kliniska
översiktsmodulen-2.5 och den kliniska sammanfattningsmodulen-2.7. Dessa delas
vidare upp i sina egna avsnitt och delområden:

93

❖ Modul 2.5 - Klinisk översikt
❖ Modul 2.7.1 - Klinisk sammanfattning av biofarmaceutiska prövningar och
analysmetoder
❖ Modul 2.7.2 - Klinisk sammanfattning av kliniska farmakologiska prövningar
❖ Modul 2.7.3 - Klinisk sammanfattning av klinisk effekt
❖ Modul 2.7.4 - Klinisk sammanfattning av klinisk säkerhet. (EMA, 2016).
Dessa moduler har sedan sina egna huvud-och underrubriker. Huvudrubrikerna hittas i
kapitel 2.1, Table 2.

3 Ansökan om läkemedelstillstånd
Det flesta nya läkemedel i Europa godkänns genom ett så kallat centraliserat förfarande.
Detta betyder att ett läkemedelstillstånd kan sökas en gång och därmed godkännas i alla
europeiska medlemsstater tillika. Fördelen med detta förfarande är en centraliserad
säkerhetsövervakning samt produktinformation på alla EU-språk. När ett läkemedelstillstånd ansöks om hos den europeiska läkemedelsmyndigheten (EMA) påbörjas en högst
314 dagar lång granskningsprocess som slutar i ett godkännande eller avkastande av
läkemedlet. En del av de dokument som hör till läkemedelstillståndsansökan kommer
senare bli publicerade för allmänheten och detta är ett resultat av transparensen som krävs
inom läkemedelsindustrin. (EMA, 2019)

4 Transparens i Europa och Kanada
När det gäller kliniska läkemedelsprövningar är de främsta orsakerna för transparens:
❖ Att skapa förtroende mellan allmänheten och läkemedelsindustrin
❖ Att ge möjligheten för vem som helst att analysera olika prövningar och att skapa
en personlig uppfattning om en viss produkt
❖ Att tvinga fram innovativt tänkande och skapa forskningsmöjligheter för andra
företag (European Clinical Research Infrastructure (ECRIN), n.d.; EMA, n.d. (d))
Ett flertal riktlinjer gällande transparens har skrivits och tillämpats under årens lopp.
Kontinuerliga uppdateringar och nya riktlinjer har lett till var vi står idag. Kraven och
riktlinjerna kommer kontinuerligt att utvecklas och det slutliga resultatet av denna
implementering förväntas leda till publicering av alla kliniska prövningar, oavsett resultat.

94

(European Clinical Research Infrastructure (ECRIN), n.d.; EMA, n.d. (d); Health Canada,
Public Release of clinical Information: guidance document, 2019a).
➢ EMA Policy 0070 och Health Canada PRCI
De senaste riktlinjerna för transparens har implementerats i Europa (EMA Policy 0070)
och Kanada (Health Canada PRCI) under åren 2015 och 2019. Dessa riktlinjer har gjort
det möjligt för detta projekt att existera, eftersom modul 2.5- och 2.7 dokument, som är
en del av läkemedelstillståndet, nu är allmänt tillgängliga. (European Clinical Research
Infrastructure (ECRIN), n.d.; EMA, n.d. (d); Health Canada, Public Release of clinical
Information: guidance document, 2019a).
Riktlinjerna innehåller information om vilka dokument som bör publiceras offentligt i
Europa, respektive Kanada. Dessa riktlinjer ger även vägledning i hur anonymisering och
redigering av företagshemligheter och persondata bör utföras i de olika dokumenten.
(European commission, 2015; Health Canada, 2019a).

5 Målsättning
Målet med denna avhandling är att analysera möjliga förslag för att förenkla utarbetandet
av offentligt tillgängliga modul 2-dokument genom att:
❖ Jämföra strukturella skillnader i 20 olika modul 2-dokument för 10 olika
sponsorer13
❖ Jämföra mängden datarepetition mellan texttabeller och textstycken i modul 2dokument
Syftet är att klargöra om omfattande variationer existerar mellan sponsorernas dokument
och skrivstrategier. De nuvarande skrivprocesserna är tids- och resurskrävande och det
skulle vara fördelaktigt att kunna eliminera överflödig och upprepad information i
dokumenten.
Avsikten är att göra alla läkemedelsföretag medvetna om resultaten och hur
rekommendationerna kan implementeras i det dagliga arbetet.

13

En sponsor är det ledande företaget som ekonomiskt stödjer en aktivitet eller ett evenemang, ofta ett
läkemedelsföretag

6 Material och metoder
➢ Litteraturöversikt
En litteraturöversikt av CTD, läkemedelstillståndsprocessen och transparensriktlinjer är
nödvändig för att skapa en förståelse av dessa modul 2-dokument.
CTD

beskriver

reglerna

för

dokumenteringsstrukturen

som

krävs

för

ett

marknadstillstånd. Läkemedelstillståndsprocessen klargörs genom beskrivning av
prekliniska prövningar till ett marknadstillstånd och transparentriktlinjerna anger tydligt
vad som menas med transparens, dess nödvändighet och hur detta ska tillämpas i de olika
dokumenten.
➢ Sponsorer och dokument
Inom ramen för denna forskning har författaren valt att undersöka 10 sponsorer. För varje
sponsor har valts två allmänt tillgängligt modul 2-dokumentpaket. Ett paket från EMA:s
webbsida och ett paket från Health Canadas webbsida. Tillsammans blir det en full analys
av 10 olika sponsorer och 20 modul 2-dokument. Ett modul 2-dokumentpaket avser de
allmänt tillgängliga dokumenten i modulavsnitten: 2.5, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3 och 2.7.4.
➢ Variabler
Vid tidpunkten för dokumentuppladdning registrerades följande information:
❖ Indikation, ACT kod, först-i-klass läkemedel, publiceringsår och
dokumentationstyp
För en kvantitativ analys jämfördes följande variabler:
❖ Antalet sidor per dokument
❖
❖
❖
❖

Antalet tabeller
Antalet figurer
Antalet huvudrubriker och underrubriker
Indelning av tabeller i fyra olika kategorier, beroende på hur mycket av
informationen i tabellerna som repeteras i textformat (endast analys av modul
2.5- och 2.7.4-dokument)

96

7 Resultat
CTD-riktlinjer är endast rekommendationer och strukturvariationer från dessa
rekommendationer betyder inte att dokumenten är inkorrekta.
Enligt CTD-strukturen bör modul 2.5-dokumenten vara omkring 30 sidor långa. Av alla
modul 2.5-dokument hade 95 % åtminstone 50 sidor långa dokument och därav följdes
inte

CTD-rekommendationen.

Rekommenderad

sidolängd

för

det

kliniska

sammanfattningsdokumentet 2.7 (modul 2.7.1, 2.7.2, 2.7.3 och 2.7.4) bör vara runt 50 till
400 sidor. Endast 55 % av dokumenten uppfyllde denna rekommendation.
Enligt CTD-rekommendationerna föredras tabeller och figurer i dokumenten när det kan
förbättra läsbarheten men det är dock upp till sponsorn att bestämma när information och
resultat ska presenteras i sådan form för att ge bättre klarhet. Detta är en vag
rekommendation som resulterar i olika tolkningar, vilket även framgick i datainsamlingen
som tydligt visade att mängden figurer och tabeller varierade mellan olika sponsorer.
Alla sponsorer följde CTD-strukturen gällande huvudrubrikerna men mängden
information och titelnamn som presenterades i varje avsnitt varierade både mellan
dokumentmodulerna och sponsorerna. En del sponsorer inkluderade dock fler
huvudrubriker än vad som rekommenderas av CTD. Det är tydligt att alla sponsorer
tolkade riktlinjerna på sitt eget sätt och en gråzon med utrymme för egna slutsatser var
synlig. Detta var ett resultat som visade att resursanvändningen varierarar mellan
sponsorerna eftersom vissa sponsorer inkluderar mer data i dokumenten än andra.
Enligt CTD bör modul 2.5 inkludera 7 underrubriker vilket ingen sponsor följde eftersom
alla hade inkluderat 21 eller fler underrubriker. CTD har inga specifika krav på
underrubriker för modul 2.7.1 och 2.7.2 men majoriteten av alla dokument överskred 10
eller fler underrubriker. Module 2.7.3 inkluderade 3 underrubriker och modul 2.7.4
inkluderade 15 underrubriker. Endast ett dokument följde rekommendationen för modul
2.7.3 och inga dokument följde rekommendationen för modul 2.7.4. Båda modulerna
(2.7.3 och 2.7.4) överskred underrubriksmängden med upp till 105 respektive 138
underrubriker.

Det finns inte några specifika rekommendationer om hur man bör upprepar data från
tabeller i textformat men det är underförstått att upprepning av något slag bör undvikas.
Repetition av data från tabeller i textformat skedde i olika grad men en modulspecifik
trend var synlig. I modul 2.5-dokumenten ansågs det mindre viktigt att upprepa data från
tabeller i textformat medan mer upprepning föredrogs i modul 2.7.4-dokumenten.
Eftersom modul 2.5-dokumenten endast är en översikt och modul 2.7.4-dokumenten en
sammanfattning var också dessa resultat förväntade. Även om det var lätt att upptäcka en
trend mellan de olika modulerna, fanns det fortfarande en individuell skillnad mellan
sponsorerna.

8 Slutsatser
Mer detaljerade riktlinjer skulle resultera i en tydligare förståelse för hur data ska
presenteras och gråzonen för tolkningsutrymme skulle försvinna. En förenklad
dokumentations-process kan påverka resurserna och det skulle bli tydligare för
myndigheterna hur data bör tolkas. Mindre upprepning betyder mindre risk för misstag i
de fall då dokumenten bör uppdateras. Förutom upprepning är det också viktigt att förstå
vilket det bästa sättet är att presentera data. Enskilda patientdata har alltid en högre chans
till patientidentifiering, vilket resulterar i ett större behov av redigerings- och
anonymiseringsresurser. Om data däremot presenteras på en sammanfattande nivå
minimeras dessa resurser.
Dokumentförenkling skulle inte bara vara till nytta för sponsorerna men ur ett
patientperspektiv skulle ett ökat förtroende mellan allmänheten och sponsorerna skapas, i
och med att fokus skulle ligga på att exkludera onödig information som kan leda till
identifiering av en specifik patient.
Rekommenderade förbättringar kunde till exempel vara:
❖ Att förenkla dokumentationen i början av skrivprocessen
❖ Att implementera färre figurer och tabeller
❖ Att minska på repetitiva skrivprocesser och skapa en bättre relation mellan text
och tabeller

98

❖ Att implementera färre underrubriker och mindre text, för att på detta sätt förkorta
dokumentlängden
❖ Att radera text som är utanför omfånget för ett visst dokument
❖ Att placera information (i den mån det är möjlighet) i moduler som inte är allmänt
tillgängliga
❖ Att nämna slutsatser, paragrafer eller tabellinnehåll endast en gång, vilket skulle
leda till mindre upprepning samt förkortning av den totala dokumentlängden
❖ Att använd korsreferenser där det är möjligt istället för att upprepa vad som redan
nämnts i en annan modul eller i ett annat avsnitt i samma dokument
