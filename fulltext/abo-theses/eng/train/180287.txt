Title: Market-shaping and sustainability communication within the clothing
industry: A Generation Y consumer perspective
Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
Abstract:
Climate change is progressing at an ever-increasing alarming rate with continuous
proof of the devastating effects it brings with it. The clothing industry is one of the
largest polluters, making up more than all emissions from both international flights
and maritime shipping combined. If we are going to slow down climate change and
stay underneath the critical 1,5 degrees Celsius, the clothing industry and all its
actors must work towards making a complete switch towards increased
sustainability.
In this thesis, I study how companies can shape the market to increase sustainability,
how these sustainability efforts are communicated externally and how consumers of
Generation Y perceive this type of communication. Swedish Stockings was chosen
for this case study as the company openly state that they are trying to conduct
market-shaping to increase sustainability within the hosiery industry. Generation Y
was chosen as it is one of the most important groups on the market purchase wise.
The thesis has a multi-qualitative research method, meaning that the data was
collected through a company interview with Swedish Stockings’ CEO Linn
Frisinger and two focus groups with a total of ten Swedish speaking Finns between
the ages of 23-29. The company interview was done over the phone and the two
focus groups were conducted separately over Zoom with both video and audio. The
focus group participants were shown a portfolio representative of the
communication conducted by Swedish Stockings on their Instagram profile. All
three occasions of data collection were recorded and subsequently transcribed and
coded into different themes. The interview with Swedish Stockings provided a point

of reference for what intent their social media communication had. The comparison
between Linn Frisinger’s answers with the brand perception of the focus group
participants, it became evident that some of the company communication was
successful, resulting in increased consumer interest and a chance for product
purchase. A positive perception of the communication is significant for marketshaping and the change of consumer and competitor behaviour. However, not all
communication was received well, and the campaign “This is us – this is them” was
the cause of multiple participants’ disapproval and negative brand perception.
This thesis shows the need for managers to understand the benefits and risks of
conducting market-shaping and sustainability communication. When not done
correctly, sustainability communication is perceived by some as excessively
provocative or preachy. This may lead to negative consumer brand perception and
may oppose or impede market-shaping as well as increased sustainability.

1. Introduction
As awareness of the current climate crisis is spreading, companies and consumers alike
have to rethink their behaviours and prepare for major disrupting developments in the
near future. Firms must update their business models and invent new and more
sustainable supply chains and products to adapt to imminent environmental and
judicial changes, as well as become competitive in the long run (De Jong, Harkink and
Barth, 2018).
The fashion industry is especially problematic from an environmental point of view,
producing 10 % of all carbon emissions. This is more than all emissions from maritime
shipping and all international flights combined (McFall-Johnsen, 2019). The industry
further has a major negative impact on water usage and pollution as well as human and
animal welfare. Companies operating within the industry must rethink their actions
and their consequences more so than others and should promote competitors to do the
same. One way of doing so, is through producing sustainable and environmentally
friendly products, shape the market and make consumers choose their products above
others.
People looking to make sustainable choices within the fashion industry have two ways
to go. Either choose second-hand items or opt for ethically sourced products. When it
comes to undergarments such as underwear or stockings, most people choose the latter
as it is deemed more hygienic. This enables a market within ethically sourced
undergarments to thrive and possibly take up a continuously larger part of the
unethically sourced product market. That is, if the organisational actors know how to
portray themselves and communicate information to consumers in a positive and
convincing way.
This thesis explores the modern view of malleable markets and how firms can adjust
markets to themselves instead of the opposite (Kjellberg et al. 2012). This way of
thinking makes it possible for sustainable organisations to shape the market and make
it develop in a certain direction which not only will help the market and industry but
also offer more value to consumers and have a positive environmental impact.
Furthermore, this thesis studies how companies can shape the market all the while
gaining a competitive edge amongst consumers as well as gives an understanding of
how consumers view these company efforts. It also discusses how these efforts affect
1

consumers’ interest in the company’s products. The method used is a multi-qualitative
one that consists of a focus group discussion and semi-structured interviews with
company representatives.

1.1 Problem definition
The current environmental situation crisis forces companies of all industries to change
the way they conduct business and invent new ways of producing more sustainable
products. Markets need to develop in a direction which puts less strain on the
environment, all the while making it possible for organisations to remain competitive
and offer products of great value to their consumers. Several businesses have already
started to rethink their practices, and some are also encouraging others to do the same
in an effort to create a more sustainable market. These efforts need to be conveyed in
a way that positively affects the competition and consumers alike so that consumers
chose sustainable alternatives over those offered by the competition.

1.2. Objective and research questions
This thesis is a case study of Swedish Stockings, a hosiery company which presents
itself to consumers and competitors as a market shaper mainly within the stockings
industry. The company mainly focuses on the Scandinavian market and is based in
Sweden, however, it can also be seen as “born global”, as it solely communicates in
English, allows for online purchase worldwide and ships their products abroad, as
well as the company’s outspoken aims for future market positions (Yin Wong &
Merrilees, 2012).
The purpose of this thesis is to offer further understanding of how sustainability efforts
within market-shaping are communicated by companies and how consumers perceive
and react to this communication. Sustainability is a more relevant issue than ever
before, and companies need to take part in market-shaping and communicating
sustainability efforts to their consumers as well as knowing how to do this in a way
that will be positively perceived by consumers. This is not only true for the stockings
and underwear market but all companies operating within the clothing industry.

2

Therefore, the three main research questions which will be answered through this
thesis are:
•

How do companies communicate their efforts to shape the market to achieve
sustainability?

•

How do consumers within Generation Y perceive and react to companies’
efforts to shape markets in this way?

•

How is Generation Y’s perception of sustainability communication described
in scientific research?

Due to its limitations, this study will not be able to answer any questions regarding
what the future looks like for companies using sustainability communication as a
market-shaping tool. It is however highly relevant and important to discuss potential
future scenarios about what happens if companies like Swedish Stockings achieves
their market-shaping goals and change the business into a sustainable one. As it is only
possible to speculate about it, it cannot be one of the research questions, but
nonetheless, it is discussed both in the company interview, focus group discussions, as
well as in chapter 6. Discussion and conclusions.

1.3 Delimitations
The empirical research is geographically delimited to the two Nordic countries Sweden
and Finland, despite the company in question being seemingly born global and is
operating on an international scale. The interview was carried out with Sweden based
CEO and co-founder Linn Frisinger over the phone as this was the easiest way of me
reaching her and carry out an oral semi-structured interview. The focus group consists
of Swedish Speaking Finnish individuals between the ages of 23-29 with mixed
backgrounds, education, and occupations. These individuals are part of the target
audience for Swedish Stockings’ communication and are therefore legitimate focus
group participants. That they all speak Swedish is needed for improving the flow of
the focus group discussion. The study is limited to opinions of 10 cis-gender
individuals due to the lack of availability of any LGBTQ+ individuals. This is
important to mention and must be considered throughout the thesis and when reading
the analysis later. In this thesis I have chosen to only refer to cis-men and cis-women
as these were the only ones who participated in the study and are therefore the only
3

genders I can speak of regarding their opinions. The reason for having 3 men
participate despite Swedish Stockings’ target audience consisting of mainly women
was to give more diverse opinions. This was further needed because of Swedish
Stockings’ recent move to enter the furniture market through their recycling program
and venturing outside of the female-dominated target group.

1.4 Method
The thesis aims to develop a deeper understanding of Generation Y’s perception of
sustainability market-shaping as well as what effects companies seek to evoke by
openly communicating about their sustainability and market-shaping efforts. This
thesis uses a multi-qualitative method in the form of focus group discussions and a
company interview as this is an adequate method for better understanding individuals’
genuine thoughts and experiences. The method further allows for additional questions
and interactions between the researcher and the interview subjects, as well as amongst
the interview subjects themselves. The focus group discussions offer an in-depth
insight into consumers’ thoughts and perceptions, whereas the company interview
further helps investigate the point of view of the organisation in question.

1.5 Key concepts
Defining key concepts within sustainability is sometimes avoided even by researchers
as it is very complex, yet most people have an idea of what the concept incorporates
(Salas-Zapata & Ortiz-Muñoz, 2019). The following chapter aims to define and clarify
the key concepts used throughout the thesis to avoid any misunderstandings or
misconceptions caused by the lack of definitions.

Market-shaping
Market-shaping is the process of change within a market, initiated by one or multiple
actors (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2018). It is based on the modern notion that markets are
not stable structures, but rather that they are very socially complex, always developing
and therefore also highly influenceable.

4

Brand
The company brand identity is the only thing the company itself can influence to
express themselves outwards and affect other market actors and consumers.

Consumer brand perception
Consumer brand perception is based on experiences or word of mouth and affects
consumers’ willingness to invest in the company. A positive consumer brand
perception is crucial for being successful, changing consumer behaviour and shape the
market.

Sustainability
Sustainability can be of social, economic, or environmental character or cover all three.
Most deem it to be mainly of an environmental character (Salas-Zapata, Rios-Osorio
& Cardona-Arias, 2018).

Generation Y
Generation Y, also called millennials, are a powerful cohort of consumers with a future
full of potential consumer choices (Williams & Page, 2011). The generation’s age
range differs depending on the source and is therefore defined in this thesis as people
born between 1981 and 1999.

Communication
Communication is essential for conducting market-shaping and affecting consumer
brand perception. Communication can be carried out in multiple ways and is about
transferring information between two or more actors. The actor expressing the
information wants the communication to be received and understood in a specific way,
but this is not always successful. Measures can be taken to improve the probability of

5

the communication being received in the way the expresser wants and consist of
pictures, words, videos etc.

1.6 Disposition
The thesis is divided into six main chapters, followed by a Swedish summary,
references and appendixes. The first chapter contains the introduction which offers a
general overview of the thesis, its research area, and questions, as well as key concepts
and delimitations. The second main chapter makes up the theoretical framework and
literature review.
The third chapter, the methodology, covers the choice of research method, how the
pilot interviews as well as focus groups and company interview were carried out. The
chapter also explains how the focus group portfolio was put together, how participants
were chosen, how all data was ultimately analysed and concludes in a discussion about
the research method’s credibility and trustworthiness.
The fourth chapter contains the analysis of the acquired data followed by the fifth
chapter results. The final main chapter contains the discussion and conclusion which
offers managerial implications, limitations to the research as well as highlights
potential further research.

2. Market-shaping and sustainability
The following two chapters (2 and 3) make up the thesis’ theoretical framework. The
chapters discuss key concepts such as market-shaping, corporate sustainability
concerning market-shaping and communication with consumer brand perception for
Generation Y. These chapters offer a deeper understanding of the concepts and help
answer the research questions, with the support of the data collected, analysis and
results. First, the meaning of market-shaping and how it can be used by companies will
be presented, followed by the use of market-shaping within sustainable development.
Chapter 3 discusses the use of communication as a tool for achieving market-shaping
and increased sustainability. The connections between all three concepts and their
theories are highlighted.

2.1 Market-shaping
Market-shaping and its practices have received increasing attention over the last few
years (cf. Baker & Nenonen, 2020; Baker et al., 2019, Kindström et al., 2018;
Kjellberg et al., 2012, Nenonen & Storbacka, 2018, Nenonen et al., 2019). The concept
has been discussed using different terminology, ranging from market-driving
strategies, market scripting and market innovation to market-shaping (Nenonen et al.,
2020). Drawing upon the ideas of Harrison & Kjellberg (2016), Kindström et al.,
(2018) and Nenonen et al. (2019), the term market-shaping is used throughout this
thesis. Scholars such as Kindström et al. (2018) emphasize the need for more research
within market-shaping and for more studies focusing on markets instead of only the
organisations, as these have been previously overlooked (Storbacka & Nenonen,
2011). As markets become increasingly complex structures (Trim & Lee, 2008) and
face more threats in the form of e.g., climate change and its effects or global
pandemics, marketers, academics, and managers must continuously develop and
deepen their understanding for markets and how these can be changed (Beninger &
Francis, 2020). Markets can be described as living structures, as they are dynamic and
continuously change. This change can be due to a multitude of factors such as crises
or societal change but is even more so the effect of market actors’ activities and
market-shaping (Cova, Ivens & Spencer, 2020).

7

For years, markets have been considered fixed structures which may slowly develop.
However, in later years, research suggests that such perceptions of markets are
incorrect and outdated. Market-shaping in its core is based on the realisation that
markets are dynamic, malleable, ever-evolving and socially constructed (Kjellberg et
al., 2012). They make up highly complex systems yet are easily influenced and are
therefore able to be caused to move in a certain direction (Baker et al., 2019). The
market-shaping process is carried out through intentional activities by one or multiple
companies or shapers in the aim to change the characteristics of a market and
everything connected to it, including the behaviours, expectations, practices,
structures, and norms of all stakeholders (Nenonen et al., 2019; Baker & Nenonen,
2020). By making the market move in a specific direction and go through changes,
firms are not forced to adapt to the market to become successful, but rather have the
market adapt to the company itself (Baker et al., 2019).
When carried out in the right way, market-shaping results in previously unexplored
added value for both consumers and companies alike, as well as creates new
opportunities in an array of areas, including innovation (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015).
Innovation and market-shaping go hand in hand, and companies who are leaders within
innovation are usually also market-shaping leaders deciding in which direction the
market should develop next (Kumar et al., 2000). Companies understanding the
usefulness of market-shaping, and how to properly handle it, will have an immense
competitive advantage to competitors. However, it requires companies to remain open
and willing to develop together with each other and the market and be as dynamic as
the market itself (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015). Market-shaping is a collective and
cooperative action of network actors. Market shapers looking to influence other actors
should, according to Storbacka & Nenonen (2015), not learn about the market, but with
it. Additionally, they must continuously focus on innovation and spreading their
message in a way that is effective to them. Market learning is carried out in so-called
market learning cycles, which encourages a constant state of learning, improvement,
and change. This kind of complex and higher-level learning takes place in individuals’
inner “rooms” and within the limits of the organisation in question. The focus remains
on the cognitive processes which is the main method of learning, in addition to changes
within the mental models both company employees and stakeholders have.

8

2.2 Ways of achieving market-shaping
As market-shaping is a relatively unexplored concept, managers need to understand
how to execute it. Nenonen and Storbacka (2020), state, based on the current and
emerging literature on market-shaping, that there are eight steps within the marketshaping process. These are “(1) determining whether to act now or actively wait, (2)
deciding whether to be a shaper or supporter, (3) developing a scalable vision for the
future market, (4) recognizing the minimum viable system linked in this vision, (5)
driving changes in market-level properties, (6) securing that value quantified and
shared, (7) inviting actor engagement for implementation, and (8) defending against
possible retaliation from threatened market systems.” The process results in a market
which has been shaped.
Step one requires the company to know the market and evaluate whether there are
enough resources or any affecting additional assets which are needed. If so, it may be
better for the company to wait to carry out its activities. The organisation must be able
to decide when would be the best moment to act or stay put, depending on the current
situation in society and on the market. The second step by Nenonen and Storbacka
(2020) speaks about how companies must choose between taking on a supporting or
leading role within market-shaping. Will the company become the innovator or
imitator – make the first move, follow quickly, or make a late entry? Supporter
companies are part of the collective effort to shape the market and see the benefits
from the change in the market, however, they can also spend significantly less money
and other resources on the market-shaping process. All the while being able to decide
in which direction the market-shaping should move. Supporter companies should
therefore also have an in-depth understanding of how to carry market-shaping
activities and the process as a whole. The two roles of supporter and shaper may also
change over time. It is recommended that companies are open to returning to
questioning their role in market-shaping and remain dynamic throughout their “lives”.
The third point is to develop a scalable version for the future market. Many market
actors start initiating market-shaping simply due to being heavily dissatisfied with the
current situation, questioning the norms and how things are done within the market. In
addition to being frustrated with the current state of things, market-shapers should
create potential alternative ways of solving specific problems. By identifying the
problems and innovating their solutions, the explanation can then be simplified and
9

transferred across market actor boundaries, which facilitates collaboration. The
importance of understanding the entire market and other companies’ value creation is
once again emphasized, as this allows for other actors to see the benefits of
participating in the market-shaping process (Nenonen et al., 2019). Creating a scalable
version for the future market naturally demands collaboration with other market actors
to be successful.
The fourth step according to Nenonen and Storbacka (2020) is recognizing the
minimum viable system linked to market-shaping vision. To implement marketshaping, the firm and its managers must understand the different levels of the
surrounding and affecting market, paying extra attention to the network interaction and
key actors. The minimum viable system speaks of which specific market actors are
needed to carry out the market-shaping in the most effective and straightforward way
possible. Step five speaks about driving changes in market-level properties. The
previous steps must be taken to initiate market-shaping; however, changes must also
be made within market-level properties such as market agendas, practices, and
structures (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015). This is usually done by first researching what
needs to be done within the minimal viable system, followed by the changes that
should be done within the wider external environment. These changes consist of
adapting business models through e.g., price adjustments, the network of actors and
modifying the competing offerings’ availability, or the market representations and
actor behaviour norms (Nenonen et al., 2019). Securing that value is quantified and
shared is the sixth step and entails the need for not only the company in the role of the
shaper to change its activities but also other market actors. Value proposition is one of
the key pieces of market-shaping strategies (Kindström et al. 2018), as it condenses
the advantages for each specific market actor of the future market. In the future
scenario, benefits should be made evident to all actors. The market-shaping strategy is
further validated by the support of multiple market actors and is therefore essential to
make evident to a larger group as early as possible. All above-mentioned strategies of
the market-shaping process will be useless unless they can be implemented. Step seven
is about inviting actor engagement to implement, which forces managers to opt for
collaborative strategies instead of competitive ones and allow coordination efforts
between companies. The collaboration ultimately allows for further added value for
all actors within this network, as a single company can never seize the same
10

opportunities like the ones developed by the allocentric market view and network
cooperation (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2020). This seventh step enables actors to engage
in an open innovation process with collaborations extending over all types of
boundaries, such a s corporate or functional. The final and eighth step of the marketshaping process by Nenonen and Storbacka (2020) covers how to defend against
possible retaliation from threatened market systems. As previously stated, the actors
within the minimum viable system will benefit from market-shaping. However,
external actors will naturally want to keep up their competitive edge and probably do
not want to allow the market-shaping to happen, as it does not benefit them but rather
damages them, their profit and growth, both currently and in the future. Companies
wanting to be market-shapers must be ready for this kind of resistance and
continuously manage it by actors outside the minimum viable system (Peters et al.,
2020). This is mainly done by reallocating resources and providing additional support
for certain organisations within the network or specific practices.
Kindström et al. (2018) view market-shaping activities according to three levels:
system level, market offer level and technology level (figure 1). All three levels are
made up of three activities each. The system level is about the norms and regulations
which limit and rule the market. It is essential to understand the market as a whole and
to view the producers’, sellers’, and institutions’ part in both the problems and the
solutions. Activities within this level that market shapers need to carry out consist of
changing norms, affecting knowledge, and increasing morale. The second level
according to Kindström et al. (2018) is named the market offer and is about the
exchange of objects or the value of products and services. The associated activities are
understanding value and consumers and building credibility. The third and final level
mentioned by Kindström et al. (2018) is the technology level which focuses on the role
of technology to create and develop a market which enables and facilitates the findings
of problem solutions for current and future issues. The technology level’s activities are
building application knowledge, co-develop technologies and recreating processes.
Kindström et al. (2018) state that market-shaping is heavily facilitated when one
understands all three levels with their accompanying activities. The authors’ research
further highlighted the importance of carrying out activities from all three levels
simultaneously to obtain the best results possible and see the full effects of marketshaping.
11

Figure 1. The levels of influence used by market shapers and their accompanying activities
(Kindström et al., 2018).

The levels and activities suggested by Kindström et al. (2018) are similar to the
findings of Nenonen et al. (2019), which discuss the needed capabilities for marketshaping and their underlying activities. Their findings conclude in a similar
conceptualization of market-shaping and how to put it into practice but also go more
in-depth by categorizing their findings in four triggering capability sets, eight
triggering capabilities and twenty-five associated activities. Nenonen et al. (2019) also
show that firms conducting market-shaping view the market as network-based and
systemic. Market shapers do not only concentrate on what is within the limits of the
own company, but also try to change resources managed by competitors, organisations,
and individuals.
As previously mentioned, market-shaping is not an easy task, and to carry out the
above-mentioned activities or levels, the market shaper or market actor must obtain a
highly broad and varied knowledge level of it. A company wanting to conduct marketshaping must keep this in mind while recruiting and do so by focusing on hiring an
array of different personalities and skillsets. The education of already hired and new
employees is especially important within R&D and sales and should also be done
through interaction with the target groups to gain the consumers’ perceptions
(Ottosson & Kindström, 2016).
12

So far, the discussion has been about how companies or organisations can use marketshaping to change the direction and behaviour of the market. However, it should be
stated that not only firms and industry professionals can influence markets. Research
within the fashion market shows that consumers who are very engaged and digitally
connected can also heavily impact the market and the direction it takes (Dolbec &
Fischer, 2015). This is one of many reasons for companies to remain well informed of
consumers and their perceptions and behaviours and is also why this thesis further
aims to understand how market-shaping sustainability practices can be perceived by a
specific group of consumers.
In summary, market-shaping is a highly active market strategy which entails a
continuous understanding of the dynamics of the market and its different levels to be
implemented. Kindström et al. (2018) suggest carrying out as many activities as
possible at the same time while ensuring they can interact and affect each other. The
different activities can be developed and implemented for a short or long amount of
time and can follow different time frames or cycles. They can also be used to focus on
abstract or concrete subjects, i.e., changing specific areas within the market as unspoken norms or a certain target audience. Having the right kind of attitude is essential
to remain dynamic and be able to carry out activities from all three levels. The
importance of being able to change the way of learning and adapting is once again
highlighted, in addition to the possibility of allowing so-called “triggers” to initiate
new market learning cycles, no matter if these come from within or outside the own
company or market network (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015).

2.3 Sustainability – its definition and importance
As this thesis aims to better understand the consumer perception of companies’ efforts
to shape markets to become more sustainable, it is crucial to define the term
sustainability and its importance for society and our future. Because it is a well-known
term used in both the scientific and business world, one would assume that its
definition is simple and straight-forward. However, this is not the case, as the term is
highly complex and varies depending on whom you ask to define it. This ultimately
results in many researchers avoiding to define the term entirely (Salas-Zapita, RiosOsorio & Cardona-Arias, 2018). The following subchapters cover the importance of
sustainability, the definition used for the complex term in this thesis, as well as how it
can be achieved through market-shaping.
When addressing sustainability within the business and research world, multiple terms
are used, and sometimes interchangeably, such as CSR, CS, sustainable development,
and environmentalism. Often these terms are applied without any clear or
differentiating lines drawn between the concepts (Montiel, 2008; Van Marrewijk,
2003). Avoiding clear distinctions prohibits managers to properly define sustainability
within their own company, which in turn negatively affects the associated goals
(Montiel, 2008).
Sustainability in the business realm is often referring to social, economic, or
environmental issues and is then often discussed using the abbreviation CSR
(corporate social responsibility). Camilleri (2017) explains CSR through the statement
that “companies have responsibilities towards society beyond their economic and legal
duties”. However, this description often undermines the importance of environmental
sustainability and is therefore not explicit enough for this thesis. Therefore, when
speaking about sustainability in this thesis, it is referring to corporate sustainability
(CS) instead of CSR. CS derives from the Brundtland report (World Commission for
Environmental Development, 1987), where it was described as:
“Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability for future generations to meet their own needs.”

Since then, CS has seen varying definitions among academics and researchers. Some
see it as one-dimensional (environmental) and others as two-dimensional
(environmental and social issues). A larger number of academics view CS as a three14

dimensional construct which, similarly to CSR, incorporates three aspects: economic,
social, and environmental (Montiel, 2008; Bansal, 2005). This definition views all
three aspects as pillars which interact with each other, while simultaneously being
affected by external causes like legal, technological, or cultural (Baumgartner &
Ebner, 2010). The tri-dimensional construct can also be thought of as 3Ps, known as
planet, people, and profit (Montiel & Delgado-Ceballos, 2014).
Sustainability used to simply be a voluntary action according to the European
Commission, but as the understanding for the importance of sustainability and the
effect our and companies’ actions will have on our future grew, it was updated to
obligatory (European Commission, 2011). Organisations within the EU must now
disclose non-financial information, i.e., social and environmental factors, which prove
that the company is working towards achieving their goals within those fields
(European Parliament, 2014). Since their beginning, businesses have focused on
exploiting nature in the aim of profit. This has been done without either fully
understanding or simply caring about the final environmental results and negative
effects on our planet and future society overall (Amaro de Matos & Clegg, 2013). We
must change our current relationship with nature and our extreme dependence on it if
we and future generations will be able to survive on this planet. The economy must
become sustainable and be adjusted according to the natural resources and the frames
of nature (WWF, 2020).

2.4 Market-shaping as a tool for sustainability
Changing businesses’ organisational models to reduce the negative environmental
impacts is more important now than ever yet creates an array of challenges for
businesses and may seem daunting. Evolving and improving sustainability within
businesses requires organisations to confront all problem areas involving waste and
pollution. This further forces organisations to research and develop sustainable
production alternatives, all the while providing positive shareholder value (Amaro de
Matos & Clegg, 2013). Sustainability can be enforced and upheld by regulations and
laws which forcefully make companies carry out practices in ways that are more
beneficial to the environment, but it can also be introduced through other actions. One
way of changing how the markets and companies engage with each other and carry out
15

their activities is through market-shaping (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015). This
subchapter discusses market-shaping as a tool for increased sustainability, as well as
the various challenges traditional respectively new market actors may face.
Combining market-shaping with sustainability efforts offers an array of possibilities
for companies to initiate change on the market and shape it towards sustainability.
Increasing sustainability can be discussed through the three above-mentioned levels of
market-shaping by Kindström et al. (2018): technology level, market offer level and
system level. Market-shaping goes hand in hand with innovation, as it allows finding
new opportunities within materials, resources, systems, and machines i.e., the
technology level. A lot of innovation is received from collaborations with other firms
through information and data sharing (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2020). This can be done
by companies within mature markets as well as new ones, as long as the former type
of company can convince its network of market actors of the benefits of information
sharing and innovation. Despite the benefits, innovations have high rates of failure,
which may scare firms off from focusing on innovation. However, the failures can
often be avoided by not introducing innovations before they are ready, i.e., holding a
good understanding of the market, its actors and how these will react to innovations
(Peters et al., 2020).
The second level by Kindström et al. (2018), the market offer, is about understanding
customers and realizing value, in addition to building up one’s credibility. This level
further highlights the importance of sustainability, as more consumers realize the
current environmental crisis and demand increased sustainability (Dolbec & Fischer,
2015). By applying market-shaping and understanding the market, companies are
forced to increase their technology level and transparently and credibly convey their
sustainability efforts. This level is harder for traditional market actors, as they may be
stuck in focusing on previous customer behaviour and struggle to realize the future
value of sustainability. It may also be hard for a company which previously has not
shown any interest in sustainability to come off as credible or truthful when trying to
increase their sustainability efforts. It may appear ingenuine and as if the company is
only conducting fraudulent marketing strategies such as greenwashing, i.e.,
consciously misleading consumers about the sustainability efforts carried out by the
company (Delmas & Curuel Burbano, 2011). New companies entering markets or

16

creating entirely new markets are more likely to be seen as genuine and transparent as
they are then able to portray their environmental practices from the beginning.
Finally, the third level by Kindström et al. (2018), further supports sustainability and
facilitates for it to become a norm within society and amongst competitors through
performing according to customer demand. By allowing it to become the norm within
society, stakeholders are more likely to genuinely care about the need for the company
not only to portray green actions but also act in accordance with these openly expressed
actions. This is currently not the situation as stakeholders mainly emphasize the need
for the company to communicate their environmental efforts, rather than putting these
into action (Walker & Wan, 2012). This level of market-shaping may not necessarily
be the cause of problems for traditional market actors, as this comes down to their
behaviour. As a traditional actor is expected to be part of a strong and mature market
and network, their waves of change, once created and accepted, might be the cause of
larger norm changes than new challenging market actors. However, new firms are also
able to change societal norms as the other two steps of the market-shaping by
Kindström et al. (2018), maybe easier for these to achieve.
Overall, traditional market actors may meet more challenges than newer actors, as
change and the unknown it brings with it may be too intimidating from both an
economic and organisational point of view. A new business model can appear as highly
un uninteresting to stakeholders at first glance, which market shapers must overcome
(Johnson et al., 2008). New structures can be perceived as daunting and distant by
company employees, or even as a threat to the current structure (Kumar et al. 2000).
That said, it is possible to carry out market-shaping within mature and unsustainable
markets – if the market shaper has the right mindset and technique.

3. Communication efforts for achieving sustainability
through market-shaping
One of the main research questions of this thesis is how companies communicate their
efforts to shape the market to achieve sustainability. Communication heavily affects
how company brands are viewed and perceived by consumers and must therefore be
thoughtfully planned to avoid any misunderstandings or risks. In this chapter of the
theoretical framework, how companies can communicate their sustainability efforts
and why it is important for them to do so will be discussed.

3.1 Consumer brand perception
Brands are often thought of as logos or names but are rather the value that consumers
associate with it (Papista et al. 2018). Because of the consumer perceived value of
brands and the power and influence associated with them, it is essential to know how
to work with brands within the business world (Schroeder, 2009). Company brands
and brand identities can be used as tools for market-shaping (Onyas & Ryan, 2014)
and can be used to e.g., emphasize the importance of sustainability to consumers, B2B
customers and stakeholders alike (Kumar & Christodouloupoulou, 2014). Building on
Lury’s (2009) views, Onyas and Ryan (2014) underline the brand’s role as an essential
component which can alter entire relationships and even change market actors
themselves over time. Therefore, it is imperative for firms wanting to influence the
market to continuously analyse and understand their brand and how its identity can be
changed through e.g., communication to adjust the outward image. Awareness of
current and developing norms concerning e.g., climate change should be especially
valued, and managers should ensure that the company brand reflects these changes
(Ertimur and Coskuner-Balli, 2015).
As stakeholders and policymakers pay increasing attention to the growing
environmental issues, some organisations try to mirror the increasing interest by
reshaping themselves and developing not only an environmentally sustainable
organisation on all levels of the business but also the company brand (Sharma & Joshi,
2019). By pushing forwards and setting new guidelines for the rest of the industry,
companies can lead the way while forcing their competitors to follow in their footsteps.
If organisations are incapable of keeping up with the industry developments and
18

portraying a believable sustainable brand to the public, even top brands will be unable
to remain leaders within their industries (Grant, 2008).
Multiple studies have been carried out regarding social media interaction between
brands and consumers, as well as its effect on consumer brand perception and
consumer behaviour. However, limited research seems to exist on this interaction,
brand perception and consumer intentions in combination with Generation Y,
sustainability, and market-shaping. Consumers’ brand perception is based off the
brand and is mostly not fact-based but rather based on their own and others’
feelings and experiences with the product or service, in addition to word of mouth
(WOM) and eWOM (Tjandra et al., 2013). When trying to assess the quality of a
product, consumers will base it on the brand and their attitudes towards it when they
do not have anything else to go on. Kong et al. (2014) state that consumers’ evaluations
of the brand results in perceptions of the brand, which ultimately affects the
consumers’ intentions to purchase an item or not. These purchase intentions are
improved when companies openly communicate that they are carrying out
sustainability efforts, especially if the consumer in question has a higher awareness of
sustainability. According to Kong et al. (2014), brand attitudes are positively affected
by communicated sustainability efforts and trust is crucial for increasing brand
expectations and to prove that the company conduct is transparent and ethical. The
absence of proper and credible sustainability effort claims which cannot be directly
verified often result in consumers’ perceiving the brand as deceitful and even as
greenwashing.
By reviewing and understanding the consumer’s perception or perceived value of the
company brand, i.e., brand equity, organisations can decide in which direction to
develop and what aspects of the company need to be reconsidered or restructured.
(Lazarevic, 2012). Increased brand equity results in improved customer loyalty and
retention rates. Added focus must be placed on increasing brand equity, as Generation
Y is notorious for being immune to old-school marketing tactics and harder to retain
as loyal customers (Lazarevic, 2012). Targeted and controlled campaigns, as well as
fast feedback and genuine interactions, will help improve consumer brand perception
and overall company growth, and it can be followed up with key performance
indicators such as e.g., Net promoter score, measuring how willing customers are to
recommend the company product or service to others (Raassens & Haans, 2017).
19

Surveys checking in on the consumer perceived brand and potential word of mouth
give insight into individuals’ thought processes and purchase intentions.
Brands’ use of social media creates online brand communities, which also affect
consumer brand perception. These communities enable consumer interactions with the
brand and other consumers on multiple levels, as well as further deepen the customerbrand relationship (Bowen & Ozuem, 2019). The relationship enables companies to
influence consumers more effectively. The community participants are not bound by
any geographical restrictions, which further facilitates the spread of the communities
and the sense of togetherness (Laroche et al. 2012). In-group favouritism (Turner,
2010) causes individuals of the same group to favour objects within the group than of
those outside the group. This can be assumed to be the case for brand communities and
will further establish the group members’ membership and social identity through
brand loyalty. Because of the influence of the communities, companies should not only
create the brand communities but also continuously work on them and provide
additional value for the members and potential consumers.

3.2 Sustainability communication and its risks
When it comes to successful sustainability strategies and market-shaping,
communication and consumer interaction is key. Communication is an essential tool
in everyday life as well as in business management, for all company sizes.
Communication within businesses is used both externally and internally and informs,
motivates, and convinces others, as well as helps create mutual understanding and
encourage cooperation (Genç, 2017). Because of the important role it plays,
communication can make or break a business. Companies must know how their
externally communicated messages are received and perceived by stakeholders (Genç,
2017). The role of communication when trying to achieve a sustainable economy and
market is central, and its goal is to create a shared understanding and ultimately change
stakeholder behaviours (Kim et al., 2018). Research has continuously found that
companies that gather information about the wants and needs of their customers, as
well as respond to these findings through creating and implementing new strategies
that focus on these needs heavily outperform companies that strategize differently

20

(Mena et al. 2019). This should be part of the communication strategy, as the need for
sustainable alternatives become more sought after, especially by younger generations.
Sustainability is not an easy subject to communicate about, and its complexity must be
considered when using it within marketing strategies. The complexity of sustainability
can be described through three dimensions, all three posing challenges which need a
deeper societal communication (Newig et al., 2013). The first dimension is about the
complexity and uncertainty of sustainability. It requires a broadening of the basis of
information and societal values, i.e., how we relate to society through e.g., respect,
justice, and responsibility. The second dimension is about the contradictory goals of
sustainability, with conflicts of interests and values. Communication is needed to
create united goals which can be pursued, and which are of interest to people. The third
dimension highlights the difficulty of governing sustainable development due to so
many involved managing actors on multiple levels of decision-making and the
sustainability goals that are agreed upon are hard to attain due to the difficulty in
implementation. Coordination through networks increases the possibilities of
implementation through social learning and argumentation. By considering these three
dimensions throughout the sustainability communication, it is easier for the company
in question to succeed and create perceived legitimacy and transparency. In addition
to the above-mentioned potential problems regarding sustainability communication,
other risks may arise and must be considered to achieve transparency and credibility.
These are the risks of sustainability communication being perceived as greenwashing
or as unnecessarily provocative. The reason for the latter issue can be conflicts of
interests and values, as mentioned in the second dimension of the contradictory goals
of sustainability by Newig et al. (2013).
When a company is unable or unwilling to change their business to incorporate these
responsibilities due to potential financial short-term losses, yet want to make
consumers believe they have changed, greenwashing arises. As noted in chapter 2.4,
greenwashing, according to the definition by Delmas and Cururel Burbano (2011,
p.66) is “the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a
company (firm-level greenwashing) or the environmental benefits of a product or
service (product-level greenwashing)”. It is a way for the company to portray
themselves as if they are performing better from an environmental point of view than
they are actually doing. It is further possible to divide different environmental
21

strategies according to the company’s environmental performance and the
communication of this performance (Delmas & Curuel Burbano, 2011). The typology
consists of two dimensions: environmental performance (green or brown) and
communication about environmental performance (vocal or silent) with four cells in
total. Companies that are vocal green positively communicate their environmental
performance and the effects of it, while silent green firms do not communicate their
environmental performance. Silent brown firms are signified by not having a good
environmental performance, nor communicating anything about it externally.
Greenwashing companies positively communicate their environmental performance
even though they have bad environmental performance.

Figure 2. Environmental strategies (Delmas & Curuel Burbano, 2011, p.67).

The established trend of sustainability has led to significant growth of sales of green
brands, i.e., brands who actively communicate how their environmental choices differ
from their competitors (Papista et al. 2018). This is of interest for companies wanting
to increase their short-term sales and profit. Greenwashing is ultimately done because
of the potential benefits of carrying and selling green products, despite greenwashing
not producing any positive effects. Research proves that greenwashing only offers
limited benefits and has no actual long-term competitive advantage for those who use
it (De Jong, Harkink & Barth, 2018). In addition to the limited benefits of
greenwashing, Walker & Wan (2012) state that consumers are often able to see through
misleading green company statements and are discontent with the company if these
statements are unsupported and the organisation is not actually taking real actions
22

towards reaching their sustainability goals. However, simultaneously, external
stakeholders emphasize the need for the company to portray green actions to the
market. Whether the company is in fact improving their environmental impact and
performing green actions is not as important (Walker & Wan, 2012). Despite some
consumers being capable of telling when they are being lied to through greenwashing,
it is evident that there is a large gap of consumers’ awareness regarding companies’
overall environmental and ethical impact (Hill & Lee, 2012).
It should, however, be stated that greenwashing is not black and white, and the concept
must be viewed from a wider point of view. Companies looking to make green
contributions and changes in the future or upcoming years may unwillingly use
greenwashing to some extent as they move forward towards real sustainability. The
fast-fashion giant H&M has, since launching its CONSCIOUS collection in 2019,
brought out “sustainable” pieces of clothing, which supposedly are a sustainable
alternative. The collection as well as the company itself were praised by headlines and
stakeholders, claiming it as proof of the company becoming green. The collection has
also received a lot of criticism, naming the collection as an example of greenwashing,
and questioning how these garments could possible even partly undo the damage done
by the rest of the company production process and fast-fashion business model (Petter,
2020).

3.3 Generation Y
This thesis studies the consumer brand perception of Generation Y and how this group
responds to sustainability communication. This age group is relevant as it currently
makes up the largest number of consumers, which in turn make them an increasingly
interesting target group (Taylor, 2018). Knowing this age group better gives an
understanding of how companies should express themselves and communicate to
improve consumer brand perception and behaviour, as well as impacting the rest of the
market. Millennials, having grown up with fast-developing technology, are used to
being surrounded by digital information and communication of all kinds. The constant
accessible information enables Generation Y to be both attentive to and worried about
human- or nature-initiated disasters worldwide (Bhaduri & Ha-Bookshire, 2011). The
generation is highly concerned about the environmental crisis, more so than any
23

previous generations, all the while remaining largely unwilling to look for sustainable
alternatives to products, as this requires effort and is time-consuming (Bhaduri & HaBookshire, 2011).
Generation Y mainly uses social media as a means of communication (Bolton et al.
2013), which means that it is a suitable tool for organisations to engage with the
generation in question. Fashion brands have taken Generation Y’s use of social media
to heart and use it to reach consumers and communicate with them through media
platforms (Bowen & Ozuem, 2019). This strategy is highly effective and successful
and can therefore also be used by sustainability-driven firms when communicating to
this target group about their sustainability efforts.
A study conducted in the US researched Generation Y’s knowledge level of
sustainability within the apparel industry (Hill & Lee, 2012). The findings showed a
distinctly low knowledge level of the industry’s sustainability, as well as the wish for
more educational and transparent marketing campaigns. The study participants stated
the need for businesses to become more transparent in their communication regarding
their sustainability efforts, yet the study also proved that most participants were
positive towards any organisational efforts towards increased sustainability. No matter
the size of the efforts. These results can be compared to the findings of Walker & Wan
(2012), which claim that consumers are mostly capable of finding out whether a
company is carrying out greenwashing and are discontent with companies using
marketing strategies based on this. The general takeaway maybe, that consumers such
as individuals of Generation Y, want to see an increase in sustainable products and
sustainability efforts by companies and have an easier time making greener and more
informed consumption decisions. The generation wants to be able to find out about
easily and quickly whether a product is sustainable or not, without having to spend a
lot of time and effort in researching this.

3.4 Summary of communication efforts for achieving sustainability
The literature and theories which have been discussed in this chapter make up the
second part of this thesis’ theoretical framework. The need for creating a sustainable
economy and market is evident and can be done in different ways. One option for
companies wanting to make a change within their market and influence others to make
24

environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable choices is market-shaping.
Market-shaping is a highly complex concept which is based on the notion that markets
are dynamic and malleable. This means companies can make the market and its
competitors move in a certain direction which benefits the market-shaping company,
without the latter having to adapt to the market. Market-shaping is beneficial to the
initiating market-shaping actor, competitors, and consumers alike.
The need for transparency and credibility is essential when it comes to market-shaping
and communicating the company’s sustainability efforts.

Innovation and

communication are crucial for all companies but are especially important for
companies wanting to conduct market-shaping. Communication can inspire, inform,
and encourage consumers and competitors to think of their own choices and the
organisations they collaborate with or support. When used correctly, communication
can create strong brand communities and reinforce strong consumer brand perception,
which makes the consumers more likely to invest in the market-shaping company’s
products and services, ultimately shaping competitors to take after the market-shaping
firm.

25

4. Methodology
The empirical part of the study is done in the aim of understanding how Swedish
Stockings communicates their market-shaping and sustainability efforts outwards, as
well as evaluating how this communication is perceived by consumers, and how this
perception, in turn, affects the company image. To do so, a multi-qualitative research
design was chosen. In the following chapter, the choice of research method and the
reason behind this choice will be presented. The chapter includes a presentation of the
choice of research method, how the data collection was acquired, how the participants
were chosen and how the data was ultimately analysed. It is concluded in a discussion
of the method’s quality criteria, how these were met and how it differs from a
quantitative research method.

4.1 Choice of research method
When trying to decipher consumers’ actual thoughts on a product, brand or company,
it is crucial to choose the correct research method. In doing so, it is also possible to
decide how to realistically carry out this method (Vogt, 2008). A quantitative research
method would offer some insight into the research subjects’ thoughts, however, would
leave much to the imagination as it would be impossible to follow up with additional
questions to the participants. As there are multiple qualitative research methods to
choose from, the thesis’ needs must be taken into consideration. Individual interviews
would offer a significantly better understanding of the participants’ perception of the
companies than a survey yet would only provide individual opinions. A focus group
offers the advantage of multiple possibly differentiating opinions turning into
discussions and offering new insights and angles to the subjects in question (Eriksson
and Kovalainen, 2008).
The interview with Linn Frisinger, CEO and co-founder of Swedish Stockings, offers
a better understanding of what the company is actively trying to convey through their
communication. This interview is a useful addition to the focus group discussion and
will also be part of the method used to answer the thesis’ research questions. This
results in the use of a multi-qualitative research design. Two trials, so-called pilot
interviews, were conducted before respectively the actual focus group discussions and

26

the company interview were carried out to improve the quality of the two methods as
well as find and prevent any potential misunderstandings or issues.

4.1.1 Pilot interview
Pilot interviews were made before both the focus group discussion and the company
interview based on recommendations by Bryman and Bells’ (2011). These pilot
interviews were made in the aim of discovering any potential issues with either the
technique, focus group manuscript or interview guide. By conducting pilot interviews
prior to the actual focus group or company interviews, the researcher can ensure that
all questions are easily understandable to the participants or interview subjects, as well
as avoid any potential misunderstandings. It further prepares the researcher for
conducting the interview and handle any possibly arising issues.
The pilot interview for the focus groups was held on the 28th of May, on the day of the
first focus group, with a 24-year-old student who fit the focus group participants
characteristics and could give feedback regarding the questions and format of the focus
group manuscript. The interviewee was given access to a portfolio before the pilot
interview, which was referenced in certain questions of the manuscript, and asked to
take 5-10 minutes to go through it. The pilot interview was based on the focus group
manuscript, including an introduction and conclusion, yet followed a semi-structured
form as the same would be done during the actual focus groups. The test resulted in
some recommended changes to certain sentence formulations and behaviour of the
researcher as a focus group moderator. The duration of the pilot interview reflected the
predicted time of 20 minutes and assured that the actual focus groups would take about
1,5 hours.
The Swedish Stockings pilot interview took place on the 12th of May with a 29-yearold interviewee working in digital marketing. The interview was conducted over the
phone as this was also the method in which the company interview was to be carried
out and this helped confirm that the technology and audio recordings were not faulty.
The pilot interview enabled the researcher to predict the time of the actual interview
and edit the questions that were confusing or unclear to the interviewee, all the while
considering how Linn Frisinger at Swedish Stockings would understand them.

27

4.1.2 Focus group
A focus group is defined by Powell and Single (1996: 499) as “a group of individuals
selected and assembled by researchers to discuss and comment on, from personal
experience, the topic that is the subject of the research”. When conducting a focus
group, the researcher encourages group interaction which in turn leads to the
participants engaging in a discussion and answering each other’s questions in addition
to the ones made by the researcher (Eriksson and Kovalainen, 2008).
Eriksson and Kovalainen (2008) explain that focus groups provide a way of connecting
and getting closer to the consumer for marketing researchers. This is done mainly in
the aim of researching consumers perceptions, behaviours, and attitudes towards e.g.,
certain products, communication, and advertisements (Morgan, 1997).
Two focus group discussions were carried out in the aim of answering this thesis’
research questions, one being held on the 28th of May and the other on the 1st of June
2020. Each focus groups consisted of five people. All ten participants are Swedish
speaking Finns between the ages 22-29 and part of Generation Y. All discussions were
done in Swedish which is the mother tongue of all participants. 3 men and 10 women
participated. Because of COVID-19 and the Finnish health recommendations to social
distance. the focus group discussions could not be made in person and instead took
place over Zoom. They were video and audio recorded with the consent of all
participants. The focus group discussion on the 28th of May lasted an hour and a half
and consisted of two men and three women. The second focus group discussion lasted
about an hour and consisted of four women and one man. During both discussions, the
moderator followed the focus group manuscript which had been written prior to the
meetups yet applied a semi-structured interview style with follow-up questions. All
the while, the participants were encouraged to listen to and build on each other’s
opinions while the moderator helped distribute the word.

4.1.3 Portfolio
The portfolio was constructed by the researcher before the focus groups and consisted
of 32 screenshots of images and text posted by Swedish Stockings on their main digital
communication channel with their consumers, i.e., Instagram. The screenshots were
gathered continuously from December 2019 to May 2020 and presented different
28

themes on the company’s Instagram feed and stories during that period. The posts and
themes were chosen with the aim to offer a representative image of the Instagram
account and Swedish Stocking outwards company communication. The screenshots
were presented by theme and accompanied by a short introductory text which gave the
context or necessary information to better understand some of the posts and themes.
The screenshots consisting of both picture and text were in English and the added
introductory text in Swedish, as all participants were fully capable to understand both
languages.
The portfolio was intended to be short enough for the participants to be able to quickly
look over and remember it without studying it for a longer amount of time. The
portfolio was sent to each focus group participant before the discussions and asked to
look over it without purposefully obtaining more knowledge about Swedish Stockings
by googling the company. Before sending out the portfolio, its content was read
through and criticised by a male and female student aged 24 and 26 to test whether all
pictures were understandable and offered an adequate perception of the company in
question.

4.1.4 Choice of focus group participants
Choosing focus group participants is a difficult task, as it forces the researcher not only
to find an opinionated and diverse group of people, but also to remain realistic and to
acknowledge the limitations of e.g., time, availability, and group dynamics (Morgan,
1997). The participants in this research’s two focus groups were chosen based on
certain criteria. These included being Swedish speaking Finns, as Swedish would be
the language used during the focus group discussion to make everyone at ease by
speaking their mother tongue, as well as possess a high level of English as this is the
language used by Swedish Stockings for outwards communication over Instagram, and
therefore also the language making up the portfolio. The previous need for the
participants to be based in Turku to attend the focus groups in person was no longer
necessary since due to the coronavirus, the focus groups were done online instead.
However, the participants still needed to be able to attend the discussions within a twoweek time frame at the end of May or beginning of June for the data to be collected on
time. Other criteria were the participants’ willingness to give up 1 – 1,5 hours of their
29

free time and talk openly about their genuine thoughts and feelings on the subject in
question in front of other discussion group members, as well as preparing for the
discussion by reading the portfolio beforehand. To achieve as a diverse mixture of
answers and opinions as possible, different personality types were chosen as well as
both men and women to ensure a different perspective.
The two focus groups consisted of five participants each, as this was considered a large
enough group to encourage discussion in addition to avoid any confusion which might
arise with a larger number of attendees when discussing online. Had the focus groups
been done in person, a larger number of people would have been asked to participate.
When asked to participate the focus group participants were asked to fill in times when
they would be able to attend in a Doodle, and this was considered when forming the
groups later on. In addition to matching schedules, I also considered the participants’
personalities when forming the groups. I was able to do so since I personally knew the
participants to different degrees before the focus group and therefore also knew how
some individuals usually reacted in different settings and social groups. By considering
their personalities I was able to avoid putting highly extrovert and loud people in the
same group as more soft-spoken and shy individuals, as the latter could end up in the
background without being able to express themselves fully. This resulted in some
participants being friends with other participants of the same group and some being
strangers. This is likely to have had an impact on the way the two focus group
interactions turned out and the opinions which were expressed. This is further
discussed in chapter 3.5.2 Authenticity.

4.1.5 Focus group manuscript
The manuscript for the focus groups, which is found in its entirety in Appendix 1, was
written to offer a structure on which to base the focus group discussions and facilitate
and outline the event for the researcher. The manuscript was tested during the focus
group pilot interview with a 24-year-old student who gave feedback regarding the
questions’ formulations and my conduct as a moderator. The pilot interview
highlighted any problematic sentences or unforeseen potential misunderstandings.
However, as the manuscript was only used as a base for the focus group discussions,
this was also considered during the pilot interview.
30

The manuscript consists of an introduction, participant presentations, followed by
three

themes:

environmental

sustainability,

consumer

perception

through

communication and market-shaping, and is concluded with time for additional
questions and me to thank the participants. All parts have an estimated time duration
which aided in not going over time, however, these were suggestions rather than strict
time restrictions. The manuscript offers a short introduction about the subject, purpose
and aim of the study, asks for the participants’ permission to record them to facilitate
the analysis later as well as ensures that everyone’s thoughts and opinions are equally
interesting. Following this, the themes are introduced and discussed one at a time and
the participants are encouraged to express their thoughts and opinions as well as build
on what has previously been discussed.

4.2 Company interview
An interview was made on the 14th of May 2020 with Linn Frisinger, co-founder and
CEO of Swedish Stockings. The interview was made in the aim of offering further
insight into the company views and whether the communication, brand and image
picked up by the focus group participants reflect what the company is actively trying
to convey. The conversation took place over the phone as this was the preferred
method of Frisinger and was recorded with the permission of the interviewee to
facilitate the transcription and analysis later. The interview lasted about 30 minutes
and was based off an interview guide which had been tested out previously through a
pilot interview. The language used was Swedish as this is both mine and CEO
Frisinger’s mother tongue, and therefore ensured fewer potential misunderstandings
and me being able to pick up on nuances and potentially “hidden” meanings behind
certain sentences. The main questions were sent to Frisinger in advance of the
interview for her to prepare herself beforehand if she wanted to.
The interview guide can be seen in its entirety in Appendix 2 and was used as a support
for the semi-structured interview with Swedish Stockings’ CEO Linn Frisinger. It
allowed for additional follow-up questions based on the answers given by Frisinger.
The questions posed in the interview guide covered the themes market-shaping,
sustainability, and communication within the clothing market in the aim of uncovering
the company’s point of view of these subjects. The guide also brought up less easy and
31

straight-forward questions, which allowed for Frisinger to speculate on what the future
holds if the company does succeed with their market-shaping and the future of
sustainability within the clothing industry. The interview guide and its questions were
tested before the company interview took place, during a pilot interview with an
interviewee knowledgeable within digital marketing.

4.3 Analysis
The analysis was done in multiple steps, from transcribing to coding to analysing the
data. The first step of the analysis was to listen to all three recordings and transcribe
them separately as soon as possible after the recording date to allow for a better
understanding and remembrance of what was discussed and what was meant based on
what was said during the discussions. The audio alone was enough to transcribe the
company interview and both focus group discussions and catch the meaning behind
the sentences said by the participants. Using the video during the discussion groups
was an additional help in facilitating the discussion between participants and to
improve the intimacy yet was not needed during the transcription. I initially intended
to only transcribe the most essential parts of the discussions, yet quickly realized it
would aid in later analysing and coding the content to transcribe everything word by
word. Filling words which did not add anything to the meaning of the sentences were
left out as these were deemed unnecessary. However, filling words which were of any
significance were left in as to not change the intended meaning expressed.
Having transcribed both focus group discussions and the company interview, I started
acquiring a general overview of was said and the meanings behind the words and
sentences which were uttered. I also put together a summary of each respondent’s
attitudes and values. I then compared the two focus groups individual and overall
group answers and perceptions according to each separate question. The coding which
I then initiated, was done in Swedish with some keywords in English, as the interviews
and focus group discussions had been carried out in Swedish. I translated any
quotations needed into English to support and add context to the results.
Potentially affecting factors were considered during the analysis and how this was
visible in the participants’ responses. These factors consisted of the group dynamic,
previous relationships between certain individuals, i.e., friendships or acquaintances
32

and how these relationships showed through the group interactions and willingness to
express differentiating thoughts and opinions in front of strangers or friends. The effect
of gender interaction was also considered. These affecting factors are further discussed
in the following chapter 4.5 Quality Criteria, as well as chapter 5. Analysis, as these
should be considered when presenting the findings of the collected data.
The analysis is a central part of qualitative research, as it ultimately shapes the
research’s results and how these are understood (Flick, 2014). Qualitative data analysis
is especially difficult as there are not any clear guidelines that can be applied to all
research cases. There are two main strategies of analysing qualitative data, despite
there being an array of other lesser-known strategies as well. One way of analysing
data is by using grounded theory and the other is analytic induction (Bryman & Bell,
2011). Analytic induction follows a path of immediately examining the cases or
answers collected during the research to see if they measure up to the hypothetical
explanation. If not, the hypothesis will be reformulated before examining the cases
once again. However, to best apply an analytic induction analysis strategy, there must
be a big enough number of participants present in the data collection (Bryman & Bell,
2011). Grounded theory emphasizes the close connection between data collection, data
analysis and the resulting theories used. The theory is grounded in real data focusing
on a specific case of data. The method and data collection help develop the direction
of theory over time. There are multiple tools which can be applied when using
grounded theory. Many researchers, however, simply decide to use only a few of the
tools all the while still claiming they have applied the concept in its entirety (Locke,
1996). Despite this, grounded theory remains probably the most used strategy for
analysing qualitative data.
One of the tools of grounded theory is coding (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Coding is
described by Strauss (1987 s.25) as indicators being compared against one and other,
followed up by coding them and naming them as indicators for an entire group of
events or behaviours. Bryman and Bell (2011) bring up the three types of coding or
levels of coding compiled by Strauss and Corbin in 1990. These are open coding, axial
coding, and selective coding. Open coding is about breaking down, studying,
comparing, conceptualising, and categorising data, which leaves the researcher with
concepts which can later be grouped according to their themes and reformulated into
different categories. Open coding opens opportunities for interpreting the material
33

more, rather than adding preconceived notions to it. Axial coding is described as a
procedure which is carried out based on open coding but goes further by creating new
connections regarding i.e., as contexts and reasons between categories. Selective
coding focuses on one central category and systematically relate it to the other
categories, further validating these connections and acknowledging categories which
need to be further developed. The central category in question is then seen as the
common thread.
Using coding to analyse qualitative data has been criticised as some argue it heavily
fragments the data and may result in losing the context of what was said. This may be
true; however, it also allows for a clearer overview of the data and an overall improved
analysis (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Discussions have also been made regarding whether
researchers can put their awareness to the side and become entirely objective.
Nowadays it is widely agreed that what researchers see, and study is impacted by other
factors such as what we as humans already know about the social world in which the
study takes place.
I carried out the analysis based on inductive open coding following the abovementioned approach by Strauss and Corbin (1990) together with deductive coding. The
mix resulted in an abductive approach with a focus on the inductive coding, as I had
already read and learnt about important concepts for the thesis such as e.g., marketshaping, which I had in mind while finding themes in the collected data. The coding
itself was done by colour coding the transcribed data using highlighted markers in
different colours, which helped distinguish certain keywords, themes and emotions
uttered by the participants from one another. As I only had access to three colours of
highlighters, the colours represent a different theme in each question, yet still allows
defining similarities and differences amongst the answers. In addition to the colour
coding, I wrote down emotions expressed both explicitly through the choice of words
and indirectly through the tone of voice in the marginals to create a deeper coding. The
coding for the company interview was not colour coded as the answers did not oppose
each other like in the focus group discussions, and so the focus remained on the
keywords and themes found in Frisinger’s answers.

34

Figure 3. Example of colour coding and written coding of the first focus group discussion. Names are
removed to ensure the participants’ anonymity.

Figure 4. Example of coding of the company interview.

35

Based on the coding described above, I categorised all keywords, themes, and
emotions in a separate document. This was done by first summarising each focus group
participant’s thoughts and ideas which helped distinguish the individual opinions of
each participant. I then compiled three lists of the categories and keywords I had found
within each focus group, as well as within the company interview. I placed the lists
next to each other to facilitate a clear overview of the groups’ similarities and
differences. This also enabled me to note whether the company’s intentions brought
up by Frisinger during the interview corresponded with what the focus group
participants experienced based on the portfolio. Comparing the lists showed
distinctions between the groups and how the participants perceived the company and
its way of communicating its sustainability efforts.
The entire coding process was done after the data collection period had finished, rather
than in its midst, as is suggested when conducting grounded theory (Bryman & Bell,
2011). This was due to time restraints, however, it does not have any major effect on
the coding made, as I had the audio from the focus group discussions to rely on, as
well as a clear audio recording of the company interview, which allowed me to analyse
certain emotions expressed through tone of voice or e.g., length of silence before
answering a question.

4.4 Quality criteria
As quantitative and qualitative studies differ heavily from one another, they cannot be
evaluated based on the same type of criteria (Cutcliffe and Mckenna, 1999). Measuring
and acquiring an absolute truth of social reality is impossible and should therefore be
assessed differently than quantitative research. The focus in this thesis, as is common
for qualitative research methods, is on trustworthiness and authenticity, rather than
reliability and validity. Bryman and Bell (2011) present the ideas of Lincoln and Guba
(1985; 1994) to describe both former mentioned concepts. This chapter will further
discuss the meaning of these concepts and how they can be used to assess the quality
of the qualitative research.

4.4.1 Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness can be divided into four criteria, all of which has an equivalent part
of quantitative research (Bryman & Bell, 2011): credibility, transferability,
dependability, and confirmability. Credibility can be established once the researcher
has made certain that the research has been carried out correctly and that the findings
are accurate.
The credibility of this thesis is supported by having multiple people take part in the
focus group discussions, and to have two focus groups. It is further supported by
interviewing the CEO of Swedish Stockings, who can be assumed to be competent and
knowledgeable in her answers. Transferability shows whether the results can say
anything about other contexts, despite that the research has used a limited number of
participants for the data collection. As the research was conducted using Swedish
speaking Finnish participants of two sexes, cis men and women within ages of
Generation Y, transferability may be assumed to keep up within these set limitations.
However, if moved to an international setting on a much larger scale, transferability
cannot be ensured. Generalizability cannot be used as proof of the study’s
trustworthiness, as the small number of focus group participants cannot with certainty
be representative of a much larger population. Dependability is ensured when enough
information is kept and presented, so that future researchers can replicate the study.
This is done through the detailed description of the data collection process in this
methodology chapter and by that all recordings, both audio and video, are saved and
37

accessible. Finally, the confirmability ensures that the research is carried out without
bias or potential personal motivations by the researcher which could affect the analysis
or findings. This is ensured by the researcher not commenting on any of the responses
in the focus group discussion except to clarify and confirm what participants were
communicating. This was further ensured by practising the way of questioning before
conducting the actual focus group discussions and adjusting both the questions and
interaction based on the reactions received during the pilot interview.

4.4.2 Authenticity
The participants were chosen with the attempt to gather and hear as many diverse
opinions as possible. I knew the participants, some on a more friendly level than others,
who were just acquaintances. As I knew the participants to a certain extent, I was aware
of the individuals’ personalities and educational backgrounds before the focus group
discussions. This enabled me to ensure that different viewpoints and characteristics
were represented during both focus groups, as well as varying ages within Generation
Y, and two genders.
I also made sure that the participants were put into groups were some knew each other
from before, and some were strangers. I further assured that the personalities which
were put into the same group did not clash too much and that shyer individuals would
not be overrun by much louder and outspoken participants. I was concerned that people
might be uncomfortable sharing their private views openly in from of others who may
have different opinions. It could even be the case when all participants shared opinions.
This was something I considered when dividing the participants into their groups,
focusing on creating as a diverse and socially comfortable groups as possible. It is
essential to remember that some individuals might express views they think they ought
to have due to others’ reactions, rather than their actual views and opinions. This is
due to social pressure and norms and may indicate that peoples’ real views are either
less or more extreme than what they dare to openly say and discuss.

4.5 Chapter summary
This chapter has covered the thesis’ methodology which was used to obtain answers
to the research questions which were posed in the first chapter of the thesis. Based on
38

the suggestions by Bryman and Bell (2011), the chosen data collection method for the
qualitative case study was a company interview and two focus group discussions with
individuals of Generation Y of ages between 23-29. The chapter discussed the reason
behind choosing this method, as well as how the interview and focus group
manuscripts were written and tried out before the actual event to avoid any
misconceptions and ensure that the answers given were valid and lived up to the quality
criteria. The data collected using the above-mentioned method is presented in the
following chapter 5. Analysis.

39

5. Analysis
The following chapter presents the analysis of the study. Firstly, the focus will be on
the focus group discussion analysis. The two focus groups are discussed based on the
participants’ individual responses, as well as the differences or similarities between
the two groups. The second part of the analysis focuses on the company interview with
Swedish Stockings and how they communicate their efforts to shape the market to
achieve improved sustainability. This is done by analysing the interview made with
CEO and co-founder Linn Frisinger. This is followed up by comparing the results from
the focus groups with the company interview to answer the research questions: How
do companies communicate their efforts to shape the market in order to achieve
sustainability? How do consumers perceive and react to companies’ efforts to shape
markets in this way? All quotes mentioned in the following subchapters have been
personally translated by me from Swedish to English while trying to keep the meaning
and tone behind the original quotations as much as possible.

5.1 Comparing the two focus groups and their participants’ opinions
The analysis of the two focus group discussions was made by going over all individual
participant summaries and organising the answers according to themes, keywords, or
attitudes. The summaries present the essentials of the transcribed collected data and
contain quotations of more detailed thoughts, to further help sustain the idea expressed
by the participant and its context. The participants’ answers varied between the two
groups and within the groups, however, also highlighted multiple similarities. I will
now present these, before finally comparing the participants’ answers to the ones of
CEO Frisinger to answer our research questions.
The first focus group which was organised, hereafter referred to as FG1, consisted of
two men and three women. 2/3 had previously heard about Swedish Stockings before
the focus group discussions yet possessed no deeper knowledge of it. When describing
what affects their decision to buy a product, 3/5 stated that the price was the most
important. The same can be said about the second focus group that was held, i.e., FG2,
which consisted of four women and one man. 4/1 had heard about Swedish Stockings
before but had no further knowledge of the company. FG1 further stated the
importance of material and quality, which only one individual from FG2 agreed upon.
40

The need for the product to fit the participants’ style was only expressed by 2/5 from
FG1 and no one from FG2. 2/5 of the FG1 participants further stated that the brand
was an important factor in their decision to buy a product. This was further emphasized
by 3/5 individuals from FG2, stating that marketing had an impact, but mainly when
there had been negative publicity surrounding the company. One of the FG2
participants noted that marketing only played a role when they had prior knowledge of
the brand, and not when coming across a new one. General sustainability no matter the
product in question was only seen as an important factor for one of the FG1
individuals, yet 4/5 from FG1 and 4/5 from FG2 saw the need for sustainability in e.g.,
food and furniture. One FG2 participant suggesting that this might be due to how food
directly affects the individual themselves and therefore it is important to know about
its production. The same was not said for clothing, the production of which only affect
others and not the purchaser of the garment.
“When it comes to the grocery store, I would take the organic option 9/10 times.
It has to be a very pricy product for me not to take the organic one. But then
when it comes to other products, e.g., clothes, I haven’t done the sustainable
choice. I haven’t thought about how the piece of clothing has been produced or
how large the environmental footprint it has. But if it’s between two types of
milk, I would take the organic one.”
“I think it has to do with that one actually ingests it when it comes to food. Then
it affects oneself quite a lot.”

It seems as if people believe that the clothing industry’s production does not heavily
affect them personally. However, this is not true, as it does impact all the world’s
inhabitants through its pollution and use of resources. It may not feel like it to most,
as the consequences are not as directly visible as when e.g., ingesting heavily pesticide
covered food.
The importance of sustainability when deciding upon whether to purchase an item was
further explored by asking whether the participants would be willing to pay more for
sustainable products, and if so, how much. The answers ranged from yes, but that it is
hard to distinguish whether a product is sustainable and that it is affected by the
individual’s current economy, to no, not for clothes but food. The overall opinion
seemingly being that they are willing to pay somewhat more for a sustainable product,
but a rather small amount.
41

When asked about the overall impression of Swedish Stockings, based on the portfolio
I had sent them showing a wide range of the company’s outwards communication, the
two groups differed from each other. From FG1, 2/5 expressed a positive impression
of the company, while the other 3/5 stated having gained a negative opinion. The
positive opinions were based on the company having a great business idea and bringing
up important themes, as well as the business being attentive to the current
environmental needs. The negative opinions questioned the intense focus on
sustainability, confusion about the brand, and the provocative marketing campaign
“This is us – this is them”:
“Is it their only identity that they’re sustainable or what? Can’t they do
something else too?”
“I was a bit confused about the tables which suddenly came up. The fact that
they make tables is so far away from their name. What company is this? Are
they a clothing company or do they sell furniture? It feels confusing. I feel very
sceptical of this. It all sounds great, but my first thought was that I believe that
if I’d look into them a little bit more, I would find something bad about them.
Also provocative with these pictures “This is us – this is them”, cause I don’t
think that’s them – that they’re so clean nature and the others are that horrible.”

However, in FG2, all participants stated they had received a positive impression based
on the portfolio. The overall opinion being that Swedish Stockings are transparent,
genuine, and innovative:
“It seems as if they actually want to inform and not just sell. It seems as if they
genuinely care”.
“It was positive overall. The environmental aspect regarding the plastic and
colouring seems especially good.”
“I’m a person that really likes these types of things – companies which have
thought outside the box when it comes to reusing and recycling things. I
would’ve never come up with the idea of creating tables out of hosiery. That
there’s a way of reusing wasteful products, that is really nice! A positive for
me!”

When questioned whether the participants would be interested in hearing more about
the company and its products or business model, the two groups differed in the same
way as above. Once again, all five FG2 participants, including one man, were
interested in learning more about the company. In FG1, only 2/5 were interested in
42

learning more, none of which were men. The two men of the group both stated that
they had no interest in the company at all, mainly due to it producing mainly womenworn products. However, it should be noted that one of the men participating had said
that he had received an overall positive impression of the company but later stated that
he had no further interest in it. The opposite can be said about one of the women
participating, who previously stated having gained a negative perception of Swedish
Stockings yet was interested in learning more about the company and its business
model:
“Overall, I think it’s super interesting that they’re doing circular economy. I
think it’s really interesting as a business model to think about how to make it
work with other raw materials. Super interesting idea, but I think they have a
problem with their name being “Stockings”, I think people get stuck there […]
I will definitely go google them more after this.”

The participants were further asked whether Swedish Stockings stands out amongst its
competitors such as Wolford, H&M and Lindex. All FG1 participants agreed that the
company does stand out and accredited this to the lack of only product focus, the
environmental aspect, the company values, as well as interest in style and choice of
pictures. 3/5 FG2 participants agreed with FG1 and stated that Swedish Stockings
stands out mainly thanks to the environmental aspect and its values. 2/5 of FG2 were
unsure whether the company stood out as they felt they lacked in knowledge of the
overall stockings industry.
When discussing what the company wants to accomplish with their communication,
both focus groups gave various answers. In FG1, 2/5 stated that they thought the
company’s communication wanted to gain more customers and potentially encourage
consumerism. 2/5 of FG1 similarly thought the company was looking to find more
customers yet emphasised the company’s desire to find customers with similar values
and opinions. 1/5 thought the main goal was to gain visibility by provoking and
initiating drama with competitors. As for FG2, 3/5 participants mainly thought the
communication was done to inform consumers and encourage critical thinking while
acknowledging the company’s desire to find and gain customers with similar values.
1/5 also suggested that the communication is a way to inspire competitors to change
their ways, i.e., encourage market-shaping:

43

“It said that they are transparent regarding their production. Maybe they are this
to inspire other companies. It can be something which ultimately makes people
wanting to buy their products, knowing how they have been produced from start
to finish.”
“I don’t really get the image that they’re trying to sell a lot, it seems as if they
rather want to make you aware. Of course, they still do try to sell their products,
but it’s nothing which can be seen in their marketing I think.”
“I think they want to make people more aware of the choices they’re making.
But it also seems as if they want to make people realize that it doesn’t have to
be really hard to do something on your own for the environment.”

One of the campaigns shown in the portfolio consisted of pictures of a tranquil lake
and surrounding trees or a serene sea of jellyfishes, accompanied by the statement
“This is us”, followed by pictures of clouds of dark factory emissions and plastic
polluted water with the words “This is them”. This campaign was the most polarizing
that could be found from Swedish Stockings’ communication at the time of the focus
group discussions and was discussed by the participants. Once again, the two groups
had opposing opinions on the matter, as 5/5 of FG1’s participants said they found it to
be negative and unnecessarily provoking and or polarising, while 3/5 of FG2’s
participants found it to be provoking yet positive and 2/5 thought it was provoking but
personally remained emotionally untouched by the campaign. FG1 participants
brought up how they think it is a PR trick to become more famous and increase sales,
showing superiority complex, being problematic and irritating:
“I think they’re trying to create drama and become famous as many are doing
nowadays, to end up in the news … If they find another great way of bringing
this forward, without saying ‘look, we’re better than you’ from a different
perspective it would be more fun”.
“I agree, they achieve nothing by stomping down on others to prove that they’re
better. They could just as easily show their good sides and then these aware
customers would understand that this is good for the circular economy, without
having to show it through some kind of superiority complex”.
“I have a problem with this. I think it’s very polarising and something I think
we should move away from, putting things in groups. Even though they might
be environmentally aware, nobody is ever perfect. Everyone can always strive
for something better. Rather than being like ‘You’re the bad guy, we’re the good

44

guy’, it’s about who has a will, who is trying to move forward. I don’t like this
at all, it’s very off-putting and unnecessarily polarising.”

Only 1/3 of the FG2 participants who found the campaign to be provoking positively
manner, stated that it was on the verge of crossing the line.
“Strong pictures, I think! Maybe a little bit too much, but I don’t think the
pictures really say that much”.

The overall impression of the campaign from FG1 was that it gave a negative
perception of the company brand and multiple participants claimed the campaign could
have been improved by using solely the pictures with the text “This is us” while leaving
out the comparison with competitors. Many of the participants agreed that the
campaign made it seem as if Swedish Stockings thought of themselves as above others,
described by one as an example of “superiority complex”. The negative perception of
the campaign might be a consequence of group dynamics, as even the individuals who
had previously expressed that they had a positive perception of the company saw it as
negative. FG2 agreed that it was either positive or not heavily affecting them
personally, as they experienced the information given through the campaign to be fact,
and therefore informative rather than accusative.
“I believe they’re there to provoke the competition. It’s not like it’s super
aggressive. I think it’s a good thing to bring forward, but I think it may be a bit
provoking towards the competition, but at the same time, this is what it’s like.
There’s nothing they can hide behind.”
“I also think it’s a bit provocative, but I also think it’s positive, because it makes
you want to click through and read about who ‘Us’ and ‘Them’ are. I don’t
know, I wasn’t provoked myself. It was more curiosity for me.”

Following the campaign discussion, the participants were asked whether Swedish
Stockings are trying to change the market and if so, whether they are likely to succeed.
3/5 individuals from FG1, as well as 5/5 from FG2, agreed that the company is trying
to change the market and inspire competitors.
“I think they’re trying to initiate change within the consumer society and
encourage to reuse something rather than throwing it away when you’re tired of
it. I partly think it’s about information and partly inspiration. When it comes to
creating something new out of something broken or is no longer used instead of
throwing it out, it’s probably mainly directed at competitors.”

45

“Yes, I’d say they’re trying to change the industry based on the pictures. They
not only say that they are sustainable, but they also show in what way they are.
I think they mainly want to change the customer behaviour – ‘buy from us cause
this is how we do it’.”
“I think they’re trying to change both consumers and competitors. Inspire was a
good word for it.”

However, some stated that it would only be possible for Swedish Stockings to inspire
smaller companies, while others thought it would be possible to change also bigger
companies if Swedish Stockings are first able to change the general consumer
behaviour within the business and thus force companies to follow in the footsteps of
sustainability thinking.
“I was going to say that they can surely also affect bigger companies if they get
enough customers to change their minds. Because then bigger companies will
also be under pressure to change. So yes, I definitely think they’re able to cause
change.”
“I agree about the customers, that if they can change them and make them more
aware, then the customers will also start asking other companies how their
products are produced. More aware customers will demand change from bigger
companies.”

This supports the idea that consumers are aware of if a company is trying to change
the market to e.g. make it more sustainable. 2/5 from FG1 disagreed with the company
wanting to initiate change, and one of the two even stated that he thinks they only aim
to provoke to increase visibility and gain more customers, rather than shaping the
market:
“I think they’re only trying to provoke people to receive more attention, but I
think they do it in a bad way, in my opinion.”

From FG1, 2/5 believed that Swedish Stockings will be able to affect other companies,
however, one of the two claimed that only the use of materials would be replicated by
competitors, and not the brand nor external communication. 2/5 assumed that the
company will not succeed in changing the business unless Swedish Stockings
increases in size and thereby also in influence capacity. 1/5 from FG2 believed that the
company would be able to initiate change within other companies, but only smaller
ones, also due to the size and influencing ability of Swedish Stockings. 4/5 from FG2

46

agreed that Swedish Stockings will be able to create change within both bigger and
smaller competitors, by initiating change within consumer behaviour.
Finally, the focus groups were asked to discuss a potential future scenario and whether
it would be positive or negative for Swedish Stockings if competitors were to follow
their lead and start producing stockings in a similar sustainable way. FG1 and FG2
showed similar results, with 1/5 from each group stating that it would be positive for
the company, 3/5 from both groups assuming it would have a negative effect and
finally 1/5 from each group remaining unsure of the outcome.
“I think it may be hard because then they’d definitely have to change their prices.
But it could be that they’re then seen as some kind of precursor and that people
still want to continue buying from them because of that. But it may be hard.”
“Then you have to be innovative and continuously make the entire process
greener. There would be competitive prices if everyone starts producing in the
same way. But at the same time, you want all the employees to get a proper
salary. Maybe it’s rather about making the entire production process greener and
be even more transparent.”
“It will probably become very hard if everyone has the same production
procedure, then it’d be a lot about what or with whom the brand is associated
with. In such a world they would probably have to be associated with influencers
or people who have a large number of followers. They’d have to invest in a
person that inspires others.”

An explanation for it being both a positive and negative situation for Swedish
Stockings was how the price would have to or could be reduced. Some individuals saw
it as a positive for the company to be able to lower the prices as this would lead to
them being more competitive on that aspect, while others saw it as a nuisance for the
company which would probably lead to more problems than solutions for the market
actor. The company was expected to survive the above-mentioned scenario if they
would have created a strong enough loyal customer base by then, as well as remain
leading regarding innovations and quality within the industry.
“If the big market actors would copy Swedish Stockings, then all the oceans
would probably run out of plastics, and that is the end goal. But then Swedish
Stockings must […] already have a well-established customer base. If they have
a very stable one, they can surely survive, they just have to come up with another
idea.”

47

“I think it would come down to the quality. I already think about that a lot when
I buy clothes – quality. I don’t really think so much about the sustainability in
itself, but rather how long I can use a piece of clothing and how good the material
is. If one thinks about the durability, one often thinks that it’s good clothing. I
think it’ll come down to that in the future – the quality.”

Figure 6 offers an overview of the opinions expressed by the two groups and how these
compare to the intentions of Swedish Stockings as expressed by Frisinger.

5.2 Analysing the interview with Linn Frisinger
When asked to describe Swedish Stockings in her own words, Frisinger stated the
following:
“…we are the world’s only sustainable hosiery brand, and
what we do, or our vision has from the beginning been to change and
influence the hosiery industry. We do that by e.g., producing everything we
do from recycled material or different types of natural fibres. And above all
sustainability for us is to look at the entire cycle so to say. So that everything
from material to how we produce packaging, and of course transports, but
also and maybe mainly our recycling program and what we actually do with
the products once they have been used up as well”.

Frisinger claims that Swedish Stockings are the only sustainable hosiery brand
worldwide at the moment of the interview. The reason why the company exists, as well
as what they want to do is also evident. Swedish Stockings want to create change and
influence its competitors to become more sustainable and leading by example. This is
done through transparency and incorporating the sustainability mindset in all parts of
the production process, as well as what is done to the product post-production.
Additionally, the company collaborates with competitors to encourage a new way of
production, engages in social issues, and increases visibility by focusing on
communication.
Swedish Stockings main product is, at the time of writing and publishing this thesis,
stockings. However, recently socks have also grown to become highly important for
the company, and new products such as leggings, bike shorts and even furniture have
now been introduced. That said, these products are not yet even remotely as important
as the before mentioned stockings and socks. When asked about the company’s main
48

target group, Frisinger explains that it consists of informed women, mainly in urban
areas, however, she adds that being informed is not confined to any age restrictions in
the end. The consumers do not necessarily have to be informed about the state of the
environment, sustainability, or fashion, as one can be informed in multiple different
ways. Frisinger does ultimately state that their prime age group is between 25-45 years
old, and averages at 35.
Swedish Stockings’ competitors are, according to Frisinger, all companies who
produce and sell hosiery. This includes fashion giants such as H&M and Wolford.
However, she also notes that there still is not any real clear competition, as no
companies that produce the same way and hold the same values exist yet. Instead, the
competition is made up of companies where customers who are not informed go to
purchase their stockings, i.e. to the fashion giants.
Sustainability is a key concept in all parts of the circle of life of the product at Swedish
Stockings. Frisinger says that there is a lot of talking about materials, but that the
production process itself and its emissions are often forgotten about. At Swedish
Stockings, Frisinger claims both the production process and the material used are
thought about, as well as what happens once the product has been used up.
“…our recycling program has become highly important. We pay a lot of
attention to how to think outside the box and achieve a more innovative and
sustainable development moving forward”.

Regarding the importance of innovation for the company, Frisinger says it is crucial
as this is the only way they will be able to follow their vision and change and influence
the entire stockings industry. The goal is to have as many companies as possible
producing hosiery the same way Swedish Stockings do, all the while remaining in the
lead of the competition regarding new materials and innovation. One of their newest
innovations is making tables out of old broken stockings people send them.
Communication with customers and competitors alike is an essential part of expressing
the company vision and initiating change within the industry. The communication
strategy at Swedish Stockings is permeated by transparency. The goal is to be highly
transparent in everything they do and openly communicate about how they work and
produce their products. Transparency, Frisinger says, is also visible by openly talking
about how Swedish Stockings cannot do everything, despite claiming to be the only
49

sustainable hosiery brand worldwide. Even for them, it is simply not always possible
to do things in the best way possible, or how the company wishes they could have done
things. On social media, the communication strategy also shows proof of transparency,
however, focuses on being a bit more personal. Frisinger says that they aim to be seen
as a person or friend people would like to spend time with. Their Instagram should
show off a bit of the company’s heart and soul, which is something they have seen
consumers ask for from brands. Being its “own person” on social media also means
that Swedish Stockings can show off a multitude of characteristics and not be confined
to just fashion or a single theme, Frisinger says. This is evident in the multitude of
subjects the company covers in their communication, from supporting the nurses and
doctors during COVID-19 with free products to celebrating the first-ever US woman
Vice President-elect. Furthermore, the communication strategy focuses on other ways
of improving visibility and how to spread and share the knowledge acquired for the
company’s production process and mindset. This is done through somewhat surprising
design collaborations with e.g. fashion companies Ganni and Filippa K, despite the
two not being so-called sustainable organisations:
“We partly want to show that we can be ahead when it comes to research and
innovation, but at the same time, we can do design collaborations with Ganni
and lie at the forefront regarding design. We believe that combination is
essential to be an interesting brand or an interesting person that people want to
hang out with.”

Swedish Stockings may not have a strong community on Instagram yet, however, this
is something they are continuously trying to develop. They aim to do so by increasing
their consumer interactions, as well as meticulously planning the posts and campaigns
which are run on the platform, Frisinger explains. The focus is not only on the products
but also on other issues that are important to the company, which in turn adds to the
company brand image. The themes brought up in their posts encourages the viewer to
become more informed about and potentially help in social and environmental issues
such as Covid-19, the Australian bushfires or whether a company is greenwashing.
One of the campaigns was made to encourage customer’s critical thinking and create
a discussion, as well as choosing Swedish Stockings above other less sustainable
manufactures. I refer to it as “This is us – this is them”, simply due to the text placed
on the photos of the campaign. The campaign portrays Swedish Stockings as a
company that should be associated with clear lakes, serene landscapes, and healthy
50

marine life while opposing companies create heavy emissions and pollution. When
asked about the posts in question, Frisinger says it was part of their communication
strategy to clearly show customers what they and their competitors do.
“Communication in essence is about simplicity. It’s the key to everything, so we
did them [the posts] to keep it as simple as possible. And it hasn’t been received
negatively at all, nobody has commented that it wouldn’t be true etc., and that’s
because it is. We are the only ones who make [hosiery] this way. […] We want
others to come and ask us about it – how do we do it? How can we produce the
same way?”

When asked whether campaigns such as the above-mentioned is created in the hope of
engaging competitors, Frisinger replies affirmatively and makes a comparison to
another market-shaping company within the automobile market.
“We usually say we’re like Tesla. Tesla’s vision was obviously to stir the
automobile industry and now one can say that everyone who doesn’t have a
Tesla – or there are of course downsides to Teslas as well, it has been proven –
but it turned into everyone who doesn’t own a Tesla has an environmentally
destructive car. […] Tesla has basically stopped now; they’ve done what they
needed to do. And everyone who does anything similar [within the car industry]
in the future will just be a copy of Tesla. But that’s great because that’s what
Tesla wants. We think similarly, but when it comes to stockings.”

Inspired by Tesla, Swedish Stockings want to inspire other companies to follow their
way of manufacturing. According to Frisinger, they have already started to see small
changes. One of their previous collaboration partners, Filippa K, have started
producing stockings in a similar way, and other competitors such as Wolford and Falke
have also started doing so. Despite wishing the competitors would take advantage of
Swedish Stockings’ transparency and particular know-how, they have only done so
partly, which is something Frisinger hopes to see a change in in the future.
Regarding seeing a change in consumer behaviour, they have noticed an overall
increase in interest for sustainability since Swedish Stockings entered the market in
2016, which has led to an increase in demand for such products. Frisinger herself
believes that Swedish Stockings have played a part of the sustainability mindset
development within the world of stockings.
“For us, it has been about making consumers aware of that this [stockings]
is a petroleum product, because almost nobody knows about it, so that has

51

almost been the foundation. And I think we’ve succeeded doing that because
there are quite a lot of people that have realised that ‘oh, this product is
actually made out of oil’, and one hasn’t thought about it before. We’re
starting to awaken this. Sustainability overall has proceeded a lot since we
entered [the market], and there’s now a lot more demand for such products.
But I absolutely think there have been a lot of changes, and I think we’ve
been a part of this within the hosiery industry.”

When speaking about the future of the industry, Frisinger says she believes that it will
move towards only using recycled material as well as obliterating the need for using
oil, especially raw oil, when producing stockings. She does not see it as a negative if
all competitors replicate Swedish Stockings’ entire manufacturing process, but rather
as a positive, as long as they can remain known as the originals, similarly to Tesla. She
further emphasises the need for innovation within their company, stating that they may
produce any stockings at all in the future, but rather only focus on recycling old broken
stockings and remaking them into new objects. There will be a need for this as long as
there is a need for stockings, as stockings are impossible to make unbreakable.
Ultimately, Frisinger is asked about the sustainability of companies and capitalism in
general. She does not believe we will move away from consumption, and that the focus
should rather be on changing the way we consume and how those things are produced:
“A company can be [sustainable]. But I don’t know if I can say that Swedish
Stockings as a company can ever be entirely that. The problem will not be the
material, but the production in itself. We get that question a lot – that shouldn’t
one rather avoid buying hosiery all together then – but we still believe that the
way forward isn’t about prohibitions or that you should be punished for buying
a certain product, or not to consume at all. Because I don’t think that’s the way
it’s heading, but rather that we’ll continue to consume also after this Corona
crisis. It’s about how we need to start consuming in a different way.”

She further explains her view on the importance of being able to show flaws within a
company, and that it is okay not to be 100% perfectly sustainable. The focus, according
to Frisinger, should be on making efforts for the better and constantly improving all
parts of the company, without being scrutinized for the parts that still need to be
worked upon.
Swedish Stockings part is to inspire and lead within innovation, despite not ever being
able to achieve completely zero emissions, says Frisinger. This, however, somewhat
52

goes against what was expressed through Swedish Stockings’ campaign “This is us –
this is them”, which compared Swedish Stockings and their production to their
competitors. One may argue that this campaign criticised companies that are not yet
great concerning their sustainability, which Frisinger herself expresses is problematic
and makes companies less willing to share their sustainability efforts. However,
Swedish Stockings may also only mean companies who are not carrying out any
sustainability actions whatsoever in their campaign. There is nothing to clearly state
which companies they were talking about in the campaign.

5.3 Focus group and company interview comparison
Having examined the opinions of the individuals of the two focus groups and the
described intentions of Swedish Stockings’ vision and external communication
according to Frisinger, both dissimilarities and similarities are found. These will now
be summarised.
Based on the visuals and text in the portfolio, the focus group participants mainly
expressed positive perceptions of Swedish Stockings. This was especially true for FG2
where all participants agreed having received a positive perception of the company.
The general agreement of the group might be due to it holding more personalities
matching the characteristics of the company’s target group than FG1. Frisinger
describes their target group to mainly consist of women aged 25-45 years, mostly
living in bigger cities than in the countryside and being aware, including but not solely
within sustainability and fashion. FG2 holds multiple individuals fitting these
characteristics, especially aware within the ethics of fast-fashion and sustainability.
The majority of the participants thought Swedish Stockings stands out amongst its
competitors and attributed this to the very clear company values, the lack of solely
focusing on the product in addition to themes such as transparency, genuineness and
innovation. None of the participants’ mentioned design when speaking about the
company, which opposes the thoughts expressed by Frisinger. The CEO clearly states
that they want to be at the forefront when it comes to design and that this was also the
reasoning behind collaborating with Ganni. This discrepancy may, however, be due to
the design aspect not being highlighted enough in the portfolio the participants were
given. A majority of the FG1 participants further described Swedish Stockings as
53

“preachy” or portraying a “superiority complex”. The latter description was said
concerning the marketing campaign “This is us – this is them”. The campaign, which
Frisinger stated had not received any critical or negative responses, was met negatively
by all five FG1 participants, and one FG2 participant stating that it was on the verge
of being too much. The FG1 participants expressed how it was not in line with the
company’s values, was provocative, polarising and not transparent enough – with one
participant stating that she did not believe that the campaign’s content was accurate.
3/5 FG2 participants did see the campaign as positive, with the remaining two
remaining neutral to it which is also not good. It appears as if the campaign mainly
received a negative response by the focus groups of this study. The fact that FG1
obtained a more negative perception of the campaign than FG2 may be due to the
differences in ages between the groups, or the result of having two men in FG1. One
may also question, however, whether this could be down to cultural differences
between Swedish and Swedish speaking Finnish mindsets.
The company’s vision of wanting to change the hosiery industry, Frisinger believes, is
evident through the company’s communication. She appears correct, as all but two
participants state that they do believe that the company is trying to shape the market
and initiate change. The remaining two participants do not see the attempted marketshaping, but rather attribute the behaviour to a publicity stunt for increased visibility
or view the business plan and brand to be too simple for such a difficult task. The focus
group participants mainly agree that to succeed with shaping the market, Swedish
Stockings must also change consumer behaviour and its associated product demand.
The company should also focus on becoming known as the original of sustainable
hosiery and thereby establish a strong customer base which will remain loyal to the
company even if or when competitors offer cheaper alternatives. Frisinger claims she
has already seen proof that the consumer behaviour is changing, having noticed
switches towards a more sustainable thinking and an increasing demand for greener
products. She also believes that Swedish Stockings have been part of initiating that
change. She further agrees with the focus group participants’ concerning the
importance of being remembered as the original, comparing her company to Tesla.
Finally, the group participants mainly agreed that carrying out market-shaping would
result in negative consequences for Swedish Stockings. The repercussions would be
due to the company losing its competitive edge and not being able to adapt to
54

competitors’ prices. Frisinger disagrees with the participants, explaining that as long
as the company is remembered as the original, they may move onto producing other
products than hosiery. One option would be to focus entirely on the company’s
recycling club and solely create new products made from old and ripped stockings
instead of them ending up in landfills. Swedish Stockings, Frisinger says, is present on
the market to inspire, not provoke.

6. Results
The following chapter makes up the results of the thesis. The data I collected and
analysed in the previous chapter will now be compared with the theories discussed in
the theoretical framework. This comparison culminates in results which can be used
for managerial implications or support future research, but mainly aims to answer the
thesis’ research questions:
•

How do companies communicate their efforts to shape the market to achieve
sustainability?

•

How do consumers within Generation Y perceive and react to companies’
efforts to shape markets in this way?

•

How is Generation Y’s perception of sustainability communication described
in scientific research?

The main themes mirror the ones mentioned in both the theoretical framework and
analysis, i.e., market-shaping, communication, and consumer perception concerning
sustainability. The results present an interconnection between the subjects, as well as
provides evidence of how Swedish Stockings’ communication and market-shaping
intentions are perceived by Generation Y. The themes will be presented and
highlighted using translated quotes from the company interview and focus group
discussions.

6.1 Market-shaping efforts and how companies communicate them
In the theoretical framework, the ways in which companies can carry out marketshaping to achieve sustainability and communicate this was discussed. The ideas of
Storbacka and Nenonen (2020) were presented, but since several of the 8 steps appear
targeted towards firms contemplating whether to initiate or take part in the marketshaping process, whereas Swedish Stockings have already chosen to take action, the
suggestions by Kindström et al. (2018) were chosen. The answer to the research
question: How do companies communicate their efforts to shape the market to achieve
sustainability?, is explained in this chapter by comparing the three levels of Kindström
et al. (2018) and the statements given by Frisinger in the company interview.

56

Market-shaping is a highly complex concept and managers must be aware of how the
market is dynamic and ever-evolving rather than a stable structure. Firms must acquire
and uphold a deep understanding of markets and how these can be changed (Beninger
& Francis, 2020). They must also be able to remain dynamic in response to external
threats such as e.g., climate change. By doing so, threats can transform into
competitive advantages through innovation and technical progress. It is evident from
the interview with Frisinger that Swedish Stockings have a deep understanding of
market-shaping and how they conduct it. Market-shaping is part of the company’s
vision and has been a core element since the beginning, as “changing and influencing
the stockings’ industry” has always been the aim of the company according to
Frisinger. Swedish Stockings have also understood that climate change and the
restrictions it brings, can be turned on its head and become an advantage and source
of innovation. They were able to enter the market as late as 2016 and still become
successful by making the market move in a more sustainable direction and thus not
have to adapt to the market (Baker et al., 2019). They try to change the market and
make it sustainable through their way of product manufacturing, choice of material,
transparency, communication, and collaborations. Frisinger stating the importance of
collaborations and communication to change and/or influence the stockings’ industry
shows an understanding of the basics of market-shaping and its associated actor
activities and collaborations (Nenonen et al., 2019; Baker & Nenonen, 2020).
As innovation and market-shaping are heavily affected by one another, companies who
are market leaders within innovation are usually also market-shaping leaders and
decide the direction in which the market develops (Kumar et al., 2000). Frisinger
emphasized the importance of innovation for the company by saying that the only way
to change and influence the industry is by “constantly remaining in the lead when it
comes to research and innovation”.
According to Kindström et al. (2018), the system level is about building legitimacy
and incorporates the following three activities: changing norms, infusing knowledge,
and boosting demand. When asked whether the consumer behaviour has changed,
Frisinger believes that it has, and that Swedish Stockings have been successful in
informing consumers of the negatives of hosiery as well as how it can be produced in
a more sustainable way. Based on Frisinger’s statements, it appears as if Swedish
Stockings have been a part of boosting demand, informing consumers, and changing
57

norms within their industry. Frisinger stating seeing a change in consumer behaviour,
i.e., changing norms is not evident within the focus groups. Even so, this does not
necessarily disprove Frisinger’s observations, as the demand for sustainable products
and alternatives have noticeably generally increased in demand.
The second level by Kindström et al. (2018) aims to authenticate the market offer and
consists of the following three activities: realizing value, understanding customers, and
building credibility. Realizing value is referring to the firm’s ability to make the
customer aware of the benefits in the offer and for the company to become a unique
supplier for the customer. Swedish Stockings officially single themselves out from
competitors by stating that they are “the only sustainable hosiery brand worldwide”
and provide information about the industry as well as current events worldwide which
either affect the environment or specific social issues like feminism. The information
provides additional value to the consumers, as it allows the consumer to see how their
products have been made and how the company they choose to support gives back to
the community. This is further supported by the level activity of building credibility,
which calls for presenting the supply chain’s trustworthiness and ability as well as by
explaining the propositions of added value which are achieved using new technology
(Kindström et al. 2018). Both activities are carried out by Swedish Stockings, as they
openly show where, how and by whom their products are made, as well as how their
recycling production enables the company to create new products such as furniture.
The added value which is achieved by using new technology is proven by the company
through collaborations with companies to show the way of using the technology:
“So we’ve been open to showing other brands how we produce, and that they can do it
the same way. Filippa K started doing some things the same way as we have been
doing.”

The third level by Kindström et al. (2018) which suggests how companies should
conduct market-shaping is about technology and how to demonstrate it through
replicating processes, building application knowledge and co-developing technology.
Carrying out activities on this level results in deeper relationships with customers and
simplifies development as well as helps increase customers understanding of the
technology. This can also be done on social media where consumers can give feedback
about the products as well as receive information which explains the production
process and its benefits in detail. The third level may also lead to co-developing
58

technology with consumers; however, this does not appear to have happened yet within
Swedish Stockings. Partnerships with external experts is another consequence of this
level and have been done on multiple occasions by the firm. Swedish Stockings have
partnered with design-focused Ganni, Filippa K, as well as a furniture designer for
creating tables out of old and broken stockings.
Sustainability has been present from the very beginning for Swedish Stockings. It is
something that can be seen in every level of the supply chain and production process,
all the way to after the stockings have been used and broken. Some may claim that a
product which breaks cannot be sustainable, nonetheless, the company continuously
claims to be the only sustainable hosiery brand worldwide. When asked about what
sustainability means for Swedish Stockings during the company interview, Frisinger
responded that “it is about looking into the entire life cycle of the product, from
beginning to end”. The brand communication done by Swedish Stockings is based off
sustainability but also covers multiple other subjects. It follows a communication
strategy and is planned on both a long and short-term basis where the content is based
around the idea of Swedish Stockings being an individual, or a friend, rather than a
company:
“We usually look at Swedish Stockings as a person. We want to be perceived as
a person that you want to spend time with. That means being able to have
multiple sides to oneself. Partly by showing that we can be ahead of the game
when it comes to research and innovation, while simultaneously collaborating
with Ganni and be a frontrunner when it comes to design.”

6.2 Generation Y consumers’ perception of market-shaping efforts
Having gone over the first research question and its answer above, the following two
research questions will be covered. The way in which Generation Y’s perception of
sustainability communication is described in previous research and how consumers of
Generation Y perceive and react to companies’ efforts to shape the market will now
be presented.
Generation Y is more aware of and worried about the environmental crisis than any
other generation before them. Despite their concern, the generation is largely unwilling
to put effort into researching sustainable alternatives to products and want to have all
59

information easily and directly communicated to them (Bhaduri & Ha-Bookshire,
2011). Consumers of Generation Y are critical to information due to years of receiving
it through multiple channels having access to it on a much bigger scale than ever
before. They are known for not responding well to old-school marketing and respond
better to targeted and controlled campaigns, in addition to fast feedback and genuine
interactions. The use of social media is crucial when communicating about
sustainability with Generation Y, as online brand communities affect consumer brand
perception and deepens the customer-brand relationship (Bowen & Ozuem, 2019).
Following up with surveys on the consumer brand perception and WOM are also
effective.
The focus group participants’ perceptions of Swedish Stockings’ communicated
market-shaping efforts varied. It was evident that some of the communication
expressed by the company was received in the way it was intended, while some of it
was not. The participants’ general opinion was that sustainability is important and
impacts the purchase decision when it comes to food and furniture. They did not,
however, consider sustainability within clothing purchases to be important as it e.g.,
takes too much effort to research which clothing company is genuinely green.
The activities carried out by Swedish Stockings and suggested by Kindström et al.
(2018)’s second level appear successful when comparing them to the focus group
participants’ opinions. The participants mainly had positive perceptions about the
company, particularly the participants who matched the characteristics of the
company’s target group. Nonetheless, even two individuals that in theory match the
characteristics of this target group, did not have a positive perception of the company.
This was either due to feeling of confusion about the company brand or genuineness.
“[…] My first thought when I saw the first page [of the portfolio] was “grandma”. Like
what, is this their look? When I continued it felt very all over the place, they have no
coherent red line though what they do or try to communicate.”

Most of the participants thought that Swedish Stockings stand out amongst its
competitors, in more ways than one. This is attributed to the company’s clearly
communicated values, the lack of product focus and emphasis on the company’s and
its products’ environmental impact. One focus group participant stated that “it is clear
that they differentiate themselves mainly through their values, while H&M and Lindex
put the profit first. It’s an entirely different approach”. Some of the participants
60

commented on the difference in presented the products and the style used to do so.
One participant thought the visual communication looked aged and stood out
compared to other popular fashion brands because of it. Frisinger highlighted the
importance of design for Swedish Stockings in her interview. The communicated
design aspects were not received by the focus group participants in the way that the
company was hoping for. Multiple participants stated that the tables were a strange
step to be taken by a hosiery company, while others stated they did not believe the
design of the product was as important to the company as promoting the sustainability
of it.
Frisinger emphasized the importance of transparency within all parts of the company,
throughout the entire production process. The transparency is key as it enables
competitors to view their manufacturing process and become informed and inspired
and ultimately allows for market-shaping through a transfer of knowledge. It also
allows consumers to become aware of how the majority of companies produce
different pieces of clothing, and what effect this has on society and our environment.
By informing consumers, Swedish Stockings encourages them to make informed
choices in all areas of consumption, as well as to start questioning companies who are
not doing their part when it comes to societal and ecological sustainability. This will
further support the market-shaping, as consumers choices and demand shape
companies need to adapt and develop. Generation Y, growing up surrounded by
information, react well to transparency and the feeling of genuineness. It was touched
upon by several group participants, mainly when discussing greenwashing and how
Swedish Stockings do not appear to conduct any, despite being very vocal about their
sustainability efforts in their communication. The company’s communicated social
and environmental actions, their production process, and its goals appear transparent
and genuine enough to not be questioned by most of the participants.
In addition to the risk of sustainability communication to be perceived as
greenwashing, it can also be perceived as too provocative, which also has a negative
effect on the consumer, their behaviour and purchase intentions. The campaign “This
is us – this is them” is an example of such a risk. The campaign had not received any
criticism or negativity according to Frisinger, however, was met with varied opinions
by the focus group participants. All five FG1 participants disliked it, some even
claiming it to be proof of the company being “preachy” or having a “superiority
61

complex” and stated that the company does not gain anything by putting down others.
The group felt that the campaign went against the values communicated by the
company and that there was no need to negatively communicate about competitors.
“I have a problem with this. I think it’s very polarising and something I think we
should be moving away from, to put things into groups. Even if they’re
sustainable nobody is ever perfect.”

2/5 FG2 participants were neutral to the campaign, while the remaining three found
the campaign to be positive. Based on these findings, the success of the campaign is
must be questioned. The campaign was met with more negative perceptions than
positive ones regarding the company, despite the message of the campaign being that
competitors are not acting in a sustainable way which will benefit the planet. The
message of the campaign is lost by making it too simplistic and polarising, accusing
the competitors instead of highlighting the positives of the own innovation and
production process. Participants of Generation Y are known for being highly critical
of the information they are fed, and this was supported by the focus group participants’
reactions.

7. Conclusion and discussion
This chapter makes up the conclusion and discussion of the thesis. It further
encompasses managerial implications, limitations and how these could have been
avoided, as well as suggestions for future research to further study and develop the
knowledge of the subject of this thesis.

7.1 Conclusion
This thesis has studied the way of which a company within the clothing industry
communicates its efforts to shape the market to achieve increased sustainability.
Swedish Stockings officially state that they are trying to change and shape the hosiery
market to become more sustainable within production, use of material and way of
recycling. They often highlight how they are the only sustainable hosiery brand
worldwide and have a strong focus on social media for communicating with their target
group as well as competitors. Their communication strategy for social media is based
on simplicity, transparency, genuineness and informing consumers with a twinkle in
their eye. Swedish Stockings want to be seen as an individual that consumers want to
spend time with all the while learning about the products and production process
within the hosiery industry. By learning of the damage caused by most stockings due
to them being made of raw oil, they want to change the consumer behaviours and invite
competitors to take part in Swedish Stockings’ innovations, production, and recycling
program. By encouraging and offering to help competitors, the company hopes to
change the entire industry. The communication on Instagram is nuanced and varies
from other clothing companies. As the company wants to be seen as an interesting
individual and have a community of informed consumers, they do not only speak about
their products but aims to incorporate multiple different aspects to the firm’s
personality and brand. Such things include informing of current environmental crises
and how to help, speaking of how to support healthcare workers during the 2020
pandemic and questioning other companies’ behaviours.
With this thesis, I have studied how consumers within Generation Y perceive and react
to companies’ communication efforts to shape markets to achieve sustainability.
Consumers within Generation Y have a different perception of marketing and
appreciate two-way communication between the consumer and the company. Having
63

conducted two focus group discussions with individuals from Generation Y, it became
evident that the generation has varying opinions and perceptions of companies such as
Swedish Stockings who are trying to communicate their efforts for increased
sustainability. The focus group participants had both negative and positive reactions
to the company’s communication on the social media channel Instagram. Most
individuals formed an interest in the company and its business model or products, and
multiple individuals stated that they could be future customers. The positive feedback
shows how the company communication has been successful. However, not everyone
agreed, and it appeared to mainly be contributed to personal interests, values, or the
campaign “This is us – this is them”, which was perceived by many as unnecessarily
provocative and even preachy.
Prior research studying Generation Y’s perception of sustainability communication
has shown that the generation holds a general interest in sustainability and find it to be
highly important to communicate about. The generation differs from older generations
as it has a deep understanding of social media and the communication done over its
platforms. Generation Y analytical of companies’ efforts to communicate about
sustainability and are often able to understand when a company is greenwashing
instead of carrying out sustainable activities. However, simultaneously, some research
states that the generation is mainly interested in the firm externally stating their efforts
for increased sustainability, without further investigating whether such statements are
true or not. Research has also shown that Generation Y often wants to know that their
purchases are sustainably and ethically produced, although they are not willing to put
any effort into researching the sustainability of products. They want to be presented
with the information without having to put in any work themselves.
The results show some conflicting evidence of what Swedish Stocking want to
communicate about their market-shaping efforts of increasing sustainability. The
campaigns presenting how the company gives back to the community by supporting
healthcare staff and informing of how individuals can help during the Australia bush
fires were met with positivity and interest from the focus group participants. This
mirrors what the company was trying to achieve with these subjects of external
communication and supported an optimistic consumer brand perception. The
campaign “This is us – this is them” did not receive as good feedback as most focus
group participants either felt neutral or repelled by the visuals and message. The
64

negative feelings obtained from the campaign appears to have affected some of the
participants’ overall opinions of the brand and made them uninterested in the company
in addition to their actions and products. The fact that Frisinger stated that the
campaign had not received any backlash could be due to consumers either feeling
neutral about the campaign or unwilling to take up a discussion of the subject. Most of
the participants who disliked the campaign did not feel so because they believed the
campaign to be incorrect, but rather because of the way it portrayed the two types of
companies in such a black and white fashion, when humans and company rarely if ever
show such polarising extremes. The lack of criticism of the campaign may also be
explained by the cultural differences of Swedes and Swedish speaking Finns. It may
be that Swedish speaking Finns are less likely to appreciate a campaign which brags
about themselves while claiming to be better than one’s competitors. However, as
cultural differences were not brought up during the discussions, this explanation can
only be speculated about.
The participants expressed varied opinions and some even changed their minds during
the discussion. This may be because of the group dynamics and how individuals
subconsciously or consciously adapted to the general mindset of the group and the
opinions expressed. Had the groups been formed differently or using other
participants, the effects of the group dynamics may have been either stronger or lesser.
The group interaction is likely to have affected the data collected and thus also the
analysis and results. FG1 consisted of more out-spoken individuals, not afraid to speak
their minds. They might have been impacted by each other’s negative or sceptical
views. FG1 also had two men, while the other group only had one. As men are
normatively less likely to have an interest in stockings this may also be an explanation
as to why two out of three men expressed not having any interest in the company, its
business model or community activism. The effect of having mixed groups of two
genders may have impacted the opinions or expressed opinions of all participants. That
said, having groups of two genders may also have not had any impact whatsoever.

7.2 Discussion
Previous research has shown that Generation Y reacts differently to previous
generations regarding marketing. They value sustainability, genuineness, and
65

transparency within brands and are mostly able to tell when a company is conducting
greenwashing. However, they are simultaneously not willing to put effort into
researching whether a brand is sustainable or not, as they want the information to be
openly communicated and easily accessible. Based on previous research, one would
expect the focus group participants to name sustainability as a factor affecting purchase
decisions, also regarding clothing purchases. However, in this thesis, it quickly became
evident that the focus group participants did not think of the sustainability of a garment
and were not willing to pay a lot more money for an item that has been produced
sustainability. There appeared to be a difference between the participants’ purchase
choices at the time of the discussion and the kind of products they wish they were
investing in. Multiple participants openly stated that they wish they could make better
purchase choices when it comes to clothing but are not willing or capable of doing so
at the time of the discussion. This conflict can be explained by the ages and life
situations of the individuals. All participants were either still studying towards a
university degree or had recently received one and entered the working market. Some
participants stated that once they are in a more stable economic situation, they want to
make improvements in their decisions. It was further accented that some participants
already wanted to choose sustainable alternatives, but that they found it hard to find
enough and legit information regarding brands’ sustainability. They were not willing
to put effort into researching and would therefore end up making uninformed
decisions. This supports the results of previous studies and further emphasizes the need
for sustainable companies to openly communicate their environmentally and socially
responsible actions in a way which grabs consumers attention and facilitates their
purchase decisions.
The results of the study were expected to an extent, as I anticipated some participants
would not show any interest in the product and the brand’s sustainability, knowing
some individuals’ views on sustainability. However, some group participants that I
had expected to not show any interest did like the company and wanted to know more
and vice versa. However, certain parts of the company’s communication strategies
were met with more scepticism than anticipated, e.g., the campaign “This is us – this
is them” or the heavy focus on the company’s view on sustainability, as the entire FG1
disliked the campaign. This discrepancy of anticipated and unanticipated opinions may
be the result of the choice of method and how it was carried out. Opting for focus
66

group discussions rather than conducting one-on-one interviews with the participants
did lead to them influencing each other, which, as previously stated, can be both good
and bad. The discussions may cause the individuals to think further based on the
declarations of others and go deeper into otherwise undiscovered thoughts and
opinions.
I believe that the group dynamic impacted the participants’ opinions, no matter if this
happened subconsciously or if the participants adapted to the other group members’
opinions on purpose to better fit in with the group. However, as all members of FG1
have strong personalities and are generally known for not struggling with expressing
themselves, it can also be assumed that the individuals were not as affected by the
others’ beliefs but rather happened to sometimes think very similarly. The group
dynamic of FG2 must also be considered, as it might have also played a part in its
members expressed opinions. A member in FG2 that I did not expect to show any
interest in the product nor the company or the business plan surprised me by stating
that they would be interested in learning more about the company, their recycling
program and activism. He also expressed an interest in the production and supply
chain. The overall beliefs of FG2 were positive, especially when compared to FG1. It
may be that the aforementioned individual was impacted by the overall mindset of the
group and therefore also showed more interest in the company and their actions.
The results were both in congruence and conflict with the theory presented in the
theoretical framework. The communication conducted through social media is a good
channel for targeting Generation Y as they are very comfortable with the format and
can form quick opinions with short texts and a lot of visual communication. The theory
by Newig et al. (2013) on the complexity of sustainability could be seen in the type of
communication Swedish Stockings conducted, and most of the participants appeared
to receive a perception of the company as a sustainability-focused brand. The
communicated goals which should be of interest to both the company and the
consumers were not successful amongst all focus group participants. This, however,
supports the third dimension by Newig et al. (2013), which states the difficulty in
uniting actors on different levels and work towards the same goals. As two of the focus
group participants did not view Swedish Stockings as a market-shaping company, but
the rest of the group members did, it appears as if the company has succeeded at least
partly with their sustainability and market-shaping communication.
67

What further suggests a successful communication strategy conducted by Swedish
Stockings, is how all but two group members positively perceived the company as a
vocal green firm, which in turn means that they can tell that the company is not
greenwashing. However, as some participants stated, Swedish Stockings are a
company and therefore must sell things to be able to remain on the market and carry
out market-shaping. This brings forward the question of sustainable capitalism, and
whether it is even possible. As companies claim to be sustainable and not
greenwashing, is it valid to take them by their words? Or is sustainability at its core in
a business setting an impossible feature which can never be fully achieved, or even
achieved to a significant enough level to benefit society?
These questions have been heavily discussed especially in the last few years, as the
climate crisis concerns have steadily increased and left people in fear of the future.
Initially when climate change was starting to arise concern, businesses no matter the
size contradicted and downplayed the effects of climate change and attributed its
consequences to natural events. However, in recent years, organisations are no longer
able to deny the current climate crisis and their part in it (Baer, 2012). Researchers
such as Newell and Paterson (2010) state the need for climate capitalism, all the while
acknowledging the difficulty in putting it into practice. The questions regarding
sustainable capitalism should be considered further and could hold a much larger place
in future research.

7.3 Managerial implications
This subchapter discusses how the results can be used as potential managerial
implications. Based on the findings of this thesis there are some things managers
should consider when conducting market-shaping and communicating in the aim of
achieving sustainability within the clothing industry.
When trying to communicate sustainability and market-shaping efforts to Generation
Y, managers should focus on using channels on social media such as e.g., Instagram,
as this is a successful marketing tool and Generation Y spend a lot of time on social
media. The type of communication is, however, also essential. This thesis shows that
managers must carefully consider their communication, both visually and by choosing
the right words and message. Swedish Stockings’ social media strategy is based on
68

transparency and the want to inform consumers about the issues with the hosiery
industry and its products. They focus on simplicity as they judge it to be the core of
communication. This may be successful in some campaigns; however, it may also be
perceived as too aggressive and preachy. Managers must consider this, especially
when communicating and informing about the difference between their own company
and its competitors. Most of the focus group participants stated that the campaign “This
is us – this is them” would have been more believable had it solely focused on the
benefits and positives of Swedish Stockings, rather than showing the supposed
behaviour of their competitors. Although, some individuals also found the campaign
to be provocative but in a positive way which makes the viewer question companies’
production processes and one own’s consumer behaviour. By considering the way this
type of communication may be perceived by different cultures, the negative effects
can be avoided, which will result in more people appreciating such a campaign.
Informing about the environmental and social benefits of a sustainable product
throughout its cycle of production and use were met with overall positivity and appears
advantageous as focus group participants openly expressed a wish for learning more
about the business model and production. This also led to several participants also
showed a genuine interest in becoming

7.4 Limitations
This thesis is subject to multiple limitations which should be considered and improved
upon in case of future research. These limitations are due to restraints such as focus
group participants’ availability and wiliness to participate, time, money, and place. As
I aimed to study the beliefs of Generation Y, I had to ensure that all focus group
participants were within that age group. This impacted the number of people I could
ask to take part in the study. This was further affected by the need for all participants
to speak Swedish to allow them to speak in their mother tongue freely and fully
understand the other participants. The groups further needed to understand English to
be able to understand the portfolio representing Swedish Stockings’ communication
on Instagram. The limited amount of people who could be asked to participate was
further subject to the willingness to participate and availability during the established
time of research. The thesis was written during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore
69

all focus groups were conducted online over Zoom rather than in person, due to social
distancing recommendations. This restriction, however, also facilitated a more diverse
group of individuals living in different cities to participate. The individuals who
participated in the focus group discussions have grown up in multiple different cities
over southern and middle Finland. They have similar cultures and upbringings due to
all being part of the Swedish speaking minority in Finland. If the same study would
have been conducted in Sweden or within a broader group of Finnish speaking Finns,
the answers may have been more varied.
When using focus group discussions as a method for gathering data, it is ultimately
impossible to know how any group dynamics or personality interactions may have
affected the individuals’ statements. Nonetheless, by carefully considering the
participants’ characters before attributing them to one of the groups, and by initiating
the discussions by emphasizing that there is no right or wrong answer and ensuring
that every member got to speak their mind, I hope to have eliminated this probability
as much as possible.
As always when conducting interviews and focus group discussions, the interviewer
must always remain as objective as possible and not influence the interviewee or group
members. However, it is impossible to remain 100% objective during the analysis and
result presentation. As I had already read up on the themes which I had an interest in
studying, I knew what I was looking for when analysing the transcriptions. Though I
constantly attempted to remain open to the meaning of the data, I cannot with certainty
state that my previous studies of the subjects did not impact my thinking and way of
analysing. It may be that another research conducting the same research with very
similar personalities and themes were to reach a very similar analysis of the collected
data. It may also lead to a different analysis due to that individuals’ previous
experiences, whether they be scientific or not.
As it is a thesis, the research had to be carried out within a specific time frame and
could not be made into a long-term study. Consequently, the results cannot say
anything about the future, although assumptions can be made based on the data and
previous studies. In addition to the limited timeframe, the study is always affected by
the researcher’s previous experiences and knowledge. Despite trying to remain
objective throughout the research, data collection, analysis and presentation of results,
70

the researcher’s own opinions may subconsciously have affected the study.

7.5 Future research
As stated within the thesis’ limitations, due to this study being subject to time
restraints, it was impossible to measure long term effects and whether the focus group
participants’ opinions could have transformed over time. This would be expected, as
all individuals progressively change. Future research could, however, measure future
market-shaping efforts and sustainability communication, as well as how it is received
by either Generation Y or Generation Z. Carrying out a similar study with different
individuals of the same Generation Y could strengthen the results of this study, as it
would offer a wider range of personalities and opinions.
Another thing to consider for future research is the possibility of adding the opinions
of competitors or other market actors. This thesis has focused on what Swedish
Stockings was trying to convey through their communication and achieve marketshaping, in addition to the perceptions of this communication by potential consumers
and target group individuals. A future study could combine these findings with the
opinions of other market actors and competitors and see whether the market-shaping
conducted by Swedish Stockings has had an effect on increasing the sustainability by
changing business models or ways of production for other firms.
Future research that would cover the success of market-shaping strategies for increased
sustainability would also be interesting, as well as what happens if a market-shaping
company such as Swedish Stockings have succeeded in transforming the market and
all firms are operating in similar ways and producing equally sustainable products.
Frisinger stated that the scenario would be ideal and that they only want to be
remembered as the original if that were to happen. One focus group participant had an
equally positive view of such a future scenario, however, most of the participants
agreed that such a scenario would mean the end of Swedish Stockings unless they
could retain a loyal consumer base or further focus on their innovation. Only future
research can tell what will happen.

8. Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Marknadsutformning och hållbarhetskommunikation inom klädindustrin
Generation Y:s konsumentuppfattning

Inledning
Allt eftersom kunskapen om den nuvarande klimatkrisen sprider sig, måste företag och
konsumenter överväga sitt eget beteende och förbereda sig för enorma förändringar
inom

en

snar

framtid.

Klädindustrin

är

särskilt

problematisk

från

ett

hållbarhetsperspektiv och producerar 10 % av alla koldioxidutsläpp i hela världen
(McFall-Johnsen, 2019). Företag inom industrin måste tänka om sitt agerande inom
alla områden samt vilka negativa konsekvenser det har, och få konkurrenterna att göra
detsamma. Denna avhandling baserar sig på den moderna insikten om att marknader
inte är stabila strukturer, utan tvärtom. Företag kan omforma dem istället för att behöva
anpassa sig själva till marknaderna och på så sätt skapa miljömässigt positiva
förändringar (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015).

Syfte och forskningsfrågor
Avhandlingen är en fallstudie av företaget Swedish Stockings, ett strumpbyxföretag
som framställer sig själv som en marknadsutformare. Företaget kan räknas som born
global i och med sin internationella inriktning, enbart engelska kommunikation och
globala nätförsäljning. Trots detta är huvudmarknaden fortsättningsvis Sverige och
Skandinavien där företaget är baserat. Syftet med avhandlingen är att ge en djupare
förståelse av hur hållbarhetsansträngningar inom marknadsutformning kommuniceras
av företag, samt hur konsumenter uppfattar och reagerar på denna kommunikation.
Detta är viktigt för att företag ska veta att deras kommunikation tas emot på rätt sätt
av konsumenterna och får goda konsekvenser. Med utgångspunkt i syftet har jag
identifierat tre forskningsfrågor som jag ämnar besvara genom denna avhandling:
•

Hur kommunicerar företag sina försök att forma marknaden för att uppnå
hållbarhet?

•

Hur uppfattar och reagerar konsumenter inom generation Y på företags försök
att utforma marknaden på detta sätt?

72

•

Hur beskrivs generation Y:s uppfattning om hållbarhetskommunikation inom
forskning?

Metod och datainsamling
Eftersom avhandlingen undersöker konsumenters uppfattningar om Swedish
Stockings hållbarhetskommunikation används en multikvalitativ forskningsmetod.
Datainsamlingen gjordes i form av en företagsintervju med VD Linn Frisinger och två
fokusgruppdiskussioner med fem deltagare per grupp. Totalt deltog 3 män och 7
kvinnor och deltagarna valdes ut baserat på vem som var tillgänglig, villig att delta
och passade in på kriterierna, dvs. tillhörde generation Y, hade svenska som
modersmål och kunskaper i engelska, samt var finländare. Jag kände alla deltagare mer
eller mindre, och kunde därför besluta vem som skulle vara i vilken grupp. På så sätt
kunde jag minska antalet eventuellt påverkande faktorer som personlighet och
relationer. Fokusgrupperna fick en portfolio med bilder från Swedish Stockings
instagram publicerade mellan december 2019 och maj 2020. Bilderna valdes i ett
försök att ge en så representativ och mångfacetterad bild av företagets kommunikation
som möjligt.
Jag gjorde pilotintervjuer innan de riktiga intervjuerna som bidrog till att försäkra att
frågorna var rätt formulerade och undvek missförstånd. Datainsamlingen för
fokusgrupperna gjordes på Zoom och företagsintervjun på telefon. Jag spelade in båda
och använde ljudfilerna för att transkribera alla diskussioner. Jag gjorde en öppen
abduktiv kodning på insamlade data och färgkodade och kategoriserade dem för att
kunna jämföra resultaten.

Redogörelse för undersökningen
Jag jämförde först data från de två fokusgrupperna (FG1 och FG2). Båda grupperna
ansåg att hållbarhet är en viktig och påverkande faktor vid inköp av t.ex. livsmedel
eller inredning, men ej vid klädinköp. FG2:s deltagare hade överlag en positivare
inställning till kommunikationen i portfolion och till företaget som en helhet.
Majoriteten av FG1 tyckte att en av kampanjerna som använts var särskilt
provocerande och fick därefter en mycket negativ inställning till företaget, vilket drog
ner på deras köpbeslutsvilja. Flera av deltagarna såg kampanjen som ett bevis på att
73

Swedish Stockings anser sig stå över andra företag. Kampanjen fick både positivt och
neutralt bemötande av FG2, som överlag hade en positivare inställning till företaget
och dess kommunikation. Alla i FG2 var intresserade av att få veta mer om företaget
flera av deltagarna nämnde att de kunde tänka sig köpa deras produkter. Majoriteten
ansåg att företaget var transparent och att fokuset inte enbart låg på produkterna, på
gott och ont.
Swedish Stockings menar att de är det enda hållbara strumpbyxföretaget och att deras
vision från början har varit att förändra hela deras marknad. Hållbarhet och innovation
är essentiella delar av företagets företagsmodell, och kommunikationen är ett verktyg
för att förmedla företagets vision utåt. Kommunikationen baserar sig främst på
transparens och att visa att företaget gör mer än bara skapar strumpbyxprodukter
genom att exempelvis engagera sig i samhällsproblem och infomera sina följare om
detta.
Fokusgruppernas svar överensstämde till viss del med vad Frisinger beskriver att
Swedish Stockings vill åstadkomma genom sin kommunikation, men belyste även en
rad skillnader. Kampanjen som mottogs väldigt olika inom de olika grupperna
beskrevs av Frisinger som mycket lyckad och fick inga negativa reaktioner. Som
nämndes reagerade alla inom FG1 negativt på kampanjen och flera uppgav att det gav
en negativ uppfattning om företaget som helhet då de ansåg att det är onödigt att tala
illa om andra företag. Detta kan bestridas med Frisinger, som menade att de enbart är
transparenta och visar sanningen.

Resultat
Resultaten tyder på att företag måste ha en god känndeom om hela marknaden för att
influera konkurrenter och positivt påverka konsumenterna att ändra sina vanor.
Swedish Stockings metod för marknadsutformning går i enlighet med de aktiviteter
som rekommenderas av Kindström et al. (2018) för en lyckad sådan. Dessa aktiviteter
består av att förändra normer, ingjuta kunskap, öka rätt sorts efterfrågan, förstå värde
och kunder, bygga upp trovärdighet, återskapa processer, bygga applikationskunskap
och utveckla teknologi.
Det är förvånande att deltagarna inte anser att hållbarhet är en viktig inköpsfaktor vid
klädinköp, utan främst vid inhandling av livsmedel, då klädindustrin ansvarar för det
74

största koldioxidutsläppet (McFall-Johnsen, 2019). Det är trots detta positivt att
kommunicera om sin hållbarhet, något som borde göras på ett transparent och genuint
sätt som inte leder till att konsumenter uppfattar det som gröntvätt (Delmas & Curuel
Burbano, 2011).
Swedish Stockings inser problemet med avsaknaden av generationens förståelse för
hållbarhet och klädindustrin, och försöker informera och inspirera konsumenterna
genom sin kommunikation. De tar upp exempel på hur hållbara företag beter sig, vad
man ska ifrågasätta och varför det är viktigt göra detta. De samarbetar med
konkurrenter för att skapa ett starkt nätverk, vilket krävs, åtminstone temporärt, för att
kunna utföra marknadsutformning (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2015).
Fokusgruppsdeltagarna uppfattade företagets värden som tydliga, och förstod även
deras vilja att informera om de egna aktiviteterna utöver enbart produkterna. Detta
innebär att Swedish Stockings varumärke tydligt framkommer på det sätt som
företaget avsett (Ertimur & Coskuner-Balli, 2015). Eftersom varumärkesuppfattningen
starkt baseras på vad andra konsumenter tycker, så kan gruppdynamiken inom
fokusgrupperna ha påverkat den allmänna känslan inom gruppen för företaget.
Swedish Stockings infomerar inte bara om sina produkter, utan tar även upp aktuella
ämen som är viktiga för samhället, som Australiens bränder eller vårdpersonalens
insatser under coronapandemin. Företaget belyser även hur man som konsument kan
veta om ett företag är genuint hållbart eller bidrar till negativa effekter på miljön eller
på

individers

välmående.

Swedish

Stockings

uppmärksammar

även

hela

produktionsprocessen, från början till slut, i ett försök att vara transparenta och hjälpa
konkurrenter byta till ett mer hållbart system. Genom att ta upp dessa ämnen bidrar
företaget med mervärde till både konsumenter och konkurrenter, samtidigt som
företaget själv gynnas om dessa grupper tar åt sig av informationen och väljer Swedish
Stockings produkter eller produktionssätt framför andra strumpbyxmärken.

Diskussion och avslutning
Vad som händer om Swedish Stockings lyckas med sin marknadsutformning och att
skapa en hållbar marknad är en relevant fråga och detta diskuterades både inom
foksugrupperna och i företagsintervjun. De flesta deltagarna såg det som ett problem
för företaget, men Frisinger sa att detta är målet. Om det händer kommer Swedish
75

Stockings frångå sin grundidé och fokusera på sitt återvinningsprogram som skapar
nya produkter av gamla strumpbyxor istället.
Inom framtida forskning kan man undersöka andra marknader och se hur
uppfattningarna skiljer sig mellan generation Y och generation Z. Det skulle även vara
viktigt att ta med icke-binära individer för att ge en mer varierad översikt över olika
individers tankar. Eftersom denna avhandling bygger på en kvalitativ forskningsmetod
kan resultaten inte generaliseras på samma sätt som kvantitativ forskning. Resultaten
kan dock ge en överblick över hur individer inom generation Y reagerar på
hållbarhetskommunikation och hur företag kan använda sig av detta för att förbättra
marknadens hållbarhet genom marknadsutformning.

Appendix A - Focus group discussion manuscript
Introduktion (5 min)
Tusen tack till alla er att ni tagit er tid att delta. Jag ser fram emot att diskutera er syn
på hållbarhet, marknadsutformning och kommunikation inom klädindustrin idag. Jag
vill börja med att be er alla lägga era mobiler på ljudlöst och lägga dem bort från
datorn för att inte störa nätet.
Dagens diskussion kommer ta ungefär 1-1,5 timme och ljudet kommer spelas in.
Materialet kommer enbart användas för min forskning här vid ÅA/Handelshögskolan
och ni kommer alla förbli anonyma. Datainsamlingen är en del av min gradu inom
marknadsutformning och hållbarhet. Är alla okej med att jag spelar in? Sen för att jag
ska kunna höra alla efteråt när jag lyssnar på bandet så ber jag er försöka prata bara
en person i taget.
Jag har sammanställt en portfolio som jag skickat till er innan det här mötet, och jag
hoppas alla hunnit kasta ett öga på den. Portfolion representerar strumpföretaget
Swedish Stockings, och det spelar ingen roll om ni hört om detta företag före idag
eller inte. Dagens diskussion kräver ingen förhandskunskap förutom portfolion. Jag
är intresserad av det här företaget och deras beteende utåt på marknaden, och vill ni
höra era tankar kring detta.
Allas åsikter och tankar är lika viktiga och av lika intresse, så tveka inte att uttrycka
vad ni tycker, även om ni inte är 100% säkra på att det är relevant eller att det hör hit.
Det finns inga rätta eller felaktiga svar. Mitt mål är att föra en avslappnad och aktiv
diskussion idag.
Några frågor så här långt?
Presentationer (5 min)
Till att börja med skulle jag vilja att ni presenterar er själva en åt gången. Vänligen
säg ditt namn, ålder, studieämne eller arbete, samt om du någonsin träffat på Swedish
Stockings i sociala medier eller hört talas om dem någon annanstans förut före idag.
• Försäkra att alla har kommit ihåg att presentera sig själva ordentligt och svarat på
alla frågor.
85

Tema A: Miljömässig hållbarhet – viktigt vid inköpsbeslut eller inte? (20 min)
Vi kommer börja med att diskutera hållbarhet som en påverkande faktor vid
köpbeslut.
1. Vilka aspekter påverkar dina beslut när du ska införskaffa en ny produkt tex ett
klädesplagg?
2. Hur mycket påverkar produktens hållbarhet ditt beslut (mat, möbler)?
- Gäller detta enbart vissa produkter eller alla?
3. Är du villig att betala mer för en hållbar produkt?
- Hur mycket mer? Varför/varför inte? Vilken slags produkt?

Tema B: Konsumentuppfattning (25 min)
Vi kommer nu att gå in mer specifikt på strumpföretaget Swedish Stockings.
• Be alla ta upp portfolion som skickats ut tidigare under dagen och som de redan
tittat igenom. Diskutera följande frågor:
1. Vad är ditt allmänna intryck av Swedish Stockings?
- Positivt eller negativt? – Varför?
2. Vem riktar sig deras produkter till?
- Den vanliga konsumenten/miljömedvetna/alla kvinnor?
3. Står de ut från andra företag inom samma bransch? Ex. Lindex, H&M, Woolford,
Ikea?
4. Intresserar de dig? Skulle du vilja veta mera om dem? Om koncept eller
tillverkningsprocessen?
5. Vad vill de åstadkomma med sin kommunikation?
- Vad uttrycker de?
6. Vilka känslor väcker deras kommunikation med omvärlden hos dig?
- Ex. This is us – this is them, eller Utbilda
86

Tema C: Marknadsutformning (market-shaping) – reaktiv eller proaktiv (20
min)
Dagens sista tema är marknadsutformning eller så kallad market-shaping. Det
innebär att man påverkar och försöker förändra marknaden och fungerar som en
slags ledare inom en viss industri eller bransch.
1. Är Swedish stockings marknadsutformare?
- Försöker de förändra marknaden? Ja/Nej – På vilket sätt?
- Försöker de få konkurrenter att göra lite mer som de själva? Försöker
de förändra strumpindustrin?
- Tror du att de själva anser att de lyckas?
2. Kan Swedish Stockings faktiskt få andra företag att ändra sig och bli mer/helt
hållbara?
3. Kan ett företag ta på sig rollen som en miljöaktivist? Är det vad Swedish
Stockings gör?
- Vad innebär det att vara en aktivist?
4. Hur kommer framtiden inom marknaden se ut om andra företag efterapar
produkten?
- Vad händer om alla gör samma sak?
- Hur utmärker sig företagen och håller sig konkurrenskraftiga om alla
gör detsamma?

Avslutning
Fler tankar – idéer?
Det var min sista fråga, jag vill än en gång tacka er alla för att ni deltagit. Kommer
hjälpa mig massor i min avhandling. Ha en fortsatt härlig kväll!

Appendix B - Swedish Stockings company interview with CEO Linn
Frisinger
Introduktion (svara gärna kort)
•

Kan du börja med att berätta om hur du själv ser på Swedish Stockings?
- På vilken marknad verkar ni?
- Kan du beskriva era viktigaste målgrupper?
- Vem anser ni är era huvudkonkurrenter?

Hållbarhet
•

Vad innebär hållbarhet för företaget?

•

Vilka faktorer är viktigast för er framtida utveckling?

Kommunikation
•

Berätta om principerna för er kommunikation med omvärlden - Har ni en
kommunikationsstrategi?
- Hur ser kommunikationsstrategierna ut för sociala medier?
Det verkar som om det skapats ett community mellan Swedish Stockings och
era följare på instagram.
- Håller du med om detta?
- Är det något ni kontinuerligt utvecklar och funderar på?
- Vilka slags personer består communityt av?
- Hur tror ni era communitymedlemmars uppfattningar om er skiljer sig från
deras uppfattningar om konkurrenterna?

•

Ni postar inte enbart inlägg om era specifika produkter utan ni tar också upp
företagsvärderingar/informerar om exempelvis Rachel Carson (the mother of
the environmental movement), Australiens bushfires, tar upp hur ni skiljer er
från konkurrenterna.
- Vad vill ni kommunicera med dessa inlägg (det blir nästan lite
miljöaktivistiskt)/ vad vill ni att de ska leda till?
- Hur har dessa inlägg bemötts? Ex. This is us, this is them

88

Marknadsutformning/marknadsutveckling
Med marknadsutformning syftar jag alltså på hur en eller flera aktörer på en marknad
kan förändra en marknad genom sitt beteende och sin kommunikation med
omvärlden. Tex hur Apple gjorde om telefonbranschen när de introducerade Iphone.
•

Hur vill ni påverka resten av marknaden ni är aktiva inom?

•

Har ni sett en förändring bland konkurrenternas utbud eller konsumentbeteendet
under åren?
- Konsumtentbeteendet, har det ändrats?

•

Hur ser framtiden ut inom er marknad?
- Åt vilket håll eller hur vill ni se att marknaden utvecklas? Tror du att företag
kommer bli mer eller mindre hållbara?

•

Vad händer om konkurrenterna utvecklar liknande produkter för jämförbara
priser – hur håller ni konkurrenskraften? Det kanske är just innovationen som du
nämnde tidigare?
- Hur ofta har ni nya innovationer?

Avslutande frågor
•

Är det något vi inte talat om ännu som är viktigt för mig att förstå angående
företagets kommunikationsstrategi eller marknadsutformning?

•

Kan ett företag vara helt hållbart?

89

Appendix C - Portfolio used during focus group discussions

Produkter
Swedish Stockings är enligt dem själva: “the only sustainable hosiery brand worldwide”. De
producerar strumpbyxor, sockor, leggings, cykelshorts och bord. Alla produkter hittas på
deras hemsida, de har inga fysiska butiker utan samarbetar med återförsäljare.

90

Produktionsprocessen
Vanliga strumpbyxor är gjorda av ren olja. Swedish Stockings undviker detta genom att
skapa deras produkter av tex. återvunnet material, gamla plastflaskor och kaffesump.

Återvinningsprocessen av gamla strumpbyxor
Konsumenter kan nu skicka in gamla, trasiga strumpbyxor oavsett märke till Swedish
Stockings återvinning istället för att de hamnar på soptippen. De återvunna strumpbyxorna
blandas med återvunnet glasfiber och blir till rör som annars skulle vara gjorda av plast, eller
så blir de till bord.

91

Utbilda
Swedish Stockings vill utbilda sina följare och påverka dem då de gör konsumentval.
