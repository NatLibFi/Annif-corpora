Title: The Process of Rebranding a Hospitality Industry SME in a Local Setting: Case
Restaurant Cindy
Subject: International Marketing
Author: Kalle Joukanen

Supervisor: Maria Ivanova-Gongne

Abstract:
Companies of all sorts go through some level of rebranding at some point during their lifetime.
Restaurant ship Cindy in Turku was no exception, as the company intended to initiate a
rebranding process of their own in the spring of 2017. This thesis is a case study of Cindy’s
rebranding process. The aim of the thesis is to create an understanding of the rebranding process
of a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) in the hospitality industry and how the local
setting affects the entirety. Furthermore, the author aims to create a model of the rebranding
process that is applicable to other SMEs in the industry. Key concepts that are discussed include
corporate branding and rebranding.
An empiric research was conducted over the span of approximately five months that included
qualitative interviews of key individuals and participant observation by the author. In addition to
examining the case company, the CEO of another restaurant was interviewed. Narrative analysis
was used as a method of analyzing the gathered data.
The successful rebranding processes of each company were found to follow the theoretical fivestep model created by the author. According to the results, the rebranding process of an SME in
the hospitality industry should adhere to the following steps: identification of old brand
characteristics, analysis of environment and planning, execution of changes, presentation of new
brand, and final evaluation. Management is urged to prioritize the internal aspects of the
process, especially creating a coherent perception of the desired new brand within the
organization. A fundamental awareness of the brand’s internal and external environments as
well as establishing distinct roles for the individuals participating in the process were found to
have a positive impact on the outcome.

1 INTRODUCTION
This introductory chapter will present the topic of the thesis to the reader. After
providing some insight to the background of the thesis, the research questions will be
posed. Finally, the limitations of the study and the structure of the thesis are presented.

1.1 Background of the Thesis
Restaurant ship Cindy in the Aura River in Turku, the case company of this thesis, had
decided to make the switch from being a traditional fine dining restaurant to having a
more easy-going, bistro-like theme. The decision was sparked by the notion that the
traditional style was not working and that the current brand felt outdated. In order to
achieve the desired new theme, restaurant ship Cindy was in for a rebranding process in
the beginning of the year 2017. As the restaurant would not open for business until late
spring, the early months of the calendar year during which Cindy was closed proved to
be an opportune time to make the required changes.
This served as an interesting premise to conduct a study on the rebranding process of a
local hospitality industry company. According to Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 805806), nearly all companies go through some level of rebranding at some point in time,
which makes it a relevant topic for many. Additionally, the extraordinary waterfront
location in which the restaurant resides provides a fascinating setting for the empiric
research. The riverbank of the Aura River is riddled with hospitality service providers
of similar organizational size that could potentially benefit from the results – not to
mention a variety of other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in equivalent
urban waterfront settings elsewhere.

1.2 Aim and Research Questions

5

Kalle Joukanen
This thesis is a study of the rebranding process of restaurant Cindy, the chosen case
company. The purpose of this thesis, which combines an empiric study with a
theoretical literary overview on the topics of corporate branding and rebranding, is to
draw relevant conclusions on the rebranding process of hospitality industry companies.
Furthermore, the author aims to create a rebranding model that is applicable to all SMEs
in the industry.
The research questions that the author aims to answer are the following:
a) What theories and concepts are required to reach an understanding of a
rebranding process?
b) What actions and tools are required in order to achieve successful rebranding of
a hospitality industry SME?
c) How does the local setting affect the brand image and the rebranding process of
SMEs in the hospitality industry?
d) How can SMEs in the hospitality industry achieve a change in brand image
through the rebranding process?
The literary overview seeks to answer the first question, while the others are discussed
later in the thesis.

1.3 Limitations
This study is limited by the organizational size of the case company and the industry in
which it operates. The results are applicable to restaurants, bars, cafés, and hotels alike
that are classified as SMEs according to staff size and structure. Larger organizations
necessitate a more extensive and intricate approach. While most of the theoretical
concepts presented are applicable to a variety of industries, the author has sought to tie
them specifically to the hospitality industry e.g. through the use of practical examples.
The empiric research of the thesis was conducted over the span of several months and
consisted of participant observation as well as in-depth interviews. In addition to
studying the case company, the CEO of another local restaurant was interviewed. The

6

Kalle Joukanen
research is limited to these two companies only in order to maintain a manageable
amount of data.

1.4 Structure of the Thesis
The thesis begins by presenting an apprehensive theoretical framework in the second
and third chapters. An understanding of corporate branding is established before
segueing into the main topic of interest, rebranding. At the end of the second chapter, a
new rebranding model compiled by the author is presented. This model, which is based
on previous studies on the topic, is later used as reference when analyzing the results
from the empiric research.
After a thorough explanation of chosen research methods in chapter three, the findings
from the empiric research are presented. These findings are written in chronological
order and act as the foundation for the analytical discussion that follows. Based on the
discussion, conclusions are consequently made and research questions answered.
Finally, before the list of sources and appendices, there is a Swedish summary of the
entire thesis.

2 CORPORATE BRANDING
Creating and managing a corporate brand goes far beyond the external activities of an
organization that initially come to mind. Successful corporate branding starts inside the
organization and carries out to external stakeholders. The aim of this chapter is to
explain the components of corporate brand identity, to examine how a corporate brand
is created inside an organization, and to discuss the role of an organization’s employees.
More external concepts, like brand awareness and brand image, will be reflected upon
after that in order to create a comprehensive understanding of corporate branding.
Finally, the characteristics of the location unique to the case company of the thesis will
be examined, so as to maintain focus on the case at hand.

2.1 Brand Identity
Consumers seldom form relationships with a product or a service. Instead, they form
relationships with brands. They connect promises, trust, and expectations with brands
and are not alone in doing so. Successful brands position themselves in consumers’
minds on a universal level (Davis 2000, p. 4). A strong brand identity can be listed as
one of the prerequisites for success, which is why the aim of this chapter is to explain
the concept and what it consists of.
A brand identity is a competitive advantage. It is the source of promises and value
associated with a product or service and can lead to noticeable preference even in the
most competitive of spaces. A successfully built brand identity differentiates a brand
from its competition, communicates a brand’s intentions to consumers, and reflects
consumers’ thoughts and values. Furthermore, a strong brand identity creates trust and
loyalty among consumers, which can lead to, among other beneficial things, a company
being able to ask premium prices for their products/services. (Ghodeswar 2008, p. 5.)
According to Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 442), brand identity consists of six
components, which work together and strengthen one another. They are vision, culture,
positioning, personality, relationships, and presentation. The following paragraphs seek
8

Kalle Joukanen
to explain each component and tie them to relevant examples connected to the theme of
this thesis.
The first two components, vision and culture, are closely tied to one another. Brand
vision, in all simplicity, refers to the core purpose of the brand, the basic idea from
which all else is derived (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 443). The vision of a
restaurant brand could be to provide customers with an exclusive wine tasting
experience – an ambitious goal, a reason for being, something that drives the
organization forward. Brand vision is to be communicated clearly inside the
organization in order for it to be completely understood and embraced. It is of outmost
importance that employees have a consistent and profound understanding of the vision
of the brand, so that they can act in a way that makes achieving it possible (Harris & de
Chernatony 2001, p. 443).
An organization’s culture is created by its employees and the personal values and
perceptions of those employees. Together they create an internal culture that reflects to
external stakeholders. Harris and de Chernatony (2001, pp. 443) mean, that in order to
avoid irregularities and negative outcomes, the values of the organization and the vision
of the brand need to be in sync with the internal culture. Desired, consistent behavior is
hence achieved by ensuring that employees understand and share organizational values.
The third component, brand positioning, should, according to Harris and de Chernatony
(2001, p. 444), be connected to its core values and vision. By positioning itself
correctly, and thus targeting the right stakeholders, a brand works towards an identity.
Using the same example as before, the restaurant that wants to provide customers with
exclusive wines needs to position itself so as to attract customers who appreciate fine
wine and to do so in a different manner than its competitors. That being said, brand
positioning happens inside the minds of consumers. Ghodeswar (2008, p. 6) states that
by connecting intangible benefits, like beliefs, values, and feelings, to products or
services, a brand positions itself strategically and contributes to an identity. It is the
emotional significance of a brand that helps it position itself and create relationships
with consumers.

9

Kalle Joukanen
Brand personality is the fourth component of brand identity. The term itself, personality
(of a brand), is used to describe the emotional traits connected to a brand. It is initially
derived from the core values of the brand, but evolves through employee-stakeholder
interaction, endorsement, and user imagery (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 444).
User imagery is a concept that refers to consumers’ own visual images of who the
typical user (customer) of a brand is. Keller (1993 p. 4) concurs in stating that user
imagery is one of the attributes that affect the personality of a brand. He further
elaborates that associations, expressed in the form of adjectives like youthful or
innovative, are often used to help define personality. Brand associations, however, will
be further explained in the following chapters.
The fifth component is relationships. As an organization conducts business,
relationships are formed between the brand and stakeholders of different kinds.
Employees, yet again, play a decisive role in defining the nature of these relationships,
especially ones with consumers. Their behavior and the type of service they provide
strongly affect whether the relationships become positive or negative. Furthermore,
these kinds of employee-consumer relationships are very volatile and thus susceptible to
irregularities. Therefore, in addition to making sure employee behavior is aligned with
the brand’s vision and personality it needs to be consistent. What must be noted,
however, is that employees do not have complete control, since the consumer can distort
relationships as well. Employees simply need to manage what they can. (Harris & de
Chernatony 2001, p. 444.)
Presentation is the sixth component of brand identity. Harris and de Chernatony (2001
p. 444-445) explain that presenting the brand should seek to match the values and selfimage of the consumer. A means of doing so is the usage of brand-related symbolism,
which is created through marketing efforts and employee interaction with consumers. It
is imperative to ensure that the symbolic meanings presented in an organization’s
marketing and through the behavior of its employees are consistent with those of the
brand (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 444-445).
A common factor between the components of brand identity is that marketing efforts
and employee behavior need to match each of them with the core values and desires of
the brand. Internal two-way communication, done on a regular basis, is hence
10

Kalle Joukanen
encouraged in order to turn theory into practice. All of the theory above is applicable to
the hospitality industry, whether the organization is a restaurant, hotel, catering
company, etc. Small and medium-sized hospitality organizations in particular are in a
favorable position where they can effortlessly and regularly communicate with their
staff, due to the manageable size of it. Meeting with a small staff requires less effort
than coordinating either one extensive seminar or several smaller meetings with divided
parts of a large staff.

2.1.1 Family-based Brand Identity
Due to the case company of this thesis being a family business, examining some of the
characteristics specific only to family businesses is justified. Although being a family
business has not been extensively promoted in the case company’s external marketing,
it has always been made clear among employees and it has shaped the internal culture of
the company since its very inception. It is also considered public knowledge in the local
community, partly due to articles in local media outlets (Mikkola 2018).
Family businesses are often closely tied to the family name and are strongly influenced
by the family. As the business grows and time passes, the connection becomes stronger.
A family-based brand identity is a valuable resource that is nearly impossible to imitate
or substitute and one, which, if properly leveraged, can prove to be an advantage on the
market. This is particularly relevant for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
(Craig et al 2007, p. 8).
Craig et al (2007, p. 8-9) point out, that promoting a family-based brand identity can be
a boon to family businesses. Combining family values and interests into the operations
of the company and communicating them to external stakeholders have been proven to
be parts of an effective strategy.
The following subchapter aims to further discuss staff characteristics and other tools for
building a corporate brand from within. An emphasis will be placed upon values and the
importance of communication.

2.2 Building a Brand Internally
As has been previously noted, building a corporate brand begins inside the organization.
Thus, the composition of an organization’s staff and the unhindered exchange of
information within are of great importance. The purpose of this chapter is to present the
ingredients needed to assemble and manage a functional staff and how to utilize it in
building a corporate brand.

2.2.1 Members of Staff
Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 447) mean that a heterogeneous staff could have a
derogatory effect on the performance of a brand. Heterogeneity – i.e. staff members
being different in regards of demographic traits such as age, education, tenure, and
background – means different personal values and opinions, which lead to difficulty in
communication and co-operation. Such difficulties, in turn, add to the unwanted
outcome of the staff being incongruent and having differing perceptions of the corporate
brand (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 447). Inconsistency between the corporate
brand and the brand that staff members purvey to customers can have a negative impact
on the overall credibility of the organization (Foster et al. 2010, p. 408-409).
A congruent brand perception within the staff of an organization is in other words the
ultimate goal. Assembling a homogeneous staff from the very beginning, however,
might not be the optimal way of achieving said goal. A group of people with similar
characteristics and values might agree on too many things and deliver less innovative
solutions. The advantage of a heterogeneous group is the fact that group members are
equipped with a varying range of competence and knowledge, they solve problems
more efficiently, and react well to changing circumstances. The difficulties mentioned
in the previous segment diminish as long as two conditions are met. The staff needs to
spend time together and management needs to take constructive action to lead the staff.
By interacting regularly and having management fight the arising of potential

12

Kalle Joukanen
misconceptions, a heterogeneous staff is able to reach a congruent perception of the
brand. (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 447-448.)

2.2.2 Staff Characteristics
In order to build a corporate brand and ensure positive performance, management and
employees must share values. Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 448-449) argue, that
having similar values leads to people having similar perceptions of things, such as the
corporate brand. They add that shared corporate values guide employees to the kind of
behavior that is sought after and helps communicate the brand externally.
However, not all values within an organization are integral to its success as such. It has
been determined that an organization should keep a few of their most central values
intact, while making others adaptive to change (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 449).
An organization should not be stagnant and unresponsive, nor should it change its ways
every time the wind turns. A middle ground would prove to be the most fruitful option.
Employees are guided not only by the values of the organization, but also by their own
personal values. It is therefore in the organization’s interest, in order to enable optimal
brand performance, to align personal values with those of the organization (Harris & de
Chernatony 2001, p. 449). Complete coherence is hardly necessary, but the core values
of the organization need to be understood and embraced by employees. When such
values are made distinctive enough and easy to understand, it is possible for employees
to identify with the organization, which has been proven to increase positive emotional
attachment to the organization (Foster et al. 2010, p. 402). Proper communication is one
of the main ways of achieving this goal, and that is why the next subchapter is dedicated
to the area.

2.2.3 Internal Communication

13

Kalle Joukanen
In order to achieve a congruent perception of a brand inside an organization, individuals
need to communicate. Without communication, individual opinions and thoughts will
never surface, which leads to them never being resolved and synchronized. (Harris & de
Chernatony 2001, p. 450.)
Internal communication, also referred to as intra-organizational communication or
employee communication, is the term used to describe all communication that happens
within an organization. Internal communication is perceived to go hand-in-hand with
organizational activities such as change management, public relations, and human
resources. The purpose of the act is to create value to the organization, which can be
achieved in a variety of ways. By communicating within the borders of the organization,
the personal goals of the employees and the goals of the organization can be
synchronized. Thus, an internal culture is fortified and value in the form of increased
efficiency is added. (Vercic et al. 2012, p. 225.)
There are varying opinions found in literature on the definition of internal
communication, some of which Welch and Jackson (2007, p. 181-183) examine in their
article on the topic. They range from more simple approaches that define internal
communication as “all methods used by a firm to communicate with its employees” to
more intricate ones like “the professional management of interactions between all those
with an interest or ‘a stake’ in a particular organization” (Welch & Jackson 2007, p.
182). Aspects such as the daily activities of an organization, project management and
strategic benefits are emphasized in the different versions. However, the authors feel
that each definition is lacking in one way or another and that a comprehensive, yet
comprised, version is called for. Thus, Welch and Jackson (2007, p. 183) articulate the
following definition for internal communication:
“…the strategic management of interactions and relationships between
stakeholders at all levels within organizations.”
To elaborate on what was discussed about staff members and their characteristics,
Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 450) feel that homogeneous groups communicate
well together. The odds of misunderstandings and conflicts are minimal and discussions
are fluent. A staff consisting of heterogeneous individuals often face greater challenges
14

Kalle Joukanen
in communicating, but can provide better and more intricate outcomes as a result of
differing opinions and backgrounds. In order to harness the potential of a heterogeneous
staff, they need to communicate often and a lot (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 450451).
In addition to communication being frequent, it needs to be had across the levels of an
organization in a two-way manner. Levels, in this case, refer to the hierarchy within an
organization. Employees, supervisors, and management alike, should in other words
speak with one another regularly. Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 451-452) stress,
however, that management should be the initiating actor in internal brand-related
discussions. Having management discuss the brand’s identity and market
communication, for example through explaining the organization’s advertising and how
its external communication intends to reflect said identity, the chance of employees
misunderstanding things is remarkably decreased.
As an example, the management of a steakhouse should explain the desired effect of its
newly launched TV commercial to its employees. By clearly communicating the
identity that the commercial intends to solidify and stating what kind of target segment
it aims to reach, employees are given the prerequisites to embrace that identity and
further strengthen it as they interact with customers.
The following subchapter aims to elaborate on employees and the role they play in the
organization’s branding process. It will also function as a transition from the more
internal aspects of corporate branding to the external ones.

2.2.4 Role of the Employees
At the heart of an organization’s daily activities lie the employees. They are the
individuals that enable the conducting of a business and most often the ones who
interact with a variety of stakeholders. Employees are, in other words, the middlemen of
an organization’s external and internal environments and thus play a central part in
affecting stakeholder perceptions and gathering critical information. Realizing this,

15

Kalle Joukanen
management is not to consider employees as mere cogs in the organizational machine,
but rather identify them as representatives of the brand (Harris & de Chernatony 2001,
p. 441). Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 819) concur in stating that since stakeholder
perceptions are formed by informal signals, employees prove a crucial part of
determining stakeholder’s feelings towards the brand. The hospitality industry is no
exception to these philosophies as the staff of a restaurant, for example, interacts with
customers on a daily basis and acts as the face of the brand. The performance of the
kitchen staff and the customer interaction of servers and bar personnel directly affect
perceptions of stakeholders and lay the foundation for stakeholder evaluation.
In today’s society, where technology is available for everyone, differentiating a brand
from others using the functional traits of a product or service is increasingly
challenging. Therefore, brand differentiation should focus on emotional aspects that are
communicated not only through advertising, but also through the behavior of
employees. In order to achieve a desired outcome, where the brand’s identity is
correctly purveyed and communicated, the employees’ values need to be consistent with
those of the brand. For this to be possible, employees need to take part in internal
discussion in an active manner. Management is responsible for initiating the discussion
and iterating the desired brand identity. Employees should, in turn, contribute to the
discussion, and make sure the sought-after brand identity is understood and made
possible to channel to external stakeholders. Ultimately, the aim is to narrow the gap
between the brand’s identity and its reputation – something which is elaborated upon
later. (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 442.)
The following chapter will provide an in-depth examination of brand knowledge and
what it consists of. By understanding the composition of brand knowledge, an
organization is able to shape its own brand and communicate it externally to create a
competitive advantage even in the more competitive environments.

2.3 Brand Knowledge

16

Kalle Joukanen
Brand knowledge, as described by Keller (1993, p. 2), is a concept that seeks to explain
what consumers know about a brand and how said knowledge is formed. Brand
knowledge consists of two main categories, which are brand awareness and brand
image, as seen in Figure 1. The following chapters aim to define the two, along with
their respective sub-categories.

Figure 1: Dimensions of Brand Knowledge (Keller 1993, p. 7)
According to Esch et al. (2006, p. 101), consumers’ knowledge of a brand affects their
relationship with the brand and leads to behavioral outcomes, such as future purchase
decisions. SMEs of different kinds should consider this valuable information, as
positive customer relationships are a priority.
Existing knowledge of a brand and the construction of it is information of great interest
in a rebranding process. In order to alter a brand and implement the changes, an
organization must identify the factors that have shaped the brand up until the time of

17

Kalle Joukanen
change. The organization might not want to rebrand everything, which means that core
characteristics of the brand have to be defined and left unchanged.

2.3.1 Brand Awareness
Brand awareness is, simply put, a measurement of how aware consumers are of a brand.
It measures how well a brand is recognized and remembered by consumers in different
situations. Recognizing a brand is defined as knowing that you have seen the brand or
heard of the brand, while remembering, or recalling, a brand means being able to find
the brand in your memory among others in the same category. (Keller 1993, p. 3.)
The practical reason for having a concept called brand awareness is its effect on the
decision-making process in the minds of consumers. Keller (1993, p.3) explains that in
order for consumers to be able to even consider a certain brand, awareness of it needs to
exist. Why? Because the brand needs to come to consumers’ minds when they are
thinking about the category of the product or service. In addition to that, brand
awareness is crucial when making low-involvement choices where but a few brand
associations have been created. When the consumer does not care which brand she
chooses, she often chooses the one she remembers from somewhere. Finally, awareness
of a brand enables the creation of a brand image and the connection of different
associations to the brand. (Keller 1993, p. 3.)
A research conducted by Huang and Sarigöllü (2012, p. 96) shows a positive correlation
between brand awareness and market outcome. More specifically, it proves a correlation
between brand awareness and sales as well as between brand awareness and market
share. In addition, the research shows that a brand that enjoys a high level of brand
awareness can charge a higher price than its competitors. Esch et al. (2006, p. 100) add
that it is impossible for a consumer to trust or be satisfied by a brand without brand
awareness. These findings stress the relevance of the concept and should drive brands
towards increasing awareness in consumers.

18

2.3.2 Brand Image
Keller (1993, p. 3) defines brand image as:
“Perceptions about a brand as reflected by the brand associations held in
consumer memory.”
In other words, consumers gather pieces of information about a brand and connect them
to form associations whose nature define their feelings towards a brand. Compared to
brand identity – which is an inspirational concept, something a brand aspires to be –
brand image is an evolving concept that describes current associations tied to a brand
(Ghodeswar 2008, p. 6). There are naturally different kinds of brand associations that
can be made, which Keller (1993, p. 3-4) splits into three main categories. The
following paragraphs aim to explain these categories and tie them to relevant examples.
The first category of brand associations is attributes. Consumers use attributes to
describe the product or service in question and what the purchase and consumption of it
means. There are attributes that relate directly to the physical product or service, which
Keller (1993, p. 4) calls product-related, and attributes that are connected to external
features, which he names non-product-related attributes. Product-related attributes are
rather self-explanatory, as they have to do with the physical product or the consumption
of the service. Non-product-related ones, on the other hand, present a wider spectrum of
associations to be made. For example information regarding price, appearance, user
imagery, and usage imagery, can be interpreted as non-product-related attributes (Keller
1993, p. 4). While the further explanation of price and appearance seems redundant,
elaborating upon the imagery of the typical user and usage of the product or service is
called for. User imagery refers to consumers’ notions of who the user of the product or
service in question is. These notions are mainly derived from the brand’s advertising, as
the target segment is often clearly communicated, or at least deducible. Hence, as a
result of interpreting advertisement and talking to others, consumers begin associating
certain brands with certain types of people. Usage imagery, in turn, means associations
that have to do with when or where or how the product or service is consumed. Is the
product used at home, is the service consumed during daytime, etc. These imageryattributes can lead to consumers defining brands by using descriptive adjectives, as a
19

Kalle Joukanen
way of generating a personality for the brand. A brand can be seen, for example, as
being traditional, exciting, or trustworthy (Keller 1993, p. 4). Personality attributes like
these are a much more sustainable means of differentiation than functional productrelated attributes, due to the difficulty of mimicking them (Ghodeswar 2008, p. 5-6).
Physical product or service features can be easy to duplicate, whilst a certain kind of
personality can be near impossible to communicate identically.
An established high-class restaurant might for example be perceived as an expensive
and exclusive place, whose typical user is an economically stable couple in their fifties.
Typical usage imagery might include dimmed lights, fine silverware, stylish clothing
and sophisticated discussions. The brand’s personality could be described as being
luxurious and posh.
The second category is benefits. This category contains the associations that describe
what kind of value consumers feel they are gaining from a product or service. Benefits
can be classified as being functional, experiential, or symbolic. Functional benefits are
the kind that relate to the purpose of a product or service – what kind of a need it fulfills
or what kind of problem it solves. Experiential benefits are associations connected to
using a product or service. They describe the nature of stimulation usage creates and
how using the product or service feels. Symbolic benefits often relate to non-productrelated attributes, as described in the previous segment. The price of the product or
service and its typical user imagery are examples of symbolic benefits consumers seek
to build up their self-image with. (Keller 1993, p. 4.)
A functional benefit of a hotel, for most, is supplying one with lodging for the night.
The consumer needs a place to stay while being away from home. A night at a fine hotel
can make one feel pampered and well taken care of, which can be seen as an
experiential benefit. Choosing to stay at an expensive and trendy hotel might have the
symbolic benefit of adding to one’s goal of establishing a certain kind of social status. If
a consumer wants to create an image of being well off and accustomed to prestigious
things, staying at a hotel that fits the description can be extremely beneficial.
The third and final category is brand attitudes, which describes how consumers feel
about a brand as a whole. Keller (1993, p. 4) stresses the importance of brand attitudes,
20

Kalle Joukanen
as they often are the foundation of consumer behavior. Attitudes can relate to productrelated and non-product-related attributes and play a decisive role in decision-making
situations where consumers are indifferent in the choice of brand. When knowledge
and/or motivation are low, overall attitudes have a considerable effect (Keller 1993, p.
4-5).
On a street with several bars that are all seemingly alike, consumer attitudes can affect
which bar one decides to step into. If one of the bars has provided exceptionally friendly
service before, and thus created positive attitudes amongst consumers, it will likely be
chosen again despite the competition.
Keller (1993, p. 5) cites cognitive psychologists when stating that consumer memory is
very durable, meaning that once an association has been made, it will remain in the
mind of the consumer for a long time. Having several associations connected to a brand
further increases the likelihood of it being remembered in different situations.
Depending on the nature of the market, however, some of the associations in
consumers’ minds might be shared among competitors. They might share some features,
diminishing the positive effect of existing associations. A situation as such is where,
according to Keller (1993, p. 5-6), the positioning of the brand steps into play.
Consumers will choose a brand that has created an advantage through positioning.

2.3.3 Brand Reputation
Brand reputation is a term that describes the combined interpretations different
stakeholders have of a brand that have formed over a long period of time. It is the result
of both past and present actions, interpreted and evaluated by many, meaning that it is a
very stable concept. Hence, reputation works as a great measurement of the brand and
how it is doing (Harris & de Chernatony 2001, p. 445). A positive brand reputation can
prove to be a differentiator in a competitive space, possibly leading to increased
customer loyalty and growth (Ghodeswar 2008, p. 5).

21

Kalle Joukanen
In an ideal situation, where the brand would always have performed exactly as planned,
its reputation would match its identity. If that were the case, all stakeholders would have
interpreted the brand’s vision exactly as management had planned, consumers would
have embraced the brand’s personality, and the brand would have been presented in a
way that matches every stakeholder perfectly. This seldom is the case. Harris and de
Chernatony (2001, p. 445) mean, however, that organizations should strive towards
narrowing the gap between brand identity and brand reputation. Doing so will lead to
desired outcomes and the creation of a strong corporate brand.
The following subchapter will present theory related to the location of a hospitality
industry company. With the case company of this thesis in mind, focus will be put on
urban waterfront areas and brand-related traits that are connected to them.

2.4 Waterfront Location and its Impact on the Brand Image
The case company of this thesis being a restaurant ship floating in the Aura River in
Turku makes discussing the characteristics of urban waterfronts motivated. By
definition, an urban waterfront is the edge of a body of water in a city or town, be it a
river, lake, ocean, bay, creek, or canal (Sairinen & Kumpulainen 2005, p. 121). The
image connected to waterfronts often has a natural effect on the brand image of the
service providers in its immediate vicinity.
The redevelopment of urban waterfronts for a variety of purposes has been active since
the Second World War, after a lot of industrial plants and fields ravaged by war were
left abandoned. In addition, environmental awareness and pressure to fully utilize
central areas in cities and towns have lead to the development of urban waterfronts
during the decades after the war. The goal of such redevelopments is most often a
combination of societal and communal benefits and a sustainable future. Waterfronts in
cities have a considerable impact on the image of the location and on social equity in
the form of high-price real estate. (Sairinen & Kumpulainen 2005, p. 121-122.)

22

Kalle Joukanen
In their research, Sairinen and Kumpulainen (2005, p. 124) identify four social
dimensions of urban waterfront regeneration. In simpler terms, they have grouped the
different kinds of uses, characteristics, and impacts of waterfront areas according to
their nature. The dimensions are resources and identity, social status, access and
activities, and waterfront experience. By identifying these dimensions and all the
aspects they entail, companies are enabled to utilize the strengths of their location to
build a favorable brand image.
Resources and identity compose the first dimension. This dimension contains
information regarding the characteristics of the waterfront, the resources and strengths
of the area, its impact on the visual and cultural identity of the community, and whether
the community utilizes the waterfront area as part of its identity (Sairinen &
Kumpulainen 2005, p. 128). A couple of the main strengths of the Aura River in Turku
are its length and its central location in the city’s infrastructure. The river and the
riverbank accommodate a vast amount of versatile businesses, which are easily accessed
from any direction. Turku has always embraced the river as a big part of its identity and
promotes it actively in city marketing. It is an indispensable part of the city’s visual
image.
The second dimension is social status. This dimension helps identify for example whom
the waterfront area is designed for and how social and private housing affect the social
status of the area (Sairinen & Kumpulainen 2005, p. 129). The Aura River caters to
every demographic in some way. There are attractions for every age, social group, and
ethnicity. The social status regarding social and private housing can be considered
rather high, since waterfront property is valuable and desired.
Areas and activities are listed as the third dimension of urban waterfront regeneration.
This dimension seeks to identify the accessibility of the waterfront area, logistics, and
facilities provided to enable recreational use of the area (Sairinen & Kumpulainen 2005,
p. 131). The Aura River is accessible by foot nearly everywhere. Vehicle traffic right
next to the riverbank is at some locations restricted, due to large walkways and bicycle
routes. However, most of the businesses in the area are accessible by car.

23

Kalle Joukanen
Sairinen and Kumpulainen (2005, p. 132) list waterfront experience as the fourth and
final dimension. Here, information regarding how people experience the waterfront,
how they interact with the elements, and how they perceive the resources of the area is
gathered. The riverbank in Turku is at its most active during the summer, when nature is
at its finest. Visitors of all kinds enjoy different natural elements along the different
parts of the river. Some parts are closer to nature, while some are more urban.
The Aura River flows through the heart of the city of Turku, splitting it in two
distinctive halves. The river and the riverbank are home to a multitude of restaurants,
bars, cafés, art galleries, shops, and museums, making it a true hotspot for cultural and
leisurely activities for locals and tourists alike. As stated earlier, activity in the vicinity
of the river is at its highest during the summer, but most of the service providers in the
area are open throughout the entire year. The results of a survey conducted in the spring
of 2016 (Lehtinen 2016) show that locals find the riverbank the most wonderful part of
the city of Turku. The majority of 2000 respondents chose the riverbank as their favorite
from among a set of alternatives. Comments from survey participants regarding the
riverbank include:
“The riverbank is especially beautiful in springtime when it’s green. The cafés
by the waterfront are also wonderful.” (Lehtinen 2016)
“The bank of the Aura River defines Turku. Especially during summertime we
gather here [the riverbank] with our friends to spend time.” (ibid.)
“A variety of events are arranged here [the riverbank] and the restaurant ships
are unique.” (ibid.)
It is no surprise that people enjoy the riverbank. Savage et al (2004, p. 214-215) state
that the greater the landscape versatility of a city, the greater the attractiveness towards
visitors and locals. Furthermore, they have found that three kinds of urban spaces attract
tourists the most. They are historic districts, cultural quarters, and linear facilities. By
linear facilities, shopping streets, river embankments, and different trails (constructs
with a linear shape) are implied (Savage et al 2004, p. 215). The Aura River fits into

24

Kalle Joukanen
two of the three space categories, as it is a linear facility and cultural quarters, since so
many cultural sites are located near it.

2.5 Summary
The aim of this chapter was to create an understanding of the relevant components of
corporate branding, while transitioning from internal concepts to more external ones.
Only by understanding the core elements of branding, can a company successfully
rebrand itself and move on to strengthen and develop the new brand. The pre-set aim
was achieved by discussing brand identity, building a brand from within the
organization, employees, brand knowledge, and location.
A brand identity works as a differentiator in the marketplace. It is the source of the
promises, trust, and values that consumers connect with and the factor that induces loyal
behavior. According to the categorization by Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 442),
brand identity consists of six components: vision, culture, positioning, personality,
relationships, and presentation. The common factor between all of them is the
fundamental need for marketing and employee behavior to purvey the core values and
desires of the brand.
Brands are built from inside the organization, which means that the staff is an important
actor in the process. In order to build a strong brand, congruent perceptions about the
brand among staff members are required. The most efficient way of achieving such
congruent perceptions is not necessarily assembling an entirely homogeneous staff from
the beginning, but to start off with a heterogeneous group. Literature suggests, that as
the members of staff interact and communicate with one another on a regular basis,
while being adequately managed, optimal outcomes are gained. Furthermore,
communication within the organization is to be frequent and to go both ways and across
hierarchical levels.
The role of the employees of an organization was also discussed. Employees play an
important part in branding, as they often act as the face of the organization,

25

Kalle Joukanen
communicating the brand to external stakeholders. Management should communicate
the desired identity of the brand to employees, who, in turn, are to embrace it and
channel it to stakeholders.
Brand knowledge is another concept that was presented. It consists of brand awareness
and brand image. Brand awareness measures how well consumers recognize and
remember a brand, while brand image encompasses the associations that consumers
connect to a brand and the feelings they have towards it. Keller (1993, p. 3-4) groups
these associations into attributes, benefits, and attitudes. Brand reputation was stated to
be a good measure of how the brand is doing. Ideally, the gap between a brand’s
identity and its reputation should be as narrow as possible.
Finally, theory regarding the specific location of the case company was presented. As
the restaurant is a ship in the Aura River in Turku, urban waterfronts were discussed.
There are social dimensions to urban waterfronts, which describe characteristics like
strengths, social status, and activities. By harnessing these dimensions, companies are
enabled to utilize the potential posed by their surrounding settings. It was also
established that the Aura River is a popular place among locals and tourists alike and
provides a wide array of possibilities.
This marks the end of the Corporate Branding chapter. The following one will explain
the act of rebranding with the intention of laying a foundation for the empiric research
that follows. Presenting the theoretical aspects of the rebranding process makes
conducting a comprehensive analysis of the upcoming case study possible.

3 REBRANDING
This theoretical chapter caters to the main theme of the thesis – rebranding. The aim is
to define rebranding as a marketing tool and to discuss the positive and negative aspects
of it. Other areas of interest are the drivers of rebranding and the rebranding process as a
whole, which will also be examined in this chapter. Once an understanding of these
concepts has been created, the transition to the case study of this thesis is made possible.
Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 805) define rebranding as:
“The creation of a new name, term, symbol, design, or a combination of them
for an established brand with the intention of developing a differentiated (new)
position in the mind of stakeholders and competitors.”
Rebranding is a brand management tool used to reposition a brand and give it new life
through changing its proposition and marketing aesthetics, such as name and design, to
mention a few. Rebranding is often used as a reaction to changes in the brand’s external
environment (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 804) – something that will be further
discussed in the subchapter devoted to reasons for rebranding.
Rebranding can, according to Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 805-806), be of
evolutionary or revolutionary nature. Evolutionary rebranding is something that
essentially every company does at some point during its lifespan. It involves subtle
changes in positioning and/or marketing aesthetics that might at times be so small that
they are difficult for stakeholders to apprehend. Revolutionary rebranding, on the other
hand, is the kind that produces easily noticeable alterations in positioning and/or
aesthetics. Most often it will include changing the name of the brand, which is one of
the most identifiable changes a company can make. Changing the name of a brand is
often the result of a desire to change its image, which also necessitates repositioning.
(Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 805-806.)
Figure 2 below seeks to illustrate the differences between evolutionary and
revolutionary rebranding.

27

Kalle Joukanen

Figure 2: Rebranding as a continuum (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 805)
Changing the name of a brand repeatedly comes up in literature as one of the core
elements of rebranding. It is an act drastic enough to necessitate other changes as well,
which is why several scholars have put an emphasis on studying it. Daly and Moloney
(2004, p. 30-31) are no exception. They have identified four major ways of changing the
name of a brand as a part of the rebranding process, which are the use of an interim/dual
name, the use of a prefix, substituting a name, and brand amalgamation.
The first option, an interim/dual name, is one that is used when a brand takes over
another. Immediately after the merger, the newly created combined brand uses an
interim name consisting of the two separate old ones put together. After a while, the
name of the overtaken brand is entirely scratched in favor of that of the overtaking one.
(Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 31.)
The prefix strategy is used when two or more brands merge and the intention is to create
an entirely new brand name. Here, the new brand name is added as a prefix to each of
the separate old ones for a period of time in order to transfer attributes and values to the
new brand. After some time has passed, the old names are removed and only the new
remains. (Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 31.)

28

Kalle Joukanen
Substitution is the third way of changing a brand’s name. This strategy means changing
the old name of a brand to an entirely different one. Although the name would indicate a
crude, swift change of name, management should carefully plan the switch in order not
to damage the connection consumers have with the old brand name. The substitution
should be accompanied by adequate and clear communication if damage is to be
avoided. (Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 31.)
Brand amalgamation is the fourth alternative. The optimal situation for using this
method is the merger of two strong brands. Here, the separate names are combined as to
connect the benefits and values of each brand and thus creating something much bigger.
It is in other words a lot like an interim/dual name, but without the intent of eventually
erasing the other part. (Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 31-32.)
Furthermore, when discussing different ways to rebrand, rebranding can also be done at
different hierarchical levels within a company. It can be done at a corporate-, business
unit-, or product level, or at several at a time (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 806). In a
hospitality industry context, a proper example of this phenomenon would be a restaurant
concern. Corporate rebranding would affect the positioning and/or aesthetics of the
concern, business unit rebranding would affect those of an individual daughter unit
(restaurant), and product rebranding would mean the rebranding of a signature dish.

3.1 Controversy
The act of rebranding aims, of course, to be a fruitful endeavor, but it involves high risk
and can prove to be rather costly. Changing the name of a brand, for example, erases all
of the value tied to the old name and throws out work that has been done over several
years (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 804). As stakeholders’ interpretations of a brand
are formed by all the signals it sends, rebranding can be seen as a controversial act. By
making changes to a brand’s position or marketing aesthetics, the signals change and
the built-up value of past endeavors may cease to exist. Furthermore, changing a
brand’s name throws out name awareness and all positive (or negative, for that matter)
associations linked to it (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 807). Branca and Borges (2011,

29

Kalle Joukanen
p. 176) add that routinized purchase behavior induced by the old brand can also change
as a result of rebranding.
Another contradiction regarding the act of rebranding becomes clear when it is
compared to the act of corporate branding. Branding is a long-term process, which is the
sum of the actions of the entire organization during a lengthy period of time. It requires
longevity and the synchronized activities of a multitude of individuals. Rebranding, in
contrast, is often a decision made solely by top management and one that can be
implemented in a short period of time. (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 808.)
These risks and controversies should by no means stop organizations from rebranding.
Management should simply be aware of them and know what they are getting into as
they initiate a rebranding process.

3.2 Reasons for Rebranding
A study conducted by Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 808-809) shows the most
common reasons for rebranding among companies from a variety of different industries.
Their research shows no evidence of any specific industry being exceptionally
susceptible to rebranding, but there are noticeable trends and similarities regarding
reasons behind the act.
Study shows that decisions, events, or processes that lead to a big change in a
company’s structure, strategy, or performance are the main reasons behind rebranding.
An increase in competitiveness on the market is an example of an event that requires
such decision-making (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 810). It seems only natural, that
once a company is forced to alter its corporate structure or core performance, it makes
changes on the marketing front as well. The company will want to communicate its
changes to stakeholders through rebranding efforts.
Although reasons for rebranding are many and cases are to some extent individual,
Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p. 810) have been able to narrow them down to four main

30

Kalle Joukanen
categories. The categories are change in ownership structure, change in corporate
strategy, change in competitive position, and change in external environment. Changes
in ownership structure are for example mergers and initial public offerings (IPOs),
while changes in corporate structure might have to do with internationalization or
diversification. A company’s competitive position might change due to shrinking
market share or an outdated image, and finally, changes in a company’s external
environment can relate to laws and legislations or national crises (Muzellec & Lambkin
2006, p. 810). The case company of this thesis fits mainly into the third category of
reasons behind rebranding, changes in competitive position. The second category,
changes in corporate strategy, is another one that the company can, to some extent, be
tied to. The empiric part of this thesis will delve deeper into the subject and attempt to
provide a practical example of how reasons for rebranding are identified and acted
upon.
As a result of examining a variety of studies on the causes of rebranding, Tevi and
Otubanjo (2013, p. 87-88) have found that causes are either internal or external. Internal
reasons for rebranding are the ones relating to, for example, a company’s structure,
image, and personality, while reasons such as increased competition, stakeholder
perceptions, and changes in the market are external. This line of thought would hence
label the first and second of Muzellec and Lambkin’s (2006, p. 810) categories of
reasons for rebranding internal, and the third and fourth external.
As most of the reasons for rebranding are non-marketing-related, the importance of
marketing often goes unnoticed. While an IPO may initiate the rebranding process,
stakeholder communication, brand vision, and brand values are some of the marketing
elements that measure whether the process was successful (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006,
p. 813). Marketing is required to implement changes and to determine their effects –
that is why it is a significant part of the process.

3.3 The Rebranding Process

31

Kalle Joukanen
A study conducted by Tevi and Otubanjo (2013, p. 91) compares an organization’s
rebranding process with the theory of evolution by natural selection. The endeavor
might raise eyebrows at first, but turns out to be a relevant comparison that shows
surprising correlations between the separate processes. In their study, the authors also
compare earlier research on the reasons for rebranding with one another to find
commonalities and/or shortcomings. As a result, they developed the following figure:

Figure 3: The new corporate rebranding model based on evolution theory (Tevi &
Otubanjo 2013, p. 91)
The upper row of steps in the figure above illustrates the evolution process, while the
lower row describes the rebranding process of an organization and the actions involved.
Furthermore, it is highlighted that the rebranding process is mostly an internal one,
involving extensive self-exploration and internal decision-making.
The process in the model begins with an examination of the organization’s environment,
to see what the market demands. After that, the organization should evaluate whether it
meets the requirements of the environment. If it does not, it should move on to the third
step and make changes to aspects like position, name, and design in order to thrive.
After that, the organization should present and embrace its new identity and start
working on building its new image. In addition to explaining the process, the model
above stresses the importance of internal activities, and points out that they are an

32

Kalle Joukanen
obligatory step in exposing a new identity to external stakeholders. (Tevi & Otubanjo
2013, p. 91.
Based on their findings and their model, Tevi and Otubanjo (2013, p. 92) give
rebranding a modified definition:
“Corporate rebranding is a continuing process whereby an organization
responds to the dynamics in its business environment by changing its selfidentity in order to survive and thrive.”
What separates this definition from earlier ones is the notion of rebranding being a long
process and the fact that it mentions a reason for the act. It does not delve into the
specific changes that are part of the rebranding process, but simply states that a change
of self-identity is to be made in order to keep going and to do well. The latter terms
(survive, thrive) have a quaint evolutionary-themed feel to them, but that is motivated
by the unique premise of the authors’ study.
Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 34-35) have developed a model for the rebranding process
(figure 4 below) that contains three main steps: analysis, planning, and evaluation. The
authors argue that all marketing planning should begin with an analysis of the
company’s situation and market. In addition to examining the company’s external
situation, it is imperative that the internal atmosphere is looked into as well.
Management’s and employees’ attitudes and perceptions towards the brand should be
determined, in order to get a feel of what the internal landscape looks like prior to
changes being executed. Furthermore, decisions regarding the different elements of the
brand need to be made at this stage. Management has to choose which brand elements
are to be left intact and which ones are to be removed and replaced. (Daly & Moloney
2004, p. 34-35.)
The second step in the model, planning, includes mapping out what kind of changes are
to be made as well as to whom and how they are to be communicated. This stage
involves thorough self-exploration, identification of different outcomes, budgeting,
decisions regarding changing the name of the brand, communications, and picking the
right strategy to implement everything. As did the first step of the process, this one also
33

Kalle Joukanen
stresses the importance of internal communications. In order to successfully venture
through a rebranding process, a company must have the support and commitment of its
staff. To achieve these prerequisites, active communication and training programs are
advocated. Finally, an emphasis should be put on defining the roles of all participants
involved in conducting the rebranding activities. Optimal results are made when each
participant knows her role and is adequately trained for the job. (Daly & Moloney 2004,
p. 34.)
The final step, evaluation, partially overlaps the previous ones, but also rounds out the
entire process. Evaluation of the process is needed in order to identify aspects that have
succeeded and aspects that need adjustment. Failing to evaluate the rebranding process
might lead to mistakes and missed opportunities. In addition to evaluation being the
final step of rebranding, management should conduct evaluations at different stages of
the process. By doing so, they enable themselves to make pre-emptive maneuvers at the
first sign of trouble before it occurs. (Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 34-35.)

34

Kalle Joukanen

Figure 4: Corporate rebranding framework (Daly & Moloney 2004, p. 35)
The two processes explained above (figures 3 and 4) share the same central features.
Both processes begin by examining the external as well as the internal environments of
the brand and identifying the aspects that need to be changed and why it must happen.
After that, changes are made to respond to the results of the examination. The final steps
of the separate processes differ slightly, as the former urges to present and start
developing the newfound identity, while the latter stresses the importance of evaluation.

3.4 Summary and Theoretical Framework
The Rebranding chapter sought to explain the concept of rebranding, its pros and cons,
reasons behind the act, and what the process looks like. This was accomplished through
the examination of a variety of literary sources.

35

Kalle Joukanen
Rebranding means, in all simplicity, making changes to a brand in order to reposition
and invigorate it. It can be done on different hierarchical levels of an organization and it
can be of either evolutionary or revolutionary nature. Evolutionary rebranding involves
subtle changes to the brand, changes that virtually every company does at some point.
Revolutionary rebranding means making noticeable changes in the positioning and/or
marketing aesthetics of the brand. The latter option often involves changing the name of
the brand, which motivated establishing four different ways of conducting the namechange.
There is some controversy tied to rebranding, as it entails destroying all the value tied to
the old brand. Associations of different kinds, positive and negative, are erased as the
brand changes. Compared to corporate branding, which is a long-term endeavor that
involves the participation of the entire organization, rebranding is a much shorter
process and can be conducted by but a handful of individuals.
One subchapter was dedicated to exploring the reasons for rebranding. They were found
to be of either internal or external nature. In addition, Muzellec and Lambkin (2006, p.
810) have grouped the main reasons for rebranding into four categories based on their
research: change in ownership structure (internal), change in corporate strategy
(internal), change in competitive position (external), and change in external
environment (external). Although the fundamental reasons for rebranding are mostly
related to the structure or performance of the company, they always require changes on
the marketing front as well. The fact that changes that are made are communicated
through marketing further emphasizes the importance of it.
Two models of the rebranding process were thoroughly examined in this chapter. The
first one, by Tevi and Otubanjo (2013, p. 91), compares rebranding with the theory of
evolution by natural selection. The five main steps of the model, in short, are
examination of the environment, self-assessment, repositioning and readjustment,
presentation of the new identity, and developing the new identity. This model stresses
that rebranding is a continuous process that requires responsiveness and the ability to
adapt.

36

Kalle Joukanen
The second model that was presented, by Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 35) is a threestep model whose parts not only succeed one another, but overlap as well. The first step
is analyzing the external and internal environments and atmospheres of the brand and
identifying relevant brand elements. The second step involves making decisions on
what changes to execute, how to communicate both externally and internally, and
defining the roles of participants involved in the process. The third and final step is
evaluation, which is needed in order to adjust and fix the process. Evaluations should be
made during the process and at the end of it.
Based on the entire literature review, figure 5 presents the theoretical framework of this
thesis. It is a rebranding model created by the author, which seeks to combine the most
essential aspects of the theory presented, mainly utilizing the models by Tevi and
Otubanjo (2013, p. 91) and Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 35) as reference. This new
model, the Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model (figure 5), follows the general
order of the model by Tevi and Otubanjo (2013, p. 91), but combines the two initial
steps together, as they are perceived as one internal activity. Combining the two is
motivated by the notion that the simultaneous analysis of internal and external aspects is
required for planning and decision-making. This combined step, however, is preceded
by a step identified in the model by Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 35). The final step of
Tevi and Otubanjo’s model is dismissed, as it focuses on the time after the rebranding
process is finished. The step is dismissed in order to narrow the focus on the process
itself. The final step of the new model, final evaluation, is derived from Daly and
Moloney’s (2004, p. 35) model.

Figure 5: Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model (based on Tevi and Otubanjo
(2013, p. 91) and Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 35))
This model presents the five main steps of the rebranding process, as identified in the
literature review. The following paragraphs will elaborate on each one.
The process begins at Step 1, where the relevant characteristics of the old brand are
identified. Positive and negative associations connected to the brand, core values, and
brand knowledge are among the characteristics that are to be examined. This is a step
that is conducted internally by management. The objective is to identify which
characteristics are beneficial and which are detrimental, in order to later decide on
which ones, if any, are to be kept intact.
Step 2 is where the internal and external environments of the brand are to be examined,
so as to determine whether the brand is performing adequately. If it is not, management
is to determine why. Thus, the reason for rebranding is identified. In addition, during
Step 2, management should plan the rebranding changes that are going to be made and
set targets for the new brand, based on their analysis. Step 2 is also an internal one.
Step 3 is where the planned changes are executed. As discussed in the literature review,
it is imperative that the changes that are made during the rebranding process are
communicated both externally and internally. The employees of the company need to
have a coherent perception of the new brand in order to act accordingly and purvey the
new identity to external stakeholders. Furthermore, Step 3 is where the roles of each
individual involved in the process are determined. The logical dividing of assignments
and good communication are needed in order to successfully execute all changes. The
actions made during this step can be of an internal and external nature, as changes can
be for example revamping the corporate culture or renewing the brand logo.
When all of the planned rebranding actions have been made, it is time to move on to
Step 4. Step 4 is where the new brand is presented to external stakeholders of all kinds
and its new life begins. This is where a potential re-launch happens and where the
development of the new brand is initiated. The arrows connected to this step point out
38

Kalle Joukanen
the fact that the new brand is affected by newly created associations as well as old ones
that remained.
Finally, the entire process should be evaluated in Step 5. A final, comprehensive
evaluation of the rebranding process allows for management to see if pre-set goals were
achieved and whether additional changes need to be made. It is to be noted, however,
that the model suggests that evaluations be made throughout the rebranding process as
well. By conducting staged evaluations at different times during the process,
management enables making alterations and measurements before it is too late.
In addition to presenting the steps of the process, this model aims to point out the fact
that rebranding is to a great extent an interplay between internal and external processes
for companies, albeit with an emphasis on the internal ones. Decision-making, building
brand identity, and evaluation are internal activities that make up most of the process.
The horizontal bars at the top of the model seek to visualize this fact.
The following chapter will look into the methodology of the upcoming empiric
research. Out of a plethora of different ways to conduct an empiric research, a select
few have been chosen to produce the most relevant findings possible for the specific
case study at hand. Chapter three will present these methods.

4 METHOD
This chapter is dedicated to presenting and motivating the choice of method for
conducting the empiric research that follows. Due to the nature of the case at hand,
where the rebranding process of a single company lies in focus, research methods used
will be of a qualitative kind. The following subchapters aim to explain why qualitative
methods are the most appropriate and efficient option. Moreover, the traits of the main
methods used in this thesis, longitudinal studies, participant observation, and interviews,
will be explained.

4.1 Qualitative Research
The objective of the empiric part of his thesis is to study the rebranding process of the
case company, restaurant ship Cindy, and to suggest a framework for the process that is
applicable to other hospitality industry SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) as
well. The case company will be studied using a combination of the research methods
presented in this chapter. In order to increase the reliability and validity of the findings,
another company that has gone through a rebranding process, restaurant Daily Bistro,
will be examined through the use of interviews. As gaining an in-depth understanding
of the two companies’ perspectives on rebranding and all the activities that rebranding
entails are the main focus of the empiric part of this thesis, qualitative research methods
are motivated.
Qualitative research is one of two ways of gathering primary data. It is an unstructured,
exploratory research method that concentrates on small samples, providing an in-depth
understanding of the issue at hand. The other option, quantitative research, is a
structured method used to gather and analyze large quantities of data to produce
statistical results. The two methods can be used separately or as complements to each
other. (Malhotra 2007, p. 143.)
The unstructured nature of qualitative research allows for the researcher to acquire
answers that for example a structured, quantitative online survey would not yield.
40

Kalle Joukanen
Respondents might be reluctant to answer sensitive questions if they are posed too
formally. Furthermore, questions that involve the values, emotions, and motivations of a
person can only be answered using an unstructured approach (Malhotra 2007, p. 144145). These traits are required in this particular research, where the underlying thoughts
and feelings of the individuals involved play a significant part in decision-making.
Malhotra (2007, p. 145) explains that qualitative research can be either direct or
indirect. Using a direct approach, the researcher reveals the objective of the study to the
respondent. An indirect approach, on the other hand, means disguising the underlying
objective of the study in order to induce subconscious answers. The empiric research of
this thesis applies a direct approach, since the subconscious of the respondents is not of
interest. The aim is to clearly present the objective of the research to each respondent
and obtain rational, informative answers.

4.1.1 Participant Observation
Participant observation was chosen as one of the qualitative research methods because it
allows for a very close examination of the main study object (case company), restaurant
ship Cindy. Partaking in some of the rebranding activities in the process and interacting
closely with those involved enabled gathering valuable data and gaining a kind of
insight into the process, which, for example, interviews alone would not have. The fact
that the CEO of the case company is the father of the author made participating
possible. The observation was done over a five-month period, from January to May
2017.
Participant observation is what often is referred to as fieldwork in research-related
contexts (DeWalt et al. 2002, p. 259). It is a study method that is generally connected to
anthropological research, but is widely applicable in a variety of different research.
DeWalt et al. (2002, p. 260) explain that in participant observation an observer takes
part in the activities, interactions, and events of the people (or company) that are
studied. By doing so, the observer utilizes a natural way of collecting the kind of tacit
and explicit data that more structured and formal manners would not yield.

41

Kalle Joukanen
Furthermore, DeWalt et al. (2002, p. 264) argue that participant observation produces
data of high quality and enables a high-leveled analysis of it.
The name of the research method, participant observation, can cause some confusion
due to the two separate words contradicting one another. The first word, participation,
means close involvement with the study object, while the other word, observation,
means watching from a distance, not interfering. Nevertheless, the method has been
found to produce great results for several decades (Tedlock 1991, p. 69).
DeWalt et al. (2002, p. 262) have identified different ways of engaging in participant
observation based on the degree of participation involved by the researcher.
Nonparticipation is the most passive way, which involves reading or hearing about the
study object or watching it through other media channels. Nonparticipation does not
include any active interaction with the people or company being studied. The next level
is called moderate participation. Here, the researcher sporadically visits the location
where the study objective goes about its business and occasionally interacts in different
ways. Active participation is the second highest level of participation, where the
researcher is almost constantly present and takes part in virtually everything that
happens. The highest level is called complete participation. At this level, as put by
DeWalt et al. (2002, p. 263), the researcher “is or becomes a member of the group that
is being studied”. (DeWalt et al. 2002, p. 262-263.)
The degree of participation in this particular research can be labeled as moderate
participation, as the researcher visited the physical locations of the case company from
time to time and sporadically interacted with the people involved. Although Tedlock
(1991, p. 71) preaches that the notion of participation interfering with the objectivity of
the study is false, an adequate emotional detachment from the study object was
deliberate due to the family connection between the CEO of the case company and the
author of this thesis. An explicit focus on objective writing was kept so as to avoid
generating subjective findings. The humane urge to emphasize positives and neglect
negatives was subdued by treating the case company as any other company in order to
present valid and true results.

42

Kalle Joukanen
Establishing so called rapport, a kind of positive chemistry and mutual trust, with the
people (employees of a company) being studied, is required in order to generate good
results. Rapport is found when people share the same goals and contribute towards
achieving them together. It requires communication, trust, and commitment (DeWalt et
al. 2002, p. 267-269). Things such as the researcher’s personal biases, preconceptions,
and personal characteristics can, however, distort establishing rapport and conducting
participant observation. Ridding one self from such traits, observing carefully, and
being a good listener are some of the guidelines to making participant observation work
(DeWalt et al. 2002, p. 266-267).
It is worth mentioning that the language used during the participant observation was
mainly Finnish, since it is the work language within the case company.

4.1.2 Interviews
Qualitative interviews, also referred to as depth interviews, are an unstructured and
direct qualitative research method whose purpose is to obtain data like motivations,
beliefs, and feelings on a topic. They are conducted one-on-one and generally last 30-60
minutes. It is a technique that allows for the posing of follow-up questions and the
unearthing of answers that the respondent might be unwilling to answer or incapable of
identifying at first (Malhotra 2007, p. 158-159). Bryman (2002, p. 299) adds that
interviews are the most popular of qualitative research methods, which is likely due to
the flexibility they offer.
Naturally, there are advantages as well as disadvantages to every research method.
What matters is finding the one method, or combination of methods, best suitable for
each study. Malhotra (2007, p. 161) mentions a few of the disadvantages of depth
interviews, the most significant of which is the challenge of interpreting data. The
unstructured nature of interviews and the fact that discussions can get personal and
sensitive, increase the amount of analysis and interpretation done by the interviewer.
Arriving at the correct conclusions require a tremendous amount of skill. Another
disadvantage concerns the more professional type of depth interviews, where the cost of

43

Kalle Joukanen
hiring professional interviewers and psychologists can prove rather large (Malhotra
2007, p. 161). Recording each interview and re-listening to them several times made
interpreting data very manageable, however. It enabled the author to notice tones of
voice, hesitations, and laughter, leading to reliable results. No professionals were hired,
eliminating the monetary downsides presented above.
Advantages of the method are many. Interviewing only one person means a free
exchange of information and provides deep understanding of the problem setting.
Because only one person is involved, there is no group pressure and every answer can
be credited to the correct person. Individual interviews also enable discussions with
people who are competitors in the same market and allow for uncovering hidden
motives that structured questions would not. Examples of situations where interviews
are especially favorable are such where confidential or sensitive topics are being
discussed, complex behavior needs to be understood, or where the consumption of a
product affects emotions. (Malhotra 2007, p. 161-162.)
Qualitative interviews need not always be entirely unstructured. Instead of letting the
discussion between the interviewer and the respondent flow entirely freely, a semistructured approach can be applied. In a semi-structured interview, the interviewer
follows a certain line of questioning, but may veer from it, change the order of the
questions, and add questions as the discussion develops. (Bryman 2002, p. 301.)
The interviews made in the empiric research of this thesis were semi-structured, which
is motivated by the desire to gain a deep insight into the relevant subjects, while
maintaining control of each discussion. The aim was to obtain fruitful findings by
holding on to a certain theme and by asking predetermined questions, but also by
allowing for free and flexible interaction. They were conducted in Swedish and Finnish,
depending on the native language of the respondent. Each interview was transcribed and
translated into English for the sake of ensuring true and clear results.
The following table presents the interviews that were conducted. Respondents, their
position in the company, and the time, duration, and language of the interviews are
displayed.

4.2 Longitudinal Study
The empiric study of this thesis can be categorized as a longitudinal one, as restaurant
Cindy along with its management and employees were observed during a lengthy period
of time. During this period of time, the restaurant went through a rebranding process
that was observed and documented by the author. This chapter will explain the traits of
the research method and why it is used.
A longitudinal study is one that utilizes a longitudinal research method, which is
defined by Cherry (2017) as an observational research that examines variables, or study
objects, over an extended period of time. The length of the time period can range from
weeks to decades. Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010, p. 97) add that a longitudinal
research is a study of change that requires at least three separate observations of the
study objects for the data to be valid. The more observations, the better results.
The primary reason for conducting a longitudinal study is to explain how and why a
certain outcome is reached. By repeatedly observing the same study objects, such as
individuals, teams, or organizations, at different points in time, changes can be found.
These findings can then be used to explain causal effects and perhaps predict future
developments. (Ployhart & Vandenberg 2010, p. 97.)

45

Kalle Joukanen
Longitudinal studies are notably fruitful when examining a developmental process. As
time passes and things transpire, the researcher is enabled to identify sequences and key
acts that affect the outcome (Cherry 2017). Additional benefits of the research method
include the fact that all events during the study period are recorded, and that separate
patterns of change can be studied at once (Unknown, p. 2). The two main disadvantages
of the research method are perceived to be the potential expensiveness of such a study
and the risk of participant dropouts (Cherry 2017). A study that takes years can
potentially be costly and study objects dropping out in the middle of a project could
lead to misleading and inconclusive results. These downsides, however, did not affect
the study of this particular thesis, as it only lasted a few months and the study objects
(restaurant Cindy, its management and employees) were entirely vested in the process
and had no intentions of dropping out.
A longitudinal study fits this thesis very well, as the rebranding process of restaurant
Cindy that lasted for approximately five months, from January to May, is in focus. By
making observations of the kinds of steps that are taken during the process at different
points in time and seeing how everything is done from start to finish, conclusions
regarding how various inputs lead to the final outcome can be drawn. At the end, the
process can be explained in detail and the findings can be used to determine future
actions.

4.3 Narrative Analysis
Narrative analysis was chosen as the method of analyzing the gathered data. Narrative,
in this instance, refers to the stories told by the interviewees and the observed evolution
of the case company. These narratives provide an explanation to why certain things are
the way they are and how the individuals involved experience them. A narrative
analysis attempts to explain something that has occurred or something that an
interviewee, for example, believes to have occurred (Bamberg 2012, p. 3).
There are several different manners in which individuals present themselves and their
experiences when they speak. They can express themselves in different languages and

46

Kalle Joukanen
through a variety of mannerisms, non-verbal communication, and metaphors, which
might not always be easy to interpret. Narrative analysis as a research method aims to
make sense of such subjective data and translate it into a form that is less complicated.
(Burck 2005, p. 252-253.)
A study like this particular one, where only a handful of meaningful persons of interest
are interviewed – as opposed to one where study objects are several and less significant
– can greatly benefit from narrative analysis. Creating an amicable relationship between
the interviewer and the interviewee is made possible in a study like this, which makes
catching subtle details and interpreting the interviewee correctly possible (Riessman
2005, p. 6).
The narrative analysis of this study began by re-reading the transcribed interviews that
had been conducted in order to obtain a grasp of the narrative. The second step was to
organize the narratives into a timeline, pinpointing the most essential findings in the
process and writing them down. Chapter five of the thesis represents this step. The final
phase of the narrative analysis will be put into practice in the sixth chapter of this thesis,
where the gathered data is analyzed and discussed.

4.4 Validity of Findings
Due to the dynamic and subjective nature of qualitative research, building validity
throughout the research is called for. Validity, in essence, measures the truthfulness and
trustworthiness of the research – from gathering data to analyzing it and presenting
findings. Without validity a research lacks in quality and acceptability (Zohrabi 2013, p.
258).
In order to achieve validity, one or preferably a combination of the following methods
can be used: triangulation, member checks, long-term observation at research site, peer
examination, participatory or collaborative modes of research, and researcher’s bias
(Zohrabi 2013, p. 258). Each method is briefly elaborated upon below.

47

Kalle Joukanen
Gathering data through the use of one technique only can be inadequate and provide
unreliable results. That is why triangulation – the use of several techniques – is
recommended. The data from different techniques strengthen one another. A qualitative
research could make use of a combination of for example interviews, observations of
different kinds, and focus groups (Zohrabi 2013, p. 258). In this study, a mixture of
qualitative interviews and participant observation is utilized.
According to Zohrabi (2013, p. 258), member checks means returning to a research
participant and essentially having them check whether the data they provided earlier is
valid. This could mean presenting a dissected and analyzed interview to the interviewee
for her to confirm. This method was partly used in this particular study when the CEO
of the case company was interviewed twice. Some topics were revisited during the
second time.
Peer examination, as defined by Zohrabi (2013, p. 259), means having the research data
and findings examined by peers who understand the subject but do not participate in the
research at hand. The opinions and input of such peers can have an extensive effect on
the validity of the research. This method was put into use by presenting this thesis to
Master’s student peers during seminars and exchanging thoughts on the topic.
Participatory or collaborative modes of research, in turn, are explained as having
research participants participate in as many facets of the research as possible. By doing
so, participants gain an apprehensive understanding of the research and thus make for
useful assistants to the researcher. Being able to share ideas and exchange thoughts with
others during the process can prove beneficial to the final outcome (Zohrabi 2013, p.
259). This study made use of this method, as the main participants, CEO Joukanen and
restaurant manager Turunen, took part in and acted as main drivers of most of the
phases in the rebranding process of the case company.
The sixth and final method of gaining validity is called researcher’s bias. It implies
disregarding ones personal values and feelings in order to produce impartial and
unbiased findings. Maintaining a critical, but honest grasp on the research while
keeping an emotional distance is the only way to build validity (Zohrabi 2013, p. 259).
An impartial and objective approach to this study was successfully maintained to the
48

Kalle Joukanen
very end despite the author’s close family connection to the case company. Not only
would bias have been counterproductive to this study, it could – through the author’s
participation – have had a derogatory effect on the entire rebranding process of the case
company.

5 EMPIRIC STUDY
The purpose of this chapter is to present the findings of the case study that has been
conducted. The aim is to objectively bring forth the results from all phases of the study:
the interviews and the participant observation. During the active part of the rebranding
process of restaurant ship Cindy, which lasted for approximately five months, three
depth interviews were conducted in addition to the participatory observing that regularly
took place during the entire timespan. A fourth interview with the CEO of another
restaurant that has gone through a rebranding process, restaurant Daily Bistro, was
conducted in order to provide an additional perspective on the topic and to add validity
to this thesis.
The order of this chapter will mostly be chronological. The rebranding process of Cindy
in its entirety will be presented first, from start to finish, followed by the additional
interview with the CEO of Daily Bistro.
First, the results of an initial interview with the CEO of Cindy, Ilkka Joukanen, will be
presented. After that, an explanation of the participant observation and all it entails will
follow. Third is the interview with Cindy’s restaurant manager, Tomi Turunen,
followed by a concluding interview with CEO Joukanen. Finally, the interview with
Daily Bistro CEO Anders von Schantz will be presented.

5.1 Cindy’s Former Brand and Reasons for Rebranding
The interview with Ilkka Joukanen, the CEO of restaurant ship Cindy, took place in his
office in Turku January 9th. The main topics of this initial interview were Joukanen’s
career, the history of Cindy, motives behind the rebranding process, and what kind of
changes were going to be made.
The interview began by briefly discussing Joukanen’s career to date and the path that
had lead him to where he is now, professionally. He explained, that his career in the
restaurant business began in 1973 when he started working summers in the kitchen of a
50

Kalle Joukanen
cruise ship called Fennia. His first full-time employer was a restaurant in Åland, where
he worked as a server after graduating. After a few years of working and earning a
degree from the hotel-restaurant institute of Haaga, he became head waiter at hotel
Marina Palace in Turku in 1979. It turned out to be a brief visit. The year after,
Joukanen started doing sales at a rival hotel in the city, Hamburger Börs. After a few
years he was promoted to hotel manager.
In 1988 a fear of stagnating had crept into Joukanen’s mind and he started thinking
about having a business of his own. He found a likeminded partner in the head chef of
Hamburger Börs, Jussi Kinnunen, with whom he established hotel Nukkumatti in
Turku. The business partners ran the hotel together through ups and downs for a little
more than ten years. During this time, they expanded onto the restaurant business as
well, establishing two restaurant ships, Cindy and Lulu, and a pub called El Paso.
The partnership of Joukanen and Kinnunen, however, had been deteriorating for some
time in the early 2000s, which lead to them splitting ways in 2003. Kinnunen kept
possession of Lulu and El Paso, while Joukanen continued with restaurant ship Cindy.
Since then, Joukanen’s business has grown with a Spanish restaurant called Tomate,
which was sold some years ago, and a pub called Mallaskukko, which he still runs.
Once Joukanen and Kinnunen had purchased restaurant ship Lulu in 1998, they were
made aware of a barge that lay aimlessly in the harbor of Pansio. It was in poor shape,
but could potentially be reconstructed into a restaurant. The partners purchased the
barge in the beginning of 1999 and had it reconstructed and moved to the Aura River in
Turku by May the same year. They were not able to finish the lower deck, however, so
during the first summer only drinks were served on deck. In the fall of 1999 they
completed the restaurant on the lower level and opened it for business as well.
“Our intention from the very start was to make it into a high-quality restaurant.
Since all the other ships were focused on serving beer during summers only, we
wanted to serve great food all year long.” (Joukanen 2017a)

51

Kalle Joukanen
Focus had been on high-quality near-produced food and fine wine. Joukanen articulated
that the kind of “fine dining” concept Cindy had been employing was mainly planned
for fall, winter, and spring, the seasons during which the deck of the ship was not open.
On the topic of reasons behind the rebranding process, Joukanen began by stating that
one needs to view the summer season and the winter season as separate phenomena, and
that winters had never been outstanding. Once the financial crisis hit Finland, the
situation deteriorated further.
“The concept we have had, the kind of “old-fashioned” restaurant operation we
have been running, was mainly designed for winter and it no longer works.”
(Joukanen 2017a)
He went on to state that making a change had already crossed his mind in the spring of
2016, but he had not fully committed. He elaborated that he had had trouble deciding on
what changes to make and that he had realized the amount of work and resources
rebranding requires, which lead to delaying the process.
Joukanen’s reasons for rebranding became even clearer when he was asked about how
Cindy’s target audience was going to change as a result of the upcoming changes. He
pointed out that the restaurant had been targeting a slightly older audience during
winter, age 25-30 and older, the traditionalists who appreciate fine food and wine.
“It is the most challenging target group of all. There are not a lot of them and it
is difficult to get them to come to the riverbank during winter when nothing else
is going on there.” (Joukanen 2017a)
In the summer, Cindy’s target audience had been slightly younger, but not as young as
that of some of the more lively competitors. Now, the intention is to target the so-called
“trend setters”, as Joukanen described them. In other words, people in or around their
twenties, people who enjoy having fun and relaxing and who appreciate drinks of
different varieties and easy-going food.

52

Kalle Joukanen
Regarding marketing channels – ones Cindy has been utilizing until now and ones that
are to be used in the future – Joukanen told that there is going to be a stronger focus on
social media and Cindy’s own website. Cindy had been using ads in local newspapers,
but Joukanen felt they no longer suffice.
“At least when considering our customers during summer, newspaper ads do not
work. Neither tourists nor youngsters read newspapers. You [interviewer] and
your friends do not read newspapers.” (Joukanen 2017a)
He went on to state that he wants to utilize social media more than before, but that he
does not feel comfortable doing it himself.
“My problem is that I do not understand social media, but I strongly believe in
it. That is where we must be active.” (Joukanen 2017a)
Another important part of Cindy’s marketing, according to Joukanen, is the outer
appearance of the ship. The ship needs to look appealing and in itself work as a tool to
invite customers.
The discussion shifted towards the restaurant market in Turku and by the Aura River.
Joukanen explained that the market is a lively one, with new restaurants being opened
regularly. He noted that the kind of trendy theme Cindy will strive towards is very
popular and that the old-fashioned concept is dying. Regarding the riverbank, he stated
that there is fierce competition, but that it is not solely negative. Competition keeps
entrepreneurs on their toes and provides consumers with several benefits. He would not
like to be the only restaurant by the river, as the entire concept of the Aura River is
created by the wide supply of services.
The main topic of the interview would follow: the upcoming rebranding process of
restaurant ship Cindy and what it would entail. Joukanen felt that the largest changes
would happen on the lower level of the ship. The deck would mostly remain the same,
except for the addition of a few pieces of furniture, better music equipment and more
live music. The lower level was to be made more relaxed and inviting. Long dining
tables and formal table settings would be removed and substituted by some sofas and a
53

Kalle Joukanen
more relaxed décor. The menu would also be comprised into fewer options than before
and dishes would be less formal. The aim would be to attract people to enjoy
themselves with nice beverages and bistro-type food without the stiff feel of a threecourse meal. Joukanen emphasized that fine wine and food would still be served, only
to a slighter extent.
Changes first started happening in the fall of 2015, but remained few due to decisionmaking troubles and lacking resources. Changes that were made for the summer of 2016
went wrong and were not fully completed. Joukanen said that he had had trouble finding
adequate personnel for the summer and that the restaurant’s menu had not turned out as
hoped. The bar counter on the lower level of the ship, however, was one of the
successful changes of that year. The updated look and location of the counter had been
positively embraced by customers and was more practical for the employees. Now that
Joukanen has decided on what to do and has a better supporting cast surrounding him,
he feels confident.
Joukanen was then inquired about the roles of the individuals participating in the
process. He said that the he and Cindy’s restaurant manager, Tomi Turunen, would
drive the process with the additional help of his son, the interviewer and author of this
thesis.
“I would say Tomi is in a leading role here. I want to give him the chance to
show what he is capable of. I want to be in the background, taking care of the
physical stuff. You [interviewer] will then help with marketing.” (Joukanen
2017a)
Regarding challenges, Joukanen expected a few. The initial financial investments that
would be required to complete the process were one. Not knowing how the changes
would turn out was the other one. He did state, however, that if the outcome were good,
it would sell itself. A final quote would wrap his mentality up pretty well:
“I want us to be the absolute most attractive ship in the entire river. No less than
that.” (Joukanen 2017a)

5.2 The Rebranding Process of Cindy
Thanks to the author’s family relation to the CEO of Cindy, close participant
observation was enabled. The author has also previously been an employee of the
restaurant, making the setting very familiar. In this subchapter, the nature of the
author’s participation and the findings made during the different activities will be
presented in chronological order. The activities ranged from January 2017 to May 2017
and occurred sporadically. Instead of exact dates, the time of each activity will be
presented in weeks. The reasons for this are that it is visually clearer and that several
activities lasted for consecutive days, making weeks a more accurate measure.
The process started in Week 1 with an initial meeting between CEO Ilkka Joukanen
(from here on referred to only as Joukanen), restaurant manager Tomi Turunen, and the
author. The meeting was held at the office of Joukanen and the purpose was to begin the
process by discussing the desired direction. Joukanen spoke about the unfinished and
failed changed of the previous summer and made it clear that there was a need for
additional ones. He explained that he needed assistance with the changes and hoped that
his two trustees would be up for the job. They agreed, so the discussion continued on to
formulating the desired new brand. Joukanen told his initial vision, which was then
added to by Turunen and the author. Turunen seemed to have been thinking along the
same lines, since his initial thoughts regarding the furniture, food, and drinks
immediately matched with those of Joukanen. The author provided his thoughts
regarding style elements like music and employee clothing, as well as marketing
aspects. The main thought was to make sure everything is aligned with the brand and
that all facets communicate the same thing.
Joukanen said he had already been planning on making a slight change to the name and
logo of Cindy, which Turunen and the author felt was a good idea. He wanted the logo,
which had previously read “Restaurant Ship Cindy” to read “Bar & Bistro Cindy” or
“Bistro & Bar Cindy”. He had not yet made up his mind, but after pondering together,
the three decided on the former option. Having the word bar come first would more
clearly communicate the change in theme they were looking for. The drawn ship and the

55

Kalle Joukanen
beautifully written name Cindy would remain the same. Joukanen would ask the ad
agency that had been doing Cindy’s marketing for a while to draw up a few suggestions
for the typeface of the new logo.
After a few weeks of Joukanen dealing with other things, the logo matter was brought
up again Week 7. Out of the alternatives presented by the ad agency, the logo selected
as the author’s favorite was chosen. As per Turunen’s request, the typeface was slightly
heightened in order to match the picture better. Below are the old logo and the new
logo.

The week after, Week 8, Joukanen, Turunen, and the author briefly met at Cindy to pick
out new furniture for the deck of the ship. Joukanen wanted to add some high tables and
stools for customers to sit and stand around, and had a brochure out of which
alternatives were examined. Black tables and stools that matched the style of existing
sofas on the deck of Cindy were settled upon and ordered. A respectful cooperation
between the three participants made decision-making easy. During this meeting to
Cindy, a few pictures were taken on deck and an initial “awakening” on Cindy’s
Facebook page was made. Together with Turunen, the author changed Cindy’s profile
picture into the renewed logo and posted a picture of the wintery deck in order to raise
consumer attention after a dormant period. Turunen and the author share login
credentials to the social media accounts of Cindy, which are on Facebook and
Instagram. Here is one of the pictures taken before physical changes to the ship took
place:

During the same meeting of Week 8, Turunen made some suggestions regarding DJ
performances on deck during the summer. He felt that some easy-going, lounge-style
music would fit the new brand perfectly. Joukanen liked the idea and urged Turunen to
investigate opportunities. There were initial talks about building a DJ booth in the front
end of the ship where artists could play on weekends. Joukanen noted, however, that he
did not want to buy DJ equipment, but rent instead. It would make more sense
financially.
During Week 11 two tasting sessions with two different drinks importers were arranged
on consecutive days. Out of Cindy’s staff present were Turunen, the manager of the
deck of Cindy, Ruuska, and the author. During the first tasting session the importer
presented a variety of wines and a few spirits, while during the second tasting beers and
ciders were in focus. Based on the desired new brand and theme of Cindy, a few
products from each importer’s portfolio were chosen to be added to the upcoming
summer’s menu. Turunen was mainly in charge for selecting the wines, as they are his
area of expertise, while Ruuska was responsible for beers and ciders. The author
provided his insights into each area and agreed with a lot of the choices made by the
respective experts. There was one red wine in particular that Turunen and the author
57

Kalle Joukanen
both felt would be a perfect match with the cheese platter that had been talked about for
Cindy’s menu.
The author participated in renovations of the bar on Cindy’s deck on Week 13. There
was an old refrigerator that needed to be removed, which required quite a lot of
manpower. The reason for removing it was the cocktail menu that was going to be
expanded. A new counter would later fill the space, making for more suitable working
space for Cindy’s mixologists. Additionally, above the counter a couple of shelves
would be installed, better enabling the showcasing of different spirits and other
beverages served on deck. The picture below is taken after the counter and shelves were
installed.

During Week 17 the author made a couple brief visits to Cindy to help with some of the
decorating and furnishing and to taste some of the dishes and drinks planned for the first
menu. Head chef Leskinen had prepared a draft of the menu, which was noticeably
58

Kalle Joukanen
more concise than the menu of the previous summer. At the time, there were a couple of
blank spaces reserved for weekly specials, which were to be decided upon later. The
author got to meet the last of the new staff and got to know the individuals that were
going to play a vital role in the shaping of Cindy’s new brand. These individuals had
been carefully selected with the new brand in mind – they were professional, yet relaxed
people who would be able to purvey the sought-after image of Bar & Bistro Cindy. The
first opening for the summer of 2017 was set to happen the weekend of Week 17.
During the visits to Cindy, a few pictures were taken of the renewed ship. Points of
interest included the DJ booth on the deck and the sofas of the lower level.

The renewed lower level of Cindy
In the upper picture the new variety of seating options on deck as well as the DJ booth
are visible. There are regular tables and chairs, sofa groups, and some higher tables and
stools. The DJ booth in the end will enable weekend performances of a number of
musical artists during the summer. The lower picture presents one of two lounge areas
downstairs. The aim is to attract customers to the lower level as well, without them
feeling the pressure to dine. Dining tables still exist for that purpose, however.
The author participated in the rebranding process during Weeks 17 and 18 by creating a
social media calendar for Cindy. The purpose of the calendar was to create a guiding
schedule for the social media posts of Cindy. It featured the date on which each post
was to be published, the reason for the post, the media platform of choice, and
suggestions for the picture and the featured text of the post. Restaurant manager
Turunen would be in charge of making the actual posts, but the author would assist him
during the summer. Below is a take from the calendar, translated from its original
Finnish language to English for the sake of this thesis. Abbreviations “IG” and “FB” are
for Instagram and Facebook, respectively.

60

Kalle Joukanen

A take from Cindy’s social media calendar
The purpose of a stronger social media presence and publishing posts like the ones in
the social media calendar would be to reach a younger target audience and raise
awareness of the new brand.
The author also participates in the Facebook group of Cindy’s employees. Being a
member of the group makes observing the internal communication of the staff possible.
Turunen initiated all discussions and participation has been active. Discussions have
been revolving around the preparations that were made before Cindy opened and
coordination of meetings. Turunen has also made several situational updates to aspects
regarding suppliers, schedules, and things still to be done. He has posted instructions for
making the cocktails of Cindy’s drinks menu for employees to study and asked the
group for name suggestions for the cocktails. Out of the 12 employees of Cindy, 9 are
members of the Facebook group. The remaining three individuals are not users of the
platform and receive information through other means.
Finally, a presentation of Cindy’s renewed website. Turunen outsourced the project to a
company that designs websites early in the year and they were finished well in time
before the reopening of the restaurant. Below are screenshots from the old and the new
versions of Cindy’s website.

61

The aim was to match the website with the new brand, making it more casual and userfriendly. Information was displayed clearly on the front page and a feed for Cindy’s
Facebook account was added. It was the desire of Joukanen and Turunen to make the
website mobile-friendly and easy to use, while at the same time communicate the new
brand. The color scheme of the site was designed to complement that of the ship and its
logo. An unfortunate aspect of the site, however, was that outdated pictures had to be
posted on it in the absence of more current ones. The rebranding process had to be
finished before new ones could be taken.

5.3 The Restaurant Manager’s Perspective on the Rebranding
The restaurant manager of Cindy, Tomi Turunen, was interviewed but a couple of days
after Cindy had opened for business, May 2nd. The purpose of the timing was for him to
have time to familiarize himself with the staff and get a feel of the renewed Cindy
before being interviewed on those topics. The interview was held in the restaurant.
Turunen began by telling that he moved to Turku to study tourism management in 2006.
While studying, he worked at a conference service provider that did, among other
things, catering. The working experience made him interested in the restaurant business,
but he decided to finish his degree before making the switch. After graduating in 2010,
he got a job at restaurant Teini in Turku. The manager at Teini, along with the rest of
the cunning staff, taught Turunen the basics of the trade. After working at several
restaurants in the city and spending one year in between as a real-estate agent,
Turunen’s road led to Cindy. He first started at Cindy in the spring of 2016.
Turunen was asked about how he perceived the old brand of Cindy. He explained that
he would have placed the restaurant in the category of Turku’s traditional restaurants.
He was aware of the ship’s focus on self-imported wine, organic and near-produced
food, and great customer service.
“A classical, traditional, stylish restaurant that leaned toward a fine-dining
theme.” (Turunen 2017)
To provide some contrast, Turunen was immediately after asked how he would describe
the desired new brand of Cindy.
“We are looking to shift to a bistro-kind of style and more relaxed customer
service.” (Turunen 2017)
With the word bistro, Turunen sought to indicate a less tense and less formal service
and a more simplistic product supply. He elaborated that this relaxation would be
visible for example in the way that customers are served, the composition of the menu,
and the attire of the staff. Turunen would point out, however, that customers would
63

Kalle Joukanen
naturally be treated with respect and politeness, but with a familiarizing touch that
would make them feel comfortable.
Regarding the roles of individuals conducting the rebranding process, Turunen said that
he and CEO Joukanen mostly drove the process. He said that a firm co-operation
between the two has been going on since the fall of 2016.
“He [CEO Joukanen] has given me very free hands in the process. I am thankful
for that and for him trusting me with it.” (Turunen 2017)
Turunen continued to explain that since the beginning of 2017, head chef Leskinen and
manager of the deck of the ship, Ruuska, have been responsible for the products of their
respective domains. Turunen had given them the freedom to make decisions, as long as
they would be in line with the new brand.
Turunen was then asked to elaborate on his role and all it had entailed. The list was
long.
“Interviewing and hiring staff, making all necessary deals with suppliers,
deciding on interiors and furniture with Joukanen, coordinating with the website
designers, menus, drinks menus, visual appearance of the ship, Facebook.”
(Turunen 2017)
He has, as previously stated, started to delegate tasks to others, but stressed the impact
of his personal vision and effort to date.
The staff of Cindy in the summer of 2017 would consist of 12 people: 5 in the bar on
deck, 4 in the kitchen, and 3 in the downstairs restaurant. Security services and weekend
entertainment would be outsourced, so they do not affect the count. The quantity of
employees would be one less than the previous year, due to the desire to ensure an
adequate amount of working hours for all. Since the restaurant often closes if the
weather is bad, work shifts might occasionally get cancelled.

64

Kalle Joukanen
The following topic was the composition of the staff and the personalities of the
employees. Turunen felt that the spectrum is rather wide.
“I feel like everyone is their own person. There are the livelier ones and the
more composed ones. There is a lot of expertise in different professional areas,
but there are also some with quite little working experience. They, on the other
hand, make up for their lack of experience with a positive and excited attitude.”
(Turunen 2017)
He pointed out that he is very happy with the staff he was able to gather, considering the
vast amount of competition currently in the city. Turunen said that around Christmastime he had realized how many new restaurants were to be opened in the city the
upcoming summer, which activated him on the hiring front. He had been able to put
together an energetic staff that would correspond well with the desired new brand.
How employees had been informed about Cindy’s desired new brand and how they had
received the knowledge was the following point of interest in the interview. Turunen
explained that he had inquired about each applicant’s perception of the old brand of
Cindy in job interviews. The perceptions of the ones that knew the restaurant aligned
pretty well with those of Turunen’s previous thoughts. They had felt Cindy was a
traditional and old-fashioned place. Some had not known that the ship had a lower level.
After establishing an idea of what the brand had been like, Turunen had given a brief
explanation of the desired new direction.
“I was not able to tell everything, but I explained our main goals. The question I
then asked was whether they would be willing to work towards this goal, that
was very important to me. Everyone said yes. Before we opened, we held
meetings where we went through everything gradually. Now they know what the
big picture is.” (Turunen 2017)
The reason behind the gradual reveal was not to overwhelm the employees with too
much information at a time. Turunen said that they have been encouraged to study the
desired new theme and to figure things out together. He feels the entire staff is aware of
the new brand and the aims for the upcoming summer.
65

Kalle Joukanen

Turunen stated that employees have been guided to act in a certain way in order to
complement the desired new brand. As discussed earlier, a relaxed, familiar,
comfortable, yet professional and respectful behavior from employees is desired.
Turunen wanted to make sure that customers feel like the staff of Cindy is reliable and
cunning, and that the personality of each individual shines through. He felt that
chemistry within the staff is good.
Regarding internal communication Turunen noted that weekly meetings have yet to be
held, since the restaurant just opened, but that they are going to become regularities.
Platforms used for daily communication are Facebook and the mobile application
WhatsApp. According to Turunen, larger updates are posted in the Facebook group,
while daily affairs are communicated through WhatsApp. There is also a weekly
calendar in the kitchen of Cindy, which works as a message board. Turunen continued
that he initiates most of the discussion in meetings and on Facebook, and that he works
as the mouthpiece of CEO Joukanen if needed. Leskinen and Ruuska inform about their
respective managerial areas. Discussion in the restaurant and in the WhatsApp
discussion, however, is free and can be initiated by anyone. CEO Joukanen does not
participate in the discussions on either media platform.
Turunen was then asked about his opinion on how the rebranding process had gone. He
felt that it had gone well. He had heard positive feedback from customers regarding
physical changes to the ship and the drinks menu. He continued, however, to say that
the upcoming weekends with DJ performances would give a better indication on the
effect of the changes.
“Based on these couple of days, the average age of our customers has dropped
significantly from what it was last year.” (Turunen 2017)
On the topic of what could have been done differently during the process, Turunen
could not identify anything significant. Some smaller things could have been done
earlier, he said, for example printing the menus and making DJ reservations in advance
further into the summer. He continued to mention the pictures on the renewed websites.
He was not content with the fact that he had had to provide the website designers with
66

Kalle Joukanen
old photos of the ship, since new ones had not yet been taken. Once they have, he will
have them put online.
The only notable thing Turunen felt was left to do was to change the canvas that is
attached to the rail that surrounds the ship. The current one, sponsored by beer
manufacturer Karhu, will be replaced with that of the new sponsor, beer manufacturer
Kronenbourg. Kronenbourg is a more youthful and vivacious brand than Karhu, making
it a better fit. Turunen blaimed Kronenbourg for the late installation of the canvas, but
did not feel the delay was a big problem.

5.4 The CEO’s Perspective on the Rebranding
The second interview with Ilkka Joukanen, CEO of Cindy, was held May 16th in
Joukanen’s office in Turku. The topic of the interview was the rebranding process and
how it turned out. Cindy had been open for business for approximately two weeks when
the interview was conducted, so Joukanen had had time to gain some insight on the
launch and first impressions of his rebranded restaurant.
Joukanen was asked to utter his feelings about the process and say whether he was
satisfied with the results. Laughing, he stated that he was satisfied with everything
except the lousy weather of early May. He felt that the process had gone well and that
everything from the bar on deck to the product supply was looking good. The feedback
he had received in the early goings had been positive.
The most significant change to the brand of Cindy was the notion of food no longer
being the main focus of the restaurant.
“In the past, we had gone “food first”, but that has now changed. Bar and
bistro, as the name states, are now the theme. Naturally we still serve food, but
we want to emphasize our great beverages and the fact that Cindy is a fine place
to come and enjoy oneself.” (Joukanen 2017b)

67

Kalle Joukanen
Joukanen felt that the ship had been made more comfortable and relaxed. On the
marketing front, the name and logo of Cindy had been altered and advertising would
focus solely on social media and Cindy’s website.
Next, Joukanen was asked if any plans had changed during the process. He could not
identify any, saying that there had not been any bigger surprises. The bad weather
during the past couple of weeks had forced him to close the bar on deck at occasions,
but that did not concern the rebranding process.
Regarding the roles of individuals participating in the process, Joukanen said he was
content. Restaurant manager Turunen had taken responsibility and delivered results. He
mentioned that the author’s help on the marketing front had been useful and that in
addition to Turunen, head chef Leskinen had performed well in the kitchen.
“Like I said in the beginning, I wanted to be the so called janitor, the one taking
care of the physical aspects, and that I have done. I gave Turunen and Leskinen
the responsibility of being in charge of the drinks and food menus, because I feel
they perform better once they have had the chance to decide.” (Joukanen 2017b)
The interview proceeded towards the theme of employees. Joukanen said he thinks the
composition of the staff is good, but how it functions remains to be seen once the
season gets going.
“They have not been tested yet.” (Joukanen 2017b)
The fact that some employees lack in experience did not concern him, as he felt their
attitude and spirit make up for the fact. He did express some concern about the kitchen
staff, which, according to him, was one employee short. With the current amount of
people working in the kitchen, things could get tough at times. He said he had already
begun searching for an addition to the team.
The following topic of discussion was the location of Cindy, the Aura River, and its
effect on the process. He felt that it had an enormous effect. He explained that
consumers have a certain perception of the riverbank and the restaurant ships and arrive
68

Kalle Joukanen
to the area with certain expectations. A ship that is open during winters and serves highquality three-course meals, in other words the old Cindy, does not meet those
expectations. Nearly all of the other ships close for winter and focus largely on drinks
on tap during the summer.
“We need to meet the demand and be “one of the ships”, but also be the best.
We need to match the perceptions of people, but also go beyond and show that
our drinks and food are the best.” (Joukanen 2017b)
Joukanen identified understanding what consumers want as one of the biggest
challenges for a restaurant by the river. Finding the balance between meeting public
demand and differentiating from competitors was a challenge.
To elaborate on the initial topic of this interview, Joukanen stated that he was very
happy about how the new brand turned out. He felt Cindy had achieved the less tense
and more inviting feel that was sought and that the products served had become as
intended. He pointed out, however, that it remains to be seen how the food menu would
work once the season gets going. Due to the bad weather, it was too soon to say.
Joukanen was asked to list some of the aspects of the old brand he wanted to maintain
after the process, if there were any.
“I definitely wanted to maintain the beautiful atmosphere of the lower level of
the ship, even though I know it could be more modern. It is so nice. I hope
people appreciate it. I also wanted to utilize the image people have in their
heads about us being a fine place to eat. Although our menu is different than
before, it still has class and quality. I want to preserve that image.” (Joukanen
2017b)
The continued emphasis on fine wines was another aspect Joukanen wanted to keep
from the old brand, as a means of differentiation.

69

Kalle Joukanen
The author was interested in if and how the process had been evaluated as it developed.
Joukanen answered that he had not conducted evaluations the way literature would
suggest, but that he had been monitoring the different activities as they took place.
“Nothing that fancy, but you obviously do it in some shape or form all the time.
Maybe not consciously, I did not do any scheduled evaluations or anything, but I
have pondered every now and then whether we are headed in the right
direction.” (Joukanen 2017b)
Challenges during the process were few, according to Joukanen. The only notable one
was finding the right staff. As stated, the kitchen staff needed an addition and some of
the waitresses were a little inexperienced. He added, that giving the kitchen staff the
freedom to express themselves and be a part of designing the menu would ease the
process. Making the physical changes to the ship, on the other hand, had been rather
effortless.
“All of the physical changes are easy. I have been doing similar things for
decades. They are really easy. The difficult part is finding the right people to
make the right products.” (Joukanen 2017b)
Joukanen could not pinpoint anything he had done differently if given the chance. He
was genuinely content with the outcome. A couple of things remained to be done,
however. The sponsor canvas Turunen had spoken about was one, while advertising
banners for the sides of the ship were another. Large banners on either side of the ship
had advertised the lower level of the restaurant last summer, but they had been
removed. Joukanen wanted to add new ones for this season and stated that together with
Turunen and the author they would decide on a promotional text for both banners.
Joukanen added that some improvements to the hull of the ship were to be made next
year.
“It is very important that the ship itself is in good shape. That is something I can
focus on next year when all of these other changes have been taken care of.”
(Joukanen 2017b)

5.5 Another Perspective on Rebranding
An interview with the CEO of another restaurant that had gone through a rebranding
process was of interest during the empiric research of this thesis. By examining how
another similar business had conducted their rebranding, additional insight into what the
case company is going through and what the process looks like would be gained. CEO
of Daily Ravintolat, Anders von Schantz agreed on being interviewed on the rebranding
of one of his restaurants. He had purchased a Spanish themed restaurant called Tomate
from Ilkka Joukanen (CEO of Cindy) in 2009 and transformed it into what is known
today as Daily Bistro. Daily Bistro is one of three restaurants von Schantz currently
runs. The interview with von Schantz was held February 27th in Daily Bistro in Turku.
The interview was rather brief due to the busy schedule of von Schantz, but he had been
sent the interview questions in advance in order for him to prepare ahead of the
discussion.
The professional career of von Schantz began with the shipping company Viking Line,
where he worked for 11 years. After Viking Line’s department in the harbor of Naantali
ceased its operations, von Schantz purchased a restaurant called Daily News in Turku
and began his career as an entrepreneur. This was 25 years ago. Eight years ago he
purchased restaurant Tomate near the bus station of Turku, which nowadays is called
Daily Bistro. Tomate had a Spanish theme and served food and beverages that fit the
brand. Lunch was served, but the main focus was on dinner guests. Von Schantz
explained that the main reason behind the purchase was the restaurant’s location near
the bus station, which he felt had potential. The renewed Daily Bistro caters to the needs
of those travelling by bus, opening early and serving lunch.
“Lunch is the main focus, we seek to have a rather simple menu. Around 80 % of
our turnover comes from food.” (von Schantz 2017)

71

Kalle Joukanen
Although von Schantz had planned on making some changes to the restaurant after
acquiring it, an unfortunate and surprising turn of events led to changes becoming more
significant.
“The biggest reason for changing the name and theme of the place was that I
made two very unsuccessful recruitments into the kitchen of Tomate. An
unfortunate association was created between the name of the restaurant and my
lousy chefs, so I wanted a clean new start.” (von Schantz 2017)
He elaborated that he usually does not change names when acquiring restaurants. In this
case, however, he felt he was forced to do so and wanted to make the best of it. Adding
the word bistro to the name to communicate the simpler, more easy-going menu was
something he wanted to do. Also, renaming the place to match one if his other
restaurants, Daily News, helped strengthen the company brand.
To continue along the topic, von Schantz was asked to talk about the changes that were
made during the rebranding.
“The things that changed at the time were the name, awnings, signs, and parts of
staff.” (von Schantz 2017)
Knowing how the restaurant looked before the process, the interviewer had the aptitude
to note that changes had happened inside, as well.
“Yes, some of the Spanish artwork has been removed. I am not sure how
important that is, but some [members of staff] feel it is…” (von Schantz 2017)
He was then asked to formulate the goals of the rebranding. He identified meeting the
demand of the new main target audience, those visiting the bus station.
“I wanted people to perceive the place as a little more relaxed and accessible,
that was the main idea. Less fine dining and more value for money. I do not
want us to be associated with fine dining at all.” (von Schantz 2017)

72

Kalle Joukanen
To elaborate upon the target audience of Daily Bistro, von Schantz stated that in
addition to the bus travelers, also people working in the area are of interest. People who
reside within a one-kilometer radius from the restaurant, for example because of work,
are a group Daily Bistro seeks to attract. Von Schantz felt Tomate sought after a wider
reach.
Marketing channels were discussed next. Von Schantz explained that the restaurant’s
marketing is quite insignificant. Daily Bistro’s website is maintained and updated every
now and then. He mentioned a campaign he had had in connection to the 25-year
anniversary of his other restaurant, Daily News, which had involved advertisements in
the windows of local taxi vehicles. The ads had mentioned all three restaurants and had,
according to von Schantz, been worth the effort. The kind of co-branding that the
campaign is an example of is applied in the visible appearance of the restaurants as
well. All three (Daily Bistro, Daily News, Surutoin) have the same look and style and
the written names share the same typeface. As the most important marketing channel,
however, von Schantz mentioned the front window of the restaurant.
“At this specific location, I would say the window is our best so called channel.
If there is something noticeable on there, several people are going to see it.”
(von Schantz 2017)
The biggest change in marketing from the times of Tomate was that von Schantz does
not advertise in newspapers.
The following questions surrounded the rebranding process, its length, and the
individuals conducting it. Von Schantz laughingly said that the process is still ongoing.
“Haha, it is still not finished. I am a little slow at times, even in situations where
I know it would be better to do things quicker and bigger. For some reason,
changes tend to be small and done one at a time, instead of making one huge
alteration.” (von Schantz 2017)
He could not remember the date or length of individual physical changes, but it would
be safe to say that the process as a whole has been going on for 8 years. The individuals
73

Kalle Joukanen
that have participated in the process are von Schantz and the staff of Daily Bistro. He
pointed out that he has tried to do as little as possible, giving employees the opportunity
to affect changes. For example, the decision to remove some of the Spanish feel was
made by the staff. They had felt it was important that the interior also communicated the
changes in theme.
Von Schantz identified the effects of a slow, gradual rebranding as the biggest challenge
in the process. A combination of having too much to do as an entrepreneur and humane
indolence were mentioned as reasons behind the slow process.
“Doing it slowly, one thing at a time and not advertising about it, leads to
knowledge sinking in slowly among consumers. I notice that some customers at
Daily News still think Daily Bistro is called Tomate.” (von Schantz 2017)
He did, however, mention a positive aspect to the slow process.
“If you make 20 changes at once, you notice effects, but you do not know what
kind of effect the individual changes had. If you make a change once per month,
you gain a better understanding of the effects. Pricing is a good example of
this.” (von Schantz 2017)
Von Schantz felt Daily Bistro has achieved most of the goals that were set when the
rebranding process began. He seemed content with the composition of the menu and the
feel of the restaurant. He also thought customers perceive the brand image as intended,
at least to his knowledge.
“It is a little hard to say since I honestly only visit Daily Bistro a couple of times
per week. But I do think things have gone as planned, to a certain extent. You
are never completely satisfied, but we have made strides in the right direction.”
(von Schantz 2017)
In the following chapter, the findings from the interviews and participant observation
will be discussed and further examined. By reflecting upon the findings from a
theoretical perspective, making relevant conclusions is enabled.

6 DISCUSSION
The purpose of this chapter is to examine the empiric findings of the previous chapter
from a theoretical standpoint. The results from each interview and the participant
observation will be analyzed and mirrored against the theoretical concepts that were
presented earlier in the thesis. The aim of doing so is to identify whether the results of
the empiric research agree or disagree with relevant literature and to draw conclusions
on the rebranding process of a hospitality industry company. The research objectives
presented in the introduction of the thesis will be kept in mind throughout the analysis.
The Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model presented by the author in figure 5
will provide the structure to this chapter. The subchapters are headlined by each of the
five steps in the model, so as to enable the presentation of relevant findings and to
provide an intuitive flow to the reading experience.

6.1 Identification of Old Brand Characteristics
The initial step of the Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model suggests that the
rebranding process begins by identifying both positive and negative characteristics of
the old brand. As Daly and Moloney (2004, p. 34-35) point out in their own model –
which the author’s model is partially derived from – this act is an internal one.
It became evident in each of the conducted interviews that management did in fact
initiate their respective rebranding processes by assessing existing brand characteristics.
Ilkka Joukanen, CEO of the case company restaurant ship Cindy, had an extremely
detailed and accurate perception of the old brand, the development of which he had
been witnessing firsthand over the span of several years. He had identified some
negative associations that were to be dismissed as a result of the rebranding process, but
also some positive ones that he sought to keep intact. Restaurant manager Turunen’s
perception of the old brand turned out to be coherent with that of Joukanen. Turunen
used adjectives like “traditional” and “old-fashioned” when describing the old brand,
which are examples of brand attributes as presented by Keller (1993, p. 4).
75

Kalle Joukanen

Anders von Schantz, CEO of Daily Bistro, had also begun the rebranding of his recently
acquired restaurant by identifying the characteristics of its brand. It became clear that
his thoughts also mainly revolved around consumer knowledge of the brand, the nature
of the local market, and the physical location of the restaurant.

6.2 Analysis of Environment and Planning
The second step of the model is another internal step that helps the company prepare for
the impending rebranding. It combines analyzing the external and internal environments
of the brand with planning the execution of the rebranding. Tevi and Otubanjo’s (2013,
p. 91) model of the rebranding process begins with a similar step. According to them,
scanning ones surroundings before proceeding is crucial to the outcome.
In the first interview Joukanen identified fierce competition and a lively waterfront
market as a couple of the characteristics of the brand’s external environment. He also
spoke about the old target demographic and how reaching the new one necessitated a
shift in marketing approach and the use of new media. Staff competence, in turn, was an
internal aspect that Joukanen wanted to improve. He followed up on some of the
external aspects in the second interview, stating that the restaurant ships of the Aura
River are a local concept that consumers perceive in a certain way. The old brand did
not fit this concept. Joukanen made it clear during the first interview that he had also
been planning some of the upcoming changes. He had a vision of the easier, more
approachable concept he wanted Cindy to have and the physical changes to the
restaurant ship that would ultimately help achieve it. He had identified the roles of the
individuals participating in the process, made decisions regarding the allocation of
funds, and set some preliminary goals for the endeavor.
Turunen had also analyzed the brand environment and arrived at similar conclusions as
Joukanen. As restaurant manager, his focus was more on the internal aspects, however.
He felt like developing trust and rapport among the staff by active communication and
arranging regular staff meetings was important. The thoughts of Harris and de

76

Kalle Joukanen
Chernatony (2001, p. 441) support this notion, as the staff often acts as the face of the
brand.
Von Schantz’ environmental analysis and planning were not as thorough as those
conducted at the case company. He did list some external aspects, such as Daily Bistro’s
favorable location near the bus station and a multitude of office buildings as well as the
lively traffic of potential customers in the vicinity, but the internal environment was not
really commented on. Planning was mostly limited to intending to switch from a dinnerfocused theme to emphasizing lunch. Very little physical changes seem to have been
planned beforehand.

6.3 Execution of Changes
Step three of the Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model is the step where
planned changes are executed and communicated to employees and external
stakeholders. The model suggests that this step involves actions that are internal to the
brand as well as external, thus involving a lot more individuals than previous stages of
the process. Changes can be of evolutionary or revolutionary nature, i.e. subtle and less
recognizable or extremely noticeable and defining (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, p. 805806).
The participant observation conducted by the author at case company Cindy was mainly
focused on this step of the process. The author played a supporting role in several
changes of the external kind – updating the name and logo of the restaurant, preparing
external communications through social media, testing items for the restaurant’s menu,
etc. Other changes that were made and lead by CEO Joukanen, which were visible to
external stakeholders, included new furniture and audio equipment, building a DJ booth
on deck, and renovating the bar.
Restaurant manager Turunen was mainly in charge of the internal employee-related
changes. He assembled and trained the staff and gradually explained the desired new
brand while being careful not to pour on too much information at once. When asked to

77

Kalle Joukanen
describe the staff, he stated that they were all different individuals with varying skills
and backgrounds and that his intention was to have all of them slowly embrace the
desired direction of the new brand. This way of doing things is well aligned with the
theory of Harris and de Chernatony (2001, p. 447-448) on how to build congruent brand
perceptions internally.
Both internal and external changes were made at Daily Bistro as well. Von Schantz
explained that they upgraded the restaurant’s façade by installing new awnings and
signs, while also changing some interior design elements inside. The Spanish-themed
decor that had fit the old brand was removed. According to von Schantz, internal
communication went both ways. In addition to him explaining his thoughts to the staff,
he listened to their opinions and let them play an integral part in the process.

6.4 Presentation of the New Brand
Once the changes have been successfully executed, the model suggests it is time to
present the new brand to all stakeholders. This is considered an external activity, as the
results of the rebranding process are made visible to all. The case company was in a
particularly favorable position to clearly separate this step from the previous one, by
being able to make all its rebranding changes while being closed for business during the
restaurant’s offseason. Most of the changes had been completed by the time Cindy
opened early in the summer, making it an opportune time to present the new brand. The
renovated bar was finished, the DJ booth on deck had been built, the new website
launched, social media accounts updated with the new logo, and so forth.
The model also seeks to illustrate that both new and old associations affect the new
brand. The old associations are the kind that have been imprinted in consumer memory
over time, as per Ghodeswar (2008, p. 6), and still linger in their minds when they are
presented with the new brand. In the second interview Joukanen identified good food,
self-imported high-quality wines, and the visually beautiful ship itself as a few of the
old associations that are still tied to the new brand of Cindy. He continued to list a

78

Kalle Joukanen
comfortable and relaxed atmosphere and a youthful social media presence as some of
the new associations tied to the new brand.
Daily Bistro was not closed during renovations in the same way Cindy was, but did still
clearly present the new brand once the name of the restaurant had been updated and the
visual appearance of the space had been renewed. Von Schantz focused on new
associations in the interview rather on old ones, mentioning the emphasis on lunch and
using the same colors and typeface in marketing aesthetics as the rest of his restaurants.
Advertising Daily Bistro together with his other restaurants would, in his words,
strengthen the brand.

6.5 Final Evaluation
The fifth and final step of the author’s Comprehensive Corporate Rebranding Model is
titled final evaluation, which implies an exhaustive examination of the rebranding
process and its results. In addition to a final evaluation, the model suggests that staged,
less extensive, evaluation should be done throughout the rebranding process. Evaluation
is done internally by management and is thus considered an internal act.
The second interview with Joukanen was conducted after Cindy had opened for
business, i.e. after the new brand had been presented, which enabled him to evaluate the
whole process. Based on his own observations and customer response, he said he was
content with the rebranding. There had been a clear shift from the old dinner-focused
theme to a more relaxed atmosphere and customers had given positive feedback.
Restaurant manager Turunen had noted that the demographic had gotten younger.
Joukanen looked back at the process and said there had not been any large problems at
any stage and that everything had gone smoothly as a whole.
Joukanen stated in the first interview that he in fact did continuously evaluate their
progress throughout the rebranding process. Although informal and unstructured, these
evaluations would at times lead to adjustments and small changes to what was being

79

Kalle Joukanen
done. The findings from the participant observation confirmed that management would
not hesitate to adapt and make changes if something was found not to be working.
Von Schantz was also able to produce some final thoughts on the rebranding process of
his restaurant, while explaining that some level of rebranding was still going on. He
almost felt like it was an everlasting process. Being content with the menu and
appearance of the restaurant and having received positive customer response, however,
were some of the final evaluations he was able to make.
The intent of the following chapter is to provide concluding remarks based on the
discussion above. The author seeks to answer the research questions posed in the
beginning of the thesis and to produce managerial implications for companies in the
hospitality industry.

7 CONCLUSIONS
This chapter is dedicated to making final conclusions based on the objective discussion
above. An assessment of whether the findings from the empiric research agree or
disagree with relevant theoretical concepts, notably the author’s Comprehensive
Corporate Rebranding Model (figure 5), is made in the following paragraphs.
Based on the initial interviews with the management of both studied companies, both
were acutely aware of the associations tied to their old brands. They had successfully
identified the negative associations that ultimately had lead to the decision to initiate a
rebranding process, but also positive ones they wanted to hold onto. Both managed to
determine some personality attributes and benefits, as introduced by Keller (1993, p. 4)
that had shaped the old brand image. Each CEO exhibited understanding that rebranding
would, as discussed in the theoretical overview, nullify some, if not most, of the brand
value tied to the old brand.
The findings show that the companies emphasized analyzing their external environment
rather than the internal one, although both were examined when plans for the rebranding
process were made. The nature of the local setting had a massive effect on the decisionmaking, especially the waterfront location of case company Cindy. CEO Joukanen
exhibited profound knowledge of the rivalry between hospitality industry actors in the
area and how local consumers perceived the riverbank of the Aura River. The demands
set by the overall image of the riverbank, and the fact that the old brand of Cindy did
not fit said image, were some of the main catalysts behind the rebranding process and
shaped it as it progressed. Von Schantz, CEO of Daily Bistro, also made it clear that the
surroundings of his restaurant, including the bus station and several office buildings,
had affected his decisions regarding the new brand. Both restaurants aimed to adapt to
their respective local environments.
The rebranding process of both restaurants advanced from analyzing and planning to
executing changes, like the author’s model suggests. The case company made use of the
time Cindy was closed to e.g. physically renovate the ship, update their website, and
hire and train new staff. Internal discussion and regular meetings were tools that were

81

Kalle Joukanen
used in order to create coherent perceptions of the new brand internally among the
employees, while entering new marketing channels and upgrading the appearance of the
ship were some of the ways in which changes were externally communicated. Daily
Bistro adopted active two-way communication as a means of rebranding internally,
while also making changes to the exterior of the restaurant. These findings allow for the
statement to be made that the third step of the model – execution of changes – indeed is
a combination of internal and external activities.
The rebranding processes of each restaurant continued to follow the steps of the
author’s model as both new brands were presented once the majority of changes were
complete. Based on customer feedback and observations made by the staff, both
restaurants had been able to form awareness of the new brand among customers.
Successful changes to marketing aesthetics and appearance of the restaurant, a supply of
hospitality services more suitable to the local demand, and coherent internal brand
perceptions can be seen as the main drivers of achieving this goal.
It was found that evaluation of the rebranding was done both during and after the
process, highlighting the former. Both CEOs stated, that some level of constant
evaluation and willingness to adapt was maintained throughout the process. Joukanen
was able to produce some final comments, however, while von Schantz felt like his
restaurant’s rebranding process was, at least to some extent, still going on.
The findings from the empiric research of this study were ultimately found to support
the author’s five-step rebranding model of a hospitality industry SME, making it a
viable tool for other similar companies to use. Management is urged to emphasize the
internal parts of the process, since having a profound understanding of the old brand and
the nature of the brand’s environment has been found to be a prerequisite for a
successful rebranding. Although executing a rebranding process of a hospitality industry
SME relies on the efforts of several individuals, the decision-making and leadership of
management is crucial. Furthermore, this study proves that establishing clear-cut roles
for the individuals participating in the process has a positive impact on the outcome.
The importance of coherent brand perceptions among employees does not go unnoticed
in the rebranding process of a hospitality industry SME. As members of staff
82

Kalle Joukanen
communicate the brand when interacting with customers, it is imperative to make sure
their perception of the brand is aligned. Management should employ active internal
communication, regular interaction, and a staged explanation of the desired new brand
to employees in order to help achieve successful rebranding.

8 SWEDISH SUMMARY
Rebrandingprocessen av ett litet eller medelstort företag i hotell- och
restaurangbranschen i en lokal omgivning: Case restaurang Cindy
Restaurangbåt Cindy i Aura Å i Åbo hade bestämt sig för att ingå en rebrandingprocess
för att uppdatera dess gammalmodiga känsla till ett mer ungdomligt och fräscht bistroaktigt tema. I och med att så gott som alla företag utför någon form av rebranding under
sin verksamhetstid (Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, s. 805-806), visade sig detta vara en
intressant utgångspunkt för en casestudie. Dessutom påverkas helheten av den unika
miljön restaurangbåt Cindy befinner sig i, nämligen Aura Å.
Avsikten med denna avhandling är att skapa en förståelse av företagsbranding och
rebranding, samt undersöka hur små och medelstora företag i hotell- och
restaurangbranschen framgångsrikt kan rebranda sig och hur den lokala omgivningen
påverkar processen. Avhandlingen består av en teoretisk översikt samt en empirisk
undersökning. I brist av tillräckliga svenska översättningar, kommer uttrycken branding
och rebranding användas i denna svenska sammanfattning. Branding kan fritt översatt
uppfattas som varumärkesuppbyggnad eller varumärkesutveckling, medan rebranding
innebär förändringen eller uppdateringen av ett varumärke.
För att kunna förstå rebranding – huvudtemat av denna avhandling – behövs en
grundläggande uppfattning om vad företagsbranding innebär. Det första teorikapitlets
ändamål är att introducera läsaren till ämnet.
Konsumenter bildar sällan förhållanden med tjänster eller fysiska produkter. Istället
bildar de förhållanden med varumärken (Davis 2000, s. 4). En stark
varumärkesidentitet, som enligt Harris och de Chernatony (2001, s. 442) består av sex
komponenter, är ett differentieringsverktyg som skapar förtroende hos konsumenter och
kan visa sig vara en konkurrensfördel. En ytterligare fördel kan skapas när ett
familjeföretag utnyttjar sina unika egenskaper i sin varumärkesidentitet.

84

Kalle Joukanen
Personal spelar en viktig roll i den interna brandingen hos ett företag. Harris och de
Chernatony (2001, s. 447-448) förklarar att personalen måste ha en överensstämmande
uppfattning om varumärket för att nå önskade resultat. Detta åstadkoms genom att
samla ihop en heterogen grupp individer som sedan bildar homogena uppfattningar
genom samarbete och regelbunden kommunikation.
Varumärkeskunskap består av två huvudsakliga koncept: varumärkesmedvetenhet och
varumärkesbild. Varumärkesmedvetenhet är ett slags mått över hur väl konsumenter
känner till varumärket. Begreppet varumärkesbild, i sin tur, innebär allt konsumenter
associerar med varumärket samt känslorna de upplever gentemot varumärket. (Keller
1993, s. 3-4.)
Företaget som undersöks i den empiriska delen av avhandlingen är en restaurangbåt i
Aura å i Åbo. Ån klassificeras som en urban sjösida, vars unika egenskaper för med sig
bl.a. logistiska för- och nackdelar. De naturliga elementen som omringar restaurangen
skapar vissa associationer hos konsumenter och påverkar deras upplevelser (Sairinen
and Kumpulainen 2005, s. 132).
Rebranding behandlas i det andra teorikapitlet. Kapitlet och den nya
rebrandingmodellen som presenteras i dess slut fungerar som underlag för den
empiriska undersökningen som följer.
Enligt Muzellec och Lambkin (2006, s. 805) betyder rebranding att man ompositionerar
ett existerande varumärke bland intressenter genom skapandet av t.ex. ett nytt namn, en
ny symbol, en ny design, eller en kombination av dessa. Rebranding kan uträttas på
olika hierarkiska nivåer inom en organisation och kan innebära drastiska förändringar
och/eller mindre synliga förändringar.
Orsaker till rebranding kan antingen vara interna eller externa. Förändringar inom
företagets ägarstruktur och förändringar i företagets strategi är interna orsaker, medan
förändringar i företagets position och förändringar i företagets omgivning är externa.
(Muzellec & Lambkin 2006, s. 810.)

85

Kalle Joukanen
Tevi och Otubanjos (2013, s. 91) modell jämför rebrandingprocessen med
evolutionsteorin. Modellen består av fem steg: undersökning av varumärkets
omgivning, självutvärdering, ompositionering, presentering av varumärkets nya
identitet, samt utveckling av den nya identiteten. Ur modellen framgår att
rebrandingprocessen är en långvarig helhet som kräver anpassning och responsivitet.
Daly och Moloneys (2004, p. 35) modell består i sin tur av tre faser. Den första fasen
innebär analysering av både interna och externa faktorer som påverkar varumärket. I
den andra fasen fattas beslut som sedan kommuniceras åt varumärkets intressenter. Den
sista fasen är utvärdering.
På basis av dessa modeller har skribenten bildat en egen rebrandingmodell (figur 5) som
kommer fungera som utgångspunkt då resultaten från den empiriska undersökningen
analyseras. Modellen består av fem steg, varav en del är interna och en del är externa. I
steg ett identifieras det gamla varumärkets positiva och negativa egenskaper. I steg två
analyseras varumärkets interna och externa omgivning samt kommande förändringar
planeras. Förändringarna utförs och kommuniceras åt interna och externa intressenter i
steg tre. Steg fyra är presentationen av det nya varumärket. Det sista steget är
utvärdering av processen.
En kombination av kvalitativa metoder valdes för avhandlingens empiriska
undersökning. Observering av rebrandingprocessen hos företaget i fråga samt
kvalitativa intervjuer utfördes för att samla relevant och valid data. Dessa ostrukturerade
och responsiva metoder ansågs vara mer ändamålsenliga för den ifrågavarande
undersökningen än kvantitativa metoder, eftersom skribenten var intresserad av
bakomliggande motiveringar, personliga värden, och känslor. Skribenten intervjuade
restaurangbåt Cindys verkställande direktör (VD) Ilkka Joukanen (två gånger),
restaurangbåt Cindys restaurangchef Tomi Turunen, samt Daily Ravintolats VD Anders
von Schantz.
I kapitel nummer fem presenteras resultaten från den empiriska undersökningen.
Intervjuerna och observationsresultaten presenteras utförligt i kronologisk ordning.
Teman som diskuterades i intervjuerna var orsaker till rebrandingen av respektive
restaurang, vilka förändringar som gjordes, vilka roller deltagande individer hade i
processen, samt hur processen utvärderades. I observeringskapitlet presenteras bl.a.
86

Kalle Joukanen
förändringarna i restaurangbåt Cindys logo och webbplats samt bilder före och efter de
fysiska renoveringarna ombord. Skribentens insats, vilken innebar beslut gällande
menyer och hjälp med marknadsföring, tydliggörs också i kapitlet.
Efter att undersökningens resultat presenterats, diskuteras de ur en teoretisk synpunkt.
Den omfattande litteraturöversikten och skribentens rebrandingmodell utnyttjas för att
producera relevanta slutsatser, vilka formulerats i avhandlingens sista kapitel.
Det visade sig att rebrandingprocessen hos bägge företag som undersöktes, d.v.s.
restaurangbåt Cindy och restaurang Daily Bistro, började i enlighet med skribentens
modell, nämligen genom identifiering av det gamla varumärkets egenskaper.
Företagsledningen lyckades i båda fallen kartlägga negativa egenskaper som de ville bli
av med och som orsakat själva rebrandingen, men även positiva sådana som skulle bli
kvar. Det nästa steget var att analysera omgivningen hos respektive restaurang och
planera de kommande förändringarna som rebrandingprocessen skulle innebära. Cindys
företagsledning, d.v.s. VD Joukanen och restaurangchef Turunen, hade en klar
uppfattning om både den externa och den interna miljön av restaurangen. Externt satte
åstrandsmiljön och den sammanlagda effekten av alla aktörer runtomkring stranden
vissa krav på verksamheten, medan internt behövdes aktiv kommunikation och
sammanhörighet för att nå önskade resultat. Von Schantz konstaterade i sin tur att det
nuvarande temat på hans restaurang inte passade omgivningen, utan krävde ett mer
lunch-betonat utbud. Hos bägge restaurang kartlades kommande förändringar i samband
med omgivningsanalysen.
Respektive rebrandingprocess gick vidare enligt skribentens modell. I den tredje fasen
utförde restaurangerna förändringarna som hade planerats – både interna och externa
sådana. Hos caseföretaget innebar förändringarna bl.a. renovering av baren, uppdatering
av restaurangens logo, namn, och webbplats, ny möblering, samt integrering av de
anställdas uppfattning om det nya brandet. Daily Bistro fick också nytt namn, förnyade
markiser och möbler, justerade menyn, osv.
Det fjärde steget i modellen menar att det nya brandet presenteras åt alla dess
intressenter efter att förändringarna utförts. Detta nya brand speglar både nya
associationer som uppstått och vissa gamla som blivit kvar oavsett processen. Gällande
87

Kalle Joukanen
Cindy, inträffade detta då restaurangen öppnade igen sent på våren 2017 efter att ha
varit stängd hela vintern. VD Joukanen menade i den andra interviewn som hölls efter
öppningen att förändringarna varit lyckade och att han fått positiv kundrespons.
Skribentens modell antyder att rebrandingprocessen utvärderas av företagsledningen
både medan den pågår samt slutligen efter att allt är klart. Von Schantz ansåg att hans
rebrandingprocess ännu var, till viss grad, pågående, så hans slutliga utvärdering skulle
göras senare, men Joukanen bekräftade skribentens antaganden.
Det kan alltså konstateras att skribentens rebrandingmodell beskriver
rebrandingprocessen hos små och medelstora företag i hotell- och restaurangbranschen
och att den således kan användas som hjälpmedel för sådana företag. Modellen visar att
processen innebär både interna och externa skeden, men att betoningen ligger hos det
interna beslutsfattandet och analyserandet. Förutom det, är det enormt viktigt att de
anställda hos företaget kommunicerar regelbundet och bildar sammanhängande
uppfattningar om brandet och dess önskade riktning.
