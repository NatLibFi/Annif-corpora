ABSTRACT
This study examines the historical background of manipulated education in Turkey,
the latest educational reforms by the AKP government, and how these reforms lead to
polarization.
Turkey is an ethnically mixed and diverse country related to its geographical location
in the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia, as well as the heritage of the multinational
Ottoman Empire. In the meantime, most of the Turkish governments preferred to use the
"nation-building" strategy according to their preference and educational policies have been
an essential part of nation-building. While Ataturk's educational policies included the aims
of Westernization and secularization, Erdogan's educational policies aim to Islamization of
Turkey. In this matter, Erdogan's political ideas and politics of political Islam contradict
the ideas of Ataturk's secularism, which creates disputes and misconceptions between
Kemalists (Ataturk's supporters) and conservative nationalists (Erdogan's supporters).
In today’s Turkey, educational reforms by the AKP government are therefore
increasing polarization due to the fact that education is used as a basis for revenge by the
Islamists vis-à-vis previous secular governments. The restructuring of education aimed to
remove secularism from schools and to create a new identity against secular identity. As a
result, latest educational policies serve a widespread of Erdoganism which has triggered
polarization in Turkey The thesis aims to determine how polarization started and
developed in Turkey under Erdogan’s rule, and how the use of education as a political tool
by AKP has caused polarization in Turkey.
Keywords: polarization, Turkey, education, Erdogan, reforms, identity building,
ideological tendencies

1 Introduction
This thesis addresses social polarization in light of education reforms in Turkey, an
ethnically mixed secular state. It is geographically located in the Middle East, Europe, and
Central Asia with a distinct heritage of the historic multinational Ottoman Empire. A
turning point in modern Turkey’s history was the founding of the Justice and Development
Party (AKP) 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Erdogan’s way of governing the country is likely to be a new official ideology for
Turkey, as Akyol says that Kemalism has existed for almost a century. Kemalism is the
political, economic, and social principles advocated by Turkish general and statesman
Kemal Atatürk and designed to create a modern republican secular Turkish state out of a
portion of the Ottoman empire. The Kemalist elite saw the achievement of the
revolutionary aim of modernization and became part of the Western, 'civilized' world by
secularizing the political system and excluding religion from the public sphere. In a new
Turkey, however, the idea of modern, secular, and national youth is replaced by
Erdoganism through education.
Erdoganism has been crystallized in the past three years, making Erdogan the most
powerful Turk since Atatürk. Akyol (2016) compares Erdoganism with other populist
authoritarianism, such as Peronism in Argentina, Chavism in Venezuela, and Putinism in
Russia. Erdoganism has already turned Turkey into illiberal democracy where liberal
values weakened despite free elections. (Akyol,2016)
The AKP’s government’s neoliberal economic and conservative social policies cause
concern in Turkey. Some researchers claim that the AKP's policy aims to control the future
by reshaping the young. Nevertheless, education is the area where high expectations and
concerns are common in Turkish society, given that it is adversely affected by the AKP's
policies. Therefore, analyzing the last educational reforms is essential for understanding
social polarization in Turkey. Education needs a social consensus. It is important to give
social consensus on educational issues such as the purpose and content of the education
and how resources should be distributed. It is also important that this understanding is
participatory, inclusive, and rights-based. Exclusive content and unfair distribution of
resources in education, however, aggravate social polarization in Turkey. This thesis

8

argues that AKP's educational reforms (from 2011 to present) increase “othering” and
social distances among people.
This thesis primarily focuses on the third term of the AKP government (2011-present)
because gradual Islamisation of curriculum has dramatically been intensified in this period.
In addition, Erdogan’s “One man State” has also come true in this stage after the 2017
referendum that is why the third term can also be called the period of “a new Turkey”. The
signs of Erdoganism, such as manipulated education, efforts for the elimination of secular
identity, and creation of pious generation can be detected in education reforms. According
to Lukuslu (2016), The Ministry of National Education (MONE)1 is a key institution to
impact on Turkey's national identity and pass on a new identity to the youth. (Lukuslu,
643)
In order to understand Erdoganism and its impact on education, it is important to
review previous events before the foundation of the AKP government. It is not the first
time the dominant party has manipulated education. It also has been used for the
implementation of different political purposes by the different governments in Turkey.

1.1 Aim and research question

The primary aim of this thesis is to examine educational reforms introduced by the AKP
government as a way of promoting Erdoganism. The central research question for this
thesis is: How has education been restructured to include Erdogan’s ideology into Turkish
education system? The focus will be on educational reforms introduced by the AKP
government and will be analyzed in a historical and political framework. Education is
chosen as the context of the study because educational reforms are one of the main reasons
for the intensifying social polarization in Turkey.
Education system in Turkey is identified as an instrument for implementing
Erdoganism. Turkey has the most highly centralized educational system of any OECD

1

The Ministry of National Education in Turkey oversees one of the largest education systems in Europe. Administrative
regulations and supervision of formal and non-formal education (except higher education) are implemented by the
Ministry of Education, see http://stem-pd-net.eu/en/mone/.

member state. Aksit shows that the MONE mainly regulates schools. The ministry makes
all political decisions, organizes all aspects of the formal curriculum, and reviews all
implementations through the provincial offices (N. Aksit , 2007 p.135). Further, the
education system is seen as a tool for raising nationalist and pious youth. Therefore, to
review some major challenges before the AKP government will be crucial to understand
today’s situation. Educational reforms introduced by the AKP government, such as the
4+4+4 reform as well as the Islamization of curriculum has strengthened the conception of
“us and them” in Turkey.
Moreover, Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution and how AKP interprets this
article in its policy will be discussed. Even though Article 24 states that apart from
mandatory religion classes, other religion classes are subject to people's own choices, and
religious classes of minorities have to be organized according to their legal representatives.
However, there are mandatory Sunni classes and extra-curricula activities for Alevis. Thus,
this educational policy is a way of imposing Sunni faith on Alevis.

1.2 Research Methodology and Material

In this research, a descriptive method, which is one of the qualitative research methods will
be used to investigate the effects of Erdogan's ideology and identity on Turkish education
policy, which is one of the most essential parts of public policy. “Descriptive method is a
scientific research method describing available situations and cases without considering
relations between variables” (Ayan and Tütüncü,2016).
Descriptive research involves gathering data that describe events and then organizes,
and describes the data collection (Glass & Hopkins, 1984). It often uses visuals to help the
reader for the understanding of the data distribution. (AECT 2011) For example, in this
thesis, the table of Religion Courses was prepared to understand the historical development
of religion courses and how the situation is at present. Descriptive studies target at
discovering

"what is," while analytical research tries to determine why this is so or how it

became (Wiley and Sons, 2004; AECT 2011). It should also be stated that descriptive
studies have an important role in educational research. They have significantly increased
our knowledge of what is happening in schools (AECT 2011).

Initially, I defined the central concepts by reading some research about dimensions of
polarization in Turkey that were conduced by Bilge University and KONDA. Those
research were the initial step to understand which factors lead to increasing polarization.
Following this, I checked education reports by the OECD and Egitim-Sen
(Education and Science Workers' Union Turkey) to get outlooks of education policies in
Turkey.
In the next step, I formulated the topic through connecting educational policies by the
AKP government and social polarization in Turkey. Therefore after formulating the topic
I began to collect materials.
Educational reforms between 2012 and 2020, which form the basis of this research,
have been downloaded from http://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/page/about.
TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM (Turkish Academic Network and Information Center)
provides “online hosting services and an editorial workflow management system for
academic journals” published in Turkey via the DergiPark platform. Another important
data source of the research is the Turkish constitution and the English version of the
Constitution is available in the official website of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
(TBMM)
Likewise, books and articles about the root and nature of Erdogan's policies, Erdogan's
new identity building through education, the root of polarization in Turkey, etc. were
downloaded

from

https://abo.finna.fi/?lng=en-gb,

https://scholar.google.com,

and

https://www.academia.edu.
Furthermore, I used textbooks of 7th grade and 8th grade to get a brief overview of the
underlying problems in education before the AKP government. Examples from the
mentioned textbooks were obtained from the books of Füsun Üstel and Gürkaynak.
I focused on an analysis of the nation will discourse of Erdogan. I watched Erdogan's
speech, which he used at the AKP’s meetings. Videos of the AKP’s meetings are available
on this YouTube channel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gei3mbMcIM.
Lastly, I also used pro-Kemalist, Erdoganist, and Gulenist media and publications as
a source in order to be critical.
For example, reports by the Hizmet Studies were carried out by the Center for
Hizmet Studies that highlights events related to the Gulenist movement. One of the most
popular daily newspapers; Hürriyet and Milliyet, state-run news agency; Anadolu News,
etc.
11

I used sources in English and Turkish, and provided translations of the Turkish
materials for this thesis.
1.3 Previous research

In a modern world, it is not uncommon to come across various groups that
have distinct cultural values, attitudes, traditions, ways of living within one society. In
case those values become contradictions with one another, acceptability of the difference
decreases for those groups. Social polarization is one of the most harmful impacts of such
a situation (Ağırdır, 2008).
According to Rubin & Pruitt (1994), who names the situation as Community
Polarization, once a conflict arises as the result of such segregation and becomes hard to
handle, different individuals are obliged to make choices regarding which group to support.
This phenomenon is one of the main elements in the process of rising conflict. Additionally,
the absence of an impartial side worsens tension since there is not any side left that would
contribute to mitigating the conflict with an unbiased attitude (Rubin et al., 1994).
Increasing polarization has a dramatic impact on societies. As Tom Atlee states in
Exploring the Dynamics of Polarization

(2004), polarization tricks us into dehumanizing

the other side - ignoring their uniqueness, their diversity, their humanity, their resources,
their potential fellowship toward shared goals (2004). In this sense, polarization
strengthens bias and conception of “Us & Them”. Moreover, it only respects one's values
and increases intolerance in society.
“Polarization is the increasing concentration of groups, forces or interests around two
conflicting or contrasting positions" - Us and Them, the right way and the wrong way,
Tom Atlee states. Polarization, therefore, is based on the division into groups and
contradicted views. He adds that the conception of "Left vs. Right” is a good example to
describe political polarization. These terms are designed to organize forces for political war
more than for greater human understanding, Atlee (2004)argues. These terms are shown as
examples of how specific notions target to cause political war, and it is no coincidence that
politicians generally use terms of "us and them", "right and left" in the political wars to
polarize countries.

12

Polarization in Turkey has a long-lasting history. Signs of polarization are back to the
period of the Ottoman Empire, but as Kiris states, competition between the Republican
People's Party (CHP) and Democratic Party (DP) can be considered as the beginning of
polarization. While the mainstream polarization in Turkish politics, the CHP-DP
opposition, is generally defined as the center-periphery opposition, has gained a new
dynamic since the 1960s with the establishment of the right and left concepts. Starting
from the 1970s, the emergence of new political currents and more extreme views in the
political arena apart from these two main currents have been the factors to increase the
polarization (Kiris, 2011, p.33).
Polarization between political parties intensifies social distance between supporters
of political parties. The concept of polarization has different definitions, and some claim
that it is only at the elite level; the population is not so polarized. Others say that distance
only increases between the right-left or liberal-conservative axis. People can support
different parties, however this does not require a person to be an enemy. Nevertheless
polarization is such the fact that party preferences are transformed into identities; a person
begins to see himself in a group with those who choose the same party (Semerci, 2019)
Kiris shows that this type of identity-based and values-based polarization gained
prominence in the Turkish party system. 1991, 1995 and 1999 general elections held
during this period were influential in the direction of polarized pluralism. The religious and
the secular, the center, and the periphery, the left- the right, Alevi-Sunni, Kurdish-Turkish
are the main sides of polarization in Turkey (Kiris, 2011, p.33).
Increasing identity-based polarization is also related to the strengthening of
“re-identification" or “identification of differences” after 1980 related to some important
political events, and it influenced Turkey, as well. Unal points out that the considerable
period of change began not only in Turkey but also in the world during the 1980s. The
most significant change brought about by the political, economic, and cultural
developments in the world was the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, following the fall
of the Berlin Wall in the late 1980s (Unal, 2013 pp.1-3). Some scholars call this process a
“re-identity” or “identification of differences” in terms of the revival of ethnic, religious
and cultural identities, or the period of identity rise. Therefore, the identification of
differences got power and was one of the essential political tools in a multi-party system.

13

Correspondingly, once different political parties used this situation, it also has led to
polarization in Turkey.
Thus, tension among these parts has always been a key factor in Turkish politics.
Lack of intraparty democracy and some elections like and the referendum had led to
continued social polarization by Turkish political organizations. Populist politicians from
the left and the right have used polarization as a political tool rather than phenomena that
need to be solved, and in turn, this systematically triggers the fear and hate toward the
other (Mustafa Erdogan, 2018).
In today’s Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is identified as a populist politician, some
scholars argue. According to scholars, there are three main phases of the AKP government
that are being lead by Erdogan.
At the beginning of the AKP governance, a peace dialogue with the Kurdish
movement started, which was an important event in the history of Turkey, and reforms
packages for freedom of expression and cultural rights were accepted. In addition, Turkey
developed relations with neighboring countries and achieved significant economic growth.
Therefore, AKP took an important step for the democratization process, and that is why the
first term of the AKP called the “golden era” (Zavaglia, 2016).
The second term of the AKP (2007-2011) was featured as a beginning of the
“de-democratization” period. In 2010, several government amendments to the 1982
Turkish Constitution. Since then, as Zavaglia defines, a “shift toward authoritarian
maneuvers” has begun with a dramatic increase in political imprisonment and restrictions
on freedom of speech and freedom of the press (Zavaglia, 2016).
The third phase of the AKP government (2011-present) is incompatible with the
previous reform period. Therefore, the process of democratization has come to a complete
halt and the government has moved to a hybrid regime. Zavaglia defines the hybrid
governance as “a regime no longer considered in a state of transition toward democracy,
but rather finding itself trapped halfway in between authoritarianism and democracy.”
After gaining the center of the political situation, the AKP finally managed to monopolize
power by removing its opponents. The protection of civil liberties and the increasing

14

restriction of fundamental human freedoms have been a serious phenomenon (Zavaglia,
2016).
Today, Erdoganism is also a crucial feature of Turkey’s important public policies,
including education policies. Yilmaz and Bashirov (2018) characterize Erdoganism as a
political

regime

which

“electoral

authoritarianism

as

an

electoral

system,

neopatrimonialism as an economic system, populism as a political strategy, and Islamism
as a political ideology.” The regime divided society into ‘us’ and ‘them’ and managing
through polarizing. In this division, Erdogan introduces himself as the representative of the
nation will.The regime divided the society into ‘us’ and ‘them’ according to the distinction
between its conservative and nationalist allies and secular, leftist, Alevi, non-Muslim and
Gulenist critics ( pp.1821).
Supporters of his national will are, therefore “us” or “people”, and who are against
his will, they are enemies of the state, in other words, they are “them” or “non-people.”
Non-people’s intention is to divide the country. The notion of danger and the construction
of an enemy have always been used by the states to justify their disciplining and
controlling techniques as well as legitimizing their use of violence. The focus on
securitization in terms of the exercise of the state surveillance provides the classification
and categorization of the individuals around the criteria of “criminality/causing danger.”
Therefore, when opponents of the current government are being arrested, this action is
declared as a protection of Turkey’s security and prevention of further risks against the
government. ( Yilmaz and Bashirov,2018 pp.1821).
Kazim Ates (2017) also states that The AKP inherited religious-conservative
populism, which is embedded in the political culture of the Turkish Right. He adds that the
AKP governments framed all social demands and political problems in an Islamist
discursive formation and re-interpreted them through the Islamic prism. As part of this, the
education system was reorganized by opening new Imam-Hatip schools, adding new
“compulsory elective” religion courses to the curriculum, and mandatory courses in
religious culture and ethics.
However, education is in itself a human right and a necessary means of realizing
others rights. As a right to empowerment, education is an essential tool for economically
and socially excluded adults and children to save themselves from poverty. Education has
15

an important role in supporting women, protecting children from exploitation and
dangerous labor, and sexual exploitation, promoting human rights and democracy.
Increasingly, education is being recognized as one of the best financial investments that
states can make. Importantly, education is one of the best financial investments states can
make. “But the importance of education is not just practice; a well-educated, enlightened
and active mind able to wander freely and widely, is one of the joys and rewards of human
existence” (CESCR General Comment No. 13: The Right to Education, 1999).
On the contrary, The AKP’s reforms have widely expanded the religious content of
the curriculum only on the basis of Sunni faith. Cornell shows that Turkey is in direct
breach of a 2007 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, which held that Turkey’s
compulsory religious education classes violated minorities rights because classes are
organized solely based on Sunni Islam. The government renamed the class to “Religious
Culture and Moral Values” in order to expand its scope, but in practice, this regulation was
not applied. (Cornell, 2005)
To conclude, education is one of the most important factors influencing the future of
individuals and societies. The strategic importance of education is clearer in the age of
globalization. Turkey's future depends on how well it can integrate into the world economy
and transform itself into the information society. A high-quality education system is
needed for development, industrialization, democratization, and security today and in the
future (Guven, 2007, p.376).

2 JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AKP)

The chapter aims to explore the background of AKP and its becoming dominant

political

power in the country. By the year 2001, Turkey experienced one of the worst financial
crises in its history, followed by public frustration with the Kemalist army that had a
significant impact on the public. These conditions lead to the rise of the Justice and
Development Party in national politics. In the election campaigns, Erdogan and the AKP's
platform abandoned National Outlook's agenda and announced their "conservative" and
democratic" agenda.

A year later, the AKP won the election and came to power (Ozeren

et al., 2020).

2.1 The rise of Erdogan

Back to the root of “conservative and democratic agenda”, Recep Tayyip Erdogan first was
a candidate for Istanbul from the Welfare Party2, and he was not elected in 1986
parliamentary elections. Then, Erdogan was a candidate for Mayor of Beyoglu in the local
elections held on March 26, 1989, he failed once again and could not be elected. After two
years, Erdogan entered the general elections on October 20, 1991, as the main candidate of
the Welfare Party in the 6th district of Istanbul.(Shadi Hamdi, 2004, pp. 3-4)..
Later, on January 15, 1994, party president Necmettin Erbakan announced that
Erdogan would be a candidate for Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, and Erdogan won
the election. However, Virtue Party (Fazilet Partisi, FP) was also sealed like the Welfare
Party that was the previous party of Erbakan, and following this, the national vision
movement was divided into "traditionalists" and "innovators"(Shadi Hamdi,2004, pp. 3-4).
The notion of Political Islam begins from Necmeddin Erkabakan period that has a
great influence on not only today’s Turkey policy but also on the policies of other Muslim
majority countries. According to Shadi Hamdi, “Erdogan was appointed deputy prime
2

Welfare Party, or Refah Partisi, is a Turkish political party known for its Islamic orientation. It was founded in 1983 by
Necmettin Erbakan and became the first religious party in Turkey to win a general election in 1995. “The party’s
pro-Islamist policies brought it into conflict with the army and other secular elements in the country, and it left power in
1997. It was subsequently banned.” Source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Welfare-Party
17

minister, making him one of the first Islamists in the world to exercise the responsibilities
of government”(Shadi Hamdi, 2004, p.1). Thus, Erdogan was selected as a man who
considered preserving the policy of Erbakan.
Nowadays, there are a lot of familiar aspects of Erbakan and Erdogan’ policy. Like
Erdogan, running the government with own ideology was also more critical for Erbakan’s
internal and foreign policy than the development of the government. For example, Erbakan
was also against the political relationship of Turkey with Israel and tried to make allies
with Arabian and Muslim counties. This foreign policy shows how Turkish foreign policy
changed during Erbakan prime ministering and how Erdogan proceeded most of his policy
nowadays. In addition, Erbakan also tried to raise political Islam in Turkey, however the
military did not support him, and this is one of the main differences between Erdogan and
Erbakan. Erdogan gained the trust of the military or changed the structure of the military in
contrast to his ideological father. That is why Erbakan failed to redesign the political
situation in Turkey, but Erdogan achieved. As a result, even though Erbakan could not
restructure the state, Erdogan did.
Nevertheless, political connections between Erbakan and Erdogan were ended when
traditionalists established the Felicity Party (Saadet Partisi, SP) and the innovators
established the Justice and Development Party. As mentioned above, even though the signs
of Erbakan’s ideology have considerably seen in most of Erdogan’s reforms and projects,
Erdogan always argued that they have own way with the AKP, and they are not a part of
any previous movements and ideology anymore.
Hence, it is necessary to differentiate the concept of Islam and Islamism from each
other. Because, according to many scholars, religious movements in Turkey are related to
the rise of Islamism rather than Islam. There is a big difference between Islam and
Islamism; Kahraman (2002) defines Islam as an epistemology and Islamism as a paradigm.
So, there is an epistemology paradigm tension, and many of conflicts based on this tension
in Turkey. According to him, Islam brought an alternative to the world-universe perception
and was born as an epistemology. Later, it became an ideology by integrating with political
power and introducing various limitations. This approach has limited its meaning, it has
become conservative, prevented Islam from appealing to a broad audience, and Islam
converted into paradigm (Kahraman, 2002, pp. 9-11). Yilmaz and Bashirov (2018) define
18

Islamism as “a form of instrumentalization of Islam by individuals, groups, and
organizations that pursue political objectives. They argue that Islamism “provides political
responses to today’s societal challenges by imagining a future, the foundations for which
rest on reappropriated, reinvented concepts borrowed from the Islamic tradition.” (Yilmaz
and Bashirov, 2018, p.1822) For this reason, AKP's policy, which includes educational
reforms, stems from Islamism, not Islam.

2.2 Populism in Turkey under the AKP Government

Populism has always witnessed in Turkish politics. However, Erbakan was the first
politician who used religious populism most effectively in Turkish politics.
Although the founders of the Justice and Development party initially expressed that
they took off “national opinion t-shirt” and

they promised that they would not pursue a

policy based on the political use of religion, time showed that the real purpose of the
AKP

was very different from what they presented outside. In particular, the AKP and its

leader Erdogan seem to have decided on an authoritarian policy understanding and practice
supported by religious populism since 2011 (Mustafa Erdogan,2019).
Populism as an ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two
homogeneous and antagonistic groups, “the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite”, and
which argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale (general will) of
the people. According to Mudde (2004) populism is a ‘thin-centered’ ideology since the
particular ideas under its command are of limited scope, complexity, and ambition when
measured against ‘full’ ideologies (Cas Mudde, 2004, p.543).
Moreover, populist politicians see themselves as the representative of the nation.
Nonetheless, they tend to categorize people as People and Non-People, Outsiders and
Insiders, Us and Them.

Those who do not share the same idea are considered as

non-people for populist politicians. Therefore, in most cases, populist politicians do not
accept the notion of the opposite party or opposite people. People who do not support their
ideas, populist conception begins to “othering” those people, and this paves the way for
19

polarization like Turkey. Most importantly, populist politicians or parties do not want to do
only their responsibilities, they want to take over the government and manipulate
everything, and structure education according to their political goals. In short, they want to
be the owner of the country. Also, some who do not accept those owners, are
representative of the foreigners or external forces. Yilmaz and Bashirov argue (2018) that
populism also uses personalistic and paternalistic leadership. The populist leader usually
represents divine characteristics: He is possessed of the national will and the common good.
His authority and judgement are certain (Yilmaz and Bashirov, 2018, p.1820). All these
symptoms of populism mentioned above can be found in Erdogan's policy. In addition, he
uses this populist approach as a strategy to polarize and manage the country.
Moreover, the intensity of religious populism in AKP politics has increased
considerably in the last few years. Erdogan intensifies not only his religious populism but
also right-wing or national populism. Butler (2018) says:
Erdogan has said one of his goals is to forge a “pious generation” in predominantly
Muslim Turkey “that will work for the construction of a new civilisation.” His
recent speeches have emphasised Turkey’s Ottoman history and domestic
achievements over Western ideas and influences. Reviving Imam Hatip, or Imam
and Preacher, schools is part of Erdogan’s drive to put religion at the heart of
national life after decades of secular dominance, and his old school is just one
beneficiary (Butler, 2018).
To conclude, Erdogan frequently emphasizes that Islam and being a Turk are closely
connected. In this sense, he generally uses Ottoman Empire and historical facts of Turkey
in his national populism. He introduces religious values as an important part of being a real
Turk. Therefore, national populism affects Turkish education increasingly through
restricting minorities' right to education.

EDUCATIONAL REFORMS BY THE AKP GOVERNMENT (2011-present)

This chapter will examine what education aims in today’s Turkey, what educational
reforms are the main steps to realize the aim of Islamization of education, and how
educational goals lead to polarized society.
Schools in Turkey consist of 8 years of primary education and four years of high
school education.

Secondary education consists of general, vocational, and technical

curricula. However, high school is not a preparation for specific vocations but is meant to
prepare students for higher education. “There are four types of high schools in Turkey: fine
arts, multi-curricula, evening, and private” (Aydin, 2018, p.279).
Education is the activity of transmitting the scientific, artistic, religious, and moral
knowledge created by humanity for thousands of years from the previous generation to the
next generation. There are different approaches to the methods and ways to be followed in
this transfer. Accordingly, a fundamental distinction is whether education should be based
on subjective or local values such as religion, faith, and tradition, or based on positivist and
universal values such as scientific knowledge. On the other hand, he adds, it is possible to
make many different definitions of education. According to this, education is the
phenomenon that causes permanent behavioral changes in the desired direction. (Kilic,
2016) As a consequence, the answer to the question of what is a desirable citizen or what
is aimed by education determines the content of the education.
Throughout history, education has been at the center of individual, social, cultural
and political goals in every society because education is a permanent way to embed a new
ideology or vision. After Erdogan came to power, the main aim of education has been the
construction of pious generation through educational reforms. As a result, Islamization of
education reached its highest level in the AKP government period.
Reforms by the AKP government affected many sectors in Turkey, and education is
one of them. It changed its aim and has been restructuring under the AKP rule. In
particular, schools have been shaped to educate children appropriate to Erdogan’s politics.
Educational reforms have been designed to create a pious generation and desirable citizens
for the dominant party. Even though educationalists criticized his educational reforms, but
21

Erdogan says there will be no back step in government’s education reforms.

The AKP

government began to implement central educational politics after the formation of the third
government in 2011. Moreover, after the third AKP government, Erdogan got power and
clearly expressed his purposes in building a New Turkey through the elimination of the
secular identity of Kemalism and to build a new national identity. In this sense, he
eliminated his opponents one by one who can cause a threat to his dominance, and
education has been a main political tool in this way.
Moreover, two steps can be defined concerning the implementation of educational
reforms in the AKP government. The first step begins from the foundation of the AKP in
2002 and lasts until the formation of the third government in 2011. The first step is
characterized by the introduction of a neoliberal policy and the continuation of the previous
education policy and its underlying principles. Thus, there were no dramatic changes in
education in the first stage. However, most of the fundamental educational policy occurred
in the second stage, which restructured education under Erdoganism. The second step of
the AKP’s educational policies began in 2011 and continues to the present. (Durakpasa and
Karapehlivan, 2018, p. 70)
This chapter argues that educational reforms under the AKP rule are polarizing. After
a general review of education in Turkey educational policies will be presented in
chronological order.

3.1 Education before the foundation of AKP

The last years of 1990 were critical in Turkish education because Turkey intended to be a
member of the European Union and did some reforms in education relating to human rights.
Before the declaration of candidacy for the EU in 1999, human rights classes were added
to curricula.
The post-1980s are the period when Turkey more and more integrated into the
worldwide free-market economy and applied many reforms as a part of the effort to be an
EU member. Turkey has additionally enforced many reforms to bring its legal structure in
22

conformity with international agreements and human rights regimes. For example, in
response to the appeal by the United Nations for the implementation of human rights
education at the national level, a National Committee on the last decade for Human Rights
Education was formed in 1998. During the same academic year, "Democracy and Human
Rights", which was a new voluntary course, was added to the curriculum for 10th grade
(Cayir and Gurkaynak, 2007 p.53).
Furthermore, adding “human rights” to curricula was an essential reform however,
there were some problems. What kind of human rights were taught at the schools?
A section from “Citizenship and Human Rights Education” textbook published by
the Ministry:
Turkey has a very important geopolitical situation in the region and in the
world. Because of this reason, many countries have several aims in our motherland.
That is why Turkey is a country always under risk. The places that harbour
destructive terrorist organizations are neighboring countries which we think are our
allies” (Author of translation: Cayir and Gurkaynak, 2008).
First of all, for the first time in Turkish education history, human rights classes has
been added to the curricula. It was an important step for the EU membership of Turkey,
and at least basics of human rights had been taught in the grade 7th and 8th. However, the
negative side of education has been its particularistic approach to the conception of
citizenship. To some extent, textbooks that were prepared with the intention of teaching
human rights were intensely patriotic, nationalist, and exclusive for neighboring countries.

3.1.1 Nationalism through creation of the threats at the schools
Various forms of threats were presented in the 8th-grade textbooks: such as internal,
external, and current threats. External threat is related to the geopolitical position of Turkey.
Thus, some countries, especially neighboring countries, do not want the development of
Turkey, that is why Turkey is at risk. Those arguments take further steps and it is indicated
that many anti-Turkey terror groups have been organized in those countries.
23

By far, xenophobia in the official textbooks can be seen easily. Under the name of
national security, students were taught to perceive bordering countries as a threat.
Three kinds of threats were introduced in the textbooks; current, internal and
external threats. Neighbouring countries were included in external threat; opponents of
Kemalism in a country were considered as an internal threat. The current threat was
described as the combination of internal and external threats in the official books of
schools.
Fusun Ustel (2016) shows some parts of the official textbooks in Makbul
Vatandaş’ın Peşinde: II. Meşrutiyet'ten Bugüne Vatandaşlık Eğitimi. In the textbook, it is
stated that the common point of destructive, divisive and reactionary organizations is
against the principles of Atatürk. That is why expressions of “we are against the official
ideology” are indicative of their opposition to the fundamental qualities of the Turkish state
established by Atatürk. Moreover, people who consider Ataturk’s opinions as “the
imposition of the state's official ideology” want to disrupt the integrity of the country,
destroy the state and establish an outdated system in which their views are valid through
separation of the nation into races, classes, sects (Fusun Ustel, 2016, pp.306-307).
Therefore, people who do not support the dominant ideology had been considered as
the current threat to Turkey. Officials began to introduce “others” as separatists in the last
years of the 1990s.

3.1.2 The headscarf banning

Another chaotic situation and one of the most controversial issues has been a ban on
headscarves. Some parts of society argue that the scarf is a symbol of an Islamic system
that challenges secular. Others argue that the scarf is a requirement of their religious faith,
and its use is a democratic right. (Cinoglu, 2016, p. 677)
To give an example from the research titled The Picture of Polarization in KONDA’s
findings (2010), the answers to the covering of female students show that society is divided
into almost two parts (see Figure 1). The number of cases in which female
24

students ’headcover in primary and secondary education is“ false ”or“ completely false” is
49.6 percent. While 49.1 percent consider the cover-up of officials such as judges,
prosecutors and teachers to be right, 39.3 percent consider it wrong(Agirdir,2010,p.32).

B., 2010, June 13 - 16. Retrieved from https://bit.ly/2zG14Vd

Back to the foundation of Cumhuriyyet, there was no ban for wearing headscarf, but
there were no workers with headscarves in the institutions, as well. Toruk (2011) points out
that the discussion of the headscarf started after the 1960s' with the increase in the number
of students who were wearing headscarf at universities (Toruk, 2011, p.485). And this is
one of the main breaking points in the issue of headscarf.
A ban on wearing headscarf at the universities was accepted after the 28 February,
1997 coup. Ibrahim Toruk (2011) writes that the headscarf was again banned when Kemal
Gürüz, who was appointed as the chairman of YÖK (Council of Higher Education) on
February 28, and he instructed the rectors of the university not to allow students to enter
the universities with a headscarf (Toruk, 2011, p.487).
Besides, it should be emphasized that one of the most important days in Turkish
education was the 28th of February that is also called a “Postmodern Coup or the February
28 process. The military intervened in politics indirectly on 28th February 1997, and it was
the period when the headscarf ban reached its peak. This postmodern coup has a high
impact on education in Turkey. The postmodern coup paved the way for the generational
and ideological cleavage and reorganization within the Islamist movement that gave birth
to the AKP (Ozel, 2003, p.89). According Ozel, the AKP’s success has proximate as well
as structural causes. He argues that some series of events have shocked the Turkish people
25

over the past six years, and one of them was the postmodern coup, which was initially set
in train by the military on 28 February 1997 (Ozel, 2003, pp.86-87).
The postmodern coup dramatically influenced Turkey and its education system. A
ban on headscarf was accepted by the government after the coup. Ibrahim Toruk (2011)
writes that the headscarf was again banned when Kemal Gürüz, who was appointed as the
chairman of YÖK (Council of Higher Education) on February 28, and he instructed the
rectors of the university not to allow students to enter the universities with headscarf.
This caused a lot of protests and chaos in Turkey. In 1998, almost three thousand
students who did not follow the rule about headscarf ban were suspended from school, and
many were warned and expelled. In 1999, while the ban on open education and theology
faculties included students, the headscarf was forbidden at Cyprus universities. In 2000 and
2001, including the Imam Hatip schools, a ban was implemented on all public and private
universities in Turkey. According to Celik and Gurkaynak state that “ever since its
introduction, the headscarf ban faced massive opposition from the general population. The
most notable attempt to abolish the ban took place when AK Party and Nationalist
Movement Party (MHP) deputies sponsored a constitutional amendment in 2008
(Celik&Gurkaynak, 2008)
On the other hand, apart from major problems in education that mentioned above,
the series of events and disasters in the last years of the 1990s that mentioned above
emerged a need to have a new system. As Ozel states not only did these developments take
place during major dramatic economic, social and political changes, they also had a
sufficient impact on changing the course of Turkish policy (Ozel, 2003, pp. 86-87).

3.1.3 Education system in today’s Turkey

“Education, which is defined as the process of making intentional and terminal changes in
an individual’s behaviours by way of his life” (Gun and Baskan, 2013, p.229). Education
has sometimes been an important tool for people to adapt to social change (economic
reform) and to change society (e.g., nation-building) (Arnd-Michael Nohl, 2008, p.15).
26

In Turkey, education is among the main tasks of the state. The Ministry of National
Education also plays a vital role in fulfilling this task. The importance of access to
education is stated in Article 42 of the Turkish Constitution.

The Basic Law of National

Education numbered 1739defined the goals and principles of Turkish national education
(OECD, 2005, p.16). The main principle of the National education is to raise individuals
who adhere to Atatürk's principles and reforms, who adopt, protect and develop all values,
and educate citizens who are aware of their responsibilities towards human rights and the
Turkish Republic- which is a democratic, secular and social state. (OECD, 2005 p.16-17)
The Turkish national education system is divided into formal and non-formal
education.
Formal education is the regular education determined for people of a certain age
group and given in schools. It includes pre-Primary education, Primary education,
Secondary education, and Higher education institutions.

(Guven, 2007, p.363)

Pre-primary education is voluntary education for 3-5 years old children. The main
aim of pre-primary education is to provide physical, mental, and sensory development of
children and to prepare children for primary education. Pre-primary school education is
usually given in the kindergartens and nursing homes under the supervision of the
Ministry.
With a new “4+4+4” education model, since 2012-13, compulsory education has
been divided into a 4-year primary school, 4-year secondary school, and 4-year high
school.
Primary education includes children between 66 months and 10 years. It is free in
public schools. These schools provide eight (4+4) years of education. After completing 8
years of primary education, students begin the Secondary education for 4 more years.
Secondary education consists of general, vocational, and technical curricula.

Higher education is organized in universities as four-year degree programs or in
post-secondary institutions as two-year primary education programs. In addition, there are
two-year pre-assembly degree programs that provide vocational training.
The aim of non-formal education in Turkey is to teach adults to read and write, to
provide necessary information, to develop the knowledge and skills they have already
acquired, and to create new opportunities to improve their standard of living (Guven, 2007,
pp.363-364). The Ministry of National Education also oversees non-formal education in
Turkey. Non-formal education services aim to teach reading-writing, help to continue
education of students to finish their incomplete education, teach balanced nutrition and a
healthy lifestyle, teach people from various professions the knowledge and skills they need
to improve themselves, and so on. (TÜBİTAK, n.d.)

As a developing country, Turkey has many educational problems. Girls' education, high
illiteracy, religious education, curriculum, and multicultural education are some of the
crucial issues. ( Cinoglu, 2006 p.676) To improve the education system in Turkey, MONE
has some important obligations to implement on behalf of the state.
Following the OECD report on Turkish educational system show critical tasks of the

MONE:
30

i.

The first task of the MONE is to protect the principles and reforms of Atatürk

and to introduce historical, cultural, spiritual, moral, and national values in this direction.
ii. To raise active individuals who are responsible for society by becoming a
balanced and healthy individual in terms of body, mind, morality, and spirit.
iii.To regulate all kinds of formal and non-formal education institutions, and also
monitor education abroad for Turkish citizens.
iv. To work together to establish the curriculum, regulations, and educational equality

levels for the institutions of secondary education connected to the Turkish Armed Forces
(OECD, 2005, p.10).
For almost the last two decades, education has shifted away from scientific, secular,
and modern education. Since 2002, Turkey has repeatedly faced a change in its education
system. The Minister of Education changed seven times in the 18-year-old AKP
government, and the system has had a chaotic structure. During the AKP rule, education
became an important tool for making Erdoganism the dominant ideology and raising the
pious generation.
3.2 REFORM: 4+4+4

After the foundation of the AKP government, both structural and curricular reforms were
implemented that have considerably shaped education in Turkey.
One of these reforms that raise controversial public discussion is “4+4+4” introduced
by the Ministry of Education. Moreover, “Primary Education Law no 6287” passed on 30
March 2012, and made a radical decision in Turkish education system. This law, publicly
known as 4 + 4 + 4, which brought a sudden change in the Turkish education system. The
aim of this reform was stated as making the Turkish national education system more
competitive and meeting the standards of developed countries (Gun and Baskan, 2013,
p.229).
According to scholars, 4+4+4 is an essential step to create “pious generation” and
remove “Kemalism” from education. This reform is designed to include Erdogan’s
ideology to education, in other words, it is an ideological reform.

31

To clarify, Bay and Turkan (2013) explain that the 4 + 4 + 4 model has led to
significant changes in the Turkish education system. The previous “5+33” model applied
since 1997 has been replaced by the 4 + 4 + 4 model. Thus, primary schools were divided
into primary schools, secondary schools, Imam Hatip secondary schools, and fifth-grade
students entered the secondary school level. In addition, the age for starting school used to
be 84-72 months and according to the 4+4+4 model, children can go to school when they
turn 5 years old (60-72 months), and preschool education was not compulsory but left to
the parents' preference (Bay, Turkan et al.,2013, p.37).
Data proves a number of Imam Hatip schools have increased since the 4+4+4 model
applied. Nevertheless, the implementation of the new system intends to increase
investment for Imam Hatip schools. Data, as indicated by Reuters (2018), also shows that
the 4+4+4 system was designed to bring Erdogan’s ideology to education and intensify
new identity-building processes that contradict with secular identity.
According to the Reuters’ 2018-report:
Government budget and investment plans show that spending on Imam Hatip upper
schools for boys and girls aged 14 to 18 will double to 6.57 billion lira ($1.68
billion) in 2018 - nearly a quarter of the total upper schools budget. Although the
645,000 Imam Hatip students make up only 11 percent of the total upper school
population, they receive 23 percent of funding - double of what they spend per
pupil at mainstream schools (Reuters, 2018)
The following figure shows how much money the AKP government provided to
religious schools in 2018. Amounts were presented in Turkish lira.

The French model of state schooling (5+3 system) was adopted at the beginning of the Republic. This model provided
for primary schools, teaching a five-year curriculum, after which children could either cease their schooling, or proceed
to middle schools and, eventually, to high schools and universities. Technical and vocational schools were also provided
at each of the three higher levels, for graduates of schools at the previous stage (Başaran, 1996: 64).

Generation”. Reuters ( 2018, Jan.25) Retrieved from: https://reut.rs/3d9Jbge

In addition, figures indicate a rapid increase of Imam Hatip schools after the application of
4+4+4 reform.
Between 2012 and 2017, the number of Imam Hatip Lycees (upper secondary level)
increased from 537 to 1,485 and the number of students attending those schools
went up from 268,245 to 503,978. In 2016-2017 the total number of students in the
lower and upper level of Imam Hatip schools increased to 1,291,426. This number
was 71,100 when the AKP came to power Moreover, the statistics of the Ministry
of National Education of the last two years show that there are more girls (56%)
attending religious upper secondary level of Imam Hatip Schools than boys (44%)
(Egitim-Sen Report, 2017-2018,p. 4, Author of translation Funda Karapehlivan,
2019)

Figure 4 and Figure 5 below indicates that The number of Imam Hatip schools and
students attending Imam Hatip schools has increased significantly since 2012.

Further, both 5+3 and 4+4+4 have common sides. Both 5+3 and 4+4+4 education
models have been applied to serve the ideology of governments that have been in power.
What can be seen, both of models are examples of manipulated education. Lukuslu points
34

out that “education system that had been in place since the so-called postmodern coup of
1997 was a 5 + 3 years compulsory system, designed under the supervision of the
country’s then almighty military guardians to stem the rise of Islamism in general and
religious education in particular” (Lukuslu, 2018). Therefore, education policy (5+3) aimed
to prevent the increasing of Imam Hatip Schools and according to Kaya (2015), 5+3 model
intended to decrease the competitiveness of religious schools and make them undesirable
for the society. (Kaya 2015, p. 57) In this sense, it is important to look briefly at what the
Turkish education system achieved with the "5 + 3" model.
To some extent, the 5 + 3 model achieved the loss of influence of religious schools.
Kaya examines,
By then, Imam Hatip schools were recruiting students after the fifth grade. The aim
of the new law was to prevent families from sending their children immediately
after primary school, with the expectation that a child who went through an
eight-year secular education would be less likely to go on to an Imam Hatip School.
Hence the 1997 law closed down the first three-year section of Imam Hatip schools
(secondary level, years 6 to 8) while allowing the last four-year section to remain
open (high school level, years 9 to 12). (Kaya 2015, 57).
Erdogan considers changing the education model to 4 + 4 + 4 as the end of pressure.
However, the 3 + 5 model increased the attendance of girls at the schools. In addition,
thanks to the 1997 reform, the number of early marriages has decreased significantly. It
should be noted that child marriage is a severe problem in Turkey, and it is expected that
the 4 + 4 + 4 model will facilitate early marriages due to the possibility of not letting girls
go to school after the first four years.
According to a study by Istanbul’s Koc University and Tusiad, the Turkish business
federation, the proportion of girls married at the age of 16 fell 46 percent in the
succeeding years. Some business leaders voice concerns that the latest change
could reverse this trend. Umit Boyner, Tusiad’s chairwoman, has suggested the
proposed new system of separate infants and middle schools could also encourage
parents to keep their girls at home after the first four years. Tusiad adds that most
developed countries do not have specialist education before 16 and that a broad
education is important for a flexible labour force. (Daniel Domber, 2012)
35

Moreover, after applying the 4 + 4 + 4 model, the age of entry to primary schools
was reduced, and many new students began their studies the same year. As a result, there
were limited schools, and parents who preferred non-religious schools had to send their
children to religious schools. As a result of this, a 4+4+4 model achieved to make Imam
Hatip schools appeal to society again.
To summarize, the AKP government is striving for a new religious identity, and like
the previous government, the AKP government has implemented this policy through
education. To create a religious environment in Turkey, the AKP has implemented a 4 + 4
+ 4 education model, in other words, an ideological education model. Furthermore, this
model has led to an increase in the number of religious schools to reconstitute influence of
Imam Hatip schools and to stimulate schools for Islamization and desecularization of
Turkey when 4+4+4 educational reform caused the demand for more schools. In addition,
a 4 + 4 + 4 education model is predicted to lead to an increase in “homeschooling” and a
decrease in the number of girls in Turkey.
In all, taken into consideration, religious identity is one of the criteria for Erdogan’s
desirable citizens, 4+4+4 model developed to enter his identity into education.
In addition, his intention to promote religious identity through this educational
reform has been contradicted with previous secular identity, which in turn has driven
polarization in Turkey.

3.3 Revision of curriculum: Forbidden Theory Evolution

The AKP government has chosen to ban the theory of evolution and remove it from the
curriculum. Removing evolution theory is one of the reforms for the Islamization and
desecularization of the curriculum, which for the first time added to the curriculum by
Ataturk. That is why it is important to briefly review the history of evolution theory in
theTurkish education system.
36

Peker, Comert et al. ( 2009) state that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, initiated to add
evolution theory into the biology curriculum under the unification and secularization of
educational systems. In 1931, the MONE published a book about Darwin written by a
Turkish Darwinist. At that time, Darwinian evolution was considered as a valid scientific
theory and an important part of the science curriculum. “The young republic’s positivist
education philosophy was best captured in the famous dictum of Ataturk “the truest guide
in the world is the science”, Peker and Comert added (2009).
According to Peker and Comert, there were no significant changes in the way
evolution was taught between the late 1930s and early 1970s. From 1972, however, the
number of concepts about evolution covered in biology textbooks decreased. (Peker,
Comert et al., 2009, pp. 740-741) It is reported that at the end of the 1960s, current
controversial priest Fethullah Gülen published a book entitled "The Truth of Creation and
Evolution", which called for the creation of biology books that are compatible with the
Islamic values and foundations of Islam. The "creation against evolution" debate was an
integral part of the struggle between the two poles of Turkish society, namely the national
conservative front and the left groups in the 1970s (140 Journos, 2017).
The most dramatic change was implemented after the 1980 military coup regarding
evolution theory. In 1985, creationism was included in the biology curriculum by the
National Ministry of Education.

Peker and Comer state (p.741). Moreover, 140 Journos

reports:
The 1980 coup d’etat, however, had established a more authoritarian regime under
which academic freedom was restricted and religious conservatism was becoming
more active in public life. the 1990’s saw the entry of creationism into biology
textbooks as an alternative theory for origins of life (140 Journos, 2017).
Under the AKP rule, the evolution theory was removed from the current curriculum.
Moreover, as a part of the highly expansion of religious education under the AKP rule, the
concept of “jihad” was added as a part of Islamic Law. Ismet Yilmaz who was a former
minister of National Education (2016-2018) emphasized that “Jihad is an element in our
religion; It is in our religion… The duty of the education ministry is to teach every concept
deservedly, in a correct way. It is also our job to correct things that are wrongly perceived,
seen or taught” (Author of translation: 140 Journos, 2017).
37

However, some teachers have contested the removal of evolution theory from the
curriculum. A head of education and science workers’ union (Eğitim-Sen) Feray Aytekin
Aydoğan shared her opinion about the new curriculum:
We have become the second country on the face of the earth to exclude evolution
from high-school curriculum, following Saudi Arabia. Even in the Islamic republic
of Iran, the evolution theory gets mentioned in 60 pages and the theory of
Darwinism in 11 pages in the textbooks, Aydoğan stated. In addition, the head of
eğitim-sen also asserted that the new curriculum has nothing to do with the needs of
the education system and everything to do with political power’s ‘2023 vision’ and
its ambition to transform the totality of social relations according to its
political-ideological views. (Author of translation: 140 Journos)
To conclude, in all areas of education, there is a radical change from the curriculum
to the allocation of the general budget. Even scientific topics have been replaced by
religious content. The abolition of the theory of evolution is a clear example of the gradual
Islamization of the Turkish education system. That’s an example of how MONE is
reforming the curriculum based on Erdogan’s identity.

3.4 Islamization of curriculum

The third AKP government declared its aim to create a pious generation during a speech in
January 2012.
Erdoğan: There is the raising of a pious youth. […] Do you expect us, from the
AKP, which has a conservative identity, to raise an atheist generation? […] We will
be raising a conservative democratic generation, loyal to the historical values and
principles of the nation, and the fatherland. That is what we are working on
( Author of translation: Lukuslu, 2016, p. 640).
A few days later he added:

38

Do you want this generation to be a glue-sniffing (tinerci) youth? Do you want this
generation to be a rebellious one against their elders? Do you want this youth to be
torn apart from their national and moral values, to become a generation without a
certain direction or any mission? ( Author of translation: Lukuslu, 2016, p. 640)
In this way, revision of the curriculum such as application of 4+4+4 education model,
dismissals of unwanted teachers and academics, elimination of opponents and closing of
dersanes, increasing investment in religious schools, removing evolution theory from
curriculum, adding lessons about Jihad, introducing three selective courses: Quran, Prophet
Muhammad’s Life, and Fundamentals of Religion, transformation of general high schools
into vocational and technical high schools have been reforms under the AKP rule in order
to proceed the Islamization of curriculum and impose Erdoganism,
On the one hand, hours for biology and philosophy were reduced, and MONE
removed evolution theory from the textbooks. On the other hand, hours and content for
Religious Culture and Moral Knowledge courses were increased and have become
mandatory classes to attend. According to Kandiyoti and Emanet, adding new official
school commemorations such as The Holy Birth Week, the celebration of the birth of the
prophet Muhammed, scheduled on 24 April, totally overshadowed the republican
celebration of 23 April Children’s Day which marked the establishment of the first
republican parliament were harbingers of the intensifying political struggle between the
neo-Kemalist, secular constituencies, and the AKP. (Kandiyoti & Emanet, 2017, p.870)
Nonetheless, the transformation of general high schools played an important role in
replacing general high school to religious schools and fasten the process of creating a pious
generation. According to Kaya (2015) the transformation of general high schools into
vocational and technical high schools, many of which are, in fact, religious schools was the
most significant step for the creation of a more religious environment. Since the
2010–2011 school year, the ratio of vocational and technical high schools increased by
23%, and religious vocational schools increased by 73% (Kaya, 2015).

To summarize reforms on education, the changes to curriculum aimed to remove a
secular identity of Turkey and develop Islamic identity by adding much religious content in
the curriculum. These reforms strengthened the dual structure of Turkish education and
increased polarization in Turkey.
By far, it is possible to come across polarization in all countries. In particular, in the
multiparty period, different ideas in societies stem from the fact that people support
different parties, and this is normal. However, educational reforms that have been carried
out by the AKP government make the situation quite extreme. Erdogan intends to shape
education according to his identity, his ideology more important than the prevention of
polarization like Erbakan, who used to be his predecessors. In this way, Erdogan also
benefits from polarization while he raises the pious generation through educational reforms
and opposes this generation to the secular generation.

4 EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POLARIZATION

The right to education imposes on the state three levels of obligations: to respect, protect
and fulfill. For this reason, states should avoid any measures that may impede the
enjoyment of the right to receive education, such as closing a private school; States should
take measures that prevent third parties from interfering with the enjoyment of this right.
For example, states should implement policy to provide that everyone benefits from this
right, for instance, by taking positive steps to ensure that education is culturally appropriate
for minorities and indigenous people. (Kaya, 2009, p.11)
Bennett defines multicultural education as a democratic values-based approach to
teaching and learning that reinforces cultural diversity in culturally diverse societies, and
the primary goal of public education is to contribute substantially to the intellectual, social,
and personal development of all students to their highest potential (Bennett, 1999, p. 11).
Despite these regulations by international organizations, the current Turkish government
ignores all kinds of legal, conscientious, and ethical rules try to shape education in line
with Erdogan’s ideological goals.
In particular, the “polarize and rule” strategy has been dominant since the July 15
coup attempt. After the coup attempt, Erdogan’s speech was based on the division of
Turkey into Gulenists and Erdoganists. This polarizing attitude was also applied among
students, teachers and parents, and they faced authoritarian state surveillance.
The next section looks at the political relationship between Gulen and Erdogan and
how this relationship affected education in Turkey.

4.1 The Gulen Movement and its relation to Erdogan/AKP

Another example of using education as a way to impose ideology can be Erdogan and
Gulen relationship. Erdogan used the education to defeat Gulen who is another influential

42

person in Turkey and used the situation to put pressure on people, whom he considers as
“other”.
The political and societal alliance between the AKP and the Gulen movement
deserves to be scrutinized in greater detail” (Kaya, 2005, p.51). However, due to space
constraints, this section will examine their connection briefly to understand the current
situation in Turkey.
Since the AKP rose to power in 2002, the AKP has benefited from the substantial
support from Fethullah Gülen’s movement, with which it shares a moderate, liberal Islamic
ideology.

The alliance between Erdogan and Fetullah Gulen reinforced only in the

aftermath of the 2007 e-coup when generals once again caused the fear to demolish a
legitimately elected government. According to the secularist army, the election of Abdullah
Gul to the presidency represented a red line. Turkey was still polarized on the headscarf
issue these days, and Gul’s wife failed this militant test of Kemalist secularism. In the
wake of AKP’s landslide electoral victory in 2007 and the constitutional court’s (another
Kemalist stronghold) attempt to ban the AKP, the alliance between Erdogan and Gulen
turned into a formidable coalition against the Kemalist establishment (Balci, 2014).
Following this, after the AKP's landslide election victory in 2007 and the attempt by the
constitutional court (another Kemalist stronghold) to ban the AKP, the alliance between
Erdogan and Gulen developed into a formidable coalition against the Kemalist
establishment. This alliance ultimately launched the Ergenekon investigation against
militantly secularist generals in the armed forces. (Omer Taspinar, 2016)
According to Taspinar, Pro-Gulen elements within the military - largely at the level
of colonels in 2008 - undoubtedly provided much-needed inside information and legal
evidence for Ergenekon investigations, which cleaned up a lot of politically interventionist
military officers. However, some evidence provided by the Gulenists was manipulated.
This illegal situation led to politicization and ultimately de-legitimization of the Ergenekon
investigation. Nonetheless, Erdogan and the AKP supported the Gulen movement and the
Ergenekon investigation. (Omer Taspinar, 2016)
As soon as Erdogan defeated his enemy that caused a threat to the AKP government,
the AKP-Gulen alliance began to break. The alliance came to a final point in 2013 when
pro-Gulen judges alleged corruption against Erdogan. Shortly after the corruption crisis,
43

the AKP described the Gulen movement as a terrorist organization that aimed to overthrow
the AKP government.
Kandiyoti and Emanet (2017) claim that the corruption scandal broke out against key
persons in the Turkish government and participants who were differently associated with
the ruling AKP on December 17, 2013. Criminal proceedings started for bribery,
corruption, fraud, money laundering and gold smuggling. By December 25, resignations
and rearrangements in the cabinet followed. The government decisively blamed Gulenists
in the police and the judiciary, and the Jamaat was accused of attempting a "coup d'etat" in
the judiciary. (Kandiyoti and Emanet, 2017, p. 872)
The AKP government implemented the state’s oppression on academics with the title
of cleaning the state from terrorists in order words from the Gulenists.
However, how did it come to call Gulenists as terrorists while they were very close
until Erdogan was elected as prime minister?
The influence of the Gulenism increased on media, education, and many sectors year
by, and this process began to threaten AKP’s government. To give an example from Time,
the media organs run by pro-Gulenists criticized his clumsy handling of the Gezi Park
protests. The closure of the dershanes would be an important step for the weakening of the
Gulenist movement. In other words, dersanes were the most important thing that used to
keep the Gulen movement alive (Zalewski, 2013). This situation shows how education is
manipulated to instill ideologies and how it is the battleground between political
organization (AKP) and religious movement (Gulenism). Therefore, as it was mentioned in
“Time”, Erdogan hit the Gulenists where it hurted. Zalewski argues,
In mid-November, the prime minister announced that he would close down
the country’s private exam prep schools, or dershanes, roughly a quarter of which
are run by Gulen’s followers. The schools, he said, are perpetuating social
inequalities between those who can and cannot afford them, creating a parallel
system of education. The government has since moderated its tone, emphasizing
that dershanes would be allowed to operate until 2015, at which point they would
be “transformed” into private schools. (Zalewski, 2013)

44

The aggression between Tayyip Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen peaked in May 2016,
a few months before the coup attempt. Erdogan said in his speech that the Gulen
movement would be considered a terrorist organization like the PKK.
R.T. Erdogan:
We made a new decision yesterday. We said that it [the Gülen movement] is an
illegal terrorist organization. We made a recommendation decision regarding the
Fethullahist Terrorist Organization. We have sent it to the government and we’re
now waiting for the cabinet decision. We will register it as a terrorist organization. It
will be tried in the same category as the PYD [Democratic Union Party] and the PKK
[outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party] (Source: Hurriyet daily news, 2016).
Finally, the conflict between “two powers” ended up with a coup attempt.
On 15 July 2016, elements within Turkey’s armed forces attempted a violent coup
attempt, bombing the Parliament and other state and civilian infrastructure. More than 200
people were killed, and over 2,000 were injured. Few days later, a state emergency had
been declared by the government for three months. A state of emergency was extended
three times in order to counteract “terror organization” and protect national security. As a
result of a battle between Erdogan and Gulen, not only people involved in an attempted
coup but also Kurds and leftists who do not follow the Erdogan ideology were imprisoned,
removed and banned from public service with the decree-laws, dismissals, resignation and
retirement under a state emergency in Turkey.
Consequently, as Mustafa Erdogan states populist politicians used the polarization as
a political tool instead of phenomena to be solved and successively, this systematically
triggers the fear and hate toward the opposite.

4.1.2 The impact of the split between Erdogan and Gulen on education

After ending coalition, Erdogan ordered to shut down private preparatory schools, many of
which were run by Fethullah Gulen. There are many unknowns after the coup attempt on
45

July 15. Nevertheless, what is certain is that the Gulen movement was weakened by the
closure of dersanes, because the Gulen movement promoted Fetullah Gulen's ideas through
education, and in addition, those schools were a major source of income for Gulenist
movement. On the other hand, Dersanes were very successful schools in Turkey when
preparing students for secondary schools. Therefore education was significantly affected
by the division of Erdogan and Gulen. Closure of private schools and ‘cleansing’ of
schools from teachers that were suspected to have link with Gulenist movement have been
one of Erdogan’s main aims. The coup attempt was a good excuse for the AKP
government to target teachers as supporters of terrorism. Thus, state surveillance on
academies has been strengthened by the AKP government to keep education under control
and following this, Erdogan’s war has started on Gulenist schools all over the world.
Using the threat of “terrorism” is quite common in today’s politics. That is why, if
we check Erdogan’s speech, “terrorism” has been widely used. The expression of “War on
terrorism” is a way to justify the politics, reforms, implementations of the states. Thus,
"war on terrorism" has also been a reliable gun of the AKP government against its
opponents, which prevented the AKP's political dominance. Therefore, the threat of
terrorism strengthened the state's educational surveillance. The Guardians states that
Erdogan signed a decree to close 1043 private schools after the failed coup attempt (Letsch,
2016).
Consequently, closure of schools was fundamental step to provide political dominance.
Toguslu (2017) argues:

The Hizmet movement with its education network and media was seen as a
hindrance on his way to the executive presidency. At the beginning of this crisis,
the rift with the AKP was not felt in the places where there are Hizmet-affiliated
schools; however, as the AKP became stronger and won further elections in Turkey,
it increasingly polarised society. It first took control of the judiciary, then the
military. Erdoğan deepened the struggle with the movement by using the 15 July
coup attempt as an excuse, blaming the coup on the movement and as a result
uniting all his opposition against it. Next, Erdoğan began to take aim at the schools
abroad. He began to make calls to presidents and heads of state heads to demand
closing down the schools. Erdoğan has pursued this struggle abroad by founding
46

the Maarif Foundation and is now working on having the movement’s schools
abroad handed to the Maarif Foundation. It should be noted that according to this
plan the schools are to be supported and run through pro-AKP Islamist
associations.(Toguslu, 2017, pp.17–18)

A Turkish state-run education foundation has signed a memorandum of
understanding with 26 African countries to oversee schools belonging to the people of the
Gülen faith-based movement. “We have signed protocols with 26 countries in Africa, and
16 of them have so far transferred schools. We will continue to provide education to 8,900
students,” said Hasan Yavuz, a board member of the Maarif Foundation (SCF, 2018).
To clarify, on 17 June 2016, the AKP established the Maarif Foundation to host the
administration of the controlling schools associated with the Gülen movement. “30 African
countries have handed over the Gülen mobility schools to Maarif or closed them at
Ankara’s request.” (SCF, 2018)
Erdogan appoints himself as caliph, the leader of all Muslims in the world, and
considers the Maarif Foundation as a tool in his investment efforts to reach non-Turkish
Muslim groups. Just as he has directed billions of dollars allocated to secular public
education for Turkey’s religious public and private schools, Erdogan is trying to achieve
the same abroad by investing heavily in schools, mosques and cultural centers abroad. He
hopes that he can raise a generation of loyalists on foreign soil to attract new recruits. Just
as he has redirected billions of dollars earmarked for secular public education to religious
public and private schools in Turkey, Erdoğan is trying to do this abroad by investing
heavily in schools, mosques and cultural centers abroad. (Bozkurt, 2017) It can be seen that
replacing Gulenist schools does not aim to provide better education, it only aims to make
Erdoganism dominant ideology,mainly, in Muslim countries.
The Maarif Foundation in Turkey is about to carry out Erdogan's effort to export a
unique blend of its brand with an Islamist ideology that is polarizing, threatening, and
hostile. Even an examination of the profiles of its top management suffices to conclude that
this initiative may very well try to destabilize other nations, Bozkurt adds. (2017)
The figure below demonstrates how large Gulenist movement was before the July 15
failed coup.
47

To conclude, the AKP government used a state emergency as an excuse to cleanse
universities, schools from unwanted teachers who opposed Erdogan's policies towards the
Kurdish population and replaced them with "loyal" teachers. He closed all Dersanes after
the failed coup that the process of closing the Dersanes had started before the coup attempt.
Dersanes were very successful schools to prepare students for university entrance exams.
Anadolu agency points out that dershanes were privately run low-cost prep schools and
acting as supplementary educators for students who target to pass the entrance of higher
universities. Students received intense curriculum coverage and learned testing techniques
(Anadolu Agency, 2013). As soon as all of these were closed, they were replaced by Imam
Hatip schools, while there was a high demand in schools and many parents had to send
their children to Imam Hatips.
Nevertheless, government surveillance has increased after the failed coup d'état in
education, as well as many other sectors. Like Gezi, protests, this event has also intensified

48

the process of creating desirable citizens for the AKP government and increasing
polarization between desirable and undesirable citizens for the AKP government.
Consequently, as Mustafa Erdogan states populist politicians used the polarization as
a political tool instead of phenomena to be solved and this systematically triggers the fear
and hate toward the opposite ( M., Erdogan, 2019)
In this way, the 2017 failed coup helped Erdogan to realize his intentions. Thanks to
the failed coup, he played “the holy oppressed” and many important educational reforms
that restructured education in Turkey, especially implemented after his victory over
Fethullah Gulen. Moreover, “15 July” can be considered as a significant date to fasten to
build a New Turkey under the AKP rule.

4.3 Minorities in the Education System of Turkey
Education, including religious education, is a key factor in increasing religious and social
tolerance. Education also makes it possible to create empathy for people to whom
authoritarian governments can target because of people’s religious beliefs. Therefore,
education

can

be

the

shield

against

extremist

ideologies,

denominationalism,

discrimination and all this can attract the sensitive threads of a country's social structure.
That is why states must be careful about religious curricula in schools. They must prescribe
that

the

curriculum

characterizes

alternative

religions

accurately

and

without

generalizations, stereotypes, or languages that degrade or refer to the superiority of a
particular religion over others. (Meral,2015,p.1)

However, the AKP government began attracting wide criticism due to its
implementations due to political, regional, human rights, and religious matters. There have
been increasing concerns that the party was currently maintaining a politically exclusive
system, one rooted in a Sunni Muslim religious, national identity. Nowadays, religious
freedom is a complicated issue in Turkey. Political polarization, the government's policies
and measures since 2012 and rooted cultural wars create new complaints. People who do
not hold Sunni Muslim traditions feel that they are under pressure to adopt or follow a
particular political ideology, rooted in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. (Meral, 2015, p.6)
49

Accordingly, polarization between Alevis-Sunnis have come into prominence due to
the educational policy of Erdoganist regime. Under the AKP government, some mandatory
religion classes were added to curricula that teaching Sunni Islam. Alevis accept this
curricula as a way to impose Sunnah

and this tendency raises aggression among three

main axes. In particular, Since 2012, educational policies cause indignation of minorities,
and this paves the way for social polarization in society.
Minorities differ from the majority according to their ethnicity, religious affiliation,
or mother tongue. Among them, Alevis constitute the largest religious minority in Turkey.
The Alevis differ significantly from the Sunni Muslim majority in terms of practice and
interpretation of Islam (Minority rights in Turkey, 2010). Although the Alevi are the
largest ethnoreligious minority in Turkey, due to lack of official census data, their number
is unknown but estimated at between 10 and 15 percent of the total population.
(Acikel&Ates, 2011,p.715)
In fact, In the Constitution of Turkey, Religion education does not aim to teach any
rituals or any branch of Islam. As Kaymakcan emphasizes religion education curriculum
aims to teach faith, worship, and ethics, thus ignoring the social and political dimensions of
Islam. The reason for it is that such issues conflict with the Turkish understanding of
secularism. Like Turkey, secular states prefer the teaching of doctrinal and ritual aspects
that do not take part in secular government policies. It follows that Islam is not taught as a
definite way of life (Kaymakcan, 2002). According to the Constitution of Turkey, none of
the branches of Islam or specific religious movement are allowed to teach in schools.
…Everyone has the freedom of conscience, religious belief and
conviction. Acts of worship, religious rites and ceremonies shall be
conducted freely, as long as they do not violate the provisions of
Article 14. No one shall be compelled to worship, or to participate
in religious rites and ceremonies, or to reveal religious beliefs and
convictions, or be blamed or accused because of his religious beliefs
and convictions. (Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, 2019, Article 24, p. 17)
50

Therefore, Religion Course does not have to teach how to pray or fast, these classes
are for teaching universal values of Islam. However, last year, the content of the religion
course was dramatically changed. Adding selective religion classes to curricula and forcing
students to take those selective classes, changing content and aim of Religion classes are
the core signs of misusing the Constitution under the AKP rule. Teaching how to pray
according to Sunni rules, values of Sunni faith are the main of today’s Religion Class.
Despite Religion Culture and Moral Knowledge classes are only stated as compulsory,
however, students are forced to take selective religious classes. This shows that the current
government does not consider Article 2

(right to education), Article 9 (the right to

freedom of thought, conscience and religion), Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)
and Article 24 ( prohibition of abusing religious feelings) on educational policies.
…Everyone has the freedom of conscience, religious belief and
conviction. Acts of worship, religious rites and ceremonies shall be
conducted freely, as long as they do not violate the provisions of
Article 14. No one shall be compelled to worship, or to participate
in religious rites and ceremonies, or to reveal religious beliefs and
convictions, or be blamed or accused because of his religious beliefs
and convictions. (Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, 2019, Article 24, p. 17)
In ECHR Press Release (2014) it is stated Alevi applicants complain that the content
of compulsory courses in religion and morality in schools is based on the Sunni
understanding of Islam. The Court observed that the Turkish education system, in
particular in the field of religious education, still does not have sufficient equipment to
ensure respect for parents' convictions. Referring to Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (right to
education), the applicants complained that the content of compulsory classes in religion
and ethics in schools was based on a Sunni understanding of Islam (ECHR 257, 2014).
The reason why courses that are alleged to be voluntary importantly affect Alevis
and trigger polarization between Alevis-Sunni rather than other minorities is that
Christian and Jewish students can be exempt from those religious classes because they are
51

Lausanne minorities. Yet, as it is argued in the article titled Forgotten or assimilated?:
Minorities in the education system of Turkey, Alevi children cannot be exempted from
these classes because Alevis are non-Lausanne4 minorities, and Alevism is seen as part of
Islam by the authorities. It is a particular belief encompassing very different religious
practices which are not referred to in the textbooks. A young Alevi stated that in primary
school, he was once asked by the teacher to pray in the class, refused to do so, and faced
pressure and violence for this. (Kaya, N.,2009, p. 21).
Therefore, Religion Course does not have to teach how to pray or fast, this class are
for teaching general values of Islam. However, last year, the content of the religion course
was dramatically changed. Adding selective religion classes to curricula and forcing
students to take those selective classes, changing content and aim of Religion classes are
the core signs of misusing the Constitution under the AKP rule. Teaching how to pray
according to Sunni rules, values of Sunni faith are the main of today’s Religion Class. In
spite of Religion Culture and Moral Knowledge classes are only stated as compulsory,
however, students are forced to take selective religious classes. This shows that current
government does not consider Article 2

(right to education), Article 9 (the right to

freedom of thought, conscience and religion), Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination)
and Article 24 ( prohibition of abusing religious feelings) on educational policies.
Accordingly, polarization between Alevis- Sunnis has come into prominence due to
the educational policy of Erdoganist regime. Under the AKP government, some mandatory
religion classes were added to curricula that teaching Sunni Islam. Alevis accept this
curricula as a way to impose Sunnah

and this tendency raises aggression among three

main axes. In particular, Since 2012 educational policies cause indignation of minorities
and this paves the way for social polarization in a society.
Nevertheless, beginning to teach 'live the Qur'an and Sunnah' for Alevis is one of the
examples of how interests of the current government have been realized through Ministry
of National Education.

According to the Lausanne Peace Treaty, signed in 1923 between Turkish and Allied forces after the First World War,
only three non-Muslim groups are accepted as minorities: Armenians, Rum Orthodox (Greeks) and Jews. Other Muslims,
non-Muslims and other ethnic minorities, such as Alevis, Laz, are not officially recognized as minorities, which limits the
exercise of some of the political and cultural rights of these groups.
(Source: Minorities and indigenous peoples in Turkey, Minority Rights, (n.d.) https://minorityrights.org/country/turkey/
52

According to the news of Democrat Haber, in Avcılar, where the Alevi population is
densely populated, the District Directorate of National Education established an
organization in order to teach morality and ethics in Sunni Islam. The "movement", which
was approved by the Avcılar District Governorship, was decided to be implemented within
a specific program in all educational institutions in the district from primary school to high
school. (Diken, 2015)
Sunni implementation to be held in schools will not be accepted, said Gökhan
Çimen, president of the Avcilar Cultural Association, the government has a policy to
impose Sunni faith on Alevis. If our children are pushed to such an implementation, they
will encounter a severe resistance, because Avcilar is a district where Alevis densely live,
and Alevi institutions are organized. If the decision is carried out , the Directorate of
National Education will plan to protest, to organize the signature campaign and mass
actions are also on the agenda, he said. Education unions and Alevi organizations are also
responsive to the decision. (Diken, 2015)
Mehmet Kirsanlilioglu argues that at every stage of education, children's personality
rights are systematically violated, and they are made the material of a certain ideological
approach. It is not a coincidence that places like Avcılar were chosen for this. They are
disturbed by the diversity in the social and cultural structure of Avcılar. They do not
tolerate differences. They want to make everybody uniform. (Diken, 2015)
It can be seen from the above example that polarization occurs due to absence of
equality to education. Article 24 states that Religion and Moral education are compulsory;
other religious education will be dependent on people’s own will.

…Religious and moral education and instruction shall
be conducted under state supervision and control. Instruction in
religious culture and morals shall be one of the compulsory lessons
in the curricula of primary and secondary schools. Other religious
53

education and instruction shall be subject to the individual’s own
desire, and in the case of minors, to the request of their legal
representative. (Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, 2019, Article 24, p. 17)
On the contrary, the AKP’s reforms have widely expanded the religious content of
the curriculum only on the basis of Sunni faith.
This proves that the ideology of the current government accepts diversity as a threat,
and restricted diversity and absence of equality in education causes social polarization.
Negative feelings and negative attributes to other groups
Nobody is permitted to misuse religious beliefs for the sake of individual or political
aims or to use any religious principle at any scale as the base for the set up of governance
in any context.
…No one shall be allowed to exploit or abuse religion
or religious feelings, or things held sacred by religion, in any
manner whatsoever, for the purpose of personal or political interest
or influence, or for even partially basing the fundamental, social,
economic, political, and legal order of the State on religious
tenets. (Constitution of the Republic of the Turkey: October 2019, Article 24, p.
17)
The Turkish Constitution, adopted in 1982, following the 1980 military coup,
introduced a mandatory religious culture and ethics class for primary and secondary
schools. The Constitution supports the teaching of Religion Education and it is stated in
Article 24. Nevertheless, Turkey has been a secular country since 1937. According to the
Constitution of Turkey, Religion Culture and Morals courses should take the form of
‘teaching about religion’ rather than ‘teaching religion’. However, the AKP government
does not follow the way of teaching religion as stated in the constitution and interprets
statements according to its own interest, such as imposing pluralist ideology on minorities.
54

Consequently,

education policies express the AKP’s intentions towards minorities.

Educational implementations do not respect diversity but one identity that is pursuing
Erdoganism and desirable for the current government. These policies are perceived

as

assimilation strategies in order to impose a dominant ideology and Sunni Islam on
minorities. This, in turn, leads to anger in a society that the AKP's understanding of
freedom of conscience, religious belief and conviction is limited to the demands and
desires of its own constituency.
Nevertheless, the approach of considering supporters of other parties as non-people
increases polarization and does not allow to solve this phenomenon. As Kaya (2009) points
out, religious education is a controversial subject in Turkey, and there are different
opinions regarding the decision. As a result,

the ministry essentially needs to develop a

participatory approach, work together on this issue and find common interests for a
solution. Any proposed changes should respect the principles of secularism, objectivity,
pluralism and respect for the beliefs and preferences of parents (Nurcan Kaya,2009,p.23).
Otherwise, social polarization will continue if the dominant party designs educational
policies with the aim of shaping identities and pursuing nation-building strategy according
to Erdoganism.
To conclude, it can be seen from the above example that polarization occurs due to
absence of equality to education. Article 24 states that

Religion and moral education are

compulsory, other religious education will be dependent on people’s own will. On the
contrary, The AKP’s reforms have widely expanded the religious content of the curriculum
only based on Sunni Islam.
4.4 Discussion

The dramatic increase in Imam Hatips is one of the indicators of the Islamization of
education in Turkey. Taken into consideration, the majority of people are Sunni Muslims,
it is, therefore, understandable that there are religious schools in the country. However, the
current government invests too much money in religious schools as analyzed in chapter 4,
and violates the rights of other people to education. Education policies express the AKP’s

55

intentions towards minorities. Implementations do not respect diversity but one identity
that is pursuing Erdoganism and desirable for the current government.
In addition, elective courses have to be voluntary, however, the elective system does
not work well in Turkey. Alevis and other minorities do not have a chance to be exempt
from “selective religious classes” and extracurricular activities. These policies are
perceived as assimilation strategies in order to impose a dominant ideology and Sunni
Islam on minorities. This, in turn, leads to anger in a society that the AKP's understanding
of freedom of conscience, religious belief and conviction is limited to the demands and
desires of its own constituency.
Nevertheless, which movement you are a member of is increasingly determining
your career. Many teachers and educationalists could not continue their careers because
they were supposed to have a link with the Gulenist movement. The approach of
considering supporters of other parties as non-people or even supporters of terrorist
organizations increases polarization and does not allow to solve this phenomenon.
It is natural to have social clusters with different opinions, values and lifestyles in a
society. However, if the differences of opinion between these clusters completely
contradict each other, mutual intolerance and the disappearance of the will to live together
go to a dangerous direction, towards social polarization (Agirdir, 2010, p.27). In this
phenomenon, when the country's education is manipulated to impose certain ideologies, it
seems that polarization is not happening on a single political issue or area, and there can be
polarization in many dimensions.

5 CONCLUSION

Turkish society has faced a growing level of polarization since President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Not only the constitution of Turkey had been changed, but
also educational reforms fueled polarization and social intolerance. This thesis focused on
educational reforms to Islamization of curriculum have been implemented during the
2010s.
Education is one of the areas that has been influenced by the AKP policies a lot. The
headscarf issue and nationalist curricula at the schools were the main controversial issues
in education before the foundation of the AKP. During AKP rule, the main aim of
education has been to promote Erdoganism. Because one of the primary purposes of
Erdoganism has been constructing a new identity and pious generation through education.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s purpose caused a growing level of polarization. Not
only the Constitution of Turkey had been interpreted according to Erdogan’s policy, but
also his educational policies fueled polarization and social intolerance.
Education changed its aim and schools have been restructured to educate children
appropriate to Erdogan’s politics. Therefore, the main aim of educational policies by the
AKP government was to create a pious generation and desirable citizens for the dominant
party. Education policies have been restructured on the basis of Erdoganism in which
authoritarianism, political Islam, and populism are the main characteristics of his ideology.
This thesis analyzed following changes in the education system:
Changing the structure of primary and secondary schools from 5+3 to a 4+4+4,
closing dersanes (Fethullan Gulen’s school) and increasing the number of Imam Hatip
schools that serve a widespread of Erdogan’s ideology, the addition of optional secondary
school religion courses in 2012; the second and more extensive revision of the curriculum
and textbooks in 2017-2018.
With these structural changes, the AKP integrates its conservative ideology into the
education system. According to the Constitution of Turkey, Religion Culture and Morals
course should take the form of ‘teaching about religion’ rather than ‘teaching religion’.
However, the AKP government does not follow the constitutional way of teaching religion
57

and interprets statements in its own interests, such as imposing pluralist ideology on
minorities.
Initially, Erdogan favored a political alliance with Fethullah Gulen in order to fight
with secular institutions. The AKP government used the power of Gulen movement when
Erdogan wanted to get power against Kemalist establishments. In this sense, Erdogan
allowed to increasing dersanes which was the main financial source of Fethullah Gulen.
Attracting many students to dersanes, meant attracting many new followers for Gulenist
movement. However, once Erdogan and Gulen’s common enemies were defeated, the
coalition was also ended. Erdogan wanted to be only dominant in Turkey, and dersanes
were closed.
To conclude, the Turkish Constitution, adopted in 1982, following the 1980 military
coup, introduced a mandatory religious culture and ethics class for primary and secondary
schools. The Constitution supports the teaching of Religion Education and it is stated in
Article 24. Nevertheless, Turkey has been a secular country since 1937. According to the
Constitution of Turkey, Religion Culture and Morals courses should take the form of
‘teaching about religion’ rather than ‘teaching religion’. However, the AKP government
does not follow the way of teaching religion as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of
Turkey. In the meantime, the current government interprets statements according to its own
interest, such as imposing pluralist ideology on minorities.
The implementation of 4+4+4 education model as well as the removal of evolution
theory from the curriculum, adding new religious classes, organizing extra-curricula
activities that serve to impose Sunni belief were analyzed in order to answer how
polarization is traced in Erdogan’s educational policies.
Moreover, Religious education is a controversial topic in Turkey, and there are
different opinions on the decision. As a result, the ministry must fundamentally develop an
inclusive education model, work together on this issue and find common interests in the
solution. All proposed changes must respect the principles of secularism and objectivity.
The content of the courses should be developed in collaboration to include all beliefs.
Otherwise, social polarization will intensify if the ruling party devises educational policies
to shape identities and implement a state-building strategy in line with Erdoganism.
