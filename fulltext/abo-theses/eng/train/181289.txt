Title: A network approach to opportunity exploration and exploitation in an emerging
market – A study on Finnish SMEs operating in the Cleantech sector
Supervisor: Irene Kujala
Abstract: Emerging markets can provide business opportunities for small and mediumsized businesses. Pursuing opportunities in such markets is a current topic for Finnish
cleantech SMEs in particular. The markets for clean technologies are often found abroad,
where environmental issues tend to be more prominent. However, small firms often face
challenges related to resource constraints that can limit their possibilities to pursue
foreign market opportunities.
Research on the topic of how SMEs explore and exploit international opportunities is
still rather limited. This thesis aims to develop an understanding of what constitutes
opportunity exploration and exploitation among Finnish cleantech SMEs pursuing
opportunities in the emerging market of India and the role of business network
relationships during the process. A qualitative multiple-case study involving three cases
was chosen as the methodological approach. The data was mainly gathered through
semi-structured interviews with managers from the case companies.
The findings reveal that the SMEs identify opportunities through a combination of
accidental happenstance, discovery, and search. The opportunities are exploited through
various activities such as evaluation, networking, product modification, information
exchange, and knowledge acquisition. Business network relationships facilitate
international opportunity development through resources such as knowledge, advice,
and new network contacts. The findings illustrate that SMEs seek support from
relationships particularly for opportunity realisation. Drawbacks related to business
relationships are few. Cultural differences, passiveness in communication, and
difficulties in receiving on-time payments were the challenges experienced among the
studied SMEs. The findings provide managerial implications that could be beneficial to
consider when managers intend to utilise network relationships in the development of an
international opportunity.
Keywords: International opportunity, opportunity exploration and exploitation,
business network relationships, internationalisation.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Emerging markets are quickly transforming their economies and unlocking their markets,
resulting in profitable opportunities and completely new playing grounds for Western
goods and services (Sheth, 2011). Consequently, these markets have developed into
important and interesting places for future business activities (Cavusgil, Ghauri and
Agarwal 2002; Sandberg, 2013) and SMEs may find it profitable to grasp the
opportunities arising (Sheth, 2011).
SMEs often seek growth through internationalisation (Lu & Beamish, 2006). As smaller
firms they are characterised by having less resources, which inflicts upon their
possibilities to enter foreign markets (Holmlund & Kock 1998), including their ability to
identify business opportunities (Eriksson et. al, 1997), and access relevant business
market knowledge (Fiedler, Fath and Whittaker, 2017). Such deficiencies can be a
disadvantage as internationalisation starts with finding and seizing opportunities outside
national borders (Kock, Nisuls and Söderqvist 2010). To address resource gaps, SMEs
may turn to their network to compensate their own restricted capabilities (Sandberg
2013). Network relationships are especially highlighted when the smaller firm pursues
opportunities in emerging markets since such markets are in many aspects different from
the developed ones (Fiedler et. al, 2017).
Pursuing opportunities in international markets is a current topic for Finnish cleantech
SMEs. Cleantech firms provide solutions to facilitate sustainable use of natural resources
and function as drivers of sustainable growth (Saarenketo et. al, 2018). The largest
markets for such business are found abroad, where environmental issues are more
prominent (Finnvera, 2016). Rapidly industrialising nations such as India are in specific
need of solutions to control environmental impact and meet the basic demand of energy,
water, sanitation, health care, education and infrastructure (Yrittäjät, 2012). Finnish
cleantech SMEs have high potential on global markets, but the commercialisation of
Finnish cleantech product and service innovations has yet to reach its full potential on the
global scene (Saarenketo et. al, 2018). Several institutions have emphasised the
opportunities that the cleantech sector provides to the Finnish economy (Leinonen, 2019).

Regardless of this, information on how cleantech SMEs internationalise is scarce, and the
development of such information and the inherent success factors, could contribute to the
international growth of firms within this sector (Saarenketo et. al, 2018).
Against this background, this study sets out to develop an understanding how SMEs
operating in the cleantech sector in Finland explore and exploit opportunities as they aim
to enter the emerging market of India. Due to challenges smaller firms face in means of
resource constraints as well as the distinctiveness of conducting business in emerging
markets; this study pinpoints the influence of business network relationships during the
process.

1.2 Research gaps
The concept of opportunity is well established in the literature. Yet, there is little
consensus on what an opportunity is (Short, Ketchen, Shook and Ireland, 2010). Within
international entrepreneurship research the opportunity concept has evolved into quite a
common research topic and it has been studied in various contexts (Mainela, Puhakka and
Servais, 2014). Opportunities have been studied by for instance Kirzner (1997), Eckhardt
and Shane (2003), Ardichvili, Cardozo and Ray (2003), and Ellis (2011). Among the more
recent studies with a specific focus on international opportunities are those of for instance,
Kontinen and Ojala (2011), and Bai and Johanson (2018). The former study found that
Finnish SMEs recognised international opportunities through weak network ties formed
at international trade exhibitions.
Several studies revolve around the antecedents of opportunities and how cognitive and
learning processes influence opportunity development (Short et. al 2010; Alvarez, Barney
and Anderson 2013). However, there have been calls for more research integrating the
study of opportunities in a network context (e.g., Johanson and Vahlne 2009; Ciravegna,
Lopez and Kundu, 2014). Studies that observe the role of networks for international
opportunity development are those of for instance, Blankenburg Holm, Johanson and Kao
(2015), Vasilchenko and Morris (2011) and Zaefarian, Eng and Tasavori (2015). Many
of the past studies are qualitative case studies, while there seem to be a lack of quantitative
research combining networks and opportunities (Bai & Johanson, 2018). While some
studies highlight the importance of networks during opportunity development, few

2

Minna Svenfelt

studies discuss the potential drawbacks of network relationships during the process (Ellis,
2011).
Furthermore, the development of international opportunities among SMEs have not been
the focus of many in-depth studies (Hilmersson & Papaiannou 2015). In fact, the overall
process of exploring and exploiting opportunities in an international setting is still a
relatively underdeveloped research area (e.g., Chandra et. al 2009; Johansson & Vahlne
2006, Ellis 2011), despite the central role of opportunities in the internationalisation
process of firms (Johanson & Vahlne, 2009; Hilmersson & Papaiannou 2015). For
instance, there have been calls for more research on how firms recognise international
opportunities, since such opportunities can be seen as a driving force in
internationalisation (Chandra, Styles and Wilkinson, 2009). While a number of studies
focus on how opportunities are recognised by people or firms, less attention has been
given to the topic of how opportunities are exploited (Alvarez, Barney and Anderson,
2013). After all, it is only through exploitation that real economic value can be achieved
(Blankeburg Holm et. al, 2015).
In sum, research on the topic of how SMEs explore and exploit international opportunities
is still rather limited. Moreover, the rise of emerging markets still generates a multitude
of opportunities for new research (Sheth, 2011). Such studies can for instance, examine
how companies from developed economies approach growth opportunities in emerging
market environments (Sakarya, Eckman and Hyllegard, 2007).
With regard to the current state of research on international opportunities, this study
acknowledges the potential of further studies on the topic of how SMEs explore and
exploit opportunities in their aim to enter an emerging market, as this remains an
underdeveloped research area. This thesis further integrates a network perspective, which
in turn answers the call for more research implementing a network context to the study of
international opportunities. The thesis topic is approached by studying multiple case firms
within the cleantech sector in Finland. From an empirical standpoint, this thesis
contributes with further understanding of the internationalisation behaviour of Finnish
cleantech SMEs in particular, while providing practical insight into cleantech firms, on
the utilisation and impact of business network relationships, in the pursuit of growth in a
culturally and physically distant market. The theoretical contribution of this thesis seeks
to complement extant literature on business networks, internationalisation and also

3

Minna Svenfelt

international entrepreneurship (IE), as for the process of opportunity exploration and
exploitation in an international setting. Moreover, there have been calls for research
involving a variety of firms besides the early internationalising ones within the field of
IE research. (Young, Dimitratos and Dana, 2003). The present study can be regarded as
a contribution to such requests, as it aims to study international opportunity exploration
and exploitation from the perspective of SMEs and does not particularly focus on early
internationalising firms.

1.3 Research questions and objective
With regard to the above discussion on research gaps, this study aims to develop an
understanding of what constitutes opportunity exploration and exploitation among
Finnish (cleantech) SMEs pursuing business opportunities in the emerging market of
India, and the role of business network relationships during such a process. Thus, this
thesis seeks to understand the activities involved in the international opportunity
development process, and the ways that the SME engage with other business network
actors to pursue an opportunity in a foreign market. The aim of this study is supported by
the following research questions:
RQ1: How do SMEs explore and exploit opportunities (in international markets) through
business network relationships?
RQ2: How are opportunities explored and exploited among Finnish Cleantech SMEs
aiming to enter the Indian market?
RQ3: What are the benefits and drawbacks of using business network relationships
among Finnish Cleantech SMEs internationalising to India?
RQ4: What are the implications for SME managers involving business network
relationships in international opportunity development?

1.4 Focus and limitations
The focus of this thesis is on business network relationships and their influence on
opportunity exploration and exploitation activities among Finnish cleantech SMEs

4

Minna Svenfelt

pursuing their first international exchange opportunities in the Indian market. Hence, this
study takes interest in both the exploration and exploitation aspect of opportunities.
Consequently, focus is set on opportunities that have led to actual business operations in
a new foreign market. The intent is to develop an understanding of the activities
undertaken by SMEs to identify and realise an opportunity. To draw boundaries to the
study, phases of business concept development are excluded. Influencing factors such as
cognition and personality traits among the entrepreneurs/managers in the studied SMEs
are also beyond the scope of this study. In conclusion, the core interest is with the
activities SMEs engage in to develop an international opportunity and the influence of
business network relationships during the process.
Networks can be studied from different perspectives. Therefore, one must consider the
complexity of studying the subject and implement boundaries to the research (Halinen &
Törnroos, 2005). In this thesis, business networks are studied on the level of relationships
and it focuses on the direct relationships a company has with other actors in the network.
Furthermore, the study applies a focal firm perspective. This entails that the subject area
is solely examined from the case company point of view. The focal actor perspective,
(actor-network), refers to how a specific actor such as a company and/or individual views the business network. (Halinen & Törnroos, 1998). Here, the focal business
network refers to the most important actors that the case companies have had direct
contact with during international opportunity development.
The geographical context is India and the studied SMEs have already entered the Indian
market. The aim is to contribute with findings that are mainly applicable within the
specific context of SMEs entering the emerging market of India. However, emerging
markets are also discussed on a general level due to the distinctiveness of conducting
business in such markets. Moreover, this study is sector-specific as it concerns Finnish
SMEs operating within the cleantech sector.
As for research methodology, this thesis is a qualitative study that applies a multiple-case
study approach involving three cleantech SMEs. Data is primarily collected through
semi-structured interviews with a representative from each case company. Secondary data
sources are also used to complement the data gathered through interviews. Research
strategy, research design, as well as the process for data collection and analysis will be
further presented in chapters 4.1 – 4.2.

1.5 Key concepts and definitions
Small and middle-sized enterprises (SME): This thesis adopts the definition provided by
the European Commission, in which small and middle-sized enterprises refer to
businesses that employ fewer than 250 people and have an annual turnover below 50
million euros, or an annual balance sheet total that does not exceed 43 million euros.
Some 99% of businesses in Europe are classified as small and middle-sized enterprises
(European Commission, n.d.).
Opportunity: The opportunity concept is defined in numerous ways in prior research.
Opportunities can be viewed as circumstances, in which new goods and services can be
introduced and sold with the benefit of financial gain (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000, p.
220). An international opportunity is within the context of this study understood
according to the view by Ellis (2011) as; “the chance to conduct exchange with new
partners in new foreign markets” (p. 101). Hence, international opportunities are here
viewed as opportunities leading to new business operations in a new foreign market. From
the perspective of the focal firm, it is “the opening up of a new market”. From the
perspective of the exchange partner or buyer, the outcome is a new point of supply (Ellis.
2011).
Ellis (2011) uses the term exchange since it is the basis of value creation. The course and
outcome of the exchange is in turn dependent on context, and it is influenced by the
characteristics of the exchange partners (Ellis, 2011). Exchange can be conducted with
e.g., distributors, wholesalers, retailers, contract manufacturers, franchisees, or licensees.
The type of exchange partner is not central. Instead, the exchange should be
unprecedented (Ellis 2011).
The term ‘Opportunity’ is often seen combined with other terms such as recognition,
identification, discovery, search, exploration, scouting – and so forth. While some studies
distinguish between these word combinations, others use them interchangeably. This
study uses ‘opportunity exploration’ as a collective term for the before mentioned.
Furthermore, this study maintains a distinction between exploring and exploiting
opportunities. The distinction is based on the view of Bengtsson, Eriksson and Kock
(2005). According to Bengtsson et. al (2005), exploration refers to activities related to the
identification of opportunities. Such activities may include monitoring, search and

6

Minna Svenfelt

creation. Exploitation refers to activities undertaken to enact an opportunity. Such
activities may include evaluation, realisation, implementation, refinement, and
commercialisation. Although this thesis separates the two concepts, it is acknowledged
that the concepts can sometimes be intertwined and overlap.
Internationalisation: In line with the network view, internationalisation can be seen as
process, in which international business relationships are established and developed
through interaction and influences of actors, activities and resources (Håkansson &
Snehota, 1995).
Business Networks: Anderson, Håkansson and Johanson (1994) define business
networks as “a set of two or more connected business relationships, in which each
exchange relation is between business firms that are conceptualized as collective actors”
(p 2).

In the business network, firms can have relationships with e.g. customers,

individuals, suppliers, competitors, distributors, government and public and private
support agencies (Coviello & McAuley, 1999).
Cleantech: There are many definitions available for the term Cleantech. The Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland, defines cleantech as: “products, services,
processes and technologies that promote sustainable use of natural resources and prevent
or reduce the negative environmental impact of business operations” (Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland, n.d.).

1.6 Structure of the study
The introductory Chapter 1 is followed by a contextual background Chapter 2 - in which
the study’s context of emerging markets and the cleantech field of business are briefly
presented. Chapter 3 introduces the literature review. The literature review is divided into
two main chapters, namely The Opportunity Exploration and Exploitation Process and
Business Networks and Relationships. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the discussion on
research methodology, including a discussion on the chosen method of research, a
description of the data collection process and a discussion on the trustworthiness of this
study. The empirical part of this thesis starts with Chapter 5 and a brief introduction to
each case company that have taken part in this study, where after the empirical data from
each company is presented. The data is analysed in Chapter 6, and followed by the

7

Minna Svenfelt

concluding Chapter 7, in which the conclusion, implications and suggestions for further
research are presented. Chapter 8 presents a brief Swedish summary of this thesis.

2 CONTEXTUAL BACKGROUND
The purpose of this chapter is to present the contextual background of this thesis in more
detail, by opening up the concepts of clean technologies, Finnish cleantech and emerging
markets.

2.1 Clean technologies
‘Cleantech’ is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of products, services, systems
and processes, whose common factor is reduced environmental impact and sustainable
use of natural resources (Confederation of Finnish Industries, 2015). Cleantech
companies do not constitute a homogenous group, as these firms cannot be categorised
into some specific branch of industry (Saarenketo et. al, 2018). Cleantech as a term is
rather recent, although it has become increasingly adopted among businesses and
investors globally. The use of clean technologies decreases harmful impact on the
environmental surroundings either directly or through the value chain. The cleantech field
of business compromises multiple industries including; renewable energy and energy
efficiency, air quality, waste and water management, environmental monitoring and
measuring, materials recycling and material efficiency among others (Sitra, 2007).
Environmental legislation has traditionally been the driving force of growth for
environmental business. Besides drivers of legal nature there are several global
megatrends that contribute to the demand for clean technologies around the world. These
include globalisation, urbanisation, climate change, the prosperity of the middle-class in
developing nations, insufficient supply of clean water, as well as waste of natural
resources and the scarcity of energy and raw materials (Sitra, 2007). These trends are
evident in India, where the need for cleantech solutions is felt across various sectors, due
to the nation’s fast-growing economy, rising population and its commitments towards
socio-economic development and sustaining economic growth. At the same time, the
country strives for a sustainable path of development (FICCI/EY, 2013). Since India’s
release of its National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008, in which they outline key
objectives related to climate change and sustainability, the Indian Government has
directed increased priority to progress and development within the field of renewable
energy resources and environmental technologies. To achieve progress in accordance

9

Minna Svenfelt

with the designated plan, a number of incentives and policies have been undertaken by
the Indian government in recent years (FICCI/EY, 2013).

2.2 Finnish Cleantech SMEs
Finnish cleantech firms are for the most part manufacturing driven, while consumerdriven innovations are rare (Etla, 2015). In 2017, there were around four thousand SMEs
operating in the cleantech sector in Finland (Confederation of Finnish Industries, 2017).
However, specific numbers can be difficult to determine as cleantech does not constitute
an industry of its own. Instead, cleantech is considered to extend across multiple
industries, as it is rather a matter of new business models that take into account
environmental aspects. Hence, cleantech can be created in all sectors of the economy
(Kotiranta et. al, 2015).
As is the case for many small or middle-sized businesses in Finland, the operational
environment of the small market area tends to be the main driver of internationalisation
among cleantech firms seeking growth. Changes in national and international regulation
have also been found to trigger internationalisation. Regulatory changes in target markets
may constitute a reason for international expansion even in such cases where the cleantech
company does not necessarily possess optimal market knowledge and expertise. As for
the internationalisation paths, the cleantech firms tend to first enter developed foreign
markets that are culturally and geographically close to Finland (Saarenketo et. al, 2018).
Reviewing the development and outlook of the cleantech sector is not entirely an
unambiguous task, since whether a business qualifies to be classified as ‘cleantech’ varies
among different estimates that have been published. This is due to the absence of a precise
and broadly used definition of the term and lack of consensus on what justifies a company
to call itself cleantech. Consequently, estimates are not fully comparable (Leinonen,
2019). The public authority for statistics – Statistics Finland - have published statistics on
the turnover from environmental goods and services sector in Finland, which here
functions as a reference to the current state of cleantech in Finland. In 2018, the turnover
for environmental goods and services sector in Finland was EUR 40 billion, while the
value of exports was around EUR 9 billion, and the value added reached nearly EUR 16
billion. This is a two percent decrease in turnover, and a five percent decrease in exports
compared to the previous year, while the share of value added has remained roughly the
10

Minna Svenfelt

same since 2012. Construction represents the largest industry within the environmental
goods and services sector. The majority of the 2018 revenue, 85 percent, was related to
management of natural resources, and the remaining share of 15 percent was related to
environmental protection. In the former, management of energy resources constitutes the
largest product category, followed by management of minerals and water supply. The
largest product categories in environmental protection are in turn waste water- and waste
management (Statistics Finland, 2019).

2.3 Emerging markets - India
In broad terms, ‘emerging markets’ (EMs) refer to countries with social or business
activity undergoing a process of rapid growth and industrialisation (Guégan, Hassani and
Zhao, 2014). Emerging market countries have quickly transformed their economies and
the development has led some of them to become attractive places for investment
(Cavusgil et. al, 2002). EMs are said to offer opportunities for long-term growth that can
be difficult to find in advanced markets characterized by high competition and market
saturation. The factors that contribute to long-term growth opportunities in EMs are
economic liberalisation, large populations, growing middle classes, less competitive
markets, and the growing number of young consumers (Sakarya et.al, 2007).
In this thesis, emerging markets are defined in line with Hoskisson et. al (2000) as; “lowincome, rapid-growth countries using economic liberalisation as their primary engine of
growth” (p. 249). There are plenty of definitions available for emerging markets (Arnold
& Quelch, 1998). There are also numerous approaches that can be applied to classify such
economies and depending on approach taken different economies will qualify (Gaeta,
2013). Cavusgil et. al (2002, p. 4) point out that all developing countries are not to be
considered emerging markets. There are certain characteristics that can be taken into
account to differentiate these economies from the developed ones, and those developing
economies that cannot qualify as emerging markets. Economies that have initiated an
economic reform process to lessen certain issues related to e.g., Inadequate infrastructure,
poverty and overpopulation, and in addition, have achieved a stable growth of GNP per
capita, can be regarded as emerging markets (Cavusgil et. al, 2002).

11

Minna Svenfelt

A common feature of emerging markets are institutional voids that impede on the
functioning of markets and contribute to operational challenges and higher transaction
costs. While developed markets have a variety of institutions and intermediaries that
create good conditions for buyers and sellers to connect, emerging markets tend to fall
short on this aspect (Khanna & Palepu, 2010). Furthermore, the lack of proper physical
infrastructure along with high level of corruption tend to impose challenges for companies
operating in these markets (Cavusgil et. al, 2002). Companies that intend to enter these
markets must also prepare for the influence of cultural differences on business operations
(Sakarya et. al, 2007).
With a population around 1.2 billion, India is the largest democracy (The World Bank,
2021), second most populous country, and the third largest economy, as per purchasing
power parity terms (IBEF, 2019). In recent years, the country has made significant
achievements in means of lowering poverty levels, as an estimate of 90 million people
have been brought out of extreme poverty and improved their living standards due to the
country’s strong economic growth (The World bank, 2021). India is generally an
agricultural country that is further characterized by its large iron and steel industry, while
the industry for information technologies has continuously grown in importance. The
industrial sector is diverse, and the country produces all types of manufactured goods.
Since its independence, the sector of small-scale industries has been a significant platform
to India’s economic development strategy, because of its abundant contribution in means
of employment, output and exports (Loikala et. al, 2006). In recent years, Finnish firms
have experienced increased ease of conducting business in India, due to the country’s
developments of its business and innovation environments (Confederation of Finnish
Industries, 2012).

3 THEORY AND LITERATURE REVIEW
A study on international opportunities such as the present one necessitates a brief
introduction of the entrepreneurial and international entrepreneurship fields of research,
since literature from these domains will be drawn upon in this first chapter of the
theoretical background. The opportunity concept is deeply rooted in entrepreneurship
literature and it is a prominent feature to this research domain. (e.g. Short et. al, 2010).
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) argue that entrepreneurship research revolves around
opportunities, as they state that entrepreneurial research concerns; “The study of sources
of opportunities; the processes of discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities;
and the set of individuals who discover, evaluate, and exploit them” (Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000, p.218). In recent times, entrepreneurial research has shifted focus
away from studying people, and the ways that people may act in entrepreneurial ways due
to certain personality traits or characteristics. Instead, the emphasis now tend to be on a
process and behavioural approach to opportunities, where focus is set on understanding
the circumstances in which people and firms identify and exploit opportunities (Chandra
et. al 2009). This thesis takes a process approach, and opportunity exploration and
exploitation is studied from an SME perspective.
While entrepreneurship literature takes interest in opportunities found in domestic
markets, international entrepreneurship literature is focused on studying opportunities in
international settings. Zahra and George (2002) describe international entrepreneurship
as; “the process of creativity discovering and exploiting opportunities that lie outside a
firm’s domestic market in the pursuit for competitive advantage” (p. 261). McDougall
and Oviatt (2005) in turn, define international entrepreneurship as “the discovery,
enactment, evaluation and exploitation of opportunities – across national borders – to
create goods and services” (p. 540). In general, international entrepreneurship studies
focus on born globals and international new ventures, i.e. firms that are characterized by
rapid internationalisation (Dimitratos and Jones, 2005). In addition, the studies tend to
revolve around firms that operate in knowledge-intensive fields (Kontinen & Ojala,
2011). However, the definitions presented by Zahra and George (2002) as well as Oviatt
and McDougall (2005), allow for the incorporation and research on SMEs, as these
definitions make no exclusions based on speed of internationalisation or which industry
a firm operates in (Kontinen & Ojala, 2011).

13

Minna Svenfelt

Although this thesis studies opportunities from the perspective of SMEs, previous studies
on opportunities within the field of entrepreneurial research contribute to the theoretical
framework of this thesis, as will be explained in the following. In line with Abebe and
Angriawan (2014, p. 339), this study maintains the idea that exploration and exploitation
activities occurring on the individual level, constitute the origins of exploration and
exploitation on the firm level, and that these activities are performed as a result of
information processing done by managers (Abebe & Angriawan, 2014; Lubatkin, Simsek,
Ling and Veiga, 2006). This is especially the case in SMEs, where managers tend to be
more involved in the firms everyday business operations (Jones & Macpherson, 2006).
It then follows, that exploration and exploitation taking place in SMEs is influenced by
the company managers and their way of interpreting information (Abebe & Angriawan,
2014). Against this background it is here proposed, that prior studies on entrepreneurship,
although from the perspective of the individual entrepreneur, can make a valuable
contribution for developing an understanding of how opportunities are explored and
exploited on the firm (SME) level.

3.1 Opportunity Exploration and Exploitation
From a broad perspective, international opportunities are favourable, yet uncertain
circumstances in foreign markets that present firms to the possibility of initiating new
international exchange (Blankenburg Holm et. al, 2015). The development of an
opportunity is a process that starts with the firm identifying potential information that can
be further processed and implemented to generate economic profit (Blankenburg Holm
et. al, 2015). Thus, after an opportunity has been identified, it must be enacted (Bai &
Johanson, 2018), as it is only through exploitation that financial gain can be achieved
(Blankenburg Holm et. al 2015). In subsequent sections (3.1.1. – 3.1.5.) the opportunity
concept is discussed in more detail, with regards to its origin and definitions. Thereafter,
the activities that constitute opportunity exploration and exploitation will be presented,
along with a review of one of the few models depicting the process of opportunity
exploration and exploitation. The first main chapter of the literature review is then
concluded by reviewing literature with an explicit focus on international opportunity
development in SMEs.

3.1.1 Definitions and the origin of opportunities
The opportunity concept has been subject to many discussions. Consequently, there are
many definitions available (Hilmersson & Papaioannou 2015). In recent years, the
concept has received criticism, due to the inconsistent use of the term in studies on
entrepreneurship (Alvarez & Barney, 2020) In a content analysis of international
entrepreneurship research, in which the opportunity concept had been implemented,
Mainela et. al (2014), state that the use of the opportunity concept is: “often depicted in
rather abstract and unspecified ways, and the research suffers from narrow theoretical
discussion in relation to the concept of opportunity. “ (p. 105).
A common view is that opportunities come into existence due to competitive
imperfections in markets. Some market actors can turn these imperfections into economic
value by exploiting the prevailing imperfections (Alvarez, Barney and Anderson, 2013).
The definitions provided by Eckhardt and Shane (2003) as well as Sarasvathy et. al (2003)
are among the most common and cited definitions of the concept (Mainela et. al, 2014).
According to Eckhardt & Shane (2003) an opportunity is defined by; “Situations in which
new goods, services, raw materials, markets and organizing methods can be introduced
through the formation of new means, ends, or means-ends relationships” (p. 336). In the
definition proposed by Sarasvathy et. al (2003), an opportunity is defined as “A set of
ideas, beliefs and actions that enable the creation of future goods and services in the
absence of current markets for them” (p. 79). As for opportunities present in foreign
markets, Ellis (2011) defines such opportunities as: “the chance to conduct exchange
with new partners in new foreign markets” (p.101). This is also the definition adopted for
this study. According to Ellis (2011) new international exchange can be conducted with
for instance, joint venture partners, contract manufacturers, customers, distributors,
franchisees, or licensees.
A question of debate in prior research is the origin of opportunities (Alvarez & Barney,
2020). It has been debated whether opportunities are consciously searched for or a matter
of discovery or creation (Short, et. al, 2010). Those advocating ‘discovery’ tend to assume
that opportunities emerge through exogenous shocks in pre-existent markets and
industries. Such shocks can lead some to notice new information in the form of
opportunities that can be further implemented and exploited. Others advocate that
opportunities are created by those who seek to create economic value. In this sense, the

15

Minna Svenfelt

existence of opportunities is not dependent on exogenous shocks. Instead, opportunities
can be created through actions performed by people (Alvarez & Barney, 2013). Ardichvili
et al. (2003) are advocates of the view that opportunities are created, as they state that:
“opportunities are made, not found” (p. 106). Similarly, Krueger (2000) express that “we
do not find opportunities, we construct them” (p. 6). Short et. al (2010) take a middle
ground by stating that (2010) “some opportunities are discovered whereas others are
created” (p.54).
The different views surrounding the concept are to a large extent based on the differences
in Kirzners (1973) and Schumpeters (1934) views on the nature of opportunities
(Hilmersson & Papaiannou, 2015). Kirznerian opportunities emerge from disequilibrium
in the economy, which entrepreneurs act to restore (Åkerman, 2015). According to this
view, opportunities are “out there” waiting to be discovered and exploited by someone.
(Short et. al, 2010). Kirznerian opportunities’ are thus beyond the actions of anyone and
exist regardless of whether people are aware of them or not (Mainela. et. al 2014).
According to Kirzner (1997), opportunities are objective and pre-existent, and available
to those who are able to recognize what has been previously overlooked, perhaps due to
one’s own sheer ignorance. Kirzner (1997) reasons, that the discovery and exploitation
of opportunities is a matter of being alert to the opportunities available and the possibility
of turning them into profit. Possessing a certain ability to spot opportunities is what
Kirzner refers to as “entrepreneurial alertness”.
The Schumpeterian view is on the other hand based on the assumption that an opportunity
is the outcome of entrepreneurial action (Shane, 2012). The entrepreneur creates and
combines resources in new and innovative ways which leads to market disruptions. Such
opportunities tend to have new and novel value in the market. While the contrast between
these views are evident and common in the literature, they are also seen as
complementary, in the sense that the market provides room for different types of
opportunities (Hilmersson & Papaiannou, 2015).

3.1.2 The opportunity exploration and exploitation process
Ardichvili et. al (2003) developed a three-stage model depicting the process of
opportunity formation (see figure 1). The authors argue that opportunities are rather made
than found. While some aspects of opportunities can be recognised, opportunities will

16

Minna Svenfelt

always require creative input. This leads the authors to apply the term “opportunity
development”, which incorporates both the recognition and creation aspects of
opportunities. The process includes the recognition of opportunities, as well as the
evaluation and development of opportunities. The development process is cyclical and
continual and it occurs simultaneously with opportunity evaluation. According to the
authors, it is likely that the opportunity will undergo changes and multiple evaluations
during different phases of development. Repeated evaluations can also induce new
opportunities or adjustments to the initial idea of an opportunity (Ardichvili et. al., 2003).
The process of opportunity formation is initiated when individuals possess as a certain
level of entrepreneurial alertness. This type of alertness is thought to be enhanced and
influenced by certain personality traits, social networks, relevant prior knowledge and
experience. Opportunities may evolve from simple or unformed concepts to more
elaborated and detailed ones, as they are further developed through proactive efforts
(Ardichvili et. al, 2003).

Figure 1: A model of opportunity identification and development (Ardichvili et. al 2003, p. 118)

The core process includes perception, discovery, creation, development and evaluation.
Hence, in this model, opportunity recognition includes the perception, discovery and
creation of opportunities. The reasoning behind this is the different processes through
which opportunities come to be recognised; 1) Through sensing or perceiving market

17

Minna Svenfelt

needs, 2) By discovering the possibility to match certain market needs with certain
resources, 3) By forming business concepts through creating an unprecedented match
among hitherto separate market needs and resources (Ardichvili et. al, 2003, p.109).
Opportunity evaluation tend to be informal and uncommunicated up to a certain point.
Furthermore, evaluations are likely to take place under different stages of development.
The development and evaluation process turn into more formal in character, when a
conclusion is reached on whether certain market needs, and/or resources require further
investigation. Further examination of an opportunity may include e.g. analysing whether
accessible resource combinations will transfer into desired economic value. The
opportunity can be re-examined or aborted, if it is deemed to not carry any further
potential in means of development and implementation (Ardichvili et. al, 2003).
Although the model does not explicitly illustrate the process in the context of international
opportunities, nor is it specifically intended to depict the process for SMEs , it still
captures the basic elements of the opportunity exploration and exploitation process; from
prerequisites for opportunity recognition to exploitation of opportunities through the
continual and simultaneous phase of evaluation and development. In the next chapter
3.1.3, the influencing factors (personality traits, social networks, entrepreneurial
alertness, and prior knowledge) will be briefly reviewed.

3.1.3 Opportunity Exploration
Within entrepreneurship and international entrepreneurship literature, ’Opportunity
exploration’ is referred to in different ways such as; opportunity recognition, opportunity
discovery, opportunity identification, opportunity seeking and opportunity construction
(see e.g. Kontinen & Ojala, 2011, Hilmersson & Papaiannou, 2015; Muzyschenko &
Liesch, 2015). In this study, ‘opportunity exploration’ is used as a collective term for the
before mentioned. According to Bengtsson et. al (2005), opportunity exploration can refer
to activities such as monitoring, search and creation.
Entrepreneurship literature has dealt with the topic of what leads some to identify
opportunities, while others may not (Angelsberger et. al, 2017). Several influencing
aspects has been suggested to influence the process. On the level of the entrepreneur,
cognitive properties and prior knowledge are thought to be important. (Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000). Ellis (2011) mentions a firm’s participation in social and business
18

Minna Svenfelt

networks, while Ardichivili et. al (2003) mention social networks, prior knowledge,
personality traits and entrepreneurial alertness. This study will not focus on how
personality traits or cognitive properties of the entrepreneur affect opportunity
exploration and exploitation. Yet, it is deemed appropriate to briefly review what these
influencing aspects imply for the opportunity exploration and exploitation process.
According to Ardichivili et. al (2003), personality traits such as optimism and creativity
are positively linked to the ability of recognising opportunities. Optimism can have a selfconfidence strengthening tendency. Such a trait also tends to influence the way one thinks,
in the sense that one might see opportunities rather than threats. Such a trait can also
increase trust in one’s own ability to achieve challenging goals and overcome difficult
situations. As for creativity, higher level of creativity is considered to strengthen
entrepreneurial alertness.
Shane (2000) argues that prior knowledge is an important element influencing
opportunity recognition, since information related to what one already knows is easier to
notice. The type of knowledge particularly useful for opportunity identification can be
categorised into three dimensions; knowledge of markets, knowledge of ways to serve
the market and knowledge of customer problems. Such knowledge facilitates seeing value
in new information, and thus, it also facilitates opportunity recognition. Hilmersson and
Papaioannou (2015) highlight that relevant prior knowledge also tends to reduce the
perceived risk and uncertainty of enacting opportunities in the context of a foreign market
opportunity. Baron (2006) suggests that prior knowledge can be viewed as a source of
reference that assists in the exploration of ‘patterns’ that could indicate new business
opportunities. In this sense, having prior knowledge of e.g. certain industries, markets, or
a group of customers, can facilitate the development of more specified products. Shane
(2000) further argues that entrepreneurs can only identify opportunities that are related to
their prior knowledge. In this respect, opportunities are not obvious or available to
everyone that could potentially come across them, since the ability to spot an opportunity
is restricted by one’s cognition and previous knowledge. Consequently, it is unlikely that
the same kind of opportunities are identified among different people (Shane, 2000).
As for the influence of entrepreneurial alertness - some people are thought to have a
capability of sensing opportunities as they come across them. Such individuals tend to be

19

Minna Svenfelt

observant of their surroundings while they also possess a forward-looking attitude
towards the opportunities available (Kirzner, 1997).
The importance of networks for opportunity exploration has been highlighted in several
studies. For instance, some studies have shown that entrepreneurs with broader networks
tend to recognise more opportunities than those less involved in networks (Hills et. al
1997). For internationalising SMEs, business networks and relationships are considered
to play a key role in means of resource acquisition for opportunity exploitation (see e.g.
Vasilchenko & Morris, 2011; Coviello & Munro 1997; Crick & Spence, 2005).
Opportunity exploration through networks can lead to positive outcomes through the
stream of information and subsequent opportunity exploitation - or to limited
advancements with regard to opportunity development due to scarce flow of information
and resources among a firm´s extant network ties (Lindstrand & Hånell, 2017). Thus, the
quality of the exchange taking place in network relationships have an influence on the
extent to which opportunities are identified and exploited (Blankenburg Holm, Eriksson,
& Johanson, 1996; Lindstrand & Hånell, 2017). The role of network relationships for
opportunity exploration and exploitation will be further discussed in chapter 3.3.

3.1.4 Opportunity Exploitation
Opportunity exploitation involves acting upon an identified opportunity and it refers to
the activities undertaken to realise an opportunity. Such activities may include evaluation,
realisation, implementation, refinement, and commercialisation (Bengtsson et. al, 2005).
Thus, exploitation refer to actions undertaken to transform an identified opportunity into
economic activity (Åkerman, 2015) Much of the extant opportunity literature revolve
around the identification or discovery of opportunities (Blankenburg Holm et. al 2015),
while the topic of how opportunities are exploited have received less attention (Alvarez,
et. al, 2013, p.301).
Opportunity exploitation has mainly been described to involve activities such as
evaluation, the organisation of resources and acquiring legitimacy (Söderqvist, 2011).
Kuckertz et. al (2017), emphasise that opportunity exploitation is a multifaceted activity,
that can constitute for instance; 1) the development of a product or service based on the
perceived opportunity, 2) the acquiring of suitable human resources 3) understanding
customers and the market 4) gathering financial resources and 5) setting up the

20

Minna Svenfelt

organisation. According to Shane and Venkataraman (2000), opportunity exploitation is
preceded by evaluation. The decision to exploit an opportunity when it is undergoing
evaluation is influenced by the type of opportunity as well as differences in characteristics
among different people. While the first one is related to the opportunity’s demand,
expected returns and costs, the latter one has to do with differences in risk taking among
different people.
Foss et.al. (2013), argue that to enact an opportunity firms engage with different external
parties for the sake of acquiring complementary and important knowledge. This is
especially likely in the case of a unique or complex opportunity that requires use of
specialised knowledge. Since firms may not hold all knowledge themselves, they may
acquire relevant knowledge through contact with a myriad of external sources. Such
contacts can provide direct assistance, technical advice, contribute to problem solving or
shed light on contextual information that may incite exploitation and influence its
outcomes. For instance, a firm may engage with industry associations to acquire
knowledge on industry specific standards.

Furthermore, interaction with external

knowledge sources facilitate a firm’s understanding of e.g., competitor technologies and
products. For a firm seeking to develop an opportunity interactions like these are useful
and perhaps even unavoidable to realise the opportunity (Foss et. al, 2013).

3.1.5 Exploration and Exploitation of International Opportunities
Opportunities have a central role in the internationalisation process of firms (Kontinen &
Ojala, 2011), and the field of international entrepreneurship has revealed that the
discovery and enactment of opportunities are important for understanding the
internationalisation behaviour of firms (Mainela et. al, 2014). As a result, some suggest
that internationalisation can be viewed as a process in which the firm develops an
international opportunity (Hilmersson & Papaioannou, 2015), while other studies view
opportunities as triggers or initiators of internationalisation (e.g. Chandra, 2009; Johanson
& Vahlne, 2009). Yet, the opportunity aspect has been scarcely recognised among
existing internationalisation theories. Instead, opportunities are taken as given, while little
is said about why and how opportunities are recognised (Chandra 2009; Ellis, 2011).
Johanson and Vahlne (2009) noted this deficiency in their revisited Uppsala model of
internationalisation, as they now suggest that opportunities drive internationalisation
(Blankenburg Holm et al, 2015). It has also been suggested that opportunities are

21

Minna Svenfelt

recognised as a reflection of earlier experiences that firms gain by being a part of business
networks. (Hohenthal, Johanson and Johanson, 2014).
To explore and exploit international opportunities implicates that the firm identifies and
makes use of opportunities found beyond national borders. According to Ellis (2011), an
international opportunity is the possibility to conduct exchange with new partners in
international markets. Exchange can be conducted with e.g., Joint venture partners,
contract manufacturers, customers, distributors, franchisees, or licensees. (Ellis, 2011).
Once an opportunity is identified, it is usually exploited by utilising various resources
(Kontinen & Ojala, 2011). According to Ellis (2011), negotiating an exchange agreement
with a new partner in a new foreign market constitutes solid evidence of opportunity
exploitation.
To the benefit of firms striving for international expansion, advancements in technology,
production, and telecommunication have made it less complicated to take advantage of
business opportunities abroad. Due to these same advancements, it is also easier to
maintain and establish relationships across country borders. Moreover, increased
travelling to foreign destinations provide people the opportunity to come across ideas and
new circumstances that may be further developed into exploitable business opportunities
(Geursen & Dana 2001).
International opportunities can be explored by using network contacts and previous
experience unique to the firm (Kontinen & Ojala, 2011). Åkerman (2015) suggests that
firms transfer previous experiences of opportunity exploitation to enact opportunities in
new markets, by utilising knowledge gained through earlier experiences. Previous
experiences of actions that have proven successful for the SME are indeed valuable when
aspiring for growth in new markets. (Hilmersson & Papaioannou, 2015) Söderqvist
(2011) found that international opportunities were explored at trade fairs and through
formal search on the internet. According to the findings made by McAuley (1999),
international trade fairs and network contacts provide more information about
opportunities abroad than any other source of information. The main motives for taking
part in trade fairs are often related to information gathering about e.g., markets, products,
trends, and for the purpose of networking. (Evers & Knight, 2008). Literature also
suggests that exploration can take place in everyday business activities, where planning

22

Minna Svenfelt

or routines turn into the discovery of an opportunity (Hohenthal, Johanson and Johanson,
2003).
Some SMEs systematically search for new opportunities in foreign markets and may in a
sense act upon opportunities despite limited information available. Others are less active
and systematic, almost to the point that the firm’s international business operations come
across as unplanned or accidental (Hilmersson & Papaiannou, 2015).

Accidental

circumstances can prompt an entry into a foreign market, implicating that there has not
been much intention to opportunity exploration and exploitation activities beforehand
(Muzychenko & Liesch, 2015). An example of this are spontaneous contacts or orders
from potential customers and partners in foreign markets, that can push the firm to make
quick decisions without having a full picture of the opportunity and the risks associated
with it (Crick & Spence, 2005). Active or systematic search for opportunities on the other
hand, can be initiated by certain circumstances, or a particular problem, such as a firm’s
declining sales, market share, profit, or increased competition (Chandra et. al, 2009).
Unexpected events beyond the control of firms, such as radical changes in law and
regulations, may also constitute a ground for new opportunities (Blankenburg Holm et.
al, 2015).
Past research reveals that there are both internal and external factors that influence
international opportunity development among SMEs (Hilmersson & Papaioannou, 2015).
As for the “opportunity search behaviour” among SMEs, past studies indicate, that the
international experience of the firm influences the way opportunities are searched for
(Hilmersson & Papaioannou, 2015). That is, whether the identified opportunities are
outcomes of active and intentional search or rather a matter of accidental discovery.
Chandra et. al (2009), found that while firms with extensive international experience and
knowledge tended to search for international opportunities in a purposeful and systematic
way, firms characterised by having less international experience where on the other hand
more likely to discover opportunities by accident. Similarly, Hilmersson and Papaioannou
(2015) found that SMEs with more international experience searched for opportunities in
an active and systematic way, compared to SMEs with less experience of conducting
business in foreign markets. In a study on Family SMEs, Zaefarian et. al (2015), found
that the firms where likely to recognise their first international opportunities by accident,
while later international opportunities were discovered by purposefully searching for

23

Minna Svenfelt

them. These findings are in line with Schweizer et al (2010) and Johanson and Vahlne
(2009), who argue that international experience is an important internal determinant for
international opportunity development.
Angelsberger et. al (2017) conducted a literature review on international opportunity
recognition, in which they present the findings of a study conducted by Piantoni,
Baronchelli, and Cortesi (2012). The study concerned Italian SMEs internationalising to
China and EU markets. The findings revealed that the SMEs tended to recognise
international opportunities in close markets through active networking and systematic
search behaviour. In such cases, the SMEs also had comprehensive knowledge and prior
experience. In such cases, where the SME had limited prior knowledge and experience,
the opportunities were in turn accidentally discovered. The market opportunities in China
were recognised regardless of the amount of previous knowledge and experience. Such
opportunities were recognised through systematic search combined with active
networking and the use of weak network ties.
Knowledge is generally regarded as an important element of opportunity development
(Bai & Johanson, 2018). Knowledge is an established concept within internationalisation
literature in general, as it is considered to play a significant role in several
internationalisation theories, such as the network approach and Internationalisation
process theory (Sandberg, 2013). Eriksson et. al (1997) suggests that SMEs can have a
limited ability to recognise business opportunities due to limited experiential knowledge.
According to Johanson and Vahlne (2006), experiential knowledge tends to reduce
uncertainty associated with making commitments to a foreign market, meanwhile such
knowledge also functions as a framework for the recognition and development of
opportunities. The rationale is, that experiential knowledge gives absorptive capacity,
which in turn, is the ability to understand, interpret and evaluate new knowledge. Such
knowledge is accumulated over time through business operations (Hohenthal, et. al,
2014), and through interaction in business network relationships (Sandberg, 2013).
Internationalisation knowledge can be general in means of how to conduct business
internationally, or it could be market and customer -specific knowledge of a particular
foreign market (Sandberg, 2013). Market-specific knowledge refers to host country
market, in which the firm is operating or intends to operate. It includes knowledge of host
country laws, economy, market actors, competitors, culture, and society. As such, it

24

Minna Svenfelt

includes a versatile understanding of the market. This type of knowledge is particularly
beneficial for developing international opportunities (Lindstrand & Hånell, 2017). As
discussed by Johanson and Kao (2015), firms may not always have adequate market
knowledge when they pursue emerging markets. Such knowledge can also be challenging
to obtain as information is commonly not distributed freely in such markets.
Furthermore, there is some evidence that the entrepreneurial orientation of the firm
influence recognition and exploitation of opportunities among SMEs (Crick & Spence,
2005). Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) refers to strategy-making processes and styles
among firms that take part in entrepreneurial activities (Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). EO can
be sorted into five dimensions; 1) autonomy, 2) Innovativeness, 3) risk taking 4)
proactiveness and 5) competitive aggressiveness, which all affect a firm’s performance
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Autonomy refers to independent action undertaken to bring
forward a vision or business concept and accomplish it. Innovativeness in turn, is defined
by willingness to engage in creativity and experimentation to introduce new products,
services and develop new processes. Risk taking is the tendency to undertake daring
actions, such as venturing to new and unknown markets. Proactiveness refers to an
opportunity-seeking and forward-looking standpoint of the firm, and it involves the
introduction of new products/services, forecasting future demand, create change or to
work towards shaping one’s environment. Lastly, competitive aggressiveness is defined
by a firm’s attempts to outperform industry rivals, which is reflected by a certain readiness
and strong reaction towards the actions of competitors (Lumpkin & Dess, 2001). Chandra
et. al (2009) argue, that the greater EO an SME displays, the likelier it is for it to discover
opportunities in foreign markets. The authors further argue, that firm characteristic such
as EO in general, is beneficial to tackle uncertainties related to foreign market entry, while
a forward-looking tendency and openness to new ideas can facilitate the identification
and enactment of new foreign market opportunities.
As for the external determinants of international opportunity exploration and exploitation,
contributions have been made by for instance Kontinen and Ojala (2011) and
Blankenburg Holm et. al (2015), who reveal that a firm’s network position influences the
international opportunity development process. According to Blankenburg Holm et. al
(2015) a firm needs to develop its network position to get access to opportunities, and the
position in the network will influence the type of opportunities that can be recognised.

25

Minna Svenfelt

Kontinen & Ojalas (2011) study in turn, revealed that SMEs form new network ties
through which foreign market opportunities are recognised. In general, the role of
networks as an external influencing factor for opportunity exploration and exploitation is
well recognised (see e.g. Ellis, 2011; Kontinen & Ojala, 2011, Blankenburg Holm et. al,
2015). Next chapter will review the role of business network relationships for
international opportunity exploration and exploitation in more detail.

3.2 A Business Network Approach to Opportunity
Exploration and Exploitation
Business network relationships provide sources of ideas and knowledge that can be
developed into exploitable opportunities (Bai & Johanson, 2018). The importance of
business network relationships is brought forward particularly during opportunity
exploitation, due to the support that relationships can provide (Vasilchenko & Morris,
2011).

3.2.1 Business relationships
A relationship is a resource that can be exploited and combined with other resources
available to the firm. A firm can possess a range of resources, both tangible and
intangible. While business relationships restrict the operations a firm can undertake, they
also represent a possibility to achieve certain goals (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995). SMEs
have relationships with various actors that can include customers, suppliers, distributors,
competitors, non-profit organisations, public administration, government and so forth
(Ojala, 2009). Different types of network relationships can be categorised as formal,
informal, and intermediary. Generally, extant literature seems to conform to the idea that
formal relationships are connected to business activities and relations between at least
two business actors in the network, whereas informal relationships refer to social contacts
such as friends and family (Ojala 2009). It has been argued that formal relationships are
embedded within social ties, and as such, these relationships are essentially social
(Kontinen & Ojala 2011). Business relationships are first and foremost developed for
economic advantages. However, organizational behaviour is a result of the actions
undertaken by individuals representing the organisations. Consequently, social
relationships, i.e., ties between individuals, inevitably intervene in business processes
(Mainela, 2007).
26

Minna Svenfelt

Intermediary relationships are third party actors, that may facilitate the establishment of
a network relationship between a buyer and a seller (Ojala, 2009). Oviatt and McDougall
(2005) refer to these actors as ‘brokers’ that can establish connections between actors in
different markets, i.e., buyers and sellers, which may lead to new international business
activities between the parties. In conclusion, firms utilise different types of network
relationships as they pursue international markets, and these include formal, informal,
and intermediary relationships. (Ojala 2009).
It is well-known that firms establish relationships with other firms. These relationships
are often long-term (Johanson & Vahlne, 2006). Shared interest is a basic characteristic
of these relationships (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995), and firms will develop the
relationships they need to support their own operations (Håkansson & Ford, 2002).
Another basic characteristic of a business relationship is the mutual benefit gained by the
parties involved. The relationship is maintained and deepened provided that the firms
continue to benefit from each other (Johanson & Vahlne, 2006). Exchange, in means of
for instance; material, service and information - are also at the core of business network
relationships (Blankenburg Holm, Eriksson and Johanson, 1999) Relationships can be
initiated through systematic search, for instance when a firm search for a partner or a
supplier, or they may be an outcome of an ad-hoc event (Johanson & Vahlne, 2006), such
as an unplanned encounter (Chandra. et. al. 2017), that lead to repeated interaction
between the firms and eventually develop into a business relationship (Johanson &
Vahlne, 2006).

All firms have relationships with various actors in the market

(Blankenburg Holm et. al., 1999), and they continuously interact to create, develop, and
maintain their relationships with others. The interaction can have a long history, or it
could be more spontaneous in nature (Håkansson, et. al, 2009).

3.2.2 Business networks
In network literature, the term network is used in different ways to describe connections
between actors that can be individuals or organisations (Kontinen & Ojala, 2011). A
network is commonly viewed as a structure where nodes are connected to each other by
a set of threads. In the context of a business market, the nodes represent business units,
whereas the threads represent relationships between business units. Both the threads and
the nodes are ‘loaded’ with resources, knowledge and understanding. This is the outcome
of interactions within and between firms over the course of time (Håkansson & Ford,

27

Minna Svenfelt

2002). The relationships in a business market are connected. A direct connection is the
relationship between e.g., a supplier and a customer, which can be labelled as a dyad
(Andersson et. al, 1994). As all firms are part of a network, a change in the relationship
between two firms will also affect other actors in the network (Andersson et al, 1994). In
this sense, all firms are part of a larger entity and the direct relationship between two
actors contribute to the indirect relation between other actors (Håkansson & Snehota,
1995). In this respect, business relationships can be indirectly connected to some other
business relationships. This implicates that there are no objective borders in business
networks. The network boundaries are based on the views of network actors or outside
observers (Hohenthal et. al, 2014).
Network positioning and business relationships are connected. Relationships are
embedded in networks. Embeddedness can be further divided into structural and
relational embeddedness. Simply put, the former concerns “whom one knows”, while the
latter relates to “how well one knows them”. Structural embeddedness highlights the
advantages the firm can gain from its position in the business network, while relational
embeddedness concerns the benefit of learning and the exchange of information in close
relationships (Forsgren, 2016). How the firm positions itself in the network, i.e., a firm’s
networks position, is determined by the relationships it has with other actors in the
network (Halinen & Törnroos, 1998). The position also reflects the trustworthiness and
degree of commitment of firms in the relationship network (Schweizer et al. 2010;
Blankenburg Holm et. al, 2015). A firm will not always be positioned in the most
beneficial way in relation to other network actors. By striving to develop its network
position, a firm can gain more influence on what occurs in the network as well as extended
circle of the network (Håkansson & Ford, 2002). Having an insider position is beneficial,
since it enables the SME to obtain exclusive information that can lead to new
opportunities (Blankenburg Holm et al, 2015).
Related to the concept of structural embeddedness is the discussion on the benefits of
open vs. closed networks for opportunity identification (Bai & Johanson, 2018). Open
networks are associated with diverse information supply (Forsgren, 2016). Such networks
can facilitate the recognition of opportunities in foreign markets (Moran, 2005). The
rationale is, that open networks, can provide more information about opportunities due to
structural holes. Closed networks on the other hand, tend to facilitate the development of

28

Minna Svenfelt

an opportunity. The underlying argument is that closed networks make knowledge
transfer easier and reduce a firm’s risk associated with knowledge exchange, due to the
support of social capital in such networks (Forsgren, 2016).
Business networks can be described to involve actors, activities, and resources
(Andersson et. al, 1994). Actors perform activities and control/access resources within a
specific field. (Håkansson, 1987). As actors direct attention and express interest towards
each other they become committed and form actor bonds. The bonds influence how the
actors interpret situations and how they form their identities in relation to each other and
other network actors. Activities occur as actors combine, develop or exchange resources.
The relationship between firms will affect how they carry out activities. As companies
form relationships, some of their activities (e.g. technical, administrative, and
commercial) can become linked in different ways (Håkansson & Snehota, 1995). To
engage in activities, network actors require resources. Resources can include e.g.
physical, financial, and human resources. Technical, commercial, or administrative
know-how can also be of interest in a relationship between two firms. In a relationship,
the resources of two firms (actors) can be tied together to form resource ties. The
expectation to access a variety of resources from one another is a common feature of
business relationships. The degree and type of resource ties may vary. As a relationship
develops, new resource combinations are likely to emerge (Håkansson & Snehota 1995)

3.2.3 A business network approach to SME internationalisation
It is well-established that network relationships facilitate foreign market entry (Johanson
& Vahlne, 2003). Several studies have emphasised the role of networks specifically in
the case of internationalising SMEs (see e.g., Chetty & Blankenburg-Holm, 2000;
Coviello & Munro, 1997; Ojala 2009). Business network relationships can facilitate
acquisition of experiential knowledge of foreign markets (Vasilchenko & Morris, 2011).
Networks have also been found to assist SMEs in means of ease and speed of
internationalisation (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005). Moreover, network relationships tend
to influence the choice of entry mode and the decision on which markets to enter (Coviello
& Munro 1995; 1997). Furthermore, networks have been found to facilitate
internationalisation by providing support in the search for opportunities and potential
business partners in foreign markets (Ojala 2009; O’Gorman & Evers, 2011). For the
resource constrained SME, the network approach to internationalisation is especially

29

Minna Svenfelt

highlighted, since the network can provide an alternative way of accessing resources
needed for internationalisation that the smaller firm may not have on its own (Hilmersson
& Papaioannou 2015). Particularly in the case of Finnish cleantech SMEs, insufficient
resources and lack of market knowledge have constituted challenges during
internationalisation (Saarenketo et. al, 2018). The network view on internationalisation is
also considered significant for entries into emerging markets (Meyer & Skak, 2000). To
obtain knowledge of such markets and pursue market opportunities the firm need to utilise
their relationships with other network actors (Fiedler et. al, 2017). In conclusion, network
relationships are important for internationalising SMEs due the support that they can
provide in means of overcoming risks and obstacles associated with foreign market entry
(Johanson & Vahlne, 2003; Musteen, Francis & Datta, 2010).
The network theory has gained popularity in explaining how firms internationalise
(Hilmersson & Papaioannou, 2015). The strength of the network approach is within its
ability to explain the internationalisation process. In addition, it is an useful perspective
for enlightening how actors, activities and resources within the network influence
different dimensions of a firm’s entry into international markets (Loane & Bell, 2006).
The network perspective is based on the idea that the internationalisation of firms depends
more upon the relationships it has with other network actors, than on firm-specific
advantages and the culture or attributes of the target markets (Coviello & McAuley,
1999). In their Network internationalisation model, Johanson & Matsson (1988) stress
the importance of a firm’s network position during internationalisation (Chetty &
Blankenburg Holm, 2000). Firms internationalise through developing their network
positions by networking with other actors through both formal and informal relationships,
or by forming new network ties (Chandra, 2017). Unplanned effects of these interactions
and relationships can facilitate the internationalisation process of a firm. (Chandra, 2017).
The network view further entails, that the activities taking place in the network enables a
firm to form relationships, that can help provide access to resources and markets. The
reasoning is that firms need resources controlled by other firms in the network and
resources can be acquired through its network positions (Chetty & Blankenburg Holm,
2000). Firms aim to combine their own competence and resources in new ways with those
of others. In the context of internationalisation this entails combining resources with
business partners and creating relationships to eventually become a network insider
(Blankenburg Holm et. al, 2015).

3.2.4 A business network approach to international opportunity
exploration and exploitation
The international perspective on opportunities implicates that an opportunity is
discovered in a foreign market, where after it is exploited by utilising various resources,
that can stem from multiple national locations (Kontinen & Ojala, 2011) and networks
(e.g. Hånell & Ghauri, 2016; Chetty and Blankenburg Holm, 2000; Coviello and Munro,
1995). Compared to their larger counterparts, SMEs generally rely more on their business
network relationships when pursuing international opportunities. This is due to the
support network relationships can provide for the development of an international
opportunity (Coviello, 2006). Relationships can facilitate the process through external
resources that the internationalising firm may find difficult to obtain on its own (Juho,
2011).
Opportunities are identified and exploited through business network relationships
(Blankenburg Holm et. al, 2015), and interaction in business relationships facilitate the
development of international opportunities (Forsgren, 2016). From a business network
perspective, Ghauri, Hadjikhani and Johanson (2005) suggest that opportunities arise as
result of privileged knowledge shared and developed among firms in their interactions
with each other. Knowledge is important to enable recognition of opportunities in foreign
markets. (Johanson & Vahlne, 2009). As a result, the development of an international
opportunity in a network context can be viewed as process where network actors in
interaction with each other combine a myriad of knowledge and resources (Hånell &
Ghauri, 2016).
In general, network research emphasises inter-firm ties for learning as well as obtaining
and utilising knowledge. Ties between firms are both the motivation and channel for
sharing different types of knowledge (Sharma & Blomstermo, 2003). In fact, business
development activities such as internationalisation and opportunity development, have
been described as a matter of learning (Juho, 2011). When two firms are committed to
conduct business with each other, they also have a basis from which they can both learn
from and about each other. Meanwhile, they also have a basis for creating new knowledge
through interaction. In this sense, opportunities for new business in international markets
can be developed or derived from interaction in the business network. Since each firm is
part of a larger network of relationships, the focal firm will also be indirectly connected

31

Minna Svenfelt

to a wider network of interconnected firms, resulting into some extent, a shared
knowledge capital (Johanson & Vahlne, 2006). Fletcher (2007) identifies particularly
three types of knowledge that are of significance when small firms undertake international
business activities: 1) market knowledge, 2) internationalisation knowledge and 3)
product/technological knowledge. Such knowledge can be gained through business
networks (Sandberg, 2013), and by obtaining such knowledge a firm can proceed with its
internationalisation (Juho, 2011).
Ellis (2011) argues that the advantages network relationships provide in means of
international opportunity exploration and exploitation are mostly informational. Firms
can use their relationships to accumulate different types of information that facilitate their
entry into new international markets (Ellis, 2011). Such information also tends to be
perceived as more credible due to trust inherent in relationships (Zahra et. al. 2005).
Relationships can also be a source of unexpected and random information that can lead
to exploration of new opportunities (Sharma & Blomstermo, 2003). Information that
facilitate the exploration and exploitation of opportunities in foreign markets can be
related to, for instance, information about market gaps or insight into current product
demands (Söderqvist, 2011). Relationships can further facilitate the international
opportunity process by providing complementing skills, access to networks, potential
buyers/retailers as well as different types of knowledge, such as market-, technical and
internationalisation knowledge. The support provided by other firms in the network can
also be of more tangible nature, such as access to facilities, equipment or material needed
for developing the international opportunity further (Söderqvist, 2011). In this sense,
business network relationships can provide a variety of the experience and knowledge
needed to explore and exploit opportunities in foreign markets (Johanson & Vahlne,
2011).
SMEs develop the relationships they need to pursue opportunities in foreign markets.
(Kontinen & Ojala, 2011). Kontinen and Ojala (2011) studied the role of network ties for
international opportunity recognition among Finnish SMEs aiming to extend their
business operations to France. The authors concluded that the firms tended to recognise
international opportunities through new network ties, which were mainly formed at
international trade exhibitions. Already existing and informal network ties, such as family
members and employees, did not generally facilitate the recognition of opportunities. This

32

Minna Svenfelt

is a contrast to the study of knowledge intensive SMEs by eg. Bell (1995), where it was
found that existing relationships had a more significant role, as the firms followed their
established network relations into new markets. Kontinen and Ojala (2011) propose that
trade exhibitions provide SMEs a suitable environment to form network ties, which may
lead to new international opportunities.

They further advocate the use of export-

promotion organisations to assist in mediating relationships between SMEs and potential
foreign distributors or customers. Another study stressing the significance of exportpromotion organisations is a study by Ojala (2009). Ojala (2009) studied Finnish SMEs
internationalising to Japan. The findings show that the SMEs developed networks with
non-profit export-promotion organisations in the home and/or host country, to enable
them to network with potential distributors for entry into the target market. In this sense,
the mediated relationships opened the way to the target market and provided the firms
with further access to network with potential customers and distributors.
Blankenburg-Holm et. al (2015) studied opportunities from a network position
perspective through the effects of outsidership vs. insidership on opportunity recognition
and exploitation during internationalisation. The authors argue that in a network context,
opportunity development occurs through recognition and exploitation. They further argue
that exploitation, for its most part, concerns the development of business relationships in
the foreign market. This is done to develop network position and eventually gain
insidership. The network position lays the foundation for which opportunities can be
recognised by the firm; only those opportunities that are visible from the current position
in the business network can be recognised. They further argue that there is a path
dependence between recognition and exploitation. This means, that only recognised
opportunities can be exploited, and these opportunities are in turn the outcome of the
opportunities the firm has already exploited.
SMEs use different types of relationships to pursue opportunities in foreign markets
(Ojala, 2009). Some of the network actors that will influence the process will be
competitors (Hohenthal et. al, 2014). Kock et al (2010) found that co-opetitive
relationships were a source of international opportunities among Finnish SMEs. The
authors reported that co-opetitive relationships provided the firms access to established
distribution networks in foreign markets and new international contacts. The studied
SMEs also engaged in knowledge and information exchange, ranging from more general

33

Minna Svenfelt

knowledge on business development to more specific matters to increase efficiency.
Customer inquiries were also shared among the firms in cases where one firm was not
able to handle the inquiry itself, and thus providing the competitor a chance to obtain
references and contacts in a new foreign market. Furthermore, the speed of
internationalisation was increased, along with reduced costs related to the
internationalisation process and the development of the international network.

3.2.5 Relationship drawbacks
Network relationships are not solely a benefit for international opportunity exploration
and exploitation (Ellis, 2011). Still, few studies direct attention towards the disadvantages
of network relationships during the process. Since a firm’s relationships influence the
process of international opportunity development, consideration should also be directed
towards the potential drawbacks of using network relationships as a conduit for foreign
market opportunities (Ellis, 2011).
The use of networks to pursue international markets has its limits in means of information
exchange, since the extent to which information is shared in networks can be limited
(Kenny & Fahy, 2011). Lindstrand and Hånell (2017) highlight that exploring
opportunities through networks may either lead to positive consequences through the
stream of information and subsequent opportunity exploitation, or to constraining effects
due to scarce flow of information and resources available among a firm’s extant network
ties. Depending on the quality of exchange in the network relationships, more or less
opportunities will be identified and exploited. Söderqvist (2011) points out that although
the firm may already have relationships that could be useful for international opportunity
development, or even if it manages to develop new ones for this purpose, it can take time
to learn how to gain advantages from those relationships and the resources they could
offer. Thus, relationships provide limited advantages if the firm cannot find ways to
benefit from them.
Relationships can create restrictions, for instance by limiting a firm’s plans for
development and change. No company operates in isolation from others, and if it seeks
change in one way or another, the changes will affect other actors in the network,
including the firms it has direct relationships with. This implicates, that the firm can
become dependent on the approval and help of others to realise its own aspirations

34

Minna Svenfelt

(Håkansson & Ford, 2002). Power and control issues exist in network relationships,
meaning that it is not certain that a company will gain support from its relationships when
developing certain opportunities (Coviello & Munro, 1995). In addition, a company can
become too dependent on its current network relations (Kock et. al. 2010), which in turn,
can limit its own actions (Juho, 2011). Dependence on a certain relationship can, for
instance, lead to consequences in means of establishing new relationships or pursuing
business opportunities outside the network (Coviello & Munro, 1995). Sullivan Mort and
Weerawardena (2006) refer to these negative aspects as “network rigidity”. This means
that the involvement in networks can limit a firm’s strategic options, since opportunities
may need to be developed within the network boundaries.
The drawbacks of relationships can further be related to deception in negotiations, broken
promises, or passiveness when support could be expected from the other party. This could
occur although the relationship is perceived trustworthy (Söderqvist, 2011). In a study on
international opportunity recognition and exploitation among Finnish Wood-Mill SMEs,
the drawbacks of network relationships were related to the occurrence of mutual grudge
developing between firms. This was the case in such opportunities that did not offer
enough business for all of the involved. This led some of the studied firms to consider
limiting excessive dependency on network relationships as a source of international
opportunities (Hietala, Hänninen, Kniivilä and Toppinen, 2019).

3.2.6 Summary
In the following the literature review is briefly summarised into a conceptual model to
guide the data collection and subsequent data analysis. The framework functions as
summary of the main concepts discussed and the ways that these are interlinked (see
figure 2)

35

Minna Svenfelt

Figure 2: A Conceptual model of international opportunity exploration and exploitation in SMEs.

The development of an international opportunity occurs through the phases of exploration
and exploitation. These phases are intertwined, rather than separate or completely
distinctive. The arrows visible between opportunity exploration and opportunity
exploitation has been created in an attempt to reflect this. Opportunity exploration refers
to the circumstances under which the ‘idea’ of an opportunity in the foreign market
emerge. Exploitation on the other hand, concerns the activities undertaken by the firm to
transform the opportunity into something of value. Exploitation activities are manifold
and related to the refinement and implementation of the identified opportunity, which will
eventually lead to initiation of international exchange with a new partner in a new foreign
market. The process is continuous, and the opportunity can be subject to changes as time
unfolds. Further, the process is influenced by the firm’s international experience and prior
knowledge. Due to the firm being a part of a larger entity – the business network – other
actors in the network will influence the opportunity exploration and exploitation activities
undertaken by the SME. These business network actors can include e.g., individuals,
departments, competitors, suppliers, distributors, and government institutions. Through
interaction and exchange of resources within business network relationships the firm is
gradually developing the international opportunity towards realisation. During this
process, the firm is likely to experience both advantages and constraints from its
relationships with other business network actors.

36

Minna Svenfelt

In contrast to the opportunity formation model by Ardichivili et. al. (2003) presented in
chapter 3.1.2, this model focuses on influence of business network relationships rather
than social networks. This model is constructed to reflect the process in the context of an
international opportunity. This was not particularly the intention in the model created by
Ardichivili et. al (2003). In addition, the model developed for this thesis leaves out
influencing factors such as personal characteristics and entrepreneurial alertness, as this
study is conducted from an SME perspective and does not intend to investigate such
aspects. Yet, influencing factors such as international experience and prior knowledge
has been included, as the literature review implicate that these factors influence
international opportunity development among SMEs.

4 METHODOLOGY
This chapter presents the research methodology, including a description of the research
strategy, research design, data collection process and a description of how data was
analysed. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the trustworthiness of the study.

4.1 Research strategy
It is common to make a distinction between qualitative and quantitative research. The
distinction is often described by emphasising that quantitative research focuses on
quantification in the collection and analysis of data, while a qualitative research strategy
tends to emphasise words (Bryman & Bell, 2011). When conducting qualitative
organizational research, the researcher seeks to gather interpretations that organizational
actors give to different occurrences in organizational life, with an emphasis on the
nuances that appear through them (Strati, 2000, p.134). This thesis adopts a qualitative
research strategy and utilises qualitative methods of research, in the form of in-depth
semi-structured interviews. A qualitative method was chosen due to the exploratory
nature of this thesis, i.e., the aim to understand how Finnish cleantech SMEs explore and
exploit international opportunities, and the influence of business network relationships
during the process. To achieve an in-depth understanding of this topic, it was deemed
sensible to apply a qualitative method.
There are multiple approaches to conducting interviews and these can be categorised as
structured, semi-structured and unstructured interviews. A semi-structured interview
usually refers to a situation where a range of questions has been prepared in the form of
an interview guide. In the semi-structured interview, the order of questions can be
rearranged, and the interviewer may ask further questions as a response to notable replies.
Furthermore, the questions can be slightly more general compared to the structured
interview (Bryman & Bell, 2011). The semi-structured approach was chosen to allow for
small adjustments to be made to the questions and the order in which questions were
asked. In addition, the intent was to enable a discussion with the interviewees and allow
the respondents to express themselves openly on the subject, which could facilitate a more
in-depth understanding of the studied topic.

38

4.2 Research design
A research design functions as a framework for the collection and analysis of data. It
guides decisions and priority given to certain elements in the research process (Bryman
& Bell, 2011). This study applies a multiple case study design. One of the benefits using
the case study design, is the choice to use a single or multiple cases (Yin, 1989).
Depending on the context being studied, both variations have their own advantages.
According to Bryman and Bell (2011), multiple cases enable the researcher to compare
findings from each case and it is an extension of the single-case study design. By focusing
on three cases in this study, it allows for differences and similarities between each case
to be identified. Here, the use of a multiple-case focus is also assumed to facilitate a richer
view of the studied phenomenon.
A case study approach is suitable when one intends to study a topic or phenomenon indepth, while involving just one or a few units of study. Moreover, the case study approach
allows for a phenomenon to be studied in its context, where the findings provide insights
on how the phenomenon unfolds in a given situation (Farquhar, 2012). In case study
research, emphasis is directed towards the creation of detailed and holistic knowledge,
based on the analysis of several empirical sources. The approach has gained popularity in
business studies due to its ability to demonstrate complicated issues in an accessible,
vivid, and sensible form. This ‘real-life’ aspect of case study research has also evoked
criticism; case studies are sometimes regarded as anecdotal descriptions lacking scientific
accuracy (Eriksson & Kovalainen, 2008). A case study approach is suitable for answering
research questions concerning how, who and why (Farquhar, 2012). Furthermore, it is a
sensible approach when addressing complex organizational, managerial, or other business
issues, that would be difficult to study through quantitative methods (Eriksson &
Kovalainen, 2008).

4.2.1 Case selection
This thesis adopts a purposive sampling method. Purposive sampling entails that the
researcher selects research participants according to his/her own judgement to find
suitable respondents that fit the purpose of the study. This method can be used in e.g. case
study research, when one intends to study only a few cases (Saunders, Lewis, and
Thornhill, 2009). Potential case firms were searched for and selected according to certain

39

Minna Svenfelt

criteria. The criteria were as follows; 1) Firms had to be small or middle-sized enterprises
based in Finland, 2) Selected SMEs were to have initiated business operations in the
Indian market 3) Selected SMEs where to fit the definition of a “cleantech company”, as
defined in this thesis.
Potential case companies were searched for on the internet and identified through the
websites of Business Finland (www.businessfinland.fi). A background check was made
on each company to determine whether they fulfilled the criteria for case selection.
Initially, five potential case firms were contacted via email and/or by phone to explain
the purpose of the study, present the criteria for selecting case companies, and to request
their participation in an interview. Three firms expressed their interest in taking part in
the study. Interviews were scheduled with representatives from each of the three case
firms. All interviewees were in manager positions and had active roles in the firms’
business operations in India. The respondents were further assured that their names, as
well company names, would not have to be disclosed in the study. In one of the cases, it
was not possible to interview the managers that had been personally involved in the
decision to pursue the first Indian market opportunity. To assure as accurate answers as
possible from this respondent, the interview guide was sent to the respondent in advance.
The respondent consulted with the managers who were involved in the opportunity
exploration and exploitation process in the early 2000s, to sort out the questions the
respondent himself was not fully acquainted with.

4.2.2 Data collection process and data analysis
Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with a representative from each
case company. An interview guide was developed in line with the conceptual framework
and the theoretical focus of the study. All interviews were conducted remotely via an
online platform for video conferencing. Each interview was recorded on permission from
the respondent.
The interviews were the main source of information during the data collection process.
According to Yin (2018), it is recommendable to use multiple sources of information to
improve the research. Such sources can include both primary and secondary sources. By
utilising multiple data collection methods or different data sources, research findings are
strengthened since the evidence is triangulated. (Farquhar, 2012).

In addition to

40

Minna Svenfelt

interviews, this study utilised secondary data sources to complement the data gathered
through interviews. Secondary data sources consisted of information about the case firms
collected through publicly available information on the internet and the company
websites. The interviews were conducted in November and December 2020, and the
length of each interview was approximately one hour. Prior to the interviews, a summary
of the interview topic was sent to each respondent. This was partly done upon request
from two of the respondents, but also to let the respondents familiarize themselves with
the subject of the interview. All interviews were held in English to avoid possible
mistranslations of the interview questions or the gathered data. All respondents expressed
that they were comfortable with the choice of language. The concepts and terms used in
the interviews were also explained to the respondents when necessary. Shortly after the
interviews each interview was transcribed to facilitate subsequent data analysis.
Summaries of the interview transcripts were sent to the respondents to give them a chance
to comment the findings.
Due to the small number of cases, data was analysed manually without the support of
programs specifically intended for conducting data analysis. To some extent, the data was
analysed already during the data collection phase by taking notes during and after each
interview.

However, the main analysis took place after each interview had been

transcribed by applying a thematic analysis method. Neuendorf (2019) describes thematic
analysis as a method for identifying patterns in a dataset. The process typically includes
that one familiarises with the dataset, such as an interview transcript, and identifies
aspects of interest. Thereafter, the researcher creates codes to identify important features
in the data. Codes are applied to those aspects that are relevant for answering the research
questions. The codes may then be reviewed to identify themes and enable patterns of
meaning to be discovered. The themes are then reviewed, defined, and weaved in to a
report, or a story, that includes an analysis of each theme (Neuendorf, 2019).
Thematic analysis has been described as a flexible approach to analysing data, that can
be adjusted to fit the needs of different studies. It can be a useful approach particularly
for those new to conducting research, as it includes few procedures, and does not require
specific technical and theoretical knowledge of other qualitative approaches. It allows
for an investigation of different perspectives among respondents, identification of
similarities and differences, and to summarize key aspects even from larger data sets to

41

Minna Svenfelt

produce interesting insights (Nowell et. al. 2017, p.2). As the analysis was undertaken,
the conceptual model presented in chapter 3.2.6 was also utilised to define the themes to
be analysed.

4.3 Trustworthiness of the study
Reliability and validity are important criteria for the evaluation of research. While
reliability refers to whether results of a study are repeatable, validity is related to the
integrity of the conclusions developed from research (Bryman & Bell, 2011). It has been
questioned whether the concepts of validity and reliability are suitable for evaluating
qualitative research, and whether other terms could be used (Sinkovics, Penz and Ghauri,
2008). Assessing the trustworthiness of a study is thus an alternative way of evaluating
a qualitative study. Trustworthiness can be categorised into different aspects: credibility,
transferability, dependability, and confirmability. These aspects have a parallel with the
criteria for evaluating quantitative research (Bryman & Bell, 2011). Next, the
trustworthiness of this study will be discussed in accordance with the before mentioned
aspects of trustworthiness.
Credibility refers to whether the findings of the study are convincing (Bryman & Bell,
2011). It involves proper collection and interpretation of data, so that the findings and the
conclusions reflect and represent what has been studied (Yin, 2016). In order to enhance
the creditability of this study, summaries of the main findings from the interviews were
sent to respondents for verification and comments. This allowed the respondents to make
additions and clarifying comments if deemed necessary. The data gathered through
interviews was also compared with information available on company websites, such as
articles and case studies that in means of content matched the subject of this study.
Transferability concerns whether the findings of the study apply to other contexts. It is
concerned with whether the results are generalisable beyond the study’s particular
research context (Bryman & Bell, 2011). In qualitative studies, this concerns
transferability from one case to another. Therefore, the researcher must aim to provide
readers with thick descriptions of the findings, so that the readers and those seeking to
transfer the findings can judge transferability (Nowell et. al, 2017).

42

Minna Svenfelt

Dependability can be regarded as a parallel to reliability in quantitative research. Ensuring
that this criterion is met entails that the researcher applies an auditing approach. This
involves preserving documents of the entire research process, such as the research plan,
interview transcripts, selection of research participants, fieldwork notes etc. Such
documents serve as proof that appropriate procedures have been followed (Bryman &
Bell, 2011). In means of obtaining dependability, the intention has been to describe the
different phases of the research process thoroughly. Other documentation related to this
study, such as information related to topic selection, research plan, inquiry to case
companies to participate in the study, and interview transcripts have been saved.
Furthermore, the interview guide has been added in Appendix 1 to provide readers an
overview of the interview questions.
Confirmability entails that the researcher acts in good faith. While full objectivity is
unachievable in business research, it should be apparent that the researcher has not
allowed personal values or theoretical preferences to steer the course of the research and
the findings deriving from it (Bryman & Bell 2011, p. 398). Throughout this study, the
aim has been to apply the most suitable methods to conduct the research and conform
with good academic practices. As discussed, summaries of interview transcripts were sent
to respondents to verify the data. In this sense, all respondents were given the chance to
comment the interpretations of the data if deemed necessary. The information collected
through interviews were also compared to information found on the internet (e.g. case
company websites, company reports, case studies on company websites).

5 EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
This chapter presents the interview results. First, each case company will be briefly
presented, whereafter the interview data is presented under thematic subheadings.

5.1 Case descriptions
Case Company A was established in the 1960’s and specialises in solutions for the
concrete industry. The company provides heating and cooling solutions for concrete
production. Their solutions are intended for ready-mix concrete producers as well as
producers of precast concrete, pipes, blocks and pavers. The company offers total
solutions including process design and sizing of equipment and systems, equipment
delivery, installation and implementation of fully functional systems, as well as
precautionary maintenance and technical services. The company is best known for its
innovative heating solutions that typically allows one to use 60-80% less fuel than in any
other heating solution, which makes it an environmentally friendly option. The goal is to
help their customers to produce better quality concrete. The main office and factory are
located in Finland, where all products are manufactured and assembled for customers
around the globe. The company has a fully owned subsidiary in USA, an associate
company in Sweden and a representative office in Russia. The first opportunity in the
Indian market evolved in 2010, as Company A was contacted by a German company
operating in the construction industry, with an inquiry to take part in a project near the
Himalayas, India. They asked Company A to supply a heating solution to the tunnelling
project in India.
Case Company B was established in 1995 and specialises in developing, manufacturing
and marketing of multipurpose dredgers. The machines are used to prevent floods,
remove harmful vegetation, polluted sediments and waste, as well as for construction and
restoration of shallow water ways and shores. The key aspect of the machine is that it can
be applied to perform multiple tasks in shallow water areas. Its multiple functions provide
solutions for keeping water resources clean. For Company B, the opportunity in India
emerged in early 2000’s, as the two brothers who run the company at the time started to
purchase registers of dredging companies in foreign markets, including India. Eventually,

44

they found a local partner in India, a dredging company, to support them in selling the
first machine in the Indian market.
Case Company C has over 25 years of experience in designing, manufacturing and selling
aerosol and fine particle measurement solutions and instruments intended for a variety of
environments and purposes. All products are developed and manufactured in Finland and
are almost exclusively used for research and development purposes. The customer base
consists of private companies, universities and research institutes that are conducting
work on a variety of aerosol related issues. The measuring instruments are purchased for
the purpose of conducting e.g., Health-effect and air-quality studies. Besides universities
and research institutes, the instruments are used among e.g., automotive manufacturers
and electronic cigarette companies. The company was international almost immediately
after its inception, and started early on to develop a distributor network to support
international sales activities. The company actively participates in conferences.
Participating and presenting at such events have provided opportunities to meet potential
customers all around the world. The company’s first international operations where
conducted as instrument sales to Japan and the UK. The first opportunity in India emerged
in 2003, when the company took part in a conference, were company representatives got
in contact with a potential customer in India interested in purchasing their instruments.

5.2 Opportunity exploration
This sub-chapter presents the findings concerning the circumstances that led case
companies to identify their first opportunities in the Indian market. In two of the cases
there were no particular interest in serving the Indian market prior to opportunity
recognition. For these companies the interest in the market grew as they familiarised with
potential idea of pursuing the market. Common among the cases is that at the time, all
companies were seeking growth opportunities in new foreign markets.
In the case of Company A, the opportunity to engage with the Indian market emerged as
the company was contacted by a construction company with an inquiry to take part in a
tunnelling project near the Himalayas, India. The respondent finds that the opportunity
emerged out of happenstance. The respondent for Company A describes the
circumstances in the following way:

45

Minna Svenfelt

“Quite frankly, I have to be honest with you. We ended up in India by accident. We had
a German partner, a huge construction company, called X. They actually asked if we
could supply our heating solution, which they had known already in the European market,
and felt that it would be a good fit.” – CEO, Company A
Company A was familiar with the construction company since before, as they had been
working side-by-side in other projects in European markets. The construction company
had formed a joint venture with a local construction company in India, and they were in
need of a heating solution to the tunnelling project. According to the respondent, the
company had been on the lookout for new international opportunities. They had
considered the potential of the Indian market, but at the time they did not have any serious
intentions to pursue business in India:
“We were looking for growth and we knew that for us the way to grow was to grow
abroad. We had pretty much exploited the Finnish market by then and the opportunities
would be in export for sure. India was not one of our target markets, but once the
opportunity came, we were eager to study the potential. Because obviously it is a huge
market and we decided that even though there were certain risks, we would take the risk
and go for the market.” – CEO, Company A
As for Company B, the company had in its early years been purchasing registers of
dredging companies and contractors in foreign markets as a first step to pursue business
in international markets. In this sense, they were ‘scanning’ the environment and were
looking for something new. However, they were not specifically focused on India. The
respondent finds that when it comes to their multipurpose dredging machine, there is a
certain need for it in every country. Thus, they see it as opportunities can be found and
exploited almost anywhere. During the early 2000’s, the company managers contacted
some of the companies in the registers to awaken interest in their product. Eventually,
they were contacted by an Indian working in Finland for the time being. He was offering
Finnish firms services to acquire industry contacts in India. Company B was provided
with a list of potential contacts, and set out to contact a few companies of interest.
Eventually, they managed to establish contact with a dredging company in India. After a
while of communicating and exchanging information with the Indian company, Company
B felt that the relationship appeared promising and could eventually lead to a sale. It was
decided that they would take further action to develop the opportunity.

Company C started early on to develop their distributor network to serve international
markets. To find new potential customers, the company actively participated in
professional forums and conferences with participants around the world. According to the
respondent, participation in conferences is particularly important in their field of business,
as they serve a niche and scientific market. International conferences gives the company
the opportunity to meet people all over the world. By participating in such events, they
knew that there was a certain demand for their products in India. For Company C, the
first opportunity in India evolved as research scientists from India had seen Company C’s
measuring instruments at a conference and were interested in purchasing the products.
Company C acknowledged the opportunity at hand, and set out to find an intermediate to
support them in the sales process. It was crucial to find an intermediate, as making sales
directly to a customer in India turned out to be very difficult due to bureaucracy and the
complexity of paper work.
“We didn’t really look for an opportunity – we got contacted directly by the potential
customer in India. And then we moved on to find an intermediary, or the distributor there,
to work the case in India.”- Vice President and Sales director, Company C
The respondent for Company C further finds that the company was not prepared for the
Indian market opportunity at the time due to lack of resources, but at as a small company
they were more or less chasing every potential sale. The turnover from a single sale was
fairly large. Even in the case of a ‘single sales opportunity’ they usually considered it to
be worth the while to make efforts and close the deal. As they were approached by the
potential customer in India, a large automotive research institute, they also recognised the
potential of acquiring more customers in the Indian market due to the good reputation of
their first potential customer. Around the same point in time the company was entering
the Chinese market and the idea was to approach the Indian market in a similar manner.
In China, the company had managed to get their instruments into the top universities. This
again, brought them sales from a range of other universities across China, as the
universities were monitoring what the top universities were doing and wanted to replicate.

5.3 Opportunity exploitation
This section presents the findings on opportunity exploitation, i.e., the type of activities
the companies engaged in to develop the opportunities into new international exchange.
47

Minna Svenfelt

A reoccurring topic in relation to opportunity exploitation was the importance of finding
intermediates and trustworthy local partners to support the international opportunity
development process. An exception to the search for a suitable local partner was
Company A, as the nature of their opportunity was somewhat different compared to the
other cases. Company A was directly contacted by the German construction company and
their joint venture partner in India with an inquiry to support them in a project. The
relationship with these two companies became the most important ones for opportunity
realisation. Thus, Company A did not spend much time on developing new contacts in
the market, and they find that the international opportunity development process was
fairly straight forward with few obstacles along the road.
The importance of finding intermediates and local partners partly derived from the
difficulty to sell directly from Finland to the end customer in India. Furthermore, the local
partners were the ones used to acquire the most detailed knowledge about the Indian
market. The respondent for Company B expressed his views regarding local partners in
the following manner:
“The key issue is to find the correct people in India. You have to have good local partners,
who can identify who are the actual decision makers that we should contact. Then it´s
also crucial that we travel from Finland as a representative from factory, to convince
them that we are interested and ready to supply” – Vice President of Sales, Company B
For Company B, the opportunity started to develop as the Company managed to establish
a new contact in India with a local dredging company that were in interested in Company
B’s product and willing to collaborate in order to sell the first machine in India. After a
while of information exchange between the two parties, one of the managers in Company
B decided to travel to India for a couple of weeks to meet the new partner and potential
end customers. In fact, in all cases it was decided early on that it was necessary to have
company representatives travel to India. Visits to the target market was seen as a
necessary mean for opportunity development. During the trips, the case companies
focused on meeting end customers, potential distributors and partners, gathered
information about the market, discussed with locals to become acquainted with the
culture, negotiated agreements/contracts, and arranged product related training or service.
Spending time on-site was seen as crucial for learning about the culture and local way of
doing business. Also, it enabled the companies to respond in a quick manner to product

48

Minna Svenfelt

related inquiries. The respondent for company C finds that it would have been necessary
to spend more time on-site and expressed his views as follows:
“..If there would have been one thing that would have helped us in the beginning more
quickly with the Indian market, it would have definitely have been to spend more time
there. Travelling there more and doing different sales and marketing activities with the
local contacts there. That would have helped, if we would have had the resources at the
time.”- Vice President and Sales Director, Company C
All case companies conducted market research during opportunity exploitation, albeit in
varying degrees. While some mainly trusted earlier knowledge gained through operating
in other foreign markets, others spent more time on consulting with other network actors,
such as competitors, distributors, and export promotion agencies, the chamber of
commerce and other companies operating more or less in the same field. In all three
cases, export and trade promotion agencies such Finnvera and Business Finland (former
Finpro) were consulted with to gain knowledge about the local market conditions; what
to expect when doing business in India, guidance concerning regulatory requirements and
finding contacts in the target market, and making sure that the banks that the case
company were using could work with the banks in India. Further, the companies needed
support in handling paper work. It was expressed that doing business in this market
produces an immense amount of paper work that can be difficult to deal with as a small
company.
Another topic brought up during the interviews, was the importance of making sure that
product related legislations and certain product standards were met. Being able to meet
international product standards was a benefit that indicated better chance of actually
getting the product into the market. In two of the cases, the product itself and product
related documents had to be modified to fit the conditions and requirements of the Indian
market. For instance, Company A’s product was going to operate in high altitudes.
Company A studied the geographical conditions, and realised that the external conditions
would set certain demands on modifying their product. For instance, they had to re-size
compressors so that they would be able to provide the power needed. In addition, some
electrical components were modified to function in more demanding conditions. They
set out to investigate the local legislation as far as heating solutions, to find out whether
they would need certain certificates before their unit could be operated in India. In order

49

Minna Svenfelt

to get a license for operating the unit Company A received support from their partner in
India to make sure that requirements were fulfilled. Also Company C had to make
adjustments. Such adjustments mainly concerned the documentation related to the
product. Among the most critical activites during opportunity exploitation for Company
C, was to communicate with the end customer and distributor, provide on-site service,
and make sure that their product met the customer‘s requirements:
“The most critical thing for us, was to make sure that we were offering what they actually
need for their research, because the worst thing is to sell an instrument that the customer
doesn’t actually need. That’s going to bring the worst publicity for your company. But
the second one is really for the on-site, let’s say on-site support for the customer, meaning
training the people who were then there in India on the use of the instruments and the
service of the instruments, so that the customer could have as much support on-site as
possible.” - Vice President and Sales Director, Company C
For Company B, the fact that they were providing new technology in their field at the
time, made it easier to convince end-customers of the value that they could get by
purchasing Company B’s product. Still, the respondent emphasised, that in the early
2000s, it was not as easy to just check and verify information over the internet. Thus, they
had to spend time and effort to convince the customer in India that they actually were a
legitimate company with a factory in Finland that could be trusted.

5.4 Internal influencing factors
The interviews also touched the topic of ‘internal influencing factors’ on the opportunity
exploration and exploitation process. In relation to this, the respondents were asked to
reflect upon the influence of prior knowledge and international experience on pursuing
the opportunity in India, as well as firm characteristics that may have had an impact on
the process.
None of the case companies had any experience of conducting business in emerging
markets prior to India. In recent years however, all case companies have gained such
experience, and recognise common aspects in all emerging market environments. India is
however perceived as more ‘chaotic’ compared to other markets. Related to this, all
respondents found India to be a difficult market to operate in and tended to compare their

50

Minna Svenfelt

experiences of the Indian market with those of the Chinese market, where the business
operations appears to have developed more evenly. A reoccurring topic was the difficulty
to fully grasp how the business environment worked in India. For instance, respondents
mentioned that conducting business in India will require one to be ready to deal with
bureaucracy and an immense amount of paper work. Furthermore, it brought challenges
to comprehend the decision making hierarchy and finding the right contacts that could
support in opportunity realisation.
The respondent for Company C expressed that a certain open-mindedness within the
company facilitated opportunity development in India:
“We have been very open-minded to go into more or less any market. Even if it then
proves to be difficult, or knowing the fact that you have to spend money and time to get
into the market… We’ve seen that only way for growth is to find the markets and I think
that the Indian market is slowly becoming better and better for us.” – Vice President and
Sales director, Company C
Previous international experience and knowledge gained through doing business in other
foreign markets was seen as an advantage in all cases. The respondents agreed that they
prepared for the Indian market to some extent through market research and consultation
with trade and export promotion agencies. Much of the information was provided by
export promotion agencies in the home market. However, it was highlighted that they
mainly learned about the Indian market ‘by doing’, i.e., throughout the process of
opportunity exploration and exploitation. In the case of Company A, they found that their
Indian market entry was quite unusual. This was due to the fact that they did not have
much prior knowledge of the market at the time of opportunity identification, nor did they
spend much effort on researching the market on their own. Instead, they relied on previous
experience from other markets and on the information received from the German
construction company and its joint venture partner in India as well as Finnish export
promotion agencies.
Company B did not have much international experience at the time of discovering the
market opportunity in India.

However, the managers of the company had gained

international experience during their previous careers. The mangers had done quite a lot
of travelling and were used to negotiating sales in international markets. The export and

51

Minna Svenfelt

international sales experience among the managers were utilised for advancing with the
opportunity in India. Yet, the respondent finds that the business environment in India is
unique, and that one will only learn it by doing. The respondent for Company B finds that
knowledge gained through other markets will only provide limited advantages. As for
Company C, their previous experience with the Japanese and UK market provided
support in pursuing the market opportunity in India. However, the respondent expressed
that it would have been useful to be more experienced:
“We had about five years of international experience before entering the Indian market.
And it would have definitely been helpful to have more experience at that point. At the
moment, right now, we have much better situation than what we had at that moment. So
we have developed the tools and the material needed so that we can support our
distributors as much as possible. So we definitely in a sense were not ready at that point..”
– Vice President and Sales director, Company C
The respondent for Company C further finds that it would have been beneficial to be able
to spend more time in India during the process. This way they could have dedicated more
efforts towards networking with end customers and the distributor, and arrange needed
training related to their products. Despite limited interest of the Indian market at the time
of opportunity identification, Company C already had a fairly good understanding of the
market in means of competitors and potential customers. The company had conducted
research on the number of universities in India, their placement in international rankings,
and what they were focused on, to gain an understanding of the potential number of
customers.

5.5 The influence of business network relationships
Upon discussing the role of business network relationships for opportunity exploration
and exploitation in India it was evident that network relationships had provided several
benefits in means of support, advice, and information. In all cases business network
relationships were central for exploiting the opportunities and advancing in the market.
In the case of Company A, the discovery of the first opportunity in India was attributed
to being a part of a business network. Without references from and connections to several
customers around Europe, they found it unlikely that the opportunity would have been
available and offered to them at the time. The respondent for Company A finds, that
52

Minna Svenfelt

previously successfully exploited projects in European markets brought them the
opportunity to pursue the Indian market. The respondent expressed her views in the
following way:
“If we didn’t have European customers using our products, then X never would have
known about us. We have to thank our European customers for making them aware of
us.” – CEO, Company A
Without the positive feedback from partners and customers in Europe, which were
conveyed to their German partner, the respondents thinks that it would have been unlikely
that the company would have considered business in India at the time. As for Case
Company B and C, a previously unknown external contact were essential for exploring
the first opportunity in India. In these two cases, the companies were approached by an
intermediate contact as well as a potential end-customer that were interested in their
products and providing further contacts for entry into the target market.
None of the case companies had any direct relationships in the Indian market prior to
discovering the opportunities. Thus, they all developed new relationships in the market
and utilised their extant relationships in both domestic and foreign markets for
opportunity development. Networking and finding local partners were perceived as
important part of pursuing business opportunities in India. Local partners were perceived
as the most beneficial contacts for acquiring detailed information and learning about the
market environment. Local partners were utilised as support in negotiations and meetings
with potential customers and distributors in the Indian market.

Furthermore, they

provided support in information gathering, handling of documents and setting up
meetings with key contacts in the market.
Finnish trade promotion agencies, such as Finnvera and Business Finland (former
Finpro), were utilised in all case companies to acquire knowledge about the Indian
market. The interviewees labelled this knowledge as ´more general´ in nature. The
companies consulted with these actors for the purpose of finding useful contacts in the
market and gain information about e.g., local regulations and product requirements,
finances, insurance and general information about the Indian market conditions. The
support received from these actors was valuable and provided courage to pursue a
previously unknown market:

53

Minna Svenfelt

“The people from Business Finland were able to provide some general information for
us, which actually gave us more courage to enter a market that was completely unknown
to us prior to this project.” – CEO, Company A
The case companies also exchanged information with other network actors within the
cleantech sector, such as industry-network contacts and industry forums. However, this
type of information exchange was for its most parts informal and general in nature, and
not directly related to opportunity development. Other important network contacts during
the process were e.g. transportation companies, insurance companies, the Finnish
chamber of commerce, the Finnish embassy, and law firms, who were used to review
agreements and ensure contractual safety.
For Case Company C, it has been difficult to find a suitable distributor in India. When the
company pursued it first opportunity in the market they received help from their
distributor in the UK to find a suitable partner. Later on, they ended up looking for a new
Indian partner. In this, they received assistance from one of their competitors.
All companies experienced some difficulty dealing with network relationships in the
Indian market. Interviewees mainly attributed these challenges to differences in the way
of conducting business. Challenges included e.g., delayed payments despite several
reminders. Upon inquiring about the payments case companies were met with what they
perceived as excuses. Collecting receivables from India as a small company from Finland
were perceived as a difficult issue to deal with. Pro-longed or ineffective negotiations
were also mentioned as network relationship related challenge. Further, one of the case
companies experienced sudden unresponsiveness and abruption in communication with
their partner in India. To sort out the situation, they received support from representatives
from the Finnish embassy, who were able to visit the Indian partner on-site at the time.
Through this visit they found out that the Indian partner had decided to work for a
competitor instead and was no longer interested in continuing the collaboration. Despite
the unfortunate event, Company B found a new local partner through the previous one.
As of today, they consider the new partner as a key person to the success they have
experienced in the market. Further, one respondent expressed the importance of finding
the real decision makers when advancing in the market. To this company, governmental
actors and public administration constitute important contacts for opportunity realisation
due to the fact that they have to undergo tender and bidding processes. Part of opportunity

54

Minna Svenfelt

exploitation thus involves discussions and personal meetings with local decision makers.
In order to find the key contacts, they utilise their local partner and the embassy, to assist
in finding the right contacts and arranging meetings with them. Without the support of
these contacts, they find that it could be difficult to be taken seriously as a small company
from Europe. In the case of Company A, they found it beneficial to have another European
company involved in the discussions with the partner in India. They found that the
European company easily understood their point of views and thus provided support in
negotiations and discussions related to the project. However, when it came to receiving
payment from the Indian partner as had been agreed, the other European company did not
provide the support that would have been welcomed at the time and Company A was left
to deal with the issue by itself.
Another issue, albeit not a direct problem of network relationships but rather a market
characteristic, was the occurrence of corruption. To advance with the business
opportunity, Case Company B found it difficult to get by due to the expectation of
briberies. According to this respondent, the local contacts involved in the tendering and
bidding process expected some personal gain from taking any action towards facilitating
the bidding process on behalf of Company B. The respondent further finds, that there are
many times personal interests involved in tendering processes, and if certain decision
makers find that the wrong company won the tender they could have the tender
withdrawn.
“It can be put in different ways, but practically briberies is what they are looking for.
That can be asked in different terms and conditions, but that’s the bottom line, that the
system works like that.” – Senior Vice President, Company B
The interviewee finds that they have, in a sense, ‘lost out on’ opportunities in India, as
they have not agreed to take part in any corruption. The respondent for Company C also
recognised the same issue, but estimate that they themselves do not directly encounter the
corruption, as they have a local partner ‘in the middle´ that face these issues. The
respondent for Company C expressed his views as follow:
“Talking to a lot of people in India, the corruption is sort of built into the system. Meaning
that in any step, if you want to pass the border, or you want to get the instruments past

55

Minna Svenfelt

customs, there is going to be some sort of extra fees included in that” – Vice President
and Sales director, Company C
Further, two of the case companies found that it was challenging to get to know the system
in India; as an ‘outsider’ small company from Finland, one could probably fully not
understand the political and business environment, which highlights the importance of
finding good and trustworthy local partners that are acquainted with the culture, political
environment and local way of conducting business. Another issue that was brought
forward was the length of the opportunity development process, i.e. the time between
opportunity identification and opportunity realisation. On a general level, Company B
finds it rather challenging, if not frustrating at times, to bring Indian market opportunities
towards realisation. For them, governmental institutions has with time became their
customer in India. Thus, it is under political decision and public tender if a project related
to reconditioning of water areas are fulfilled or not. To advance with the opportunity,
Company B dedicate time and effort towards convincing local decision makers in India
on the benefits of their product. However, elections may interrupt the progress, as key
decision-makers change they find that they are back to square one.
On a general level, all case companies recognised the usefulness of the cleantech network
in the home market for information sharing across different fields of business. One of the
case companies finds that the network of cleantech firms in Finland could be utilised to
cooperate in future opportunities in other emerging markets. According to Company B,
this network has also provided many useful contacts particularly in Asia and Africa,
where business is often done with governmental actors. Further, and as described above,
all case companies received support from governmental export promotion agencies
during opportunity exploitation. These type of network contacts also provided the courage
to pursue the Indian market despite uncertainty and risks. However, one of the case
companies finds that it is easier to receive help on general business matters such as
insurance, certification of documents and banking – while it has been more difficult to
receive more specified knowledge related to their business and the needs of their
customers, i.e. specific knowledge. The respondent attribute the lack of certain
knowledge in export promotion agencies to the niche market Company C operates in. The
respondent finds that the support provided in cleantech forums, trade fairs and the
‘general support network´ for internationalising firms in Finland is best suited for those

56

Minna Svenfelt

firms that do not operate in a niche market, but are rather focused on field with a broader
range of customers, such as waste management or water purification.

6 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This chapter analyses the interview results and connects the findings to the theoretical
framework used in this thesis. The conceptual model presented in the summarizing
chapter 3.2.6. is used to facilitate and structure the analysis of the results according to the
key themes presented in the conceptual model.
Opportunities can be explored in different ways and can emerge through purposeful
search, accidental discovery (Angelsberger et. al, 2017) or creation (Ardichvili et. al,
2003). The three cases in this study exemplifies the different circumstances that may lead
to opportunity identification as described above. The findings indicate that the
opportunity to engage in new international exchange with a new partner in a new foreign
market can be experienced as an accidental happenstance or accidental discovery. This
was the case for Company A. Company A had no prior plans to serve the Indian market
at the time of opportunity identification. The company was approached by another
network actor with an inquiry to take part in a project. In this sense, they were offered an
opportunity and did not deliberately look for an opportunity. The respondent for
Company A describes the discovery as an ´accident´. In a quite similar manner, Company
C was approached by a potential customer, who was interested in purchasing their
products. As a result, Company C recognised an opportunity for new exchange in India
and eventually decided to enact the opportunity at hand. In conclusion, Company A and
C identified their first opportunities in the Indian market through coincidental
circumstances in which an opportunity was more or less presented to them. Still,
opportunity recognition in Company A and C should not be seen as an outcome of pure
luck. Both of these companies had through earlier business operations and previous and
successfully conducted projects made themselves “receptive” to new international
opportunities. In addition, both of the companies were looking for growth in international
markets, although not specifically in India. As Hilmersson & Papaioannou (2015) bring
forward, SMEs can be less active and systematic in their search for opportunities, almost
to the point that the firm’s international business operations appear unplanned or
accidental. An example of this are spontaneous contacts or orders from potential
customers and partners in foreign markets that push the firm to make quick decisions
without having a full picture of the opportunity and its associated risks. (Crick & Spence,
2005). Such spontaneous contacts were specifically present in the cases of Companies A

58

Minna Svenfelt

and C, while also Company B was influenced by the fact that they were provided support
by a previously unknown contact in finding a suitable partner in India.
Opportunities can also be recognised by actively searching for them (Hilmersson &
Papaioannou, 2015). In this study, Company B provides an example of such an approach,
as the company managers bought company registers for the purpose of finding new
international customers. Eventually, they found their first Indian partner through which
they made their first sale in the market. The circumstances in which Company B came to
recognise their first opportunity in India resembles what Shane (2012) labels as
‘opportunity discovery’, meaning that opportunities can be realised by actively searching
for them, but the search behaviour may not always be purposeful. The findings of this
study also give support to existing literature on the suggestion that opportunities can be
explored through business network relationships (e.g. Blankenburg Holm et. al, 2015)
while network relationships also can provide new information or ideas that lead to
exploration of new opportunities (Ellis, 2011). Similar to the findings made by Kontinen
and Ojala (2011) the Cleantech SMEs identified their first opportunities in India through
new network ties, rather than existing network relationships. As stated earlier, the case
companies were approached by previously unknown external contacts that were
interested in their products. This again, awakened the interest in the Indian market. In line
with the findings of Zaefarian et. al (2016) and Kontinen and Ojala (2011), the study
illustrates that SMEs may not necessarily search for opportunities in their networks in a
purposeful way. Instead, they can come across opportunities accidentally, or the
opportunities are in a sense mediated by the network.
Some previous studies (see e.g. Evers & Knight, 2008 and Kontinen & Ojala, 2011),
emphasise the usefulness of trade fairs and trade exhibitions for the recognition of new
international opportunities. The results here indicate quite the opposite. On the other
hand, this study focused on opportunity exploration and exploitation in the context of the
first opportunity in the Indian market. As such, it does not reveal the role of trade
fairs/exhibitions in the exploration of other foreign market opportunities. Cleantech and
industry forums as well as trade fairs were seen as useful platforms for networking in
general. However, in the case of realising the first opportunity in the Indian market, this
type of platform for networking appeared to have a very limited role, although case
companies valued the possibility to share experiences and information with other

59

Minna Svenfelt

cleantech companies. Company C, finds that events such as international research
conferences constitute an important platform for international opportunity exploration in
general. Such events provide a platform for networking with new potential customers and
presenting their instruments. For them, cleantech trade fairs provide little benefits due to
the fact that the company serves a niche and scientific market, which tends to not be very
well represented at cleantech events in general.
According to Ardichvili et. al (2003) opportunities are essentially made as they always
include some degree of creativity. As can be expected, the interview results provide
support to the authors reasoning, as the study does not solely focus on opportunity
exploration, but also the subsequent phase of opportunity exploitation. Opportunity
exploitation can be argued to include some degree of creativity, as is it requires that the
company works the opportunity in a variety of ways in order to bring it towards
realisation. In all three cases, the companies undertook a variety of activities to realise,
i.e. exploit, the opportunities. Exploitation activities were quite similar in all three cases
and included e.g., evaluation, travelling, networking, negotiations, product modification
according to market/customer requirements, market research, and consultation with
external sources to receive advice regarding e.g., general market infirmation, local
requirements related to the product, insurance, legal issues, and financial matters. With a
few additions, these findings are in line with Kuckertz et. al (2017), who conclude that
opportunity exploitation is a multifaceted activity, that can constitute for instance; 1) the
development of a product or service based on the perceived opportunity, 2) the acquiring
of suitable human resources 3) understanding customers and the market 4) gathering
financial resources and 5) setting up the organisation.
The important role of business network relationships was highlighted in each case. The
companies sought support in means of knowledge and advice from other network actors
particularly for opportunity evaluation and realisation. These findings find support in the
literature with for instance Johanson and Vahlne (2011) and Sharma and Blomstermo
(2003) who state that business network relationships can provide experience, learning and
knowledge needed to explore and exploit opportunities in foreign markets. Particularly
important were the support received from intermediary and institutional network actors
such as export promotion agencies, Finnish embassy and the chamber of commerce. Such
contacts provided market-specific knowledge, support in negotiations and new contacts

60

in the Indian market. These findings are in line with for instance Ojala (2009), who
observed that SMEs develop networks with export promotion organisations in the home
and/or host country, to enable them to gain new contacts in the target market.
SMEs extant network relationships with e.g. competitors, distributors and other industry
contacts were also important for the purpose of establishing new contacts in India. For
instance, in the case of Company C, the distributor in the UK supported them in paper
work and in finding a suitable partner in India. In addition, they consulted with a
competitor to find their current distributor in India.
The benefits of network relationships for opportunity exploration and exploitation
exceeded the disadvantages by far. In general, few studies have focused on the negative
aspects of network relationships for opportunity exploration and exploitation. (Ellis,
2011). The interview results indicate that the case companies in this study experienced
few downsides regarding the matter. However, it was brought forward that the companies
faced difficulties in getting paid by their Indian partners. For instance, in one case, the
partner had a way of postponing payment until they were forced to pay the overdue bills
to be able to place a new order on spare parts. Communication issues in the form of sudden
unresponsiveness or passiveness were also mentioned in the discussions on relationship
drawbacks. In one case, the company had to involve a third party, the Finnish embassy,
to sort out the situation. Pro-longed discussions, ineffective negotiations and bureaucracy
were also brought forward on the topic of network relationship related challenges during
the process. To some extent the challenges were attributed to cultural differences and an
overall different approach towards handling business related matters. As for instance
Sakarya et. al. (2006) states, a company pursuing business in emerging markets need to
prepare for dealing with cultural differences. Further, the companies encountered the
problem of corruption when doing business in India. This was not really seen as drawback
of network relationships themselves, but rather a market characteristic that brought
challenges upon opportunity realisation. As mentioned by Cavusgil et. al (2002), the lack
of physical infrastructure along with high level of corruption constitute common
challenges for companies operating in emerging markets.
Earlier experience of international business functioned as an incentive for opportunity
development in India among the studied SMEs in the sense that it gave the companies
previous knowledge to rely on for opportunity development. Also such experience that

61

Minna Svenfelt

had be gained by managers during their earlier careers appeared to have an encouraging
effect on pursuing opportunities. To some extent, earlier experience of ventures in foreign
markets appeared to contribute to a certain open-mindedness towards realising the
opportunity despite uncertainties and challenges along the process. In sum, both
individual a firm level former experience appeared to have a positive influence on
opportunity development. Further, the eagerness to grow the business was seen as a
driving force behind opportunity development.

Besides earlier experience in

international business, having the right contacts, a good product, and networking skills
were also seen to facilitate international opportunity development.
None of the SMEs had particularly much prior knowledge of the Indian market. Such
knowledge were said to be developed during the opportunity development process. As
discussed by e.g. Johanson and Kao (2015), firms entering emerging markets may not
always have adequate market knowledge, and the lack of such knowledge does not have
to constitute a barrier for foreign market entry. Such knowledge is commonly not
distributed freely in EMs and thus, it may also be difficult to obtain (Johanson & Kao,
2010). In this study, it appears that knowledge specific to the Indian market, such as
knowledge related to local laws, political system, business environment, competitors etc.
did not have an influence on opportunity identification, as suggested by for instance
Shane (2000). While earlier knowledge gained through everyday business operations and
experiences of conducting business in other international markets were useful and
provided courage to pursue the Indian market, it was brought forward that such
knowledge provided limited advantages for opportunity development in India. The Indian
market was perceived as different compared to any other market the companies had
gained experience of. It was expressed that one must ´learn the market by doing´ and
develop efficient and trustworthy contacts in the market to get by. According to Johanson
and Vahlne (2006), experiential knowledge, as described above, can reduce uncertainty
associated with making commitments to a foreign market, meanwhile such knowledge
also functions as a framework for the recognition and development of opportunities.

7 CONCLUSIONS
In the following, a concluding discussion of the findings will be presented by
reconnecting with the aim and research questions for this study. The chapter ends with a
discussion on the limitations of the study and suggestions for further research.
The aim of this thesis was to develop an understanding of what constitutes opportunity
exploration and exploitation among Finnish cleantech SMEs pursuing opportunities in
the emerging market of India, and the role of business network relationships during the
process. The intent was to understand the activities involved in the international
opportunity development process, and the ways that the SME engage with other business
network actors to pursue an international opportunity. In the following, the research
questions that were defined to support the aim of the study will be addressed once again
with answers.
RQ1: How do SMEs explore and exploit opportunities (in international markets) through
business network relationships?
Like any other business, SMEs are part of business networks. In the network, the SME is
directly and indirectly connected to a variety of network actors through relationships that
can span country borders. The exchange of resources, such as knowledge, information
and technology, is a prominent feature of business network relationships. Exploring and
exploiting international opportunities requires resources that the SME may not have on
its own. Resource constraints can limit a smaller firm’s abilities to pursue opportunities
in international markets. Through interaction in relationships, or by creating new
relationships, the SME can benefit from resources held by other network actors. By
obtaining the needed resources through its relationships, the firm can facilitate the
development of its own international opportunity. Furthermore, business networks and
the inherent relationships constitute an important ground for sharing information and
knowledge that may not be available to everyone. Hence, everyday business operations
and interaction in business network relationships can also lead to the discovery of new
and meaningful information, or generate ideas, that lead to the formation of new
international opportunities.

63

RQ2: How are opportunities explored and exploited among Finnish Cleantech SMEs
aiming to enter the Indian market?
The process of opportunity exploration and exploitation is dependent on context. Thus,
opportunities can emerge differently under different circumstances. Prior knowledge,
international experience and certain firm characteristics, such as the willingness to take
risks and an open-minded and curious attitude towards new information and relationships,
are here suggested to influence how international opportunities are explored, and what
kind of opportunities subsequently are exploited. While some SMEs, in a sense, may
stumble upon the opportunity to pursue the Indian market, others search actively for new
opportunities. Therefore, the question of how opportunities are explored and exploited
among Finnish cleantech SMEs aiming for the Indian market can unfold differently from
time to time. Consequently, the activities during the process may also vary. The findings
illustrate that Finnish cleantech SMEs can identify Indian market opportunities through
accidental happenstance, search, and discovery. In this study, all firms were open to new
international opportunities, although not specifically in India. The idea of pursuing the
Indian market was influenced by external circumstances. The fact that the case companies
were approached by previously unknown external parties triggered the firms to undertake
further actions towards opportunity realisation. This indicates the presence of both
reactive and proactive behavior among cleantech SMEs in relation to Indian market
opportunities.
The findings show that cleantech SMEs engage in a variety of activities for opportunity
exploitation in India. Such activities include networking, acquiring knowledge of the
market, adapting the product to local market needs and requirements, seeking financial
and legal advice, acquiring transportation services, visiting on-site to familiarize and
negotiate with the partners and end customers, and to learn about the local culture and
way of doing business. In these activities, the SMEs sought and received support from
their business network relationships. Without this support, it would have been difficult
to advance with the opportunity.
RQ3: What are the benefits and drawbacks of using business network relationships
among Finnish Cleantech SMEs internationalising to India?

64

Minna Svenfelt

For Finnish cleantech SMEs, business network relationships can provide several benefits
during the process of international opportunity development. The empirical findings
illustrate that opportunities can emerge as a result of being a part of business networks.
Previously successfully exploited opportunities, customer references, and initiation of
new business relationships may lead to the opening up of a new foreign market
opportunity. Business network relationships can be utilised for knowledge acquisition,
function as mediators to new contacts such as distributors and partners, and provide
general support and advice for opportunity evaluation and realisation. The findings reveal
that cleantech SMEs rely on support from their network relationships particularly for
opportunity realisation. The lack of market knowledge among internationalising
cleantech SMEs can be overcome through the support of export promotion organisations
such as Business Finland. Without supporting resources such as new contacts and
knowledge provided by these actors, the SMEs would have found it difficult to pursue
the Indian market. The drawbacks of relationships for opportunity exploration and
exploitation appear to be few. However, the findings indicate that the SME should be
prepared to deal with cultural differences that may inflict upon communication,
negotiations and receiving on-time payments. The drawbacks mentioned in the cases
included inefficiency and slowness in communication and handling business matters
overall. These difficulties were seen to partly stem from cultural differences, bureaucracy
and, to some extent, the occurrence of passiveness in relationships.
RQ4: What are the implications for SME managers involving business network
relationships in international opportunity development?
To develop opportunities in an emerging market such as India marks the importance of
being conscious about one’s network relationships. Utilising extant relationships and
developing new ones can provide several benefits for opportunity development in a
previously unknown and challenging market environment. Managers and entrepreneurs
of SMEs should see networking as a strategic tool both for accessing new opportunities
for international exchange and for exploiting current ones. For instance, participation in
trade fairs can function as platforms for building new contacts that may lead to the
discovery of new opportunities, or provide meaningful information that spur opportunity
exploration and exploitation. In the current study, visiting end customers and partners

65

Minna Svenfelt

on-site were an important measure for building relationships in the Indian market and
ensure that customer requirements were met.
While the findings of this study shows that the advantages business network relationships
can provide exceeds the drawbacks by far, it is noteworthy that managers should focus
on finding and developing trustworthy and reliable relationships. It is also worth
acknowledging that finding the right partners can be a process of trial and error.
Intermediary network contacts such as trade and export promotion agencies and
institutional actors such as the Finnish embassy can provide support in finding key
contacts. Further, the findings indicate that these same actors can support in creating
credibility that can be otherwise challenging to attain as a small business with no prior
experience of the Indian market and lack of network contacts. Thus, managers should
acknowledge the readily available support these actors can provide when pursuing foreign
market opportunities. Further, the findings point towards the potential benefits of both
managers’ and employees’ previous experiences professional-wise, when it comes to the
development of new international opportunities. Earlier experience in e.g., international
sales can provide contacts and ideas that can be fruitful for future opportunity exploration.
The experiences of Company B and C also illustrate that the managers should prepare for
a process that can take longer than expected, which requires strength of character,
adaptability and continuous interest to learn.

7.1 Limitations and suggestions for further research
This study has its limitations due to the small number of cases involved. Furthermore, the
findings rely on the subjective views of the respondents that were interviewed. In one of
the cases it was not possible to interview the managers who were involved in the
opportunity development in India at the time. Therefore, it is acknowledged that this could
have influenced the accuracy of the data to some extent.
To date, a relatively limited number of studies have been conducted on the topic of
international opportunities, which in itself, makes it a fruitful topic for further research.
While this study focused on the initial international opportunity that had been explored
and exploited among Finnish cleantech SMEs in the Indian market, further studies could
broaden the sample by studying international opportunity development across different
industries. The topic could also be studied from the perspective of firms originating from
66

Minna Svenfelt

other small and open economies, or firms internationalising to other emerging markets.
While emerging markets bear similar traits, they have their differences that may inflict
upon the SMEs experiences of the opportunity development process. In this study, such
differences were briefly revealed during each interview, as the respondents tended to
compare experiences of the Indian market particularly with those of the Chinese market.
Further, future studies could investigate how SMEs explore and exploit subsequent
opportunities in an emerging market context once the initial opportunity has been
exploited.

8 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH
Avhandlingens titel
“Ett nätverksperspektiv på utforskande och utnyttjande av affärsmöjligheter på en
tillväxtmarknad – En studie om finska små och medelstora företag inom
miljötekniksektorn”
Inledning
Tillväxtmarknaderna har blivit allt mer viktiga för framtida företagsverksamhet. Dessa
marknader erbjuder många affärsmöjligheter även för små och medelstora företag (Sheth,
2011). Mindre företag söker ofta tillväxt genom internationalisering. Det är dock
karakteristiskt för småföretag att ha mindre eller otillräckliga resurser, vilket inverkar på
deras möjligheter att ta sig in på internationella marknader (Holmlund & Kock, 1999).
För att hantera sina begränsade resurser kan ett mindre företag utnyttja sina
nätverksrelationer (Sandberg, 2014). Relationer med andra aktörer i nätverket är speciellt
viktiga när ett företag ämnar utnyttja affärsmöjligheter på tillväxtmarknaderna, eftersom
dessa marknader skiljer sig från utvecklade marknader på flera sätt, vilket medför
utmaningar för ett företag som ämnar ta sig in på dessa marknader (Fiedler et. al, 2017).
Att söka och identifiera internationella möjligheter är aktuellt bland små och medelstora
företag inom miljötekniksektorn i Finland. Dessa företag erbjuder lösningar som främjar
hållbar användning av naturresurser och fungerar samtidigt som drivkraft för en hållbar
tillväxt (Saarenketo et. al, 2018). De största marknaderna för den här typen av verksamhet
finns dock utomlands där miljöfrågor är mer framträdande (Finnvera, 2016). Snabbt
industrialiserande länder såsom Indien har specifika behov av lösningar för att kontrollera
miljöpåverkan, medan utvecklingsländer i allmänhet söker lösningar för att tillgodose det
grundläggande behovet av energi, vatten, sanitet och infrastruktur (Yrittäjät, 2012).
Finländska miljöteknikföretag anses ha stor potential på internationella marknader, men
kommersialiseringen av produkt- och tjänsteinnovationer inom miljötekniksektorn har
ännu inte nått full potential på den globala scenen (Saarenketo et al., 2018). Flera
institutioner har även betonat de möjligheter som miljötekniksektorn ger den finska
ekonomin (Leinonen, 2019). Genom att bidra till information om hur dessa företag
internationaliseras, samt genom att framhäva de inneboende framgångsfaktorerna under

68

Minna Svenfelt

processen kan man bidra till den internationella tillväxten av företag inom denna sektor
(Saarenketo et al., 2018).
Gentemot denna bakgrund syftar denna studie till att utveckla en förståelse av hur små
och medelstora företag utforskar och utnyttjar möjligheter för att ta sig in på den indiska
marknaden. På grund av de utmaningar som mindre företag möter i form av
resursbegränsningar såväl som särprägeln med att bedriva affärer på tillväxtmarknaderna
– ämnar denna avhandling lyfta fram hur företagens affärsnätverksrelationer inverkar på
processen.
Syfte, avgränsning och forskningsfrågor
Syftet med denna avhandling är att utveckla en förståelse för hur små och medelstora
företag inom miljötekniksektorn i Finland utforskar och utnyttjar affärsmöjligheter i
Indien, samt hur företagens affärsnätverksrelationer inverkar på denna process. Avsikten
är att förstå de aktiviteter som ingår i utvecklingen av en internationell affärsmöjlighet
och de sätt på vilka företaget interagerar med andra nätverksaktörer för att utnyttja en
affärsmöjlighet på en utländsk marknad. Avhandlingens syfte stöds av följande
forskningsfrågor:
1. Hur utforskar och utnyttjar små och medelstora företag internationella
affärsmöjligheter genom affärsnätverksrelationer?
2. Hur

utforskas

och

utnyttjas

möjligheter

bland

små

och

medelstora

miljöteknikföretag i Finland, som eftersträvar att ta sig in på den Indiska
marknaden?
3. Vilka är för- och nackdelarna med att använda sig av affärsnätverksrelationer
bland små och medelstora miljöteknikföretag i Finland som ämnar att ta sig in på
den indiska marknaden?
4. Vilka är implikationerna för chefer i små och medelstora företag som använder
sig av affärsnätverksrelationer i utvecklingen av internationella affärsmöjligheter?
Avhandlingen är begränsad till små och medelstora företag som verkar inom
miljötekniksektorn i Finland och den geografiska kontexten är Indien. I fokus är den
första internationella affärsmöjlighet som företaget identifierat på den indiska marknaden
samt de aktiviteter företagen engagerat sig i för att utforska och senare utnyttja

69

Minna Svenfelt

affärsmöjligheten. Avhandlingen utelämnar inverkande faktorer såsom kognition och
personlighetsdrag bland chefer och entreprenörer i de studerade företagen.
Nätverk kan studeras ur flera olika perspektiv. I den här studien studeras nätverk endast
från ett relationsperspektiv och fokuset ligger på de direkta relationer företaget har med
andra aktörer i affärsnätverket.

Studien implementerar ett så kallat ”Fokal aktör

perspektiv”. Enligt Halinen och Törnroos (2005) innebär det här perspektivet hur en
specifik aktör, såsom ett företag eller en individ ser på affäsrelationsnätverket. För den
här avhandlingen innebär detta att det studerade fenomenet endast undersöks från
fallföretagets perspektiv. I den här avhandlingen avser det fokala affärsrelationsnätverket
de viktigaste aktörerna som fallföretagen varit i direkt kontakt med under utvecklingen
och bearbetningen av sina internationella affärsmöjligheter.
Metodval och insamling av data
I avhandlingen tillämpas en kvalitativ forskningsmetod. En kvalitativ metod ansågs
lämplig då avhandlingens syfte är explorativt, dvs. syftet att skapa en förståelse av hur
små och medelstora företag inom miljötekniksektorn i Finland utforskar och utnyttjar
internationella affärsmöjligheter, samt hur deras affärsnätverksrelationer inverkar på
processen. För att uppnå en mer djupgående förståelse av ämnet i fråga ansågs det
lämpligt att tillämpa en kvalitativ metod i form av fallstudier med några utvalda företag.
Fallstudier kan genomföras på ett flertal sätt. Bryman och Bell (2011) nämner att en av
fördelarna med att involvera flera fall är att man kan jämföra resultaten mellan de olika
fallen. Genom att involvera tre fallföretag i den här studien är tanken att likheter och
olikheter mellan fallen kan identifieras. Vidare grundar sig denna tillämpning på
antagandet att flera fall kan tänkas berika forskningresultaten av det studerade fenomenet.
Fallstudien kan vara ett lämpligt tillvägagångssätt när syftet är att studera ett fenomen på
djupet samtidigt som de studerade objekten är få (Farquhar, 2012). Metoden tillåter en
granskning av komplexa organisatoriska, ledningsmässiga eller andra företagsrelaterade
frågor, som skulle vara svåra att studera med kvantitativa metoder (Eriksson &
Kovalainen, 2008). I den här studien valdes fallföretagen ut baserat på ett antal kriterier
som ställts upp på förhand. Fem potentiella fallföretag kontaktades med en förfrågan om
att delta i undersökningen. De blev erbjudna möjligheten att förbli anonyma i
undersökningen. Slutligen deltog tre olika miljöteknikföretag i undersökningen.

70

Minna Svenfelt

Som den huvudsakliga datainsamlingsmetoden fungerade semistrukturerade intervjuer
med representanter från vart och ett av fallföretagen. Yin (2018) rekommenderar
användning av ett flertal informationskällor för att berika forskningen. I denna avhandling
har utöver intervjuer använts andra källor, såsom information tillgänglig på fallföretagens
hemsidor. Intervjuerna arrangerades på distans som videointervjuer med en representant
från vart och ett av företagen. Intervjuerna genomfördes i november-december 2020.
Intervjuerna transkriberades kort efter att intervjuerna genomförts för att underlätta
resultatanalysen. En kort sammanställning av intervjuerna skickades till varje respondent
för att säkerställa svarens riktighet och reda ut eventuella oklarheter.
Resultatbeskrivning och analys
Forskningsresultaten visar att företagen identifierat möjligheter att bedriva nya affärer
med nya internationella partner i Indien på olika sätt. Interaktion i nätverksrelationer kan
bidra till att nya möjligheter identifieras, samtidigt som identifieringen av nya möjligheter
kan vara ett resultat av sökande eller oavsiktliga omständigheter eller sammanträffanden.
Ur resultaten framträder att fallföretagen blev kontaktade av en utomstående aktör, som
uttryckte intresse för fallföretagens produkter eller lösningar. Det här ledde till att
fallföretagen vidtog vidare åtgärder för att utnyttja och profitera på de nya
affärsmöjligheterna.
För att utnyttja möjligheterna på den indiska marknaden engagerar sig företagen i
tillsynes liknande aktiviteter. Framför allt visar det sig vara viktigt att representanter från
företaget reser till Indien och personligen träffar slutkunden och potentiella affärspartner
för att bygga upp de nya relationerna. Dessa visiter visar sig även vara viktiga för att
bekanta sig med den lokala kulturen, förhandla kontrakt och reda ut krav och
förväntningar på produkten. Fallföretagen sökte stöd exempelvis från handelsfrämjande
instanser såsom Business Finland och sina lokala affärspartner för att erhålla information
om den indiska marknaden. Affärsnätverksrelationer visar sig vara viktiga framförallt för
att utnyttja möjligheter, då de kan bidra med kunskap, information och åtkomst till nya
nätverk och relationer. Sådana resurser är i sin tur viktiga för att kunna omvandla
affärsmöjligheten till något av värde. Ur resultaten framträder även att fallföretagen hade
begränsad tidigare kunskap om den indiska marknaden. Dessa begränsningar hanterades
till stor del genom att söka stöd från andra nätverksaktörer i de frågor där den egna
kunskapen inte räckte till. Dessa frågor kunde vara mera specifika t.ex. gällande lokala

71

Minna Svenfelt

bestämmelser och krav relaterade till produkten, eller mer generella frågor, såsom den
indiska marknadens karaktärsdrag.
Forskningsresultaten påvisade att fallföretagen upplevde få nackdelar beträffande sina
affärsnätverksrelationer. De nackdelar som nämndes var relaterade till svårigheter att
erhålla betalning av affärspartnern i Indien samt plötsligt uppehåll i kommunikationen
eller passivitet. Dessa utmaningar ansågs delvis uppkomma som följd av kulturskillnader
och överlag olika tillvägagångssätt gällande hantering av affärsrelaterade frågor. Vidare
ansågs förekomsten av korruption i form av mutor vara ett problem som försvårade
förverkligandet av affärsmöjligheten. Korruptionen ansågs vara ett problem relaterat till
marknaden och dess särdrag, snarare än ett problem relaterat till nätverket.
Diskussion, slutsats och förslag på forsatt forskning
Avslutningsvis kan konstateras att affärsnätverksrelationer är viktiga både för att
identifiera och utveckla nya affärsmöjligheter på internationella marknader. Utan det stöd
som erhållits från andra nätverksaktörer skulle inträdet på den indiska marknaden varit
svår att genomföra bland fallföretagen. Såväl den empiriska som teoretiska delen av
denna avhandling bekräftar således vikten av relationerna med andra aktörer i nätverket.
Affärsnätverksrelationerna bidrar till distribution av information och kunskap, som kan
främja både upptäckten och utvecklingen av nya möjligheter på internationella
marknader.
Studien visar att små och medelstora företag inom miljötekniksektorn i Finland
identifierar möjligheter på den indiska marknaden på varierande sätt. Det bör även
framhävas att det sätt på vilket affärsmöjligheter identifieras och följaktligen utnyttjas
påverkas av kontext och därmed kan processen antas utspela sig aningen olika gång för
gång. För att utnyttja möjligheter på den indiska marknaden engagerar sig företagen i ett
flertal aktiviteter som finner stöd i tidigare undersökningar. Dessa aktiviteter inkluderar
nätverksbyggande, resor till Indien för att bekanta sig med kulturen, slutkunden och
samarbetspartner, arrangering av transporttjänster, förvärvande av kunskap, information
och råd gällande marknaden, samt sökande av råd gällande finansiella och juridiska
frågor. Nackdelarna med att involvera affärsnätverksrelationer i processen är få.
Resultaten indikerar ändå vikten av att utveckla affärsrelationer som baserar sig på

72

Minna Svenfelt

förtroende. Samtidigt bör vidkännas, att det kan ta tid att hitta en för företaget passande
affärspartner i Indien.
Forskningsresultaten påvisar även ett antal manageriella implikationer. Att utveckla
affärsmöjligheter på en framväxande marknad såsom Indien framhäver vikten av att vara
medveten om ens nätverksrelationer. Att utnyttja befintliga relationer och utveckla nya
kan ge flera fördelar när företaget utvecklar nya affärsmöjligheter i en tidigare okänd och
utmanande marknadsmiljö. Således bör chefer och företagare av små och medelstora
företag se nätverkande som ett strategiskt verktyg både för att identifiera och utveckla
nya affärsmöjligheter. Vidare indikerar resultaten att chefer kan vinna fördelar i att beakta
betydelsen av tidigare internationell erfarenhet bland sina anställda. Erfarenhet av
exempelvis internationell försäljning kan bidra med kontakter och kunskapsmässig
erfarenhet som kan utnyttjas i företagets framtida utforskning av internationella
affärsmöjligheter.
Hittills har en relativt begränsad mängd studier genomförts specifikt om ämnet
internationella affärsmöjligheter, vilket i sig gör det till ett potentiellt tema för vidare
forskning. Medan denna studie fokuserade på internationella möjligheter som hade
utforskats och utnyttjats i Indien bland små och medelstora miljöteknikföretag i Finland,
kunde ytterligare studier utvidga urvalet genom att studera fenomenet från andra
perspektiv. Det här kunde genomföras genom att fokusera på andra branscher eller andra
tillväxtmarknader utöver Indien. Medan tillväxtmarknader har liknande egenskaper, har
de sina skillnader som kan inverka på hur företag upplever processen att ta sig in på
marknaden. I denna studie avslöjades sådana skillnader kortfattat under varje intervju,
eftersom respondenterna tenderade att jämföra sina upplevelser från den indiska
marknaden, särskilt med de erfarenheter de hade från den kinesiska marknaden. Vidare
kan framtida studier genomföras för att undersöka hur små och medelstora företag
utforskar och utnyttjar efterföljande affärsmöjligheter i Indien, dvs. de möjligheter som
identifieras när den första möjligheten har förverkligats. Detta skulle kunna bidra till ett
mera långsiktigt perspektiv gällande hur företagen etablerar sig på marknaden och
framhäva de nätverksrelationer som är viktiga i ett senare skede.
