Title of the Thesis: The Obligation on Abolitionist States to Withhold Assistance in Foreign
Proceedings That May Result in Death Penalty
Supervisor: Catarina Krause
Abstract:
In 2018, the UK Home Secretary agreed to provide information on two prisoners facing capital charges in
the US, despite the US refusing to provide assurances that the death penalty will not be sought for the
individuals in question. This decision was made despite the UK’s status as a death penalty abolitionist
State, and despite its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”) and
the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”). Upon challenge in 2019, the UK Queen’s Bench
upheld the Home Secretary’s decision, in the case Maha Elgizouli. While the UK Supreme Court
overturned the Queen’s Bench decision in 2020, its rationale rested on the UK’s data privacy law, with the
majority asserting that international law and UK common law had not yet developed so as to recognise an
obligation on abolitionist States to withhold the provision Mutual Legal Assistance (“MLA”) to retentionist
States for use in criminal proceedings that may result in death penalty, in the absence of assurances that
capital punishment will not be imposed.
This study examines the accuracy of this assertion in the international context. When considering the extent
to which abolitionist States can be held responsible in these circumstances, we are presented with a
complex web of international legal doctrine. This study considers how the relevant rules and principles
operate and interact, with the aim of determining and clarifying the conditions in which abolitionist States
party to the ICCPR and/or the ECHR may be held responsible for facilitating the use of the death penalty
through the provision of MLA. By considering the law of State responsibility for internationally wrongful
acts alongside relevant human rights law stemming from the ICCPR and the ECHR, this study asserts that
such an obligation can be discerned from these conventions (especially considering that both instruments
prohibit abolitionist States from extraditing or expelling individuals where there is risk they will face
capital punishment in the receiving State). However, this study outlines that, from a jurisdictional
standpoint, there are factual and conceptual differences between extradition and provision of MLA, which
may impede a finding of direct State responsibility in the circumstances of this study.
Accordingly, this study moves to examine the law on State complicity in the death penalty. Through
examining State responsibility for “aid and assistance” per the International Law Commission’s Articles on
State Responsibility, the “obligation to protect” in human rights law, and the concept of complicity in other
contexts of the human rights framework, this thesis arrives at the conclusion that if jurisdictional limits of
the ICCPR and the ECHR obstruct a finding of primary responsibility of the abolitionist State, derivative
responsibility can still be established in these circumstances, for the State’s “aid or assistance” in capital
punishment.
Key words:
Mutual Legal Assistance, death penalty, complicity, state responsibility, internationally wrongful acts,
obligation to protect, extradition, extraterritorial jurisdiction, non-facilitation, right to life, lex specialis.

1. Introduction
1.1.

Background to the Study

Mutual legal assistance (herein “MLA” or “assistance”) is a practice through which one State
provides assistance to another State with evidence and/or intelligence, which is used in the
criminal investigation and prosecution for offences in the latter State. 1 The prosecuting or
judicial authority of one State makes a specific request to another State for assistance, 2
including for “the provision of evidence, documentary or viva voce, for use abroad; the
search and seizure of evidence for use in foreign proceedings; the transfer of witnesses for
interview; and the serving of documents originating in another jurisdiction.” 3 With our
increasingly globalised world, it is clear that States need to cooperate with one another in this
manner, in order to sufficiently investigate and prosecute various criminal matters. However,
a legal, political and moral dilemma emerges when abolitionist States provide MLA to nonabolitionist States, and that assistance facilitates the use of the death penalty. 4

MLA is largely a creature of treaty law, both multilaterally (such as the European Convention
on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters)5 and bilaterally (many bilateral treaties are
modelled on the United Nations (“UN”) Model Law on Mutual Assistance in Criminal
Matters).6

There is no explicit statement in any of these treaties that MLA must be withheld

without obtaining assurances that judicial execution will not be imposed (“Death Penalty

Assurances”). However, many abolitionist States have policies stating that they will consider
withholding MLA in the absence of death penalty assurances.7

The European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”) prohibit their State parties from extraditing individuals
to death penalty retentionist States, where there is foreseeable risk of the death penalty being
imposed (and where the State has not first obtained assurances that the individuals will not be
subjected to capital punishment). What is not clear, however, is whether this prohibition
extends to circumstances beyond extradition, namely to the situation where abolitionist States
wish to provide MLA to retentionist States, where such assistance may similarly facilitate the
use of the death penalty in the MLA-receiving State.

This issue has been highlighted in the recent United Kingdom (“UK”) decisions in the case
Maha Elgizouli, first examined by the Queen’s Bench, 8 and then, on appeal, by the Supreme
Court.9

This case concerned MLA requests to aid in the prosecution of a British individual

(now stripped of his citizenship), who allegedly belonged to an Islamic State cell involved in
the murder of hostages in Syria. The Queen’s Bench controversially found that it was lawful
for the UK Home Secretary to authorise the provision of MLA to the United States (“US”), in
support of the criminal investigation that could lead to prosecution for offences that carry a
death penalty sentence, without first obtaining assurances that the death penalty will not be
imposed.10

While the Supreme Court overturned the Queen’s Bench decision, it did so on

the basis of the MLA consisting of personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-security-and-justice-assistance-osja-guidance (last
accessed 14 April 2020), stage 3, para. 9. This document sets out procedures that should be followed by
British authorities when providing MLA, and states that “a) Written assurances should be sought before
agreeing to the provision of assistance that anyone found guilty would not face the death penalty”, and “b)
Where no assurances are forthcoming or where there are strong reasons not to seek assurances, the case should
automatically be deemed ‘High Risk’ and FCO Ministers should be consulted to determine whether, given the
specific circumstances of the case, we should nevertheless provide assistance.” (italics added, underlining found
in original). See also supra., (note 4), Barhat Malkaini (written submission to the HRC), paras. 8-12.

Act 2018,11 concluding that the decision to provide such information was unlawful under Part
3 of that Act.12

On the other ground of appeal, whether it was unlawful for the UK to

facilitate the use of the death penalty in a foreign State through provision of MLA, 13 the
majority found that the law had not yet developed so as to prohibit provision of MLA in such
circumstances. 14 However, Lord Kerr’s judgment disagreed with the majority, finding the
Home Secretary’s decision to provide MLA without requisite assurances unlawful on both
grounds of appeal.

1.2.

Research Aim and Question

Although Maha Elgizouli is a domestic rather than an international decision, this case
highlights the lack of certainty in this area (especially given that the UK Human Rights Act
incorporates the ECHR into UK domestic law). 15 The problem addressed in this study has
yet to be scrutinised on an international level, relevant conventions are silent on the subject,
and even esteemed Supreme Court justices disagree on the status of international and
domestic law on the matter.

More than two thirds of States worldwide have abolished the

death penalty in law or in practice, 16 and thus the clarification of legal obligations would
impact a large number of States, as well as clarify the extent of relevant fundamental rights
for individuals in such circumstances. With States routinely providing MLA to one another

This ground of appeal was also raised by the Queen’s Bench as a question of public importance: “Whether it

whom the evidence is sought.” Supra., (note 9), Maha Elgizouli (SC decision), paras. 3 and 19.

in criminal matters, and with the emerging challenge presented by the prosecution of Foreign
Terrorist Fighters (“FTF”),17 there is a growing need for legal clarity in this area.

Therefore, this study aims to clarify abolitionist States legal obligations, by answering the
following research question: Are death penalty abolitionist States who are party to the
European Convention on Human Rights and/or the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights prohibited from providing Mutual Legal Assistance to death penalty
retentionist States for use in criminal proceedings that may result in prosecution for offences
carrying the death penalty, when the abolitionist State has not obtained adequate assurances
from the retentionist State that the death penalty will not be imposed?

1.3.

Method and Material

To answer this research question, this thesis adopts a doctrinal method, employing legal
research methodology. This study discerns and analyses the current status of the law by
locating and examining the relevant primary and secondary sources of law governing the
field of this study. More specifically, the status of the law in this area is ascertained through
analysing applicable primary sources (in this context, particularly the law codified in relevant
international conventions); whereby the meaning and interpretation of relevant provisions is
determined through examining secondary sources, namely the jurisprudence of relevant
judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, and the discussions of highly qualified academics (as
subsidiary means for determining the rules of law). The relationship between relevant legal
rules and principles is analysed, with the aim of solving the aforementioned ambiguities in
the existing law, and exposing what the law is in the studied area.

The primary legal sources used are the ECHR and the ICCPR. Death penalty-related
additional protocols of the respective conventions are also analysed, as they codify crucial
international law for the question at hand.

As the text of the Charter of Fundamental Rights

of the European Union (“the EU Charter”) is, by reason of being a younger instrument, in
17

See Resolution 2178, adopted by the United Nations Security Council, S/RES/2178, 24 September 2014.
“Foreign Terrorist Fighters” defined as “...individuals who travel to a State other than their State of residence or
nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the
providing or receiving of terrorist training, including in connection with armed conflict.”

conformity with the ECHR position on this matter (as a manifestation of the more modern
view of European states), and it is only applicable when European Union (“EU”) law is being
applied, the EU Charter will only be used to emphasise the existence of European consensus
on death penalty abolition and the prohibition of extradition where there is risk of capital
punishment. When parallels are being drawn between complicity in torture and complicity in
death penalty, this study also analyses aspects of the Convention Against Torture and Other
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”).

While analysis of the ICCPR in this study is relevant from a global perspective (owing to the
content and vast global ratification of the ICCPR), the ECHR’s relevance is limited to
Council of Europe (“CoE”) Member States (thus it is only relevant from the regional
perspective of Europe). The reason this thesis also examines the regional perspective of
Europe in this regard it threefold: 1) out of the regional human rights systems, Europe is the
only wholly death penalty abolitionist region (with the exception of Belarus, which is not a
Member State of the CoE),18 whereby the question of non-facilitation of death penalty arises
more frequently in the European context; 2) capital punishment contravenes the ECHR, 19
whereas it does not, in and of itself, contravene other overarching regional human rights
conventions (but for the aforementioned EU Charter, also relevant only from a European
perspective); 3) lending to points 1 and 2, there is significant jurisprudence of the European
Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) which very applicable and useful for the question of this
study (regarding non-facilitation of capital punishment, prohibition of extradition to face the
death penalty and so on), and this jurisprudence is applicable to the region of Europe as a
whole.

To provide authoritative interpretation to the relevant ECHR and ICCPR rights, this study
analyses secondary sources, most notably, jurisprudence of the ECtHR and of the Human
Rights Committee (“HRC”).

Only leading or otherwise notable cases in the relevant areas

are analysed, due to the large body of case law of both the ECtHR and HRC. This includes,
but is not limited to, jurisprudence establishing the ECHR and HRC’s positions on the death
penalty, cases outlining (and providing a rationale for) the prohibition of extradition to States
where there is risk of imposition of death penalty, and cases establishing and widening the

scope of the respective conventions extraterritorial protective ambit. The HRC’s General
Comments are also utilised, as they are authoritative and comprehensive interpretations of
substantive ICCPR rights and ICCPR State Party obligations.

The International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Articles on the Responsibility of States for
Unlawful Acts (“ILC Articles”) will also be analysed in this study. The legal status of these
Articles is unresolved in the international community, some suggesting they are secondary
sources or evidence of law, while others arguing they represent customary law (which would
make them a primary source of law as per Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International
Court of Justice).20 The ILC Articles have not been transformed into a convention, rather the
document was drafted and adopted by the ILC, and then adopted as a resolution of the United
Nations (“UN”) General Assembly (“UNGA”). However, the ILC Articles “are extensively
used and quoted in international practice and [in] the jurisprudence of national and
international tribunals”, 21 and “referred to in arguments before international tribunals, in
arbitral decisions, in state practice and in separate opinions of the International [Criminal]
Court”.22 The position adopted in this study is that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
are not a “source of law”, and rather are “evidence of a source of law”. 23 While they may
not be primary rules, the Articles on State Responsibility and the ILC Commentary are highly
authoritative sources in terms of the establishment of State responsibility. This lends to the
authoritative nature of both the ILC and the UNGA, 24 the elaborate process through which
the Articles were drafted and adopted, 25 and the extensive use of the Articles before
international courts, tribunals and general international practice.

For further interpretive aid, this study utilises academic discussions located in relevant

journal articles and textbooks (as secondary sources) regarding State responsibility for
internationally wrongful acts, the law on complicity, applicable ECtHR and HRC
jurisprudence, and questions of jurisdiction. The UK domestic decisions regarding Maha
Elgizouli are only analysed insofar as demonstrating the legal issue.

1.4.

Limitations

Provision of MLA in the context of this study is only one way that abolitionist States may be
said to facilitate the extraterritorial use of the death penalty. There are several other ways
that abolitionist States’ actions may be argued to contribute to the death penalty, including,
but not limited to, police-to-police assistance (where police force of one State aid the police
force of another State), provision of funds and other resources to tackle transnational crimes
like drug trafficking, provision of materials that are used in executions, provision of financial,
technical and other forms of support to strengthen foreign legal systems and so on. 26
However, in order to maintain sufficient thematic focus, this study analyses facilitation of
death penalty solely from the perspective of provision of MLA. This is also due to the
author’s view that out of the above given examples, provision of MLA in criminal
proceedings that may result in the death penalty is a form of assistance most proximate to the
prohibited conduct (judicial execution). Many of the arguments forwarded in this study may
also be relevant for other forms of death penalty facilitation.

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the legal status of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
is unconfirmed. However, this thesis will not delve into the discussion regarding the
authoritative status of the ILC Articles, as the question is worthy of thorough analysis in its
own right. On a similar reasoning, this study will not analyse the difference between primary
rules of law and secondary rules of law in relation to the ILC Articles. While the topic is
interesting, in that the distinction between the concepts is often blurred, the discussion is not
directly relevant for the question of this thesis.

Furthermore, as referred to in the preceding paragraph, this study is predominantly focussed
on the ICCPR and the ECHR. While the question of non-facilitation of capital punishment is
26

Supra., (note 4), para. 7.

7

Aliina Vegar

also interesting from the perspective of the Inter-American and the African regional systems,
in order to maintain sufficient focus, this study limits its analysis to the stated conventions.

Finally, there is also growing argument that abolitionist States are legally obliged to assist
their nationals who are facing the death penalty abroad (that being that State discretion to
provide diplomatic protection to its nationals is tempered in cases involving abuses of
fundamental human rights, which capital punishment is increasingly being classified as).27 If
such an obligation exists, it may add weight to the argument that abolitionist States are
consequently also prohibited from providing MLA to assist in capital punishment, at least in
relation to their own current or former nationals. However, whether or not such an obligation
exists it is an elaborate question, which would require extensive research and analysis in its
own right. Thus, in order maintain sufficient focus, this study does not address this matter
any further.

2. The Obligation to Seek Assurances, and Withhold Assistance in the
Absence of Assurances: a Human Rights Perspective
Within the human rights framework, two multilateral human rights treaties that have wide
membership and lay out much relevant law for the case at hand are the ECHR28 and the
ICCPR.29

The legal norms within the ECHR and ICCPR, and the jurisprudence of their

monitoring bodies, are vital for the question of whether abolitionist States are obliged to
obtain assurances before providing MLA in foreign criminal proceedings that may result in
judicial execution. Specifically, case law relating to the right to life, 30 and the right to be free
from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,31 especially in the context
of extradition to face the death penalty, can be drawn on for the context of this study.

This chapter analyses relevant ICCPR and ECHR doctrine, exposing and examining how
these conventions may impose an obligation on abolitionist States to obtain death penalty
assurances before providing MLA in foreign proceedings that may result in the death penalty,
or withhold MLA in the absence of such assurances. The reader is alerted at this stage that
jurisdictional counter arguments exist, which will be comprehensively analysed in the
following chapter. The analysis of the present chapter is first and foremost relevant for
establishing primary responsibility of the abolitionist State (where breach of such an
obligation would entail the direct responsibility of the State in question, as opposed to
derivative responsibility for complicity).32 However, the discussions of this chapter are also
drawn on in Chapter 5, for analysis of the question of complicity in capital punishment.

2.1.

The ECHR and the ICCPR Positions on the Death Penalty

Both the ECHR and the ICCPR textually allow the death penalty as an express exception to
the right to life. 33

In the context of the ECHR, however, it is likely that the law within the

Council of Europe (“CoE”) framework has evolved as to prohibit the death penalty in all
circumstances. This follows from the fact that most State parties have ratified the optional
protocols to the ECHR abolishing the death penalty (first in peacetime, 34 and later in all
circumstances 35 ), and those States that have not ratified the relevant optional protocols 36
show consistent State practice in observing a moratorium on capital punishment. 37

Thus, in

Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, the ECtHR considered that these factors are “strongly
indicative that Article 2 has been amended as to prohibit the death penalty in all
circumstances.”38

The EU framework supports this position. Article 2 of the EU Charter provides that “No one
shall be condemned to the death penalty”. 39 The EU’s absolute opposition to death penalty
is also supported by other EU documents,40 including, among others, the 2013 EU Guidelines
on Death Penalty, which set out “strong and unequivocal opposition to the death penalty in
all times and in all circumstances”; 41 the 2016 EU Regulation 2016/2134, concerning trade in
certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or
33

ECHR Article 2(1) – “Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life
intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this
penalty is provided by law.”; ICCPR article 6(1) – “Every human being has the inherent right to life. This
right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” ICCPR, Article 6(2) – “In
countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposed only for the most
serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime and not contrary to
the provisions of the present Covenant”

degrading treatment or punishment (with a specific focus on the death sentence rather than
the generalised prohibition on inhumane treatment or torture); 42 and paragraph 71 of the
European Union’s Law Enforcement Directive, which obliges a data controller to “take into
account that the personal data will not be used to request, hand down or execute a death
penalty or any form of cruel and inhuman treatment” before providing/transferring data to a
foreign law enforcement authority. 43 Considering the positions of both the CoE and the EU
in this regard, it is now considered that the death penalty has been removed from the
European framework.44

Regarding the ICCPR, Article 6(1) protects the right to life, while Article 6(2) provides that
non-abolitionist States may, under strict circumstances, impose the death penalty. 45 It is
apparent from Article 6 that abolition is preferred.46 This is supported by the HRC General
Comment 6, in which the HRC provides that “abolition is desirable.” 47

Furthermore, the

Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR (“ICCPR OP 2”),48 “Aiming at the Abolition of the
Death Penalty”, provides that “No one within the jurisdiction of a State Party to the present
Protocol shall be executed,”49 and that “Each State Party shall take all measures to abolish the
death penalty within its jurisdiction.”50 Thus, State parties to ICCPR OP 2 are abolitionist
States, prohibited by the ICCPR from imposing judicial execution within their jurisdiction.

As mentioned above, both the ECHR and the ICCPR also codify the right to be free from
torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (ECHR Article 3, and ICCPR

Article 7). Originally the death penalty, in and of itself, was not found in either context to
constitute treatment contrary to the right to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. Rather, certain methods of execution and death row conditions
were deemed in both contexts to contradict ECHR Article 3 and ICCPR Article 7. 51
However, as discussed at 2.2.2.1. and 2.2.2.2. below, the law has since developed to consider
that extradition to face the death penalty in and of itself constitutes treatment contrary to the
right to be free from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in both
contexts.

2.2.

Prohibition of Extradition Without Obtaining Death Penalty Assurances

Both the ECHR and the ICCPR protective ambits have evolved to prohibit abolitionist States
from extraditing individuals where there is a real risk of facing the death penalty in foreign
States (without having obtained appropriate death penalty assurances).

This is so, despite a

lack of express prohibition to that effect in either convention.

2.2.1. When There Was No Obligation to Refuse Extradition

In the early 1990s, there was no specific legal obligation on abolitionist States to refuse
extradition to retentionist States to face judicial execution. 52 In the ECHR context, this was
clear from the case, Soering v the UK, 53 where the applicant argued that his proposed
extradition to the US would violate his rights under the ECHR, as it would expose him to a
real risk of being subjected to the death penalty. While the ECtHR did find that the UK was
prohibited from extraditing Soering, it was not based on a finding that extradition would
violate his right to life, as Article 2(2) explicitly allows for death penalty. Rather, they relied
51

For ECHR, see e.g. Soering v the United Kingdom, European Court of Human Rights, Judgment of 7 July
1989, Application No. 1438/88 – which established the non-refoulement principle in the ECHR (derived from
Article 3). In this case, extradition was not permitted on the grounds that the long wait on death row would
amount to treatment contrary to ECHR Article 3, due to the associated fear, uncertainty and human anguish;
For ICCPR, see e.g. Francis v Jamaica, Human Rights Committee, Views adopted 3 August 1995,
Communication No. 606/1994, paras. 91-92 – where the Applicant’s long wait on death row and associated
deterioration of the Applicant’s mental state (satisfying the requirement for “further compelling circumstances”
for finding violation), was found to be treatment contrary to ICCPR Article 7.

on the conditions and manner in which the death penalty would occur, whereby the risk of
suffering the “death row phenomenon” while awaiting execution was found to be treatment
contrary to Article 3.54 Thus, during this time, if there were no aggravating factors igniting
Article 3 (like the “death row phenomenon”), extradition to face the death penalty was
permissible for CoE member States.

During this time, the ICCPR approach was similar. In Kindler v Canada,55 the HRC upheld
the Canadian Supreme Court decision that the risk of death penalty did not in and of itself
oblige Canada to refuse extradition in the absence of death penalty assurances. 56 The HRC
elaborated that Canada had no duty to demand death penalty assurances in the case.57

2.2.2. The Obligation to Refuse Extradition

2.2.2.1. The ECHR and the EU Charter

Regarding the ECHR, the law concerning extradition to face ECHR-contrary treatment has
since developed, leading to the widely accepted position that the ECHR now prohibits
contracting States from extraditing or otherwise expelling individuals to face the death
penalty in retentionist States. This prohibition is no longer dependent on the death-row
phenomenon, nor the manner or conditions of detainment constituting treatment contrary to
ECHR Article 3. The ECtHR has found that extradition to face the death penalty itself
violates ECHR Article 3,58 as well as Article 2.59 The ECtHR’s conclusion that the death
penalty itself violates Article 3 can be seen in the aforementioned case Al-Saadoon and

addition, the foreknowledge of death at the hands of the State must inevitably give rise to intense psychological
suffering.”; see also supra., (note 37), Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, para. 144, where the ECtHR found
that, regardless of eventual result, the applicants had been subjected “to the fear of execution by the Iraqi
authorities.” This alone amounted to psychological suffering to the nature and degree required to contravene
ECHR Article 3.

Mufdhi v the UK, where the ECtHR concluded that “the death penalty, which involved the
deliberate and premeditated destruction of a human being by the State authorities,
causing physical pain and intense psychological suffering as a result of the foreknowledge of
death, could be considered inhuman and degrading and, as such, contrary to Article 3 of the
Convention.”60

In Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, where the ECtHR also accepted that State practice is
likely to have amended Article 2 to prohibit death penalty in all circumstances, 61 the ECtHR
was asked to consider the legal ramifications of the transfer of prisoners to stand trial in Iraq.
The ECtHR found that the transfer presented real risk of the applicants being subjected to
capital punishment, and found that “Article 2 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.
13 prohibit the extradition or deportation of an individual to another State where substantial
grounds have been shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk of being
subjected to the death penalty there.”62 The ECtHR stated that:
“[T]he Court considers that, in the absence of any such binding assurance, the referral
of the applicants’ cases to the Iraqi courts and their physical transfer to the custody of
the Iraqi authorities failed to take proper account of the United Kingdom’s obligations
under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.
13 since, throughout the period in question, there were substantial grounds for
believing that the applicants would face a real risk of being sentenced to death and
executed.”63
In Al Nashiri v Poland, concerning unlawful rendition, the ECtHR found that Poland’s
assistance in the applicant’s transfer from Poland to the US violated both Article 2 and 3 of
the ECHR, due to the real and foreseeable risk that the applicant would be exposed to capital
punishment in the US. In arriving at this conclusion, the ECtHR provided that: “Article 2 of
the Convention prohibits the extradition or deportation of an individual to another State
where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk
of being subjected to the death penalty there.” 64 The ECtHR reiterated this position in F.G. v
Sweden, and found, due to risk of capital punishment, Sweden would be in violation of both

same facts constituted a violation of Article 2 (see paras. 144-145 of judgment).

Articles 2 and 3 if they returned the applicant to Iran without an ex nuc assessment by the
Swedish authorities of the consequences of this action. In coming to this conclusion, the
ECtHR stated that:
“At the outset the Court observes that in the context of expulsion, where there are
substantial grounds to believe that the person in question, if expelled, would face a
real risk of capital punishment, torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment in the destination country, both Articles 2 and 3 imply that the
Contracting State must not expel that person.”65

Thus, despite the absence of a provision to this effect, it is now widely accepted that the
ECHR prohibits contracting States from extraditing or otherwise expelling individuals where
there are substantial grounds for believing that the individual would face a real risk of being
subjected to the death penalty.

If an individual were to be extradited or expelled in such

circumstances, this conduct would contradict both Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR. Extradition
may only be permissible in such circumstances upon obtaining assurances from the receiving
State that the death penalty will not be imposed. 66

Again, the EU framework supports this legal position. Article 19(2) of the EU Charter, as a
younger instrument, textually reflects this evolved legal perspective. The EU Charter
explicitly provides that in the EU Member States, “No one may be removed, expelled or
extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the
death penalty […]”67

2.2.2.2. The ICCPR

This approach has also been followed by the HRC. While the ICCPR textually allows for
death penalty under certain strict circumstances (as discussed above), and does not expressly
prohibit extradition to face the death penalty in foreign States, the law has evolved to reflect
the CoE and EU positions outlined above (in respect of abolitionist State parties).

The HRC reversed its decision in Kindler v Canada, in the case Judge v Canada.68 In Judge
v Canada, the HRC reflected that “there has been a broadening international consensus in
favour of abolition of the death penalty”, 69 meaning that “[f]or countries that have abolished
the death penalty, there is an obligation not to expose a person to the real risk of its
application.”70

In Judge v Canada, the HRC recognised that if an abolitionist State exposed

an individual to risk of death penalty in that manner, it would violate the right to life under
the ICCPR.71 This is an important development as previously the HRC had only prevented
extradition/expulsion when it considered the circumstances or manner of execution to
contradict ICCPR Article 7.72

In coming to the conclusion that extradition in such circumstances could violate Article 6, the
HRC stated that: “[f]or countries that have abolished the death penalty, […] they may not
remove, either by deportation or extradition, individuals from their jurisdiction if it may be
reasonably anticipated that they will be sentenced to death, without ensuring that the death
sentence would not be carried out.”73

Similarly, the HRC has found that extradition/expulsion in circumstances where an individual
is exposed to real risk of capital punishment in and of itself contravenes ICCPR Article 7
(thus without needing to argue that the manner of execution or conditions on death row
constitutes Article 7-contrary treatment). This is reflected in Yin Fong v Australia, where the
HRC stated it was aware of the stress and anxiety that would be caused for an individual
exposed to the risk of capital punishment.74 The HRC found that, in the event that Australia
forcibly removed the author without adequate assurances, the risk of capital punishment
alone constituted violation of the author’s rights under Article 7,75 (without discussion on the
death row circumstances or methods of execution). In this case, the HRC also found that the
Article 6 right to life would be violated in these circumstances. 76

Thus, it is now accepted that ICCPR contracting States are prohibited from extraditing
individuals where there is risk of being subjected to the death penalty; and to do so without
death penalty assurances would contradict ICCPR Article 6 and/or Article 7. This position is
emphasised in HRC General Comments. In General Comment 31, the HRC provides that:

“[…] the article 2 obligation requiring that States Parties respect and ensure the
Covenant rights for all persons in their territory and all persons under their control
entails an obligation not to extradite, deport, expel or otherwise remove a person from
their territory, where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk
of irreparable harm, such as that contemplated by articles 6 and 7 of the Covenant,
either in the country to which removal is to be effected or in any country to which the
person may subsequently be removed.” 77
A more recent General Comment elaborates on this position. In General Comment 36, the
HRC provides that: “The duty to respect and ensure the right to life requires States parties to
refrain from deporting, extraditing or otherwise transferring individuals to countries in which
there are substantial grounds for believing that a real risk exists that their right to life under
article 6 of the Covenant would be violated.”78 Furthermore, “[…] it would be contrary to
article 6 to extradite an individual from a country that abolished the death penalty to a
country in which he or she may face the death penalty.” 79 Moreover:

“States parties that abolished the death penalty cannot deport, extradite or otherwise
transfer persons to a country in which they are facing criminal charges that carry the
death penalty, unless credible and effective assurances against the imposition of the death
penalty have been obtained. In the same vein, the obligation not to reintroduce the death
penalty for any specific crime requires States parties not to deport, extradite or otherwise
transfer an individual to a country in which he or she is expected to stand trial for a
capital offence, if the same offence does not carry the death penalty in the removing
State, unless credible and effective assurances against exposing the individual to the death
penalty have been obtained.” 80
Thus, it is clear that abolitionist States who are party to the ICCPR are prohibited from
extraditing individuals to face the death penalty in foreign States. This prohibition is so for
all ICCPR State parties who have abolished the death penalty, not only for those abolitionist

States who have ratified ICCPR OP 2.81

Extradition would only be permissible in such

circumstances on obtaining assurances from the receiving State that the death penalty will not
be imposed. 82

2.3.

Rationale Behind the Legal Obligation to Withhold Assistance in the Absence of

Death Penalty Assurances

The scope and manner of the obligation not to extradite individuals to face execution “has
ramifications for the argument that abolitionist States are obliged to refrain from assisting the
use of the death penalty in other ways.” 83

There are many parallels that can be drawn

between the ECtHR and HRC’s rationales to broaden their respective convention’s protective
ambits to cover extradition cases and the provision of MLA to foreign retentionist States in
the context of this study. As extradition can even be argued to be a type of MLA, 84 it would
seem logical that abolitionist States should thus also refuse the provision of MLA without
death penalty assurances. This study respectfully submits that the UK Queen’s Bench and
the majority in the Supreme Court were incorrect in their findings in Maha Elgizouli that
there is no human rights obligation requiring the UK to withhold provision of MLA where
there is a risk that this would lead to imposition of the death penalty. “While States must be
able to assist each other in the fight against crime, the prohibition and opposition of the death
penalty is not something that can be set aside for the sake of convenience.”85

81

Supra., (note 68), Judge v Canada, para. 10.6: “For these reasons, the Committee considers that Canada, as a
State party which has abolished the death penalty, irrespective of whether it has not yet ratified the Second
Optional Protocol to the Covenant Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty, violated the author’s right to
life under article 6, paragraph 1, by deporting him to the United States, where he is under sentence of death,
without ensuring that the death penalty would not be carried out.” (italics added).

Covenant.” (emphasis added).

2.3.1. The Underlying Principle of Non-Facilitation

In demonstrating that ECHR and ICCPR protection covers extradition cases, both the ECt
and the HRC have relied on the principle of “non-facilitation” of the death penalty (and thus,
similar to the concept of prohibition of complicity in convention-contrary conduct). This
results from a clear conflict if States were permitted to be instrumental in the foreseeable
human rights abuses of other States.86

In the ECHR context, one of the underlying rationales behind the ECtHR’s decision to
prohibit extradition in these circumstances is the reality that the contracting State would be
facilitating the unacceptable outcome, 87 (i.e. facilitating the death penalty).

This was first

established in Soering, where the ECtHR held that “liability [under the ECHR] is incurred by
the extraditing Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which has a direct
consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment.”88

This underlying

principle has subsequently been reaffirmed and endorsed by the ECtHR in a number of
cases, 89 and thus provided the rationale to broaden the protective ambit of the ECHR to
prohibit extradition/expulsion from a contracting State to face the death penalty in a noncontracting State.

In another UK domestic case, R (Ismail) v Secretary of State for the Home Department,90 the
UK Supreme Court concluded that the decision in Soering was based on the fact of UK’s
facilitation of treatment contrary to ECHR Article 3 by the US: “It was because the actions of
the UK authorities […] facilitated that outcome that a violation of article 3 was held to be

The Queen’s Bench in Maha Elgizouli accepted that the non-facilitation principle existed as the rationale to
prohibit extradition in such circumstances, however, the Court did not accept that it could be extended to the
provision of MLA, see supra., (note 8) Maha Elgizouli (QB case), paras. 66, 55.

present. In effect, the UK would have been directly instrumental to exposing Soering to the
risk of being executed.”91

The HRC has used the same rationale in its cases regarding extradition to face death penalty.
For example, in Judge v Canada, the HRC found that Canada had violated the author’s right
to life by extraditing him to the US to face the death penalty without obtaining requisite
assurances: “The Committee recognizes that Canada did not itself impose the death penalty
on the author. But by deporting him to a country where he was under sentence of death,
Canada established the crucial link in the causal chain that would make possible the
execution of the author.”92

Another example from a national setting, which is relevant for this discussion, is a South
African Constitutional Court Case, Mohamed v President of the Republic of South Africa.93
In this case, the court looked at the causal connection to execution in extradition cases, and
thus identified a principle of non-facilitation to justify refusing to extradite without
appropriate death penalty assurances. The court stated that there was a “commitment implicit
in the Constitution that South Africa will not be party to the imposition of cruel, inhuman or
degrading punishment”.94 The appellant used the language of the HRC in Judge v Canada,
stating that what matters is whether the State has “established the crucial link in the chain that
would make possible the execution of the author.”95

Turning to the legal question of this study, the act of providing MLA for use in foreign
criminal proceedings, where prosecution may result in judicial execution, clearly also has the
direct consequence of exposing the individual in question to treatment prohibited for
abolitionists States by the ECHR and the ICCPR. The action of the authorities who provide
or authorise the provision of MLA facilitates an outcome that contravenes ECHR and ICCPR
rights to life and rights to be free from torture or inhumane treatment, as provision of such
assistance is “directly instrumental” to exposing the individual in question to the risk of
capital punishment.

As discussed in the minority judgment of Lord Kerr in the Maha Elgizouli Supreme Court
case, there is a “fundamental illogicality of, on the one hand, refusing to extradite or deport
individuals for trial in a foreign state where there was a risk of the imposition of the death
penalty, without requisite assurances, and, on the other hand, facilitating such a trial when
precisely the same outcome is in prospect without demanding assurances.” 96 The irrationality
of taking a different approach in these two very similar circumstances is also illustrated by
Christof Heyns (a former UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions, and current member of the HRC):
“A dilemma emerges when abolitionist states provide assistance to retentionist states
in criminal matters and that assistance leads to the use of the death penalty. Even
though the individual facing the death penalty in such cases may never have been in
the jurisdiction of the abolitionist state, such assistance could amount to complicity in
the death penalty. The same legal principles apply here as in the case of transfer of
persons: states that have abolished capital punishment may not assist in bringing
about the death penalty in other countries.” 97
Thus, such rationale that prohibits extradition to face the death penalty, should not logically
be confined only to extradition cases. “[I]f it is objectionable to be complicit in exposing an
individual to the risk of execution by extraditing him, it is surely equally objectionable to be
complicit in facilitating that result by providing material which has the same result.”98

2.3.2. Opposition to the Death Penalty in “All Circumstances”: CoE and EU
Member States

As discussed earlier, ECHR Protocol 13 abolished the death penalty “in all circumstances”
for its State parties. No derogations or reservations can be made from the absolute
prohibition. 99 The ECtHR’s discussion of the nature and extent of ECHR Protocol 13 in the
case Alsaadoon v Mufhdi, is relevant for the argument that the non-facilitation principle
extends to death penalty as a consequence of the provision of MLA:

“The court takes as its starting point the nature of the right not to be subjected to the
death penalty. Judicial execution involves the deliberate and premeditated destruction
of a human being by the state authorities. Whatever the method of execution, the
extinction of life involves some physical pain. In addition, the foreknowledge of death
at the hands of the state must inevitably give rise to intense psychological suffering.
The fact that the imposition and use of the death penalty negates fundamental human
rights has been recognised by the member states of the Council of Europe. In the
preamble to Protocol No 13 the Contracting States describe themselves as ‘convinced
that everyone’s right to life is a basic value in a democratic society and that the
abolition of the death penalty is essential for the protection of this right and for the
full recognition of the inherent dignity of all human beings’” 100
“The court considers that, in respect of those states which are bound by it, the right
under article 1 of Protocol No 13 not to be subjected to the death penalty, which
admits of no derogation and applies in all circumstances, ranks along with the rights
in articles 2 and 3 as a fundamental right, enshrining one of the basic values of the
democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. As such, its provisions must
be strictly construed.”101
The ECtHR’s discussion outlined above recognises the comprehensive reach of ECHR
Protocol 13, whereby it applies in all circumstances, and no derogations or reservations are
permitted. Furthermore, the passage frames the prohibition of death penalty as a fundamental
right (classing it alongside ECHR Articles 2 and 3).

ECtHR jurisprudence and ECHR

Protocol 13 demonstrate “the almost complete ubiquity of opposition in the countries which
compromise the Council of Europe to the imposition of the death penalty in any
circumstances”. 102 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the EU can also be argued to unmistakably
oppose the death penalty in every circumstance. 103

The argument that the EU and CoE are strongly opposed to judicial execution, including
indirect application of the death penalty, is supported by a Joint Declaration of the EU and
CoE in 2018, which provides that:
“On the European and World Day against the Death Penalty, the Council of Europe
and the European Union (EU) reiterate their strong opposition to capital punishment
in all circumstances and for all cases. The death penalty is an affront to human
dignity. It constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and is contrary to the
right to life. The death penalty has no established deterrent effect and it makes judicial
errors irreversible […] Member states should continue taking effective measures to

prevent their involvement, however indirect, in the use of the death penalty by third
countries, such as by adopting measures that prevent the trade in goods that could
subsequently be used to carry out executions […]”104
Thus, the CoE and EU Member State abhorrence to the death penalty, accompanied by the
prohibition on facilitating death penalty through extradition, significantly support the
argument that facilitating the same sentence through the provision MLA should also be
prohibited for Member States of the CoE and the EU.

2.3.3. Prohibition of Reintroduction of the Death Penalty

Looking primarily at the ICCPR context, ICCPR OP 2 (like the ICCPR itself) “does not
contain termination provisions and States parties cannot denounce it.”105 Thus, abolition of
the death penalty cannot legally be revoked, and the death penalty may not be
reintroduced.106 As provided by the HRC in General Comment 36:
“[t]he obligation not to reintroduce the death penalty for any specific crime requires
States parties not to deport, extradite or otherwise transfer an individual to a country
in which he or she is expected to stand trial for a capital offence, if the same offence
does not carry the death penalty in the removing State, unless credible and effective
assurances against exposing the individual to the death penalty have been
obtained.”107
The facilitation of the death penalty in foreign States by abolitionist States in some respects
reintroduces the abolished sentence for that State. In the ICCPR context, this rationale was
used to argue for the prohibition extradition to face the death penalty. For example, in a
minority judgment in the case Cox v Canada, 108 (which was decided before ICCPR law
developed to prohibit extradition to face the death penalty), the committee member argued
that extradition would violate Article 7:
“The argument was based on the presumption that abolitionist states are under
obligation to ensure that the scope of the death penalty is not enlarged or

reintroduced. The obligation extends to indirect reintroduction – through extradition,
expulsion or compulsory return, in such a way that an individual […] may be exposed
to capital punishment in another state.”109
Thus, a similar argument can be forwarded for the topic of this study. The provision of MLA
in circumstances that may result in judicial execution enlarges the scope of the death penalty,
effectively reintroducing it for the assistance-sending State, despite the irrevocable
undertaking to prohibit and not reintroduce the death penalty.

2.3.4. Evolutive Interpretation of the ECHR and the ICCPR

2.3.4.1.

Object and Purpose

In justification of the expansion of ECHR protection to establish State party jurisdiction in
extradition cases, the ECtHR has relied on interpreting the ECHR in light of its object and
purpose. The ECtHR has expanded the protective ambit of the ECHR in this way in the
context of other rights also, relying on a purposive construction of ECHR rights. In Soering,
the ECtHR stated that “It would hardly be compatible with the underlying values of the
Convention […] were a Contracting State knowingly to surrender a fugitive to another State
where there were substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being
subjected to torture, however heinous the crime allegedly committed. Extradition in such
circumstances […] would plainly be contrary to the spirit and intendement of the
[ECHR]”.110

This is so in the ICCPR context also. The object and purpose of the ICCPR is reflected in the
text of the convention, as an instrument for the protection and recognition of human rights:
“Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all
individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the
present Covenant […]”111 The HRC has also expanded protection to cover extradition cases,
relying on the object and purpose of the ICCPR: “[The HRC] is moving towards
strengthening the obligations of abolitionist states and, in so doing, restricting the availability

111

110

24

Aliina Vegar

of the sanction [of the death penalty] for retentionist states. This is consistent with the object
and purposes approach.”112

Such reasoning is also valid for the provision of MLA in the circumstances of this study. It
would be equally inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ECHR and the ICCPR were
abolitionist States permitted to provide MLA for use in criminal proceedings where
prosecution may result in death penalty, when the death penalty is prohibited for those States.
It would thus contravene the underlying values of the conventions if abolitionist State parties
were permitted to facilitate death penalty in foreign States in this manner. Provision of MLA
in these circumstances would “plainly be contrary to the spirit and intendenment” 113 of the
ECHR and ICCPR (and their death penalty prohibiting additional protocols).

2.3.4.2. Convention Rights to be Practical and Effective

From early on, the ECtHR has also emphasised the requirement that ECHR rights be
“practical and effective” as opposed to “theoretical an illusory”. 114 This reasoning was also
used by the ECtHR in its’ expansion of the ECHR’s extraterritorial applicability in
extradition cases. In Soering, the ECtHR provided that: “the object and purpose of the
Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings require that its
provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective.”115
The ECHR is an instrument intended to be protect rights in a practical and effective manner.
Prohibition of extradition to face the death penalty was thus required, to ensure that the
safeguards codified in the ECHR were effective, not merely theoretical.

The HRC has also highlighted the need for the practical and effective enjoyment of ICCPR
rights, using the same wording as that used by the ECtHR. For example, the case Kennedy v
Trinidad and Tobago concerned, among other matters, the right of any one sentenced to
death to seek pardon (within the Article 6 right to life). 116 The HRC stated that: “the right to

apply for mercy under article 6, paragraph 4, must be interpreted to be an effective right, i.e.
it must be construed in such a way that it is practical and effective rather than theoretical or
illusory.” 117 Thus, the ICCPR also obliges States to “ensure the effective and practical
enjoyment of ICCPR rights.”118

Turning to the question of the present study, in order for the right to life and the right to be
free from torture or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment to be “practical and
effective”, State party facilitation of judicial execution (by way of provision of MLA in
foreign criminal proceedings) must, surely, be prohibited by the ECHR and the ICCPR. If
provision of MLA under such circumstances were permissible, it would render aspects of
ECHR and ICCPR safeguards ineffective and illusory.

2.3.4.3. Living Instruments

Furthermore, the development of the ECHR and ICCPR prohibition of extradition to face the
death penalty is an example of how both conventions are “living instruments”.

The HRC

and the ECtHR have widened the scope of their respective conventions to cover subject
matter that was not in the mind of the drafters, to reflect and respond to society’s
contemporary views and needs. This is because these conventions are living instruments and
need to be “interpreted in light of present-day conditions”.119

This doctrine has been used in the context of extradition to face convention-contrary
treatment. For example, in the aforementioned case, Judge v Canada, the HRC looked at the
practice of its State parties (of seeking assurances before extraditing individuals to face
capital charges): “[o]ther abolitionist countries do not, in general, extradite without

26

assurances.”120 The HRC then came to the conclusion that Canada had violated the author’s
right to life by extraditing him to the US to face the death penalty without obtaining requisite
assurances, as the ICCPR had developed to reflect this legal reality: “The Committee
considers that the Covenant should be interpreted as a living instrument and the rights
protected under it should be applied in context and in the light of present–day conditions.”121

This “living instrument” doctrine can be applied to the circumstances of the present study. In
doing so, the following statement by Lord Kerr in the Supreme Court judgment of Maha
Elgizouli is relevant:
“Law, [...] if it is operating as it should, must be responsive to society’s contemporary
needs, standards and values. It is a commonplace that these are in a state of constant
change. […] I am convinced that the adjustment to the common law which I propose
[prohibiting the provision of MLA for proceedings which may result in death penalty]
reflects the contemporary standards and values of our society.”122
This study strongly agrees with Lord Kerr’s statement above. Obliging States to withhold
MLA in the absence of adequate death penalty assurances reflects the contemporary needs,
standards and values of present day society (evidenced, for example, by the aforementioned
parallels between providing MLA and the prohibition of extradition to face the death penalty,
and, especially for the European context, the opposition of the CoE and EU to the death
penalty).

This study submits that the evolution of the ECHR and the ICCPR to prohibit

abolitionist States from providing such assistance without requisite assurances is merely an
incremental step, and is inline with the status of both conventions as living instruments.

2.4.

ICCPR and ECHR State Parties

As asserted in this chapter, the ICCPR and the ECHR may impose an obligation on
abolitionist States to seek assurances that the death penalty will not be imposed before
providing MLA for use in foreign criminal proceedings which may result in death penalty,
and an obligation to withhold such assistance in the absence of adequate assurances.

With

respect to which States such an obligation effects, as outlined in this chapter, it is likely that

121

27

Aliina Vegar

the law within the CoE human rights framework (i.e. through the ECHR) has developed so as
to prohibit the death penalty for its member States in all circumstances,123 and that the ECHR
now prohibits all contracting States from extraditing or expelling individuals to face the death
penalty in retentionist States.124 Thus, the obligation to withhold assistance in the absence of
death penalty assurances in the context of this study, would similarly apply to all ECHR
contracting States.125

For non-European/non-ECHR contracting States, those abolitionist States who have ratified
the ICCPR would also be under a legal obligation to withhold MLA in the absence of
requisite assurances in the context of this study. As with extradition, this obligation would be
so for all ICCPR State parties who have abolished the death penalty, not only for those
abolitionist States who have ratified ICCPR OP 2.126

States not party to ECHR or ICCPR, or ICCPR State parties who have not abolished the
death penalty, would not be impacted by such international obligations stemming from these
instruments.127

For those abolitionist States party to both the ICCPR and the ECHR, the

more desirable complaints mechanism to bring such a case is the ECtHR. The ECtHR is a
judicial body that provides legally binding judgements, 128 whereas the HRC is quasi-judicial,
whereby its Views are recommendatory in nature (although still very authoritative).129

3. The Issue of Jurisdiction
Contracting States have a jurisdictionally qualified obligation to provide and protect the
human rights codified in the ECHR and the ICCPR (i.e. the engagement undertaken by each
State is confined to ensuring and protecting rights of those individuals within the State’s
jurisdiction). 130

The provision of MLA in foreign criminal proceedings thus raises

potentially difficult questions relating to jurisdiction, as the individual in question (who may
be facing the death penalty) is not, and perhaps never was, in the territorial jurisdiction of the
assistance-providing State.

It is worth underscoring here, that the general rule is that ‘aliens’ are subject to the
jurisdiction of the host state. 131 Thus, States exercising jurisdiction beyond their own
territorial borders into another State’s territorial jurisdiction can actually be argued to
interfere with the exclusive territorial jurisdiction of the host State. 132

However, the

territorial jurisdiction of the host State is somewhat moderated by human rights obligations of
other States, to the extent that they extend beyond national borders. Thus, in the context of
this study, in order to establish a duty on States to seek assurances, and withhold assistance in
the absence of assurances, it must be established that State parties to the ECHR and the
ICCPR owe, to some degree, extraterritorial obligations to the individuals to whom the
foreign criminal proceedings concern. This is a question of jurisdiction.

An argument forwarded by Lorraine Finlay (regarding provision of MLA by Australia in
potential death penalty cases) discusses the phrase “within the jurisdiction” of a State party,
in reference to ICCPR OP 2. She exemplifies how jurisdiction may present an obstacle for
the conclusions presented in the previous Chapter: “The wording of this article places a clear
and unambiguous jurisdictional limitation on the nature of the obligation. The article does not
impose an obligation on States not to expose a person to the real risk of the application of the

death penalty. Rather, the language expressly limits the obligation to the abolition of the
death penalty within the State's own jurisdiction.”133

3.1.

The Difference Between Extradition and MLA in Terms of Jurisdiction

Although extradition to face the death penalty, and the provision of MLA for proceedings
that may result in death penalty, have many obvious similarities (including the fact that both
may facilitate judicial execution in a foreign state), they are not identical fact scenarios from
a jurisdictional standpoint.

Regarding extradition, the individual is, at least originally, within the territorial jurisdiction of
the contracting State. The presence of the individual within the territory of the contracting
State means that an extraditing State has jurisdiction over the individual in question, owing to
the obvious link between the contracting State’s physical territory and the individual whose
rights are in question. Thus, “[j]urisdiction extends in these [extradition] cases […] because
the wrongful act […] is directly connected to the individual’s territorial presence in a
signatory state”,134 and thus the State is responsible for the conditions on which it forces the
individual to exit its borders.135

This connection between the physical territory of the State party and extraterritorial
jurisdiction in extradition cases is especially exemplified in pre-extradition/expulsion
cases, 136 as the individual is at all times within the contracting State’s physical territory, and
the harm prospective. 137 In reactive cases (where the contracting State has already expelled
or extradited the individual), the jurisdictional responsibility under Article 1 is incurred upon
the State party’s termination of territorial ties with the individual (which facilitates the
ensuing ECHR-contrary action). 138

Thus, in both circumstances, the connection to the

physical territory of the contracting party is clear, whereby it can be argued that “the
extraterritorial acts are so foreseeably and inextricably linked to the individual’s [current or
former] presence in the state’s territory that they become within the state’s jurisdiction.” 139

Conversely, regarding the provision of MLA for use in foreign criminal proceedings that may
result in death penalty, the individual to whom the criminal investigation and proceeding
concerns may have never stepped within the State party’s territorial borders. The potential
for absence of any past, present or future territorial ties with the MLA-providing State is a
distinction between extradition and provision of MLA, which may make it more difficult to
establish State party jurisdiction for the individual, when the adverse consequence is suffered
outside its borders.

The UK Queen’s Bench used similar arguments when they dismissed the claim in Maha
Elgizouli.140 The Queen’s Bench found that the extension of jurisdiction (and of the nonfacilitation principle) 141 to the provision of MLA under the circumstances of the case “is not
[…] a small step, but an extension of a large moment which has not been recognised […]
anywhere.”142 The Queen’s Bench stated that: “the claimant’s son is presently held in Syria,
outside the jurisdiction of this court”, “the ECHR has no direct application to him”, and
jurisdiction of the ECHR does not “stretch as far” as the individual to which the criminal
proceedings concern. 143

3.2.

Extraterritorial Jurisdiction of the ECHR and the ICCPR

The ECHR and the ICCPR do have extraterritorial reach, to some degree. However, “the
extent to which State parties owe their human rights obligations abroad remains uncertain.” 144
Extensive case law and academic literature demonstrates that there is an ever-increasing
extraterritorial scope under human rights conventions. 145

As noted in Soering v the UK, the ECHR “does not govern the actions of States not Parties to
it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention
standards on other States”.146

Despite this, it is clear that jurisdiction in the ECHR is no

longer considered to simply be a territorial notion.147 The ECHR has extraterritorial reach,
principally in two main categories: 1) circumstances where the State exerts effective control
over an area outside its territory;148 and 2) circumstances where State agent(s) exercise power
and control over an individual(s) (whereby the individual(s) thus falls within the jurisdiction
of the State). 149

As noted in Alskeini v UK, 150 this includes the important exception to

territorial jurisdiction – that a State has jurisdiction for acts committed extraterritorially,
when it exercises “public powers” on the territory of another State. 151 As stated by Bharat
Malkani, “[t]his illustrates a growing concern among the judiciary about the extraterritorial
abuse of Convention rights.”152

Turning to the ICCPR, similarly, the HRC “has long given extraterritorial effect to the
ICCPR.”153 The most comprehensive statement of the extraterritorial reach of the ICCPR by
the HRC was in its General Comment 31, where the HRC interpreted the obligation in Article
2(1) as obliging State parties to “secure the rights under the Covenant for all persons in their
territory and all persons under their control.” 154 The HRC went on to observe that a
contracting party’s duty to respect, protect and ensure rights to all persons subject to the
State’s jurisdiction includes “anyone within the power or effective control of the State Party,
even if not situated in the territory of the State Party […]. This Principle also applies to those
within the power or effective control of the forces of the State Party acting outside its
territory, regardless of the circumstances in which such power or effective control was

obtained”. 155

The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) confirms this position in an

Advisory Opinion of 2004,156 in which the ICJ rejected the argument that the ICCPR was not
applicable outside a contracting State’s territorial boundary. 157

The ICJ stated that the

ICCPR’s reach extends to “acts done by a State in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its
own territory”.158

3.3.

Rationale to Draw Jurisdictional Link in This Context

This study submits that, while the human rights framework analysed does not provide a
straightforward jurisdictional link, it may be that existing categories of extraterritorial
jurisdiction in the ICCPR and ECHR can be further defined to include the context of this
study.

3.3.1. The Decision to Provide Assistance Occurs Within the State’s Territorial
Jurisdiction

As outlined above, human rights obligations codified in the ICCPR and the ECHR can
extend, to some extent, beyond the State party’s territorial borders. However, as yet, neither
the ECtHR or HRC have analysed if the jurisdictional requirement can be satisfied in cases
concerning the provision of MLA in criminal proceedings that may result in judicial
execution, i.e. whether such circumstances “can be construed as the exercise of 'public
powers' as per the ECHR, or whether the person at risk of the death penalty in these types of
cases can be deemed to be 'within the power or effective control' of the abolitionist State as
per the ICCPR.”159

It can be argued that, in the circumstances of this study, the requirement of jurisdiction is
satisfied as the act that leads to the wrong (i.e. the act of providing MLA without death

penalty assurances (and the act of deciding to do so)) occurs within the territory and effective
control of the abolitionist State.160 Extradition cases are again of use for such an argument.
As stated in the textbook Jacobs, White, and Ovey: The European Convention on Human
Rights, in extradition cases under the ECHR, “liability under the Convention arises from the
decision to remove the person concerned from the territory of the Contracting State and
expose him to a risk of ill-treatment in the receiving country. The Contracting State is not
liable for what actually befalls the applicant once out of its territory […], but instead for
making the decision to expel him knowing that there was such a risk.” 161

Similarly, the

argument could be forwarded here, that liability under the ECHR occurs at the point of the
decision (which is made in the abolitionist State’s physical territory) to provide MLA without
requisite assurances, which thus exposes the person concerned to a risk of ill treatment in the
assistance-receiving State. However, as discussed in paragraph 3.1. above, there are factual
differences between extradition and provision of MLA which may be fatal to such an
argument (notably, the presence of the individual concerned in the territorial jurisdiction of
the abolitionist State).

3.3.2. Individual is within “the Power and Control” of the Abolitionist State, and
the Abolitionist State is Exercising “Public Powers”

However, there is definitely room to argue that in cases such as Maha Elgizouli, the State is
exercising power and control over the individual concerned, despite the individual not being
present in the State’s territorial borders, thus bringing the individual in question under the
jurisdiction of the abolitionist State. In the fact scenario of Maha Elgizouli, Mr El Sheikh (to
whom the proceedings concern) was a British citizen until the UK recently stripped him of
his citizenship. The UK has expressed desire to try him in its own territory, however, the
UK’s Crown Prosecution Service had determined that the evidence available was insufficient
to warrant charging him in its territory.162 As the UK considered it infeasible to prosecute
him in the UK, it decided to support prosecution of El Sheikh in the US instead: “the clear
view of the UK officials was that a prosecution of Mr El Sheikh in the US federal court

system, which included the UK evidence, represented the only realistic prospect of securing
justice”.163 This is despite the US being rather reluctant to take responsibility for the trial,
where the US “considered that the UK ought to set an example to the wider international
community by accepting responsibility for bringing foreign terrorist fighters such as Mr El
Sheikh […] to trial.” 164 Any prosecution of El Sheikh in the US “depends critically on the
evidence which has been obtained by the British authorities”. 165

This fact scenario shows an undeniable link between Mr El Sheikh and the UK. The US is,
more or less, trying El Sheikh on the UK’s behalf, as the evidence available was considered
insufficient to try him within the UK domestic judicial system.

Furthermore, the trial

depends significantly on UK evidence, whereby the absence of UK’s evidence renders
prosecution in the US is unlikely to succeed. In these circumstances, it is a flagrant denial of
fact to claim that El Sheikh, and the consequence of death penalty that may befall him, are
not inextricably connected to the UK. The UK is exercising public powers in the US through
this case, and exercising power and control over El Sheikh. As stated in Al-Skeini, “What is
decisive in such cases is the exercise of […] power and control over the person in
question.”166 The power and control that the UK is exercising over El Sheik thus provides
sound argument for drawing a jurisdiction link. Such an argument is supported by the fact
that the UK Supreme Court raised no jurisdictional arguments in the case (while in the
Queen’s Bench decision, jurisdiction was a significant factor for denying the applicability of
ECHR obligations).167

As stated by Robert Currie, in such cases “[i]t is arguable that the provision of MLA by the
requested State is an act of authority producing effects extraterritorially. The authorities are
certainly exercising jurisdiction over the essential legal interests of the person regardless of
their physical location.”168

While a specific jurisdictional conclusion to this effect is yet to

be drawn by the ECtHR or the HRC, this study submits that this is because such a case has
not appeared before either body. As stated in Jacobs, White, and Ovey: The European

Convention on Human Rights, “still further development of the definition of jurisdiction will
be necessary in future cases, particularly given the ever increasing involvement in
Contracting States in conflicts beyond there territorial borders.” 169

3.3.3. Jurisdictional Limits Need Not Be Determinative

It can also be argued that “the developing law on the scope of extraterritorial obligations
under human rights treaties suggests that the issue of jurisdictional limits need not be
determinative of the scope of abolitionist States' secondary obligations to refrain from
facilitating the use of the death penalty elsewhere.”170

This is exemplified by Robert Currie

in his discussion on one State providing evidence to another for use in an unfair trial: “To
provide evidence for use in a foreign criminal procedure that amounts to a "flagrant denial"
of fair trial rights, simply on the basis that "our human rights obligations don't cover the
accused," may render the requested State complicit in conduct which it has agreed to prohibit,
necessarily leaving a bad taste from a legal and moral standpoint.”171

The same argument can be forwarded in the context of this study also – where an abolitionist
State is knowingly facilitating conduct that it has legally bound itself to abstain from (i.e. the
death penalty), and chooses not to take steps to prevent it merely because of a jurisdictional
technicality, this leaves a questionable aftertaste. 172 Through the provision of MLA, the
assisting-State is participating in an invasive form of interaction between State and
individual, directly impacting the person’s legal interests.173

As such, the State should act in

accordance with its own human rights obligations, and not dispose of such obligations on a
mere technicality.

4. State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts
The law on state responsibility is outlined in the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”)
Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles” /
“Articles on State Responsibility”). 174 This is another requirement which needs to be
convincingly argued in order to establish abolitionist State responsibility for providing MLA
to death penalty retentionist States for use in criminal proceedings that may result in the death
penalty. 175

As referred to in “Method and Material” 176 and “Limitations”, 177 the legal status of the
Articles on State Responsibility is unresolved in the legal community. While this thesis will
not delve into discussion regarding the legal status of the ILC Articles, the position adopted
in this study is that they are highly authoritative in nature, and evidence of a source of law.

4.1.

Abolitionist State Responsibility for an Internationally Wrongful Act

Article 1 of the ILC Articles concisely provides that, “Every internationally wrongful act of a
State entails the international responsibility of that State”.178 Article 2 goes on to define the
conditions required to establish the existence of an internationally wrongful act, that being: 1)
the conduct (consisting of an action or omission) must be attributable to the State under
international law; and 2) for responsibility to be established, the conduct must constitute a

Note, however, that the ECtHR and the HRC frequently fail to mention the ILC Articles in their
jurisprudence, often following their own rules regarding the responsibility of States (even though the ILC
Articles should be relevant for their decisions). This will not be further discussed in the present study, but for
further discussion, see e.g. Malgosia Fitzmaurice and Dan Sarooshi, Issues of State Responsibility before
International Judicial Institutions: The Clifford Chance Lectures, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004, p. 167: “The
ILC Articles are virtually never explicitly mentioned in HRC discussions or for that matter in those of other
human rights treaty organs.” For ECtHR specifically, see e.g. James Crawford and Amelia Keene, “The

breach of an international obligation of the State.179 “[B]oth elements are equally necessary
for the attachment of concrete consequences of responsibility.” 180

4.1.1. Attribution

As referred to above, for conduct to be characterised as an “internationally wrongful act”, it
must first be attributable to the State in question. 181

While States are legal persons with

authority to act under international law, 182 the elementary fact is that States have no physical
existence, and thus can only act through person(s) whose conduct is performed on the States
behalf: 183 “States can act only by and through their agents and representatives.” 184
Actions/omissions of persons acting on behalf of the State are attributable to the State, and
thus considered to be actions of the State itself.

In the ILC Articles, Chapter II of Part 1 deals with the question of attribution. Article 4
provides that conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of the State (whether
exercising legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions), and an organ includes any
person/entity that has status in accordance with the State’s internal law. 185

International

lawyers and academics disagree on precisely who is a State agent for attribution purposes, but
they do agree that a State must have substantial control over an individual in order for the
person to be considered the State’s agent. 186

Decisions to provide MLA are clearly attributable to the State, as the persons making
decisions to provide MLA are linked to the State’s executive government, as public State
entities. For example, in the aforementioned case, Maha Elgizouli, the UK Home Secretary

(a Cabinet Minister for the UK government), authorised provision of MLA to the US. While
the specific governmental entity in charge of making MLA decisions may vary between
States, the decisions always come from governmental offices and agents. Thus, it can be
clearly established that any decision making act connected provision of MLA is attributable
to the State under international law, thus satisfying Article 2(a) of the ILC Articles.

4.1.2. Breach of an International Obligation

As noted above, the second requirement for the existence of an internationally wrongful act is
that the conduct attributable to the State constitutes a breach of an international obligation of
the State.187

What is required is discrepancy between a normative obligation on the one

hand, and the actual conduct on the other: “[t]here is a breach of an international obligation
by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that
obligation, regardless of its origin or character.”188 “[R]egardless of its origin or character”
refers to the applicability of all international legal obligations of States: “[i]nternational
obligations may be established by a customary rule of international law, by a treaty or by a
general principle applicable within the international legal order.” 189

A relevant primary

obligation incumbent on the State must therefore be established, and then it must be shown
that the State’s actual conduct did not conform to what was legally required of it.

Regarding the provision of MLA, the question then turns to the topic of Chapter 2, i.e.
whether there exists a legal obligation on abolitionist States to obtain death penalty
assurances before the State provides MLA for use in a foreign criminal proceeding that may
result in death penalty, and/or an obligation to withhold MLA in the absence of such
assurances.

As conduct proscribed by an international obligation may involve acts and

omissions, 190 or a combination of acts and omissions, the specific formulation as a positive
obligation to obtain assurances, or a negative obligation to refrain from providing MLA in the
absence of assurances, is immaterial.

Aliina Vegar

As established in the preceding chapters, the legal obligation discussed would require
abolitionist States to do more than merely refrain from imposing the death penalty. Rather,
there would also exist a legal obligation not to facilitate the use of the death penalty in
foreign States through the provision of MLA in such circumstances. Chapter 2 of this study
concluded that such an obligation can, perhaps, be read into existing treaty law: thus
prohibiting abolitionist States from providing MLA to death penalty retentionist States for
use in criminal proceedings that may result in the death penalty, without having first obtained
death penalty assurances.

Therefore, there is a possibility that such an international

obligation can be established.

On this view, if an abolitionist State were to provide MLA to a retentionist State for use in a
criminal proceeding which may result in the death penalty, without having obtained death
penalty assurances, the State’s conduct would not be in conformity with what is required of it
by the aforementioned international obligation. Thus, the second condition required to
establish an internationally wrongful act as provided by Article 2(b) of the ILC Articles
would also be satisfied, as the abolitionist State would be in breach of an international
obligation.

4.2.

Potential Problems

However, as outlined in the preceding chapter, jurisdictional limits to human rights
obligations may present an obstacle to finding an obligation in the context of this study. “A
state […] owes no obligations to persons beyond its ‘jurisdiction’, and cannot incur direct
responsibility should that person suffer from a rights violation.” 191

If it was found that a

jurisdictional link did not exist, then the provision of MLA without death penalty assurances
may not breach any international obligation per se, in which case there would be no
“internationally wrongful act” as defined in the ILC Articles (and thus not igniting the
international responsibility of the abolitionist State).

Oxford University Press, pp. 521-556, 2009, p. 539.

Aliina Vegar

In the same line, it may be forwarded that the obligation to obtain death penalty assurances
before providing MLA in the circumstances of this study is thus a political obligation, rather
than a legal one. This may introduce problems with finding responsibility of the abolitionist
State, as “responsibility only attaches to the breach of legal obligations.”192 When a State
assumes a political obligation, they may incur political reprobation in the event of a breach,
but they will not incur legal State responsibility in the sense presented in this chapter.

5. State Responsibility for Complicity in an Internationally Wrongful Act
If jurisdictional limits ultimately impede the establishment of an international obligation in
the context of this study, it would mean that that failure to obtain death penalty assurances
would not attract the primary responsibility of the abolitionist State. However, the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility provide another potential avenue, whereby the derivative
responsibility of the abolitionist State may be established on the same facts.

Article 16 of the ILC Articles deals with the situation where one State assists in the
commission of internationally wrongful act of another State. Article 16 provides that: where
a State aids/assists another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act by the
latter State, the aiding State is internationally responsible for doing so if 1) the State does so
with the knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and 2) the act
would be internationally wrongful if committed by the aiding State.193

5.1.

Complicity

The concept of “complicity” is contentious, both in terms of formulation of legal doctrine,
and in individual cases (domestically and internationally). 194 In the drafting of Article 16,
the ILC discarded the term “complicity” for the more neutral sounding concept of “aid or
assistance” of the ILC Articles. 195 However, courts and academic theorists alike frequently
use the terms interchangeably. This study adopts the term “complicity” for the situations
covered by Article 16 of the ILC Articles, principally for the convenience of not needing to
refer each time to the phrase “aid or assistance in the commission of an internationally
wrongful act”.

Furthermore, although the term “complicity” originally stems from criminal law, the meaning
and the elements of the concept differ in the State responsibility arena.

Standards for

accomplice responsibility vary in the various frameworks in which complicity (or aiding and

abetting) is considered, for example in domestic tort law, international and domestic criminal
law and in the law of non-contractual obligations. 196

Thus, this study reminds that

interdisciplinary comparisons have limited usefulness, as complicity in each of these
frameworks has independent meaning.

This study thus seeks to establish the meaning of

complicity (i.e. “aid or assistance in an internationally wrongful act”) in the normative
framework of Article 16 of the ILC Articles and in the human rights framework of the
ICCPR and the ECHR, to ascertain if abolitionist States can be considered “complicit” in the
death penalty through provision of MLA without requisite assurances.

5.2.

The Limited Scope of Article 16

By the text of the provision, it is alluring to use Article 16 of the ILC Articles to argue that an
abolitionist State attracts derivative State responsibility if, through providing MLA, it were to
assist judicial execution in a foreign State. In principle, the assistance provided may be
vitally important in the criminal proceeding (as in Maha Elgizouli), and thus make imposing
the death penalty possible. Therefore, a clear causal/enabling connection can often be made
between the MLA provided without having obtained death penalty assurances, and the
imposition of a death penalty sentence.197 However, the ILC Commentary to the Articles on
State Responsibility limits the scope of Article 16 in a number of ways. Depending on the
specific circumstances, some of these limitations can be rather easily resolved, while others
may be fatal to the claim.

5.2.1. Easily Resolved Limitations

The ILC Commentary provides that the relevant State organ providing assistance (here, the
State organ providing MLA) must be aware of the circumstances making the conduct
internationally wrongful. 198 This may be relatively easily resolved of present purposes, as
abolitionist States are aware that it is internationally wrongful if they were themselves to

subject individuals to the death penalty. Furthermore, inline with paragraph 4 of the ILC
Commentary on Article 16, the abolitionist State is very likely to be “[…]aware of the
circumstances in which its aid or assistance is intended to be used by the other State”,199 (i.e.
that the MLA will be used in a criminal proceeding that may result in the death penalty).
Therefore, it is likely that this first limitation can be easily resolved in the case at hand.

This leads to the other easily resolvable limitation provided in the ILC Commentary: that the
completed act must be such that it would have been wrongful had it been committed by the
assisting State itself. 200 This is also easy to satisfy for present purposes: States that have
ratified a treaty prohibiting imposition of the death penalty would fulfil this element if they
were to impose the death penalty. 201 Thus, this would encompass abolitionist States party to
the ECHR and/or the ICCPR.

5.2.2. The Subjective Element – Intent or Knowledge?
The Commentary to the ILC Articles also provides that the aid/assistance must be given
“with a view of facilitating the commission of that act.” 202

The ILC elaborates on this,

stating that the aiding State will not be responsible under Article 16 unless 1) the State organ
concerned intended, by the assistance given, to facilitate the occurrence of the wrongful
conduct; and 2) that the wrongful conduct actually occurred.203

This presents two problems.

First, “[i]t is hardly ever the case […] that abolitionist States

directly intend to bring about the death penalty through their conduct.” 204 Second, the act
(the death penalty, or a death penalty sentence) would actually have to occur. Thus, if
responsibility ensued, it would do so only upon the death penalty sentence being imposed
(not upon the act of providing MLA without having obtained death penalty assurances), as
“there is no such concept as an attempted internationally wrongful act.”205

Regarding the first problem, the ILC Commentary thus suggests that the abolitionist State,
through providing MLA, intended to facilitate or contribute to the imposition of the death
penalty. On this reading, knowledge of the activities of the other State is insufficient, it must
be established that the MLA is supplied for the purpose of assisting the foreign State in the
commission of the death penalty. 206 However, in almost all cases this would very difficult to
prove. In the context of this study, States may always argue that they are not specifically
intending to facilitate the death penalty by providing MLA, they are intending to assist in the
criminal proceeding (regardless of sentencing outcome). Thus, on a strict reading, complicity
per Article 16 could fail at this level.

However, there is disagreement about the precise scope of the subjective element of
complicity in Article 16. As Article 16 may not in and of itself be determinative of the issue
of complicity, 207 arguments have been forwarded to question if “intent” is actually
required. 208

One such argument is that “intent” has not been explicitly adopted into the

language of Article 16, it is only mentioned in the ILC commentary, despite the original draft
Article on complicity (then, Article 27) explicitly containing the word “intention”. 209
Further, upon amendment, ILC members themselves were uncertain whether the new Article
16 required intent, or just knowledge that the assisted State will or may use the assistance to
commit an internationally wrongful act.

This can be seen in the following statement from

the Report from the ILC’s Fifty-First Session:

“Questions were also raised with respect to the meaning of the phrase “with
knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act”. Did it mean that
the assisting State must have the intention of facilitating the commission of the
internationally wrongful act, or was it sufficient that it had knowledge of the fact that
the assisted State would use the aid or assistance to commit an internationally
wrongful act? What should be done about cases of uncertainty, e.g., where there was a
risk that the assisted State would so act, but it was not certain?” 210

Furthermore, it has been argued that the object and purpose of Article 16 would be defeated
by an intent requirement. 211

It goes without saying that it is problematic to establish

psychological elements of States, insofar as a State does not have its own “will” in the sense
that individuals do.212 Further, the need to prove that the State supplying assistance wanted
to support the wrongful act is a very stringent test. Thus, “it seems highly questionable that
such a narrow interpretation of intent as a decisive criterion for complicity is really useful”,213
as it may render the whole notion of complicity at international law unworkable. If intent is
required, “liability will only be found in the most limited of instances where a country makes
clear its intentions to facilitate human rights abuses. Countries will rarely declare these
intentions, and meeting the intent requirement without these declarations will prove near
impossible.”214 The intent requirement has thus been heavily criticised by commentators, as
it makes it easy for assisting States to evade accountability: “the inclusion of the intent
requirement […] would prevent punishing countries that enabled human rights abuses simply
because they did not intend such a result, although they were fully aware of it.” 215

Due to the above, it is argued here that the intent requirement is not required to ascertain
complicity in this context. While intent may not be required, “there is near unanimity in the
literature that responsibility under Article 16 [of the ILC Articles] requires some subjective
relationship between the assisting State and the commission of the wrongful act by the main
actor.”216 Discussions on complicity in torture by the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights
(“JCHR”) provide relevant comments here, suggesting that the assisting State’s knowledge of
the real and imminent risk that the aid provided might assist the commission of an
internationally wrongful act is sufficient to satisfy the subjective element of complicity. For
example, in the JCHR’s report regarding allegations of UK complicity in torture, the JCHR
noted that complicity in torture “means simply one State giving assistance to another State in
the commission of torture, or acquiescing in such torture, in the knowledge, including
constructive knowledge, of the circumstances of the torture which is or has been taking
place”.217

Thus, the JCHR does not refer to “intention” as a requirement for complicity,

rather it considers knowledge of the real and imminent risk of torture, including constructive
knowledge, to suffice. 218

The extradition cases discussed in Chapter 2 also suggest that

proof of intent in not required, whereby “the responsibility of the sending state is not based
on intent but solely on actual or even constructive knowledge”219 of the risk in the foreign
State for the individual in question.220

Due to the above arguments, this study submits that abolitionist States can incur
responsibility for aiding imposition of the death penalty by foreign States, even when they do
not directly intend their assistance to do so. It is enough that such States knew (or ought to
have known) that the provision of MLA might facilitate the use of the death penalty. 221 In
the case of provision of MLA without obtaining death penalty assurances, it is clear that upon
MLA request, States are made aware of the circumstances of the criminal trial, aware of
which crimes are punishable by death in the MLA-receiving State, and thus aware that
provision of MLA in the prosecution may, by consequence, assist the use of capital
punishment in the foreign State.

The State’s knowledge that its conduct may assist use of

the death penalty can generally be inferred from the circumstances and from its actions (for
example, from information provided by the MLA-seeking State in the MLA request, from
observation that an individual is indicted on capital charges, from documentation of the
abolitionist State contemplating whether or not to seek death penalty assurances, or death
penalty assurance requests that have been refused by the MLA-receiving State).

For

example, in Maha Elgizouli, UK’s knowledge that it may facilitate use of the death penalty
through its provision of MLA can be construed from the fact that it sought death penalty
assurances in the first instance (as it was aware of the risk of death penalty), and then, upon
US refusal to provide such assurances, the UK provided the requested MLA, despite the risk
of judicial execution. This study submits that in such circumstances, regardless of whether or
not the UK intended to facilitate the death penalty, the UK’s unquestionable knowledge that
the provision of MLA under these circumstances could facilitate the death penalty equates to
a sufficient subjective element to satisfy Article 16.

5.2.3. Internationally Wrongful Act of the Committing State
Another problematic criterion of Article 16 is that responsibility only arises where a State
voluntarily assists another State “in carrying out conduct which violates the international
obligations of the latter.”222

Thus, the State committing the allegedly wrongful act must be

legally prohibited from doing so.223

This is problematic, as the State in which the criminal

proceeding (and thus death penalty) is occurring is a death penalty retentionist State, and thus
very unlikely to have legally bound itself to prohibit the death penalty in its jurisdiction.

It

is only those States who are parties to treaties that prohibit judicial execution that would be
committing an internationally wrongful act by imposing such a sanction, not a State who has
taken on no such obligation at international law.

This presents a problem for cases such as the aforementioned Maha Elgizouli, as the US, for
example, is not party to a treaty prohibiting the death penalty, and nor is there a general rule
of international law prohibiting the death penalty. 224 Thus, lending to the wording in Article
16, responsibility of the abolitionist State for complicity in an internationally wrongful act is
not possible, as the retentionist State itself is not committing an internationally wrongful act
by submitting an offender to the death penalty.

222

ILC Commentary to Article 16, para. 1. See also, Supra., (note 25), James Crawford, p. 148. This can be
seen directly in the wording of Article 16 itself: the State assists “in the commission of an internationally
wrongful act by the latter […]” (italics added).
223
Supra., (note 1), Bharat Malkani, p. 527.
224
Note, however, there is a continued trend in international law and in State practice towards prohibition of the
death penalty. Very few States are expanding or introducing the use of the death penalty, and thus some argue
there is a global trend toward abolition, and also a general rule of international law prohibiting the death penalty
developing. See e.g. Supra., (note 1), Bharat Malkani, p. 527; William Schabas, The Abolition of the Death
Penalty in International Law, vol. 3, Cambridge University Press, 2003; Roger Hood, The Death Penalty: A
Worldwide Perspective, vol. 4, Oxford, 2008. See also supra., (note 9), Maha Elgizouli (SC decision , Lord
Kerr at para. 148: “In his intervention in this case Professor Heyns suggested that “there is an emerging norm of
customary international law that the death penalty as such is a violation of the absolute right against torture and
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of punishment, and that a norm against the facilitation of the death
penalty follows from that.””; See also, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, Interim Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment: Note by the Secretary General, A/67/279, 9 August 2012: “there is an
evolving standard whereby states and judiciaries consider the death penalty to be a violation per se of the
prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment … The Special Rapporteur is convinced that a
customary norm prohibiting the death penalty under all circumstances, if it has not already emerged, is at least
in the process of formation.”; Furthermore, as noted in supra., (note 1), Bharat Malkani, p.527, there are some
general rules of international law governing use of the death penalty – for example prohibition of the death
penalty for minors (under 18 years old). Thus, if a retentionist State were to impose the death penalty on such
an individual, an MLA providing State would incur responsibility per Article 16.

5.3.

Lex Specialis

However, as referred to earlier, Article 16 may not be determinative of the issue. Article 16
may be “remedied by resort to primary rules that take precedence as lex specialis”, 225 as
provided by Article 55 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 55 provides that
the ILC Articles “do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of
an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international
responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.” 226

As it remains to be determined if Article 16 is a proper articulation of the concept of
complicity, the Article can be superseded by the lex specialis on complicity in this context, if
such primary rules are found to exist.227 Assessment and interpretation is therefore required
to determine what complicity means in the framework of primary (i.e. special) rules of
international law, to enable proper interpretation of Article 16 in the context of State
complicity in the use of the death penalty.

Chapter 2 of this study also significantly discusses abolitionist State facilitation of the death
penalty from a human rights perspective. This study intends for the reader contemplate the
subject matter of these two parts in unison, in the formation of the lex specialis on complicity
in death penalty.

5.4.

The Primary Rules of Complicity in the Death Penalty

The main duty for abolitionist States is simply to refrain from imposing the death penalty
within their jurisdiction.

However, as discussed throughout this study, it is possible that

there also a secondary obligation, to refrain from aiding or assisting in the death penalty
elsewhere.

The foundation of the concept of “complicity” is a finding of responsibility of

one State on the basis of another State’s actions, which is justified by the secondary State’s
contribution to the act committed.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (“UNODC”) has recognised that through its work, there
is potential for it to be complicit in the death penalty. In a 2012 position paper, UNODC
provided that “If […] a country actively continues to apply the death penalty for drug
offences, UNODC places itself in a very vulnerable position vis-à-vis its responsibility to
respect human rights if it maintains support to law enforcement units, prosecutors or courts
within the criminal justice system.” 228 While UNODC is not a State, it is largely funded by
States, including abolitionist States. The quote exemplifies the framework in which a State
that provides MLA in the context of this study may incur derivative responsibility for its
assistance in the death penalty.

However, as mentioned earlier, in terms of complicity in

death penalty, the fact that the conduct in question is not prohibited for the primary State is
problematic for the finding of secondary responsibility.

5.4.1. The Obligation to Protect

The concept of prohibiting complicity in death penalty may be supported by the “obligation
to protect” in human rights law, that being a positive obligation requiring States to take steps
to prevent abuses of human rights occurring, either domestically or in foreign States. 229 For
example, the right to life also contains the obligation to protect life, not only the obligation to
abstain from unlawful killings.

In the ECHR context, this can be seen in Osman v UK,

where the ECtHR considered that authorities may breach Article 2 if it were established that
they knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk to the life of the
individual concerned from the acts of a third party, and the State failed to take reasonable
measures to avoid that risk. 230

In the ICCPR context, Article 6 has also been read to require

States to protect the right to life by preventing third party killing. 231 The connection between
the obligation to protect and the law on complicity can be seen from, for example, the fact

that the duty-holding State does not need to participate directly in the human rights abuse in
order to have international responsibility. 232

The obligation to protect in human rights law is applied in various contexts, justifying
findings of State responsibility in situations where the actual violation is not attributable to
the State in question. Non-refoulement is a very relevant context for the question of this
study, whereby States “must take action – that is, not return someone to his [or her] home
country – in order to protect that person from abuse by that country”, 233 (and other analogues
like prohibition of extradition, as frequently discussed throughout this thesis). The main idea
here is that States should not place people in situations where there is risk of rights abuse:
“the duty to protect requires States to ensure that they do not enable or assist a third party to
engage in conduct that results in the violation of a right.”234

Depending on the context,

through transferring the individual in question, the sending State significantly enables a third
party to impose convention-contrary treatment (whether or not that treatment is prohibited for
the receiving State), and “that enabling relationship seems to trigger the obligation to
protect.”235 In the same way, it can be argued that an MLA-providing State who does not
seek death penalty assurances significantly enables a third party (the retentionist State) to
impose the death penalty, thus triggering the obligation to protect for the abolitionist State
(given that the death penalty is prohibited conduct for the abolitionist State in question). In
this sense, it can be argued that the obligation to protect is significantly linked to complicity
in Article 16.

There are, however, distinctions that can be drawn between complicity and the obligation to
protect. For example, as provided by Helmut Aust: “an infringement upon the prohibition of
refoulement triggers the responsibility of the extraditing State regardless of whether the
[human rights violation] eventually materialises. […] In situations covered by the concept of

established the non-refoulement principle in the ECHR (derived from Article 3). In this case, extradition was not
permitted on the grounds that the long wait on death row would amount to treatment contrary to ECHR Article
3.

complicity [under the Articles on State Responsibility], no responsibility would intervene if
the wrongful act of the main actor was never committed as there is no such concept as an
attempted internationally wrongful act.”236 However, many say this is an artificial distinction
(including Aust himself).237

Furthermore, the previous Draft Articles on State Responsibility contained, at Article 23, a
specific Article dedicated to responsibility of States to prevent wrongful acts (i.e. the
obligation to protect). The ILC’s distinction between the two areas (by originally codifying
them in 2 separate Articles) could be argued to be evidence of disparity between the two
concepts. Moreover, the absence of an article to this effect in the current Articles on State
Responsibility can be argued to be a rejection of the concept of State responsibility to prevent
wrongful acts altogether.238

However, it can also be forwarded that “the reason for the disappearance of the old Article 23
[…], as well as the disappearance of many rules already contained in the previous Draft, is
that the present members of the Commission are of the opinion that such rules do not pertain
to State responsibility (they were not secondary rules) but rather belong to the realm of
primary rules.” 239 On this reasoning, the obligation to protect is a primary rule, thus
superseding Article 16 (as provided by Article 55 of the ILC Articles).

It has also been

argued that the ILC was wrong to draw a sharp distinction between the two concepts of
complicity and obligation to protect, and rather, that the concepts “work in tandem when
assessing the scope of obligations”.240

The obligation to protect has been used to justify findings of State responsibility where one
State enables a third party’s wrongdoing, and yet that enabling action falls short of conduct
necessary for attribution. In extraterritorial cases, there is conceptual confusion in this area.
For example, the reasoning of the ECtHR regularly confuses why, for instance, a State having
“decisive influence” in another State justifies a finding of State responsibility
extraterritorially: does responsibility find its basis in attribution (whereby attribution ascribes

abuse to the assisting state, in which case a violation of the obligation to “respect” is found),
or does the influence engage the State’s obligation to protect (i.e. finding that the State
violated its obligation to “protect” individuals from abuse by a third party, whereby the State
is responsible as a bystander)?

Monica Hakimi discusses this, and how the concept of

complicity and the obligation to protect are connected. For example, in Cyprus v Turkey,241
where the ECtHR found Turkey responsible as a result of abuses that the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus (“TRNC”) committed, 242 the ECtHR acknowledged that the abuses where
not demonstrably attributable to Turkey per the rules of attribution. 243 However, the ECtHR
still found Turkey responsible, and the ECtHR “vacillated incoherently between suggesting:
(1) that attribution was nevertheless appropriate; and (2) that Turkey had failed to satisfy an
obligation to protect.”244

In her assessment of the ECtHR’s decisions in Cyprus v Turkey,

and Ilaşcu v. Moldova and Russia,245 regarding extraterritorial reach of the ECHR, Monica
Hakimi provides that:

“In each case, the defendant state propped up and provided immense support to an
abusive external actor. Turkey supported the Turkish Cypriot administration in
northern Cyprus, and Russia did the same for the separatists in Moldova. But the
claimants could not demonstrate that, since ratifying the European Convention on
Human Rights, those states participated in the abuses at issue. The European Court of
Human Rights nevertheless held them responsible. The court is unclear on why the
defendant states are responsible. In the absence of evidence that the states participated
in the particular abuses at issue, the correct answer lies in the obligation to protect.
Turkey and Russia installed and provided considerable support to external actors that
violated rights. Having extensively enabled those actors, the states could not lawfully
stand by.”246

241

Supra., (note 148), Cyprus v Turkey.
Ibid., paras. 69-80.
243
Ibid., para. 76, the ECtHR states that: “It is not necessary to determine whether […] Turkey actually
exercised detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the TRNC”.
Note, there is much
conceptual confusion in the ECtHR regarding the obligation to protect and attribution for the actual abuse. See
supra., (note 186), Monica Hakimi, pp. 353-354, and p. 377: “The court determined that Turkey’s human rights
obligations applied in northern Cyprus because Turkey exercised territorial control there. If those obligations
applied because of Turkey’s territorial control, then they presumably applied to all abuses in the relevant
territory. Yet the court determined that Turkish responsibility flowed only from the abuses committed by the
Turkish Cypriot administration (TRNC), and not from private abuses in the area. The court had difficulty
explaining that distinction. Ultimately, it fudged its attribution analysis, justifying its finding by reference to
Turkey’s close relationship with the TRNC. If that relationship justifies the obligation, then it is unclear why
territorial control matters.”

Decisions such as the above show that the obligation to protect is connected to complicity.
Where a State enables a third actor’s human rights violations, the State’s obligation to protect
may be engaged, whereby it cannot justifiably standby and do nothing. “[C]onduct akin to
complicity (but short of the participation necessary for attribution) is […] relevant to
appraising state bystander responsibility.” 247

Similarly it can be argued here that where a

State is asked to provide MLA for a criminal proceeding that may result in death penalty, the
State is, if it provides the MLA, enabling imposition of the death penalty in the third State.
This reality ignites the abolitionist State’s obligation to protect (which it can fulfil through
obtaining death penalty assurances, or withholding MLA in the absence of such assurances).
If it fails to do this, the State violates its’ positive obligation to protect, flowing from the right
to life and right to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (as
codified in ECHR and the ICCPR, and enhanced by their respective protocols abolishing the
death penalty).

Therefore it is argued here that the obligation to protect may help remedy the limits of the
law of complicity (and thus of Article 16 of the ILC Articles), whereby not all stringent
requirements of Article 16 require total satisfaction. While discussing the topic of nonrefoulement, Monica Hakimi provided that:
“[a] state that transfers someone to another state, despite the risk of abuse, usually
does not transfer the person ‘with a view to facilitating’ that abuse. Absent some
indication to the contrary, the state’s involvement does not rise to the level necessary
for assisting responsibility [per Article 16]. Rather, the state is responsible because it
fails to satisfy an obligation to protect.”248
This shows that State responsibility for complicity is enhanced by the obligation to protect.
The quote also exemplifies how State responsibility can be found even in the absence of full
satisfaction of Article 16, (in the quote above, without proving that the transfer occurred
“with a view to facilitating” the abuse, which textually a requirement of Article 16).249

The obligation to protect, formulated as a primary obligation, supersedes Article 66 (in
accordance to Article 55 of the Articles on State Responsibility). “Put another way, even if
an assisting State's conduct does not meet the stringent requirements for complicity under

As discussed in subheading 5.2.2. of this study, “The Subjective Element – Intent or Knowledge?”
248

54

Aliina Vegar

Article 16 as discussed above, that State may nonetheless be responsible because it failed to
satisfy an affirmative obligation to protect.”250

Thus, as the general rule of Article 16 on

complicity does not trump what is required by the primary (i.e. special) rules, 251 the
obligation to protect (if considered a primary rule of law) supersedes the limits of Article 16.
This is the normative environment in which Article 16 must be analysed. 252

5.4.2. Complicity at International Law and Complicity in Torture

The law of complicity in death penalty can also be developed and complemented by
analysing the law of state responsibility for complicity in other areas of human rights law,
specifically of that in torture. The law of complicity in torture can specifically highlight what
sort of conduct constitutes complicity in this area.253 The Convention Against Torture and
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (“CAT”) explicitly prohibits complicity in
torture, whereby Article 4(1) provides that State parties “shall ensure that all acts of torture
are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and
to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture.”254

Unlike CAT, the ECHR and the ICCPR do not explicitly prohibit complicity in torture.
However, prohibition of complicity in torture is implicit in the general prohibition of torture
of these conventions, codified in Artilce 7 of the ICCPR, and Article 3 of the ECHR. 255 As
discussed in this study, a form of complicity in torture has long been prohibited, that being
prohibition of extradition/expulsion of an individual to a State where he or she is likely to
suffer from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Other findings of complicity in torture have been made in the ECHR context, which relate to
extraordinary renditions. Extraordinary rendition is “a process by which a detainee is
transferred to another State’s custody outside regular legal proceedings and with the prospect

of being subjected to torture or at least cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.” 256 The issue
of complicity has been highlighted in such cases as secondary States can, to varying degrees,
be held to have facilitated the maltreatment of individuals by the primary State. This has been
shown specifically in the ECHR context, where European State support in unlawful rendition
cases included things like “the granting of over flight rights, the provision of secret detention
facilities […], and cooperation in the exchange of intelligence material.” 257 For example, in
the case Al Nashiri v Poland,258 Poland was found responsible under the ECHR for its part in
CIA rendition activities. The ECtHR concluded that Poland’s enabling action 259 made it
complicit in the ill-treatment of the Applicant, and thus Poland was found to have violated,
among other Articles, Articles 2 and 3 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol 6 (due to the
substantial and foreseeable risk that the individual in question would be subjected to death
penalty).260

In the context of extraordinary renditions, the Secretary General of the CoE discussed the
issue of complicity, stating that:

“In accordance with the generally recognised rules on State responsibility, States may
be held responsible for aiding or assisting another State in the commission of an
internationally wrongful act. There can be little doubt that aid or assistance by agents
of a State party in the commission of human rights abuses by agents of another State
acting within the former’s jurisdiction would constitute a violation of the Convention.
Even acquiescence and connivance of the authorities in the acts of foreign agents
affecting Convention rights might engage the State party’s responsibility under the
Convention.”261
The meaning of complicity in torture at international law varies somewhat depending on the
specific source and context analysed. As discussed, international criminal law’s definition of
the concept varies from that of State responsibility. According to the International Criminal

Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (“ICTY”), thus in the context of individual criminal
responsibility, findings of complicity in torture require satisfaction of 3 elements: 1)
knowledge that torture is taking place; 2) a contribution by way of assistance; and 3) that the
contribution has substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime itself. 262 However, CAT’s
monitoring body, the UN Committee Against Torture (“CAT Committee”), takes a wider
view of complicity, whereby “acquiescence” and “tacit consent” is enough, as is constructive
as well as actual knowledge that torture is taking place. 263 The CAT Committee is also does
not appear to require that the assistance have substantial effect on the perpetration of the
eventual torture.264

The JCHR discussed these two meanings, and distinguished them on the basis that the ICTY
is dealing with individual criminal responsibility, while the CAT definition is focussed on
State responsibility. 265

Thus, as mentioned earlier, the JCHR took the view that State

complicity in torture “means simply one State giving assistance to another State in the
commission of torture, or acquiescing in such torture, in the knowledge, including
constructive knowledge, of the circumstances of the torture which is or has been taking
place”.266

This is supported by the CoE Secretary General’s comment above, that, in the

context of rendition activities, “[e]ven acquiescence and connivance of the authorities in the
acts of foreign agents affecting Convention rights might engage the State party’s
responsibility under the Convention.” 267

Further, in defining what amounts to State responsibility per Article 16 in terms of assistance
in torture, the JCHR read the Articles on State Responsibility in conjunction with other rules
and definitions in international law on complicity (like those stemming from CAT and the
ICTY Statute).268 This suggests, as argued in this study, that Article 16 is not determinative

262

Article 7(1) of the ICTY Statute provides for individual criminal responsibility: “A person who planned,
instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a
crime referred to in articles 2 to 5 of the present Statute, shall be individually responsible for the crime." The 3
elements of complicity in ICTY derived from Prosecutor v Anto Furundžija, International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia, Judgment of 10 December 1998, Case No. IT-95-17/1-T. See also

of the question of State complicity, thus supporting the argument that the limits of Article 16
can be overcome for the question at hand.

5.5.

Overcoming Limitations
5.5.1. Internationally Wrongful Act of the Committing State: Part 2

The lex specialis of complicity in death penalty, as analysed in this chapter, exemplifies how
Article 16 of the ILC Articles is not, in and of itself, determinative of the question of State
complicity in capital punishment. With this in mind, we can return to one of the problematic
criterions outlined at the beginning of this chapter, that Article 16 explicitly dictates that State
responsibility only arises where a State voluntarily assists another State “in carrying out
conduct which violates the international obligations of the latter”, 269 (i.e. that the State
committing the allegedly wrongful act must be legally prohibited from doing so). 270 As
already discussed, this is problematic in the context of this study, as the State in which the
criminal proceeding (and thus death penalty) is occurring is, most likely, a death penalty
retentionist State, and therefore the State is not legally prohibited from imposing capital
punishment. Thus, by the text of the provision, there is no internationally wrongful act for
the abolitionist State to be complicit in.

However, this study again highlights that Article 16 may be “remedied by resort to primary
rules that take precedence as lex specialis”. 271

Relevant lex specialis can be located in

extradition and non-refoulement cases, and unlawful rendition cases, as already discussed
throughout this study. This study uses three examples from the ECHR framework, AlSaadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, F.G. v Sweden, and Al Nashiri v Poland, to argue that
complicity in death penalty can be found, despite capital punishment being legal in the
principal State imposing it.

In Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, the ECtHR concluded that the UK violated the ECHR
by transferring the applicants to Iraq, as there were substantial grounds for believing that
there was a real risk of the applicants being subjected to the death penalty. 272

In F.G. v

Sweden, the ECtHR concluded that, considering the alleged risk of the applicant facing
capital punishment in Iran, Sweden would be in violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR if
it removed the applicant to Iran without the Swedish authorities making and ex nuc
assessment of the consequences of this conversion. 273

In Al Nashiri v Poland, Poland

assisted in the unlawful rendition activities of the US, including assisting the US to secretly
fly Al Nashiri out of Poland, despite the real and foreseeable risk that the applicant would be
subjected to further torture and the death penalty in the US. The ECtHR found that the
Poland’s assistance in the transfer of Al Nashiri from Poland to the US, when where there
was foreseeable risk of exposure to capital punishment, violated both Article 2 and 3 of the
ECHR, stating that: “Article 2 of the Convention prohibits the extradition or deportation of an
individual to another State where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he
or she would face a real risk of being subjected to the death penalty there.” 274

These cases are highlighted as they all have something in common: the death penalty is
legally permissible for the State imposing the sanction (Iran, Iraq and the US). Thus, the
State imposing (or potentially imposing) capital punishment in each case is not committing
an internationally wrongful act by doing so. Despite this, the ECHR-contracting States in
these cases (the UK, Sweden and Poland) were all found responsible under the ECHR for
their involvement in the acts in question.

This is very relevant for ascertaining the lex specialis of complicity in death penalty, and the
way in which Article 16 of the ILC Articles should be viewed. In these cases, the issue was
not whether the receiving State would be in violation of international law if it executed the
individuals in question. 275 The legal justification for prohibiting abolitionist States from
272

Supra., (note 37), Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v the UK, paras. 144-145. Violation of Article 3 was found. In
view of finding vilation of Article 3, the ECtHR stated: “the Court does not consider it necessary to decide
whether there have also been violations of the applicants’ rights under Article 2 of the Convention and Article 1
of Protocol No. 13.”
273
Supra., (note 59), F.G. v Sweden, para. 110: “At the outset the Court observes that in the context of
expulsion, where there are substantial grounds to believe that the person in question, if expelled, would face a
real risk of capital punishment, torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the destination
country, both Articles 2 and 3 imply that the Contracting State must not expel that person.”

extraditing/expelling individuals to face the death penalty in retentionist States depends on
the treaty obligations of the sending State. The same can be said for the assistance in the
transfer of Al Nashiri in the unlawful rendition case of Al Nashiri v Poland. Poland’s
assistance in the transfer of the applicant to the US violated its obligations per ECHR Articles
2 and 3, due to Poland’s abolitionist legal obligations per the ECHR, and irrespective of the
legality of the death penalty in the US.

Such cases have exemplified how the threshold of Article 16 of the ILC Articles may have
been modified in this respect: the abolitionist State can incur responsibility, based on the real
risk of the death penalty, irrespective of the primary State’s own responsibility. 276 Thus, this
study submits that this textual limitation of Article 16 of the ILC Articles can be overcome in
the case at hand. What is materially important is the obligations of abolitionist States with
respect to the death penalty, and not whether the capital punishment-imposing State is itself
in violation of an international obligation.

5.5.2. Wrongful Conduct Must Have Occurred

On the same line, as discussed earlier in this chapter, another limitation presented in the ILC
Commentary to Article 16 is that the eventual wrongful conduct needs to have actually
occurred.277

Thus, as discussed, the act (the death penalty, or a death penalty sentence)

would actually have to occur in order to establish responsibility of the abolitionist State for its
provision of MLA per Article 16 of the ILC Articles (irrespective of the foreseeable risk of
the imposition of capital punishment by the MLA-receiving State). Therefore, if
responsibility ensued, it would do so only upon the death penalty sentence being imposed
(not upon the act of providing MLA without having obtained requisite assurances) as, in the
framework of the ILC Articles, “there is no such concept as an attempted internationally
wrongful act.”278

However, extradition cases have also exemplified how responsibility of the sending-State can
be established for its complicity in wrongful conduct, regardless of whether or not this
conduct eventually materialises. 279 Responsibility of the aiding State is often found before
the extradition takes place, or after it takes place but before prosecution in finalised. This is
due to the significant risk of capital punishment (or other proscribed ill-treatment). Thus, it is
likely that this limitation can also be overcome in the case at hand. This “risk-based”
responsibility is elaborated on in the following subchapter.

5.6.

Conceptual Issues in Comparing Non-Refoulement (and Other Analogues) to
Complicity

The conclusions in 5.5.1. and 5.5.2. above may be problematized by an important distinction
between non-refoulement/prohibition of extradition and the concept of complicity. It can be
argued that prohibition of extradition to face torture or the death penalty is not complicity in
an internationally wrongful act; the exposure of a person to such risk is an internationally
wrongful act in and of itself (if the question was to be reviewed per the ILC Articles and not
under the framework of the conventions in question).280

Thus, it can be argued that there is

an international obligation incumbent on abolitionist States not to extradite under such
circumstances; and thus, if a State were to extradite, it could be argued that this entails the
primary international responsibility of that State per Article 1 and 2 of the ILC Articles, as
opposed to derivative responsibility via Article 16. Thus, “[t]he responsibility of the State
which has extradited or repelled the person is not triggered for the reason of its support to the
eventual maltreatment, but for the fact that it exposed the individual to that danger.”281 As
discussed throughout this chapter, within the concept of complicity under Article 16 of the
ILC Articles, the wrongfulness of the aid or assistance is dependent on the wrongfulness of
the main State’s conduct, whereas primary responsibility is not concerned with another States
wrongdoing.
279

Ibid., p. 397.
Note, again, that although the ILC Articles are relevant considerations for establishing the responsibility of
States in the ECHR and HRC context, the ECtHR and HRC generally fail to mention the ILC Articles at all in
their jurisprudence. Thus, whether these extradition/expulsion/non-refoulement cases constitute primary
responsibility or derivative responsibility is not discussed or ascertained in either context: “The ILC Articles are
virtually never explicitly mentioned in HRC discussions or for that matter in those of other human rights treaty
organs.” (Supra.,(note 175), Malgosia Fitzmaurice and Dan Sarooshi, p. 167).

In one sense this argument, alongside the discussed parallels between extradition to face the
death penalty and provision of MLA in support of a criminal proceeding which may result in
the death penalty, supports the argument of the preceding chapters, that provision of MLA
under the circumstances of this study may attract the primary responsibility of the abolitionist
State for independently wrongful conduct. However, as discussed, jurisdictional limits may
impede the finding of primary responsibility in this context. Thus, some may argue that this
distinction between complicity and extradition should be upheld, whereby the two should not
be compared to build a case for prohibition of complicity in the death penalty through
provision of MLA, as they are conceptually different structures from a legal point of view.

However, the interpretation that these are fundamentally different concepts relies on a very
narrow view of Article 16 of the ILC Articles, which, as pointed out by discussions on the lex
specialis on complicity, may not be legally accurate: “While Article 16 […] is the generally
recognized form in which States may incur responsibility for complicity in international law,
other forms of complicity exist and do not fall within the scope of this provision.” 282 When
examined closely, the structural differences between the complicity and non-refoulement are
not very strong.

For example, under both concepts, ultimately the wrongfulness is still

dependent on the conduct of a third State:

“If State A is about to extradite Person B to State C in which B is likely to suffer
torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, the conduct of State C is decisive for
both responsibility for complicity and refoulement. The difference lies in the fact that
in the complicity scenario it needs to be established that the wrongful treatment of B
has actually intervened whereas in the refoulement scenario it is sufficient that there
are serious grounds to believe that B will be subjected to these forms of treatment. It
is thus doubtful whether there exists a qualitative difference between these two
conditions which would exclude the interpretation of the principle of non-refoulement
as a form of lex specialis for complicity.”283
From a broader perspective, while some differences exist between non-refoulement and
complicity, the concepts are still significantly connected. Some, like Helmut Aust, suggest
that prohibition of extradition to face torture or death penalty establishes “risk-based
responsibility for complicity” 284 (whereby responsibility ensues due to the significant risk of
maltreatment, regardless of whether or not the eventual conduct occurs, and regardless of

whether or not the eventual conduct is legally prohibited or permissible for the primary
State). This may be justified by the fundamental nature of the right to life and the right to be
free from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (and, perhaps, the right
not to be subjected to the death penalty), 285 as these rights enshrine some of the most basic
values of societies.286 The lowering of the threshold is necessary in order to establish State
responsibility in extradition cases, so that torture, capital punishment or extrajudicial killing
can be prevented from occurring in the first place. Thus, the change from an assessment of
whether or not wrongful conduct has actually been committed, or whether or not the conduct
is internationally wrongful for the committing State, to the assessment of an intervening risk
“is warranted from the viewpoint of an optimum protection of susceptible victims”. 287 With
this understanding, the position of this study is that the concept of non-refoulement (and other
analogues) and the concept complicity codified in Article 16 actually complement each other,
working in tandem in the assessment of complicity in the death penalty in the case at hand.

5.7.

The Scope of “Aid or Assistance”

5.7.1.

Contribution

This study notes that the mens rea element of complicity (the knowledge/intent discussion
above) must also be accompanied by sufficient actus reus (whereby the aid or assistance
must sufficiently contribute to the wrongful act in question in order for responsibility to
ensue).

The ILC has not defined what conduct constitutes sufficient “aid or assistance” to

incur derivative responsibility per Article 16.

Thus, questions arise as to how much

contribution the secondary State needs to make in order to satisfy a finding of complicity.
Nikolai Ushakov has highlighted the problem of contribution.

He discussed that the

aid/assistance cannot be too direct in character, as then the contributing State would become a

285

Supra., (note 37), Alsaadoon v Mufdhi, para. 118: “The court considers that, in respect of those states which
are bound by it, the right under article 1 of Protocol No 13 not to be subjected to the death penalty, which
admits of no derogation and applies in all circumstances, ranks along with the rights in articles 2 and 3 as a
fundamental right”.
286

63

Aliina Vegar

co-author of the offence (and this goes beyond complicity). However, the participation also
cannot be too indirect, as then there would be no real complicity in the act. 288

The Commentary of the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility adds some confusion on
the matter. In its Commentary, the ILC has explained that “there is no requirement that the
aid or assistance should have been essential to the performance of the internationally
wrongful act; it is sufficient if it contributed significantly to that act.” 289 Thus, it would
appear that significant contribution to the act is required. However, in another paragraph of
the Commentary on Article 16, the ILC provides that in some cases “the assistance may have
been only an incidental factor in the commission of the primary act, and may have
contributed only to a minor degree, if at all, to the injury suffered.” 290

Causality is also a relevant consideration in the discussion of contribution. The ILC has also
clearly stated that “the assisting State will only be responsible to the extend that its own
conduct has caused or contributed to the internationally wrongful act.”291 Thus, it has been
suggested that in determining what constitutes aid or assistance in Article 16, issues of
causality need to be taken into account.292 However, causality in international law is not a
straightforward concept, and thus it does not really clarify the confusion noted above. While
causality is relevant in the discussion, it is clear that any “but for” test of causality in
reference to complicity is not required. 293 In cases where a “but for” or condition sine qua
non circumstances are found, it may be more likely that independent responsibility of the
“assisting” State would be found,

294

as, if a State has itself primarily caused an

internationally wrongful act, why would it incur only derivative responsibility? However,
while “but for” causality may not be required, it is clear that some form of causality will be
necessary in questions of State complicity. 295

The above emphasises the fact that what constitutes aid or assistance within the meaning of
Article 16 is not all that clear.

Evidently, not all acts of assistance will apply: “it is

implausible that Article 16 should cover 'aid or assistance' which is only remotely or
'indirectly' related to an internationally wrongful act.” 296

It has been discussed that

contribution needs to be “significant” so as to “exclude any marginal participation”. 297 It has
also been stated that there must be some sort of special nexus between the aid and the
wrongful act (albeit, as noted above, the conduct need not be an essential “but for” condition
to the unlawful act taking place). 298 On assessment of what constitutes sufficient aid or
assistance in the context of ILC Article 16, Helmut Aust provided that “it does not appear to
be possible to provide abstract and normative criteria of what could constitute complicity in
each and every conceivable situation. Rather, the assessment whether the support a State is
rendering to another State constitutes aid or assistance within the meaning of Article 16 [of
the ILC Articles] needs to be established with respect to the facts of the specific case.” 299

5.7.2. MLA-Providing State’s Contribution to the Death Penalty

Thus, for the case at hand, if it were established that it is immaterial that death penalty is not
an unlawful act of the MLA-receiving State, it must still be established if provision of MLA
without obtaining death penalty assurances is sufficiently linked to the possibility of judicial
execution that abolitionist States would incur responsibility for assistance in the death
penalty.

Drawing on the discussions of complicity in torture, in a supplementary

memorandum to the JCHR, Philippe Sands stated that the contribution of the assisting State
must have a “substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime”.300 In the same report, the
JCHR also assessed and provided examples for what sort of conduct may constitute
complicity in torture, which would thus attract responsibility per Article 16 of the Articles on
State Responsibility. The JCHR provided that, among other examples, the following would
amount to complicity in torture: “The provision of information to […] a foreign intelligence
service enabling them to apprehend a terrorism suspect [who is then tortured].” 301 This is

relevant in the context of complicity in death penalty through provision of MLA, as parallels
can be drawn to between provision of information that leads to torture, and provision of
information that leads to death penalty. If the former amounts to complicity in torture, surely
the latter amounts to complicity in death penalty.

In the case at hand, provision of MLA without obtaining assurances that the death penalty
will not be imposed does not simply make it materially easier for the MLA-receiving State to
inflict harm on the individual concerned; in many cases, it may make it possible. 302 Thus, it
is submitted here that provision of MLA in the context of this study is conduct sufficiently
proximate to imposition of the death penalty by the latter State, and a form of “causality” in
such circumstances can be established.

The MLA provided, where the State specifically

does not obtain death penalty assurances, can have a substantial effect on the criminal
proceeding in question, and thus a substantial effect on the imposition of the death penalty.
This is exemplified by the importance of UK evidence in the case Maha Elgizouli, where
prosecution of El Sheikh in the US “depends critically on the evidence which has been
obtained by the British authorities”. 303 Thus, the position taken in this study is that provision
of MLA without obtaining assurances has a special nexus to judicial execution in a foreign
State, constituting sufficient “aid or assistance” to incur derivative responsibility in terms
stipulated by Article 16 of the Articles on State Responsibility.

6. Conclusion
This study has analysed whether abolitionist States party to the ICCPR and/or the ECHR are
prohibited from providing MLA to retentionist States for use in criminal proceedings which
may result in death penalty, in the absence of assurances that the death penalty will not be
imposed. When considering the extent to which abolitionist States can be held responsible in
these circumstances, we are presented with a complex web of international legal doctrine.
This study has considered how the relevant rules and principles operate and interact, with the
aim of determining the conditions in which abolitionist States may be held responsible for
facilitating the use of the death penalty through the provision of MLA.

At the outset, we have the primary rules and principles stemming from international human
rights law (in the context of this study, those derived from the ICCPR and, at the regional
level, from the ECHR). Running parallel to these rules are the ILC’s Articles on State
Responsibility, which direct when and how State action may entail the international
responsibility of that State. The ECtHR and the HRC rarely discuss the ILC Articles in their
judgments, and the “[t]he interplay between State responsibility under human rights law and
State responsibility under the ILC Articles is not straightforward, and has caused much
consternation for lawyers and commentators alike.”304 However, these frameworks are not
mutually exclusive, and thus this study has assessed the research question through a unified
perspective.

In the context of direct responsibility, the ILC Articles provide that “Every internationally
wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State”;305 and defines
that an act is internationally wrongful where: 1) the conduct is attributable to the State under
international law; and 2) the conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the
State. 306 Attribution of conduct to the abolitionist State in the context of this study will
generally be straightforward, as decisions to provide MLA stem from the abolitionist State’s
executive government. The more ambiguous element is that of subsection 2, whether there
exists an international obligation on abolitionist States to withhold provision of MLA in the
absence of adequate death penalty assurances.

Chapter 2 of this study assessed whether such an obligation can be discerned from the
existing human rights law codified in the ICCPR and the ECHR, and their relevant additional
protocols. This study examined vast parallels between the obligation on abolitionist States
not to extradite individuals to face the death penalty, and the (proposed) obligation not to
provide MLA which may assist imposition of the death penalty; arriving at the conclusion
that recognition of the latter obligation is a natural and inevitable extension of the former.
This conclusion is derived through uncovering the rationale of the HRC and ECtHR in
recognising the obligation in the extradition context, primarily through discerning and
analysing 1) the principle of non-facilitation of capital punishment; 2) the European
framework’s opposition to the death penalty “in all circumstances”; 3) the prohibition of
reintroduction of capital punishment; and 4) examining how relevant conventions, as “living
instruments”, have and may evolve.

If the obligation on abolitionist States to withhold MLA in the absence of death penalty
assurances was recognised, then, if a State proceeded to provide MLA without such
assurances, this act would amount to a breach of this international obligation (thus satisfying
Article 2(b) of the ILC Articles). This would, therefore, equate to an internationally wrongful
act, entailing the direct international responsibility of the abolitionist State.307

However, there are conceptual discrepancies between extradition and the provision of MLA,
which may prove fatal to recognising the international obligation asserted above.

As

discussed in Chapter 3, “Jurisdiction” in ECHR Article 1 and ICCPR Article 2(1), and in
their relevant respective additional protocols, functions to delimit the individuals to whom
States owe their human rights obligations (whereby State parties do not owe obligations to
anyone beyond their jurisdiction). This is problematic in the context of this study, as the
capital punishment-facing individual is not, and perhaps never was, in the territorial
jurisdiction of the MLA-providing State. Conversely, in extradition cases, while the risk of
death penalty is similarly located extraterritorially, the individual in question is, or was (in
reactive cases), within the territorial jurisdiction of the abolitionist State.

Therefore, a

jurisdictional link can be drawn in extradition cases, whereby the abolitionist State is
responsible for the conditions in which it forces the capital punishment-facing individual to
exit its borders.
307

While this may be so, it possible that existing categories of extraterritorial jurisdiction under
the ECHR and the ICCPR can be further defined to establish a jurisdictional link in the
context of this study. The abolitionist State’s involvement in the foreign criminal proceeding
can be argued to be an exercise of public powers in the retentionist State, whereby the MLAproviding State is producing effects extraterritorially. Moreover, the MLA-providing State
can be argued to be exercising power and control over the capital punishment-facing
individual, as “[t]he authorities are certainly exercising jurisdiction over the essential legal
interests of the person regardless of their physical location.”308

Furthermore, there is also

room to argue that “jurisdictional limits need not be determinative of the scope of abolitionist
States' […] obligations to refrain from facilitating the use of the death penalty elsewhere.”309
The argument here is that States should not be disposing of their own adopted laws and
policies on human rights protection on a purely mechanical level. 310

Ultimately, if jurisdiction cannot be established in the circumstances of this study, then the
direct responsibility of the abolitionist State also cannot be established. However, provision
of MLA under the circumstances of this study may, rather, be viewed as complicity in the
death penalty, thus entailing the derivative, as opposed to primary, responsibility of the
abolitionist State. The interplay between human rights law and the ILC Articles in the
context of complicity is equally complex. The ILC Articles position on complicity is as
follows:
“A State which aids or assists another State in the commission of an internationally
wrongful act by the latter is internationally responsible for doing so if: (a) that State
does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and
(b) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State.”311

A purely textual reading of Article 16 and its accompanying commentary would prove fatal
for the claim that abolitionist States are complicit in the death penalty in the circumstances of
this study, as: 1) the act (death penalty) is not likely to be internationally wrongful for the

capital punishment-imposing State;312 2) it would be rare that the abolitionist State intends to
facilitate the death penalty through its conduct (and even if it did, this would be arduous to
prove); 313 and 3) the allegedly wrongful act may never actually eventuate (whereby
responsibility could not ensue upon the act of providing MLA despite a foreseeable risk of
death penalty, and rather would only ensue upon capital punishment actually being
imposed).314

However, the ILC Articles have a dynamic relationship with the broader international legal
framework. As provided by Article 55 of the ILC Articles, relevant primary rules pertaining
to the law of complicity in the death penalty take precedence over Article 16 (as lex
specialis), and thus may remedy the aforementioned limits of the Article. Relevant primary
rules in this area can be argued to be more “far reaching” than Article 16’s formulation of
complicity. 315

Thus, the argument presented Chapter 5 is that Article 16 of the ILC Articles can be bolstered
by the lex specialis on complicity in the use of death penalty, to overcome the
aforementioned limits of the Article, and thus enabling recognition of the derivate
responsibility of abolitionist States for provision of MLA without requisite assurances.
Relevant lex specialis can be located in the “obligation to protect”, the concepts of complicity
located in other areas of human rights law, the obligation to refrain from imposing the death
penalty, and the prohibition of extradition to face the death penalty. Consequently, this study
arrives at the conclusion that, despite the legality of capital punishment in the sanctionimposing State, and in spite of the likely lack of intent of the MLA-providing State to assist
the imposition of the death penalty, and regardless of whether or not capital punishment
eventually materialises, abolitionist States may be found responsible for their “aid and
assistance” in the death penalty through their provision of MLA.

act by the latter” (italics added).

ILC Commentary to Article 16, para. 3: the aid/assistance must be given “with a view of facilitating the
commission of that act.” The ILC elaborates on this at para. 5: stating that the aiding State will not be
responsible under Article 16 unless the State organ concerned intended, by the assistance given, to facilitate the
occurrence of the wrongful conduct.

Accordingly, this study considers that it is time to recognise that abolitionist States party to
the ECHR and/or the ICCPR are prohibited from providing MLA for use in foreign
proceedings that may result in death penalty, in the absence of adequate assurances that
capital punishment will not be imposed. At its core, the reasoning is simple: to do otherwise
would amount to facilitating a practice which is forbidden for that State.316 The author sees
no compelling reason to sustain the artificial divide between extradition and provision of
MLA in the circumstances of this study. The same legal reasoning should apply here as in
the transfer of persons: “states that have abolished capital punishment may not assist in
bringing about the death penalty in other countries.”317

In asserting the above, this study closes with the following statement by Lord Kerr in the
Supreme Court judgment of Maha Elgizouli, where His Honour expressed his minority view
that the law has in fact developed so as to prohibit abolitionist States from providing MLA to
retentionist States in context examined in this thesis:
“Law, [...] if it is operating as it should, must be responsive to society’s
contemporary needs, standards and values. It is a commonplace that these are in a
state of constant change. That is an essential part of the human condition and
experience. As a deeper understanding of the human psyche and the enlightenment of
society increase with the onward march of education, tolerance and forbearance in
relation to our fellow citizens, the law must march step-by-step with that progress. I
am convinced that the adjustment to the […] law which I propose reflects the
contemporary standards and values of our society.”318
