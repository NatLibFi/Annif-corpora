Title: Accounting, Auditing and Blockchain - Interviews with Finnish auditors about
blockchain
Supervisor: Ralf Östermark
Abstract:
Blockchain technology is something that is often mentioned in the same context as
bitcoin. The technology in question has, by some, been touted as the fourth industrial
revolution, which will change how we conduct business.
There exists a lot of academic articles on what benefits blockchain could provide for
accounting and auditing, but very few studies that have been conducted with asking
what the auditors themselves think of the technology. This is the first study of its kind in
Finland, and with Finns tending to be early adopters of technology, consulting
professionals in Finland can be considered a good idea.
This thesis serves as an analysis on blockchain knowledge among auditors in Finland.
The auditors that partook in the interview were divided into three groups, which had
different amounts of work experience. This allows for the study to get a good range of
opinions on the technology, from both new auditors and experienced auditors.
The results of this thesis show, that the auditors in Finland were aware of blockchain
technology, but most were not exactly aware of in what way it can help. When further
explored, the majority did think it could provide some benefits, especially when it
comes to smart contracts. However, the main principles of immutability did not
completely convince the auditors, as the information entered could be manipulated
before it reached the blockchain.

1. Introduction
Although much of the interest around blockchain the previous years has been
focused on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their skyrocketing prices and
subsequent downfall in value, there is an inherent value in the underlying technology
of blockchain. According to industry leaders, blockchain, which is a decentralized
digital ledger, could be considered the fourth industrial revolution. It is an entirely
new way of performing business and related functions, such as accounting and
auditing.
While double entry accounting has proven to be versatile and has been credited in
allowing companies to grow, prosper and spread around the world, it does have
drawbacks which are not often discussed, with one of these being security (Carlin,
2018). We have managed to computerize accounting well, but it is only a
computerized version of double-entry accounting and has not evolved to take
advantage of computers. Just as double entry accounting on paper, computerized
systems are open to fraud and potential abuse (Carlin, 2018). The suggested triple
entry accounting that blockchain provides could potentially minimize these issues
through providing a third entry, a cryptographic signature of the transaction (Grigg,
2005). Each and every transaction now has a unique and immutable identifier, which
can be traced back to its point of origin and who authorized it (Grigg, 2005).
With people believing that blockchain is the fourth industrial revolution, major
changes in a multitude of industries are expected. For example, supply-chain
records would be immune to tampering, and records would always show the true
point of origin (IBM, 2018a). Accelerating cross-border transactions and remittances
is currently under way, with Alibaba Cloud and other financial services showing
interest in using blockchain technology for this expressed purpose (Alibaba Cloud,
2018; Santander Bank, 2018). Banks are also exploring the possibilities of
blockchain, Nordea and other banks have launched WeTrade, which is a finance
trading platform, which works on blockchain technology provided by IBM, called
Hyperledger (IBM, 2018b). In the medical industry, companies are exploring the
possibility of encrypting patient records, sealing them and keeping them safe in a
tamperproof environment, in addition to being able to have all the changes traceable
(Deloitte, 2018).

2

There is active development and research into how blockchain could be utilized.
Among those who have been researching the potential of blockchain technology are
the Big 5 accounting companies (i.e. Deloitte, EY, KPMG, BDO and PwC). As an
example, both KPMG and Deloitte have been researching how blockchain could help
accountants and auditors create a more secure and efficient accounting/auditing
environment (Deloitte, 2016; KPMG, 2018a).
PwC France is currently working together with a blockchain start-up called “Request
Network”, who are developing a blockchain accounting solution (PwC, 2018).
Factom is another company working on how to implement audit trails on the
blockchain (Deery, Lu, Johnston, & Kirby, 2018). One of the significant developers
working on accounting on the blockchain is the Ethereum based “Consensys”
foundation, which is developing an accounting suite called “Balanc3” which operates
on the Ethereum blockchain network (Balanc3, 2017). Other organizations have
sprung up to further the development and adoption of accounting on the blockchain,
the largest one currently is called the “Accounting Blockchain Coalition”, which has
representatives from the Big 5 accounting companies (ABC). SWIFT, which is the
de-facto standard in secure transmission between financial institutions, is working
together with R3 to improve speed and security (CNBC, 2019).
Whether blockchain is the future of accounting is still uncertain but considering many
famous institutions that are active in accounting and auditing have expressed
interest in blockchain, it is important for academics of accounting to view the
potential disruptions and changes it could bring.
A word list has been provided on page 67 that explains key terms used throughout
this thesis.

1.1. Problem Discussion
1.1.1. General Background
Yet, there is a need for some extensive studies on whether accounting or auditing on
the blockchain is worth pursuing, or if it is something auditors and accountants here
in Finland are interested in. The Big 5 accounting companies abroad have publicly
expressed interest in the application of blockchain in both accounting and auditing,
but little academic research has been conducted. The belief of some of the Big 5 is
that blockchain would make accounting much more streamlined, as well as helping

3

auditors decrease their workloads and automate many of the simple processes that
take up a lot of time (Deloitte, 2016). All Big 5 accounting firms have their own
blockchain labs where they are experimenting with the technology, and some have
already released working products based on blockchain (KPMG, 2016). However,
the single most important factor for all the Big 5 accounting companies seems to be
the transparency that blockchains could potentially offer.

1.1.2. Specific Problems
As mentioned in the introduction, many of the fraud scandals in accounting have
been caused by shortcomings and flaws in the double-entry bookkeeping, and the
lack of transparency (Grigg, 2005). Accounting has been similar for almost 700
years at this point, and technology has been advancing rapidly, but accounting has
remained the same, only the medium it is conducted on has changed from paper to
the computer. It has been suggested that blockchain could potentially decrease the
fraud risk by being a trustless network. On average fraud loss is USD 2.75 million
dollars, according to the Association for Certified Fraud Examiners (2019), in their
2018 report. The most common one being asset misappropriation and the most
devastating one being financial statement manipulation (ACFE, 2019). In other
words, there is a need for a more fraud proof system, and blockchain might solve
that problem.
EY has the belief that blockchain will have the same impact as enterprise resource
planning systems (ERP) have had on the world (EY, 2017). Blockchain would
increase transparency in the organization and potentially eliminate many of the
intermediaries. This in turn would help reduce fraud through “enhanced identity
management” as EY calls it (EY, 2018a). KPMG also believes that blockchain could
be used to help reduce fraud at companies, due to its immutable and transparent
structure (KPMG, 2018b). Any strange transactions would have an easy audit trail to
follow (KPMG, 2018b).
Considering the benefits that blockchains could provide, the opinions of auditors are
important to hear.

1.2. Purpose of Thesis
The purpose of this thesis is to measure the receptibility of accountants and auditors
in Finland on whether the Finnish market is interested and aware of accounting and
auditing on the blockchain. Since auditors are experts in both these areas, their
opinions are important for any future developments in these fields.
There has not been almost any public discussion on accounting and auditing on
blockchain in Finland, this study will try to remedy that situation. No studies of this
kind have so far been made in Finland and in general this is one of the very few
studies that have been conducted on what auditors themselves think of blockchain.
As the technology is new, the assumption is that only few know about it, but the
questions that will be asked might provoke thoughts about the future of accounting
and auditing.

1.3. Structure
The structure of the thesis is as follows: It will open with an introduction where the
basic premise of triple entry accounting is explained, and how it can help solve some
of the shortcomings that have been linked to double entry accounting. After this the
purpose of the thesis is explained and the structure for the thesis is laid out. The
second chapter serves as an explanation on what triple entry accounting is, what
blockchain is, how it works and what forms of blockchains exist. The chapter is
meant to serve as a primer for those who are not aware of how blockchain
technology works.
The third chapter is a literature review on blockchain and accounting, as well as
auditing and smart contracts. The last part of the chapter is dedicated to explaining
some of the drawbacks and disadvantages of blockchains when coupled with
accounting and auditing functions.
The fourth chapter is dedicated to the methodology of the thesis, where the research
method is explained and the questions that will be used are presented. In this
chapter the hypothesis for the thesis will also be presented which questions are
going to be asked.

5

The fifth chapter will be used to present the findings of the interviews that were
conducted. The purpose of the questions will be explained, and why these questions
are relevant for this study.
The sixth chapter will serve as a conclusion for the thesis where the results will be
discussed and ending remarks will be made. In this chapter future research will also
be potentially suggested.

2. Theory
This chapter focuses on explaining the basics of some of the fundamentals of
blockchain, as well as explaining why some believe that blockchain would be
conducive in transforming accounting to a more fraud-proof format. The goal of this
chapter is to build a foundation for people who are not knowledgeable on what
blockchain (and distributed ledger technology) is and explain the basic concepts.
Additionally, the reader will also get a brief explanation and introduction to what
smart contracts are. At the end of this chapter, the reader should have a basic
understanding on blockchain and smart contracts.

2.1. Triple Entry Accounting
2.1.1. Accounting History
The concept of triple entry accounting was first introduced by Ian Grigg (2005), and
is not to be confused with another concept called momentum accounting which is
also sometimes referred to as triple entry accounting. Triple entry accounting in the
context of Ian Grigg, is accounting with three entries, one extra in the addition to the
traditional two (Grigg, 2005). However, before discussing more about triple entry
accounting, it is worth looking at the history of accounting, and how it has evolved to
what it is today.
Single-entry accounting was invented around 5000 years ago in Babylon. This is the
simplest and most basic form of accounting that exists (Alrawi & Ambashe, 2018;
Cîndea, Cîndea, Ciurariu, Trifu, & Durdureanu, 2011). In single-entry accounting one
creates a list of assets or debts, and when an asset is bought or a debt is incurred, it
is added to the list, and when the asset is sold, or the debt is paid, it is removed from
the list (Grigg, 2005). The single-entry system works well for the most basic needs;
however, it is not sustainable for anything but the most basic lists. One of the issues
with single entry, is that mistakes can easily occur without noticing them much later,
as well as it being easy to manipulate. The reason for single-entry accounting being
easy to both manipulate and why it is prone to errors is in its construction, it is a
simple list. If liabilities and assets are being recorded on a simple list, there is no true
verification that your assets and liabilities are in balance (Grigg, 2005). When one is
unsure whether the error is simply an error or, if it is a case of fraud, the situation can

7

become quite severe. Single-entry accounting was used for around 4400 years, until
the invention of double-entry accounting.
Double-entry accounting is said to have been invented in the 15th century by a
Venetian friar by the name of Luca Pacioli (Cîndea et al., 2011). It is often
speculated that the invention of double-entry accounting is what allowed the
Venetian merchants to flourish in wealth and trading, as well as dominate in trading
around the world. Eventually, double-entry accounting spread to the rest of the world
and became the predominate and only way of conducting accounting (Cîndea et al.,
2011).
Simply put, in double entry accounting a transaction generates both a debit and
credit event. As an example, when someone purchases inventory or products there
is a debit transaction in the inventory and a credit transaction in the bank account.
The obvious benefit of double-entry accounting is that every transaction creates two
events that cancel out each other. This in turn translates onto the balance sheet,
where we can see whether our accounting balances. When credit and debit eliminate
each other, the balance sheet will balance itself out. However, if for some reason
there no longer is a balance, the error can be located quicker and easier, when
compared to single entry accounting. In general errors are easier to find, and
manipulation as well as fraud is harder to execute (Carlin, 2018).
However, as great as double-entry accounting is, it still has flaws. Many of the
accounting scandals in the past decades have been caused indirectly and directly by
some of the inadequacies and shortfalls of double-entry accounting. Most of these
are related to fabricated verifications and transactions, which allows fraudulent
transactions to slip through the internal controls (Grigg, 2005). These inadequacies
are often mitigated through audits that are conducted on a regular basis. These,
however, are also prone to error, but it is better to have a control measure to try and
prevent mistakes from occurring. Audits have not prevented large scale frauds from
happening either.

2.1.2. Principles of Triple Entry Accounting
Triple-entry accounting expands the principle of double-entry accounting, by adding
a third entry, “the receipt”. According to Ian Grigg (2005), transferring double entry
accounting from paper to computers has not been as efficient as desired.

8

Computerized accounting systems still rely on double-entry accounting that was
meant to be done in paper form. Ian Grigg (2005) argues that we are not taking full
advantage of accounting on computers since the power given by computers is not
leveraged. Instead of trying to adapt double-accounting entry for computers, we
should focus on creating a new form of accounting that is meant for computer use
and will use computer science to make it more secure and efficient.
Triple-entry accounting, as its name suggests, has three entries: debit, credit and the
receipt. These three entries are divided among three different parties, the payer,
issuer and payee. The payer is the person initiating the payment, the issuer is the
verifier and signer of the payment, and the payee is the person receiving the
payment (Grigg, 2005). A theoretical scenario where person A is going to pay person
B, explains the potential system well: When person A pays person B, it passes
through an intermediary called C. The intermediary C confirms that the payment has
been received by B and produces a receipt of the transaction and sends it to both
parties. (Grigg, 2005)

Figure 1 Example of what the third entry could look like. Grigg 2005

9

The receipt includes the entire transaction, from both the perspective of the sender
and recipient, as well as the so called “digital signature” of who both parties. The
digital signature, as Grigg (2005) explains, can be seen as signing a cheque or
signing a document with a personal cryptographic key. In today’s world, the receipt is
the dominating proof that a transaction has occurred, for example going to the store
and purchasing an item and you get a receipt for your purchase. Not only does the
receipt work as evidence that you bought an item, but it also safeguards the shop
owners from potential fraud by employees.
One of the largest drawbacks of Grigg’s model (2005) is the requirement of a neutral,
trusted or an independent third-party who is assigned to verify the transactions, and
in the previous example that would be C. A human element as a third-party verifier
makes it vulnerable to exploitation and therefore should not be pursued. A third-party
verifier themselves could become corrupted and act in their own self-interest, be a
target of cyberattacks and more.
However, since the time of writing his article in 2005, technology that could make it
feasible to have a trusted third-party acting as a verifier, has come a long way. A
technology named blockchain was introduced in 2008, and it might change how we
interact with

2.2. Blockchain
The concept of blockchain technology comes from a whitepaper written by a person
or group using the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto”. This whitepaper was called
“Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system” and was the presentation of a
decentralized computer protocol by the name of “Bitcoin”. The primary purpose for
the creation of bitcoin, was to offer another alternative to the traditional financial
system and circumvent the third parties that work as a middle hand for transactions,
through creating a “trustless” financial system. Nakamoto (2008) explains the
problem with the current financial system as follows
“The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical
transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there
is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for
nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.
Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than

10
they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as
unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by
using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a
communications channel without a trusted party.”

A trustless financial system is self-explanatory; it is a financial system that works
without trust, and for bitcoin to be able to work on a trustless level, an underlying
technology was created, the “blockchain” (Nakamoto, 2008).
Blockchain technology is a digital ledger that is decentralized, a centralized
blockchain would be a normal database. A blockchain is a collection of records,
same as a ledger, but spread across a distributed network of computers, which are
called nodes (Kokina, Mancha, & Pachamanova, 2017). Every computer on the
distributed network has the exact same information as any other, and they all work
together to verify that the information on the network is correct. Once a transaction
on the blockchain has been approved and recorded, it can no longer be altered, the
information becomes immutable. In the case of bitcoin, it uses the processing power
of computers to verify the transaction, in something called “mining”.

Figure 2 Illustration of networks (Baran, 1964)

Mining is the creation and verification of the blocks in the blockchain, which are the
entries in the blockchain that can be seen by the entire distributed network. Before a
block is added and approved to the network, the information in the block is validated

11

by the nodes, and when they reach “consensus” it is appended to the blockchain in a
chronological order to establish a continuous record (Kokina et al., 2017; Zheng, Xie,
Dai, Chen, & Wang, 2018). Information in a block can theoretically be anything;
transaction information, products, health records and more (Kokina et al., 2017).
The name blockchain comes from the structure of the records. Every block has
information that ties back to the previous block, which allows it to become a chain of
immutable ledger of transactions (Kokina et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018). If the
distributed network detects an error in the information, it will not validate the block,
and it will not be added to blockchain. The real nature of the decentralization allows it
to work without trust, since there is no central authority, but instead the miners and
their nodes on the network all work together to verify the authenticity of the
transactions.

Figure 3 Example of transactions on a blockchain

In the above example, we can see a simplified example on how blocks on a
blockchain functions like, and what information it can contain. The blocks are each
linked to the previous block, and in the blocks, we can see the transactions that were
confirmed and verified to have happened during that verification time limit. The
information that has been stored on the blockchain is immutable and unalterable,
unless a successful attack is launched against it (Zheng et al., 2018). These attacks
will be explained in a later chapter.
The creation of a block requires the solving of a cryptographic puzzle, which means
the solving of a “nonce”. The efficiency of the network is measured in “hashing
power”, which comes from the amount of power the entire distributed network is
using to solve the puzzles and create new blocks (Kokina et al., 2017).

12

Incentivizing people to participate in the creation of blocks is important, and that is
where mining comes in. In the case of the “Proof-of-work” consensus mechanism,
miners who create the new blocks must lend their computers to mine the new blocks
(usually through using their GPUs or CPUs, but other methods exist as well)
(Gabison, ). By participating in the creation/discovery/verification of the block they
receive a reward. When mining Bitcoin for example, when a block is found by
miners, all those who participated in mining the block are rewarded with bitcoin.
Those who lend more computer power to mining the network, are rewarded with
more bitcoin. Mining also works as a form of spam protection, since mining costs
resources (time and power), people who want to use the network maliciously or
attack it, need to invest in capabilities to overpower all the other users on the
network.
This is where triple-entry accounting meets the blockchain. One of the shortcomings
of the suggestion by Griggs (2005), was that a third party should be in control of
approving transactions. However, this is a potential point of failure, as there is no
guarantee that a person will not be influenced or that they are secure against
cyberattacks (Grigg, 2005). The blockchain solves the third-party issue, since in
theory it should be completely decentralized and distributed. No single person can
have control over the network and make it go against the will of the other nodes, as
the consensus mechanism will prevent this from happening. But this brings us to
another question, whether the blockchain should be open to everyone or open only
to those that have been verified by a central authority, in other words what the
different structures of blockchains are.

2.3. Blockchain Structure
A permissioned blockchain is a blockchain where users are selected by a central
authority on whether they should be allowed to participate on the network. This is
theorized to be how organizations will want to have their blockchains used, as they
then may control who can participate on the network (Feng, He, Zeadally, Khan, &
Kumar, 2018). This in turn means that they can keep the network secure and private
from outsiders (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). However, this can lead to situations where
someone gains access through a permissioned users’ credentials to the internal
network, and hence they might execute attacks that can render the information on

13

the blockchain unusable or copy the information on the blockchain. Permissioned
blockchains usually have less users than permissionless blockchains and this fact
might expose the blockchain to these kinds of situations.
These permissioned blockchains are also sometimes known as consortium
blockchains, one example is IBM’s Hyperledger (Zheng et al., 2018). Consortium
blockchains are specifically aimed at organizations that want to use blockchain, but
which do not want to develop their own blockchain solution in-house, and instead opt
to use a pre-existing network.
A permissionless, or public blockchain is for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum, where
anyone that wants to participate, can participate (Feng et al., 2018). This allows for
large networks to be created, where there is a much larger certainty that no single
entity has control of the entire network. This does come with some drawbacks
though, namely privacy and speed. If a blockchain is permissionless, it is open for
everyone to use and therefore all information on the blockchain can be seen by
everyone (Feng et al., 2018). Although we can see only hashes of sending and
receiving addresses (called pseudonyms), it does not mean it is impossible to figure
out who is behind the pseudonym (Feng et al., 2018). In contrast to bank accounts
where transactions are seen by only parties that are interacting with each other, all
transactions on the permissionless blockchain are visible to everyone (Feng et al.,
2018).
Another issue is speed, which often referred to as “scalability” (Dai & Vasarhelyi,
2017). The current speed of the Bitcoin network is seven transactions per second
(tps), and for a small company this should not be an issue. However, scaled up to a
large corporation or a globally spanning one, speed will become an issue.
Permissionless and highly decentralized blockchain networks often have a lower tps.
When the blockchain is centralized the speed increases (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017).
The problem is that this goes against the decentralization that blockchains provide,
and instead becomes a centralized database. There are some consensus forms that
allow for a more centralized approach, but keeping it decentralized to certain degree.
These consensus mechanisms will be presented closer in chapter 2.3.1.

14

The final form of blockchain is the private blockchain, where the entire network is
under the control of one entity (Zheng et al., 2018). This is where one could start
questioning whether it is in fact anymore a blockchain or a centralized database. The
private blockchain could have a very fast tps rate but is most at risk for insider
attacks.
Different blockchains serve different purposes and function in different ways. For
example, Bitcoin and its blockchain are meant to be used a currency, while
Ethereum, the third largest cryptocurrency, works as fuel for the its blockchain
network. Ethereum also includes tokens, which fuel decentralized applications
(Zheng et al., 2018). To be able to participate, to send or receive a currency or a
token on a blockchain, a “wallet” is needed. One could think of the wallet as bank
account, or digital wallet. In this wallet you store your currencies and tokens. There
are two key items to using a blockchain wallet, the “public key” and the “private
key”(Zheng et al., 2018). The public key is the address cryptocurrencies are being
sent to, which can be compared to IBAN or any other similar bank account
identification number. The private key is a cryptographic key that is used to access
your wallet and allows you to execute actions (Zheng et al., 2018). If you would want
to move funds from wallet “A” to “B”, you would first need to know the public key of
wallet B (Zheng et al., 2018). After you have received the public key for the wallet
you are sending cryptocurrencies to, you must now enter your private key linked to
the wallet you are using to send the cryptocurrency. By entering your private key into
wallet “A”, you have now authorized and signed the transaction.

Figure 4 Example of Public Address on Bitcoin

The private key is akin to the digital signature Ian Grigg mentioned in his paper on
triple entry accounting (Grigg, 2005). By entering a personal private key, the
transaction is signed and approved by the blockchain. Every private key is a unique
cryptographic key that is used to approve transactions on the network (Zheng et al.,
2018). The blockchain confirms the transaction is correct and authorizes it. It is
important to be aware, that private keys are meant to be private, and not shared. If a
private key ends up in the wrong hands, losing all funds is a real and dangerous
possibility.

2.3.1. Consensus
As mentioned in the previous chapter, there exists multiple ways of forming
consensus on a blockchain network. Among these are proof-of-work, proof-of-stake,
proof-of-burning, and many more (Gramoli, 2017). The purpose of these consensus
mechanisms is to reach a consensus by all participants on what should be done with
each block. This is what gives the blockchain its trustless form, no centralized entity
is deciding on what should be done next. Therefore, it is important that the most
common ones are explained, to give a better understanding what some of the
benefits and drawbacks, and which companies interested in blockchain uses might
be looking at.
Proof-of-work (PoW) is the most famous example, which was created for Bitcoin
(Kokina et al., 2017). A large decentralized computer network with nodes is tasked
with mining blocks to further the blockchain by offering their power to solve
cryptographic puzzles. Miners are the people who lend their GPUs or CPUs to
conduct the verification of the blocks, and they are rewarded by the amount of
hashing power they input to the network.
There are drawbacks with a consensus mechanism like proof-of-work. One of these
is the required amount of power to run a blockchain network with this consensus
mechanism (Kokina et al., 2017). As the number of participants on the network
increases, there is more hardware solving cryptographic calculations, which in turn
means that the difficulty of the calculations increases. As the hardware required to
solve the calculations becomes more advanced, the required power to operate the
blockchain increases, which can lead to a strain on the environment. In other words,
from an environmental perspective, proof-of-work is not the best option (Truby,
2018). Another issue that is related to this form of consensus mechanism is the so
called 51-percent attack (alternatively called majority hashrate attack) (Gramoli,
2017). The name of the attack implies that a party or an entity manages to capture
51 percent of the entire networks hashing power and is now the majority owner of
the entire network. One of the practical benefits of a proof-of-work network, is that an
attack like the 51-percent attack requires a considerable amount of power, which
translates into a significant expenses for the attacker (Lai & LEE Kuo Chuen, 2018).
A 51-percent attack is a rare occurrence, especially on a public network, due to the
amount of computing power that is required to gain most of the hashing rate.

16

However, if someone did manage to successfully execute a 51-percent attack, the
blockchain would be compromised and information should not be trusted before an
independent analysis could confirm the status of the information on the blockchain.
A 51-percent attack allows one to overcome the mutability of the blockchain by
allowing alterations of the previous blocks. This is a resource intensive task, as it
requires one to recalculate the previous blocks. If the information one wants to alter
is in block 20, and the current block is 200, it would mean they have to recalculate
180 blocks to be able to alter the information.
Proof-of-stake (hereafter PoS) is another form of consensus mechanism and works
entirely differently to proof-of-work. Instead of using computer’s CPU or GPU to
solve cryptographic puzzles, the number of tokens you hold grants you more power
over the network. By using PoS, there is hope that the costs of running a blockchain
would dramatically decrease. A PoS blockchain does not require GPUs or CPUs to
mine blocks but are instead validated by nodes that hold a certain amount. This is
the reason they are named “forgers” instead of miners since they forge a block into
existence. In general, the amount of currency or token that one holds on the PoS
blockchain, gives one more control over the network. This in turn means that you
also receive more rewards for the forging that is done. In the case of a PoS
blockchains, the reward constitutes of the transaction fees from the transactions
made on the network during the forging period. Ethereum is currently a PoW
blockchain but is planning on moving to a PoS system in the future. The danger of
the PoS consensus method is that, since the cost of mining/forging is near to zero,
attacks on the network would become easier to perform. False “stake” attacks are a
possibility, which means that the attacker fakes the size of their stake. Other coins
and blockchains have suggested other ways of mitigating the danger of attacks
through proof-of-activity, where a certain number of miners need to sign and verify
the creation of the block. This would prevent a total control of the network, as they
could not singlehandedly create the blocks, even if they would own 50% of the entire
stake of the network (Zheng et al., 2018).
Delegated proof-of-stake (hereafter DPoS) is a variation of proof-of-stake but is more
centralized. Instead of allowing anyone to participate in the network, only people
voted in (or selected) can vote/participate in the creation of blocks (Zheng et al.,

17

2018). One of the big contentions with DPoS is the centralization of nodes, potential
collusion and vote buying. Blockchains that utilize DPoS usually have better tps rate,
as there is less decentralization (Zheng et al., 2018).
Practical byzantine fault tolerance (hereafter PBFT) requires that all the participants
of the network are known. This is the consensus mechanism that Hyperledger, IBM’s
consortium blockchain, uses (Linux Foundation, 2018). In the PBFT it is assumed
that the number of nodes that are malicious do not exceed 1/3 of all nodes (Zheng et
al., 2018). The more nodes are on the network, the less the chance of malicious
nodes taking over the network. However, it is still prone to sybil attacks (also known
as 51-percent attacks), where a party can gain or create several identities and gain
majority of the network.
Proof-of-burn is a consensus method where a small number of tokens is discarded
after every transaction, as a mechanism to verify that a transaction truly has
occurred. This is one of the most environmentally friendly forms of consensus
mechanism, as it does not require you to own the cryptocurrency. Instead, whenever
a transaction happens, a small number of tokens or cryptocurrencies are sent to a
discard address, often called “burned tokens”. By sending these burnt tokens to the
discard address, it verifies that the transaction indeed has indeed occurred.

2.4. Smart Contracts
For many people smart contracts are one of the most interesting features on the
blockchain. Smart contracts are not “smart” or independently thinking contracts, but
pre-programmed computer programs that fulfill an action when pre-determined
conditions are met. These contracts were first mentioned by Nick Szabo (1994). The
idea of a smart contract is to automate simple and repetitive tasks or to have them
monitor certain conditions and then execute when the condition has been met. There
is an ongoing debate whether these computer programs in fact should be called
“smart contracts”, but no consensus has yet been reached.
Smart contracts are not a foundational part of the blockchain structure but more an
addition. Initially bitcoin had a very rudimentary and simple smart contract system,
and smart contracts were more properly integrated after Ethereum was introduced
by Vitalik Buterin (2013). According to Buterin (2013), smart contracts are:

18
“systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified
rules.”

Buterin (2013) also mentions that smart contracts can run autonomous
organizations, also known as DAO’s (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
These organizations are autonomous organizations that are completely run and built
on smart contracts and need minimal human interaction to function.
The largest strength of smart contracts is the ability to be cost-efficient, by removing
intermediaries. By getting rid of intermediaries, such as banks and credit providers
and the like, the process of transactions is speeded up by having it autonomously
execute them (Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018).
Smart contracts come in several sizes and shapes. For example a smart contract
can be a simple program for paying the rent for an apartment, or there could be a
smart contract that hedges oil prices or monitors the stock market and sells stocks at
a certain price (Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018). After the introduction of smart contracts
on Ethereum, many other platforms have been created to compete with Ethereum.
All the blockchains operate in different ways and solving different problems.
As the functions of blockchains have been explained, it is worth looking at how these
can be applied to accounting and auditing. This will be expanded upon in chapter 3,
previous studies and literature.

19

3. Previous Studies and Literature
This chapter focuses on studies made on blockchain and their impact on both
accounting and auditing. Blockchain is fairly new technology, which in turn means
there has not been much previous research conducted in this area. Most studies
focus on auditing and how their job descriptions will change. One of the reasons for
this could be that the changes to accounting are more technically oriented. The
chapter also looks at how smart contracts are a part of the blockchain ecosystem
and how they might impact accounting and auditing. This chapter will also look at
studies that explore the potential downsides of using blockchain in an accounting
and auditing environment.

3.1. Accounting on the Blockchain
As previously discussed, the basic principle of accounting the blockchain is triple
entry accounting. In triple entry accounting we have three different entries: credit,
debit and the third entry, the receipt. Instead of using a neutral third party as required
in Griggs (2005) suggestion, the blockchain is used. The largest issue with using a
neutral third party are the guarantee that the third party will stay neutral, that
information is not lost, nor that the data are potential targets of cyberattacks (Grigg,
2005). When a transaction occurs on the blockchain, a receipt is created. This is
stored on the blockchain and all parties involved in the transaction can see it (and if it
is a public blockchain everyone can see it).
Deloitte (2016) explained in a research study how blockchain accounting could
potentially change the way we perceive accounting. They state that instead of having
separate registers for all records (invoices, receipts and more), everything can be
written into blockchain transactions which would work as a joint register and would
thus become “an interlocking system of enduring accounting records” (Deloitte,
2016). These records are then, as previously mentioned, cryptographically sealed (or
encrypted), which means that any form of tampering would be noticed and would
leave a trace. Another Big 5 company, EY, has stated that the use of blockchain
would make transactions easy to follow, from point of origin to end (EY, 2016). Both
Deloitte and EY emphasize that by using blockchain, all transactions have a shared
ledger, where confirming accuracy is made simpler. Another benefit with a shared

20

ledger is through reconciliation, which according to EY, makes companies lose “50
and 100 working days” in reconciling differences (EY, 2016).
Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017) have an example of what a potential blockchain
accounting solution could be like. Every debit and credit transaction within an
organization would create a blockchain entry, which is included in the traditional
double-entry accounting system. Transactions in the blockchain are recorded as
token transfers between the different blockchain accounts.
In this case, a token is a so-called tokenization of an asset or value (Dai &
Vasarhelyi, 2017). Instead of being a real asset that is booked on the blockchain, it is
a representation of the asset. For example, the transactions we mentioned before
are only token transfers between the blockchain wallets, and in this token is the
information of the transaction that occurred between the real-world accounts, what
the asset actually was and the reason for the transfer. Tokenized assets can be
almost anything; securities, commodities, gold, buildings and so forth (EY, 2018b).
These are sometimes called “colored coins”.
Perhaps the largest benefit of accounting on the blockchain would be immutability,
which in its turn can be a drawback. Once information has been entered onto the
blockchain, the information cannot be altered, and this can be verified by looking at
the hashes (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). If the hashes on the blockchain entries are
different from before, information has been altered. However, if wrong information is
entered onto the blockchain, changing it becomes more difficult as it is “appended”
only.
Prevention or deterrence of fraud would also be efficient due to the design of the
blockchain. If someone wants to alter or remove accounting records, he would have
to know which block contains the information he wants, that is pertinent to his cause,
and after this you need to recalculate and verify this block (Appelbaum & Nehmer,
2017). In itself this is already computationally expensive, since it requires majority
control over the network, but as an example: if the block that they want to change is
block number 357, and the current block is number 438, they would need to
recompute every hash between block 357 and block 438, and if any new blocks are
appended to the chain, they will have to calculate those as well, increasing the
workload for the attacker (Appelbaum & Nehmer, 2017).

21

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and Chartered
Professional Accountants of Canada are also looking into the development of
blockchain and educating their members on the basics of what a blockchain is and
how it might affect accounting and auditing (AICPA, 2017).
Other suggestions have been to incorporate blockchain into ERP systems that would
give companies an easy way to conduct accounting on the blockchain (Dai &
Vasarhelyi, 2017). By incorporating a blockchain solution into how an already
existing ERP system would make it easier to transition from an organization-wide
perspective (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). In a scenario like this, the entire system would
not have to be replaced, only the accounting infrastructure would be upgraded. This
of course does not mean they could avoid large scale investments, as it very much
depends on the architecture of the blockchain they have decided to use. A way to
avoid or mitigate infrastructure upgrade costs, is by using a cloud ERP, that would
potentially offer lower costs for organizations that want to engage in blockchain
accounting (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017).
Yu, Lin & Ting (2018) offer one of the more comprehensive papers that look at how
financial accounting would work under a new system like the blockchain, in both the
short and long run. In their paper, they come to a number of different conclusions. In
the short run, blockchain will be hampered with technical limitations, such as
scalability, because big firms generate a massive amount of information in a short
span of time and blockchain could have issues keeping up (Yu et al., 2018). They
also posit that accounting information would be available for anyone to download
and watch, which could scare away potential users. Add to this that the costs of
implementing a blockchain accounting solution might be expensive, as they might
have to potentially overhaul their entire accounting system (Yu et al., 2018).
However, there are still benefits in the short run, among them that blockchain is a
good solution for voluntary financial disclosure, to reduce information asymmetry
with their shareholders and investors (Yu et al., 2018). In the long run, the authors
believe that blockchain will have a very positive impact on financial accounting, as it
could reduce errors in disclosures, increase quality and even more mitigate the
information asymmetry (Yu et al., 2018). However, even with this change, people
can still abuse the system.

22

Although the five big accountancy firms are currently researching accounting
implementations on the blockchain, there have been very few academic studies into
the drawbacks and benefits of accounting on the blockchain (Carlin, 2018). There
are several suggestions on what it could entail, but these studies have not translated
into any physical implementations or case studies. However, there have been
significantly more studies into the auditing side of blockchain, which is what the next
chapter is about.

3.2. Auditing
Although accounting might be in turn for a paradigm shift, the auditing profession
might be even more challenged. There have been several exploratory studies into
how blockchain could potentially change the auditing profession, or whether auditors
are still needed to the same extent as before.
Rozario and Vasarhelyi (2018) discuss in their paper “Auditing with Smart Contracts”,
that blockchain could change the nature of auditing. The smart contracts on the
blockchain could potentially increase the audit quality and as well give the
information stakeholders want and require for making decisions. Auditors will need to
keep up with the technological advancements that are currently going on and be
proactive in helping shape the future of their profession (Deloitte, 2016). Some of the
Big 5 are already offering courses and education for their employees in blockchain
technology.
Kozlowski (2018) writes in his paper how auditing needs to adapt to the information
age, there needs to be a new framework that can be used for the blockchain. First, it
needs to be adaptive, where auditors are to put more focus on learning to
understand the smart controls and contracts and be able to read them and analyze
what the smart contracts are doing. They would be performing fraud detection, risk
assessment and systemic evaluations, a step up from record tracing and verification
(Kozlowski, 2018). Second, it needs to be scalable due to the different sizes of
blockchains and storage options, as well as potential use of big data at their clients.
Third, a distributed approach is needed, where auditors will be able to make
decisions and act independently in a local setting, without having to interact directly
with the client.

23

A caveat to triple-entry auditing is that all accounting must be performed on the
blockchain (Simoyama, Grigg, Bueno, & Oliveira, 2017). By having all the records on
the blockchain, it theoretically should be easier and faster for auditors to pull
information directly from the blockchains of the company, being audited (Dai &
Vasarhelyi, 2017). Records would not have to be pulled out of physical storage, and
instead auditors would look up what they need and want to investigate through
queries (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). Deloitte (2016) writes in their report, that
blockchain offers a great chance of making the job of auditors more efficient and
speedy. Instead of having to ask the company being audited to manually retrieve
documents, all information would be more accessible straight from the blockchain,
and time-consuming audit preparation work would be decreased for management
(Yu et al., 2018). Some authors have suggested this will change how auditors
conduct their work, where instead of focusing on testing samples they can now focus
more on verifying that internal controls are effective (Yu et al., 2018).
As information is stored on the blockchain, meaning a decrease in audit preparation,
near real-time audit work could be possible for routine items and freeing the auditor
to focus on more complex transactions (Deloitte, 2016). They also posit that with the
digitalization of their work, the auditor’s workload could be automated, together with
machine learning and analytics and suspicious transactions could be reported in
real-time (Deloitte, 2016). If support documents could be uploaded and encrypted
and linked to a blockchain and its entries, it could speed up the speed of financial
reporting and auditing (Deloitte, 2016).
The future auditor might need to be able to read and understand code to be able to
audit smart contracts, or perhaps this will give room for an entirely new branch in
auditing (Deloitte, 2016). According to Deloitte, CPAs will provide assurance to the
users of the technology, thanks to their independence, objectivity and expertise
(Deloitte, 2016). As previously mentioned, auditors might have to become more
versed in different coding languages to provide assurance services to interested
parties. Auditors might also work as oracle auditors, who evaluate the connections of
the blockchain and smart contracts, outside of the company. Looking for
vulnerabilities, errors and malicious intent would be the most important part of these
auditors (Deloitte, 2016). In the future, auditors might even work as “service auditors”
for consortium blockchains, where they verify applications and smart contracts

24

before they are uploaded onto the network. Administration positions might also be
given to CPAs, as they are independent and unbiased on the network (Deloitte,
2016). As administrators they would be tasked with vetting and checking who is
allowed onto a permissioned blockchain.
Although there is much discussion on how the implementation of blockchain would
change the work of the auditor and how it could make the job easier, most viewers
agree that the auditor will be as relevant as it is now. Auditors will still have to apply
their professional judgement to these cases and analyze how management has
prepared their financial statements (Deloitte, 2016). However, Deloitte also believes
that the changes are not imminent, and it will take time for them to come into effect.
As mentioned earlier, one of the most discussed features enabled by blockchains
would be the possibility of real time accounting and auditing by smart contracts, and
how that might change the current accounting paradigm. How these smart contracts
would fit into accounting and auditing will be explained in the next chapter.

3.3. Smart Contracts
Smart contracts features have already been implemented into some blockchains, the
most notable example being Ethereum, which allows users to create their own smart
contracts and deploy them onto the network (Buterin, 2013). These smart contracts
are powered by the Ethereum currency, but can also remit their own tokens for
various purposes (fuel for the network, tokenization of assets and more) (Buterin,
2013). One example is the earlier mentioned Request Network, which has created a
smart contract on the Ethereum network that has the purpose of serving as a base
for decentralized applications (DApps), such as their own in-the-works triple entry
accounting application (Request Network, 2018).
Although the name “smart contract” would imply that it is a form of contract is
capable of being smart, it is not. A smart contract is a computer program that can
autonomously approve or perform actions, provided that conditions have been met
(Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018). A good example of a smart contract in an accounting
setting is that of receiving of inventory and payment of those.
The smart contract in question would include several parts, first when the purchased
inventory is received, an employee verifies and scans the bill of ladle. The smart
contract reads this information, and if the ordered inventory is accounted for, it will

25

then release the payment automatically. In the case that the received inventory does
not meet the ordered inventory, it does not release the payment (Rozario &
Vasarhelyi, 2018). This would relegate the accountant to a supervisor position who
monitors payments authorized by the smart contract. Combine this with accounting
on the blockchain, there is a clear and immutable record that can be followed from
start to the end. It has also been suggested that IoT (Internet of Things) could be
incorporated with smart contracts, to for example, allow the smart contract to
understand how Incoterms works (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017).
Deloitte (2016) provides a good example of how a smart contract could help in a
derivative contract in hedging the price of oil. When an agreement has been made
by two parties and they have signed a contract, it is added to the blockchain. The
funds are then held in an escrow on the blockchain till when the contract is
terminated. When the contract is terminated, it registers the price of the oil from an
oracle, a trusted source pre-defined in the contract, and pays out to the party, who
has won the bid. (Deloitte, 2016)
Potential suggestions for accounting with smart contracts are observing covenant
bonds, where the real time accounting is keeping track that the terms that were set
are fulfilled (Kiviat, 2015).
One of the most interesting propositions when it comes to blockchain and smart
contracts, is the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, known as
DAOs. These are organizations entirely governed by smart contracts (Dai &
Vasarhelyi, 2017). These organizations function solely on smart contracts and have
minimal human interaction. When a condition is fulfilled, it moves on to the next one.
The most famous example is the Ethereum DAO, which had the purpose of
dispensing Ethereum to projects. Benefits of organizations like these, are said to be
the complete transparency and auditable trail of actions.

3.3.1. Automatic Real Time Accounting
In theory, blockchain and smart contracts could bring us to almost full-fledged
automatic and real time accounting (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). By allowing smart
contracts that can automate large parts of accounting, coupled together with
blockchain that offers an immutable ledger with high traceability, authors have
suggested that this could be the end of financial statements (Dai & Vasarhelyi,

26

2017). Some experts have even gone as far as suggesting, that companies could
open their accounting to interested third parties, such as stakeholders and auditors,
and allow them to monitor in real time what the situation is, with the assistance of
smart contracts (Dai & Vasarhelyi, 2017). This, however, is seen by many as a step
that will take time to happen, because companies might not be willing to disclose
everything so openly (Carlin, 2018).
Auditing could also be greatly assisted by smart contracts. In the study, “Auditing
with smart contracts”, Rozario and Vasarhelyi (2018) contend that smart contracts
would make the work for auditors more streamlined. Instead of actively participating
in analytics and internal control tests, they could instead have smart contracts that
independently and autonomously execute these actions on behalf of the auditor
(Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018). This would give time and opportunity for the auditor to
engage in other value building actions. By allowing a smart contract to take care of
the audit, that independently and autonomously analyzes accounting records and
other relevant information, it is believed it would be superior to the traditional audit
procedure where the auditor manually selects a sample of sales contracts and likes
and then by hand examines them. The same is true for smart internal control tests
(Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018).
Kokina et al. (2017) suggests in their article that smart contracts might ease the
workload of auditors significantly, by allowing automated audits processes and make
it easier to track ownerships of assets by tailoring contracts. This is what could be
one of the driving forces for both the accounting and auditing profession, “embedding
smart contracts and machine learning capabilities into blockchain-based recordkeeping systems.”, which will take care of manual and repetitive tasks (Carlin, 2018).
These technological advances could greatly help push down costs for maintenance
of financial records, as well as increase reliability.

3.4. Limitations and Drawbacks
However, not all agree that blockchain is suitable for the accounting environment.
These exploratory studies try to show why blockchain is inherently incompatible with
accounting. One of these studies is made by Coyne & McMickle (2017) who argue

27

that blockchain could weaken the security instead of strengthening it. One of these
would be confidentiality.
In their study Coyne & McMickle (2017) are concerned that the confidentiality of
blockchains are compromised when applied to accounting. On a public blockchain,
all accounting information would be publicly available for everyone to see, download
and edit (Coyne & McMickle, 2017). Trade secrets and other sensitive information
could be leaked, creating a vulnerable environment. The authors posit that
companies most likely would not be interested in having or participating in public
blockchains, since they already do not want to disclose information without the
explicit need for it. This raises the question whether private blockchains could be
used for accounting information, since companies are privy to sharing it. This would
however create problems, as the participants on the network would be very few, the
auditor and company itself, which in turn leads to issues in the security of
information. But in the end, the authors are not quite particularly worried about
confidentiality or privacy, as the technology is constantly developing and there are
already some proofs of concept on privacy and masking transactions on public
blockchains.
A more pressing concern is the possibility of a 51 percent attack (Coyne & McMickle,
2017). As mentioned before in chapter 2.3.1, a 51 percent attack is when a party
controls over 51 percent of the hash rate of the entire network. By controlling 51
percent, it is possible to start changing what was supposed to be immutable. For
accounting to work on the blockchain, a company needs to be able to make sure that
no-one can control over 51 percent of the network in order to manipulate the
information on the blockchain (Coyne & McMickle, 2017). This is true for both private
and public blockchains, with the public blockchain allowing anyone outside the
company to potentially gaining control and the private blockchain allowing anyone
inside the company to gain control. Even in a private configuration, where there is an
auditor and company, the auditor might have 50 percent control over the network.
The final weakness that Coyne & McMickle (2017) mention in their paper is the
incomplete transaction verification. This means that companies running these
blockchains cannot verify that the transactions on the network are valid. In other
words, the blockchain cannot give absolute certainty to whether something

28

happened in the real life, and therefore there needs to be more evidence that a
transaction indeed has happened. If this is not solved, it means that fake invoices
and transactions can be input into the system to inflate numbers and mislead
investors and employees. Deloitte (2016) has also stated that auditors most likely will
not be able to gain enough audit evidence from solely viewing blockchain
transactions, which is something O’Leary (2017) also agrees with. Deloitte (2016)
uses the purchase of a product paid for with bitcoin as an example scenario. In this
scenario, the fact that a transaction happened is recorded on the blockchain, but an
auditor would not be able to determine whether the product was delivered to the
recipient, or whether the transaction was legitimate. Therefore, Deloitte (2016) wants
to emphasize that transactions occurring on a blockchain can be:
-

Unauthorized, fraudulent or illegal

-

Executed between related parties

-

Linked to a side agreement that is “off-chain”

-

Incorrectly classified in the financial statements.

In other words, one cannot blindly trust what is on the blockchain, which goes
against the moniker “trustless”.
Rückeshäuser (2017) thinks that the blockchain is particularly ill-suited for preventing
fraud at companies, due to the risk of 51 percent attacks. According to her, by giving
malicious managers access to such a system, they could cover their tracks and
manipulate the data according to their own will. Rückeshäuser (2017) says this could
lead to situations where companies are subject to, but completely unaware of large
fraudulent actions committed by one or several people, that is theoretically
untraceable. Rückeshäuser (2017) does admit that this could be mitigated with a
permissioned blockchain, but still believes that there is an inherent danger to it.
Another drawback of this technology is the cost of implementing it. As this is an
entirely new and untested technology, those that want to try it might have to change
the hardware and related underlying technologies several times. The investments
can be huge and costly. If the blockchain were to be a PoW network, the electricity
costs could outweigh the benefits of running everything on the blockchain, as it is
resource intensive and power consuming (Coyne & McMickle, 2017). A system with
PoS could potentially work better, as it is less resource intensive, but there are few

29

existing systems that are decentralized enough to avoid a potential 51 percent attack
scenario.
People also believe that blockchain will solve all problems, but it in fact will not solve
all issues. A blockchain will not prevent misappropriation, as it only is a tool to
convey information. Correcting potential accounting mistakes might become harder
to accomplish, as the information is now immutable. On the other hand, it also can
lead to creating a false sense of security among people relying on the accounting
information from the blockchain.
Although not a direct drawback or limitation, the interest in researching accounting
functions on the blockchain has remained very lackluster, even though there have
been promises that the technology will provide major improvements over the current
double-entry accounting system. According to Carlin (2018) this would be the perfect
time for accountants to help shape the future of their profession, be it in regulation or
practical application. Furthermore, Carlin believes that triple-entry accounting on the
blockchain has potential to change the industry, but the window of opportunity to
influence the future is now (2018). If we do not seize the opportunity to create a
standardized solution for accounting and auditing on the blockchain when the
technology is still being researched and developed, it will lead to a fractured
approach in the future, in addition to a lack in regulation (Carlin, 2018).
Blockchain is still an untested technology in the accounting field. As of right now,
there are no studies on whether blockchain will save money or if it will be costlier to
operate. These are all facts that make it hard to determine at this point if it is a good
investment from an economical point of view or not.

4. Methodology
This chapter is dedicated to presenting the methodology, hypothesis and approach.
In this chapter the foundation for answering the question asked by this master’s
thesis, “what are the Finnish auditors’ receptibility to blockchain in the
accounting/auditing industry”, will be detailed. Since this a new field of research,
there is not much quantitative data available, which in turn indicates that this thesis
must be a qualitative study. No prior studies have been done in Finland, asking
auditors on their thoughts on blockchain.

4.1. Qualitative
To be able to assess whether the qualitative research has a high enough quality, we
need to measure the reliability and validity of the study. Reliability can be divided into
two parts: external reliability and internal reliability. External reliability is a
measurement on how well a study can be replicated. However, this is difficult to
measure in qualitative studies, as social settings cannot be frozen and are always
evolving (Bryman 2015). This is also applicable to when researching something that
is currently developing or emerging. As time goes on, opinions and thoughts will
develop over time, as Lampard and Pole (2015) put it; “the data yielded are a
reflection of the circumstances under which the interview is conducted.” We also
arrive at another issue when discussing internal reliability, which requires there to be
more than one observer or member in a team that agree on what they see and hear
(Bryman 2015), however this is of course becomes problematic when only one
person is conducting an interview. According to Bryman, this can be addressed by
displaying the research process, choice of theory, field notes and so on, to allow
others to reproduce the research as close as the original as possible.
Validity refers to “you are observing, identifying, or “measuring” what you are
seeing”. Just as with reliability, this can be divided into internal and external validity.
Internal validity refers to the idea that there is a good connection between the
observations of the researcher and the theoretical ideas. According to Bryman
(2015), this is the “strength” of qualitative studies, since it gives a much closer
understand and viewpoint of the subject that is being currently studied. External
validity is, however, an issue for qualitative research, as it refers to “which degree
the findings can be generalized across a social setting.”. This is usually a lot harder

31

in qualitative studies due to the small sample sizes used in these studies, either in
ethnographic or case studies.

4.2. Hypothesis
The purpose of this study is to measure the receptibility of auditors in Finland,
relating to blockchain. This is one of the first if not the first ever studies in Finland
that has been done to gauge the interests and receptibility of auditors, in relation to
blockchain technology in the context of accounting and auditing. Therefore, this will
be an exploratory study.
Based on previous studies done abroad on the perceived impact of blockchain in the
accounting and auditing industry, most authors believe there will be some form of
change from blockchain. There are therefore two different hypotheses’ concerning
the auditors receptibility of blockchain:
H1 Auditors expect that the promise and underlying technology of blockchain
and distributed ledger technology will change how accounting works.
H2 Auditors expect that the promise and underlying technology of blockchain
and distributed ledger technology will change how auditors will conduct their
work in the future.
In other countries, auditors are already receiving training in what blockchain is and
how it functions, it would not be surprising to see this phenomenon eventually in
Finland as well. Therefore, auditors might already have a certain expectation on
what blockchain could mean for the accounting industry and the auditors’ work. It is
not completely unwarranted to believe that the auditors believe there will be some
form of change to the industry, based on the research that has been done by
academics.
There are several forms of qualitative approaches we can take, but for this research,
the best approach for a qualitative study is to conduct interviews with auditors. The
idea is to use the results of the interviews, which are non-structured, to gain a better
understanding of what participants know about blockchain technology and its relation
to the accounting and auditing industry (Walle, 2015). The next part will explain the
data and sources, as well as how the interviews will be conducted. Later,
interviewing will be explained as well.

32

4.3. Data and Sources
In other countries, the Big 5 (KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, BDO and EY) are researching
future applications of both accounting and auditing on the blockchain, which is one of
the reasons why the Big 5 also would be the main group of interest in this research.
The best approach to get reliable data is to use a homogenous population (Walle,
2015).
One of the issues, when researching new phenomenon’s or technologies, is the lack
of awareness. People are most likely very aware of Bitcoin, but are they aware of the
underlying technology? Do they understand it? Therefore, it might be a good idea to
include an explanation on what blockchain is, if a person has answered that they are
not aware of what it entails. This, however, does bring up the potential danger of
contaminating the people participating in the survey (Walle, 2015).
The alternative is to provide examples of different scenarios and explanations on
what is being asked, however the issue here is that the questions might be incur a
bias in the respondents (Walle, 2015)
Another question is whether the questions should be limited to simple scales from
one to five, or if we want respondents to respond to the question with their own
answers. The benefit of having a simple scale is that the information is much easier
to quantify, as there are preselected categories (Walle, 2015). However, if we let the
respondents respond with their own answers, there is a potential of receiving more
in-depth answers to the questions that are being asked (Walle, 2015). This does lead
to a potential issue where it might be harder to quantify the data, but the method
suits much better to what this study is trying to accomplish.
To acquire the best information possible, both current and former auditors will be
asked to participate. Only auditors with two or more years of experience will be
considered for interviews. We want the auditors interviewed to have some form of
working experience of the industry. As for former auditors, we want them to have
been out of the job for less than five years. By having older and more experienced
auditors in our data samples, even those who have quit the job or that are retired, we
will gain insights from those where the industry has been heading and who have a
more intricate understanding of how the auditing and accounting industry works.

33

Through a combination of auditors with different amounts of work experience we
have a better understanding of what auditors think of blockchain in an accounting
and auditing environment. The young auditors might be more open to new
technologies, whilst auditors in the middle of their career understand what the
current trend is. The former auditors, especially recently retired, have a deep
knowledge and understanding of the auditing industry are likely able to see whether
the industry would want to use a technology like blockchain.

4.4. Interviews
Interviews always consist of two parties: The informant and the investigator (Walle,
2015). The informer is the one providing answers to the investigators questions and
depending on what kind of an interview it is, will respond to the questions in a
predetermined way (Walle, 2015).
For the interviews to be effective, the informant needs to be somewhat familiar with
the interview area (Walle, 2015). In this case the area would revolve around
blockchain, accounting and auditing. As a graduate in accounting the interviewer has
experience in the area that will be interviewed in, but there are no guarantees that
the persons selected will have any experience in the blockchain area I want to
interview them about. Therefore, information needs to be supplied to the interview
candidates either before or at the start of the interview, or I must forego all auditors,
who have no experience of blockchain technology, and try to find only those who
have some experience.
Deciding to exclude or include those who have no experience comes with certain
challenges, benefits, and drawbacks. The first major challenge would be finding
enough people who have experience or a good understanding of what blockchain is,
and how it could be used in an accounting and auditing setting. Finland is a small
country, but we have highly educated auditors. However, since blockchain is a new
technology, the number of people familiar with the technology might be rather low.
This is the reason that auditors who have no have little to no experience about
blockchain have been included, there might simply not be enough auditors who are
knowledgeable in this area, and as this is a study to measure receptibility and
thoughts on this subject, even those who are not experts should be considered.

34

One of the benefits of including people with little to no experience is also receiving
ideas and viewpoints from people who are not as well versed in the subject. It is a
double-edged sword, as they might provide insight that is very pertinent to the thesis,
but on the other hand they might not be able to give any data that can be used for
this research.
In this case, participants both without and with forehand knowledge of blockchain
could participate. This answers one of the research questions, whether auditors
know about blockchain technology. The answer to this was collected when asking
the auditors whether they wanted to participate in an interview about on accounting
and auditing with blockchain. They were also asked if they are aware of what it is.
Those that wanted to participate were sent a short primer on what blockchain
technology is. This guide was sent to all participants, no matter if they had answered
if they knew what blockchain is or not. The guide has been provided as an appendix
(appendix B). Walle (2015) provides in his book a good guide on how to structure an
interview to have it be efficient. The first step is to establish goals of research, which
we already have. We want to know what auditors know about blockchain and if they
believe accounting will benefit from it.

Figure 5 Walle

35

The second step is to make sure that the material understood well enough by the
person conducting the interview, so that they can ask questions that relate to the
area they want to research.
The third step is preparing the questions once the purpose of the interview is
understood. Depending on the structure of the interview, the questions change.
The fourth step is related to organizing how the questions are asked. The most
important questions should be asked first, and questions that are not as relevant as
last
At this point, it should be clear whether it will be an unstructured or a structured
interview. This thesis will rely on a semi-structured interview with pre-established
questions, that are open-ended, allowing for the informants to speak their mind and
give their honest opinion on the topic at hand (Walle, 2015). In this case a semistructured interview is better, since it gives the interview a structure to follow for both
the investigator and informant. But the semi-structured interview also allows the
investigator to ask questions outside of the interview guide, which gives more
flexibility and can lead to interesting discoveries, even though one is still following
the same general thread as the other interviews (Bryman & Bell, 2015). If possible,
these interviews would be face-to-face, but phone calls and skype are also
alternatives as it depends on what the informant can do.
For this interview, people with and without working experience of blockchain have
been interviewed. This is a new field and there have been very few projects
developed in blockchain at Big 5 companies. Therefore, participants without
experience are a valuable resource to understand the implications of blockchain.

4.4.2. Interview Guide
Before conducting interviews, an interview guide needs to be developed. The
interview guide gives direction to the interview and allows the interviewer to focus on
asking the correct questions from the subject. To develop the questions that were to
be asked of the subjects, previous studies needed to be analysed and let them
influence the most important questions related to the main purpose of the thesis
(Walle, 2015).

36

In the case of this thesis, there are not many articles written on the auditors’
perceptions on blockchain in an accounting and auditing environment, and there is
none in Finland so far. This is not a bad case, as this allows us to perform research
about something almost completely new, and from a Finnish perspective. This in its
turn means we must develop the questions from a blank slate and extract the most
important parts about blockchain and those that might interest auditors.
To make sure the interviews are as fluent as possible, we want to group these
interviews into different categories. This should allow the conversation to flow
unimpededly, combined with the interview being designed to be a semi-structured
interview. Although the interview guide should, indeed, be a guide for the interview,
the open nature of a semi-structured interview allows the interview to explore areas
that would not be discussed when only utilizing structured interview and this might
lead to new areas that should be studied further (Walle, 2015). However, this can
cause issues if the interview does not control the discussion, as it might generate
information that is unnecessary and causes extra work when coding and analysing
the information.
After the interview guide is developed, it is important to test it and further refine it,
and hence a pre-check was conducted. This pre-check interview was used to
change and adjust some questions, as well as improve the quality of the questions.
The pre-check interview was not included as an interview, as the interview questions
were changed enough for the answers to no longer be relevant for this thesis.

4.5. Conducting Interviews
For this interview, nine people with different levels of experience from financial
auditing were interviewed. These auditors were contacted through several means,
some were personal connections, others were reached through the help of other
participants and some were contacted on social media and asked if they wanted to
participate.
In this case, since we wanted to see the receptibility of auditors on blockchain in
Finland, and their knowledge, searching information from both those who have heard
about it and not heard about it, there was not a strict criterion on prior knowledge. An
introductory letter was sent to all participants detailing the purpose of the interviews

37

and giving a short explanation on what blockchain is. As mentioned earlier, this letter
is appendix B in this thesis.

4.6. Data Saturation and Analysis
When it comes to qualitative studies, especially interviews, it is usually not as
straightforward to find the number of people that should be interviewed. The most
common and simple method of finding the right number of participants is to first
agree on a number that one thinks would be enough for the interviews, the sample
size. Then one needs to look out for “saturation point” (Saunders et al., 2018). This is
a crucial point, as this is the point that determines when enough interviews have
been carried out. The saturation point, in its simplicity, means that a suitable amount
of people has been interviewed so that conclusions can be drawn from the data
available and that no new information can be expected from consequent interviews
(Saunders et al., 2018). It is not recommended to interview one or two people and
say that the saturation point has been reached, as that does risk the pool being too
small, and will skew the results massively.
The point of interviewing people up to the saturation point and not beyond, is that no
new additional information will be supplied to the research, and the more interviews
will only be additional work, for no real pay-off, Fusch (2015) calls this “depth in
data”. Data collection for qualitative studies is not about the numbers of participants,
but about the amount of information collected from the participants. One should aim
for a combination of so called “thick” and “rich data” (Fusch, 2015). This means that
you preferably want “thick, as in “a lot of data” and “rich data” which is nuanced,
intricate and more. This allows for a better and easier analysis of the material. In the
case of this thesis, a lower number of interviewees was also wanted, as the
questions were open ended and meant to spark a conversation. The saturation point
was reached quickly, as the knowledge of this area is still quite limited in Finland.
Saturation point analysis with a small sample size is not as statistically rigid as
ANOVA, nor does it allow us to draw any definitive conclusions on what has been
uncovered. This is a compromise that must be considered when conducting an
exploratory study on a new topic, as the sample sizes can be expected to be small
due to the lack of available expertise or material in Finland.

38

The interviews will be transcribed making the answers provided by the auditors
accessible for easier analysis and readability when analyzing the data. Once the
interviews have been transcribed, a simple matrix of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ responses can be
created, which allows for a quick analysis of what auditors think of each question.

39

5. Discussion on Findings
In total nine auditors were willing to participate in the interviews revolving around
blockchain, accounting and auditing. Although the sample size is small, it does allow
us to draw conclusions on what is the purpose of this thesis: what is the receptibility
of auditors in Finland related to blockchain, and what they think of the technology. As
stated in the methodology chapter 4: when conducting research where interviews are
the main method of discovery, the number of interviewees is not set in stone, and
instead focus should be on finding a pattern from the responses (Saunders et al.,
2018). In this case, interviewing the nine people that were willing to participate has
resulted in enough material to identify trends and visions of what auditors think of
blockchain, and how they see it impacting the accounting and auditing industry in the
future.
All the interviewed were from the Big 5 accounting companies, some were recently
retired, but most of them were still in the workforce. A breakdown is provided below.
The auditors taking part in the interviews have been given pseudonyms for
anonymity, and gender has also been swapped on some of the participants.

The participants who agreed to be interviewed varied greatly in years working with
auditing. The subjects were chosen through purposive sampling. The goal of
purposive sampling is to find subjects with rich stories that are required for the study.

40

Some of the auditors had also pivoted towards IT-auditing after working with financial
auditing for a while. One auditor had not worked directly as a financial auditor but
supported them and had worked his entire career as an IT-auditor. The reason for
the inclusion of this auditor, was simply because blockchain is at this point mostly a
technical solution. Therefore, it was important to hear the thoughts of an IT-auditor,
on this technology and how it could function in an audit environment.
The interviews were conducted in several different ways. Five were interviewed at
their offices, three were interviewed over phone or skype and the last one was
interviewed at a coffeeshop.

5.1. Interview Questions and Answers
As mentioned in the methodology chapter, the respondents were selected based on
different categories of years of work experience. The purpose of this was to find
participants who can provide different opinions, influenced by their years working,
but still working in the same industry. People who have been working for longer
periods as auditors have seen more changes come and go to their work and are
important in analyzing whether blockchain has the potential to introduce something
new and useful for both accounting and auditing. However, interviewing auditors who
have been working from two years up to ten, is also an important demographic
element in the study. These auditors are the future of the field and are the ones who
might be working with this kind of technology. Therefore, it is of paramount
importance why they needed to be interviewed. Same goes for the participants with
over ten to twenty years of experience, these are the future managers (if not already
managers) and some of them will be participating in and driving changes at the Big 5
accounting companies.
Below is an analysis of each of the question directed to the auditors with some of the
comments they added after they were probed.

41

5.2. Analysis of Questions
The questions presented here were created with the expressed purpose of
measuring the auditors receptibility on blockchain, and other thoughts. These
questions vary from the very basic fundamentals offered by blockchains, on whether
the immutability of blockchains can increase trust or reliability of accounting records.
Some of the questions try to measure whether smart contracts are something
auditors believe they would have use of, and another asks whether auditors expect
that their jobs would change if blockchain technology would be implemented by their
customers and into their own jobs were also asked. Each question below has an
explanation as to why they were asked. An appendix (A) with the questions has been
attached.

Question 1. Have you heard about blockchain before this interview?
This question was devised to measure whether Finnish auditors had heard about
blockchain before this interview. If they had heard, they were further probed on, in
what context they had heard of it.
Out of all the participants in this interview, six out of nine auditors had heard about
blockchain in one form or another. Johanna, Thor, Johan, Per, Stefan and Carl were
the ones that had knowledge before they were sent the explanatory letter introducing
this interview and what blockchain is.
With further probing, it was discovered that Thor, Johan, Per, Stefan and Carl had all
gained knowledge about blockchain technology through discussions with colleagues
on virtual currencies, meanwhile Johanna had heard about it being discussed at
client companies. Both Johan and Per had further read about the subject; Johan
attended lectures on the subject, whilst Per read studies done by the company that
he works at.

42

Question 2. Has your company or colleagues expressed interest in
blockchain?
This question was asked to measure the general knowledge among coworkers and
at the workplace on blockchain technology. By analyzing this question, it is easier to
understand what kind of an interest there is among the accounting companies, and if
they think that the technology could be beneficial for them or their clients. The
weakness in this question, is that it does not measure actual development, and it
also does not consider what the IT department might be working on without the
auditors’ knowledge, that might be related to accounting and auditing on the
blockchain. Another issue is that auditors do not necessarily talk about technical
solutions to auditing, and instead discuss more general work-related matters.
Nonetheless, discussions with colleagues can grant us a good understanding on
what the current sentiment at the company is and they give us the chance to further
extrapolate on what the current thoughts are in the industry.
Only three out of the nine interviewed said that they had heard their colleagues
talking about the technology. Johanna mentioned that in her case, it had been the
consultants who had expressed interest in the technology. Johan, on the other hand,
who has closer contacts with the IT department, mentioned that they had discussed
with colleagues what kind of an impact blockchain could potentially have on both
accounting and auditing. They also mentioned that most likely every single Big 5 is
taking notice of blockchain and trying to evaluate what the impacts of this might be
for the future of auditing and accounting.
Carl, who works as an IT auditor, and has been working closely with auditors through
his entire career, mentioned that in their team they have been discussing blockchain
on a technical level and potential future use-cases for the technology. Johan
mentioned that in their case, they had been discussing the valuation of
cryptocurrencies, not the application cases of the blockchain technology.
The responses to this question are unsurprising since the technology is still very
nascent, but there has still been discussion about blockchain technology. The most
important takeaway and conclusion from the responses, is that from those working
with auditing related matters, have not seen an interest from their workplaces of
implementing it to accounting or auditing.

43

Question 3. Will immutability increase reliability of accounting information?
The immutability provided by blockchain is one of the most important aspects of the
technology. By asking auditors their opinions on whether the accounting entries
would be more reliable and accurate in practical life, we should be able to gauge
how important they believe this feature is and whether it is something that they would
value having in their line of work.
When asked about immutability provided by blockchain, there was a split on whether
it would in fact improve reliability of information. Johanna, Stefan, Stella and Carl
thought reliability would benefit from immutability provided by the blockchain, by for
example, having machines automatically enter information could potentially be more
reliable than having a human enter the information. They did however admit that a
human would be needed to supervise it in some way to prevent egregious mistakes
from happening. Stella mentioned that “one of the purposes of auditors is to verify
the reliability of data, and make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.” She then
mentioned that being able to have the power to make sure information is reliable
without having to separately vet it, would decrease the auditors’ workload. Johanna
mentioned that immutability would, in her opinion, increase the reliability and would
require less manual checking.
Martin, Peter, Thor, Johan and Per expressed another opinion. Although they saw
benefits of having information digitized, easily accessible and immutable, it would not
make information inherently more reliable. There could still be issues when entering
the information, i.e. entering wrong information, entering fraudulent information or not
entering certain information. The reliability of information is based on the data that is
entered, and the people entering it. Therefore, it would not be inherently more
reliable. With the information being immutable, it would be much harder to change
the information afterwards in case it was wrong. Having information on the
blockchain does not mean that the information is more reliable, some of the
respondents had added.
The ones for and the ones against both raise important points, and the participants
arguing against it increasing reliability, are correct in their viewpoint that the weak
point of course is the stage where information is entered. Peter put it quite succinctly,
“nothing is bulletproof and completely secure.”

44

Question 4. Will immutability increase trust of accounting information?
This question was asked because one of the aspects of blockchain is its
“trustlessness” which should increase the trustworthiness of the information that
exists on the blockchain, by not requiring any central authority to preside over the
data. In the context of accounting and auditing, the immutability of information
existing on a blockchain could technically increase the trustworthiness of the
accounting process.
Most of the interviewees did believe that the immutability could increase the trust of
accounting information. In their answers to this question, everyone except Martin and
Per agreed that trust could increase due to the immutable aspect. When probing the
auditors that thought that immutability would increase trust, they said that having the
information locked down and immutable after being entered, would help them know
that the information cannot have been tampered with after the fact. This does not of
course exclude fraud, as some of the interviewees said, since the bookings still need
to be verified to have been done correctly.
Carl, Johan and Per, who had read about blockchain more extensively, mentioned
that since information could be changed later by adding or subtracting wanted sums,
it would still be quite safe from manipulation and trust of the information would be
high. They based their view on the fact that there would always be an untamperable
chain of events. The issue of entering false information persists, they said, but the
fact that the entire system is based on being “trustless” would hopefully mitigate this
issue.

Question 5. Would corporations prefer private or public blockchains?
The purpose of this question is to understand whether corporations would prefer a
private or public blockchain from the perspective of an auditor. Auditors are in the
position to give their opinion on whether their clients would prefer to use a private or
public blockchain if they were to use blockchain for their accounting. This is a
question that goes into the heart of what a blockchain is, should it be a private or a
public blockchain, since it dictates how safe it is and who has access to it.

45

As can be seen in the results, every single auditor said that private blockchains
would be the most preferable alternative. When probed about this, the answers they
gave were straightforward. There is a lot of sensitive financial information being
passed around, and if a blockchain would be public, this information would be open
for everyone to see. Although this information is obfuscated with random hashes, the
accounts that money would go into would still be open for everyone to see. Peter,
Carl and Johan mentioned that some of the accounting information could be put on a
public blockchain for investors to access and use when evaluating companies. Peter
also added that this could also be compromise for when authorities need to look for
information, as they would just need to look for the information they need and when
they need, instead of having the accounting department conjure up the information
for a specific request.
Johan mentioned that consortium blockchains would most likely be the perfect
middle-path for companies, as they would be on large network which would mean
less chance of tampering and there would be less maintenance costs due to,
hopefully, a third-party taking care of the network. However, companies might still be
worried that the sensitive information could be seen by competitors and they would
not be in control of everything. Hence, Johan also suggested that companies most
likely would start off with private blockchains and could potentially move to
something akin to a consortium blockchain in the future.
Expectedly, private blockchains are what all respondents suggested that companies
will be using. This makes sense, since private blockchains are as their name
suggests, private. However, the usage of private blockchains can defeat the purpose
of blockchains, as they are usually owned by one party. Encryption could be a future
solution for keeping information safe on public blockchains, and there are some in
the works for the Ethereum blockchain.

Question 6. Would information in real-time would be useful for auditors?
This question has the purpose of establishing whether the real-time nature of
blockchains would be of any use for auditors. This is one of the fundamental benefits
of blockchain since information can be appended to a blockchain instantaneously.
This in turn can create a real-time stream of accounting information. Considering

46

this, auditors might be able to follow up accounting information in real time and take
snapshots of the current situation of a client.
Most of the auditors thought that this information processing would bring some form
of benefit to both reporting from companies and it would also help when auditing.
When probing further into why they thought this solution would help with auditing and
reporting, Johanna, Johan, Stella and Carl said that it would change the way we
need to think of auditing. Not having to wait for information to be updated and
bookings to be made, would make information be available instantly. This would
slightly change the role of the auditor from looking into the past and looking at the
present instead. However, the auditors who reflected this opinion still said that
auditing will remain mostly focused on looking at the past, since it gives a more
complete picture. Realtime auditing might speed up the process of consolidating
information, which in turn would speed up auditing.
Martin and Peter, who did not think real-time information would help, simply said that
auditing looks at the past and will remain like that. They did not see any additional
benefits from having access to real-time information. If someone were to try and
utilize it for auditing purposes, as in real-time auditing, there would be too much
information to filter and process to be useful.

Question 7. Can digitized/distributed information from the blockchain ease
auditing work?
Information on the blockchain is always digitized and available in a distributed
manner. In the case of a blockchain, in case one source fails, the same exact
information is available from other nodes on the blockchain. As mentioned earlier
this feature is what sets blockchain apart from other forms of digital storage that
function with one centralized operator.
When asking the auditors on whether they believe that digitized information on the
blockchain would be to any benefit in auditing, every single person said yes, that it
would.
When probing them on why they thought that auditing could benefit from this, Martin,
Johanna, Thor Stefan, Stella and Carl stated that digital and digitized information is

47

already part of their job and they extensively use it when the time comes to conduct
auditing. For example, receipts and other documents that are used in auditing come
both in digital and physical form. The digital format was preferred by the auditors as
it made their job faster and easier, without having any need to have someone from
the client fetch the material from storage, when conducting audit work. With their
understanding of blockchain, they liked the idea of having all the information on the
chain, always accessible. Johanna and Johan mentioned that it would be convenient
to have the information available at their workplace through some form of connection
to the clients blockchain. A lot of the auditing work could be conducted at the office
instead of travelling to the clients. Johanna also mentioned that this would also
decrease the preparatory work done before the audit, as auditors could check
transactions and receipts and records with the corresponding hashes, and this
coincides with what some of the previous studies state. Johanna and Johan said that
with some clients, they already have access to digital records straight from their
workplace, but they are still quite rare.

Question 8. Are accounting smart contracts a good idea?
With smart contracts being an increasingly important part of blockchains, the
auditor’s opinions on these are important to measure, as they are the part of the
blockchain that can help auditors to complete audits both faster and more efficiently.
This is also true for accounting departments that could see a potential boon from an
automated system akin to smart contracts.
When asked about smart contracts in the case of accounting and if they would assist
their clients with accounting, most auditors were in favor it. In general, automation is
something that the clients are already striving to use, but it is still some ways off.
Some of their clients use very rudimentary automated systems, for example booking
products coming into warehouses and adding these to the balance sheet. However,
the payments still need to be done by a human. Automating accounting with simple
smart contracts could potentially allow for faster accounting at finance departments.
Peter stated that simple transactions could easily be handled by smart contracts, and
possibly even be of assistance in complex transactions. Martin mentioned that

48

allowing accounting smart contracts could assist in reducing cost and overhead in
the accounting departments.
The danger is to rely too much on automation, according to a couple of auditors.
Automation is a nice “cushion”, as Peter stated, that allows people to focus on more
complex bookings, however, it can also mean that people no longer critically think of
simple transactions and let them run their own course. This has the potential for
abuse, and a safeguard should be to always require someone at least to monitor the
transactions in case there is something that raises suspicions. Another risk, asked as
a question by Martin, is what happens if an invoice is wrong and paid? Since it is on
the blockchain, it cannot be rolled back, it is a permanent addition to the network.
Stella wanted to emphasize that this new system would put a lot more responsibility
on accountants to check whether the information is correct and be constantly
vigilant, however the amount of human-made errors would decrease, if not almost
completely disappear.

Question 9. Are auditing smart contracts a good idea?
For auditors, auditing smart contracts on the blockchain have the potential to help
auditors to analyze the simplest transactions automatically, but more complex
transactions would still require auditors to either analyze them together with the
smart contracts, or to do it manually. These smart contracts, however, can be
tailored to suit their current client.
The auditors agreed that smart contracts would make life at least a bit easier. Having
small software programs that perform basic auditing when auditors are analyzing the
more complex transactions would decrease the workload. This would also potentially
be a cost savings move as well, since demanding fewer people to analyze
transactions, less people would be needed in general.
Stella and Martin mentioned that they did like the thought of being able to adapt a
smart contract depending on the job. Thor stated that time could be spent on value
building, customer relations and testing internal systems more efficiently and more
robustly, with smart contracts taking care of the simple transactions. Johanna
suggested using smart to solely focus on more complex transactions and Carl

49

suggested that smart contracts could be used to verify receipts and other
documents.
Although there is already some form of automation employed in some audit tasks,
smart contracts would take it a step further, streamlining basic processes. However,
this would not make auditors obsolete, as they are still needed for evaluating the
more intricate and complex transactions that a computer system would not be able
analyze. These would be for example, anything with any component of valuation. Not
all tasks can be automated as said by Stefan.

Question 10. If blockchain were to be implemented, will it change the auditing
job?
Considering that blockchain is being touted as a revolutionary technology that will
change many industries, it is of interest to understand whether the auditors
themselves believe that the technology will change how they work. The interviewed
auditors have had some time to understand what blockchain is, in form of the
introductory letter.
Most of the auditors believe that auditing would change if blockchain were to become
a standard used at companies. When asked why they thought so, Johanna, for
example, mentioned that auditing would become much more technical in nature. Carl
and Johan who currently work as IT-auditors stated that there are a couple of
possible outcomes. One is that financial auditors might have to learn programming
languages to be able to interact with blockchains, in addition to being technically
literate in general. The main reason for learning programming languages would so
that one could interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. This knowledge would
allow auditors to tailor-make contracts to extract information from the blockchain to
use in auditing. Johanna mentioned that if the blockchain would live up to its
promise, more time could be spent on analyzing complex transactions, and let smart
contracts take care of the easier one.
Johanna mentioned that this procedure could also give the birth to several other new
forms of auditors, one being smart-contract auditors. These would be auditors who
have been training with and have experience in checking the status of smart

50

contracts. Their purpose is to assure that smart contracts going live will not have any
vulnerabilities or serious faults. In general, the entire industry is moving more
towards data-analysis and IT related functions, meaning that the impact of
blockchain would have to be separately observed.
Martin, Peter, Thor and Per agreed that blockchain would change their jobs, but,
were not able to specify how. They all stated it is too early to say how it will cause
changes, but when implemented it would change their job description.
Of those participants, who disagreed, Stefan and Stella, stated that the auditor role
will not change, and it will remain the same. The role of the auditor will always be to
look back at past events and making sure that they have been executed correctly
and that everything is fulfilled according to the legislation. The auditor is too
important as they are now for the role to change.

Question 11. Do you perceive some fundamental weaknesses in blockchain?
The purpose of this open-ended question is to understand what kind of worries the
auditors have with this technology.
Most auditors believed there are some forms of weaknesses in blockchain. Most of
these were related to how one would make sure that information entered is to be
completely trusted. Martin, Johanna, Peter, Thor and Per did admit that the
information entered now suffers from the same issue. But since blockchain is
supposed to be trustless, it really would require new thinking and complete trust in
the technology. Per said that he does not believe the blockchain will ever be
completely independent, and it will only truly work if it is being supervised. Johan
mentioned that to completely work as intended, all control would have to be
transferred to the blockchain, and this is something he did not think would happen.
Stella mentioned that it will be interesting to see what an effect the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (also known as GDPR) will have on how blockchains work in
the European Union. One of the requirements of GDPR is that all information that
companies or service providers have of customers, can be requested to be deleted
by the customer. This goes completely against the philosophy of the blockchain,
where everything is permanent and immutable. However, it is worth noting that the

51

European Union has founded the “EU Blockchain observatory and forum”, which
serves the purpose of helping and accelerating blockchain adoption in the EU.
Therefore, the EU will most likely be looking at solutions for problems like Stella
mentioned.

Question 12. Do you have any other comments?
The last question was important, because it allowed the participants of the interviews
to convey feelings, thoughts and opinions that the interview questions might not have
captured.
Johanna, Johan, Per, Stella and Carl stated that this is an interesting development,
and they wonder how this technology will change their jobs and if it will change
during their lifetime and career. Johanna, Per and Stella stated that this issue is a bit
too technical for them, but they said that the field is changing constantly. Johan
mentioned that the auditing field in general is moving towards a more data driven
audit future. This means that by using multiple sources of data and combining them
when conducting audits, it would help reduce the workload as well as streamline the
tasks they already are doing.
Johan who has transitioned into IT auditing mentioned that in the future, financial
auditors will need to be more well versed in blockchain and understand how it works.
Johan also mentions that there might come a point where financial auditors will not
be able to work with auditing, without the knowledge of how blockchains work, and
the programming languages they utilize. This would put a large emphasis on future
education for future auditors. However, this does not mean that current auditors
would be left without a job, as the transition period might be long to get all customers
onboarded to such a system.
Stella mentioned that it is a fascinating technology, and that the single aspect that
interests them most, is the transparency that blockchain could provide to both
accounting and auditing.
Another opinion was presented by Johanna who thinks the technology will be
adopted eventually, but that the change will be positive. She didn’t have any idea of
how long it would take for blockchain to proliferate in different industries, but she

52

mentioned that it would take longer for conservative industries and companies to
accept a potential change in the status quo.

53

6. Conclusions
With reference to the interviews conducted, and results shown in the previous
chapter, the conclusions of this study can be presented in this chapter. By analyzing
the answers from the interviews, we can see that Finnish auditors working at the Big
5 auditing companies have expectations that there will be substantial changes if
blockchain technology were to be implemented into accounting and auditing.
Considering that blockchain is still a very new technology, the expectations that
auditors would be familiar with the technology were not particularly high. However,
most of the participants in this study did in fact have knowledge about blockchain
prior to this interview. Perhaps not unexpectedly they had heard about it in the
context of cryptocurrencies, mostly bitcoin, related to how these should be presented
in financial statements. Even those participants who had been asked if they were
interested in participating in interviews, but declined, mentioned that they had heard
about blockchain, but they did not feel comfortable participating as they did not think
their knowledge would suffice in giving good enough answers.
One of the more notable aspects was how the auditors taking part in the interviews
quickly understood the basic concepts of blockchain technology and were able to
give good insights into how auditors in the field would embrace this technology, as
well as considering if companies would be ready for a shift in accounting.
The introductory letter sent to participants when they agreed to take part in the
interview only served as a basic primer for the interviews. It did not contain any of
the more complicated and nuanced viewpoints that some of the auditors expressed.
Many of the expressed opinions fell in line with what the academic papers have
suggested would happen. As an example, one suggestion was that auditors would
want to use smart contracts in assisting with checking simple transactions, and they
themselves focus on complicated transactions as well as value building activities.
In addition to smart contracts playing a larger role, added security of blockchain to
accounting records was considered important. There was a split in views regarding
whether the respondents expected that immutability would in fact help to add
reliability of information. Trustworthiness on the other hand was universally agreed
on, would increase with blockchain. This is quite in line with the academic studies,

54

where it has been expected that accounting and auditing will strongly benefit from
the technical solutions that blockchain can offer.
In general, it seems like auditors are expecting changes to both accounting and
auditing if blockchain technology becomes the future standard. This would also
change how both accountants and auditors work. It is too early to say how it will alter
their jobs, but they see some changes coming, varying from total disruption on how
the career works, to changes only in the technology they use to conduct their current
jobs. However, it was also interesting to see that some auditors believed that the role
of the auditor would not change, as they are there to give assurances to
stakeholders and they will retain a role that looks at the past and not the present.
It is important to acknowledge that since blockchain is such a new technology it
could not be expected from the participants that they would understand how the
technology works from the information provided in short introductory letter. Like of
the participants said, “auditors are not well versed in understanding how the
technology they use works”, which could also be true for if auditors would be working
with blockchain technology. However, it is also possible that this would not be the
case, as the structure and functions of the blockchain is interwoven with how
accounting and auditing would work on the platform, compared to how it works today
without blockchain.
For blockchain to become an accepted technology that can be used in both
accounting and auditing, a lot of work needs to be put into understanding the usage
in those contexts. IT auditors will learn how blockchain works on a technical level
and then co-operate with financial auditors on how it could be utilized for accounting
and auditing. This should be combined with teaching financial auditors how
blockchain functions, to help them to better participate in building a framework for
how blockchains should be utilized. The Big 5 could also offer more general
education in this area, if the major companies believe it would be something that the
auditors will need to learn. There are already Big 5 branches abroad that offer
education regarding blockchain, but we are yet to see that in Finland.
Blockchain is a nascent technology and it is unknown if it will truly be as revolutionary
as some are expecting it to be. Of the interviewed auditors, most seemed to think
that the technology has a potential, but all these views are based on

55

theoretical discussions and not data-based examples. None of the auditors had
worked with blockchain ‘hands-on’, but some of them had researched it before they
were asked to participate in the interview. One of the auditors stated that the largest
issue with getting blockchain implemented, is that there is a lot of talk, but few are
doing the actual construction work. A major reason for this might be, that blockchain
has only existed since 2008. Another issue is of course the cost of investing in a
completely new technology, which is almost always more expensive than preserving
the incumbent technology. However, Finland could potentially be a good market to
test this technology, since the country is a small market with high IT-prevalence.
A view pointed out by another interviewee, was that it will be hard to get more
conservative industries to move to a new form of accounting. This conclusion in its
turn raises another question: Would there be a world where both double and triple
entry accounting exists? There are plenty of organizations that do not need triple
entry accounting and they could survive using double entry accounting, but could it
be possible that triple entry accounting would become mandatory for all
organizations?
With blockchain development currently still at an early stage, it is up to the
accounting companies to try and learn and to see what benefits they can get out of it.
Independent actors are important contributors to the future of blockchain and should
not be understated. Accounting companies can have a large impact on how this
technology will be utilized in accounting and auditing and help develop the field at
this early stage, and will potentially be very important in helping to realize how
legislation will affect accounting and auditing on the blockchain, but the time to act is
now if the companies want to shape what accounting and auditing on the blockchain
will look like.

6.1. Limitations
Although this study managed to answer the questions that were posed at the start of
this thesis, there are shortcomings. One of these is the number of participants for
this study.
This study had nine participants, and one test candidate to improve the answers.
Although a saturation point was reached, it would be optimal if a future study had
more participants to receive more answers. The limitation in this case was that

56

people do not seem to be comfortable to talk about blockchain, since they are not
completely knowledgeable on the subject. This is very understandable, and
fortunately people, who did not apparently understand or know of blockchain were
willing to participate. With this limitation in mind, it also means we can not draw any
definitive conclusions.

6.2. Future Studies
Based on the results of this study, there is a couple of recommendations for future
studies. One of these is to elaborate a questionnaire to get a larger sample of the
auditors. There are a few ways to do this. One suggestion would be to wait a couple
of years until the technology has matured a bit more. The other, is to send a
questionnaire as soon as possible, when the technology is still underdeveloped, and
gauge the sentiment of a larger population The goal of the questionnaire should be
to reach as many auditors as possible and measure their receptibility and opinions
on blockchain technology, in both an accounting and auditing setting. By sending a
questionnaire to as many as possible, we get a broader understand of what auditors
think. One of the limitations of this research was its scope, as it was limited to only
nine auditors.
Another future research would be to conduct more interviews, but with IT-auditors
working at Big 5 companies. IT auditors are the people who are at the forefront of
technology, constantly evaluating alternatives. As we can see in this research, the
IT-auditors had more expertise in this area, but they still understood how it could be
used to assist financial auditors and clients. By interviewing IT auditors, we would
receive a better understanding of whether it would be potentially feasible to use
blockchain for accounting and auditing purposes.

7. Summary in Swedish
Bokföring, revision och blockkedja – intervjuer med finländska
revisorer om blockkedja
7.1. Inledning
Ordet blockkedja är kanske mest välkänt i sammanhanget med bitcoin och andra
kryptovalutor, samt hur deras priser skjutit i höjderna och sedan sjunkit lika snabbt.
Det som dock inte ofta talas om är den praktiska användningen som blockkedjor har,
vid sidan om bitcoin och kryptovalutor. I vissa kretsar talas det om att
blockkedjeteknik kommer att bli den fjärde industriella revolutionen, vilket kommer att
förändra hur vissa branscher/sektorer fungerar.
Det här gäller även bokförings- och revisionsbranschen, eftersom Big 5 (KPMG,
Deloitte, PwC, BDO och EY) aktivt undersöker hur man kan utnyttja blockedjeteknik.
Även nya organisationer har grundats för att undersöka hur man kan integrera
blockkedjeteknik i samband med bokföring och revision.
Det finns ett stort intresse för blockkedjor, men väldigt få undersökningar har gjorts
om vad revisorerna själva anser om den teknologin som de möjligen kommer att
arbeta med i framtiden.

7.2. Syfte
Målet med den här avhandlingen är att undersöka de finska revisorernas
mottaglighet för blockkedjeteknik i samband med bokföring och revision. Eftersom
revisorer är experter på både bokföring och revision, kommer de att intervjuas
gällande möjlig användning av blockkedjeteknik på respektive område. Det är viktigt
att höra deras åsikter om den möjliga framtiden för bokföring och revision.

7.3. Teori
Blockkedja grundar sig på trippelbokföring, som i sin enkelhet innebär att det finns
tre sidor i bokföringen istället för två sidor som i dubbelbokföring. Precis som
dubbelbokföring innehåller trippelbokföring kredit- och debetsidor, men den tredje
sidan som är unik för trippelbokföring kallas för kvittot. Kvittot lagrar information om

58

vem som genomfört en transaktion, till vem den gått och varför. Ännu mera
information kan förvaras i kvittot, beroende på vad användaren vill spara. För att
kvittot ska fungera, måste det finnas en pålitlig tredje part som bekräftar dessa
transaktioner och skriver under dem med sin kryptografiska nyckel. Problemet blir
dock då hur man ska försäkra sig om att den tredje parten är pålitlig. För att lösa det
här problemet utvecklades blockkedjeteknik.
Blockkedja är en decentraliserad (distribuerad) databas i vilken kopior av samma
information lagras i noder (datorer). Informationen som lagras i en blockkedja är
krypterad i så kallade block och lagras i en lång kedja som refererar tillbaka till det
förra blocket som skapades, vilket ger tekniken namnet blockkedja. Den här
konstruktionen gör informationen på blockkedjan oföränderlig och varje förändring
som tillåts kan spåras direkt till den som gör det.
Eftersom blockkedjor är decentraliserade, måste det finnas mekanismer som
förhindrar manipulation och det här åstadkoms genom olika konsensusmekanismer.
Konsensusmekanismen innebär att nätverket på egen hand, utan en central
bestämmande kraft, kommer överens om vad som ska lagras på nätverket. Den
vanligaste konsensusmekanismen är ”Proof of Work”, eller bevis-på-arbete, som
kräver att noderna på nätverket löser kryptografiska pussel för att skapa nästa block,
som bekräftar de transaktioner som skett i nätverket. Efter att pusslet är löst, och
blocket är skapat, börjar noderna lösa nästa pussel. De noder som hjälper att lösa
ett pussel får en belöning, och beroende på hur stor del av pusslet de löst får de en
olika stor belöning. Belöningen fungerar även som ett incitament för att få flera
människor att delta i blockkedjan, eftersom ju fler deltagare det finns, desto mindre
är risken att det sker missbruk av nätverket där någon kunde äga över 51 procent av
nätverket, vilket skulle ge den en bestämmande makt över allt som sker i nätverket

7.4. Tidigare Studier
I tidigare studier om blockkedjeteknik i samband med bokföring och revision har det
indikerats att konsolideringen av transaktioner för revision skulle vara mera
tidseffektivt med blockkedjeteknik, eftersom all data skulle vara digital och
tillgängliga direkt på ett och samma nätverk. Bokföringsinformation kan teoretiskt
vara betydligt mera pålitlig, eftersom all information som sparas på en blockkedja är

59

teoretiskt oföränderlig. Strukturen hos blockkedjan skulle även göra det mycket
svårt, om inte omöjligt, att förfalska eller manipulera information. Det finns dock
fallgropar, eftersom man tekniskt sett kan mata in falsk eller manipulerad information
innan informationen når blockkedjan.
Studier som berör revision och blockkedjor påstår att framtida smarta kontrakt som
kommer att utvecklas i revisionssyfte, har potential att märkbart hjälpa revisorer att
automatisera revision. Blockkedjor kan dessutom hjälpa till att försnabba revisionen,
genom att man kan plocka fram väsentlig information snabbare digitalt, än att be
kunder söka fram fysiska verifikat. Potentiellt kan man även sköta revision i realtid,
eftersom information som matas in i blockkedjan läggs till i realtid, men det skulle
kanske/troligtvis kräva stora omställningar för revisorerna, eftersom deras yrke för
tillfället koncentrerar sig på att granska det förflutna. Överlag skulle revisorer, enligt
vissa studier, vara tvungna att anpassa sig till en totalt digital framtid där det
förväntas att de innehar kunskap om programmeringsspråk, samt hur blockkedjor
fungerar.
Det som förväntas mest från blockkedjeteknik är att smarta kontrakt skulle lätta på
arbetsbördan inom både bokföring och revision. Det finns redan smarta kontrakt
implementerade i vissa aktiva blockkedjor, som till exempel Ethereum. Smarta
kontrakt är inte ”intelligenta kontrakt”, utan små självständiga datorprogram som
utför förhandsbestämda uppgifter när vissa kriterier/omständigheter uppfylls. Ett bra
exempel i samband med bokföring, är ett inventariesmartkontrakt som sköter
betalningen av varor som kommit till lagret. En arbetstagare matar in på blockkedjan
varorna som anlänt till lagret och smart kontraktet betalar automatiskt räkningen då
den bekräftat att alla varor anlänt från leverantören. Vid revision kan smartkontrakten
ta över och granska enkla transaktioner, medan revisorerna själva granskar de mera
komplicerade transaktioner.
Det finns dock vissa nackdelar samt begräsningar med blockkedjor. En av dessa är
en så kallad ”majoritetsattacken”, vilket innebär att någon inom blockkedjenätverket
äger 51 procent av nätverkets kapacitet. Eftersom den här personen då har
bestämmandemakten över nätverket, kan dom teoretiskt ändra på information som
redan tidigare matats in på blockkedjan. Situationer som dessa är sällsynta, men

60

möjliga. En situation där det här kan hända är inom företag där det finns få noder
och blockkedjan är centraliserad.
En stor nackdel med publika blockkedjor är att informationen som lagras på dessa är
tillgängligt för vem helst. Pseudonymer kan hjälpa till att dölja vem som gör vad, men
man kan inte utesluta att någon möjligen kan avslöja vem som ligger bakom en
pseudonym.

7.5. Metodologi
Den här undersökningen är en kvalitativ studie, med intervjuer av finska revisorer om
blockkedjeteknik i samband med bokföring och revision. Orsaken till att det gjordes
en kvalitativ studie är att det undersökta området är nytt. Det finns inga tidigare
studier i Finland inom det här området och därför är det här en form av pilotstudie.
Det finns två hypoteser i den här avhandlingen:
1. Blockkedjeteknik och den distribuerade databastekniken kommer att ändra på
hur bokföring fungerar
2. Blockkedjeteknik och den distribuerade databastekniken kommer att ändra på
hur revision fungerar.
För den här studien har jag intervjuat arbetstagare från Big 5-företagen (KPMG,
Deloitte, PwC, BDO och EY). Orsaken till det här är att utomlands har Big 5dotterföretag undersökt hur blockkedjeteknik kan utnyttjas i samband med bokföring
och revision.
I det här fallet beslöt jag att revisorerna som kommer att intervjuas, skulle ha
arbetserfarenhet från två år ända upp till fyrtio år. Tanken bakom det här valet, är att
få en så bred population som möjligt, med åsikter från revisorer som nyligen inlett sin
karriär, sådana som är i mitten av sin karriär och även sådana som är i slutet av sin
karriär eller redan har pensionerat sig.
Intervjuerna utfördes både på respondenternas kontor och över telefon och skype.
Totalt var nio revisorer villiga att delta i intervjun. Att så få ville ställa upp för intervju
är inte förvånande, eftersom blockkedjeteknik är en relativt ny teknik och därför har

61

undersökts väldigt lite. I det här fallet fick jag en bra och mångfaldig population att
intervjua.
Eftersom blockkedja är en relativt ny teknik, beslöts jag att skicka ut ett
introduktionsbrev som gav en kort förklaring av tekniken, ifall de som deltog inte
hade förhandskunskaper om blockkedjor före intervjun. Tanken med intervjun var att
mäta mottagligheten samt kunskapsnivån hos revisorerna och därför skickades ett
förklaringen om tekniken.
Frågorna som ställdes till revisorerna var indelade i fyra olika kategorier:
1. Förhandskunskap om blockkedjeteknik
2. Tankar om den grundläggande teknologin.
3. Tankar om avancerade funktioner och åsikter om bokföringens samt revisionens
framtid i relation till blockkedjeteknologi
4. Den sista frågan var en öppen fråga, som gav möjlighet till respondenterna att
kommentera fritt.

7.6. Analys av Frågorna
De första två frågorna var, om respondenterna hade hört om blockkedjeteknik före
intervjun, och om huruvida företagen där de arbetar hört om blockkedjeteknik eller
om har deras kollegor uttryckt intresse för blockkedja.
Sex av de nio intervjuade hade hört om blockkedjeteknik före intervjun. I de flesta
fallen hade respondenterna hört om blockkedjor genom diskussioner om virtuella
valutor och hur de ska värderas i bokslut. Två av dessa respondenter hade fördjupat
sig i blockkedjeteknik och även gått på föreläsningar.
Överlag hade revisorerna inte lagt märke till att deras arbetsgivare uttryckt intresse
för blockkedjeteknik, men däremot hade de hört att vissa av deras konsultkollegor
och kunder uttryckt intresse.
En av de viktigaste aspekterna hos blockkedjor är oföränderligheten hos
informationen, det vill säga om information matats in på blockkedjan, kan man inte

62

gå tillbaka och ändra på den. När det kommer till bokföring och revision vill man att
bokföringsinformationen är pålitlig och därför frågas om blockkedjeteknik kan öka
pålitligheten av bokföringsinformationen. I det här fallet var det tudelat. Fyra
personer ansåg att det kommer att öka pålitligheten, eftersom informationen på
blockkedjenätverket inte går att manipulera i efterhand. Dessutom skulle
informationen bli mera pålitlig om den skulle matas in i nätverket av maskiner. De
som ansåg att det inte ökar på pålitligheten, konstaterade att informationen kunde
manipuleras förrän den sätts in på blockkedjan. Fastän blockkedjor erbjuder
oföränderlig information, betyder det inte att den inmatade informationen är 100
procent korrekt.
Blockkedjeteknik eliminerar de mänskliga mellanhänderna som kunde ha en negativ
inverkan på förtroende för informationen och därmed borde den information som
existerar på en blockkedja teoretiskt vara mera trovärd. Det finns inte en centralt
bestämmande enhet, utan alla deltagare på nätet når ett gemensamt beslut om att
den information som matats in på en blockkedja kan betraktas som pålitlig.
Respondenterna ansåg att elimineringen av mellanhänderna på en blockkedja kan
öka trovärdigheten av den information som finns på den. Eftersom informationen är
oföränderlig, kan man med stor sannolikhet anta att informationen också är
trovärdig. Respondenterna medgav att information som matas in dock kan vara
felaktig och man måste kontrollera manuellt att bokningar är korrekta.
Som tidigare nämnts kan en blockkedja antingen vara en privat eller öppen
blockkedja. Dessa två former är de mest populära, men skiljer sig stort på hur de
fungerar. Tekniskt sett är öppna blockkedjor säkrare eftersom noderna i nätverket
inte är centraliserade, men alla som vill har åtkomst till informationen har det. Privata
blockkedjor däremot kan skydda informationen bättre och endast ge tillgång åt
bekräftade användare, men risken för 51 procents attacker ökar märkbart eftersom
noderna är centraliserade. Med tanke på dessa skillnader är det viktigt att veta vad
revisorerna tror att företag kommer att använda. Alla respondenter svarade att
privata kommer att användas mest, helt enkelt för att de skulle kunna skydda vem
som har tillgång till deras information. En respondent föreslog att man eventuellt
kunde förflytta sig till en blockkedja, som administreras av ett konsortium, där flera
företag delar på noder, för att minska på riskerna.

63

En av de mest intressanta funktionerna med blockkedjor, är att den erbjuder
uppföljning av information i realtid. Teoretiskt kunde det här även användas av
revisorer för att utföra revision i realtid. De flesta av respondenterna ansåg att det
kunde vara en bra idé. Man skulle inte behöva vänta på att få information, utan man
kunde ta och direkt plocka ut det som man finner väsentligt. Det här skulle också
ändra på yrket i sin helhet. Vissa ansåg att realtid inte kommer att vara nödvändigt
och att revision alltid kommer att titta på det förflutna. Överlag skulle det finnas för
mycket oväsentlig information i en realtids revision.
Det här leder oss in på digital eller digitaliserad information, vilket blockkedjor består
av. All information på blockkedjenätverket är digitaliserat och tillgängligt från vilken
nod som helst på nätverket. Genom det här kan man alltid nå informationen,
oberoende var man är, så länge man kan nå en nod. Respondenterna ansåg att idén
är bra, men många påpekade att det finns liknande lösningar redan nu hos stora
företag. Däremot kan det vara till en stor fördel om det integreras i företagets hela
system. Vissa spekulerar att man i framtiden inte behöver åka på kundbesök, utan
istället kan man få all information man behöver direkt till ens arbetsstation.
De smarta kontrakten som nämndes tidigare, spelar även en stor roll i en möjlig
framtid där blockkedjeteknik används av revisorer. Tidigare studier gjorda på det här
området har påpekat att de smarta kontrakten kan förändra yrket märkbart. Till
exempel kan smarta kontrakt för bokföring självständigt sköta enkla bokningar,
medan bokförare övervakar processen. Det samma gäller även för revision, de
smarta kontrakten kontrollerar enkla bokningar, medan revisorerna tar hand om
mera komplicerade transaktioner. När revisorerna frågades om de anser att smarta
kontrakt för bokföring är en bra idé, ansåg de flesta att det är det. De kan lätta på
arbetsbördan, samt förhoppningsvis göra informationen mera pålitligt och se till att
det uppstår färre fel. Dock ansåg dom att man inte kan förlita sig blint på smarta
kontrakt, eftersom det möjligen kan uppstå fel.
De smarta kontrakten för revision kommer enligt respondenterna att hjälpa till att
minska på arbetsbördan. Det finns dessutom möjligheten att skräddarsy smarta
kontrakten då olika företag redovisas, vilket kommer att ge flexibilitet i områden där
det inte ännu finns det. Det finns dock en fara att revisorerna kan förlita sig för

64

mycket på vad de smarta kontrakten säger, istället för att analysera vad som
egentligen sker.
Trodde revisorerna däremot att blockkedjeteknik kommer att leda till förändringar i
deras arbetsuppgifter, ifall blockkedjeteknik tas i bruk i deras företag? Majoriteten av
respondenterna ansåg att det kommer att ske. Vissa ansåg att jobbet kommer att bli
mera tekniskt betonat, och mera fokus kommer att läggas på data-analys. Därutöver
måste revisorer också lära sig att läsa kod, samt även möjligen programmera.
Eventuellt kan det här leda till att nya revisorsroller uppkommer, som till exempel
exklusivt granskar smart kontrakt och blockkedjor. De som inte ansåg att det
kommer att förändras, sa att revisorns roll är att granska det förflutna och teknologin
kommer inte att ändra på den här rollen.
Blockkedja är en ny teknik som inte ännu har testats i bokförings- och
revisionssammanhang och därför är det viktigt att fastställa om revisorerna ser några
svagheter i teknologin. De flesta respondenterna ansåg att det finns svagheter, vilket
beror på att man inte kan vara absolut säker på att informationen som matats in på
blockkedjor är korrekt. I så fall borde man ge total kontroll över blockkedjor till
maskiner och inte låta en människa röra det.
Den sista frågan var om revisorerna om teknologin gav upphov till andra
kommentarer, som de inte kunnat uttrycka under intervjun. De som hade extra
synpunkter ansåg att det är en intressant utveckling och att det blir spännande om
teknologin bryter igenom. Överlag tror de att revision kommer att bli mera datadrivet.
Dessutom kommer det att krävas en hel del tekniskt kunnande för att kunna
genomföra revision i framtiden. Teknologin kommer att eventuellt att tas i bruk, men
de konservativa industrierna kommer att ta tid på sig att implementera det.

7.7. Slutsatser
Målet med den här avhandlingen var att ta reda på hur mottagliga de finska
revisorerna skulle vara för blockkedjeteknik, för både bokföring och revision. Det har
inte tidigare gjorts liknande studier om det här ämnet i Finland. Många av de stora
internationella bokförings- och revisionsföretagen har visat intresse för
blockkedjeteknik och det har gjorts akademiska studier om hur teknologin kunde
tillämpas inom både bokföring och revision. Problemet har dock varit att man inte

65

intervjuat revisorer, som möjligtvis kommer att arbeta med den här tekniken, om den
tas i bruk. Det är detta problem den här avhandlingen försökt lösa genom att
intervjua revisorer i Finland.
I regel verkar det som om revisorerna i Finland har ett intresse och är mottagliga för
blockkedjeteknik. Diskussionerna som fördes med revisorerna visade att dom väldigt
snabbt kunde uppfatta hur teknologin fungerar, samt hur den skulle fungera i en
revisions- eller bokföringssituation.
På basis av de första frågorna verkar det som att blockkedjeteknik inte har
diskuterats väldigt mycket bland revisorer, vilket är förståeligt, för tekniken är ny och
revisorer brukar inte analysera den teknologin som stöder deras arbete, eller hur de
olika programmen de använder fungerar.
Även trots intervjun innehöll många frågor som rörde sig kring tekniska lösningar,
vilket blockkedjetekniken erbjuder, lyckades revisorerna diskutera ämnet på en
teoretisk nivå. Till exempel var diskussionerna kring oföränderlighet intressanta, där
revisorerna ansåg att det kunde positivt påverka trovärdigheten av
bokföringsinformation, men inte pålitligheten av den.
Om blockkedjeteknik kommer att slå igenom, är det sannolikt att det är de smarta
kontrakten som revisorerna kommer att använda mest. De diskussioner som fördes
kring ämnet, antydde att revisorerna ser stora fördelar med hur de kan automatisera
olika områden inom revision och bokföring, samt göra granskningarna effektivare
och snabbare.
Genom att knyta undersökningen tillbaka till de tidigare akademiska studierna gjorda
om blockkedjeteknik och teoretisk användning av blockkedjeteknik inom bokföring
och revision, kan vi se att det skulle vara viktigt för revisorerna att få vara med att
utveckla hur teknologin kommer att användas i framtiden. Deltagarna i intervjuerna
hade många bra åsikter och frågor om teknologin och visade ett klart intresse i
framtida applikationer av den.
Om blockkedjor kommer att användas i framtiden kommer det att ändra på
revisionsyrket, vilket de flesta revisorerna medgav. Men, hur yrket kommer att

66

ändras är det ännu för tidigt att säga. Överlag verkar det redan nu som att
revisionsyrket blir mera it-kunskapskrävande ansåg vissa av de intervjuade.
Det är för tidigt att säga om blockkedjor kommer att slå igenom som ett verktyg som
kommer att användas inom bokföring och revision, men om det sker verkar det som
att de finska revisorerna är klara att ta emot nyheten och lära sig hur det fungerar
praktiskt, inte endast teoretiskt.

Word List
Blockchain: A public/private digital ledger, that is decentralized and distributed
across a network of computers to prevent real-time and retroactive manipulation of
records. Runs independently and does not require a third-party/human to confirm
transactions occurring on the network.
Consensus algorithm: An algorithm used by the blockchain network to reach an
agreement on whether the values about to be entered onto the blockchain are
indeed valid.
PoW: Proof of Work is a consensus algorithm used by multiple blockchains to
confirm the validity of transactions occurring on the network. Computers participating
on the network solve mathematical puzzles through a process called “mining”. The
more computer participates on the network, the harder the puzzle becomes to solve,
and more computational power will be required to solve the problem. Once the
puzzle is solved, the transactions that happened in-between the last puzzle was
solved and this puzzle was solved, will be verified and added to the ever-growing list
of blocks on the blockchain. Those who participated in the “mining” of the block
receive freshly minted currency that the PoW blockchain uses, as a reward. The
more computational power a “miner” gives to the network, the larger the reward.
Mining works as a method to prevent DoS attacks and spamming.
PoS: Proof of Stake is a method wherein instead of using computers to conduct
calculations, the participants on the network “stake” the tokens they own, for the
chance to be selected to verify the transactions happening on the network. The more
a participant stakes on the network, the higher the chance of being selected to verify
the transactions. Those who partake in the validation of the blocks will receive a
reward, in the form of the transaction fees that people paid to send payments on the
PoS network.
Hashrate: The amount of processing power the blockchain network has available to
conduct the “mining”.
Public blockchain: A blockchain that can be joined by anyone. Everyone on the
blockchain network can read, write and participate. Also known as a permissionless
blockchain.

68

Private blockchain: A blockchain that only can be joined if one has been given
permission. Central authority gives access to read, write and participation functions.
Also known as a permissioned blockchain.
Consortium blockchain: A blockchain that is a hybrid of public and private
blockchain. Companies are first allowed onto the network, after which they can read,
write and participate in the blockchain. They can technically see what other
companies enter onto the blockchain, but transactions might be encrypted to prevent
this. Also known as a federated blockchain.
Smart contract: A small computer program that carries out tasks when certain predetermined conditions are met, e.g. Releasing payments when all bought products
have been received.
Cryptocurrency: Is a virtual or digital peer-to-peer currency, that has been secured
by encryption.

Appendix B
Introduction letter:
Hi, my name is Niclas Gröndahl and I’m a master’s student enrolled at Åbo Akademi.
The subject I am researching for my master’s thesis is “The potential future of auditing:
Auditors opinions on the impact of blockchain in accounting and auditing”.
This accompanying letter has the purpose of explaining in basic terms what blockchain is
and giving some thoughts on what will be discussed during the interview.
The goal:
The goal of the interview is to gauge the knowledge, opinions and expectations of both
current and former auditors in Finland, in relation to blockchain in their jobs and the future of
accounting and auditing.
Among different topics that will be discussed and explored are; the reliability and trust of
information on a distributed network, digitalization of all material, immutability of information,
benefits of the same information being distributed to everyone, will companies be willing to
participate in open blockchains or will they keep themselves to private blockchains, the
automation of certain aspects through self-executing programs, will accounting and auditing
change together with regulation to support blockchain, how will the job of an auditor change,
and more.
The interview will take approximately 20-40 minutes depending on the amount of
discussion.
The next partis intended to be a refresher for those who know about blockchain and a short
introduction on the basic concepts of blockchain for those who are new to it.
A short explanation on what blockchain is:
Blockchain is the technology empowering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In its
basic essence, a blockchain is a decentralized database (also known as a digital ledger),
which has the same data distributed over all the participating computers (so called nodes) on
the network. Everyone always has the same data available.
When data is entered on the blockchain, all participants (nodes) on the network need to
reach “consensus”. Consensus means agreeing that the transaction or event took place, and
is an automated process, where no human interaction is needed. When consensus cannot
be reached, it is not entered onto the blockchain, and rejected. There exist several different
ways of reaching consensus, some are based on solving mathematical puzzles (proof of
work), others are based on the amount of stake that someone holds in the network (proof of
stake). All consensus methods have the purpose of verifying that the data being entered
onto the blockchain is legitimate.
This makes blockchains “trustless” there is no intermediary or third party overseeing the
traffic, every participant has the same rights and power, no single person or entity is in
control. Everything is solved on the network.

79
The data entered on the blockchain is immutable, which means that once it is on there, it
cannot be changed, this is by design. This record is now cryptographically sealed to prevent
tampering. Blockchains are append only, so if any changes need to be done, the data needs
to be corrected by adding or subtracting in the future. All changes are signed by a personal
“cryptographic” key. Therefore, everything that is entered leaves a trace that it is impossible
to remove and/or fake.
The integrity of the data is ensured by a cryptographic hash that is generated, which is
calculated from the content that is inside of a “block”. The block is a collection of the data
bundled together, that is being entered onto a blockchain. The hash works as a fingerprint
for a block, which proves that none of the data in that specific block has been changed after
it came into existence. Every block links to the previous blocks hash, which in turn links to
that previous blocks hash and forth. This creates a chain, of hashes which prove no data has
been tampered with. This is where the name blockchain comes from.
Blocks are uploaded with a time-delay onto a blockchain, and the speed entirely depends on
the design of the blockchain. This can allow for near real-time dissemination of information
that is being entered onto a blockchain.
If tampering did occur on a blockchain, the hash for that block would change and the chain
would break, since there would be no corresponding hashes. Tampering would be noticed
very quickly. However, manipulation of the blockchain can be done by gaining 51% of the
network capacity, with something known as a “majority attack”, although very unlikely.
Conducting a 51% attack is very resource intensive. Some blockchains are more resistant
and some less resistant to these kinds of attacks.
Any and all data can be tokenized on a blockchain. Some companies are tokenizing property
rights, supply chains and more. Currencies can also be tokenized to give a digital
representation of currencies used in the real world.
Blockchains come in many shapes and sizes, but they are normally divided into three parts:
public, private and consortium. Public blockchains are open to anyone, to both append data
to as well as view. Private blockchains are only accessible by pre-vetted participants, these
are also sometimes called permissioned blockchains. Consortium blockchains are
blockchains that are run by an organization which allows for other organizations to
participate in the usage. These are sometimes even known as corporate blockchains.
Some blockchains support “smart contracts”, which are self-executing computer programs.
They self-execute when a certain criteria or threshold has been met. An often-used example
is when a product has been received by a company and the smart contract is informed of
this, and then releases the payment to the producer who had their goods delivered. Smart
contracts are meant to automate different simple processes, with simple logic and/or
criteria.
