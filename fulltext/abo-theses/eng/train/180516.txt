The chemistry of wood is quite complex. Wood consists of several components, such
as cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and extractives, which are all important during
pulping. The components are either used as the final product or collected as byproducts in the black liquor. Some of the by-products can still be separated from the
black liquor and be utilized. One common example of a by-product which is utilized
to a much smaller extent than its actual potential is the tall oil. Typically, the tall oil
contains small amounts of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in different forms, e.g., high,
medium, or low molecular weight (MW), which originate from the antifoaming agents
that are added during pulping.
The objective of this work was to develop an improved analytical method for the
analysis of PDMS in bio-oil matrices. The experimental procedures utilized during this
work were solvent extraction and solid phase extraction (SPE). The analytical
techniques

were

to study the properties of the PDMS as it eluted through SPE cartridges, in order to
find an improved method for the fractionation. When using the pure high MW PDMS
as model compound, it was concluded that the best choice of eluent was
dichloromethane (DCM), and the best choice of cartridge material was florisil. Florisil
was chosen due to the high yield of eluted PDMS and the relatively good separation
between the PDMS and the bio-oil (BO) 1. For the previously developed SPE method,
the eluent was also DCM, however, the cartridge material was silicone hydroxide
(SiOH).
Another goal of the experimental work was to separate and concentrate the eluted
PDMS from a matrix of bio-oil. In total, there were three different bio-oil matrices
utilized. The experiments also comprised utilizing three different PDMS model
compounds (i.e., high, medium, and low MW). All three model compounds were
spiked separately in all three matrices and fractionated using the florisil cartridge.
According to the used solvent combinations during SPE fractionation, the first
fractions eluted the low MW PDMS, the middle fractions eluted the medium MW
PDMS, and the last fractions eluted the high MW PDMS. The developed florisil SPE
method was also successfully applied to separate the highly volatile D3 and D4 PDMS
degradation products from BO 1. The detection of the volatile D3 and D4 PDMS
products and the low MW PDMS was possible by GC, while the medium and high
MW PDMS were detected by HP-SEC.
The properties and potential of the florisil cartridge were compared with the SiOH
cartridge throughout this work. When considering the separation of the PDMS from
the bio-oil matrices, the florisil cartridge performed a slightly better separation than
the SiOH cartridge. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were
determined for the SPE method, using the florisil cartridge, as 37 ppm and 113 ppm,
respectively. These values were in the same range as for the previously developed SPE
method, which utilized the SiOH cartridge (30 ppm and 92 ppm). The main conclusion
from the comparison of the cartridges is that the florisil cartridge resulted in a better
separation and isolation of the PDMS from the bio-oil matrices, although based on the
LOD and LOQ for the cartridges, the SiOH cartridge was overall slightly better than
the florisil cartridge.

1 INTRODUCTION
Tall oil is a by-product from the sulfate process when producing wood pulp in pulp
mills.1 The sulfate process is more commonly known as the kraft process and the
produced pulp is called kraft pulp. The tall oil is produced when chemical compounds,
such as resin acids and fatty acids, from wood are dissolved in the cooking liquor.
Another name for the cooking liquor is black liquor. The chemical compounds from
wood form salts in the black liquor and these salts can also be called soaps. However,
the black liquor also contains unsaponifiable compounds. The soaps and
unsaponifiables are usually suspended in the black liquor. Concentration of the black
liquor with the suspension results in a separation of soaps and unsaponifiable
compounds from the rest of the black liquor. A common name for the soaps and the
unsaponifiables is tall oil soap skimming.
There are several tall oil products that can be obtained by processing tall oil in different
ways. Saponification of tall oil results in tall oil soap. Tall oil soap is also formed
through neutralization of tall oil. Acidification of the tall oil skimmings results in crude
tall oil (CTO). CTO is a dark brown mixture. To remove the dark color, CTO is treated
with sulfuric acid. This treatment results in a product called acid-refined tall oil. CTO
can also be processed via distillation, which results in distilled tall oil. During
distillation of CTO, it can be fractionated into the following fractions: tall oil fatty
acids, tall oil rosin, tall oil heads, and tall oil pitch (TOP). The tall oil fatty acids
fraction contains more than 90% fatty acids. After removal of the fatty acids, the tall
oil rosin fraction remains. The tall oil heads fraction is a result of distillation of CTO
under reduced pressure, and it is the low boiling fraction from the distillation.
Distillation of CTO results also in an undistilled fraction, which is called TOP. A
summary of the treatments of the black liquor and the products is illustrated in
Figure 1.

Since TOP remains in the undistilled fraction, it is considered as a non-volatile
compound.2 The typical yield for obtaining TOP during distillation is between 15%
and 40%. This yield is, however, strongly dependent on the quality of the used CTO.
Generally, TOP is a mixture of several different components, for example, free acids,
esterified acids and unsaponifiable compounds. The ratio between these components
is commonly 34–51% free acids, 23–37% esterified acids and 25–34% unsaponifiable
compounds. Both the free acids and the esterified acids are composed of fatty acids
and resin acids, as well as some other acids. The unsaponifiable compounds are
composed of both low-molecular and high-molecular components. Examples of some
of the most common acids, or molecules, in the components of TOP are listed in
Table 1.

CTO is a source of several useful chemicals.3 These chemicals are in a way renewable
through biorefining of CTO. Biorefining of CTO is performed by distillation into
distilled fractions and an undistilled fraction (i.e., TOP). The distilled fractions are
refined into valuable chemicals, biofuels, or other products, for example, tall oil rosin
can be used as components in adhesives or rubbers, while tall oil fatty acids can be
produced into soaps or lubricants. The TOP is reused in the pulp mills as fuel for the
pulping processes. One problem regarding the biorefining of CTO is that CTO usually
contains many impurities, which are residues from the pulping process. The impurities
can be, for example, alkali salts and soaps, fibers from cellulose, compounds of lignin3
or PDMS from antifoaming agents4, and they cause undesirable problems during
distillation of CTO.3
This work is divided into two parts: a background and an experimental section. The
first part of the background focuses on wood chemistry, pulping methods, and different
tall oil products. Some of the tall oil products are already briefly mentioned above.
However, the theoretical part of wood chemistry and pulping provides more
information to understand tall oil products and how they are formed. The second part
of the background discusses PDMS and some of the analytical methods available for
the detection of PDMS. One of the main interests of this work was the analysis of
PDMS in bio-oil products. The experimental part of this work focused on optimization
of the separation between PDMS and bio-oil by using SPE. One important aspect was
to achieve a good separation of the eluted PDMS from the bio-oil, to concentrate the
PDMS for further analyses. Several factors have been studied during SPE separation,
for example, different material of the columns or different combinations of solvents.

BACKGROUND

2.1 Wood chemistry
Trees are divided into two types: softwoods and hardwoods.5 However, it is not only
the hardness of the wood that determines which type of tree it is, since some softwood
can also be hard, and some hardwoods can be soft. Generally, softwoods produce
uncovered seeds in cones, while the seeds of hardwoods are covered and located inside
flowers. Softwoods can keep their leaves for several years, while hardwoods typically
shed the leaves every fall. Trees consist of roots, branches, leaves and a stem with
bark. From a biological point of view, trees consist of cells. The type of cells in a tree
differs depending on whether the trees are softwoods or hardwoods. In general, the
cells of trees are either structural or non-structural. The structural components of the
cells are, for example, cellulose, hemicelluloses, or lignin, while the non-structural
components are, for example, extractives or water-soluble compounds. The structural
components are located inside the cell walls and the non-structural components are
located outside the cell walls.
The main purposes of the wood cells are to provide support, to transport water, to
organize metabolism, and to store energy for the tree. The typical structure of the cells
in softwoods is a fibrous form, and therefore, the cells of softwoods are often called
fibers. The typical structure of the cells in hardwoods is rather a combination of several
cell types, for example, fibers and pores. The fibers of the hardwoods are in general
shorter and narrower than the fibers of the softwoods. As the cells reach maturity they
die, which occurs for both softwoods and hardwoods. The mature dead cells consist of
a cell wall, but they are internally empty. The empty and hollow inside of the dead
cells is called lumen.
The purpose of the cells differs depending on the location of the cells. The bark of the
tree is divided into two layers: inner and outer bark. The inner bark is only a thin layer,
which consists of living cells, while the cells of the outer bark are all dead cells. The
dead cells of the outer bark act as protection. A cross-section of the stem reveals two
different types of mature wood: sapwood and heartwood. The sapwood is the outer
part and usually lighter in the color. The cells of the sapwood are mostly dead cells,

and the functions of these cells are to support, to transport water, and to store energy.
The inner part of the stem, which is darker in the color, is called heartwood. The cells
of the heartwood are also dead, but their function is only to support. Between the
mature wood and the inner bark there is a thin layer, which is called cambium. The
cells of the cambium are all living, and their function is to produce more mature wood
(i.e., tree growth).

2.1.1

Cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin

The main components of wood are cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin.5 They are all
polymeric, and some other polymers found in smaller quantities are, for example,
starch and proteins. Cellulose is the most abundant component, and the content of
cellulose varies between 40% and 45% for both softwoods and hardwoods. However,
the content of hemicelluloses and lignin differs between softwoods and hardwoods.
Generally, softwoods contain 25–30% of both hemicelluloses and lignin, while
hardwoods contain between 30% and 35% of hemicelluloses and between 20% and
25% of lignin. Even though the content of hemicelluloses and lignin in softwoods
seems to be the same, softwoods normally consist of more lignin than hemicelluloses.
The composition of the three major components is not even throughout the whole tree.
For the purpose of pulping, non-woody material also works as raw material. Nonwoody material is lignocellulosic material other than trees, for example, grass or
residues from agriculture. Table 2 shows a brief comparison between the components
found in woody material and non-woody material.

The structure of cellulose is the same for both softwoods and hardwoods. Cellulose
consists of linear homopolymers, where the monomer is β-D-glucose in the pyranose
ring structure. The linkages between the glucose rings are (1→4)-glycoside bonds.
Hemicelluloses are in turn heteropolymers. The monomers of hemicelluloses vary
strongly and can be either hexoses, pentoses or deoxyhexoses. The variation of
monomer is noticeable when comparing softwoods to hardwoods. The hemicelluloses
of softwoods contain more of the hexoses, such as mannose and galactose, while the
hemicelluloses of hardwoods are mostly xyloses.
The structure of the lignin is significantly different from the structures of cellulose and
hemicelluloses. The main difference is the occurrence of the building units. The
building units are irregularly linked to each other with no logical order. The other
difference is the type of linkages between the building units. The linkages present in
the structure of lignin are either ether bonds or carbon–carbon bonds. The ether bonds
are present to a larger extent. The structure of lignin consists of a great variety of
functional groups. The variation of functional groups and their occurrence is not only
noticeable among different species but also between softwoods and hardwoods.
Table 3 shows a brief overview of the occurrence of the different functional groups in
softwoods and hardwoods, where the functional groups are calculated per
100 C6C3-unit.

Master’s thesis

Extractives

The term “extractives” is a name for a collection of different chemical compounds.5
This collection of chemical compounds can consist of several thousand different
compounds. In general, woody material for pulping contains between 2% and 5%
extractives, while non-woody material contains between 5% and 15% extractives. The
extractives are mainly low-molecular compounds, which can be divided into two
groups, either lipophilic or hydrophilic. The lipophilic extractives are extracted from
the wood by using organic solvents that are non-polar. The hydrophilic extractives are
extracted by using water. The extractives work as energy source for the tree or as
protection against biological attacks. They can also alter the color or smell of the wood.
Other than the chemical compounds mentioned in the previous section, the extractives
include compounds such as terpenes, fatty acids, alcohols, alkenes, lignans,
flavonoids, sugars, amino acids, or alkaloids. The amount of the different chemical
compounds varies greatly depending on, for example, the growth conditions. The total
amount of extractives in wood will naturally decrease during storage of wood. The
extractives start to decrease immediately after the felling of the tree in the forest, due
to both chemical and biological reactions that occur in the wood. The longer the wood
is stored before it is processed, the higher the reduction is in the extractives. Normally,
the amount of extractives is much higher in the heartwood and in the bark than in the
sapwood.6 The highest content of extractives is in the stem where the roots of the
branches are located.
Extractives are important compounds of the tree and they are considered to have
important roles, for example, during the pulping process.5 Firstly, the extractives are
very valuable as starting material for the production of chemicals, especially organic
chemicals. Secondly, a higher content of extractives in the wood during pulping results
in a significantly higher amount of the by-products, such as raw tall oil.
The lipophilic group of extractives consists mostly of terpenes, terpenoids and fats.6
They are also called wood resin and by using different methods of extraction, they are
isolated in different products. Tar is a black viscous liquid, which is one of the
terpenoid-based products. Tar is isolated through pyrolysis of wood. One of the
7

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

terpene-based products is, for example, turpentine. One method for the isolation of
turpentine is through condensation of the formed gases during kraft pulping. Tall oil
is a so-called rosin product, and it is isolated through distillation of the by-product
from the kraft cooking (i.e., CTO). The fats are mainly grouped into triglycerides and
steryl esters. The triglycerides are isolated as tall oil fatty acids through distillation of
CTO. The steryl esters are also isolated through distillation of CTO, however, they
remain in the undistilled TOP fraction.

Extractives during pulping
Extractives are greatly affecting the pulping process, for example, in the way they
interact with the cooking liquor.7 Factors that play a role in the effect of extractives
during pulping are, for example, the quantity of extractives or the chemical
composition of extractives. The quantity of extractives is naturally varying between
species and between woody and non-woody materials. Generally, the yield of the pulp
is reduced with an increasing quantity of extractives in the raw material. Different
chemical compounds of extractives cause different chemical reactions during pulping,
for example, discoloration or formation of unwanted deposits. The discoloration is a
typical problem for wood storage, and it occurs due to oxidation reactions, which result
in dark products. Unwanted deposits can, for example, be accumulated resin that
results in blockage in the production line.
The effects of extractives during the pulping process are generally considered as
negative. Some more specific and practical effects will now be discussed briefly.
During the impregnation of the wood chips in chemical pulping, the penetration rate
is reduced. The extractives partly inhibit the penetration of the cooking liquors,
however, the intensity of the inhibition is strongly dependent on the quantity of the
extractives. During alkaline pulping (i.e., kraft pulping), the used sodium hydroxide
(i.e., alkali) reacts more rapidly with the extractives than with the target compound
(i.e., lignin). This phenomenon allows less sodium hydroxide to be available for
reactions with lignin, and the outcome is a required increase of the consumption of the
pulping chemicals. During kraft pulping, the extractives can also react with the lignin
due to condensation reactions. The product is a much larger fragment of lignin and the
result is a decrease of the solubility of lignin.

Inorganic constituents

The inorganic constituents of trees are considered as everything which is obtained after
combustion of all the organic content (i.e., the ash).5 Normally, the ash consists of
several metal oxides, but it can contain whichever element other than carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The amount of ash varies between 0.3% and 1.5% for
both softwoods and hardwoods. A difference in the ash content is noticeable due to
environmental factors, such as the type of available nutrition, the climate, or the growth
location. Some of the inorganic constituents are vital for tree growth. In general,
however, the inorganic constituents are considered as inconvenient during pulping
processes.

2.2 Pulping and biorefining
From an environmental point of view, biorefining is a positive method for the process
of converting biomass into energy, biomaterials, and chemicals.8 Instead of using fossil
resources, biorefining produces valuable products using renewable raw materials. The
raw material for biorefining varies widely, however, the most commonly used raw
material is rich in cellulose (e.g., wood or non-wood materials). The raw material for
the process of biorefining can be treated in several ways, resulting in several different
products. The three main processing methods for biorefining are mechanical,
chemical, and thermal. The compounds that make up wood, as previously mentioned
(e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives), all react differently during
biorefining processes.
The process of converting cellulose-rich raw material into a mass of fibers is called
pulping. The mass of fibers is called, as a product, pulp. For modern pulp mills the
pulp is not the only product. During the pulping process, several other by-products are
also formed. The main application of the pulp is for papermaking. Other minor
applications of the pulp are for cellulose derivatives or for regeneration of cellulose.
The by-products also have important applications. Depending on the application of the
pulp, the pulp is produced according to different pulping methods. A brief summary

of the different biorefining processes, starting from the raw material and ending with
the pulp and black liquor, is illustrated in Figure 2.

mechanical pulping, the lignin is not dissolved, however, it is softened, which enables
the separation of the fibers from the lignin. The first step of the process of mechanical
pulping is the grinding of the raw material. There are two way for this step: grinding
or refining.
During grinding, the debarked logs are pushed from two sides towards a rotating
grindstone.10 During the process of grinding, water is added to the contact area
between the logs and the grindstone, in order to decrease the heat generated from the
friction. The surface of the grindstone is covered with grits, which tear away the fibers
in the wood. Normally, grinding occurs in atmospheric pressure and this process is
called atmospheric groundwood. A variation of the grinding is a pressurized
10

groundwood process, where the grinding occurs in a pressurized chamber. The
pressure allows a higher temperature to be generated on the surface of the grindstone,
and because of this the lignin is easier to soften.
The refining process starts with wood chips.11 The wood chips are fed into the center
of a refiner, where there are grooves and gaps. The refiner is rotating and creating a
centrifugal force, which forces the wood chips to travel outwards. At the same time as
the wood chips travel outwards, they are defibrated and fibrillated due to interactions
between the grooves and gaps.

Chemical pulping
The chemical pulping is divided into two main processes: kraft pulping and sulfite
pulping.8 A comparison of the kraft and sulfite pulping processes shows some
differences in the properties of the processes. During the kraft pulping, the yield of the
process is approximately 50%. The pulp that is produced during kraft pulping is a
relatively strong pulp. The kraft pulping process also has low specificity on the raw
material. The main advantage of the sulfite pulping process is the high brightness of
the produced pulp before bleaching. Other advantages are, for example, a higher yield
and a cheaper investment. The difference between the processes is that the sulfite
pulping process can be performed at both low and high pH values, while the kraft
pulping process is only performed at high pH values.

Kraft pulping
The principle of kraft pulping, or sulfate pulping, is a cooking of the raw material, such
as wood chips.8 The wood chips are treated with cooking liquor, which in this case are
the chemicals sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The active ions from the cooking
chemicals are the sulfide ion, which mainly reacts with the lignin during cooking, and
the hydroxide ion, which mainly reacts with the carbohydrates during cooking.
Extractives react through hydrolysis reactions. After completed pulping between the
cooking liquor and the feedstock, the pulp is washed in order to remove the cooking
liquor. The washed cooking liquor mainly consists of dissolved by-products, such as
lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives.

Master’s thesis

The aim of the reactions involving the lignin is delignification. The reactions, which
results in delignification, are mainly the cleavage of the aryl ether linkages in the lignin
structure. Other reactions involving lignin are demethylation and condensation. The
delignification reactions result in smaller fragments of lignin, which are soluble in
water and become dissolved in the cooking liquor.
Reactions due to the hydroxide ion affect the carbohydrates. Common reactions of
carbohydrates during kraft pulping are deacetylation, peeling, stopping and alkaline
hydrolysis. The peeling reaction is the removal of an end group in a carbohydrate
chain. The stopping reaction converts the end group into an alkali-stable unit and
because of that, peeling is prevented. Alkaline hydrolysis is the cleavage of a
glycosidic linkage anywhere in the carbohydrate chain. Alkaline hydrolysis results in
new end groups that are involved in secondary peeling. The reactions of carbohydrates
mainly affect the hemicelluloses because of their low crystallinity and low degree of
polymerization.

Sulfite pulping
The sulfite pulping is another chemical conversion of the raw material. 8 The sulfite
pulping process is quite similar to the kraft pulping process. The difference between
the two processes is the cooking chemical. The cooking chemical for sulfite pulping is
sulfur dioxide. The active ions from the cooking chemical for sulfite pulping are
hydrogen sulfite ions and sulfite ions. The concentrations of the active ions are highly
dependent on the pH of the cooking liquor. The change in the concentrations of the
active ions according to the pH is due to a formation of an equilibrium between sulfur
dioxide and water.
The reactions that occur during sulfite pulping are somewhat different in comparison
to the reactions of the kraft pulping. It is the same chemical compounds of the raw
material that react (i.e., lignin, carbohydrates, and extractives), however, the type of
reactions differs. The main goal for the reactions of the lignin is delignification.
Delignification occurs during sulfite pulping due to sulfonation and hydrolysis. The
sulfonation adds sulfonic acid groups to the lignin structure. The hydrolysis cleaves

12

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

the aryl ether linkages in the lignin structure. As a result of these reactions, the lignin
fragments become more hydrophilic and more soluble in water.
The reactions of the carbohydrates are depending on the pH of the cooking liquor. At
low pH values, the main reaction of the carbohydrates is hydrolysis. At high pH values,
some peeling of the carbohydrates can also occur. In general, the carbohydrate
reactions only affect the hemicelluloses. Reactions of the extractives can be, for
example, sulfonation or dehydrogenation.

2.2.2

Unconventional pulping technologies

The aim of the traditional pulping methods is to obtain the fibers of the biomass, while
not caring much about the rest of the components of the biomass. 12-14 The components
that are dissolved in the cooking liquor, or black liquor, are considered by-products,
however, they are usually heavily degraded. There are though good efforts to also
utilize the by-products in the black liquor, in order to give a high yield as possible for
the utilization of biomass. The unconventional pulping technologies, however, focus
on the extraction of the so-called by-products, resulting in non-degraded by-products
and a more extensive utilization of the biomass.

BLN-pulping
The BLN-pulping method is used for extraction of biomass. 13,14 The method is still
under development, but the main principle is to use hot water to extract the
hemicelluloses. The crucial step is in the beginning, when all air must be removed by
reducing the pressure. If oxygen is present, the hemicelluloses will degrade. The airfree biomass is then impregnated with hot water. During the extraction, the same
extraction water is circulated several times through the biomass. This is positive, as
there is a minimal use of water and as the circulation also results in a higher
concentration of the extracted components. The BLN-pulping method can also be
applied to extract the lignin from the biomass. In that way, the extracted lignin is
sulfur-free, in contrast to the sulfur-containing lignin obtained from the traditional
pulping method.
13

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

Organosolv pulping
Organosolv pulping is also considered an unconventional pulping technology because
the method utilizes organic solvents for delignification of biomass.12 The advantage of
using organic solvents over the traditional pulping methods, is that the removed lignin
and other by-products are much less degraded and can easily be recovered for further
utilization. The process of organosolv pulping is based on using a mixture of organic
solvents and water, usually with a ratio ranging between 10 vol% and 50 vol%.15 The
process operates at high temperatures, around 200 ℃. Another advantage of using the
organosolv pulping method is that more lignin is removed resulting in a higher
concentration of cellulose in the pulp.

2.2.3

Other technologies for pulping

The thermal pulping is usually combined with both mechanical and chemical pulping,
creating processes called thermomechanical pulping 9 or thermochemical pulping.16
There are also combinations of mechanical and chemical, called chemimechanical
pulping, and even a combination of all three processes, called chemithermomechanical
pulping.9
After grinding or refining of mechanical pulps and after cooking of chemical pulps,
the pulp is further treated according to several steps.17 The first after-treatments are
washing and screening. Washing is performed in order to recover unwanted dissolved
material and chemicals. The dissolved materials can be used, for example, as fuel,
while the chemicals are reused. Screening is a process that removes impurities from
the pulp. The impurities in pulp are usually solid material, such as uncooked wood
chips or larger wood pieces. Another after-treatment step is bleaching.18 The main goal
of bleaching is to remove lignin and increase the brightness of the final pulp. There
are several different methods that all achieve some bleaching on their own, however,
to reach maximized bleaching of a pulp, a sequence of many different bleaching steps
is required.

Refining of crude tall oil (CTO)

As previously mentioned, CTO is a by-product from the pulping processes.19 Although
CTO contain several valuable chemical compounds, CTO is almost never used as
unrefined. CTO in an unrefined state creates problems for the use of the specific
compounds. The use of the fatty acids from unrefined CTO in the soap industry is
negatively affected due to the presence of the rosin acids. Likewise, processing of rosin
acids from unrefined CTO is disturbed by the presence of the fatty acids. Due to these
problems, CTO needs to be refined in order to separate the components from each
other. This section will discuss some methods for separating the components of CTO.

Distillation
The components of CTO are very likely to decompose at high temperatures. 19 The
rosin acids start to decompose at temperatures below 250 ℃. As the temperature rises
above 250 ℃ and towards 300 ℃, the decomposition of the components increases.
This can cause problems during distillation and to prevent the occurrence of the
problems, the distillation is usually performed under vacuum. An increase in the
vacuum enables a decrease of the boiling points of the components. With a lower
boiling point, the components can be heated until they are boiling without any
decomposition.
Normal distillation, or simple distillation, is hardly ever used because the fractionation
of the components is highly limited. The simple distillation mostly removes only
unpleasantly smelling compounds and dark colored residues, leaving the fatty acids
and rosin acids still present in the CTO. Because of this, the distilled CTO by simple
distillation has a low quality. Instead, to increase the quality and the fractionation of
the components, the distillation can be carried out by using fractionating columns.
With the aid of the columns, the distillation enables removal of unwanted products and
separation of the fatty acids and rosin acids. However, the distilled separated fractions
are never ideal and perfect. The distillation is performed several times. With every new
distillation, the temperature of the process is lowered. Decrease of the temperature will
also decrease the extent of decomposition.

15

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

The vacuum distillation with the fractionating columns enables an almost complete
separation of the fatty acids from the rosin acids. However, a separation between the
different types of fatty acid components (e.g., stearic acid or oleic acid) is not possible
through distillation alone. To enable further separation of the different types of fatty
acids, which can also be called saturated or unsaturated, solvent extraction is required.
Saturated (e.g., stearic acid) and unsaturated (e.g., oleic acid) fatty acids have different
solubility in polar and non-polar solvents. To increase the separation even more,
columns are used here in the same way as for the simple distillation.
CTO consists of a low-boiling fraction, which can also be called light oil. The light oil
is the first fraction obtained from the distillation. This light oil fraction contains a
variety of different compounds, such as unpleasantly smelling compounds, dark
colored compounds, unsaponifiables, or decomposition products. Light oil is also
being separately refined by distillation. Distillation of light oil is difficult due to the
highly similar boiling points of the components. For this reason, fractionating columns
with a high fractionation capacity are used for distillation. The distillation residue (i.e.,
TOP) from CTO also contains valuable chemical compounds. The TOP fraction
corresponds to approximately 15–40 % of the CTO. TOP is mainly used as softeners
in asphalt or as fuel oil.

Extraction
Extraction of CTO is divided into two types: batch extraction and continuous
extraction.19 The batch extraction is mainly performed to remove some of the
unwanted and unimportant components of the CTO, as this is not a method to separate
the fatty acids from the rosin acids. Solvents that have been used in successful batch
extraction are, for example, petroleum ether or furfural. The batch extraction results in
a high yield of a combination of fatty acids and rosin acids. In general, the yield is
between 85% and 95%.
The continuous extraction is a refining method that can be used to separate the fatty
acids from the rosin acids. The yield of the separated fatty acids and rosin acids is
higher for the continuous extraction than for the distillation. This advantage is possibly
due to lower temperature used during continuous extraction. However, the purity of
16

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

the products from the continuous extraction are not as high as for the products from
the distillation.

Refining CTO into fuel
As previously mentioned, CTO can be refined into fuel.20 One method for this involves
a series of different steps. This method results in diesel fuel with a high quality and
high yield. The formed diesel from refining CTO is also called second-generation
diesel. The problem with refining CTO is the contaminants (e.g., alkali salts, sulfurcontaining compounds, lignin, or fibers). When refining for second-generation diesels,
the contaminants should first be removed in order to avoid any kind of production
problems.
The first step of the method invented by Stigsson and Naydenov20 is to remove any
kind of contaminant which is of non-oil character. This is achieved through specific
reactions and separations. The residue from this step is called refined tall oil stream.
The second step is to remove a volatile fraction. This volatile fraction is easily removed
by treating the refined tall oil stream firstly in a heat-exchanger and secondly in a
stripping unit. The residue from the second step is an oil stream containing components
with high boiling points (e.g., 170 ℃ or higher). The third step is performed through
a separation of the oil stream. This separation is achieved by using a vacuum
distillation column. The oil stream is separated into two fractions, where the first
fraction is components with boiling points between 170 ℃ and 400 ℃, and the second
fraction is components with boiling points above 400 ℃. The last step of the method
is treatment of the fraction of components with boiling points between 170 ℃ and
400 ℃. This fraction is forced through a catalytic reactor for deoxygenation. The same
fraction is further forced though a second catalytic reactor, which this time is for
hydrogenation and desulphurization, before the fuel is formed.

2.3 Tall oil products
2.3.1

Chemical composition

The main components in tall oil products are, as mentioned, fatty acids, resin acids and
unsaponifiables.21 The unsaponifiables are also called neutral compounds, as they are
non-acidic. The chemical composition of tall oil products is strongly dependent on
several different factors.1 The two main factors are the geographical location and the
species of the trees used as raw material for the pulp.
As an example, when starting from the southeastern areas of United States and moving
north all the way to Canada, the chemical composition varies greatly. In the south, the
composition of tall oil is 40–50% resin acids, 6–8% unsaponifiables and the rest is
fatty acids, which is normally lower than the amount of resin acids. About halfway
towards Canada, the amount of resin acids is 30–35%. The decrease in resin acids
results in an increase in the amount of fatty acids instead. In the north, the amount of
resin acids decreases even further, to about 25%, while the amount of unsaponifiables
increases to 12–25%. These differences are also detectable in other parts of the world.
In Finland, the composition of tall oil varies between 22% and 49% resin acids, 35%
and 71% fatty acids, and 6% and 28% unsaponifiables. Other factors that affect the
composition occur during the pulping process, which can be, for example, oxidation
or isomerization during chip storage and pulping.
The fatty acids in tall oil products consist mostly of compounds with 18 carbon atoms,
but some compounds with 16 or 20 carbon atoms are also found. 21 Common C18 fatty
acids are, for example, stearic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid. Examples of C16 and
C20 fatty acids are palmitic acid and eicosadienoic acid, respectively. The chemical
structures of the mentioned fatty acids are illustrated in Figure 3. The resin acids, in
tall oil products, have similar carbon backbone, which consists of three fused ring
systems.1 The most common resin acids are, for example, dehydroabietic acid, abietic
acid and palustric acid. The chemical structures of the common resin acids are
illustrated in Figure 4. The unsaponifiables are mainly alcohols.21 The most common
component is sitosterol, but other alcohols, such as 24 carbon atoms lignoceryl

18

alcohols are also found among the unsaponifiables. The chemical structures of the
common unsaponifiables are illustrated in Figure 5.

2.3.2

Chemical and physical properties

The components in tall oil products (i.e., the fatty acids and the resin acids) can be
modified through several different reactions.1 The fatty acids are linear with both
saturated and unsaturated chains, but they also have a carboxyl group. Based on this,
the chemical modifications of fatty acids can be divided into two types. The first type
is modification due to a double bond and the second type is modification due to the
carboxyl group. Examples of chemical reactions involving the double bond are
dimerization, epoxidation, and ozonolysis. Examples of reactions involving the
carboxyl group are formation of salt, esterification, and preparation of nitrogen
derivatives. The functional groups of resin acids are the same as for fatty acids (i.e.,
double bond and carboxyl group), though the structure of resin acids is cyclic instead
of linear. Modifications of resin acids are divided into the same two types as for fatty
acids. Examples of reactions involving the double bond in resin acids are
isomerization, disproportionation, hydrogenation, and dimerization. Examples of
reactions involving the carboxyl group in resin acids are formation of salt and
esterification.
The physical properties of the tall oil products that will now be shortly discussed are
vapor pressure (or volatility), solubility, and viscosity. The volatility of TOP is low
20

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

(i.e., non-volatile component). Even though TOP is non-volatile it contains volatile
components, which have a low vapor pressure. The components of tall oil are insoluble
in water. They are, however, soluble in, for example, alcohols, esters, and ketones. The
viscosity of CTO is dependent on its temperature. Storing CTO in temperatures below
50 ℃ results in a high viscosity, due to crystals that forms or that CTO solidifies.

2.3.3

Applications

There are many different applications of tall oil, however, the application is dependent
on what kind of tall oil product that is being used.1 The products that are most widely
used are tall oil fatty acids and tall oil rosin. Due to economic reasons, it is, however,
crucial to also use all other tall oil products. Now following a brief mentioning of some
applications of tall oil products.
The tall oil fatty acids fraction can be divided into two classes: fatty acids with less
than 2% resin acids, and fatty acids with between 2% and 10% resin acids. One
application of tall oil fatty acids is the manufacturing of dimer acids or polyamine
condensates. Other applications of tall oil fatty acids are, for example, as protective
coatings, soaps, detergents, disinfectants, lubricants, textiles, and rubber products. The
tall oil rosin fraction is also divided into two classes: tall oil rosin with high content of
dehydroabietic acid, and tall oil rosin with sulfur content between 400 ppm and
600 ppm. The largest application of tall oil rosin is the production of chemicals, such
as resins, emulsifiers, or plasticizers. Tall oil rosin is also widely used in paper making
processes, and especially for sizing of paper. Other end uses of tall oil rosin are, for
example, inks, adhesives, coatings, floor coverings, and rubber.
The tall oil products, which are not as widely used as tall oil fatty acids and tall oil
rosin acids, are CTO, distilled tall oil, tall oil heads, and TOP. CTO is mostly used for
distillation. Although, a small part of CTO is used in, for example, ore flotation. The
composition of distilled tall oil is 25–40% resin acids and 60–75% fatty acids. Distilled
tall oil together with lime results in wall paint. Distilled tall oil is also used to produce
surfactants of various types (e.g., water-soluble, oil-soluble, anionic, or cationic). The
tall oil heads fraction is used within ore flotation, due to the high content of
21

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

unsaponifiables in the fraction. Palmitic acid is concentrated in the tall oil heads
fraction, and from there it is produced into pure palmitic acid through solvent
crystallization. The TOP fraction has a much higher content of unsaponifiables than
the tall oil heads fraction. Even though, TOP is used to produce alkyd-type coating
resins. TOP also has a great usage as an asphalt additive. As the TOP fraction contains
a low content of sulfur, the TOP fraction is used as a valuable fuel.

2.4 Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS)
2.4.1

PDMS in pulp and paper industry

In the pulp and paper industry, antifoaming agents are used.22 The antifoaming agents
are used to decrease the formation of foam during the pulping process. When air is
entrained in the pulping system, it causes several production problems, for examples,
the effectiveness of the system, the quality of the paper, and the properties of the paper
are all decreased. Normally, entrained air also results in generation of air bubbles (i.e.,
foam). The antifoaming agents are added chemicals that work in one of two ways. The
added chemicals either prevent foam formation in the first place or they destroy
already formed foam. Strictly speaking, the term antifoaming agent is a chemical used
to prevent foam formation and it is usually added before foaming processes, while the
term defoamer is a chemical used to break down already existing foam and is added
after formation of foam. A couple of criteria for a chemical to work as an antifoaming
agent or a defoamer are, for example, that it should be surface active, it must be
insoluble in water, and it should have the ability to form dispersed particles.
During the pulp and paper production, several steps cause formation of foam. 23 One
example is when washing the kraft pulp, foam is formed in the black liquor. Generally,
there are four factors that, if they are present, allow the formation of foam. These
factors are as follows: a liquid, chemical agents, air, and mechanical energy. Without
defoamers, the formation of foam would be immense. Foam in the pulp and paper
industry leads to production problems or even problems with safety or the
environment. The created foam fills up the volume of the production tanks and results
in a decreased capacity of the tanks, which is considered a production problem.
22

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

There are four different types of defoamers available, which are chemically different:
oil-based, silicones, surfactants, and emulsions.22 Oil-based defoamers contain a
matrix of oil with dispersed particles of, for example, wax or silica. Silicones, or
silicone-based defoamers, contain a matrix of silicone oil with dispersed silica
particles. Surfactants are derivatives from fatty alcohols. Emulsions contain a matrix
of water with dispersed wax emulsions or additives. The most used type of antifoaming
agents or defoamers is silicones, with the silicone oil typically originating from
PDMS.24 The surface of the dispersed silica particles is commonly hydrophobic, due
to a chemical treatment.25 This hydrophobicity allows the silica particles to act as
active bubble breakers. The PDMS is used as a source for antifoaming agents and
defoamers mostly due to its low surface tension energy.26
As previously mentioned, silicones are antifoaming agents or defoamers based on
silicone oil and dispersed particles.24 Both the silicone oil and the hydrophobic
particles can act as an antifoaming agent or defoamer by themselves, however, a
combination of the oil and the particles is a more effective alternative. The silica
particles are generally between 0.1 µm and 10 µm in size, and together with the PDMS
oil, the particles are forming a solid–oil droplet of hydrophobic characteristics. These
hydrophobic droplets will attack and destroy the foam according to one of two
mechanisms: fluid entrainment or film pinch-off. The mechanism of the fluid
entrainment works when the droplet spreads out on the foam film between the air–
water interface and generating thinning of the film until it ruptures, and the foam is
destroyed. The mechanism of the film pinch-off works when the droplet forms a lens
on the foam film between the air–water interface and instead of spreading out, the
droplet forms a bridging formation between the films. The bridging droplet pinch off
the film at the contact points, resulting in rupture and destroying of the foam.
A study has been carried out by Chen et al. for which they studied the effectiveness of
the PDMS-based antifoaming agents.27 The result from the study is that with a higher
concentration of antifoaming agent, the more likely the PDMS oil will spread out. With
a lower concentration of antifoaming agent, the droplets are more diluted and have a
lower possibility to work according to the mechanisms mentioned earlier. Other results
were that the effectiveness generally increases with increased viscosity of the PDMS.
23

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

There is another study carried out by Patterson, regarding the effect of the antifoaming
agent because of different properties of the silica in the antifoaming agent. 25 For this
study, the antifoaming agent was prepared by a method called in-situ hydrophobing.
The effect, or the performance, of the antifoaming agent was studied for the defoaming
of black liquor. The studied parameters were pH, particle size and addition of a
promoter. For antifoaming agents with the same pH but different particle size, the
study showed that smaller particle sized silicates had a better ability to defoam. When
comparing antifoaming agents with the same particle size but different pH, the study
showed that a more neutral or acidic pH had better ability to defoam. The studied pH
values were 6.3 and 8.6. When comparing the addition of a promoter at different pH
values (i.e., 6.3, 8.6, and 9.7), the study showed that the promoter greatly increased the
ability to defoam for the acidic pH value (i.e., 6.3). The addition of the promoter at
alkaline pH values did not significantly change the ability to defoam.
The silica from the antifoaming agents and the defoamers is a problem in pulp and
paper industry especially when considering industrial oil refining. 4 The silica results
in several problems during refining, for example, a decrease of the efficiency of the
hydrotreating catalysts or a formation of unwanted deposits in the production units.

2.4.2

Silicone polymers

PDMS is one of the most common silicone polymeric compounds. 28 Silicone polymers
are characteristic for the repeating oxygen and silicon units in their backbone. The
silicon atoms are also bonded to branches, which most commonly are organic groups
(e.g., methyl, phenyl, or vinyl). The repeating unit, where silicon is bonded to one
oxygen and two side groups, is called siloxane. In the case where the polymer consists
of methyl groups as side groups, the structure is called polydimethylsiloxane. The
repeating unit of siloxane is illustrated in Figure 6.

repeating unit of PDMS.
Besides the repeating unit in PDMS, the polymer also needs termination at the ends in
some way. For PDMS, the ends are terminated with a so called trimethylsilyl unit at
each end. In the trimethylsilyl unit, the silicon atom is bonded to one oxygen and three
methyl groups. The complete structure of PDMS is illustrated in Figure 7.

The units, or building blocks, of silicone polymers can also be abbreviated to only one
letter. The siloxane unit is abbreviated with the letter D (i.e., from “di“), because the
silicon atom in the unit can expand the chain in two directions through the oxygen
atoms. With the same principal, the trimethylsilyl unit is abbreviated with the letter M
(i.e., from “mono”), due to the silicon can expand only in one direction. There are also
two other units, T (i.e., from “tri”) and Q (i.e., from “quad”), where the silicon atom
can expand in three or four directions, respectively. The structures of all four units are
illustrated in Figure 8. Following this rule of nomenclature, the PDMS can also be
referred to as MDnM.

Properties and applications

The properties of silicone polymers differ distinctly to the properties of carbon
polymers, even though the silicon and carbon atoms are in the same group in the
periodic table.29 The bond lengths of silicon are longer than the bond lengths of carbon.
Silicon has a much lower electronegativity than carbon. Due to this, silicon together
with oxygen results in an extremely polarized bond, in comparison with the polarity
of the carbon–oxygen bond. The highly polarized silicon–oxygen bond can without
protection result in intermolecular interactions. Luckily, the methyl groups will protect
the main chain. Protection of the main chain is also a result of the flexibility of the
chain. The rotation energy for the siloxane unit is low, which results in a silicone
polymer that can occur in many conformations.
Some specific properties of PDMS are, for example, that they possess a low surface
tension. A low surface tension gives the polymers the ability to wet most surfaces. The
glass transition temperature of PDMS, and silicone polymers in general, is very low.
A cross-linked PDMS polymer will appear as an elastomer in room temperature, even
though it is without plasticizers. The polymers also have a high gas permeability,
especially to oxygen, nitrogen, or water vapor.
Silicone polymers have lots of useful properties, and they can also easily be modified.
This results in a wide range of applications for silicone polymers. The applications of
silicone polymers in personal care, pharmaceutical industry, food industry, and pulp
and paper industry are very common and will now be briefly discussed.
The type of silicone polymer used in personal care products varies greatly. Many
silicone polymers with structural differences are used because they enhance the
performance of beauty products. In general, the silicone polymers can, for example,
result in good spreading or waterproofing, and enhance volatility or permeability of
the beauty product. These structural differences of the silicone polymers are related to
the molecular weight, the chemical structure or the substituents present on the
backbone. Examples of the performance related to each structural difference are good
spreading for silicone polymers with low molecular weight, smooth and soft feel on

the skin for silicone polymers with long linear chains, and more shiny effect for
silicone polymers with phenyl substituents.
Differences in the silicone material are also useful in the pharmaceutical industry.
Variation of the chemical structure results in different silicone materials, such as fluids,
gels, elastomers, and adhesives, which all have specific advantages and specific
pharmaceutical applications. Examples of applications are the usage of fluids as
lubrication or drug carriers, gels as wound dressing, elastomers as implantation devices
(e.g., pacemakers), and adhesives as temporary devices on skin (e.g., catheters) or as
transdermal drug delivery systems. One other major advantages of silicone polymers
in pharmaceutical application is their good biocompatibility, which allows for a great
variety of pharmaceutical applications. The low surface tension and high gas
permeability of silicone polymers are also useful properties for pharmaceutical usage.
One of the major process-related problem in both food industry and in pulp and paper
industry is foam. Production of foam decreases the efficiency of the process and the
important compound to decrease foam is antifoaming agents, or foam control agents.
PDMS materials are excellent for the usage as antifoaming agents mainly due to the
combination of properties of PDMS, such as low surface tension and flexibility of the
backbone. In the food industry it is vital that the additives (i.e., antifoaming agents) do
not result in poisonous food products. PDMS-based antifoaming agents have an
advantage for this due to the chemical inertness of PDMS. Another application of
silicone polymer in food industry is for lubrication of production equipment. Other
than antifoaming agents, the silicone polymers can also be used as additives in the pulp
and paper industry. The silicone material in the additives works either to enhance the
impregnation of the wood chips or to increase the softness of tissues. In the recycling
step of paper, silicone polymers will also work as aids for the process of de-inking.

2.5 Analysis of PDMS
2.5.1

Common analytical techniques for analyzing silicone polymers

There are several analytical techniques which allow for determination of silicone
present at trace levels.30 For trace level analysis, sample preparation is critical. Usually,
the sample preparation is a form of extraction of silicone from different matrices. The
most convenient extraction is by using organic solvents. The following paragraphs will
present some of the common analytical techniques for analyzing silicone and silicone
polymers: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), GC, nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), size
exclusion chromatography (SEC), inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry
(ETAAS). All the techniques are available for coupling with different detectors, and
the parameters for the techniques vary somewhat. A brief summary of the parameters
for PDMS analysis with the mentioned techniques is found in Table 4.

Analysis of silicone polymers can easily be performed by using FTIR. 29 The principle
for the FTIR analytical technique is to identify organic compounds as they are exposed
to infrared radiation.37 FTIR is an extensively available analytical technique, which
not only detects the silicone polymers, but also acquires information regarding the
chemical structure.29 However, the FTIR method works best when the sample is
composed of isolated analytes, meaning that with a combination of several unknown
analytes it is difficult to receive acceptable results. 37 As an analytical technique for
28

Charlotte Holmberg

detecting silicone polymers, FTIR usually has a LOD of 1%.29 Using FTIR, PDMS
structures can be separated from, for example, trimethylsilyl groups or copolymers.
Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) is a possible
variation of this analytical technique.38 The FTIR-spectrum provides information
about the wavelengths of the different chemical structure that are present in the sample.
A typical FTIR-spectrum of PDMS shows peaks at about 792 cm -1, 1047 cm-1,
1260 cm-1, and 2955 cm-1. The corresponding chemical structures of PDMS is
summarized in Table 5.

Another technique for analyzing silicone polymers is GC. 29 The principle for the GC
analytical technique is to measure volatile components in a sample.39 The sample is
injected and separated in a heated column. GC coupled with mass spectroscopy
(GC-MS) allows for detection of low-molecular cyclic siloxanes, which indicate the
presence of silicone polymers.29 However, GC-MS cannot be used for accurate
quantification of silicone polymers. Accurate quantification using the GC technique is
possible by coupling GC with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Analytical
standards are used for comparison when analyzing unknown analytes with GC.40 The
standards are either internal or external, however, they should be analyzed with the
same conditions as the unknown analyte.

29

NMR is an analytical technique that acquires detailed information regarding the
silicone polymer structure.29 The principle for the NMR analytical technique is to
measure the change in energy levels of nuclei, as they are exposed to a strong magnetic
field.41 1H-NMR and

13

C-NMR are used to identify the organic substituents (e.g.,

methyl) that are bonded to the silicone backbone.29
GPC is another widely used analytical technique for analyzing silicone polymers. GPC
is also referred to as a SEC technique. The principle for the SEC analytical technique
is to separate compounds based on their size.42 Dissolved compounds are injected into
a column filled with a porous material. The smaller compounds move slowly through
the column because they are small enough to enter the pores, while the larger
compounds move quickly because they are too large to enter the pores. GPC coupled
with refractive index (RI) detection acquires information regarding the averages
molecular weight and the distribution of the silicone polymers. 29 GPC coupled with
laser angle scattering detection acquires information regarding three-dimensional
structure of the silicone polymers.
Characterization of PDMS can also be performed using SEC coupled with mass
spectroscopy (MS), with either electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix assisted laser
desorption ionization (MALDI).43 Both SEC-ESI-MS and SEC-MALDI-MS acquire
information regarding the molecular composition of the silicone polymers, which can
identify, for example, repeated units, end groups, or impurities. SEC coupled with
triple detection (i.e., light scattering detection, viscosity detection, and refractive index
detection) can also be used for PDMS characterization. SEC coupled with the triple
detection acquires information regarding the absolute molecular weights and
distribution of the silicone polymers. SEC can also be coupled with evaporative light
scattering detection (ELSD) for the characterization of PDMS. 44-48
Quantification of Si-compounds in, for example, silicone oils are also possible by
using ICP-OES.30 ICP-OES is a rather simple yet convenient analytical approach for
analysis of Si-compounds. The principle for the ICP-OES analytical technique is that
the analyte atoms are exposed to a plasma.49 Due to the plasma, the atoms are excited
to a higher energy level and returned to a lower energy level. As a result of the return,
the energy is released as emission rays, which are measured and used to identify the
30

Charlotte Holmberg

analyte. Other hyphenated methods with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are, for
example, ICP-MS30 or SEC-ICP-OES.35 The SEC-ICP-OES method is size exclusion
separation coupled with ICP-OES. The result of this combination is a separation of
high and low MW compounds and an outstanding determination of silicon distribution
in the sample.
Determination of Si-compounds in biological samples by using ETAAS have been
studied by Hornung and Krivan.36 The principle for ETAAS is to introduce the sample
into a heated tube of graphite.50 The detection is based on the amount of absorbed
radiation by free atoms.51
The ELSD coupled with SEC is the most universal detector available. 44 The principle
for the detection is to expose non-volatile with a scattered laser light. A study
performed by Mojsiewicz-Pienkowska44 determines the intensity of the signal when
alternating some parameters, while analyzing PDMS. The result from the study states
that a change in neither polymerization degree, viscosity, nor the molecular weight of
the PDMS will influence the signal intensity.
When operating with ELSD detector, the detection sensitivity can be controlled using
different types of “gain”.52 The setting for the gain on a Sedex 85LT detector is
available in a range of 1 to 12. An increase of the gain results in an increase of the
signal amplification (i.e., sensitivity of the detector). Increasing the gain by one (e.g.,
from gain 1 to gain 2) correlates in a twofold increase of the sensitivity. Sometimes,
the analyte of interest is not detected. In this case, there are some options for trying to
increase the sensitivity. One option is to decrease the temperature of the detector. This
could help increase the sensitivity as the thermal evaporation is decreased. Another
option is to use high quality solvent for mobile phase in order to decrease background
noise. Low sensitivity for the detection could also be a sign of dirty nebulizer. ELSD,
as a detector in combination with reversed phase liquid chromatography, achieves a
LOQ of 88 µg/ml for the detection of silicone oils.53

3 OBJECTIVES
This work was based on previously developed analytical procedures for SPE and acted
as a continuation of the thesis published by Kenneth Arandia in 2018.54 Most of the
experimental procedures of this work were similar to the procedures of the previously
mentioned thesis.
The objective of this work was to develop an improved analytical method for the
analysis of PDMS in bio-oil matrices. The goals of the experimental section were to
increase the yield of the elution of silicone oil, or PDMS, and to successfully separate
the PDMS from all other bio-oil components, during SPE. The reason for separating
the PDMS from the bio-oils was to collect and concentrate the PDMS from a spiked
bio-oil sample. The concentrated PDMS was analyzed and an attempt to increase the
detection (i.e., lower the detection limit) of PDMS by HP-SEC was performed.
The previously developed method for separation by SPE was working well for high
MW PDMS. The hypothesis tested in this work was whether the SPE-method
developed during this work was able to separate PDMS of different molecular weights
(i.e., high, medium, and low MW PDMS). The applicability of the newly developed
SPE-method in three different bio-oil matrices was also tested.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
4.1 Material and instruments
Kimax® borosilicate culture tubes of the size 16 x 100 mm were used for these
experiments, together with 15 mm screw caps. The sample vials for HP-SEC and
GC-FID analyses were FisherBrand autosampler 1.5 ml short thread vials of the size
32 x 11.6 mm. The caps for the autosampler vials were UltraClean closure 9 mm short
thread caps with silicone and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or with rubber and
PTFE.
The Eppendorf Multipipette® M4 together with combitips of the sizes 1–10 ml was
used for measuring solvents and samples. VWR Ergonomic High-Performance
micropipettes of the sizes 20–200 µl and 100–1 000 µl were used to measure small
amounts of solvents or reagents. A 500 µl Gastight® syringe was used to transfer the
samples to the autosampler vials. Syringe filters with a 0.2 µm PTFE membrane were
used together with the 500 µl syringe in order to remove any small particle. Unplugged
150 mm glass Pasteur pipettes were also used to transfer smaller volumes of samples
and SPE fractions.
SPE cartridges produced by different manufacturers were used for fractionation.
HyperSep florisil 1 000 mg, HyperSep florisil 2 000 mg, and HyperSep silica 1 000 mg
were all from Thermo Scientific (USA). A Chromabond® polares development kit
containing cartridges of the size 500 mg were also used. The Chromabond® kit
contained cartridges based on different materials: SiOH, florisil, OH (diol), CN, and
NH2. The SPE extraction manifold that was utilized was a Resprep™ 12-port vacuum
manifold.
The Pierce Model 18780 Reacti-Vap™ evaporating unit, together with a gas tank of
nitrogen (N2), was utilized to remove any solvent from the samples. A VWR
International vortex mixer was used when proper mixing of reagents was needed, such
as during silylation. A Memmert oven, set to 70 ℃, was used for heating of the samples
during silylation. To remove the last residues of solvents, a Heraeus vacuum desiccator
33

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

set to 40 ℃ was used. For the gravimetric measurements, a Mettler Toledo Excellence
Plus analytical balance was utilized.
The used instrument for HP-SEC analyses was a Shimadzu LC-10AT VP liquid
chromatograph. The liquid chromatograph was connected to a Sedex 85 SEDERE
LT-ELSD detector. During analyses, the detector was set to 40 ℃. Depending on the
concentration of the analyte of interest, the gain of the detector was set to either gain 3
or gain 6. Gain 3 was used for higher concentrations and gain 6 was used for lower
concentrations. The instrument was equipped with three columns: one guard column
and two actual separation columns. The guard column was a Jordi Gel DVB 500 Å
with the dimensions 50 x 7.8 mm. The separation columns were two identical Jordi
Gel DVB 500 Å with the dimensions 300 x 7.8 mm. The eluent utilized for HP-SEC
analysis was tetrahydrofuran (THF) of high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade with 1% (v/v) of filtered acetic acid.
For GC-FID analyses, both short column and long column were utilized. The
instruments were two separate Clarus® 500 gas chromatographs for each column. The
column used as short column was an Agilent J&W Megabore GC column with the
dimensions: 6.4 m in length, 0.53 mm as internal diameter, and 0.15 µm thickness of
the film. The column used as long column was a HP-1 Agilent Narrowbore GC column
with the dimensions: 25 m in length, 0.2 mm as internal diameter, and 0.11 µm
thickness of the film. The two rinse solutions used during GC-FID analyses were
ethanol and toluene.
The temperature during GC-FID analyses was following different programs whether
the short or long column was used. For both columns, there was one program for the
injector and one program for the oven. The injector program for the short column was
starting at 80 ℃, increasing first with 50 ℃/min until 110 ℃, and then increasing with
15 ℃/min until 330 ℃. The oven program for the short column was starting at 100 ℃
increasing with 12 ℃/min until 340 ℃. The injector program for the long column was
starting at 160 ℃ increasing with 8 ℃/min until 260 ℃. Two different oven programs
were used for the long column. One of the programs was starting at 60 ℃ increasing
with 8 ℃/min until 300 ℃ and the other program was starting at 120 ℃ increasing
with 6 ℃/min until 320 ℃.

The instrument utilized for GC-MS was of the HP 6890 series GC system. The
installed column was a capillary column of type HP-1 methyl siloxane Agilent
19091Z-002. The dimensions of the column were as follows: 25 m in length, 200 µm
in diameter, and 0.11 µm of the thickness of the film. The flow in the column was set
to be constant. The injection mode was set to splitless and helium was used as a carrier
gas. The initial temperature of the oven was 80 ℃. The final temperature was 320 ℃.

4.3 Experimental procedures
4.3.1

Preparation of stock solutions of PDMS model compounds

A beaker, a 250 ml volumetric flask, and a 250 ml storing flask was cleaned with
acetone and dried. The clean and dry beaker was used for silicone oil. Approximately
530 mg (533.65 mg) of high MW silicone oil (i.e., 1 000 cSt) was weighed into the
clean beaker and hexane was added to dissolve the silicone oil. The solution was
transferred to the clean 250 ml volumetric flask. The beaker was rinsed a couple of
times with pure hexane, which was then added to the volumetric flask. The solution in
the volumetric flask was diluted to the mark. In order to prepare a stock solution with
a concentration of 2 mg/ml, 533.65 mg requires 266.83 ml of hexane. The volumetric
flask was only able to hold 264 ml. The solution of 264 ml was therefore transferred
to the storing flask before the final 2.83 ml of hexane was added. In order to achieve
the most exact concentration, the volumetric flask was rinsed a couple of times with
the solution from the storing flask.
An analysis set, which consisted of different concentrations of high MW silicone oil
in hexane, was prepared by using the stock solution of silicone oil with a concentration
of 2 mg/ml. The stock solution was diluted nine times in total, resulting in
concentrations ranging from 1 mg/ml to 0.0015 mg/ml. The highest concentration in
the set (i.e., 1 mg/ml) was prepared with 15 ml of hexane and 15 ml of the stock
solution. Each new concentration after 1 mg/ml was three times less than the previous.
This was easily achieved by adding 10 ml of the higher concentration to 20 ml of
hexane. A summary of the concentrations of the analysis set is presented in Table 8.
One sample of each concentration was analyzed by HP-SEC, in order to verify the
practical detection limit.

Four 30 ml storing vials were cleaned with acetone and dried. The medium MW and
the low MW (i.e., 50 cSt and 5 cSt, respectively) model compounds for silicone oil
were weighed directly into two of the 30 ml storing vials. Approximately 49.8 mg of
the medium MW model compound and 121.3 mg of the low MW model compound
were weighed into separated storing vials. Hexane was added to both storing vials. The
final concentration was 2 mg/ml for the medium MW stock solution and 5 mg/ml for
the low MW stock solution. Stock solutions in hexane were also prepared for D3 and
D4 PDMS degradation products. D3 and D4 are cyclic oligomers containing three or
four repeating units of siloxanes, respectively. Approximately 220.6 mg of D3 PDMS
product and 251.1 mg of D4 PDMS product were weighed into the last two storing
vials. Hexane was added and the final concentration of both stock solutions was
10 mg/ml.

4.3.2

High performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC)

Samples for HP-SEC analysis were first placed in the evaporating unit with N 2 gas
purging at 50 ℃ in order to remove any residues of solvents. The dried samples were
dissolved in THF and mixed thoroughly. The ideal concentration of the solution for
HP-SEC is 1 mg/ml, and the minimum amount of THF that can be used is 0.5 ml.

38

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

One ml of each sample dissolved in THF was transferred by using a 500 µl syringe
into separate 1.5 ml glass autosampler vials. Before the samples were transferred to
the vials, they were filtered through a 0.2 µm PTFE filter. One ml of pure THF was
used as the blank sample, which was injected before all the samples were analyzed.
The blank sample would verify the noise in the baseline for each run.
The eluent for the HP-SEC run was prepared as a HPLC-grade THF solution with
1% v/v glacial acetic acid (i.e., 1 ml of filtered glacial acetic acid for each 100 ml of
THF). The rate of the flow was slowly increased, starting from 0.1 ml/min, and ending
at 0.8 ml/min. The parameters for the run were as follows: 50 µl injection volume,
0.8 ml/min isocratic flow, 28 min run-time, temperature of 40 ℃, and sensitivity of
either gain 3 or gain 6. Gain 3 was used when the concentration of the analyte of
interest was around 1 mg/ml. For concentrations lower than 1 mg/ml, gain 6 was used.

4.3.3

Gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID)

Samples for GC-FID analysis were taken as 1 ml of the HP-SEC samples dissolved in
THF. An internal standard with the concentration of 0.02 mg/ml was added to each
GC-FID sample with the volume of 2 ml. The internal standard was pre-prepared
betulinol. The pre-prepared 0.02 mg/ml internal standard cholesterol was also used in
some cases. Both betulinol and cholesterol contained four individual standards, which
were called acid 21:0, betulinol, CH17, and TG-standard. Every test tube with a sample
for GC-FID was placed in the evaporating unit with N2 gas purging at 50 ℃. After
complete removal of THF and MTBE, the test tubes were placed in the vacuum
desiccator at 40 ℃ for 20 minutes.
A mixture of the silylating reagents was prepared with one part of pyridine, four parts
of BSTFA, and one part of TMCS. As the BSTFA and TMCS are sensitive to moisture
and normally stored in the refrigerator, they were allowed to cool down to room
temperature before preparing the mixture. 150 µl of the mixture of the silylating
reagents was added to each sample. The samples were mixed using a vortex mixer
before they were placed in the oven at 70 ℃, with closed caps. After five minutes, the

39

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

samples were mixed a second time using a vortex mixer and placed back in the oven
for 40 minutes.
After a total of 45 minutes in the oven, the samples were mixed again by using a vortex
mixer and then they were allowed to cool down to room temperature. The samples
were transferred into a V-shaped glass insert inside a vial by using a Pasteur pipette.
A blank sample was also prepared, which consisted of only the silylating reagents. The
samples were analyzed with either short column GC-FID or long column GC-FID. The
same sample preparation was also performed for analysis with GC-MS.

4.3.4

Solvent extraction

A separation of the components in BO 1 was performed by solvent extraction between
two immiscible solvents: methanol and hexane. One set of borosilicate test tubes was
prepared by washing the tubes two times with 3 ml acetone. Two 50 ml volumetric
flasks were also prepared by washing them with acetone. The set of test tubes was
placed in a vacuum desiccator at 40 ℃ for 20 minutes. The volumetric flasks were
dried by allowing the acetone to evaporate in the oven at 70 ℃ for a couple of minutes.
Approximately 250 mg of BO 1 was weighed into each test tube. Four ml of both
methanol and hexane were added to each test tube. 100 µl of 25% ammonium
hydroxide was also added to the test tubes in order to make the separation of the acids
more efficient. The test tubes were mixed thoroughly by using a vortex mixer,
whereupon the immiscible solvents were allowed to separate naturally.
The hexane phase, which lies on the top, was transferred to one of the 50 ml volumetric
flasks by using a Pasteur pipette. The hexane phase from all the test tubes was
transferred to the same volumetric flask. Additionally, another 4 ml of hexane was
added to the test tubes for a second extraction. The second time, the test tubes were
mixed by hand, whereupon the solvents were allowed to separate naturally. The hexane
phases from the second extraction were also transferred to the same volumetric flask
as before. The hexane phases, in the volumetric flask, were diluted to the mark with
hexane. Two borosilicate test tubes were washed with acetone and dried in the vacuum
40

Master’s thesis

desiccator for 30 minutes. The clean and empty test tubes were weighed. One of the
test tubes was used as a blank, while 1 ml of the diluted hexane phase was added to
the other test tube. The hexane was evaporated from the sample by using the
evaporating unit with N2 gas purging at 50 ℃. After completed evaporation, the test
tubes were placed in the vacuum desiccator at 40 ℃ for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes,
the test tubes were weighed and placed back into the vacuum desiccator. The test tubes
were repeatedly weighed with a 15-minute interval.
Two other bio-oils (i.e., BO 2 and BO 3) were also fractionated with the same solvent
extraction as BO 1. Three selected real samples with BO 1 as matrix were also
fractionated with solvent extraction.

4.3.5

Solid-phase extraction (SPE)

The primary focus of the experimental section was the SPE. Several SPE fractionations
were performed, where the parameters were somewhat changed for each analysis. The
basics for every SPE fractionation were the same and are described below. Depending
on the size of the SPE cartridges, the total volume of one fraction was either 3 ml,
6 ml, or 12 ml, for 500 mg, 1 000 mg, and 2 000 mg cartridges, respectively.

The basic SPE procedure
The solvent combinations were based on the findings of Kenneth Arandia.54 Table 9
shows the primary solvent combinations used by Kenneth Arandia, which were also
used in this work. Each of the solvent combinations were prepared in 500 ml or 250 ml
flasks. The used SPE cartridges were placed onto the extraction manifold. Clean test
tubes were placed in the extraction manifold, underneath the cartridges for collection
of the eluting fractions. A vacuum system was connected to the extraction manifold,
as a slightly pressurized manifold is more efficient during the extraction.

The cartridges were conditioned with pure DCM followed by pure hexane, one fraction
of each solvent. Before the sample was loaded, the DCM and hexane from the
conditioning were emptied out from the test tubes. The samples of interest, already
dissolved in hexane, were loaded onto the cartridges. The first fraction from the solvent
combinations was loaded onto the cartridges and collected into the test tube. After each
fraction, the test tubes were changed to new ones, resulting in collection of one fraction
per test tube. Each fraction from the solvent combinations was loaded and collected.
Every fraction was evaporated by using the evaporating unit with N 2 gas purging at
50 ℃. The fractions were evaporated both separately and combined. The combined
fractions were usually combined according to the percentage of DCM in the eluent or
according to the elution of PDMS (i.e., all the fractions were PDMS was expected to
elute were combined into one sample for further analysis). Analysis of the SPE
fractions was performed by HP-SEC or GC-FID.

Tests of different solvents and cartridge materials
Since the experimental section of this work was a continuation of the experimental
work of Kenneth Arandia, the different SPE tests started where Arandia left off (i.e.,
using SiOH cartridges for SPE fractionation). The first tests in trying to improve the
elution of PDMS on SPE cartridges focused on the effects of different solvents and the
effect of different material of the cartridge. The solvents used for testing were DCM,
42

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

chloroform, EtAc, acetone, ethanol, THF, MTBE, and toluene. For every different
solvent tested, a HyperSep 1 000 mg SiOH cartridge was used. After conditioning with
6 ml of each DCM and hexane, 1.5 ml of pure high MW PDMS with a concentration
of 1 mg/ml in hexane was loaded onto the cartridges. One fraction of 6 ml hexane was
first eluted before the tested solvents were eluted.
The following SPE cartridges were compared to each other: SiOH, florisil, OH (diol),
CN and NH2. All these different cartridges were only 500 mg in size, and the
conditioning was performed with 3 ml of both DCM and hexane. For the smaller
cartridges, only 1 ml of the pure high MW PDMS sample with a concentration of
1 mg/ml in hexane was loaded onto the cartridges. DCM was used as eluent for every
cartridge and 10 ml of DCM was eluted and collected directly after loaded sample.

High MW PDMS in BO 1 matrix
The elution of a pure high MW PDMS and a pure BO 1 sample was tested on separate
Chromabond® CN and Chromabond® florisil SPE cartridges. The cartridges were only
500 mg in size and 3 ml of each fraction was used. The cartridges were conditioned
with 3 ml DCM and 3 ml hexane, whereupon 1 ml of pure PDMS (with a concentration
of 1 mg/ml in hexane) was added to one of the CN cartridges and one of the florisil
cartridges. To the other CN and florisil cartridge, 0.5 ml of the BO 1 sample (with a
concentration of 16.04 mg/ml in hexane) was added. Identical SPE elution and analysis
pre-treatment were performed for each cartridge. The solvent combinations in Table 9
were used. The eluted fractions were combined according to the concentration of
DCM, i.e., P2–P5 and P9–P10 were combined while the rest of the fractions were
separately analyzed. HP-SEC analysis of the fractions dissolved in THF was
performed with gain 3.
The elution of a spiked BO 1 sample was studied using a Chromabond® florisil
cartridge. The BO 1 sample was spiked with high MW PDMS and the final
concentration of PDMS in the spiked sample was 0.33 mg PDMS per ml
hexane-soluble BO 1. One 500 mg florisil cartridge was conditioned and 1 ml of the
spiked sample was added to the cartridge. The primary solvent combinations (Table 9)
were used. The eluted fractions were combined according to an estimation where the
43

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

PDMS would elute, i.e., fractions P1–P6 and P7–P10 were combined. HP-SEC
analysis of the fractions dissolved in THF was performed with gain 6.

Comparison between different solvent combinations
A comparison between the primary solvent combinations and an alternative solvent
combination scheme was performed for the elution of a spiked BO 1 sample, using
two Chromabond® florisil cartridges. The alternative solvent combination scheme also
used DCM in hexane, however, it focused more on slowly increasing the polarity
between 12.5% DCM and 40% DCM. Table 10 shows the complete scheme of the
solvent combinations. A spiked BO 1 sample with a final concentration of 1 mg PDMS
per ml hexane-soluble BO 1 was used. The 500 mg florisil cartridges were conditioned
and 0.1 ml of the spiked sample was added to both cartridges. One of the cartridges
was eluting the sample using the primary solvent combinations (Table 9) and the other
cartridge was using the alternative solvent combinations (Table 10). Each fraction was
dissolved separately in THF and analyzed with HP-SEC gain 6.

fractionation.

Another comparison between the primary solvent combinations and the alternative

combinations were also compared between florisil and SiOH cartridges. HyperSep
44

Charlotte Holmberg

florisil and HyperSep SiOH, both 1 000 mg, cartridges were used. The cartridges were
conditioned and only 0.2 ml of a spiked BO 1 sample with the concentration of 1 mg
PDMS per ml spiked sample was added to each cartridge. Each of the eluted fraction
was dissolved in 1 ml THF before HP-SEC analysis with gain 6.

Test of cartridge overload
A test of the ability of the cartridge to resist overload was also studied. A comparison
was performed between HyperSep florisil cartridge and HyperSep SiOH cartridge. The
overload was studied by increasing the sample volume loaded onto the cartridge. The
sample used was a spiked BO 1 sample. However, the amount of the PDMS loaded
onto the cartridge was kept constant while both the amount of BO 1 components and
the sample volume was increased. The constant amount of the PDMS loaded onto the
cartridge was 0.2 mg. The tested sample volumes were 0.2 ml, 0.4 ml, 0.8 ml, 1.0 ml,
1.1 ml, and 1.5 ml. The same spiked samples and sample volume were added to both
florisil and SiOH cartridges. The solvent combinations used during this test were
according to a simplified version of the alternative solvent combinations (Table 11).
For each sample volume, the eluted fractions were combined as S1–S4 and S5–S8.
The combined fractions were dissolved in 1 ml THF and analyzed with HP-SEC
gain 6.

High MW PDMS in BO 2 and BO 3 matrices
The high MW PDMS model compound was also used to spike other matrices than
BO 1. The other matrices tested were BO 2 and BO 3. High MW PDMS was used to
spike the hexane-soluble fractions of both BO 2 and BO 3. The final spiked samples
consisted of 20% PDMS and 80% BO 2 or BO 3. The separation of PDMS from BO 2
or BO 3 was then tested with HyperSep florisil cartridges. Normal conditioning was
used and only 0.2 ml of the spiked sample was added to separate cartridges. The
alternative solvent combinations from Table 10 were used. Each eluted fraction was
separately dissolved in 1 ml THF and analyzed with HP-SEC gain 6.

Pure medium and low MW PDMS
Pure PDMS model compounds of both medium and low MW were also fractionated
through SPE cartridges. The concentration of both PDMS model compounds was
1 mg/ml in hexane. Both PDMS model compounds were fractionated through one
HyperSep florisil and one HyperSep SiOH cartridge. Normal conditioning was used
and 1 ml of each PDMS model compound was added to each cartridge. The simplified
solvent combinations (Table 11) were used for the elution. Each of the medium MW
PDMS eluted fractions was dissolved in 1 ml THF and analyzed with HP-SEC gain 3.
Two ml of the internal standard betulinol was added to each of the low MW PDMS
eluted fractions, which were then evaporated and silylated. The silylated low MW
PDMS fractions were analyzed with short column GC-FID.

Medium and low MW PDMS in BO 1, BO 2, and BO 3 matrices
The BO 1, BO 2 and BO 3 matrices were also spiked with both medium MW PDMS
and low MW PDMS, separately, before SPE fractionation. The final spiked samples
contained 20% medium or low MW PDMS and 80% of the respective matrix material.
All the spiked samples were fractionated through HyperSep florisil cartridges. Normal
conditioning was used and only 0.2 ml of each spiked sample was added to each
cartridge. The simplified solvent combinations in Table 11 were used. Each of the
medium MW PDMS eluted fractions in BO 1 matrix was dissolved in 1 ml THF and
analyzed with HP-SEC gain 6. The medium MW PDMS eluting fractions in BO matrix
were dissolved in 1.9 ml THF, and in the BO 3 matrix the fractions were dissolved in
46

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

1.6 ml THF. This was performed in order to obtain quite similar concentrations of
PDMS in THF for all three matrices. Two ml of the internal standard cholesterol or
betulinol was added to each of the low MW PDMS eluted fractions, which were then
evaporated and silylated. The silylated low MW PDMS fractions were analyzed with
short column GC-FID.

Pure D3 and D4 PDMS degradation products
The SPE fractionation of pure D3 and D4 PDMS degradation products was also studied.
The pure D3 and D4 PDMS products dissolved in hexane were fractionated through
both HyperSep florisil and SiOH cartridges. Normal conditioning was used and 2 mg
of each PDMS product was added onto each cartridge, which represented a volume of
1 ml as the concentration of the PDMS product samples was 2 mg/ml. The simplified
solvent combinations in Table 11 were used. For each of the 6 ml collected fractions,
only 150 µl was directly analyzed with long column GC-FID. Since the D3 and D4
PDMS products are highly volatile, they were analyzed without any pre-treatment.

D3 and D4 in BO 1 matrix
The D3 and D4 PDMS product were also spiked in BO 1 matrix and fractionated with
SPE. The final spiked samples contained 20% of the D3 or D4 product and 80% of the
BO 1 matrix. The samples were only fractionated through HyperSep florisil cartridges.
Normal conditioning was used, and 0.2 ml of the spiked samples was loaded onto each
cartridge. The simplified solvent combinations from Table 11 were used. For each of
the 6 ml fractions, only 150 µl was directly analyzed with long column GC-FID. Since
the D3 and D4 PDMS products are highly volatile, the samples were analyzed without
any pre-treatment.

Real unspiked BO 1 samples
Three of the real samples were chosen to be fractionated using the newly developed
SPE method, in order to compare it with the previously developed SPE method. The
newly developed SPE method consists of florisil cartridge and the simplified solvent
combinations (Table 11). The three chosen real samples consisted of a high, medium,
and low approximate concentration of PDMS, respectively. The concentrations had
47

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

previously been estimated by Arandia based on a calibration curve. The estimated
PDMS concentrations were 72 ppm, 44 ppm, and 21 ppm. For each of the samples,
three parallel SPE fractionations were performed with HyperSep florisil 2 000 mg
cartridge. Normal conditioning was used and only 0.4 ml of the hexane-soluble
fraction of each real sample was added to each florisil cartridge. The eluted fractions
for each of the samples were combined as S1–S4 and S5–S8 in pre-weighed test tubes.
The combined fractions for each sample were weighed and dissolved in only 0.5 ml
THF before HP-SEC analysis with gain 6. Table 12 shows the weights of the different
PDMS-eluting fractions (i.e., S5–S8) and the concentration of the fractions dissolved
in THF.

Realistically spiked BO 1 samples
The BO 1 was also spiked with more realistic amount of high MW PDMS. This meant
spiked samples with the concentration of PDMS as follows: 700 ppm, 450 ppm,
300 ppm, 150 ppm, 75 ppm, 50 ppm, and 25 ppm. Each of the spiked samples was
fractionated through three parallel HyperSep florisil 2 000 mg cartridges. Normal
conditioning was used and the sample load for each of the cartridges was 0.4 ml. The
simplified solvent combinations and 12 ml of each fraction were used during the
fractionation. The eluted fractions were combined as S5–S8 as they were evaporated.
The combined fractions were dissolved in 0.5 ml THF and HP-SEC analysis with
gain 6 was performed.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5.1 High performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC)
The detection of pure high MW PDMS occurred at a retention time (RT) between
13 min and 17 min. Evidently, the detection was strongly dependent on the
concentration of the analyte in the sample. The analysis set with different
concentrations (Table 8) was analyzed with HP-SEC-ELSD using both gain 3 and
gain 6. Detection with gain 3 was possible for concentrations above 0.11 mg/ml, which
is illustrated in Figure 9. However, for concentrations below 0.11 mg/ml, gain 3 was
not sensitive enough and gain 6 was rather used in those cases. Figure 10 illustrates
the detection of the PDMS concentrations below 0.11 mg/ml. With gain 6, the lowest
detectable concentration of PDMS was 0.0041 mg/ml in THF. For concentrations
below 0.0041 mg/ml see appendix A Figure A1. The practical detection limit for this
analysis was established to be 0.004 mg/ml of pure high MW PDMS in THF.

The detection of the pure medium MW PDMS model compound is illustrated in

was obtained. The detection of pure medium MW PDMS occurred at RT 14–19 min.
The higher retention time, compared to the retention time of high MW PDMS,
confirmed the sample consisted of smaller molecules. The detection of pure medium
MW PDMS with HP-SEC works as a reference material of the retention time of the
material.

5.2 Gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID)
The GC-FID was used as an analytical method for the more volatile components (i.e.,
low MW PDMS, D3 and D4 PDMS degradation products). Pure samples dissolved in
hexane of each of the volatile component were analyzed in order to receive reference
material of the retention times of the components. Figure 12 illustrates the GC-FID
chromatogram of the pure low MW PDMS model compound. The low MW PDMS
model compound consisted of differently sized small and short siloxanes. In the
chromatogram (Figure 12), these siloxanes are numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Only the
five first PDMS peaks are numbered, though the numbering continues for every
continuously repeated peak. The peak areas are summarized in appendix B (Table B1),
where both the separate peak areas and the total peak area of the low MW PDMS are
available.

Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the detection of the highly volatile D3 and D4 PDMS

impurities were most likely from one of the solvents. The RT for each of the solvents
was at 0.8 min for ethanol, at 1.0 min for hexane, and at 1.3 min for toluene. The RT
for D3 was at about 1.6 min and for D4 at about 3.25 min. The peak areas of D3 and D4
are available in appendix B (Table B2), where also the concentration of the used
samples is mentioned.

5.3 Solvent extraction
Five different BO 1 samples were fractionated by solvent extraction, of which two
were fractionated two times. Solvent extraction was also performed one time on a
BO 2 sample and a BO 3 sample. After each performed solvent extraction, the
concentration of the hexane phase was determined gravimetrically. The
gravimetrically determined concentration gave a relative mass distribution of the
matrix material between the two phases. The amount of extracted BO 1 material in the
hexane phase varied between 53.5% and 79.4% and the extracted BO 1 material in the
methanol phase varied between 20.6% and 46.1%. The same mass distribution
percentages for the BO 2 and the BO 3 samples varied slightly from the BO 1 samples.
This was mainly due to the difference in the chemical composition between the three
different samples. Figure 15 illustrates the mass distribution of the extracted phases.
The gravimetrically determined concentrations of the extracted phases are summarized
in Table 13.

Sample

HP-SEC-ELSD analysis of the extracted phases (i.e., hexane and methanol) was
performed in order to confirm the composition of each fraction. An unfractionated
BO 1 sample contained steryl ester, fatty acids, and resin acids, which is illustrated in
Figure 16. During solvent extraction, the steryl esters rather stayed in the hexane
phase, while the fatty acids and the resin acids stayed in the methanol phase. Figures 17
and 18 illustrate the HP-SEC chromatograms of each extracted phase. When
comparing the different BO 1 samples, both unfractionated and the extracted fractions,
it is clearly visible how all the samples contained different amounts of each
component. However, the separation of the steryl esters from the fatty and resin acids
was successfully performed for all the samples.

Since the BO 2 and the BO 3 samples did not contain much of the same components
as BO 1, close to 100% of the material was more likely to be soluble in the hexane
phase. The BO 2 and the BO 3 unfractionated samples contained mostly of glycerides
together with a small amount of fatty acids. During solvent extraction, the glycerides
stayed in the hexane phase, while the fatty acids stayed in the methanol phase.

Tests of different solvents and cartridge materials

Each of the tested solvents was eluted with a 10 ml volume of the solvent. Only some
selected solvents were eluted a second time with a 20 ml volume of the solvent. The
comparison between a 10 ml and 20 ml volume of the solvent is illustrated in
Figure 21, where toluene was used. It is clearly shown that a higher volume of the
eluent solvent eluted slightly more of the pure high MW PDMS and the conclusion
that all the tested solvents would have behaved in that similar way was made.

Among all the tested solvents, DCM, toluene, and chloroform resulted in the best
elution of pure high MW PDMS. However, the yield of the eluted high MW PDMS
was not exceeding 50% for any of the solvents. The second-best elution of the high
MW PDMS was achieved with MTBE, EtAc, and THF. Acetone and ethanol did not
elute high MW PDMS very well. Figure 22 illustrates the elution of high MW PDMS

one of the next tests, which resulted in various outcomes. The cartridge with CN
material was the only cartridge resulting in 100% yield in the elution of pure high MW
PDMS. The cartridge with florisil material showed second-best elution, about 80%
yield. SiOH cartridge compared to CN or florisil cartridges was eluting the high MW
PDMS in a much lower yield, almost about 50%. Figure 23 illustrates the elution of
the pure high MW PDMS on the different SPE cartridges tested. The conclusion from
the different cartridge material test is that CN cartridge was a good option, and it was
used in further tests.

High MW PDMS in BO 1 matrix

As the CN cartridge was shown to be the best option regarding the yield of the eluted
high MW PDMS, the elution of both pure high MW PDMS and pure BO 1 material
was studied on separate cartridges. With the primary solvent combinations used
(Table 9), the pure high MW PDMS eluted already in the first fraction. For the same
solvent combinations, most of the BO 1 components eluted also in the first fraction.
Some of the BO 1 material was also present in the next fractions, the combined P2–
P5. Figure 24 illustrates the separate elution of the two studied materials. The
conclusion drawn from these results is that a BO 1 sample spiked with high MW
PDMS would also give the same results (i.e., elution of the high MW PDMS and the
BO 1 material in the same fractions). As a good separation of the high MW PDMS
from the BO 1 material was the goal for the SPE, the CN cartridge would not work

61

sufficiently enough and tests using the CN cartridges were therefore discontinued.
Further tests were focusing on using the second-best SPE cartridge (i.e., florisil).

The elution of pure high MW PDMS and the elution of pure BO 1 on separate
cartridges were repeated, using the florisil cartridge instead of the CN cartridge. With
the florisil cartridge, the elution of the pure high MW PDMS was more spread out
between several fractions. However, the eluted pure high MW PDMS was
concentrated to the last fractions, P8–P10, which was a promising improvement
compared to the CN cartridge. The elution of the pure BO 1 material was, also for the
florisil cartridge, concentrated to the first fractions, P1–P5. Figure 25 illustrates a
comparison between the fractions, where most of the pure high MW PDMS and the
pure BO 1 were eluting.

Comparing the elution of a BO 1 sample spiked with high MW PDMS with the
previous results (Figure 25) provided some unexpected information. The elution of
high MW PDMS, together with BO 1 on the same cartridge, shifted from the later
fractions to the earlier fractions. All the high MW PDMS and the BO 1 eluted in the
same fractions, which was not an improvement. These results were insinuating there
was an overload of the cartridge occurring. Figure 26 illustrates the eluted fractions
for the spiked BO 1 sample.

5.4.3

Comparison between different solvent combinations

A decrease in the loaded sample volume was studied along with a change in the used
solvent combinations, in order to avoid overload. A comparison was then performed,
where the primary solvent combinations in Table 9 were compared with an alternative
version (Table 10). Figures 27 and 28 illustrate the results from the SPE fractionation
on florisil cartridges. The fractions shown in Figures 27 and 28 are the same (i.e., E7–
E9) in order to show how different the elution of both the high MW PDMS and the
BO 1 were for the two different solvent combinations.
A better picture of which solvent combination that resulted in an improved separation
was achieved by comparing the peak areas of all the fractions where some high MW
PDMS was eluting. The peak areas of eluted high MW PDMS and BO 1 (Table C1
and C2 in appendix C) revealed that there was more of the high MW PDMS in total
eluting with the primary solvent combinations. However, the total amount of eluted
64

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

BO 1 material was less for the alternative solvent combinations. This showed that even
though the elution of high MW PDMS was more spread out for the alternative solvent
combinations, it was possible to concentrate the high MW PDMS since less BO 1 was
eluting in the same fractions.

Spiked BO 1 sample

The elution of a spiked BO 1 sample when comparing the SPE florisil cartridge and
the SiOH cartridge is illustrated in Figure 29. Figure 29 illustrates the fraction where
most of the high MW PDMS was eluting (i.e., fraction A7 for both cartridges). From
the chromatogram, it is clearly visible that both cartridges had quite similar ability to
elute the high MW PDMS. However, the florisil cartridge seemed to be adsorbing the
BO 1 material better than the SiOH cartridge.
A comparison can also be made between the peak areas for the different fractions from
the florisil and the SiOH cartridge. When comparing the peak areas of the eluted high
MW PDMS with the peak areas of the BO 1 in the same fractions where high MW
PDMS was eluting, there was clearly less BO 1 together with the high MW PDMS for

66

the florisil cartridge. In this sense, the florisil cartridge resulted in a slightly better
separation. The peak areas are available in appendix C, Table C3 and C4.

Test of cartridge overload

A summary of the concentration of high MW PDMS in each spiked sample is available
in appendix D (Table D1). The HyperSep florisil cartridge started showing overload
already with 0.4 ml sample loaded onto the cartridge. For each volume between 0.4 ml
and 1.5 ml, the elution of high MW PDMS was completely shifted from the later
fractions to the earlier fractions, showing clear overload. Figure 30 illustrates the
shifted elution of high MW PDMS for the highest sample volume loaded (i.e., 1.5 ml).

The HyperSep SiOH cartridge, however, had a higher ability to resist overload. For all

Only for the highest sample volume (i.e., 1.5 ml), there were some signs of a small
overload, when some high MW PDMS also eluted in the earlier fractions. Figure 31
illustrates the eluted fractions for the highest sample volume (i.e., 1.5 ml) loaded onto

High MW PDMS in BO 2 and BO 3 matrices

Tests using BO 2 and BO 3 as matrices were also performed, in order to compare the
behavior of the elution of the high MW PDMS in the three different matrices. The
elution of high MW PDMS in a matrix of BO 2 seemed to begin much earlier than in
a matrix of BO 1. This earlier elution was also the result in a matrix of BO 3. Though
the elution of high MW PDMS was occurring much sooner, the elution for the
BO 2/BO 3 components was occurring much later than for the BO 1 components.
Figure 32 illustrates the fractions for the BO 2 sample where most of the high MW
PDMS was eluting and where most of the BO 2 components were eluting (i.e., A5–
A10). Figure 33 illustrates the same fractions but for the BO 3 sample. In Figures 32
and 33, it is visible how the elution of the matrix components was increasing in the
later fractions, starting from fraction A7.

Pure medium MW PDMS

The developed florisil SPE method was also applied to the medium MW PDMS, to
record the compatibility of the SPE method. The pure medium MW PDMS model
compound was separated by SPE in order to receive a reference material. The SPE
fractionation was performed as a comparison between the florisil cartridge and the
SiOH cartridge, and the simplified solvent combinations (Table 11) were used for both
cartridges. The results from the HP-SEC analysis of the eluted fractions showed a clear
separation by molecular size between the different fractions. Figures 34 and 35
illustrate the HP-SEC chromatograms of the florisil and SiOH cartridge, respectively.
Both cartridges behaved in the same way, which was that the non-polar fractions were
eluting smaller molecules compared to the more polar fractions, which were eluting
larger molecules. The difference between the medium and high MW PDMS was that
the medium MW PDMS eluted already in the earliest fractions (i.e., S2–S6), while the
high MW PDMS was eluting in the later fractions.

The molecular weight distribution of the eluted fractions in Figures 34 and 35 was also
calculated. Based on the calculations of the molecular weight distribution, the average
molecular weight of the pure medium MW model compound before SPE was
determined to be 6 500. According to the manufacturer, this value should be 3 780.
The reason for the difference in the molecular weight was due to the calibration used
for the calculations. In this case, the molecular weight of the eluted medium MW
PDMS was compared against a calibration of polystyrene (PS), and the results were
therefore more general. Although the results were not completely accurate, it is still
seen from Figures 36 and 37 that the average molecular weight of the eluted fractions
was increasing with increasing polarity of the solvent. The average molecular weight
of these fractions is also illustrated in appendix E (Figures E1 and E2) as an integral
molecular weight curve.

Medium MW PDMS in BO 1 matrix

The same behavior of the medium MW PDMS was also visible together with BO 1.
That is, the fractions were eluting different sized molecules, and that the molecular
size was increasing with increasing polarity. Figure 38 illustrates the chromatogram of
the eluted fractions. Since the average molecular size of the medium MW PDMS was
smaller than for the high MW PDMS, there was some overlapping of the PDMS peak
with the BO 1 peak. The elution of the medium MW PDMS was still in the earliest
fractions even together with BO 1 as matrix. The tendency of the increasing molecular
size with increasing polarity was seen for the fractions S2–S6.

The elution of medium MW PDMS was also studied in the BO 2 and the BO 3 matrices
in order to compare the results with the BO 1 matrix. The same tendency of the
fractionation was also clearly visible for both the BO 2 and BO 3 matrices. The clear
difference between the BO 2 or the BO 3 matrix and the BO 1 matrix was that the
components of BO 2 and BO 3 were eluting mainly in the later fractions. There was
not much of the components of the matrix present in the PDMS eluting fractions. The

5.4.10 Pure low MW PDMS
Like the medium MW PDMS, the low MW PDMS also eluted in the earliest fraction.
For low MW PDMS, the elution was more concentrated to only fraction S1 and S2.
When comparing the different cartridges with each other, there were some differences.
The florisil cartridge was separating the elution of the PDMS between both fraction
S1 and S2, while the SiOH cartridge was eluting mostly in fraction S2, although there
was also some minimal amount of eluted PDMS in fraction S1 and S3. Figure 44
illustrates the PDMS eluting fractions for the florisil cartridge, and Figure 45 illustrates
the fraction with the most eluted PDMS for the SiOH cartridge.
For both chromatograms (Figures 44 and 45), the PDMS peaks are numbered as 1, 2,
3, 4, etc. Only the five first PDMS peaks are numbered, though the numbering
continues for every continuously repeated peak. The peak areas are summarized in
appendix B (Table B3), where both the separate peak areas and the total peak area of
the low MW PDMS are available. Differences in the total peak area for the low Mw

PDMS without SPE and post-SPE were due to the sample work-up. The low MW
PDMS was slightly volatile and some of it might have evaporated from the sample

5.4.11 Low MW PDMS in BO 1 matrix
The elution of low MW PDMS in a spiked BO 1 sample was quite similar to the elution
of pure low MW PDMS (i.e., most PDMS eluted in fractions S1 and S2). However,
the separation from the BO 1 components, on the florisil cartridge, was not quite
optimal in the case for the spiked sample. The short column GC-FID method for the
detection of PDMS was although a well-working analytical approach. The
chromatogram of the PDMS eluting fractions and the unfractionated spiked sample is
illustrated in Figure 46.

5.4.12 Low MW PDMS in BO 2 and BO 3 matrices
The elution of low MW PDMS and the separation from the components of the matrix
were also tested for spiked BO 2 and BO 3 samples. The elution of low MW PDMS
was still the same as in BO 1 matrix (i.e., most was elution in S1 and S2). The
separation of the PDMS from the BO 2 matrix on the florisil cartridge worked very
well, however, for the BO 3 matrix there were some components of BO 3 present in
the PDMS eluting fractions. The chromatograms of the spiked BO 2 and BO 3
fractions are illustrated in Figures 47 and 48, respectively. From the chromatograms,
it is visible that the components of the matrix were not present for BO 2 at RT 20–
22 min, which is the opposite of BO 3. The irregular peaks in both chromatograms
(Figures 47 and 48) at RT 4–7 min were identified by GC-MS to be methyl esters and
ethyl esters, which most likely were derived from the components of the matrix. The
GC-MS chromatograms, which were identifying the methyl and ethyl esters in the

5.4.13 Pure D3 and D4 PDMS oligomers
For D3 fractionated on the florisil cartridge (Figure 49), the elution was divided
between fraction S1 and S2. For D3 fractionated on the SiOH cartridge (Figure 50),
the elution was concentrated only to S2. This was the same behavior as the low MW
PDMS model compound. The elution of D4 on the florisil and the SiOH cartridge was
like the elution of D3. Figures 51 and 52 illustrate the elution of D4 on the florisil and
the SiOH cartridge, respectively. The peak areas of D3 and D4 on both the florisil and
the SiOH cartridge are summarized in appendix B (Table B4).

5.4.14 D3 and D4 PDMS oligomers in BO 1 matrix
The elution of the degradation products D3 and D4, respectively, in a spiked BO 1
sample was also studied. The theory before the test was that it might be possible to
separate the D3 and D4 products completely from the BO 1 matrix. A successful
separation of both D3 and D4 from the BO 1 matrix was obtained. The chromatograms
of the D3 and D4 are illustrated in Figures 53 and 54, respectively. The D3 and D4
products were eluting in fractions S1 and S2. These fractions were, however, not
completely free of BO 1 material. At RT 16–20 min, fractions S1 and S2 of both spiked
samples contained very small amounts of BO 1 components. Nevertheless, these BO 1
components were such a small amount that they were neglected. The peak areas of D3
and D4 in the spiked sample are summarized in appendix B (Table B5).

5.4.15 Real unspiked BO 1 samples
The HP-SEC results of the real samples (i.e., unspiked BO 1 samples) are illustrated
in Figure 55. The approximate concentrations of PDMS in the real samples were as
follows: high concentration for BO 1 (3), medium concentration for BO 1 (4), and low
concentration for BO 1 (5). A comparison of only the peaks of the PDMS in the
chromatogram revealed that the BO 1 (5) sample had a considerably lower
concentration of PDMS present, which would correspond to the approximate
concentration values. The BO 1 (3) and BO 1 (4) samples, however, seemed to have
quite similar concentrations of PDMS.

simplified solvent combinations, with focus on the elution of the PDMS. Sample
concentration in THF varies between 3.0–3.89 mg/ml. Gain 6 simplified solvent
combinations were used.
A comparison between the alternative SPE method and the previously developed
method showed some differences. For the alternative SPE method, the BO 1
components had a longer retention time. This was a sign that the florisil cartridge could
retain the BO 1 material better than the SiOH cartridge. Another clear difference
between the two methods was that the peak for the PDMS was slightly more defined
with the alternative SPE method. Figure 56 illustrates the results from the previously
developed SPE method (i.e., SiOH cartridge with the primary solvent combinations
from Table 9).
One important thing to remember when comparing the results is that the final
concentration of the samples in THF was different. The concentration of the samples
in THF for the previously developed method was the same for all the samples:
5 mg/ml. For the alternative method, the concentration of the samples in THF varied
between 3.0 mg/ml and 3.89 mg/ml. One other slight difference was the sample load.

5.4.16 Realistically spiked BO 1 samples
An attempt to determine the LOD and LOQ for the florisil SPE method was performed
by fractionating a set of spiked BO 1 samples. The samples were spiked with realistic
amounts of high MW PDMS. The sample with 75 ppm of spiked PDMS became
contaminated during work-up and was therefore not included here. Figure 57
illustrates the chromatogram of the spiked samples. Comparing appearance of all the
samples in the same HP-SEC chromatogram, showed a good differentiation between
the four highest spiked samples (i.e., 700–150 ppm). The difference among the
samples with 150–25 ppm of spiked PDMS was not very clear. It seemed the samples

89

were all on the same level, which was quite unexpected since they were spiked with
different amounts of PDMS.

In equations 1 and 2, σ is the standard deviation of the residuals and S is the slope of

37 ppm and the LOQ was determined to be 113 ppm. The LOD and LOQ were
calculated for the monomer of the PDMS. The values of LOD and LOQ would have
been more accurate if there were more data points available. In that sense, the LOD
and LOQ were not completely precise and the calculated values here were therefore
more indicative. The lowest spiked samples (i.e., 25 ppm and 50 ppm) showed to be
inconsistent compared to the rest of the spiked samples (Figure 58) and were therefore
not included in the calculations for the LOD and LOQ.

A final comparison of the elution of each type of PDMS in each fraction is summarized
in appendix H, Table H1. The information in the table consists of the different fractions
(i.e., percentage of DCM in hexane), the matrix used during the fractionation, and the
material of the used cartridge.

5.5 Florisil SPE method versus SiOH SPE method
Herein follows a rough comparison between the florisil SPE method (FL-SPE)
developed during this work and the SiOH SPE method (SI-SPE) developed during the
work of Kenneth Arandia.54 The first thing to notice is that the solvent combinations
of hexane and DCM worked well for both the florisil and the SiOH cartridges. The
solvent combinations allowed for a relatively good separation of the PDMS from the
BO 1 matrix material, however, complete absent of BO 1 matrix material was not
achieved.
The main difference between FL-SPE and SI-SPE was the sample volume that could
be loaded onto the cartridges. With the same sized cartridges (e.g., 1 000 mg), the
SiOH had the capacity to fractionate 1.5 ml sample, while the florisil only could
fractionate 0.2 ml sample before overload was observed. The lower sample volume
made combined parallel fractionations much more important, in order to reach up to
the same total sample volume loaded onto both cartridges.
It seemed though like the combined parallel fractionations resulted in a more defined
isolation of the PDMS, as for the case with the real unspiked BO 1 samples. With the
combined parallel fractionations, it also seemed like more BO 1 matrix material was
absorbed onto the florisil cartridge compared to a single sample load onto the SiOH
cartridge. Instead of using parallel cartridges, another alternative could be to use one
florisil cartridge of a much bigger size compared to the SiOH cartridge.
The determined values for the LOD and LOQ for both FL-SPE and SI-SPE were quite
similar. The LOD and LOQ for SI-SPE were 30 ppm and 92 ppm, respectively. The
same values for FL-SPE were 37 ppm and 113 ppm, respectively. The similar values
would indicate that the methods are quite comparable. However, the values for FL-SPE
92

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

are not to be completely trusted, as they were determined only based on four data
points. In order to receive more accurate values of the LOD and LOQ for FL-SPE, it
is advised to obtain more data points.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The previously developed analytical procedures for concentration of high MW PDMS
from the BO 1 matrix by SPE were further studied in order to find an improved
procedure. The focus was the isolation of high MW PDMS from the BO 1 matrix and
an alternative analytical procedure for this purpose was developed based on using
florisil SPE cartridges. However, the separation of medium and low MW PDMS from
the BO 1 matrix was also tested with the newly developed FL-SPE. The BO 1 samples
were also spiked with D3 and D4 PDMS degradation products and an attempt to isolate
D3 and D4 PDMS products was performed. The matrices BO 2 and BO 3 were also
studied with FL-SPE and compared to the performance of the BO 1 matrix. The
detection of high MW and medium MW PDMS was achieved by HP-SEC-ELSD. The
detection of low MW PDMS was possible through GC-FID.
Prior to any SPE fractionation, the matrices were fractionated by solvent extraction
between methanol and hexane. The fraction of interest was the hexane-soluble
fraction. The gravimetric content of the hexane-soluble fraction for the BO 1 samples
varied between 54% and 79%. The gravimetric content of the hexane-soluble fraction
of BO 2 and BO 3 was more than 85%. This difference is due to the different
compositions of the three bio-oils. BO 1 consisted of steryl esters, fatty acids, and resin
acids, while BO 2 and BO 3 consisted mostly of triglycerides and small amounts of
diglycerides and fatty acids.
The SPE tests were many and varied somewhat between each other. DCM was proved
to be the best alternative for solvent, when comparing different solvents (i.e., DCM,
chloroform, EtAc, acetone, ethanol, THF, MTBE, and toluene). Comparing different
material of the SPE cartridge (i.e., CN, florisil, OH as diol, NH2, and SiOH), proved
CN to be the best alternative. However, that applied only for pure PDMS and the
conclusion was made that the CN cartridge would not separate PDMS from BO 1 at
all. The SPE tests continued then with the florisil SPE cartridge.
For many of the experiments, the florisil cartridge was compared with the SiOH
cartridge. One example was when trying an alternative solvent combination for the
SPE fractionation. The elution of the high MW PDMS seemed to be quite similar with
94

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

both the florisil and the SiOH cartridge. There was, however, a difference in the elution
of the BO 1 matrix material. For the florisil cartridge, the PDMS could be more
concentrated since there was not as much of the BO 1 matrix that was eluting compared
to the SiOH cartridge. This could be a sign that the florisil cartridge could retain the
BO 1 matrix better than the SiOH cartridge. Another example was the effect of sample
overload. The SiOH cartridge (1 000 mg) was able to handle 1.5 ml sample load
without signs of overload. The florisil cartridge (1 000 mg), however, showed signs of
overload already with a 0.4 ml sample volume. The highest sample load without
overload for the florisil cartridge was then determined to be 0.2 ml. One conclusion of
this is that single cartridges of the same size do not fractionate the same volume of
sample. To resolve this problem, the fractionation through the florisil cartridge could
instead be performed by using parallel cartridges or by using one single cartridge of a
much bigger size.
The established florisil SPE method was also applied to spiked BO 1 samples with
medium MW and low MW PDMS. The medium MW PDMS was nicely separated
based on the molecular sizes, with all collected fractions containing differently sized
PDMS molecules. Comparing the florisil and the SiOH cartridge in the ability to
separate the pure medium MW PDMS molecules, revealed that the SiOH cartridge
separated the differently sized molecules slightly better than the florisil cartridge.
Spiked BO 2 and BO 3 with medium MW PDMS showed the same tendency of the
differently sized PDMS molecules nicely separated. The low MW PDMS was also
spiked in all three matrices. The isolation of the PDMS from BO 2 and BO 3 was
working well. In the BO 1 matrix, the PDMS eluting fractions also contain some BO 1
material. It was also concluded that the composition of BO 2 was different from the
BO 3. This was proved from the GC-FID chromatogram of the spiked samples with
low MW PDMS, where none of the BO 2 material and much less of the methyl ester
derivatives were present compared to the BO 3 matrix.
The established FL-SPE was also applied to the fractionation of spiked BO 1 with D3
and D4 cyclic oligomeric PDMS products, and the method was working successfully.
Both D3 and D4, respectively, were isolated from the rest of the matrix material. As
the cyclic oligomers are highly volatile, the samples were not allowed to evaporate
95

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

prior to analysis. Analysis of the eluted fractions without any work-up showed to be
working well, as the oligomers were detected.
The main comparison between the FL-SPE and the SI-SPE was the concentration of
PDMS from the unspiked real BO 1 samples. Since the FL-SPE required several
parallel fractionations, the peak of the PDMS in the HP-SEC chromatogram was much
more defined and more visible. The BO 1 material in the analyzed fractions was much
less for the FL-SPE than the SI-SPE, which indicated that the florisil cartridge could
retain the matrix material better. The advantages of FL-SPE were therefore a better
separation and isolation of the PDMS from the matrix. The disadvantage was the much
lower sample volume and the requirement of several parallel fractionations. The LOD
and LOQ for both methods were quite similar, which indicated similar abilities to
separate components although the SI-SPE was slightly better. However, it is advised
that the LOD and LOQ for the FL-SPE instead would be determined by using much
more data points.
Overall, the newly established SPE method (i.e., FL-SPE) showed good applicability
to all the different MW PDMS and the different matrices. The analytical techniques
for the detection of the PDMS was as follows: the PDMS in the first fractions was
detected by GC-FID and the PDMS in the rest of the fraction was detected by HP-SEC.
The eluted PDMS in the first fractions was low MW. The high MW and medium MW
PDMS were sometimes eluting at the same percentage of DCM in the eluent. In the
case of a sample with a mixture of all three MW PDMS, it might be impossible to
detect the medium MW PDMS, because of overlapping peaks with the matrix material
in the HP-SEC chromatogram. The analytical procedure allowed for detection of the
volatile PDMS products, low MW PDMS, medium MW PDMS, and high MW PDMS,
if they are all in separate bio-oil samples. However, the problem with the procedure
was the quantification of PDMS post-SPE.
For future considerations, this attempt to improve the detection of PDMS showed that
an absolute bottom has already been reached with the SI-SPE. It was not possible to
improve the SI-SPE as much as hoped, however, the FL-SPE showed to separate the
PDMS better from the matrix. If any further improvements should be tested, it should
be to improve the detection and quantification of PDMS after florisil SPE. Another
96

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

improvement that could be tested is to somehow treat the eluted SPE fractions in order
to separate the low and medium MW PDMS from each other, if they are present in the
same fraction.

7 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH – SVENSK
SAMMANFATTNING
Metodutveckling för analys av polydimetylsiloxan i biooljor.
Avhandlingen är uppdelad i två delområden: en teoretisk del och en experimentell del.
I den teoretiska delen behandlas trä- och papperskemi, samt de olika
talloljeprodukterna. Trä- och papperskemin ger en djupare inblick och förståelse av de
olika talloljeprodukterna samt hur de bildas. Den teoretiska delen behandlar även
PDMS och fokuserar på vissa analytiska metoder som kan detektera PDMS. Den
experimentella delen baserades på ett försök att optimera separationen mellan
biooljekomponenter och silikonolja genom SPE. En viktig parameter för SPE var att
uppnå ett högt utbyte för elueringen av silikonolja. Andra parametrar som undersöktes
för

optimeringen

var

till

exempel

och

lösningsmedelskombinationer för elueringen.

7.1 Bakgrund
Alla träd delas in i antingen barrträd eller lövträd. Trots indelningen består ändå alla
träd av celler, som består av både strukturella och icke-strukturella komponenter.5 De
strukturella komponenterna i träd är cellulosa, hemicellulosor och lignin, vilka också
är trädens huvudkomponenter. De icke-strukturella komponenterna i träd är
extraktivämnen

och

andra

vattenlösliga

komponenter.

I

jämförelse

med

huvudkomponenterna förekommer extraktivämnena endast i små mängder, men trots
det är de intressanta med tanke på att de påverkar trädets egenskaper i hög grad,
speciellt under tillverkningsprocessen för pappersmassa.7 Ett exempel på hur
extraktivämnena påverkar massakokningen är att utbytet av massan minskar i och med
att mängden extraktivämnen i utgångsmaterialet ökar.
Massakokning är en metod som tillverkar pappersmassa från trästockar eller -flis.8 Det
är vanligast att massakokningen är antingen mekanisk eller kemisk. Den största
biprodukten från massakokningen är svartlut. Bioraffinering utnyttjar svartluten för att
tillverka värdefulla produkter så som energi, biomaterial eller kemikalier. 19 Genom
98

Charlotte Holmberg

Master’s thesis

olika kemiska metoder kan man utgående från svartluten framställa olika
talloljeprodukter, till exempel CTO eller TOP1 eller till och med bränsle.20
Olika talloljeprodukter innehåller olika mängder av tallfettsyror, tallharts och
oförtvålbara föreningar.21 Figur 3 illustrerar den kemiska strukturen för de vanligaste
tallfettsyrorna. Figur 4 illustrerar strukturen för de vanligaste föreningarna av
tallharts.1 Figur 5 illustrerar strukturen för de vanligaste oförtvålbara föreningarna.21
Användningsområden för tallolja delas in i vilken typ av talloljeprodukt det är frågan
om.1

Tallfettsyror

kan

användas

som

skyddande

beläggningar,

tvålar,

rengöringsmedel, smörjmedel, textiler eller gummiprodukter. Tallharts kan användas
för produktion av kemikalier eller bläck, bindemedel, beläggningar samt gummi.
Kännetecknande för silikonpolymerer är den upprepande kisel–syre-enheten, vilken
även förekommer i PDMS.28 Förutom kisel–syre-skeletten har silikonpolymerer oftast
förgreningar, vilka kan vara organiska föreningar såsom metyl, fenyl eller vinyl.
Specifika egenskaper för silikonpolymerer är väldigt låg ytspänning och en hög
gaspermeabilitet.29 För övrigt är egenskaperna för silikonpolymerer modifierbara och
polymererna

har

därmed

ett

brett

användningsområde.

Exempelvis

kan

silikonpolymerer användas inom livsmedelsindustrin eller som tillsatsämnen i
skönhetsprodukter. Silikonpolymerer har även en stor medicinsk användning.
En vanlig produkt som består av silikonpolymerer är antiskummedel. Antiskummedel
är viktigt för processer i bland annat livsmedelsindustrin eller inom trä- och
pappersindustrin.29 Antiskummedel inom trä- och pappersindustrin är oftast baserade
på en dispersion av kiselpartiklar25 genererade från PDMS.4 PDMS används som källa
för kiselpartiklar på grund av den låga ytspänningen. 26 Det finns även antiskummedel
som är baserade på kolväten. Utan antiskummedel skulle både produktionen och
säkerheten för miljön reduceras, på grund av skumbildningen.23 Kisel från
antiskummedel anses dock även vara ett problem speciellt vid bioraffinering av
svartluten från massatillverkningen.4
Analys av silikonpolymerer kan göras med ett flertal allmänt använda
analysmetoder.29 Exempel på användbara metoder är FTIR, GC, NMR, GPC eller
SEC.

7.2 Experimentell del
Detta arbete är baserat på, och fungerade som en fortsättning på, ett tidigare arbete
skrivet av Kenneth Arandia.54 Målet med den experimentella delen av arbetet var att
öka separationen mellan PDMS och materialet av bioolja då SPE utförs. Andra mål
med arbetet var också att öka utbytet för PDMS som eluerar genom SPE-kolonner
samt att öka detektionen för PDMS med HP-SEC.
De experimentella procedurerna i detta arbete var lösningsmedelsextraktion och SPE.
De analytiska metoderna var HP-SEC och GC. För lösningsmedelsextraktion
användes metanol och hexan, eftersom de är två icke-blandbara lösningsmedel. De
olika biooljorna fraktionerades mellan metanol och hexan, varefter hexanfasen
användes för vidare experiment. SPE utfördes många gånger, med lite varierande
parametrar varje gång. De viktigaste testen i början var kontroll av vilket
lösningsmedel samt vilket material på SPE-kolonnen som fungerade bäst. Därefter
testades elueringen av PDMS, både som rent och blandat med olika biooljor. En
jämförelse mellan molekylvikten för PDMS utfördes också i och med att alla tre olika
molekylvikter (hög, medel, låg) testades genom fraktionering med SPE.

7.3 Resultat, diskussion och slutsatser
Lösningsmedelsextraktionen fördelade komponenterna av biooljorna mellan metanol
och hexan. Gravimetriskt förekom 54–79 % av komponenterna i hexanfasen för en typ
av bioolja. För två andra typer av bioolja innehöll hexanfasen gravimetriskt mera än
85 %. Denna skillnad berodde på de olika sammansättningarna för de tre olika
biooljorna.
Slutsatsen från testerna med SPE är att diklormetan var det bästa lösningsmedlet. De
olika lösningsmedlen som testades var diklormetan, kloroform, etylacetat, aceton,
etanol, tetrahydrofuran, metyl-tert-betyleter och toluen. De olika kolonnmaterialen
som jämfördes var CN, florisil, OH i form av diol, NH2 och SiOH. Kolonner med CNmaterial visade sig eluera mest av ren PDMS, men dessa kolonner förkastades i och
med att de inte kunde separera en blandning av PDMS och bioolja. Kolonner med
100

florisilmaterial var det näst bästa alternativet och dessa användes därmed för alla
efterföljande experiment.
I och med de olika testerna för SPE jämfördes florisilkolonnen ofta med SiOHkolonnen. En av skillnaderna som observerades var att PDMS ur ett blandat prov
(PDMS och bioolja) kunde möjligtvis bli mera koncentrerat efter SPE genom en
florisilkolonn jämfört med efter SiOH-kolonnen. Detta observerades i och med att
mindre material av biooljan eluerade i samma fraktioner som PDMS. En annan
skillnad som upptäcktes var att vid jämförelse med kolonner av samma storlek kunde
SiOH-kolonnen fraktionera en betydligt större mängd prov. Florisilkolonnen klarade
inte av att fraktionera lika stor volym, eftersom tecken på överbelastning då
framträdde. En SiOH-kolonn med 1000 mg material kunde fraktionera 1,5 ml prov,
medan en florisilkolonn av samma storlek kunde fraktionera endast 0,2 ml prov. En
lösning till skillnaden i provvolymen var att utföra flera parallella fraktioneringar med
florisilkolonnen eller att använda endast en florisilkolonn av en mycket större storlek.
Den utvecklade FL-SPE-metoden kunde även anpassas till både medel- och
lågmolekylärt PDMS samt till cykliska oligomerer av D3 och D4 PDMSdegraderingsprodukter i bioolja som bakgrundsmedium. Fraktioneringen av
medelmolekylärt PDMS visade sig vara tydlig, i och med att varje fraktion bestod av
PDMS med olika molekylära storlekar. För varje fraktion, då polariteten ökade,
eluerades högre molekylärt PDMS. Lågmolekylärt PDMS eluerades i de mest opolära
fraktionerna, vilket även gällde för D3 och D4 PDMS-degraderingsprodukterna.
FL-SPE jämfördes även med den tidigare utvecklade SI-SPE-metoden. Som tidigare
nämnt, krävdes flera parallella fraktioneringar med florisilkolonnen jämfört med
SiOH-kolonnen. De parallella fraktioneringarna gjorde därmed att den fraktionerade
PDMS uppvisades mycket tydligare i HP-SEC kromatogrammet än för SI-SPE. LOD
och LOQ räknades också ut för FL-SPE och jämfördes med SI-SPE. Värdena för LOD
och LOQ är 37 ppm och 113 ppm för FL-SPE, jämfört med 30 ppm och 92 ppm för
SI-SPE, vilket indikerar att båda metoderna ändå är ganska jämförbara.
Den utarbetade analytiska proceduren möjliggjorde detektion av de flyktiga D3 och D4
PDMS-degraderingsprodukterna samt låg-, medel- och högmolekylärt PDMS,

förutsatt att de förekom i skilda prover av bioolja. De flyktiga D3 och D4
PDMS-degraderingsprodukterna och lågmolekylärt PDMS kunde detekteras med
GC-FID. Medel- och högmolekylärt PDMS detekterades bäst med HP-SEC. Generellt
sett kunde den utvecklade FL-SPE-metoden anpassas för separation av alla de olika
PDMS-produkterna som testades samt var separationen av PDMS-produkterna även
möjlig i olika bakgrundsmedier.
