Title: Knowledge-sharing behavior in the Northwestern Region of Russia

Abstract: Knowledge Management (KM) techniques have been widely used in organizational
frameworks all over the world during the past decades. Nowadays, companies tend to integrate
effective KM solutions, pursuing the idea of high competitiveness and employee involvement.
Knowledge-sharing behavior is internally cultivated and has the potential of bringing companies
to a new level. However, while some practices have proven to be useful, others may not work at
all. Therefore, the factors which impact the effectiveness of organizational knowledge sharing can
be examined and transformed into a theory-based conceptual model in order to support the core
proposal of the study – that successful knowledge management affects the overall competitiveness
of the firm.
The purpose of this master's thesis is to test an existing conceptual framework in order to reveal
the factors which influence the knowledge-sharing behavior and, therefore, a firm's
competitiveness in the context of Northwestern region of Russia. The choice of this particular area
is due to the lack of academic insights regarding knowledge-sharing practices in Russia.
Furthermore, the absence of knowledge sharing as a holistic concept in Russian organizational
culture, makes this topic potentially original and requires scientific explanation and interpretation.
The conceptual model developed by Youssef, Haak-Saheem & Youssef, (2017) is tested in the
context of Russian organizational management involving 120 participants from various industries
operating in the Northwestern region of Russia. The data are analyzed through the structural
equation modelling method in order to test the impact of top management support, openness and
trust and reward system on the knowledge-sharing behavior and consequently their impact on the
firm’s competitiveness.
The findings illustrate that the construct of openness & trust knowledge positively affects the
organizational knowledge sharing. However, the top management support and reward system do
not have any significant effect, therefore it is concluded that these factors do not have a strong
impact on the knowledge sharing in Russian firms. In addition, the SEM results show that the
knowledge-sharing behavior has a significant effect on the firm’s competitiveness. The mediation
analysis indicates that the knowledge-sharing behavior only mediates the relationship between
openness and trust, and firm's competitiveness. Moreover, a path between openness and trust, and
firm’s competitiveness is moderated by the academic education level of the respondents when

multi-group analysis was performed. This master thesis concludes that openness and trust are
fundamental factors affecting the knowledge-sharing behavior in Russian organizations, as well
as having an impact on the overall competitiveness level.

Chapter 1: Introduction
This master’s thesis focuses on knowledge-sharing behavior as one of the key concepts in
an organizational setting and it examines this concept in the context of Knowledge Sharing
(KS) and Knowledge Management (KM). The main purpose of this master’s thesis is to
investigate how knowledge-sharing behavior impacts an organization's competitiveness and
assesses the role that factors such as openness and trust, top management support and the
reward system play in terms of knowledge management practices, and in particular on the
firm’s competitiveness at the organizations in the Northwestern region of Russia. The thesis
includes proposed conceptual model and a questionnaire based on data collected from 120
Russian employees working in various organizations.
In this introductory chapter, the main topic of the research will be discussed, followed by the
objective reasoning and motivation of the chosen area of study. The conceptual model will
be further introduced (Chapter 3), and it will be viewed in the context of knowledge
management. The model will be supported by the findings received through the
questionnaire (Chapter 5). The thesis’ structure can be found at the end of the introduction
chapter.

1.1. Motivation of the topic
“In an economy where the only certainty is uncertainty, the one sure source of lasting
competitive advantage is knowledge...successful companies are those that consistently
create new knowledge, disseminate it widely throughout the organization, and quickly
embody it in new technologies and products" (Nonaka, 2007, p. 162).
In the past decades the role of knowledge and intellectual resources has risen significantly
in terms of economic growth and innovative development. The new emerging economy
which is based on the knowledge management – a “knowledge economy" is becoming a
fundamental ground for the modern management. As a result, many companies are facing
the challenge of transforming intellectual capital (human knowledge) into intellectual assets
(corporate knowledge). Constantly growing demand for the knowledge sharing has caused

11

Mariia Pokryshkina

a high academic interest in the management of knowledge, which has generated plenty of
informal research on the KM contribution to the business value creation (Heisig, Kianto,
Perez, & Fathi, 2016). The lack of the proper knowledge sharing has been described in many
sources, for example, Heisig et al. (2016) claim that according to the data collected from US
Fortune 500 companies, they lose a total of $31.5 bn every year from the poor knowledgesharing behavior among employees (Heisig et al., 2016; Myers, 2015).
However, while the majority of the studies conducted are Western-oriented and are mostly
focused on the Western organizational culture, the implications of the analyzed data are not
always found to be relevant in the non-Western market economies. Culture has a massive
impact on the company's climate and it is seen as a set of basic ideas and values that help
community members to adapt to the external environment (“how to survive”) and to internal
integration (“how to stay together”) (Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2006; Schein, 1992).
Additionally, in most Russian companies’, organizational culture is simply “absorbed” by
employees in the process of work without any additional formalized explanations. Moreover,
many Russian employees consider formalized explanations of organizational culture to be
artificial and unpleasant (Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2006). Furthermore, quite often knowledgesharing skills in the organizations are absent or they are neglected due to the lack of
information or low motivation of the employees. Therefore, such a vague framework of an
organizational culture may undermine the KM practices' implementation. Thus, the purpose
of this master’s thesis is to reflect on the Russian knowledge sharing practices in terms of
the organization management.

1.2. Background
In the modern cross-cultural and saturated business world it is still impossible to distinguish
one holistic approach towards organizational management. "Organizational culture is a
system of norms, rules, habits, values; defined, accepted or rejected by the members of an
organization, which is apparent in their behavior and reactions" (Deal & Kennedy, 1982,
2000; Heidrich, 2000; Kotter & Heskett, 1992; Schein, 1992, as cited in Jarjabka, 2014,

12

Mariia Pokryshkina

p.20). As organizational culture is deeply embedded in the local culture, certain challenges
may occur while implementing such concepts as organizational management and knowledge
management.
An essential factor that drastically differentiates Western and Russian organizational culture
is the unusual level of collectivism/individualism. This is due to the fact that Russians are
prone to collectivist behavior on a small group scale, however, having left their “close"
circle, they tend to demonstrate the growth of individualistic behavior (Andreeva & Ihilchik,
2006; Holt, Ralston & Terpstra, 1994; House et al., 2004). In such conditions, Russian
managers may be challenged to find the ways of unifying employees and creating an
environment based on trust and openness for the future knowledge sharing.
In many KM works, researchers including Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995) and Glisby & Holden
(2003) tend to oppose the Western and Eastern approaches regarding the development of
theories and managerial practice. Firstly, Russia, being "somewhere in between" often falls
out of this classification which leaves a lot of practical questions to answer. Secondly,
although there are studies on the applicability of the foreign management theories in Russia
(Andreeva, 2008; Elenkov, 1998; Fey & Denison, 2003), only a few of them review the
knowledge management (Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2006; May, Puffer & McCarthy, 2005).
Unfortunately, most of the Russian-language literature on the knowledge management, does
not take into consideration the applicability of the Western organizational management
concepts in Russia (Inozemtsev, 2000; Marinicheva, 2008; Milner, 2006, as cited in
Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2006). Thus, there is a gap which could be bridged with the help of the
following work by observing the characteristics of the knowledge management in Russian
organizations.
1.2.1. Knowledge management
Knowledge management (KM) has recently become a popular practice due to the necessity
of knowledge workers to share and convey a great internal potential which needs to be
revealed: their embedded skills and experiences. Undoubtedly, knowledge management is

13

Mariia Pokryshkina

one of the keyways to succeed in a business perspective, as it is a source of the intellectual
capital in every company. Knowledge management is also known as a systematic, goaloriented application of measures to steer and control the tangible and intangible knowledge
assets of organizations, with the aim of using existing knowledge inside and outside of these
organizations to enable the creation of new knowledge, and generate value, innovation and
improvement out of it (Wunram, 2000). Knowing how to organize the knowledge flow, an
organization can improve the quality solutions, increase its productivity and enlarge the
fields of practice.
Nowadays, many companies search for the ways to stay competitive and successful in the
current market and one of the latest trends has been creating “learning organizations”
(Goncalves, 2012; Marquardt, 2011; Senge, 2006; Serrat, 2017) which are based on the KM
practices. As companies foresee that there is a great potential embedded in their personnel,
they become more interested in continuous learning and knowledge sharing facilitation.
However, the lack of information regarding organizational culture attributes participating in
the knowledge-sharing process may hinder its efficiency and progress. Moreover, the
unsystematic flow of knowledge into an organization or the total negligence of strategically
important knowledge may lead to an opportunity loss and even performance collapse. As a
result, due to the high competitiveness of the modern business environment, companies seek
the best KS solutions and methods (Golitsina, Kupriyanov & Maksimov, 2015; Maier &
Hadrich, 2011; Serrat, 2010).

1.2.2. Skills shortage
In the modern competitive world, there is no place for the non-professionals – there is a
constant need for qualified and skilled workers. Experts and highly skilled workers constitute
the core human capital of an organization. The concept of human capital originates from the
economic literature: professor of Economics and Sociology at the University of Chicago
Gary S. Becker explained the nature of human capital in his work Human Capital: A
Theoretical and Empirical Analysis with Special Reference to Education (1964). "An
investment in human capital would usually steepen age-earning profiles, lowering reported
earnings during the investment period and raising them later on" (Becker, 1975, p. 43).
14

Mariia Pokryshkina

Human capital is described as the combination of knowledge, skill, creativity and health of
the person. It is a type of intangible assets – not a physical nor a financial one (Pasban &
Nojedeh, 2016). Investments into the human capital promote economic growth in a longrun: organizations are challenged not only to retain skilled employees but also to constantly
encourage them to adopt a habit of creating, sharing and applying their knowledge, thus,
increasing organizational knowledge (Pasban & Nojedeh, 2016; Stiles & Kulvisaechana,
2003).
However, many organizations are still facing the skills shortage across the business
landscape. In his blogpost, Gillian Livingston (2013, p. 1) refers to a problem as a "skill
crisis which is a barrier to competitiveness". Michael Denham, a managing director for
Accenture in Canada states that the skills shortage induces companies to rethink their
traditional patterns and habits. In other words, companies need to diversify the spectrum of
their businesses and find new solutions through developing new organizational structures,
operating models so that they are focused on the skills rather than on the business functions
(Livingston, 2013). Furthermore, employees with different backgrounds and qualifications
can participate in the work of HR, logistics or operation departments. Thus, multitasking and
diversification contributes to a better understanding which skills employee possesses and
how to apply it in terms of competitive advantage. This approach is a cost-cutting method
and it also contributes to developing a knowledge sharing groundwork (Livingston, 2013).
The greatest challenge of all human resource departments is to bridge the gap between the
lack of talent and skills and firm's competitiveness. In other words, employees’ education
and training are undoubtedly beneficial but recruiting potentially highly qualified personnel
is yet a challenge. An efficient recruitment is also a way for a better talent acquisition. Many
businesses are in pursuit of the perfect candidate who has to fulfil very strict and narrow
criteria. In order to attract and recruit suitable employees, organizations should rather seek
individuals who prove their ability to learn and who fit the company's culture the most. By
organizing internal training programs, employers help employees to gain the necessary
skills. Through creating such communities, businesses create a "pool of skilled workers"
(Livingston, 2013; Nguyen, 2017).

1.2.3. Competitiveness and knowledge management in Russia
While modern economy is characterized as the economy of knowledge, the main factor in
ensuring the competitiveness of the economic entities is the intellectual resources and
knowledge accumulated in the organization (Kharitonova, 2013). According to Philip
Kotler, competitiveness is the ability to withstand competition in comparison with similar
objects (goods, services, manufacturers) in a certain market (Kotler, 1967). Therefore, the
best way to maintain strategic competitiveness is the ability of an organization to
dynamically adjust and receive new knowledge about the current market and consumers.
This could be compared to a living system, organism or an entity in terms of innovative
development. Knowledge, indeed, has a great potential and the action of sharing it is an
effective approach to maintaining the competitiveness of organizations (Grant, 1996; HaakSaheem et al, 2016; Penrose, 1952; Sabetzadeh & Tsui, 2011; Yam & Chan, 2015, as cited
in Youssef et al. 2017).
It was only in the 20th century when knowledge started to be seen as a driving force for the
economic development. This was due to the incorporation of industrial, technological and
social changes (for example the scientific and technical progress, globalization or high
competition) which served as an incentive towards the transition to a new qualitative level
in the theoretical understanding of knowledge. Thus, global development has nudged the
economy to view the knowledge as a factor of economic growth and as a potential
competitiveness means (Kharitonova, 2013).
A transition from scattered companies and firms to bigger networks between the large and
middle-sized companies which rely on the Internet and IT solutions allowed businesses to
cooperate in the fields of technology, product quality control and innovation. Consequently,
active internal (between employees) and external (between companies) collaboration raises
the level of organizational empathy and trust. Moreover, it contributes to the knowledge
exchange and innovation creation. Respectively, the sources of competitive advantage are

16

Mariia Pokryshkina

considered as the organizational abilities (competencies) which are the positive outcomes of
the individual knowledge integration (Kharitonova, 2013).
Based on the studies of the knowledge management practices in leading companies across
the globe, Kharitonova (2013) proposes to distinguish four types of established approaches
of the knowledge management – European, American, Japanese and Russian. In this work
the attention will be given to the Russian approach, compared to the European type. The
European approach is characterized by a focus on the intellectual capital and on the
evaluation of the company's knowledge and intellectual property level. While the European
approach has been already formed and proved its functioning, the Russian approach is in "its
infancy" – meaning that is still emerging and developing under the local economy. It is
oriented on the combination of communication technologies and information, administrative
and organizational tools, creating a corporate culture based on the knowledge management
support (Kharitonova, 2013). Moreover, due to the relatively recent transition from the Soviet
planned economy to the capitalism-oriented economy (Puffer & McCarthy, 2011), Russian
knowledge management is still undergoing certain alterations, relying on the increasing
individualism, professional qualification and competitiveness growth (Klafke. Lievore,
Picinin, de Francisco & Pilatti, 2016).
Puffer and McCarthy (2011) add that the knowledge management in Russia was traditionally
viewed as a not important technique and it was ill-managed. However, a market transition
increased the demand for the business management education (McCarthy, 1991; Puffer,
1992, as cited in Puffer & McCarthy, 2011). Consequently, Russian companies have faced
the problem of a low applicability of the Western teaching methods and content relevance,
and, a as result, unwillingness of the managers to perceive the new information (Czinkota,
1997; Gilbert & Cartwright, 2008; Holden & Cooper, 1994; Warner, Denezhkina &
Campbell, 1994, as cited in Puffer & McCarthy, 2011). Mentioning the cultural imprints,
which are deeply rooted in the Russian business culture and ethics, (Taylor, Kazakov &
Thompson, 1997, as cited in Puffer & McCarthy, 2011), authors address such culturally based
habits as sviazi (connections) and blat (the use of favors). Combined with the Soviet past’s
inherited traits (collectivism, paternalism, admiration of strong leaders, fear of responsibility,

17

Mariia Pokryshkina

mistrust of outsiders, reliance on one own’s own networks), such habits clearly promote
corruption and “hinder Russia’s economic development and integration into the global
economy” (Puffer & McCarthy, 2011, p. 25). Therefore, quite often, a Russian management
culture and business practices are “counter to internationally accepted ways of doing
business” (Puffer & McCarthy, 2011, p. 25). Hence, it allows to conclude that Russian
knowledge management is highly influenced by the specific socio-cultural factors, which are
not fully presented in the Western culture.
1.3. Objectives of the thesis and research questions
It is not a secret that knowledge is the most attractive asset of the company – it is tightly
linked with its strategy, competitive performance and daily managerial operations.
Nowadays, many companies are facing the challenge of preventing their employees from
hoarding the knowledge: the belief that hoarded knowledge is a great competitive advantage
is still strong among personnel. "From the perspectives of the employees, organizations are
now asking them to share the very thing that earns them the positions they hold and their
hope of financial reward and advancement" (Milne, 2007, p. 28). Therefore, facilitating the
knowledge sharing in a company might be hard to execute if the workers are not wellprepared or motivated enough.
Obviously, thoughtful and beneficial KM involves the participation of the employees,
therefore, this master’s thesis addresses the question of the workers' concern and interaction
within the KM practices in Russia. In this thesis the country of choice is Russia, and the area
of focus is its Northwestern region due to the differences between Russian and European
economy and general distinction in the organizational culture. Russia is quite a specific
market with a great potential where the knowledge management is a relatively new concept.
The choice of Northwestern region is also due to the possibility to collect data, carrying out
the questionnaire and personal interest in the region. Thus, this master’s thesis investigates
the particular qualities of the knowledge management executed in Russia. Furthermore, the
goal of the thesis is to find out how implemented KM practices in Russian companies affect
the creation of greater value and efficiency gains. In other words, the collected data helps to
identify the correlation between knowledge sharing and several influential factors such as:

18

Mariia Pokryshkina

openness and trust, top management support and reward system implemented in Russian
companies. Moreover, this thesis puts a question of a linkage between the knowledge
sharing and overall competitiveness of a firm in the Russian market – the analysis of the
observed information provides the evidence of the following statement. The overall aim of
this master’s thesis is to identify the factors which are conducive to the knowledge sharing
activities inside the organizations in Russia and which, in their turn, promote higher
competitiveness.
Therefore, the following research questions are formulated:


RQ1: How do openness, trust, top management support and reward systems promote the
knowledge sharing in organizations?



RQ2: How does the knowledge sharing affect the overall competitiveness of the
organizations?

1.4. Structure of the thesis
This section presents a designed structure of this master’s thesis. Introduction chapter is
followed by the chapter which covers the key concepts and previous research on KM and
knowledge sharing. First, the concepts of knowledge and information are introduced
(Sections 2.1-2.2), leading to the discussion of the knowledge types, which are illustrated in
the SECI model (Section 2.3). Section 2.4 describes the knowledge economy as an essential
prerequisite for the successful knowledge management (Section 2.5) and knowledge sharing
(Section 2.6) implementation. The chapter goes on with the discussion of how knowledge
sharing influences the organizational performance (Section 2.7).
Chapter 3 introduces the research context of Russia – it describes the key features forming
the economy of Russia (Section 3.1), provides the insights into the modern knowledge
management (Section 3.2) and knowledge sharing practices in Russia (Section 3.3). The
following sub-sections address the specific knowledge sharing models implemented by the
managers in Russian companies (3.3.1) for the performance growth (3.3.2), the knowledge
management challenges (3.3.3) finishing with the knowledge-sharing hostility phenomenon

19

Mariia Pokryshkina

and its determinants (3.3.4). The competitiveness factors in the Russian market are further
discussed (Section 3.4), followed by the overview of the specific factors (top management
support, openness and trust, reward system) and their role in the organizational knowledge
sharing framework (Section 3.5). The chapter ends with the conceptual model representation
(Section 3.6).
Chapter 3 is followed by a methodology chapter, introducing a comparative description of
the quantitative and qualitative research methods (Section 4.1), subsequently providing the
reasoning for the chosen approach (Section 4.2). Moreover, the measurement models for the
relationships between proposed constructs are represented in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4.
The methodology then goes on to the sample and data collection (Section 4.5).
The results and data analysis are discussed in the Chapter 5 in detail. The main focus of this
chapter is to reveal the main outcomes of the following study and to validate the conceptual
model’s applicability in the context of the Russian organizational management. Obtained
data is reviewed under the descriptive analysis section (5.1), presenting the demographic
background of the respondents: age (Section 5.1.1), education (Section 5.1.2), industry type
(Section 5.1.3) and the job function of the participants (Section 5.1.4). Finally, the chapter
leads to the measurement model results (Section 5.2) and the structural model results (Section
5.3). A multi-group analysis (Section 5.4) and a mediation analysis (Section 5.5) are further
discussed, implementing some qualitative insights (Section 5.6).
Finally, the last chapter presents the discussion and the practical implications of the following
research, touching upon the main findings (Section 6.1), subsequently providing the answers
to the proposed research questions (Section 6.2). It further explains a theoretical and practical
contribution of this master’s thesis, illustrating an alternative conceptual model (Section 6.3).
Moreover, the chapter considers the possible limitations applied to this study (Section 6.4)
and future research (Section 6.5).

Chapter 2: Key concepts and previous research on KM and
knowledge sharing

The following chapter focuses on the concepts of the knowledge and knowledge sharing. It
gives a deeper understanding of what knowledge is and what are the advantages of sharing
it in the organizations. The described SECI model illustrates the processes happening under
knowledge sharing in detail – a conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge. Moreover, this
chapter aims at bringing to light such a concept as the knowledge economy – a modern
knowledge-driven society. Being opposed to the traditional economy, the knowledge
economy focuses on the intellectual property advocacy and innovation integration.
Furthermore, this chapter addresses several proposed competitive factors (openness and
trust, top management support and organizational reward system) and their ability to affect
the knowledge sharing processes in organizations and firm’s competitiveness.
2.1. Definition of knowledge / epistemology of knowledge
Knowledge is "[1] facts, information and skills acquired through experience or education;
the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject; [2] the sum of what is known; [3]
information held on a computer system; [4] in philosophy: true, justified belief; certain
understanding, as opposed to opinion; [5] awareness or familiarity gained by experience of
a fact or situation (Oxford dictionary, 2018).
The first person who has seriously brought the subject of knowledge was philosopher Plato
– one of the main figures who had a great influence on the development of the Western
Philosophy. "Plato (429? –347 BC) is, by any reckoning, one of the most dazzling writers in
the Western literary tradition and one of the most penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential
authors in the history of philosophy" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), 2004).
According to Michael Welbourne (2001), Plato claimed that it is human inborn interest to
know and to obtain the knowledge about the nature of things. Moreover, he believed that
knowledge could be acquired and could be taught to other people. (Welbourne, 2001). Thus,

22

Mariia Pokryshkina

endowing the personal knowledge with all the features of an asset, Plato emphasized the role
of the human intellectual capital.
The contemporary view on knowledge has been described in the knowledge management
literature with a great focus on the subjectivity and situational, implicit and dynamic nature
of the knowledge (Alvesson & Karreman, 2001). "Knowledge is a subset of information; it
is subjective; it is linked to meaningful behavior; and it has tacit elements born of
experience" (Leonard and Sensiper, 1998, p. 113). According to McDermott (1999, as cited
in Alvesson & Karreman, 2001), knowledge is always recreated in the present moment. Most
of us cannot articulate what we know. It is largely invisible and often comes to mind when
we need it to answer a question or solve a problem.
One of the most interesting traits of knowledge is that the production of knowledge for the
sake of knowledge does not have any socio-economic value. Meaning that knowledge on its
own cannot meet the financial needs of a human. Nevertheless, the product creation within
the economy starts with a certain piece of knowledge leading to its future implementation.
Furthermore, the only source of knowledge is human, therefore, the knowledge creation is
tightly linked with one's living standards – the higher they are, the more likely the qualitative
knowledge would be generated (Gluznitskiy, 2017).
Nowadays, the perception of knowledge as of a commodity is widely justified by its public
aspect – the ubiquitous usage of the knowledge. In his work, Welbourne (2001) explains
why the knowledge has its value – "knowledge owes its value ultimately to the value we
rightly place on getting beliefs that are true". He also suggests that it naturally happens
because people need to know the methods of obtaining "true beliefs" for the successful life.
In other words, knowledge is a consequence of the apprehension of objective facts, an
experience. People gain experience through observation, education or information exchange
– it is all the result of the human interaction.
There are other definitions of knowledge which contributed to the understanding of the
concept. Davenport and Prusak in their book "Working knowledge: How Organizations

23

Mariia Pokryshkina

Manage What They Know” (1998) had emphasized the difference between data, information
and knowledge. According to them, "knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, values,
contextual information, and expert insight that provides a framework for evaluating and
incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of
knowers" (Davenport & Prusak, 1998, p. 5). They claim that knowledge originates and
resides in people's minds, being hard to define and concretize. Moreover, they say that it is
embedded in the organizational workflow and activities. Davenport & Prusak compare the
knowledge with the atomic particle – it can be seen as both process and stock. Explaining
the great value of knowledge, the authors say that it is close to action – knowledge plays an
important role in decision making, for example a strategy choice based on the previous
experience. Having an ability to develop over time, knowledge relies on experience
(Davenport & Prusak, 1998). Expertise allows companies to use previous experience for
creating new: "knowledge born of experience recognizes familiar patterns and can make
connections between what is happening now and what happened then" (Nonaka, 2005,
p.307).
The value of knowledge has been emphasized a lot during the past decades due to the primary
role of human capital in businesses. Not only has the knowledge gained great potential, it
has also become a valuable commodity which is embedded in the tacit knowledge of agile
workers (Dalkir, 2011). Rapid industrialization and development of IT have naturally laid
the groundwork for the knowledge-intensive era. Nowadays, companies tend to create, store,
share and consume the knowledge for constant improvement. "A firm only gains sustainable
advances from what it collectively knows, how efficiently it uses what it knows, and how
quickly it acquires and uses new knowledge" (Davenport & Prusak 1998, as cited in Dalkir,
2011, p.2).
In the world of constant work environment changes, it is essential to be able to classify,
structure, detect and deploy the knowledge as a tool for successful organization work.
Knowledge serves as a core asset and a platform of a company as everything is based upon
it.

24

Mariia Pokryshkina

Numerous examples of big enterprises using knowledge sharing as a tool have proved the
effectiveness of sharing information within an organization: e.g. Toyota, Ford, Dow
Chemical (Yang & Chen, 2007). According to Cabrera and Cabrera (2002), in the KPMG
industry survey of year 2000, 81 percent of the leading organizations in Europe and the
United States said that they had, or they were planning to implement some knowledge
management systems (KMPG, 2000).
The quality of the knowledge and ability to use it accordingly plays a primary role in the
modern organizational management. It is not enough to possess the information, more
importantly is how the company manages it. Referring to this, Dalkir states that the objective
of the knowledge management is a deliberate and systematic approach to ensure the full
utilization of the organization’s knowledge base, combined with the human capital:
individual skills, competencies, thoughts, innovations, and aspiration for a more efficient
and effective organization (Dalkir, 2011).
Increasingly, companies will differentiate themselves on the basis of what they know. A
relevant variation on Sidney Winter’s definition of a business firm as an organization that
knows how to do things would define a business firm that thrives over the next decade as an
organization that knows how to do new things well and quickly (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
In their work, Alvesson and Karreman (2001) state five problems with popular
understandings of knowledge:
1) ontological incoherence;
2) vagueness;
3) an all-embracing and somewhat empty view on knowledge;
4) objectivity and robustness;
5) functionalism
By ontological incoherence Alvesson and Karreman mean the discrepancy between
"knowing subjects and knowable objects" (2001, p. 998). They claim that there is a strong
disparity regarding the concept of knowledge – it is described as somewhat tacit and rather

25

Mariia Pokryshkina

contextual simultaneously with being specific, true and verified. Thus, in our society, the
knowable objects tend to exist as knowing subjects, therefore causing confusion (Shotter,
1993, as cited in Alvesson & Karreman, 2001).
Vagueness occurs when attempts to define contradictory and incoherent ideas regarding the
concept of knowledge are made among the academics and practitioners. Alvesson and
Karreman believe that there is lack of precision when it comes to the nature of knowledge –
the literature tends to "sidestep” or "black-box" the issue (McGrath, 2000, p. 82 as cited in
in Alvesson & Karreman, 2001). Thus, such an ambiguity hinders the future research.
"Knowledge is everything and everything is knowledge" – Alvesson and Karreman refer to
the fact that knowledge, as an umbrella term, tends to lose its semantic power due to the
versatility of meanings it is endowed with. The idea of "delimiting" the concept originates
from the inability to attribute knowledge to one category – it can be encyclopaedic (facts
about the world), procedural (explaining how to accomplish results), social (explaining how
to utilize both encyclopedic and procedural knowledge) or explanatory knowledge
(explaining the reason why) (Alvesson & Karreman, 2001). "Ultimately, knowledge has
many manifestations and is also manifested in many ways – encultured, embodied, encoded,
embedded, and embrained" (Blackler, 1995, as cited in Alvesson and Karreman, 2001, p.
998). Therefore, there is a great paradox – the more extensive the notion is, the less
information it transmits.
According to Alvesson and Karreman, the knowledge management theory’s belief that the
knowledge can be extracted from an individual, kept and reconstructed contradicts with the
fact that even though the formal knowledge is rather rational, people tend to behave less
rationally (Fores et al., 1991, as cited in Alvesson and Karreman, 2001). Only an extremely
small number of workers acts based on the knowledge received from the handbook or
scientific publications – most of the time they prefer to rely on their experience, practice or
business context.

26

Mariia Pokryshkina

Another obstacle for understanding the nature of knowledge is a common belief that
knowledge is necessarily functional, however, the answer why it is functional tends to stay
in the grey area. Alvesson and Karreman (2001) question the usability and the positive side
of knowledge in general. Instead, their discourse aims at revealing the exploitative and power
aspect of the knowledge – quite often the norms of "what things should be like" are
imprinted, therefore it emphasizes a discrepancy between "current imperfections and the
ideal" (Alvesson and Karreman, 2001, p. 999).

Thus, it could be exploited by the

consultancy agencies for their own benefits (Clark, 1995, Ch. 1; Sturdy, 1997 as cited in
Alvesson and Karreman, 2001). Moreover, according to Foucault (1976, 1980), knowledge
is a power tool – "it creates space for the exercise of power… in return, (it) makes knowledge
possible" (as cited in Alvesson and Karreman, 2001, p.1000). Being power-driven,
knowledge tends to construct and create rather than revealing the truth, therefore to
subordinate and even control reality, subjects and institutions (Alvesson & Karreman, 2001).

2.2. Knowledge vs. Information
In this master’s thesis, the concepts of knowledge, knowledge sharing and knowledge
management (KM) are not equal to the concepts of information and information
management (IM). According to Widén-Wulff, KM is a newer concept "in which the human
aspects have emerged as additional insights into the traditional IM and information resources
management (IRM) field" (2007, p.7). The organizational context dictates the difference in
perception as the knowledge tends to be more closely connected to action than to information
(Widén-Wulff, 2007). To illustrate that statement would be fair to say that people make
decisions based on the information that they integrate with their own knowledge (Sinotte,
2004, as cited in Widén-Wulff, 2007).
Various sources related to the knowledge management practices and research tend to cite
Albert Einstein: “Knowledge is experience. Everything else is just information” (18791955). Famous theoretical physicist was right – knowledge is gained through the human
experience and it is usually contrasted with information. In his work, Sveiby (1997) says that
“knowledge cannot be described in words because it is mainly tacit ...”, and “information

27

Mariia Pokryshkina

and knowledge should be seen as distinctly different. Information is entropic (chaotic);
knowledge is nonentropic. The receiver of the information – not the sender – gives it
meaning. Information as such is meaningless” (p. 38, 49). Therefore, the tacit knowledge is
only useful when the receiver is able to understand it, thus, the knowledge is only beneficial
when it is being applied and utilized.
These are the several characteristics created by Sveiby (1997) represented in Table 1 that
help to distinguish the knowledge from information, therefore giving a deeper insight into
the concept of knowledge and eliminating the ambiguity of the terms:

Although knowledge is a very abstract phenomenon, it has unique properties which have to
be taken into consideration while thinking of it as of a competitive advantage (Sveiby, 1997):


Knowledge is dynamic, and its values may transform over time, so it is important to
keep the knowledge up-to-date and to maintain it;



Knowledge facilitates better learning and results;



Knowledge is created and developed through learning;



Technology promotes better knowledge creation, transfer, utilization and distribution;

28

Mariia Pokryshkina



Knowledge relies on experience and memory;



Knowledge depends on the context;



Knowledge is reusable

Ilkka Virtanen in his academic dissertation "How tacit is tacit knowledge? Polanyi’s theory
of knowledge and its application in knowledge management theories" explains that the
owner of the highest quality knowledge has the highest chance to show the best results
(2014). "Hence, the possession of the most resources does not guarantee success, but the
most effective use of available resources" - knowledge utilization is the key to success, and
it needs a proper approach (2014, p.13). Author mentions that such a way of thinking gained
popularity in the organizational context in early 1990's and, since then, knowledge has been
seen as "the key asset leading to economic progress, competitive advantage and business
success in organizations" (2014, p.13).
Being a complex concept, knowledge could be interpreted in different ways, as well as there
are several theories of knowledge which exist nowadays. Knowledge is undoubtedly a multifaceted concept - Von Krogh and Venzin have suggested seven categories of knowledge
applied in the organizational theory: tacit, embodied, encoded, embrained, embedded, event
and procedural which are widely used in the academic world (Mertins, Heisig & Vorbeck,
2001; Von Krogh, Venzin, 1995). The concepts of tacit and explicit knowledge will be
introduced in the following section.
In this master’s thesis knowledge will be regarded as a means for competitiveness; the main
question is: how knowledge-sharing behavior is reinforced by the openness and trust in the
company, support from the top management and reward systems within the knowledge
management field? The list of the knowledge sharing factors described in this thesis is
limited due to the specification of the research, however it could be further complemented
and expanded by other practitioners.

2.3. SECI model: tacit and explicit types of knowledge
One of the most famous models which describes the organizational knowledge processes
was developed and presented by Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi (1995) in the book
"The Knowledge-creating Company”. According to Nonaka and Takeuchi there are two
types of knowledge: tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is described as a
subjective, context specific knowledge which is based on experience and, therefore, it is
impossible to express it verbally (words, sentences, numbers). The term "tacit knowledge"
belongs to Michael Polanyi (1958) and it explains the nature of the knowledge which cannot
be transmitted through the verbal means and it can only be detected and evolved via practice.
Tacit knowledge is represented by the ability to speak languages, to cook or by different
ideas, skills and experiences which cannot be easily decoded and expressed. Explicit
knowledge, on the contrary, is an objective knowledge which can be articulated through the
verbal means, moreover, it can be classified, stored and shared between the individuals and
organizations. Explicit knowledge is context free, rational, easy to code and it can be
represented by databases, manuals or via problem solving.
In order to understand the processes behind the knowledge sharing, it is important to analyze
its core processes. The SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization)
model developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi in 1995 is a cycle model which describes four
modes of tacit and explicit knowledge conversion. A model works as a spiral when it’s seen
as a continuous learning process because the creation of the knowledge is a dynamic process
which demands a binding interaction and cooperation between the both tacit and explicit
knowledge (see Figure 2).

30

Figure 2: SECI model developed
Note: source: Nonaka (1994), Nonaka et al. (1994), Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995), Nonaka et al. (2000),
(2001a), Nonaka & Toyama (2003).

The first process is called socialization and it converts the tacit knowledge of one person into
the tacit knowledge of another person. It is a non-verbal knowledge transfer which involves
a direct interaction between people within an organization. It can be capturing knowledge
through communication with the people inside or outside an organization. Another process
is called externalization, which means converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge.
Such a process is based on the dialogue and it is demonstrated either by expressing one’s
ideas and experiences in words or by «translating» tacit knowledge into a form that the others
are able to understand, therefore, people transmit their way of thinking through ideas'
interexchange. As soon as the knowledge becomes explicit, it is converted into another
explicit knowledge through the process of combination. According to Nonaka, the
knowledge is mostly transferred with the help of information technologies during this

31

Mariia Pokryshkina

process. The coded knowledge is conveyed from one person to another in the databases,
books, different documents or emails, thus, enabling the knowledge transfer between the
groups and organizations. The last process in the SECI model is called internalization and it
is the way explicit knowledge is converted into tacit, which is performed by the individuals.
In other words, internalization is the process of embodying the explicit knowledge into the
tacit knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) being conveyed through the actual doing and
is transferred from a group to an individual.
The SECI model is based on the communication both on the individual and group levels and
it emphasizes the knowledge sharing which is an important tool in any organization’s
working process. As the human resource still has not been replaced completely, it is valued
in the form of knowledge – either tacit or explicit, although the latter is easier to access and
to share. According to Nonaka, true knowledge is an actionable understanding which
requires to share emotions, experiences and feelings and, therefore, it expects to have a
certain level of a personal commitment. The working conditions and organization’s
environment should be satisfactory in order to provide the high responsiveness within an
organization and the fast knowledge transfer being prepossessing and attractive for the
employees. Trust and cooperation also contribute to the knowledge transformation, because
cooperation is able to erase the boundaries and it tends to lead to a dialogue. The interaction
between employees encourages the learning process among individuals and, therefore, it
increases the amount of knowledge workers inside an organization.
All the mentioned above described processes are mostly based on the interaction between
the individuals and this is where problems may occur. The SECI theory works only when
people do transmit the knowledge. However, the model can be criticized in case if the
individuals are not able or willing to interact at a certain level and it may become a real
obstacle for the knowledge-oriented company.

2.4. Knowledge economy
The term "knowledge economy" was first introduced by Peter Drucker in 1969 in his book
"The Age of Discontinuity". Assuming that humanity was moving "from an economy of
goods [to] ... a knowledge economy", the idea of a knowledge-driven society was formed
(Drucker, 1969). Such factors as an exponential growth of the knowledge-intensive
production, the usage of an innovative approach in many fields of economy, the intellectual
property protection and the diversification of services demonstrate the entrenched position
of the knowledge economy around the world. Moreover, an integration of the knowledge
management among the enterprises and its dissemination is crucial for maintaining
organizational competitiveness and productivity.
To begin with, it is essential to distinguish the knowledge economy from the traditional
economy. According to Gluzitsky (2017), there are three main differences between the two
types:


Goals: while the traditional economy focuses on the profit growth of the invested
capital, the knowledge economy aims at shaping a creative individual;



Means of production: the traditional economy exploits all the available resources
(nature, human resources, IT). However, within the knowledge economy, the efforts
are made in order to have the most effective use and creation of the new knowledge
in symbiosis with people and nature;



Results: the traditional economy promotes the creation of a society based on
personal gain and selfish interest, leading to its stratification and, moreover, causing
wars, terrorism, corruption and spreading poverty. Such an economy subordinates to
the tasks of human development. However, ideally, the knowledge economy
eliminates the principle of unfair wealth distribution, it eliminates the mercenary
interest dominance in the capitalist economy. Furthermore, it reduces the chances of
international and local crises occurring.

33

Mariia Pokryshkina

Within the organizational context, a company is able to anticipate the moments of necessary
qualitative transitions, to organize, implement and control them, to control chaotic
manifestations caused by technological leaps in order to stabilize the system, to eliminate
the effects of negative random factors, etc by solely focusing on the knowledge (Gluzitskiy,
2017).
As it was mentioned before (see 2.1. Definition of Knowledge), a distinction between the
information and the knowledge should be emphasized: "information becomes knowledge
only when it is purposefully used by an individual or collective. In other words, to become
knowledge, information must be meaningful and contextualized in a particular social and
cultural environment" (Gluzitskiy, 2017, p.101). He also highlights characteristics of the
knowledge-based economy:


the concept of knowledge serves as a resource – knowledge becomes a key growth factor
alongside with the labor and capital;



the concept of knowledge serves as a product – creation and production of knowledge
determines the image of the modern economy;



the concept of codified knowledge – it is a key component of the economic relations;



the knowledge is based on the development of the information and communication
technologies (ICT) – the knowledge economy is a result of the information society’s
heyday (Gluzitskiy, 2017)

Regarding the effect of scale, in a traditional economy, an increase in the scale of production
leads to a production costs decrease; however, the costs of complex production processes
increase. Therefore, the optimal size of an enterprise is set. On the contrary, the knowledge
economy defines the other conditions: the more knowledge is used, the higher the efficiency
of the organization is; thus, it creates more opportunities for the growth of the
intellectualization of production processes (Gluzitskiy, 2017). The economies of scale in a
knowledge economy are characterized by increasing marginal utility and increased
productivity. Moreover, the competitiveness of an enterprise correlates with the knowledge
management – the shorter the time interval between the conceiving of an idea (personal

34

Mariia Pokryshkina

knowledge) and its materialization, the more efficiently the knowledge management is
applied in this enterprise, thus, the better the human potential of the enterprise is
implemented.
Technological progress inevitably releases labor from the manufacturing sector. It leads to
the labor transition from the area of tangible production to the intangible area. As a result,
"living labor" is saved by the development of the production forces, resulting in the social
wealth growth, higher living standards, leisure time increase, promoting personal growth. A
society is not burdened with physical labor, it is focused on the generation of new ideas and
knowledge creation instead. Such a trend is demonstrated by the fast growth of investment
into the knowledge: in the countries – members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) – an average of 3.4% per year against 2.2% (fixed
assets) (Gluzitskiy, 2017; Pogorelova, 2011).
According to Morkovkin (2013), the key prerequisites for the formation and development of
the knowledge economy are:


Knowledge transformation into the production factor along with the capital, labor

and natural resources;


Increasing proportion of the services and fast growth of the intellectually intensive

services for businesses;


High importance of the education investments and human capital; high-qualified

personnel training;


Development and the large-scale use of new information and communication

technologies;


Transformation of the innovation into the main source of the economic growth;



Reinforcing the competitiveness of the enterprises, regions and national economies

However, despite being a common good, knowledge is becoming a powerful marketing
instrument. "The knowledge economy is market-driven and performs according to a market
ideology, which stands in a problematic but not necessarily conflicting relation to the norms
and ideals of the knowledge society" (Sörlin & Vessuri, 2007, p. 2). According to Sörlin and

35

Mariia Pokryshkina

Vessuri, there are several discrepancies and certain contradictions regarding the "knowledge
economy" and "knowledge society". While globalization processes reveal the need for the
intellectual resources, knowledge-intensive concepts and skilled labor, the polar perceptions
of the knowledge are still "being embedded in an extremely complex reality" (Sörlin &
Vessuri, 2007).
2.5. Knowledge management
Nowadays, in the era of modern technologies, it is impossible to imagine an organization
which is not willing to strive for the self-development and for raising its own
competitiveness. The pace of the modern business world dictates the new rules and creates
a specific knowledge-intensive environment where being successful equals to being able to
manage the existing knowledge.
The concept of knowledge in the organizations has attracted attention across the academic
literature for several decades, therefore the concept is known for the academics (Alvesson
& Karreman, 2001; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Spender & Grant, 1996). According to Ipe
(2003), knowledge as an inherent organizational factor has also been considered as a main
source of competitive advantage (Stewart, 1997) and "critical to the long-term sustainability
and success of organizations"(Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995). Thanks to the knowledge
recognition in the modern organizations – it promotes the creation, sharing and utilization of
knowledge on both individual and collective levels (Becerra-Fernandez & Sabherwal, 2001;
Drucker, 1993, as cited in Ipe, 2003).
Knowledge management (KM) has become a popular practice due to the necessity of the
knowledge workers to share and to convey their embedded skills or experiences. Therefore,
the employees own a great internal potential which needs to be revealed in the most efficient
way. The concept of the knowledge management may be viewed from the different
perspectives. KM is a multidisciplinary subject which covers a broad diversity of fields.
According to Alvesson and Karreman (2001), knowledge management is an umbrella term
for a broad spectrum of fields: information systems, organizational learning and strategic
management and innovation. Although this concept is appealing and seems significant on

36

Mariia Pokryshkina

the broad scale, it is, however, quite often it is diffuse and ambiguous in terms of
classification. Thus, troubles with sticking to one specific category of "knowledge" or
"management" lead to the following paradox – "the more management, the less knowledge
"to manage", and the more "knowledge matters, the less space there is for management to
make a difference" (Alvesson and Karreman, 2001, p. 996). Undoubtedly, knowledge
management is a valuable tool of guiding the intellectual capital in every company.
According to Dalkir (2001), knowledge management was initially defined as the process of
applying a systematic approach to the capture, structuring, management, and dissemination
of knowledge throughout an organization to work faster, reuse best practices, and reduce
costly rework from project to project (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Pasternack & Viscio 1998;
Pfeffer & Sutton, 1999; Ruggles & Holtshouse, 1999).
Knowledge management is also known as a systematic, goal-oriented application of
measures to steer and control the tangible and intangible knowledge assets of organizations.
Knowledge management aims to use the existing knowledge inside and outside of the
organizations to enable the creation of new knowledge, and generate value, innovation and
improvement out of it (Wunram, 2000). Knowing how to organize the knowledge flow, an
organization can improve the quality of solutions generated, increase the general
productivity and enlarge the amount of the fields of practice. In addition, the unique feature
of knowledge as a resource means that it can become obsolete in the future. Therefore, new
knowledge has to be created continuously (Ichijo & Nonaka, 2006). However, it is important
to control the quality of knowledge and information acquired and disseminated within the
organizations. Knowledge has to be relevant - not all kinds of knowledge might be applicable
and useful for the company. All circulating data has to be accurate, relevant and preferably
recent in order to stay competitive. Furthermore, companies need to educate the top
management and KM executives on how to manage knowledge strategically in order to
achieve positive results. It is essential for the managers to be encouraged to share their
knowledge in an effective way and implement ad hoc methods for the better knowledge
conversion within the company.

Knowledge management represents a deliberate and systematic approach to ensure the full
utilization of the organization’s knowledge base, coupled with the potential of individual
skills, competencies, thoughts, innovations, and ideas to create a more efficient and effective
organization (Dalkir 2011). The companies tend to focus more on the intellectual capital
which contributes to the business growth as it represents a valuable asset. Such competencies
and expertise in various fields bring intangible profit to an organization which resides in its
personnel and can be retrieved through the various practices. It is essential to identify the
knowledge that is of value and is also at risk of being lost to the organization, through
retirement, turnover, and competition using the intellectual capital or asset approach (Dalkir,
2011). In other words, in order to manipulate and elaborate the knowledge management
techniques, it is vital to define the existing knowledge which a company owns or needs and
to create an environment which is directed at stimulating the knowledge flow and knowledge
retention within a certain organization.
2.6. Knowledge sharing
"We experience work as a human, social activity that engages the same social needs and
responses as the other parts of our lives: the need for connection and cooperation, support
and trust, a sense of belonging, fairness, and recognition" (Cohen & Prusak, 2001, p. x). We
all receive everyday information through the knowledge sharing practices: morning news,
chat with a friend, workshop at the office or an evening cooking course – we expand our
knowledge day by day. Thus, the ultimate goal of the knowledge sharing is an asset
accumulation. Consciously or unconsciously people get involved in the knowledge sharing
process in all spheres of their lives.
This master’s thesis focuses on the organizational knowledge sharing – how knowledge is
created and transmitted among employees inside a firm or a company. Companies can be
seen as social communities which are creating, sharing and transferring explicit and tacit
knowledge (Chow & Chan, 2008). Thus, motivational aspect (incentive rewards, trust,
relationships of behavior regarding socio-cognitive approaches plays an important role in
promoting knowledge sharing in a company.

Several studies based on the theory of reasoned action (TRA) showed that volition and
leadership affect the success of an organization (Chow & Chan, 2008). The theory of
reasoned action is a social psychology model which illustrates and explains the links between
human beliefs, norms, intentions, behaviors and attitudes (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).
According to Fishbein and Ajzen, TRA suggests that the human behavior is mediated by the
attitude an individual develops based on the intention to engage in the certain behavior (Chow
& Chan, 2008; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). Moreover, an individual is more likely to perform
the behavior if the subjective norm is higher. Also, individual is more likely to perform a
behavior if the intention to engage in it is strong (Chow & Chan, 2008; Fishbein & Ajzen,
1975). TRA is often used to identify differences in the knowledge-sharing behavior – a study
by Bock and Kim revealed that the attitude towards the knowledge sharing and subjective
norms positively affects the knowledge-sharing behavior (Norfadzilah, Faizuniah, Md
Lazim, Noor & Nini, 2016).
Moreover, an impetus towards the organizational knowledge sharing can be communicated
through the extrinsic rewards, anticipated reciprocal relationships, a sense of self-worth, and
a favorable organizational climate (Chow & Chan, 2008). Wong, Wong, Hui & Law (2001)
claim that organizational knowledge is generated provided that the long-term positive
relationship between employees is established (as cited in Chow & Chan, 2008).
In his book Knowledge Sharing, Smith (2005) mentions the importance of the networks in
the workplace – dynamic interaction promotes the new business approaches, adds agility to
the organizational flow, therefore, organizations become more customer-oriented and are
able to meet the needs of their clients, more efficiently utilizing information and knowledge
management (Stewart, 2001 as cited in Smith, 2005).
Another aspect which defines the knowledge sharing in organizations is collaboration – in
the knowledge intensive firms, collaboration is taken into consideration, yet, it has to be
well-managed in order to add and to create more value to the company (Smith, 2005).
Furthermore, according to Bob Buckman (2004), the concepts of cooperation and
collaboration should be distinguished– the former means to work together in an enjoyable
way, whereas collaboration is related to empathy (as cited in Smith, 2005).

2.7. Knowledge sharing and its impact on the firm's competitiveness
Ubiquitous knowledge management referencing in the context of business environment and
organizational culture creates an assumption that companies can increase their competitive
advantage by managing their knowledge (Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012). While this
subject has been topical for already several decades, the gap in the research whether the
knowledge sharing truly makes an impact on the organizational performance still exists
(Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012). Although several empirical studies (Darroch, 2005;
Gloet & Terziovski 2004; Kianto, 2011; Lee & Choi, 2003; Marque ́s & Simo ́n, 2006;
Tanriverdi, 2005; Zack et al, 2009, as cited in Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012) indicate
that the knowledge management somehow influences a company’s performance, there is
still no consensus in the literature regarding its direct or indirect (mediated by specific
variables) effect on the competitiveness level.
According to Schiuma, Andreeva and Kianto (2012), there is no single interpretation and
measurement of the performance itself across the existing studies: it varies from the
innovativeness (Darroch and McNaughton, 2003; Gloet and Terziovski, 2004; Kianto, 2011;
Kiessling et al, 2009;) with employee and product improvement (Kiessling et al., 2009) to
the product leadership, customer intimacy and operational excellence (Zack et al., 2009) and
competitive position (Lee and Choi, 2003, as cited in Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012).
However, several studies have reflected the financial side of the knowledge sharing
(Darroch, 2005; Marque ́s and Simo ́n, 2006; Tanriverdi, 2005; Zack et al., 2009, as cited in
Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012). Moreover, the focus on the knowledge processes
prevails over the knowledge management practices (Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012).
Thus, there is a lack of information for the managers regarding the ways of improving
company's performance via more efficient knowledge management methods. Mixing the
knowledge processes and the knowledge management practices prevents practitioners from
obtaining relevant data on the organizational knowledge flow, hence, calling for more
research in the KM field (Foss et al., 2010). In line with this argument, the emerging
knowledge governance approach highlights the lack of studies about the formal organization
from the KM perspective and requires deeper understanding of this field (Darroch, 2005;
Foss et al., 2010; Zack et al., 2009, as cited in Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012).

40

Mariia Pokryshkina

The study of Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto (2012) intends to bridge the gap between KM
practices and their impact on firms’ competitiveness and financial performance. The study
was conducted based on collected data from 3 different countries: Russia, Finland and China.
The selected companies represented production, service and industrial sectors with different
growth rates. The results of the study have revealed that KM really affects the firm's
performance, acknowledging theoretical assumptions about the importance of KM for
competitiveness of firms (e.g. Davenport and Prusak, 1998; Edvinsson and Malone, 1997;
Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995, as cited in Schiuma, Andreeva & Kianto, 2012).
The link between company’s success and its competitive advantage was mentioned by
Carneiro (2000) – knowledge on customers' attitudes, competitor’s analysis (e.g.
weaknesses, strengths and movements of firm’s direct competitors) (Curren et al., 1992, as
cited in Carneiro, 2000) and product perception on the market may promote higher
performance. Therefore, organizations should take advantage of the innovation, IT,
competitor’s failure analysis, and they should also invest into the knowledge management
systems and knowledge-driven workforce (Carneiro, 2000). Effective managers have to
perceive KM as a strategic tool – not only does it create opportunities for the new solutions,
but it also helps to formulate alternative business strategies (Carneiro, 2000). Moreover, top
management should maintain organizational learning through the organizational learning
systems ‘creation (Coopey, 1995; Sinkula, 1994; Senge, 1990, as cited in Carneiro, 2000).
Being actively involved into the learning process, workers are more likely to generate new
knowledge which can potentially increase competitive advantage of the business.

Chapter 3: Conceptualization of Knowledge Sharing in the
Russian context
3.1. Emerging economy of Russia
"Emerging economies are low-income, rapid-growth countries using economic liberalization
as their primary engine of growth. They fall into two groups: developing countries in Asia,
Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East and transition economies in the former Soviet
Union and China" (Looney 2014, Foreword, xxxv). Looney (2015, p. 3) says " these
countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) appeared to have the best prospects in the
developing world for high sustained rates of growth”. The choice of Russia as a focus
country is due to the recent shift towards the more liberal, more open economy and marketfriendly path. As an emerging economy and part of the BRIC association, Russia has recently
been showing economic development forming a platform for the cultivation of the modern,
Western-oriented management style (Looney 2014; O'Neil, 2011). Moreover, having a large
population combined with the cheap labor market leads to the increasing untapped potential.
However, Hanson (as cited in Looney 2014, p. 4) claims that Russia is being atypical
emerging economy, "upper-middle-income country with many of the attributes of modernity
with deep-seated economic problems as well". The prevalent resource scarcity combined
with the cultural specificity and a long-term economic isolation had an impact on the sociocultural status quo. Therefore, Russia has a unique scenario of implementing innovation in
terms of organizational management. Furthermore, the gradual change of the vector of the
Russian economy allowed to focus on the innovation, involving more of the intellectual
resources, emerging new types of management (Vertakova & Plotnikov, 2016).
The growing political, economic, social and environmental instability in the world indicates
that in the upcoming decades the companies will be focusing more on the knowledge which
can stimulate the development of the human society (Gluzitskiy, 2017). Moreover, based on
the current globalization of socio-economic development, prosperity and power of the nation
could be determined by the level of knowledge owned and used (Gluzitskiy, 2017).

42

Mariia Pokryshkina

According to the World Bank Report (2017), the estimated total wealth distribution in Russia
looks as following: human capital – 46%; produced capital – 33%; natural capital – 20% (of
which 15% are non-renewable sources, 5% are renewable) and net foreign assets – 1%
(Sanghi, Lange, Esther, Emelyanova, Nemova & Rostovtseva, 2017). Thus, human capital
accounts for the largest share of wealth in Russia. In comparison, in the OECD countries
human capital accounts for 70% of the total wealth structure. Between 2000 and 2017,
Russia’s human capital wealth per capita grew rapidly at 80%, compared to the overall wealth
per capita growth of 76% but during the past ten years this growth has slowed down. More
precisely, it slowed from 4.7% during 2000–2010 to 1.8% during 2010-2017. If human
capital rate grew at its 2000–2017 average of 3.5%, it would still take about 50 years to reach
the OECD countries’ level and the rate of 1.8 % would take Russia around 100 years to reach
the OECD level (Sanghi et al, 2017). An interesting fact illustrated in the World Bank Report:
although the share of human capital in Russia's total wealth is significantly lower than in the
OECD countries, the education indicators in Russia appear to show the same or even a higher
level than the indicators in OECD countries (Sanghi et al, 2017). Moreover, the share of the
workforce with higher education in Russia is greater than in the OECD countries, however
the quality of education, measured using the standard tests, corresponds with the OECD level.
Generally, the human capital in Russia is highly affected by the insufficient federal funding.
Pointing out the draft budget for the 2020-2022, the economists from the Higher School of
Economics (Moscow), RANEPA, the Institute of the Economic Policy named after N.I.
Gaidar and the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation state
that the share of the budget expenditures on education will decrease from 3.8% of GDP in
2020 to 3.6% in 2022, and health care expenditures will account for 3.6% of GDP in 2020
and 3.4% - in 2022 (Sanghi et al, 2017). Such an unpromising forecast leads to the conclusion
that the uneven economic development, poor financing of education, health care system and
infrastructure, and unequal distribution of resources are the great counter-factors affecting
the KM. The World Bank suggests the following measures in order to increase the share and
the returns on the stock of the human capital in Russia:


to expand the university education potential;



to improve the quality of the Russian system of vocational;
43

Mariia Pokryshkina



to improve the students’soft skills – collective problem solving, communication
competencies and creativity;



to improve the role of the primary health care including diagnosis, prevention and
disease management in order to decrease the expensive treatment needed at later
stages;



to improve efficiency and to increase the healthcare funding through the treatment
protocols implementation based on the evidence-based medicine principles and
quality control systems; to optimize the hospital excess infrastructure and to increase
the more active usage of information technology (Sanghi et al, 2017)

According to Ershova and Androsova (2014) the strategy of the innovative development of
Russia until 2020 implies a transition from a raw material to a knowledgeable (innovative)
economy which is formed by the intellectual property market, innovative systems and
innovative personnel. It is crucial to constantly implement the innovative products and the
use of knowledge in the activities of an enterprise.
As companies see the untapped potential in their employees, they need to facilitate
continuous learning and knowledge sharing among their staff. Knowledge as a single whole
is being embedded in every single employee, thus, in order to use this potential, managers
should be educated in the knowledge management field. Such skills allow to extract, apply
and transfer the knowledge. Furthermore, providing an open work environment and space
for communication, companies contribute to the further learning initiatives, creativity and
work-related problem solving based on skills, experiences and abilities of their personnel.
Such positive outcomes support the development of the knowledge management in the
enterprises. However, despite the positive dynamics of the knowledge management usage in
big corporations, there are various obstacles that hinder the implementation of the knowledge
management in smaller organizations in Russia (Ershova & Androsova, 2014).
One of the ways to receive the information regarding the KM performance in the
organization is to conduct an empirical research among the employees of a certain company.

44

Mariia Pokryshkina

As an example, a questionnaire was conducted in the Russian consulting company by its
quality manager Balashov E. in 2013 (Ershova & Androsova, 2014). The research has
indicated the existence of the issues regarding the implementation of the knowledge
management systems. The study has showed that 60% of respondents consider the lack of
time to implement the knowledge management as the main obstacle, 46% note a lack of
understanding of the role of the knowledge management by the organization’s top
management; 45% of the respondents gave preference to an individual work as compared to
a teamwork (Figure 3). Summarizing the identified obstacles towards the implementation of
the knowledge management in the Russian companies, it is easy to highlight the main
problem – the lack of the top management conviction and, as a result, the lack of
understanding the role of the knowledge management in the overall organizational strategy
(Ershova & Androsova, 2014).

Figure 3: Obstacles in the implementation of knowledge management in Russian
companies
Note: 60% – lack of time; 54% – organizational structure imperfection; 46% – lack of credibility of top
management; 44% – lack of reward; 45% – individual work priority over teamwork.

From an organizational point of view, Russian organizational culture tends to highly
resemble Eastern European culture, however, being an antipode to Scandinavian culture
(Jarjabka, 2014). Based on the research done by GLOBE, Hofstede, Trompenaars and

45

Mariia Pokryshkina

Hampden-Turner, Jarjabka (2014) provides a comparative analysis of the organizational
culture of Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia). A Hofstede
Model, which uses five cultural dimensions to differentiate the four different organizational
cultures (Hofstede 1980, 1991, 1998) allows to discover several cultural differences and
similarities among Central and Eastern European countries (Jarjabka, 2014). Speaking about
Russia, a high Bulgarian-Romanian-Russian cultural similarity is presented in the research.

Figure 4. Comparison of the national-organizational cultural dimension indices of
Bulgaria, Romania and Russia
Note: source: The Hofstede Centre 2009, as cited in Jarjabka, 2014.

The relatively identical indices of the power distance, individualism-collectivism,
masculinity-femininity and uncertainty avoidance mark that these cultures show a great
resemblance. It can be explained from the geographical point of view as well as through
historical roots – Greek - Eastern Orthodox religion (Taylor, 2003, as cited in Jarjabka,
2014).
However, the study revealed Estonian-Finnish similarity and Estonian-Russian differences
(Figure 5). Estonian cultural indices appear to be closer to the Finnish cultural indices than
the Russian ones (Maaja, 2004, as cited in Jarjabka 2014). This is due to the Scandinavian
46

Mariia Pokryshkina

"value system" – cultural connection is not only accounted for the geographical reasons, but
it is also supported by Hofstede’s dimension model: Estonia belongs to the "sensitive cultural
cluster" alongside with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland (Jarjabka, 2003; Jarjabka,
2014). The following culture group is described as being sensitive in terms their national and
organizational behavior and quite low power distance. "Despite spending several decades as
one country with Russia, despite all attempts of assimilation, and despite the Russian
minority residing in the area, not the slightest bit of similarity can be seen among the Russian
and Estonian culture" (Jarjabka, 2014). Furthermore, Jarjabka reminds that all post-socialist
countries should not be attributed to the same group without a proper research.

Figure 5. Comparison of the dimension indices of Estonian, Finnish and Russian culture

3.2. Knowledge management in Russia
All these mentioned above inhibitory factors have a direct impact on the general
management style in the organizations in Russia. Speaking about a modern management,
many researches emphasize the importance of the human resources, since it is the person
who has the principal role in the sustainable development of an organization. In other words,
human capital is a central element of any management processes (Vertakova & Plotnikov,
2016). As a consequence, knowledge shared between individuals becomes one of the most
important assets, therefore, it leads to a competitive advantage.

47

Mariia Pokryshkina

Russian scientists A.L. Gaponenko and T. M. Orlova (2008) have identified seven basic
knowledge management strategies, which depend on certain elements of the intellectual
capital (client, human, or structural) the company focuses on:
1) the creation and use of knowledge within the framework of human capital (to answer the
questions: “How do employees exchange the knowledge within an organization?”, “To
which extent does their competence increase and how is it used in relation to the
competitiveness' growth of an organization?”);
2) the creation and use of knowledge within the framework of organizational capital (focus
on explicit knowledge, such as patents, copyrights, databases, etc.);
3) the creation and use of knowledge in the external relations of the company, primarily with
the customers (based on the marketing technologies);
4) interaction between the human and the client capital (improving the individual expertise
of employees through the interaction with clients);
5) interaction between the structural and the human capital (to answer the question: “How
does the individual expertise of personnel contribute to the elements' formation in relation
to the internal structure of an organization?", "How can individual expertise be improved
through the usage of the internal structure elements?”)
6) focus on the knowledge transfer from the interaction with the external counterparties of
an organization to the internal systems and ensuring its intensive usage between employees;
7) the knowledge flow between all elements of the intellectual capital.
Thus, knowledge management is one of the main tools for ensuring the strategic
competitiveness of an organization. In order to effectively implement this concept, an

48

Mariia Pokryshkina

integrated approach is essential to provide the activation of all basic management functions
(planning, organization, motivation and control). These functions will help to eliminate the
current obstacles and contradictions regarding the knowledge management, and they will
contribute to a long-term sustainable development of the individual economic entities and
also of the economy in general (Kharitonova, 2013).
Polyanin (2016) highlights several features of the current organizational management in
Russia: high scientific potential, originality of organizational culture, technological
management approach, traditions of the economic governance by the state and complex
regional and political aspects. Moreover, he claims that Russian managers suffer from their
wrong authority delegation to the employees, and therefore it aggravates the workflow. The
lack of attention to the corporate culture also has an impact on the internal knowledge sharing
processes. Furthermore, the deficit of the ICT and low technological literacy in Russian
companies indicates the inability to conduct successful information acquisition and thus, the
knowledge sharing inside the company. However, the modern rapid development of ICT has
affected the socio-psychological component of the knowledge management. The transition
from the internal communication between employees to the usage of various messengers and
other software lead to the fact that, the on-site activities have been replaced by virtual ones
(Vertakova & Plotnikov, 2016).
According to Larionov (2017), the knowledge-based economy is the natural result of the
scientific and technological progress which is conducive to the growth of the role of the
knowledge and information in creating "wealth". The main features of the knowledge-based
economy are:


knowledge is the production factor;



information is the key resource;



the main component of the competitive advantage is creativeness and intellectual
ability of a person;



the percentage of the knowledge workers is increasing among the workforce;



all activities in the organizations are held based on the continuous knowledge sharing

49

Mariia Pokryshkina

Thus, the knowledge and information resources are highly valued professionally wise, as
well as the ability to manage them. The proper knowledge management is one of the keyways
to succeed in a business perspective as it is a source of intellectual capital in every company.
3.3. Knowledge sharing in Russia
In the knowledge economy, organizational knowledge exchange between a group of
employees is a key to the effective joint activities and problem solving. It is based on a set
of individual, group and corporate ideas about the company and employees, on their
collective collaboration, originating from the company background and its history
(Hodgkinson & Sparrow, 2007; Smalla & Sage, 2006, as cited in Nestik, 2014).
According to Kasavin (2001), knowledge is not only a setting of experience in social
memory or a transformation of experience into awareness through its structuring, but it is
also a method of transforming awareness, endowing new meaning to performance and
communication (Nestik, 2014). Moreover, as knowledge has a social nature, it is represented
by the socially significant processes and entities. (Zhuravlev & Nestik, 2010a, 2010b, 2011,
2012, as cited in Nestik, 2014).
Nestik (2014) suggests that there are several groups of psychological factors of knowledge
sharing in the organizations: individual and socio-psychological factors of person,
interpersonal, group, intergroup and societal. Individual psychological factors, states Nestik
(2014), can influence the knowledge generation and its transfer. It is the employees, who
affect the knowledge generation process through their various interests, willingness to solve
complex problems, low uncertainty avoidance, risk tendency, persistency and selfconfidence (Oldham & Cummings, 1996, as cited in Nestik, 2014), openness to new
experience (King, 1996; McCrae, 1987, as cited in Nestik, 2014). Personal qualities and
learning styles are also important in terms of organizational knowledge sharing (Armstrong
& Mahmud, 2004, as cited in Nestik, 2014).
According to Nestik (2014), there have been conducted several domestic (in Russia) and
foreign studies which have thrown the light on the following socio-psychological (personal)

50

Mariia Pokryshkina

factors of the organizational knowledge sharing: self-efficacy, machiavellianism, value
orientations, level of basic trust and strength of organizational identity (Cabrera, 2006;
Gagné, 2009; He, Fang & Wei , 2009; Kuo & Young, 2008; Liu, 2008; Nestik, 2009;
Zhuravlev, 2010; Zhuravlev & Nestik, 2010a, 2010b, 2011). The studies he has conducted
showed the relationship between the knowledge exchange readiness and the individual value
orientations (goodwill, universalism, achievement, conformance and independence).
Furthermore, the results have also confirmed the relation with the emotional intelligence, the
individual perception of a person's own past, basic trust in people and organizational identity
(Nestik, 2009).
Speaking about the interpersonal factors of the knowledge management effectiveness, Nestik
(2014) claims that there is no sufficient research in relation with it. However, these factors
include the level of interpersonal trust, the degree of employees' awareness of each other's
knowledge, the intensity of contacts, common views and experience (Cross & Parker, 2006;
Kilduff & Krackhardt, 2008; Zhuravlev, Nestik & Nikitenko, 2009 as cited in Nestik, 2014).
The group factors of the knowledge sharing comprise the level of trust in the team, the level
of a group reflexivity, the top management attitude towards the knowledge sharing, the team
attitude towards the implementation of the knowledge management system, characteristics
of the communicative group structure, the group identity strength and organization's
commitment (Kuo & Young, 2008; ; Liu, 2008; Maurer, Bartsch & Ebers, 2011; Nestik et
al, 2009; Nestik, 2012, as cited in Nestik, 2014).
3.3.1. Knowledge sharing models in organizations in Russia
Nestik (2014) suggests that there are two knowledge sharing models which could be found
in Russian organizations: codification-oriented and personalization-oriented models.
The codification strategy is based on the intellectual capital accumulation within an
organization: a company uses IT for the data retrieval tools integration and it provides the
maintenance of the electronic knowledge databases. The advantage of such a strategy is the
"economies of scale" achievement through the knowledge "recycling" in large organizations

51

Mariia Pokryshkina

with vertical hierarchy. Such an approach leads to the innovation and creativity decrease;
however, it proves to be more reliable in terms of experience of the antecedent problem
solutions.
Codification is an investment-oriented strategy – companies have to invest into IT
infrastructure. It is also important to organize the information access in accordance with the
employee position and his/her functions. By encouraging employees to replenish and to
actively use the knowledge databases, companies are able to benefit from knowledge sharing
engagement (cost reduction, better business performance).
Codification is normally used when the automated management systems (ERP systems,
CRM systems) or electronic document management are being implemented in the
organizations. The main advantages of the codification knowledge sharing model are:


saving time on the paperwork;



document duplication avoidance;



administrative costs reduction;



paperwork and telecommunications costs reduction;



transportation costs reduction;



customer service costs reduction;



productivity growth (shorter education period, faster documentation access);



intellectual capital cost increase (intensive experience exchange, lower error rate, lower
loss regarding the specialists quitting the company, higher education programs'
efficiency)

The personalization knowledge sharing strategy is based on the personnel creativity
development and knowledge sharing facilitation. It is mostly suitable for the companies with
a matrix and project structures, who hold video conferences, use individual meetings and
electronic correspondence. Thus, as organizational knowledge sharing is based on the group
psychology and community mindset, the main focus of codification strategy is a project
teamwork and other kinds of internal networking aimed at problem solving based on the

52

Mariia Pokryshkina

common effort. Speaking about the reward system, workers benefit from the mutual
knowledge sharing and collaboration instead of solely codifying their knowledge into the
databases. Main characteristics of codification approach are all kinds of coaching and
mentoring, self-development at work, group creativity enhancement and effective
knowledge-sharing techniques. Furthermore, such a strategy is well-combined with
innovation solutions (Nestik, 2014).
3.3.2. Competitiveness and knowledge sharing in Russia
Among the KM practitioners and managers, knowledge sharing is viewed as an essential
antecedent to competitive advantage. Knowledge sharing is described as the process of
identifying, capturing, and leveraging the knowledge, know-how, and best practices within
an organization (Leonard, 1995; O’Dell & Grayson, 1998; von Krogh, 1998, as cited in
Husted & Michailova, 2002).
The ability to facilitate the knowledge sharing processes between employees, allows
companies to control knowledge duplication while producing it, aimed at the distribution of
the best practices via making the relevant information easily accessible regardless of where
it is obtained and stored originally in the organization. Furthermore, knowledge sharing
enables the knowledge creation which is a process including sharing tacit knowledge and
turning a part of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).
In their paper, Husted and Michailova (2002) state that there are factors that guarantee the
competitiveness of the company – present-oriented and future-oriented. Particularly, the
knowledge sharing belongs to present, whereas readiness for the experiments and access to
the external knowledge are related to the future success of the company. Owning a great pool
of resources, the businesses frequently do not recognize the "bulk of an iceberg" – they do
not see or use the untapped potential in the shape of hidden knowledge.
3.3.3. Challenges of knowledge sharing in the organizations in Russia
There are several challenges which modern organizations face in terms of the knowledge
management. “When employees walk out the door, they take valuable organizational

53

Mariia Pokryshkina

knowledge with them” (Lesser & Prusak 2001, p. 1). Being the most abundant source of
knowledge, many organizations continue to ignore the human factor. The problem is that
employees are not eager to share the information due to the several reasons: they do not want
to waste their time, they do not have any incentive, or they are afraid of losing their status.
Furthermore, the workers are worried that someone with whom they will share their
professional experience may take their position and they may end up losing their job.
Therefore, the task of the modern organization knowledge management is to make every
effort to eliminate the stereotypes that impede knowledge sharing, learning and to create a
corporate culture which supports knowledge dissemination.
The empirical research conducted by Nestik (2014) has revealed several obstacles that hinder
the knowledge sharing in Russian companies (Nestik, 2009, 2014; Zhuravlev & Nestik,
2010, 2012). These barriers are:
– the fear of employees being easily replaced if the knowledge is transferred;
– the fear of losing their significance as specialists;
– low team awareness of the company business and common goals;
– the process of knowledge sharing is hindered by the complex set of actions and approvals
which slow down the process;
– instead of the problem experience analysis, the responsible employees are blamed guilty;
– the fear of employees that their unique ideas will be stolen and appropriated by the others
Generally, the majority of issues which influence the quality of the knowledge sharing in
Russian organizations are related to a low level of trust within an organization and weak
corporate culture. Furthermore, the national culture determines the nature of the problems.
(Zhuravlev & Nestik, 2010, 2012; Nestik, 2014).
The studies also confirm that there is a strong correlation between the trust level in the
organization and readiness of the employees to share the knowledge. It appears that if mutual
trust is necessary for addressing the knowledge shared in the organization, then sharing one’s
experience and skills also requires a sense of belonging to the same community and to one

54

Mariia Pokryshkina

social group (Zhuravlev & Nestik, 2010, 2011a, 2011b; Zhuravlev, Nestik & Nikitenko,
2009, as cited in Nestik 2014).
Another study mentioned by Nestik (2014) has shown that the group trust plays a key role
in the corporate knowledge management system formation. It is based on the method of M.
Marquardt “Self-Learning Organization” (Marquardt, 2001) which was used to measure the
level of the knowledge management system development. Moreover, in order to measure the
internal trust level in the organization, the method of organizational trust by L. Huff and L.
Kelley was applied (2003). Nestik (2014) states that not all elements of the knowledge
management system appeared to be associated with the socio-psychological characteristics
of the groups. For example, the group trust level and group unity do not prove relations with
the performance-oriented electronic systems usage, distance education, customer
information exchange, launching innovation projects and employee training support.
Furthermore, the organizational trust level is tightly connected with the company's ability to
attract the external knowledge, to make the knowledge accessible and the quick "lessons
learned" based on the common experience.
The main output of the previous research indicates that most of the time, the effectiveness
of the organizational knowledge sharing in Russia is primarily defined by the sociopsychological aspects rather than by the IT infrastructure development (Nestik, 2014). Also,
Nestik (2014) emphasizes the significance of the group reflexivity – the aim is to help
employees to see their role in joint activities. As the knowledge sharing happens mostly on
the individual level (social exchange), the group is characterized by the group reflection
(Nestik, 2013, 2014). The main function of the latter is to prepare the groups for changes
and upcoming joint activities and to support a positive group identity (Zhuravlev & Nestik,
2011, 2012). The sense of belonging to the group allows a psychological exchange to take
place.
3.3.4. Knowledge-sharing hostility in Russia
According to Husted & Michailova (2002), the main problems and obstacles regarding the
sharing of knowledge in Russian organizations are "reinforced and perpetuated in the

55

Mariia Pokryshkina

Russian business culture and organizational realities" (p.19). As the management style is
based on the cultural peculiarities, and therefore directly affect the KM practices across the
businesses. The work of Husted and Michailova (2002) is built upon the contradiction
between Western companies and Russian companies. In comparison to the Western culture,
Russia (the former Soviet Union) has been isolated for a long period of time. This led to the
poor experience of collaboration, which causes problems in the "development of the
alliance" (p.19). Their study has revealed that the aim of Russian managers and workers tend
to accumulate knowledge but not to share it. Moreover, the knowledge is seen as an
individual power resource rather than a common good. Although Russian culture is normally
described as a collectivist culture (Bollinger, 1994; Garrison & Artemyev,1994; Hofstede,
1984; Smith, 1990, as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002), Russian managers show
unwillingness to share the knowledge inside an organization, which contradicts with
collectivist nature.
Furthermore, Husted and Michailova (2002) state that, according to Lawrence and
Vlachoutsicos (1990, p. 282), “Russian managers do not share information with outsiders
without a clear explicit instruction” and “they rarely volunteer information”. The lack of
incentives for sharing knowledge is due to the strong belief that their future career directly
depends on the amount of knowledge they possess, which has to be protected from the others
in order to eliminate the personal competitive advantage loss. Husted and Michailova (2002)
illustrate this statement with a very distinctive example – Russian people collect as many
diplomas as they can from attending various courses or trainings. But the most curious
observation is that they demonstrate these papers in the most visible ways in the office
premises. However, when it comes to the working seminars or teamwork with colleagues,
Russians are opposed to present their knowledge unless it gives them a career growth
opportunity. The biggest discrepancy is that although obtaining a diploma is a powerful
stimulus for the workers to participate in such activities, it is still stronger than the received
knowledge and the learning outcome.
Another problem in Russian companies which Husted and Michailova (2002) have described
is so-called departmental way of thinking and acting. In the scope of the various departments

56

Mariia Pokryshkina

within one company it is essential to communicate and to share the knowledge between the
divisions in order to "make use of the full body of their knowledge". Most of the time,
departments exist in parallel, only being oriented towards their own goals, not attributing
themselves to the company as a single whole. As the functions and responsibilities of the
employees are strictly distributed, workers are not motivated to raise the cross-boundary
questions. Furthermore, they might be subjected to lose their job, or this will be ignored due
to the absence of interest among the managers. In this case the performance and competitive
advantage of the firm are neglected because the management is solely focused on the internal
issues.
Speaking about the working process, Husted and Michailova (2002) mention the fear of
making and admitting mistakes. According to their research, voicing problems and
discussing mistakes are taboo in organizations in Russia. Not seeing mistakes as a learning
resource, Russian employees are often playing the role of "executors" – they fulfil tasks
according to already prescribed plan, not paying attention to the process. Neither do Russian
employees like to reflect on their decision-making process, being highly convinced that "we
are here to learn, not to discuss our problems" (Hibbert, 1990, as cited in Husted &
Michailova, 2002). By eliminating the possibility to make any mistake, Russian companies
neglect sharing the most valuable knowledge – experience. Generally, the managers stick to
the tactics of not acting, and, therefore, not making mistakes. Moreover, Russians find any
kind of problem discussion confusing and they try to avoid it (Michailova & Anisimova,
1999, as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002). The reluctance towards an open discussion
finds its roots in "coercive bureaucracy" (Adler, 1999, as cited in Husted & Michailova,
2002), which is quite exemplary for Russian organizations. According to the researchers, it
is caused by the authority control, top-down command approach and autocratic strategy
development. Husted and Michailova also add the lack of reflection and the absence of the
feedback as such. Thus, such a strict hierarchy dictates unquestioning obedience and
impedes the knowledge sharing process. Pondering the lessons learned is essential for the
better understanding on how to eliminate the problems in the future and how to avoid
repeating mistakes.

57

Mariia Pokryshkina

Other challenges that Husted and Michilova (2002) mention are related to the "knowledgereceivers". Firstly, they introduce the “not-invented-here” (NIH) syndrome (Katz & Allen,
1982, as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002), which is characterized by resisting to accept
and doubting in the knowledge sources created outside the company. Russian employees
tend to avoid heterogeneous knowledge because, according to the research, creation of the
new knowledge has more prestige. As an example, Husted and Michailova (2002) describe
a management team in a Russian organization who are confident that they have monopolized
the knowledge in their professional field and, therefore, they do not accept ideas elsewhere
(Katz & Allen, 1982, as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002). Furthermore, there are two
factors which strengthen the NIH-syndrome: 1) strong group connection and mistrust
towards the knowledge owned by the foreigners; 2) mistrust towards the knowledge owned
by foreigners especially in terms of its applicability in the Russian context. The first factor
refers to the fact that Russian culture is collectivist and people tend to develop strong
relationships within the group. Thus, the employees show resistance towards any novelty, as
they think it might endanger the sense of familiarity, stability, organizational hierarchy and
continuity. The second factor demonstrates the risk averse behavior – by escaping the new
knowledge, Russian workers justify and keep the status quo (Husted & Michailova, 2002).
Another problem which Russian organizations face is the lack of absorption capacity
(Husted & Michailova, 2002). The notion has been introduced by Cohen and Levinthal
(1990) which refers to the knowledge usage ability. Such capacity is "based on the presence
of prior related knowledge" (Husted & Michailova, 2002). An empirical study by Szulanski
(1996) on the organizational knowledge transfer has shown that knowledge transfer is lower
in the organizations where knowledge recipients are tightly connected with the knowledge
source which blocks the unlearning of prior knowledge.
Primacy of the hierarchical status is also a serious obstacle in terms of the organizational
knowledge sharing in Russia. Strict hierarchy and formal status are the biggest barriers – top
managers in Russian firms do not tolerate learning from lower level employees and become
displeased when they are forced to work in the same group. Welsh, Luthans & Sommer
(1993) have concluded that "participative intervention seemed to have a counterproductive

58

Mariia Pokryshkina

effect on the Russian workers’ performance" and that "participative efforts threatened the
Russian cultural value of communal work" (as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002). Welsh
has particularly pointed out (1993):
By deliberately holding back, Russian workers could avoid the frustration of being rejected
or ignored. In addition, by not truly participating or giving meaningful suggestions in front
of outsiders, the workers would not put themselves in the position of expressing problems
inhibiting performance, comments they may have feared would be received as complaints
regarding co-workers. (p. 74).
On top of that, another study of 25 different organizations in St. Petersburg by Longenecker
& Popovski (1994. p.38) showed that the biggest problem was "lack of employee
involvement and motivation" (as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002). Companies need to
educate the top management and KM executives on how to manage knowledge strategically
in order to achieve positive results. It is essential for the managers to be encouraged to share
their knowledge in an effective way and implement ad hoc methods for the better knowledge
conversion within the company.
3.4 Competitiveness factors in Russia
Nowadays, the competitiveness level of the enterprises has raised on the global level due to
the growing amount of companies and businesses. Competitiveness is one of the key
macroeconomic indicators that demonstrate the status quo and the development prospects of
a country's economic system, and that determines its position in the international system of
labor division (Malygin & Sheiko, 2018). In other words, it is the ability to produce goods
which can meet the requirements of the world market in conditions of a free competitive
market (Kudryashov, 2013, as cited in Malygin & Sheiko, 2018). They mention that in 2016
Russia ranked 45th out of 140 according to the global competitiveness index developed by
the World Economic Forum. Therefore, there is a need for focusing on the knowledgeintensive workers and companies rather than being oriented on the export-raw material
model of the economic development which Russia is famous for. On the international scale,
Russia has traditionally been ascribed to the group of the developing countries characterized

59

Mariia Pokryshkina

by a high political and economic instability, poor investment climate and extremely high
risks of leading a business activity.
The fundamental problem of the modern knowledge economy is how to survive in the
oversaturated market environment. The solution of the latter directly affects the
manufacturing quality, profitability of the enterprises, adaptation to the current market
conditions and the successive economic growth. At the moment, there is a significant leap
in competition on the Russian market, and therefore, at this stage of development, there is a
high demand for ground alterations developments aimed at enhancing the competitiveness
of businesses in Russia (Polkina & Sukhoruchkin, 2016).
The competitiveness of an enterprise is based on the thoroughly defined competitive
advantage strategies and its corporate culture. Companies are more successful and stable on
the market when they have full control over their competitive advantage. Knowledge has
always been linked to the competitive advantage due to its high economic power. In modern
literature, the concept of the knowledge management is viewed as a new managerial function
which consists of a “systematic and targeted creation, updating and application of knowledge
to maximize the effectiveness of the company and the profit from knowledge-based assets''
(Khamatnurova & Guzhavina, 2013, p.3). On the part of the management, knowledge
management is seen as one of the most effective tools of the personnel development system,
moreover, goal-oriented personnel management promotes effective use of corporate
knowledge. Thus, the chances to increase the competitiveness level are growing.
Lee, Tun-Lee Foo, Leong and Ooi, K-B. (2016) in their work refer to Drucker (1995) who
claimed that the most vital economic resource for achieving a competitive advantage is
knowledge. Mentioning the collective knowledge, Lee et al. say that it resides in the minds
of personnel and is the most important resource which guarantees a stable growth of a
company. Furthermore, it is more important than such traditional factors of production as
labor, land or capital (Grossman, 2006, as cited in Lee et al., 2016). However, it is not enough
being solely oriented on maintaining a high competitiveness level, it may prove to be
ineffective due to a highly volatile and dynamic economic environment. There is always a

60

Mariia Pokryshkina

high chance of being copied by the competitors: stealing the original idea, substitution of the
product, or any kind of fraud the company may face. Thus, the enterprises should implement
innovation strategies and focus on the business identity.
Speaking about Russian market, there are several problems (challenges) that local companies
face, and which impede the performance growth. Polkina and Sukhoruchkin (2016) state that
there are two main factors types: internal and external. According to their research, the
external factors detain the competitiveness development of Russian manufacturers:


failure to fully use the potential of the local Russian scientists and specialists to conduct
the necessary research;



significant pressure on domestic manufacturers from foreign competitors;



financing of technology and innovation in a market economy conditions means the
absence of guarantees of regular income, giving it a probabilistic forecast;



absence of a unified conceptual approach towards the creation of an all-in-one national
innovation system;



low financial development of the innovation activities held by commercial banks and
venture funds;



unprotected domestic market from cheap and low-quality products

The internal factors are the objective criteria which determine the ability of an enterprise to
ensure its own competitiveness. Such factors are:


low innovation policy and technology marketing;



high costs;



outdated equipment;



long period of innovation payback;



lack of sufficient personnel expertise;



lack of information regarding the latest technologies, a complete absence of information
on sales markets, insufficient cooperation with other companies

61

Mariia Pokryshkina

All of the mentioned above obstacles may prevent Russian companies from achieving high
results in the business context. Therefore, they inhibit the competitiveness and growth
development, degrading efficiency and preventing innovation implementation.
3.5. The role of the top management support, openness & trust, and reward system in
knowledge sharing
3.5.1. Top management support
Individuals tend to always seek approval from the supervisors or other higher ranks. This is
due to the increasing level of encouragement if a person feels that "important referent
individuals are likely to approve and appreciate such behavior (Cabrera et al, 2006 as cited
in Youssef et al, 2017, p. 927). According to Wang and Noe (2010), top management support
and their knowledge appreciation promote employee commitment towards the knowledge
sharing and exchange between employees (Singh, Gupta, Busso & Kamboj, 2019).
Top management support is seen as one of the key factors driving organizational knowledge
(Connelly & Kelloway, 2003). Support from above is important when the companies are
providing employees with the adequate amount of resources and endorsement opportunities
(Lin, 2006, as cited in Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007). According to MacNeil (2004),
visible top management’s support serves as a determinant for an organizational knowledge
sharing environment. Furthermore, encouragement regarding the knowledge sharing
transmitted by the top management formulates a positive basis for the personnel
communication (Lin & Lee, 2004, as cited in Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007)
As it was investigated earlier, support from the higher ranks affects positively the learning
and creativity, thus, the knowledge sharing among employees (Amabile, Conti, Coon,
Lazenby & Herron, 1996; Davenport et al, 1998, as cited in Youssef et al, 2017). By
providing a proper climate inside an enterprise and creating a safe space where employees
are assisted with supervisory help or advisory matters, companies enhance knowledge
sharing activities. Moreover, an open leadership climate (Taylor & Wright, 2004, as cited in
Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007) and support from the top management have been

62

Mariia Pokryshkina

identified as critical driving force for the successful knowledge sharing (MacNeil, 2003;
MacNeil, 2004, as cited in Reid, 2003).
The study by Chiang, Han & Chuang (2011) has shown that a valued employee develops a
commitment through perceived organizational support, thus, becoming beneficial for an
organization. Furthermore, the authors suggest that employees' participation in the decision
making is a tool for developing trust in an enterprise, therefore, stimulating knowledgesharing behavior.
According to Leistner (2010), the trust towards the senior management is shown when the
workers are given an opportunity to implement and try out various innovative projects aimed
at stimulating the knowledge flow inside the company. Thus, supporting initiatives,
companies may get new ideas and increase the level of creativity for the sake of business.
3.5.2. Top management support in Russian context
Speaking about the Russian realities, support from the top management may be seen as
something suspicious or unnatural for the organizational culture and hierarchy inside the
company. It can be observed in the attitude to mistakes: usually the fear of making a mistake
is quite strong among Russian employees. This is one of the reasons why the delegation of
authority in many Russian companies is quite difficult to execute: mid-managerial positions
often prefer not to act at all to avoid making mistakes (Kets De Vries, 2000; Shekshnia,
1994, as cited in Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2009). Thus, eliminating any contacts with
subordinates, managers distance themselves, not providing any adequate support. Moreover,
a competitive atmosphere and a strong belief of hoarding knowledge for the competitive
advantage prevent building trusting and supportive relationships between the top
management and employees.
Another characteristic of the relationships between Russian top management and employees
is the attitude to mentoring – the majority of Russian enterprises implement mentoring only
during the probationary period of a new employee, when a mentor is responsible for the
explanation of the general organizational policy rather than intensive sharing of own
experience and intensive training. This is always due to the limited time resources, inability

63

Mariia Pokryshkina

of managers to execute their tasks as well as to pay attention to newcomers and most
importantly – a very competitive atmosphere inside the company. Moreover, abrupt
economic changes including mass layoffs, have pushed top managers (potential mentors) to
become reluctant towards sharing their knowledge and experience because of the fear of
being fired and replaced by the younger specialists (Andreeva, 2009, as cited in Andreeva
& Ihilchik, 2009).
The findings illustrating the relationship between top management support and knowledge
sharing allow to develop the following hypothesis:
H1: Top management support has a significant effect on the knowledge-sharing behavior
3.5.3. Openness & trust
Organizations can benefit from creating an internal knowledge sharing culture through
effective knowledge integration into their business strategies and encouraging workers to
develop positive attitudes to share knowledge (Connelly & Kelloway, 2003; Lin & Lee,
2004, as cited in Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007).
It comes as no surprise that trust and openness are able to boost the knowledge sharing in an
organization. Through encouraging people to rely on each other and maintaining an open
atmosphere, companies are able to bring people together and make them more eager to
communicate. "Interpersonal trust can be defined as a person's willingness to depend on
another person's actions that involve opportunism (Willliams, 2001; Zand, 1972, as cited in
Chowdhury, 2005). Sharing information with others tends to threaten the "ownership of an
idea", however, there is a high probability that a person will show trust if he or she finds it
beneficial or at least not harmful (Gambetta, 1988, 2015, as cited in Chowdhury, 2005). As
Chowdhury mentions, there is no unified classification of trust factors (Mayer, Davis &
Shoorman, 1995). Speaking about the knowledge sharing, many scholars have highlighted
trust as a fundamental factor which leads to effective professional and social collaboration
(Blau, 1964; Williams, 2001; Woods, 2001, as cited in Chowdhury, 2005). Openness can
mark knowledge-sharing behavior because openness represents a person's curiosity and
originality, which in turn are factors of whether a person will seek other people’s expertise

64

Mariia Pokryshkina

and advice (Cabrera, Collins & Salgado, 2006, as cited in Youssef et al, 2017). Moreover,
several trust enablers within the organizational context were highlighted by Widén-Wulff
(2007, p. 133):


common goals and commitment;



collaboration;



individual expertise;



correct information

In the article by Adi Gaskell (2019), he mentions a study published in the Academy of
Management Journal on how workers share ideas between each other within the
organizations, highlighting the fact that individuals repeat behavior directed at them – a
"golden rule". Furthermore, openness to the new experience is connected with active
imagination, intellectual curiosity and originality (Costa & McCrae, 1992, as cited in
Youssef et al, 2017)
Trust has been defined as a fundamental factor promoting high quality knowledge flow
within business networks and between employees (Murphy, 2006, as cited in Connell &
Voola, 2013). Moreover, it has also been seen as stipulation for building internal
relationships which enable the exchange of knowledge (Fukuyama, 1995, as cited in Connell
& Voola, 2013).
Through creating co-working opportunities based on mutual trust, companies eliminate
professional rivalry and confrontation. Furthermore, such an environment promotes the state
of ‘‘competitive collaboration’’ (Doz, 1996), which allows to lower the risks of opportunistic
behavior. Thus, collaboration occurs when the goodwill and reciprocal understanding
between actors is encouraged. However, trust is not a static object – “it is a dynamic process
that evolves according to the development of the relationship” (Clegg, 2000; as cited in
Connell & Voola, 2013). Building trust may be also challenging for the new employees when
they are joining an organization – pretty often they have to “fend for themselves” (Connell
& Voola, 2013), or “tap into” the relationships, proving they have knowledge to share

65

Mariia Pokryshkina

(Murphy, 2006). Hence, ensuring the trust-driven communication, companies can profit in a
long-term perspective.
Supporting the positive aspect of trust, it is known that people prefer to communicate with
other people rather than with documents (Levin & Cross, 2004, as cited in McNeish & Mann,
2010). Individuals, whose communication is based on trust prefer fewer formal procedures,
are more open and flexible, use decentralized decision-making processes, showing lower
impersonality in relationships (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lewis & Weigert, 1985, as cited in
McNeish & Mann, 2010) – which indicates the growth of knowledge sharing. Yousef et al.
address the theory of reasoned action (TRA), naming the trust an "environmental constraint"
which affects the attitudes of the personnel towards knowledge-sharing behavior (2017).
Thus, close contacts and face-to face communication among the workers, supported by the
positive incentives, can foster knowledge sharing in organizations.
Another curious aspect of trust was brought by Leistner (2010) – trust in a workplace can be
divided into two types: personal trust and topical trust. The first type is the interpersonal
relationships, while a topical type is related to a person's qualification and knowledge. People
may not rely on each other on a personal level, whereas they can give credit to the
professional skills of their co-workers (Leistner, 2010). However, these two types are often
correlated – effective collaborative work is often based on the positive feelings people have
towards each other. Being a matter of time, personal trust, once developed, may lead to
professional trust (Leistner, 2010).
3.5.4. Openness and trust in Russian context
In Russian companies, employees tend to show medium or low loyalty towards the employer
(May, Young & Ledgerwood, 1998, as cited in Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2009). This tendency
is a result of decades of economic instability and severe upheavals associated with the social
problems, as well as the organizational levels, when mass fluctuations occur (Gurkov &
Zelenova, 2007, as cited in Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2009).
A management tool offered by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) is an open dialogue between
employees inside the company. Unfortunately, the use of this tool is problematic in Russian

66

Mariia Pokryshkina

companies – there is a tense relationship between management and subordinates, which is
typical for many Russian organizations (May, Young & Ledgerwood, 1998, as cited in
Andreeva & Ihilchik, 2009). It significantly undermines the trust level in an organization,
and as information and knowledge are seen as a source of power, employees resist sharing
it with anyone without special need (Michailova & Husted, 2003, as cited in Andreeva &
Ihilchik, 2009). Moreover, openness among colleagues is considered to be inappropriate and
quite often employees who show interest in personal achievement are eliminated from the
organizations due to the rigid system aimed at mediocre workers with no ambitions
(Michailova, 1998, as cited in Michailova & Husted, 2003). The importance of the physical
proximity for establishing organizational trust was discussed by Leonard and Sensiper
(1998), as cited in Husted & Michailova (2002). As a complex concept, knowledge is being
hard to share between the partners with different cultural backgrounds (for example Russian
vs Western organizations), therefore, it requires establishing “tight ties” based on the mutual
trust. The more the employees accumulate and share information through active interaction,
the more attachment is developed between them (Inkpen & Beamish, 1997, as cited in
Husted & Michailova, 2002). Furthremore, such an attachment promotes forming mutual
trust through gradual cultural barriers’ elimination and increases the chances of productive
knowledge sharing (Meschi, 1997, as cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002).
Based on the prior research and findings regarding the relationship between openness and
trust and knowledge sharing, the following hypothesis was developed:
H2: Openness and trust have a significant effect on the knowledge-sharing behavior
3.5.5. Organizational reward system
Rewards are the great incentives in terms of organizational environment, and they tend to
exist in two forms: tangible and intangible. Tangible rewards are represented by the
recognition from the top management as a feedback or simple gratitude. It means
acknowledging all efforts that an individual has made – as a result uniting employee and
supervisor, promoting commitment (Milne, 2007). This master’s thesis primarily focuses on
the tangible rewards and their effects on the organizational knowledge sharing.

67

Mariia Pokryshkina

Tangible rewards can be money, various tickets or certificates. According to Milne, tangible
rewards increase motivation in terms of work completion or over-productivity. Several
factors of the performance bosting were outlined by Cameron and Pierce (Cameron & Pierce,
1997, as cited in Milne, 2007):


rewards depend on quality or concrete tasks;



rewards depend on challenging activities;



rewards are given for mastering skills;



rewards are given for being active and showing effort

Internal competition for the rewards, status and promotion in the workspace forces
employees to perceive their knowledge as a tool to ensure their position in the organization
(Ba et al, 2001; Huber, 1982; Menon and Pfeffer, 2003; Zack, 1999, as cited in Lee & Ahn,
2007). Under the fear of downsizing and general job insecurity, people become less
motivated to share their knowledge which is costly for the organizations – it is a time and
energy-consuming activity, moreover, these resources are limited (Davenport & Prusak,
1998; Goodman & Darr, 1998; Szulanski, 1996, as cited in Lee & Ahn, 2007).
In order to maintain the continuous knowledge sharing, several authors argued that reward
systems should be integrated in the organizational incentive framework (Alavi & Leidner,
1999; Ba et al, 2001; Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Gold et al, 2001, as cited in Lee & Ahn,
2007). Youssef et al (2017) quotes: "according to the expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964),
intentions to perform a certain behavior are in part determined by consequence expectation",
pointing out the importance of the clear outcomes’ formulation (p.928). Thus, providing
employees with reward stimuli, companies are able to enhance knowledge-sharing behavior
inside an organization (Bartol & Srivastava, 2002, as cited in Reid, 2003).
A relation between reward system and knowledge sharing has been discussed by Saqib,
Abrar, Sabir, Bashir & Baig (2015) – motivation and satisfaction between employees can
increase productivity and effectiveness of an organization. Moreover, the organizational

68

Mariia Pokryshkina

reward system should exist in the framework that promotes knowledge sharing based on the
recognition and positive attitude (O'Dell & Hubert, 2011, as cited in Youssef et al., 2017).
However, reward systems are quite frequently a subject of dispute (Lachance, 2000; Milne,
2007). Here are several examples that illustrate the practical implications of reward systems
integration: Buckman Laboratories gives recognition to its 100 top knowledge contributors
which is held at an annual conference at a resort site. Furthermore, an IBM department
“Lotus Development” attributes 25 percent of its total performance results to the knowledge
sharing activities executed by the customer support division (Bartol & Srivastava, 2002, as
cited in Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007).
3.5.6. Organizational reward system in Russian context
According to Huddleston & Good (1999), most motivation theories that are used nowadays
were created and tested in the USA, however, "have failed to provide consistently useful
explanations outside the USA" (p. 385). In terms of Russian legislation, unfortunately, local
standards do not involve areas that reflect the interests of many employees – employee
rewarding systems. In practice, this field becomes very complicated due to many limitations.
The laws and other normative acts of the Russian Federation are quite vague and blurred in
terms of identifying the “employee benefits”, the only analogue is “labor costs”. The
synonyms of the term “employee benefits” as an economic category are “wages”, “salary”
and “remuneration for work” (Ermakova & Ahmetova, 2011). Such a complicated system
of reward assessment is compounded by the fact that there is almost no research covering
the effectiveness of reward systems implemented on each level in Russian organizations.
Ermolina & Tarotenko refer to "legal peculiarities and totalitarian impact" when speaking
about Russian rewarding concept (2013, p.137). They claim that Russian employers tend to
use rewards as a manipulative tool often abusing their power.
By trying to keep an employee at work, a wide range of measures is applied: bonuses, loan
systems, special social and compensation payments (Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). Socalled "emotional submission" occurs because employee’s legal protection is quite low –
there are practically no counteractions to various illegal measures to manage the motivation
of workers in Russia (Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). Legal problems of labor motivation are

69

Mariia Pokryshkina

growing among informally (illegally) employed people. They get zero support – statistical
data shows that on average, from 10% to 20% of the enterprises resort to informal hiring of
temporary workers or specialists in Russia (Akimova, 2009 as cited in Ermolina &
Tarotenko, 2013). Other aspects that have a negative impact on the whole working process
are low wages and poor correlation between results and wages. Nowadays Western countries
seek fair distribution of wages by using the following scheme: basic salary + payment for
the achieved result. The following ratio is approximately 70: 30. However, while Russia has
also adopted this scheme, the level of the basic (guaranteed) salary is approximately 20% to
50%. This obviously distorts the very idea of increasing motivation for workers (Ermolina
& Tarotenko, 2013). Having limited resources, many Russian budgetary organizations
attract employees by offering "social packages" (sick leave payment, paid leave). But not all
organizations can offer social packages. Lack of the social protection is the greatest
demotivator – in Russia, wage minimum is set by the state, which is lower than the minimal
cost of living. As a result, such a minimum allows the employer to earn extra profits by
saving on wages, which is widely spread across many Russian enterprises (Ermolina &
Tarotenko, 2013). However, there are known cases of employee demotivation caused by
excessive social protection – in Germany it is unprofitable to dismiss an employee, even if
he or she does not fully execute the tasks, since the employer must pay the unemployment
benefits (Abakumova, 2009, as cited Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013).
Another particular factor influencing reward stimulation in Russian organizations is socalled Russian mentality (Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). As many authors note, a Russian
worker is irrational in his behavior. He is often carried away by the result without a clear
understanding of achieving the goal, being aware of necessary resources or evaluating his
capabilities (he acts upon the principle: “we will take the fight, let's see what happens”)
(Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). As a result, obstacles regarding the development of
incentive/motivation systems arise. Generally, incentive systems are quite rational:
achieving a certain result leads to a certain payment. When irrational employee behavior
occurs, it is difficult to choose corresponding stimulus which will actually lead to the desired
results. In this case, the manager should understand that methods of the employee motivation
can be both tangible and intangible (Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013).

70

Furthermore, management problems still occur in Russian organizations when motivation
and reward systems are developed. It is noted that differences in management style are
deeply rooted in socio-cultural and socio-psychological aspects (Ermolina & Tarotenko,
2013). According to Berdyaev, authoritarian management style and bureaucracy is hidden
deepely in the subconscious – the average Russian person avoids responsibility and seeks to
obey strong power (Pugacheva, 2013, as cited in Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). Therefore,
a manager should always prove himself as a leader of a team. Such a powerful style allows
to overcome numerous bureaucratic barriers in the organization. As organizational reward
systems are based on the employee motivation, one of the main prerequisites for that is a
transition from an administrative management style to a leadership management style
(Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013).
Based on the above-mentioned relationship between organizational reward system and
knowledge sharing, the following hypothesis was developed:
H3: Reward system has a significant effect on the knowledge-sharing behavior
Knowledge, being highly contextual, is related to the previous experience in people's minds
(Leistner, 2010). Yet, it cannot be managed, however, the knowledge flow might be initiated
and fostered. Thus, organizational culture plays the key role in shaping the knowledge
sharing framework – the more appealing to the employees the working environment is, the
more potential a company has to make knowledge sharing actually work. Three main
competitive factors influencing the knowledge sharing in organizations have been defined
based on the prior research: openness and trust, top management support and reward system.
Hence, these factors (latent variables) are checked to assess if they have a direct or an indirect
effect on the competitiveness of a firm. In order to measure this relationship, we also argue
that knowledge-sharing behavior not only has a direct effect on the firm’s competitiveness,
but also mediates the relationships between the top management support, openness and trust
and reward system to firm’s competitiveness. Thus, the following hypothesis was developed:
H4: Knowledge-sharing behavior has a significant effect on the firm’s competitiveness.

3.6. Conceptual model
The proposed research model states that the knowledge-sharing behavior is affected by the
three main factors: top management support, openness and trust and the reward system, and
that each of these factors has a positive relation with knowledge-sharing behavior. The model
also postulates that knowledge-sharing behavior has a positive impact on the firm’s
competitiveness. The four research hypotheses and the relationships have been derived
throughout the literature review, see Figure 6.
Before testing the four hypotheses, the choice of the methodology and research strategy will
be covered and explained in the next chapter.

Chapter 4: Methodology
This master’s thesis represents a conceptual framework which has been drawn literature of
management theory, information and knowledge management, knowledge sharing,
knowledge economy and organizational behavior. The main source for the scholarly
literature were electronic databases, though which the areas of study were selected. Prior to
the research, the literature review was conducted in order to retrieve the publications covering
the concepts of knowledge and how it is shared inside the organizations. The review allowed
to narrow down to the specific relevant publications (articles, books). The following concepts
were discovered upon the review process: tacit and explicit knowledge; socialization,
externalization, combination and internalization of knowledge; competitiveness and
knowledge sharing.
The relevant methodology allows to find the best solution for the data analysis – it is an
essential tool for the researchers. Calling a research "an art of investigation", Kothari (2004)
emphasizes the creative approach towards an effective research method application.
Defining a problem and formulating hypothesis does not complete a research – it requires
much more effort: collecting, organizing and evaluating data, making conclusions and
testing the goodness-of-fit of a proposed model or theory (Kothari, 2004).
4.1. Quantitative and qualitative research methods
Research as a holistic concept which is deeply rooted in our society – it is conducted in order
to statistically and scientifically validate certain assumptions. As a research is ultimately
based on the objective verification of the hypotheses, there is a need for a scientific analysis
and choice of the respective methodologies for testing the hypotheses (Taylor, 2005). Both
quantitative and qualitative research have the same basis, aiming at validity and reliability
of the research.
Qualitative research relies on interviews, direct observation, written documentation (i.e.
questionnaires, diaries or program records) (Taylor, 2005). Qualitative research implies a
naturalistic approach towards the subject of study, "attempting to make sense, of, or interpret
phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them" (Thomas, 2003, p. 1). Generally,
73

Mariia Pokryshkina

qualitative research "begins as raw, descriptive information about programs and people in
programs" (Patton, 1997, 2002, as cited in Taylor, 2005, p. 4). Data, being expressed through
the words, is classified, categorized, and after that the concept is described in detail (Taylor,
2005). Qualitative research is subjective – it is related to the attitudes, opinions and behavior,
being a functional tool, which transmits researcher's insights and impressions (Kothari,
2004). Such a research provides results in a non-quantitative form and it is not strictly
analyzed in terms of a quantity through the focus group interviews, projective techniques or
depth interviews (Kothari, 2004).
Quantitative research methods are usually illustrated by the scores and measures, producing
numerical data (Taylor, 2005). Their aim is to measure and analyze the relationships between
variables though testing hypothetical generalizations (Denzin & Lincoln, 1998; Hoepfl,
1997, as cited in Golafshani, 2003). "A quantitative researcher attempts to fragment and
delimit phenomena into measurable or common categories that can be applied to all of the
subjects or wider and similar situations" (Winter, 2000, as cited in Golafshani, 2003, p. 598).
Thus, measurable variables are used to validate the hypotheses. Contrasting with the
qualitative research, the quantitative research relies on a greater control over the observed
environment – variables can be manipulated in order to track the effect on other constructs
(Kothari, 2004). So-called simulation aspect of the quantitative research endows the original
conditions, parameters and exogenous variables with values, therefore depicting the
behavior of the process and allowing researchers to define its future prognosis.
4.2. Chosen method
The goal of this master’s thesis is to detect the extent to which the proposed assumptions
regarding the relationship between the top management support, openness and trust and
reward system to knowledge-sharing behavior and the relationship between knowledgesharing behavior and firm’s competitiveness in the context of Northwestern region of Russia
are strong and significant. Therefore, the conceptual model is examined for its relevance. To
test the model, a quantitative research approach was chosen based on the prior literature
review and relevant studies' examination (Chow & Chan, 2008; Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, &
Ringle, 2018; Hussain, & Endut, 2018; Nikou, 2019; Salkind, 2010; Svetlik, Stavrou‐Costea

74

Mariia Pokryshkina

& Lin, 2007; Youssef et al, 2017). Moreover, a quantitative research method (survey
questionnaire) was chosen in order to receive opinions and feedback on the proposed topic
(see Section 5.6). The choice of such method is argued by the specific framework of the
hypothesis’s development, measurement instruments’ selection, variables creation, data
collection method and further data analysis.
4.3. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)
In order to measure the relationships between the proposed constructs (latent variables), a
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method was utilized. The concept of SEM was
developed by many statisticians and methodologists, including Michael W. Browne, Karl G.
Jöreskog, Dag Sorbom, and Bengt O. Muthén (Salkind, 2010). SEM is used in order to
statistically test hypotheses of numerous relations between the measured variables (Salkind,
2010). SEM methodology combines three statistical techniques: multiple regression, path
analysis and factor analysis. SEM is conducted in order to define to what extent the proposed
theoretical model is supported by the obtained data, therefore, it is a confirmatory analysis
method. The proposed model is normally viewed as "a set of relations among different
constructs"(Salkind, 2010, p. 2). There are two types of SEM methods: covariance-based
SEM (CB-SEM) and partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) (Hair, Ringle & Sarstedt, 2017).
The first type is used in order to confirm or reject the theories, whereas the second type is
related to the exploratory research and theory developments, explaining the variance in the
dependent variables (Hair et al., 2017). The statistical methodology of this master’s thesis is
based on the PLS-SEM method which will be further discussed and illustrated.
4.4. PLS-SEM method
The PLS-SEM method is widely popular among the researchers as it allows to "estimate
complex models with many constructs, indicator variables and structural paths without
imposing distributional assumptions on the data" (Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, & Ringle, 2018, p.
3). Moreover, PLS-SEM illustrates the predictive aspect towards the estimation of statistical
models for the further interpretations (Sarstedt et al, 2017; Wold, 1982, as cited in Hair et al,
2018). The usage of PLS-SEM is beneficial due to its high statistical power –it enables
exploratory research to test a less developed or a still developing theory (Hair et al, 2018).
75

Mariia Pokryshkina

On top of that, PLS-SEM allows to find solutions where the small sample sizes take place
(Fornell & Bookstein, 1982; Hair et al, 2017; Willaby et al, 2015, as cited in Hair et al,
2018).
Path models of PLS-SEM are visually represented as diagrams which show the relationships
between the hypotheses and variables, while the constructs (variables which cannot be
measured directly) are represented as circles or ovals (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2016).
Indicators (items, manifest variables) are represented as the rectangles, and the relationships
between constructs, constructs and items are displayed as the single-headed arrows (Hair et
al, 2016). PLS-SEM illustrates the predictive aspect towards estimation of statistical models
for the further interpretations (Sarstedt et al., 2017; Wold, 1982, as cited in Hair et al, 2018).
Therefore, PLS-SEM approach is highly beneficial for the researchers proposing conceptual
models built upon the theoretical framework. In terms of this master’s thesis, the goal of the
developed conceptual model is to predict whether there is a significant correlation between
factors affecting the knowledge-sharing behavior and consequently impacting a firm’s
competitiveness in the organizations of the Northwestern region of Russia. The following
thesis' model includes five constructs and four hypotheses (relationships), therefore, the
choice of the PLS-SEM method is considered to be relevant and appropriate for the statistical
measurement. Furthermore, the SEM method was preliminarily utilized in the work of
Youssef et al. (2017), endowing this conceptual model with a positive perspective, which
secures a more solid grounding and reasoning for the proposed model.
In order to conduct further data analysis, SmartPLS software was used. The choice of the
following software is due to its user-friendly interface and no requirements for the extensive
prior knowledge.
4.5. Sample and data collection
In order to analyze the impact of knowledge sharing processes on the competitiveness level
in Russian companies, twenty-eight observed variables, measuring the five constructs were
used. The choice of such variables is justified by the study of Youssef at al. (2017) on the
knowledge-sharing behavior in emerging economy of the Gulf area. This thesis' research is
based on the following study due to the similar goals, proposed research model and

76

Mariia Pokryshkina

hypotheses. Moreover, the layout of the borrowed items has proven to work in the Russian
organizational context, as well as the observed variables. Such a link with the previous study
allowed to utilize reliable methods in order to minimize research errors and to see if this
model is functional. Similarities in regional economy type have also promoted the choice of
the base study.
The study of Youssef et al. (2017) proposes a SEM method in order to observe the impact
of the three independent latent variables (top management support, openness and trust and
the reward system) on the knowledge sharing processes inside the organizations as well as
the impact of the latter on firm’s competitiveness. Each of these observed variables was
operationalized on a five-point Likert scale: the higher end of the scale represents
respondent’s strong agreement with the statement and the lower end of the scale represents
a strong disagreement with the statement (Table 2). Respondents have to evaluate each item
according to their opinion and experience. The questionnaire also includes four demographic
variables based on the respondents' profiles – and they are used for the multigroup analysis
to examine if the path relationships in the model will be affected by those control variables.
The demographic variables (age, education, industry type, job function) were modified and
adjusted according to the Russian socio-cultural context.

The questionnaire was successfully pilot tested prior to this research, and proven to be
relevant to the topic and, thus, exploitative. Therefore, it was created via online Google forms
platform and an open link was distributed via Instagram, Facebook and Vkontakte (Russian
analogue of Facebook) for the voluntary participation. The link to the questionnaire was
accompanied by the explanation of the research significance and its relevance. Respondents
were notified that they should be inhabitants of the Northwestern region of Russia in order
to provide relevant information for the accuracy of the study.

Chapter 5: Results and data analysis
Following the methodology which has been represented in Chapter 4, this section provides
the results of the conducted research. First, the descriptive analysis is illustrated and
discussed, after that the results of the measurement model and structural model results are
reported. Moreover, this chapter includes a multi-group analysis and mediation analysis. The
data of 120 respondents was received and analyzed. In order to test the research hypotheses
represented in the conceptual model, (Figure 6), the structural equation modeling technique
was applied with the use of SmartPLS version 3.2.9.

5.2. Measurement model results
In order to access the measurement model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied.
According to Brown (2014), CFA is a type of structural equation modeling (SEM) used for
measuring the relations between the observed measures (indicators) and the latent variables
(factors), the hallmark of which is a hypothesis method. Under the process of CFA, the factor
loadings, unique variances and modification indexes are estimated in order to obtain the best
latent variables' indicators before testing a structural model (Schreiber, Nora, Stage, Barlow
& King, 2006). The aim is to minimize the difference between estimated and observed
matrices: a hypothesized model is utilized to estimate a population covariance matrix which
is compared with the observed covariance matrix (Schreiber et al, 2006). The validity is
tested through convergent and discriminant validity estimation.
The majority of the factor loadings showed the scores above 0.7, however items RS_1 and
Comp_1 scored the values of 0.675 and 0.655. The suggested criteria for the loadings in the
exploratory factor analysis literature are considered excellent if the value is more than 0.70,
very good, if the value is above 0.63, good if it is above 0.55 good, fair if it is above 0.45,
and poor if it is greater than 0.32 respectively (Comrey & Lee, 1992, as cited in DiStefano
& Hess, 2005). Hence, the values of the items RS_1 and Comp_1 are acceptable for the
model. All items with the loadings lower than these values were rejected and, therefore,
removed.
As a part of confirmatory factor analysis, the convergent validity was tested through the
composite reliability (CR) and the average variance extracted (AVE). The composite
reliability results are illustrated in Table 7, ranging between 0.835 and 0.932. According to
Hair et al. (2018), values between 0.70 and 0.90, indicate “satisfactory to good" level of
reliability, therefore received values are relevant and consistent with the recommended
threshold. Followed by the convergent validity measures, the average variance extracted
(AVE) values are illustrated in the last column of the Table 7, ranging from 0.563 to 0.663.
According to Hair et al (2018), the results are above the recommended score of 0.5, which
shows that the construct validates a minimum of 50% of the items variance. Moreover, as
the recommended minimum threshold for the Cronbach's alpha score is 0.70 (Hair et al,
2018), the received model values are accepted, ranging from 0.743 to 0.914.

The discriminant validity can be measured by using Fornell & Larcker (1981) criterion and
Heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) (Henseler et al, 2015, as cited in Hair et al, 2018) ratio of
correlation. According to Fornell-Lacker criterion, the square root of each construct’s AVE
should show a bigger value than the correlations with other latent constructs. The
discriminant validity results are confirmed (Table 8) as the values received are greater than
the correlations.

An alternative approach to measure a discriminant validity is a Heterotrait-monotrait
(HTMT) ratio of the correlation proposed by Henseler, Ringle and Sarstedt (2015). Values
above 0.90 for structural models with conceptually similar constructs would mean that
discriminant validity is not present, however for the more distinct concepts, the value of 0.85
is suggested. Generally, if an HTMT value is close to 1, the validity is not presented. In the
Table 9, all of the values are below the threshold of 0.85 excluding (TMS-RS, 0.872),
however, they are all below 0.90, which confirms the discriminant validity of the model.

5.3. Structural model results
The conceptual model introduced in the Section 3.8. is tested via the structural equation
modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS version 3.2.9. Significant level values and coefficient
values were obtained through the bootstrapping method. Moreover, the path coefficients are
measured in order to test the hypotheses. The effect of three constructs (top management
support, openness & trust, reward system) on the knowledge-sharing behavior was explained
by a variance of 47.5%. The knowledge sharing effect on the competitiveness of the firm
was explained by a variance of 33%. R Square values and the path relationships are shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Structural model findings
Notes: *** p-value < 0.001; ** p-value < 0.005; * p-value < 0.01

The results of the SEM analysis have revealed that the top management support has no direct
effect on the knowledge-sharing behavior, thus, H1 is not supported by the conceptual
model. A relationship between the openness and trust and the knowledge-sharing behavior
was found to be significant (β = 0.630, t = 5.767, p < 0.001), therefore H2 is supported by
the conceptual model. According to the results of the SEM analysis, the reward system does
not have a significant path to the firm's competitiveness, thus, H3 is not supported by the
conceptual model. Moreover, the knowledge-sharing behavior showed a significant relation
with the firm's competitiveness (β = 0.574, t = 9.264, p < 0.001), indicating H4 is supported
by the conceptual model.

5.4. Multi-group analysis
The age of the respondents, their education level, company industry and job position were
used as control variables in the multigroup analysis (MGA). The goal was to reveal whether
there are differences regarding the knowledge-sharing behavior between the different age
groups, academic and non-academic education level of respondents, their job position and
the industry type they are involved in. However, the job position and industry type groups
were eliminated from the analysis due to the uneven division of responses, therefore a very
small group size – SmartPLS was unable to generate the output.
Regarding the age of the respondents, no significant paths were identified. In terms of the
education level of the respondents, the path between openness & trust and knowledgesharing behavior is not significant for the respondents with the non-academic education
(high school, technical and vocational education and training), whereas it proved to be
significant for the respondents with the academic education (from bachelor’s degree to
doctoral degree) (β =0.703, t =5.813, p < 0.001). This indicates that respondents holding an
academic degree are more likely to share their knowledge if such factor as openness & trust
exists in the organization.
5.5. Mediation analysis
A mediation analysis was conducted in order to identify whether the knowledge-sharing
behavior mediates the relationship between three constructs of the conceptual model (top
management support, openness and trust, reward system) and a firm's competitiveness. The
results of the total indirect effects show that the knowledge-sharing behavior only mediates
the relationship between the openness & trust and the firm's competitiveness (β = 0.399, t =
4.040, p < 0.001) and this path is significant. However, according to the total indirect effects
values, the knowledge-sharing behavior does not mediate the relationship between the top
management support and the firm's competitiveness, nor does it mediate the relationship
between the reward system and the firm's competitiveness.

5.6. Qualitative analysis
In order to receive the information regarding the effects of the top management support,
openness & trust and reward system on the knowledge sharing and the firm's
competitiveness, the results of the questionnaire were analyzed through SmartPLS
(confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multi-group analysis (MGA) and mediation analysis).
However, the respondents were offered to provide any insights regarding the topic of study
in a form of comments at the end of the questionnaire. Out of 120 respondents, only 3 people
anonymously shared their feedback. It was clear that the respondents highlighted the absence
of the incentives towards the knowledge sharing in the organizations in Russia, contrasting
with the knowledge sharing practices in Finland:
I worked both in Russia and in Finland. Unfortunately, my experience shows that in Russia
neither the colleagues, nor the management or the organization, as a whole, need ideas,
advice, changes. Since my experience is small, I want to believe that such facts are not
present everywhere. Nevertheless, at the moment, I am convinced that such a culture is
present in Finland, as both in universities and organizations, both management and
colleagues are open to new things and also share with others.
– Respondent #26
Another respondent claimed that there is almost no knowledge sharing across departments
in organization she works in, moreover the respondent wanted to switch to another job due
to inability to share knowledge, which she thinks is a very important factor:
Unfortunately, the place where I am working now does not meet my needs, the knowledge of
my not-so-original and erudite colleagues, in fact, is not interesting to me. Therefore, I share
my knowledge only with one of my colleagues, with my manager and our marketing
department. In addition, the colleagues who are sitting behind the wall are not interested in
what we are doing in the marketing department, hence, there are even fewer points of contact
for sharing knowledge. In the near future I’m planning to work in another organization,
which is diametrically opposite regarding the structure and field. Knowledge sharing, as a
part of internal communication, is the most important aspect in any job. I want to develop
87

Mariia Pokryshkina

not only the business which I'm working in, but also to have space for my personal
development.
– Respondent # 7
Another informative comment was left by the Respondent # 33, noting that she was
experiencing the lack of knowledge sharing, which restricted her potential opportunities. In
her opinion, it was due to the absence of mentoring, which is very important in the technical
field (the respondent stated the construction industry as a field of employment). She also
mentioned that less experienced employees do not have a possibility to apply their theoretical
knowledge in practice, thus, creating a vicious circle at the workplace:
I would say that the knowledge exchange is very weak. For me personally, the only way to
learn something new is to understand it myself, dig into the literature, google, delve into,
etc. In addition, in my technical field it’s not enough just to read the theory, you still need to
apply it to the real production problems, which does not always work out because such tasks
are simply given to the more experienced professionals. I would really like to have a mentor
at work. Therefore, I always try to help my younger colleagues myself.
–

Respondent # 33

The certain tendency throughout the following comments illustrates that Russian employees
have a clear idea of what the knowledge sharing is, moreover, they experience a strong
deficiency of it, which has a negative effect on the overall workflow. The qualitative analysis
throws the light on the problems of the knowledge management in Russian companies,
furthermore these comments leave an impression of that employees are not sufficiently
provided with the top management support in the workplace.

Chapter 6: Discussion. Practical implications of the research
This master’s thesis’ intention is to investigate the effects of the top management support,
openness and trust and reward system on the knowledge-sharing behavior and the level of
competitiveness among the organizations in Russia. The key theoretical objective was to see
whether the conceptual model developed by Youssef et al. (2017) could be replicated and
applied in the context of the Russian market. Moreover, the Structural Equation Modeling
(SEM) method was employed in order to determine whether the concept of knowledge
sharing in Russia has any specific peculiarities and to which extent the knowledge sharing
in the Russian companies promotes the competitiveness of these companies. The main focus
of this chapter is to report the major research findings, practical implications and also to
justify the value of the following study.
6.1. Main findings
The overall goal of this master’s thesis is to verify the effect of three independent latent
variables influencing knowledge-sharing behavior directly and competitiveness of the
organizations indirectly in a country-specific context, which has not yet received sufficient
academic attention. The research framework was built upon the already existing studies
which used the SEM methodology in order to test the impact of the top management support,
openness and trust, and reward system on the knowledge-sharing behavior and further firm’s
competitiveness (Youssef et al, 2017). The academic research analysis on the organizational
knowledge sharing and competitiveness in the Russian context has revealed that such a
conceptual model has not been previously tested. Moreover, there is a lack of the academic
knowledge on the factors influencing the knowledge sharing activities in Russia-specific
business environment.
In this thesis, top management support, openness and trust, reward system, knowledge
sharing, and firm’s competitiveness were used as five main constructs to develop the
research conceptual model (Youssef et al., 2017). Moreover, the survey questions were
derived from previously validated studies showing that they can be easily applied in the
organizational context worldwide. However, some demographic questions regarding the

89

Mariia Pokryshkina

education level of participants and their job-specific industry were modified in order to
match the local regulations. The model was further examined according to the hypotheses
developed. The results of the hypotheses testing are illustrated in the Table 10.

sharing behavior and firm’s competitiveness

As was proposed in the Section 3.5.2., the link between the knowledge-sharing behavior and
support from the top management has been acknowledged by many researchers (Amabile,
Conti, Coon, Lazenby & Herron, 1996; Cabrera et al, 2006; Chiang, Han & Chuang, 2011;
Davenport et al. 1998; Singh, Gupta, Busso & Kamboj, 2019; Wang & Noe, 2010).
Consistent with the literature, the construct of the top management support was confirmed,
approved and utilized in this master’s thesis. In terms of Russian context, top management
support has not proved to be effective due to the several knowledge-sharing hoarding factors.
Among them are authority delegation, high competitiveness and limited time resources –
quite often top management in Russian companies sees knowledge sharing practice as a loss
of personal competitive advantage. Such a belief leads to low employee involvement, project
participation and generally low organizational learning. Moreover, due to the vertical
organizational hierarchy, managers tend to distance themselves from their subordinates,
thus, creating a communication gap (Husted & Michailova, 2002).
Such a theoretical framework found its support in the research conducted in the
Northwestern region of Russia. The findings (Section 5.3.) have revealed that top
90

Mariia Pokryshkina

management support does not have a direct effect on the knowledge-sharing behavior in the
organizations located the Northwestern region of Russia. Moreover, the mediation analysis
has not identified any indirect relationship between top management support and firm’s
competitiveness among the Russian companies according to the data received. The
qualitative analysis of the participants’ feedback has also proved that no adequate top
management support is being provided for the employees in Russian companies investigated
in this research, therefore, knowledge-sharing behavior is not stimulated with regards to this
factor. The findings of this master’s thesis align with the previous research by Husted &
Michailova (2002), who confirm the existing obstacles in Russian companies towards the
knowledge sharing. In their work, they conclude that being ambitious and having initiative
can be a subject of shame or even stigmatization. This is due to the fact that Russian top
management respects obedience and non-questionable subordination (Michailova, 1998, as
cited in Husted & Michailova, 2002). Such features as high centralization, importance of
formal rules, one-man authority and no tolerance towards pluralism and diversity only
promote reluctance towards ideas and knowledge sharing between different departments
(Husted & Michailova, 2002). The same lack of the cross-department knowledge sharing
was mentioned in the questionnaire by several participants – they complain about
indifference from the managerial side. Therefore, support from the top management is
heterogenous and atypical to happen in Russian companies, and it is not considered as a
significant factor influencing the knowledge-sharing behavior.
Section 3.5.3. postulates the link between the openness and trust and active knowledge
sharing inside the companies (Blau, 1964; Cabrera, Collins & Salgado, 2006; Chowdhury,
2005; Connell & Voola, 2013; Gambetta, 1988, 2015; Levin & Cross, 2004; McNeish &
Mann, 2010; Murphy, 2006; Willliams, 2001; Woods, 2001; Zand, 1972). The findings
(Section 5.3.) support the proposed assumption. Moreover, it is validated by the SEM
analysis – confirming the effect of openness and trust on the knowledge-sharing behavior in
Russian organizations. Furthermore, the mediation analysis has shown that the relationship
between openness and trust and firm's competitiveness is mediated by the knowledgesharing behavior. The findings of this master’s thesis do not align with the in prior research
of Husted & Michailova (2002), Andreeva & Ihilchik (2009), and Michailova & Husted
(2003) who indicate that there is low internal organizational trust when it comes to
91

Mariia Pokryshkina

knowledge sharing inside Russian companies. They mention the lack of loyalty towards the
employer, tendency of not sharing information “with the outsiders” at one’s own free will in
the workspace and physical distance (Leonard & Sensiper, 1998, as cited in Husted &
Michailova, 2002). Such a discrepancy in the results could be explained by the outdated data
and general research deficiency regarding the modern organizational knowledge sharing
approaches in Russia.
Section 3.5.5. postulates the link between the organizational reward systems and internal
knowledge sharing (Lachance, 2000; Lee & Ahn, 2007; Milne, 2007; Reid, 2003; Svetlik,
Stavrou‐Costea & Lin, 2007; Youssef et al., 2017). The structural model results did not
support the proposed assumption. This might be due to the fact that the rewards or “employee
benefits” are not present in the Russian legislation and are quite often neglected due to not
fitting the standards. Moreover, Ermolina & Tarotenko (2013) claim that employees in
Russia often lack the legal protection in the workplace – researchers specify that such right
violations are caused by the totalitarian mechanisms used by the employers, who exploit the
remuneration for their own manipulative purposes. Moreover, a complete divergence
between salaries and work tasks ruins the employees’ motivation or any ambitions to succeed
(Ermolina & Tarotenko, 2013). It contradicts with the idea of applying any effort as such
endeavor will not be compensated in any way, not endowing the stimulus with a monetary
worth or a valuable rationale. Furthermore, no supporting arguments of the assumption that
organizational reward systems have a significant power on the knowledge-sharing behavior
inside the Russian companies were found among the results of the SEM analysis, mediation
analysis and qualitative analysis. Hence, the reward system construct was not acknowledged
as an important prerequisite affecting the organizational knowledge sharing. However, due
to the relative scarcity of the data and research on this topic, the following outputs might not
reflect the organizational realities of the country-scale.
6.2. Conclusion
The aim of this master’s thesis was to measure which of the such factors as top management
support, openness & trust and reward system influences the organizational knowledge
sharing activities in Russia and to detect whether it has any effect on the firm’s overall

92

Mariia Pokryshkina

competitiveness. As a result, two out of the four developed hypotheses were confirmed.
Moreover, the following research questions were identified:


RQ1: How do openness and trust, top management support and reward systems promote
the knowledge sharing in the organizations?



RQ2: How does the knowledge sharing affect the overall competitiveness of the
organization?

Taking the first research question into consideration, the results of this master’s thesis
indicate that respondents are more eager to be engaged in the cooperative demeanor provided
that their organizational relations are ensured by the openness and trust. It positively
influences and stimulates the employees, promoting common goals and commitment.
Moreover, in the context of developing economy of Russia, considering its multi-cultural
and faceted organizational mechanisms, openness and trust proved to be a fundamental
factor which Russian companies are successfully adopting and implementing.
Russian management did not prove to be supportive in terms of promoting the knowledge
flow inside the Russian firms. The qualitative analysis confirms the existing crossdepartmental knowledge sharing barriers – each of three respondents stated that he/she does
not directly communicate with their top management. Furthermore, unstable economic
situation in Russia and low social protection of employees’ force employers to lower the
risks and to limit or completely eliminate the material stimulus. The results of this master’s
thesis differ from the other studies on the knowledge sharing in Russia, proving the
functioning novelty of this thesis’ conceptual model. Therefore, the perspectives of openness
and trust are highly emphasized due to the revealed impact on the knowledge sharing
processes in the organizations in Russia, which is a theoretical contribution by itself
providing a new outline for the future research.
With regard to the second research question, the aim was to assess the existence of any
correlations between the knowledge-sharing behavior and company’s performance. the
following research indicates that a firm could increase its competitive advantage through

93

Mariia Pokryshkina

establishing a reliable organizational environment. Hence, the linkage between knowledgesharing behavior and competitiveness was confirmed. However, support from the top
management and reward system did not prove to be sufficient mediators affecting the
performance of the Russian enterprises.
The additional research results were discovered after the multi-group analysis of the
respondents’ demographic data was conducted. The following analysis shows that those with
higher academic degrees are more likely to share their knowledge in Russian organizations
if the organizational framework is based on mutual trust and an open working environment
is maintained in a company.
6.3. Theoretical and practical implications
This thesis contributes to the studies of the knowledge sharing management, knowledge
sharing activities and organizational performance through applying the conceptual model
developed by Youssef et al. (2017) with regards to the Russian market conditions. Both
academics and practitioners may find the findings of this research valuable. The revealed
gaps in the theoretical knowledge are related to the lack of the research on Russian
organizational culture, moreover, they invite for attention to the knowledge management
development in the context of the emerging economies from the academic society.
Furthermore, the findings of this master’s thesis also provide potential stimuli for the
researchers to examine this topic more in detail.
As an option, the initial conceptual model (Figure 6) could be modified, expanded and
applied on the other demographic scope in order to investigate the determinants of the
organizational knowledge-sharing behavior. As an alternative, a conceptual model focusing
on the direct impact of the top management support, openness & trust and reward system
could be developed. Besides, other constructs and mediators could be implemented into the
model. An illustration of an alternative model is shown in Figure 9. Additionally, more
theoretical literature and resources could be utilized, therefore, enriching the research value.

94

Mariia Pokryshkina

Figure 9. An alternative conceptual model
Speaking about the practical implications of this research, business and state-owned
companies may find some of the insights covering the factors shaping the knowledge-sharing
behavior inside the organizations. Due to a relatively new phenomenon in the Russian
management culture, knowledge management has generally been lacking sufficient
attention. Firstly, the findings should motivate practitioners to perceive openness & trust as
a factor potentially increasing their competitiveness. Thus, ensuring openness and trust in
the workplace, Russian companies may benefit from the internal knowledge exchange,
therefore expanding their fields of expertise. Moreover, such motivational factors as reward
system and mentorship of the top management have a great potential if they are efficiently
implemented into the organizational knowledge sharing processes.
6.4. Limitations
This master’s thesis has several limitations which have to be interpreted. As the research was
conducted only in the Northwestern region of Russia, the sample may not be representative
for the whole country. Moreover, there is no unified rule which regulates the sample size
used for the SEM multi-group analysis – some academics suggest that the sample is
representative if there are at least five cases per one observed variable (Bentler and Chou,
1987, as cited in Nikou, 2019), whereas others suggest ten cases are the bottom line
(Nunnally, 1967, as cited in Nikou, 2019). Hence, the findings of this paper are limited

95

Mariia Pokryshkina

because several groups were eliminated from the multi group analysis due to the lack of
observations.
The lack of the linkage between the top management support, reward systems and the
knowledge-sharing behavior could specify the low participants’ awareness regarding the
concept of the knowledge sharing, meaning that respondents’ prior knowledge on the
knowledge sharing practices may vary from high, satisfactory, low or it can be completely
absent. Moreover, this research is based on the prior work of Youssef et al. (2017), which
has its own limitations, for example, they use a certain list of constructs (only five), which
could be expanded.
This master’s thesis postulates that the support of the top management, openness and trust
and the presence of the reward system in the organizations in Russia are able to influence
the knowledge-sharing behavior, which strengthens the firm’s performance.
6.5. Future research
Knowledge-sharing practices and managerial activities may vary depending on the sociocultural context or regional peculiarities (Andreeva & Ikhilchik, 2011; Kim et al., 2014;
Magnier-Watanabe et al., 2011; Michailova & Husted, 2003; Sergeeva & Andreeva, 2016,
as cited in Hussinki, Kianto, Vanhala & Ritala, 2017). Having a complex administrative
governance structure combined with the vivid cultural dispersion, Russia represents a unique
organizational management style. Therefore, a research on the knowledge sharing factors
could be conducted in the other regions of Russia in order to reflect the results on a bigger
scale. Moreover, a future research should be conducted with regards to alternative methods
and creative approaches in terms of knowledge management and performance goals. One
way to support the knowledge sharing habits inside an organization is to realize the power
of a human capital by the Russian managers and to proactively implement employee
trainings and to provide them with growth opportunities (Hussinki, Kianto, Vanhala &
Ritala, 2017). In this case, the research idea of estimating the correlation between the
trainings provided in the workplace and its impact on the firm’s performance has aroused.
Moreover, a development of the Russian management theory could be presented in the future

96

Mariia Pokryshkina

academic works in order to provide the contemporary insights into the knowledge
management field in Russia and its perspectives.
