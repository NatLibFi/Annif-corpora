Title of the work: The effect of mothers’ socioeconomic status and postpartum
depression on children’s early language development
Supervisors: Pirkko Rautakoski & Linnea Karlsson
Language development is influenced by several biological and environmental factors
in a child’s life. One environmental factor that has raised much attention in this field
is the socioeconomic status (SES) of the family and whether it affects children’s
language development. Another considered risk factor for children’s language
development is maternal postpartum depression, which may affect mothers shortly
after giving birth. It has been discussed also whether the effect of postpartum
depression differs dependent on the mother’s socioeconomic status.
The aim of this study was to explore the association between the socioeconomic
status of the mother and the language development of children at 14 months of age. In
addition, the thesis explored whether the association between mothers’ postpartum
depression and children’s language development differs depending on the mothers’
SES. Based on the mothers’ education, three socioeconomic groups were created and
formed the measurement of SES. Depressive symptoms in mothers were assessed by
the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale on three occasions after giving birth (i.e. 3,
6 and 12 months postpartum). Children’s receptive and expressive vocabulary as well
as their use of gestures were assessed by the MacArthur Communicative Inventory at
14 months of age. Confounding variables that have been identified as influencing
language development, such as gender, gestational weeks, mother’s age and her use
of smoking, were controlled for in the analyses.
The results revealed no statistically significant association between the mothers’ SES
and children’s language development at 14 months. In other words, no statistically
significant associations were found between the mothers’ SES and children’s
receptive or expressive vocabulary, neither with their use of gestures. It appears that
other confounding variables might better explain the variations in language
development among children. In this study gender and gestational weeks explained
part of the variation in both receptive and expressive language development of the
participating children. In addition, mothers age explained part of the expressive
development and smoking part of the receptive development. The effect of the
mothers’ postpartum depression on children’s language development did also not
differ between different SES-groups. In future research about this subject, the effect
of SES on children’s language development should be assessed also with children in
higher ages, because the effects of SES can probably not be seen until the language
development has proceeded a bit further. Further information regarding the mothers’
use of medication or received therapy because of the postpartum depression should
also be included to enable reliable conclusions about associations between mothers’
postpartum depression and children’s language development.

Arbetets titel: Effekten av mammans socioekonomiska status och postpartumdepression på
barns tidiga språkutveckling
Handledare: Pirkko Rautakoski & Linnea Karlsson
Barns språkutveckling påverkas av olika biologiska faktorer och omgivningsfaktorer. En
omgivningsfaktor som har uppmärksammats inom detta område är familjens
socioekonomiska status (SES) och i vilken utsträckning dess inverkan har på barnets
språkutveckling. En annan riskfaktor som anses påverka barnets språkutveckling är
postpartumdepression hos mamman, som kan drabba mammor efter förlossningen. Det har
också diskuterats hurvida mammans postpartumdepression påverkar språkutvecklingen hos
barnet olika beroende på mammans socioekonomiska status.
Syftet med studien var att undersöka sambandet mellan mammans socioekonomiska status
och barns språkutveckling vid 14 månaders ålder. Därtill undersöktes det i studien hurvida
associationen mellan mammans postpartumdepression och barnets språkutveckling
påverkas på olika sätt i olika socioekonomiska grupper. Mammorna delades in i tre grupper
utgående från deras utbildning och skapade på så sätt måttet av SES. Mammornas
depressiva symptom bedömdes med hjälp av screening-testet Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale under tre tillfällen efter förlossningen (3,6 och 12 månader efter
förlossning). Barnens receptiva och expressiva ordförråd samt deras användning av gester
bedömdes med hjälp av formuläret MacArthur-Bates Communicative Inventory vid 14
månaders ålder. Övriga faktorer som har visats ha en inverkan på språkutvecklingen, som
exempelvis kön, gestationsveckor, mammans ålder och rökning under graviditeten,
beaktades i analyserna.
Resultatet visade att det inte fanns en statistisk signifikant association mellan mammornas
SES och barnens språkutveckling. Det fanns ingen statistiskt signifikant association mellan
mammornas SES och barnens receptiva eller expressiva ordförråd, inte heller med deras
användning av gester. Det tyder på att andra variabler bättre kan förklara variationer i
språkutvecklingen hos barn. I den här undersökningen förklarade kön och gestationsveckor
en del av variationen i både det receptiva och expressiva ordförrådet. Därtill förklarade
mammans ålder en del av variationen i barnens expressiva ordförråd och rökning under
graviditeten förklarade en del av variationen i barnens receptiva ordförråd. Effekten av
mammans postpartumdepression på barnens språkutveckling var också den samma
oberoende av socioekonomisk grupptillhörighet. I framtida forskning kring ämnet kunde
det vara fördelaktigt att undersöka effekten av SES på barns språkutveckling även hos äldre
barn, eftersom effekten kanske syns först i ett senare skede av språkutvecklingen.
Information angående mammornas läkemedelsanvändning och tillgång till terapi på grund
av postpartumdepressionen kunde också ha inkluderats för att möjliggöra mera tillförlitliga
antaganden angående associationen mellan mammornas postpartumdepression och barnens
språkutveckling.

1 Introduction
The prerequisites for children to acquire language are formed by biological factors but
are also influenced by a child’s environment (Hoff, 2006). Most of the aspects
concerning speech and language development children learn and experience during their
first years of life and many of these experiences depend on the parents’ or caregivers’
actions (Bornstein & Bradley, 2002). There has been an interest among researchers to
explore the effect of these different environmental factors on children’s early language
development. For example, different family factors, such as economic or ethnic
differences have been considered to influence early parent-child interactions (Pace, Luo,
Hirsh-Pasek, Michnick & Golinkoff, 2017; Rowel & Goldin-Meadow, 2009) and
parenting style (Hoff, Laursen & Tardif, 2002; Raviv, Kessenich & Morison, 2004)
which in turn might affect children’s speech and language development. These
environmental factors have also shown to predict children’s later cognitive and
academic achievement (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). Therefore, it is of importance to
examine which factors, and to what extent, that have an impact, on children’s speech
and language development.

1.1 Factors influencing speech and language development
Gender is a biological factor that has shown to impact language development. In the
study by Eriksson et al. (2012), girls were generally ahead of boys on all language areas
and the differences increased up to 2 years and 6 months of age. Prematurity is another
factor that repeatedly has shown to be a risk for delayed language development (FosterCohen, Edgin, Champion & Woodward, 2007; Lee, Yeatman, Luna & Feldman, 2011;
Schirmer, Portuguez & Nunes, 2006) but, it appears that language development can be
affected also for children who are not premature but born early term as well (SteneLarsen et al., 2014). Children born before gestational week 37 are considered as
premature (Parikka & Lehtonen, 2007). In Bruun’s pro gradu study (2019), the results
indicated that although premature children had been excluded from the analysis,
gestational weeks still significantly predicted the language level of children at 14
months of age. Furthermore, associations have been found between maternal age and
children’s language development, suggesting that lower maternal age is associated with
lower language level in children (Keown, Woodward & Fielda, 2001). Lastly, maternal

Rebecka Rönnblad

smoking during pregnancy has shown to be associated with negative outcomes in
children’s early language development (Key et al., 2007).
One environmental factor that has raised much attention in this field is the
socioeconomic status (SES) of the family (Noble, McCandliss & Farah, 2007).
Numerous studies have investigated the relation between a family’s SES and different
developmental and health outcomes in children. Although SES is a widely studied
subject, there is to date no final definition of the term agreed by researchers (Bradley et
al., 2002). In the literature, measurements of SES differ, but are often seen to be based
on either occupation, education or income levels (Adler & Ostrove, 1999; Noble et al.,
2007; Raviv et al., 2004). Families with a higher parental SES typically present a better
physical and mental health, cognitive performance and academic achievement (Farah,
2017). Meanwhile, lower parental SES associates with experiencing more stress factors
in the environment, as well as instability and psychiatric illnesses, such as depression
(Pace et al., 2017). It has also been observed that the occurrence of smoking during
pregnancy is higher for mothers in lower SES-groups (Ekblad, Gissler, Korkeila &
Lehtonen, 2013).
In families with a higher SES, the possibilities are better for the parents to be able to
provide their children with necessary inputs such as nutritious meals and childcare
settings, and also stimulating environments for the child’s language development in the
form of books or toys (Bornstein et al., 2002). Differences in these factors therefore
raise the question whether and how language development in turn will be affected by
this variance. For instance, quantity and quality of interactions between parent and child
as well as language stimulating environments, have shown to have crucial effects on
language development (Pace et al., 2017).
Uncertainty remains whether the effect of SES on children’s language development is
consistent worldwide, but there is evidence showing that the SES of the family might
not have the same influence on children’s language development in countries where
access to high-quality health care and education is more equal for all citizens (Adler et
al., 1999; Pace et al., 2017). This information is important to identify relevant risk and
resilience factors and ultimately to develop targeted measures to support children’s
language development both on societal, family and individual levels.

Previous research also suggests that mothers in lower SES-groups are at a higher risk of
suffering from some form of depression than mothers in higher SES-groups (Serge,
O’Hara, Arndt & Stuart, 2007). Even though all mothers from different SES-groups are
at risk of postpartum depression, an elevated risk is related belonging to lower SEScategories (Goyal, Gay & Lee, 2010). Postpartum depression refers to a type of
depression in mothers that can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth
(World Health Organization, 2018). According to the definition in World Health
Organization (2018), symptoms that may occur are feelings of sadness, anxiety and an
experience of sleep disturbance. The prevalence of postpartum depression is around 1015% in new mothers (Grace, Evindar & Stewart, 2003). This type of psychological
stress of the mothers, has been shown to affect different domains of children’s
development (Lupien, King, Meaney, & McEwen, 2000). More specifically, having
depressive symptoms, whether during the prenatal or postpartum period, has for
example been considered as a risk factor for delayed language development in children
(Paulson, Keefe & Leiferman, 2009).

1.2 Relationship between socioeconomic status and children’s language
development
The relationship between the family’s SES and children’s language development has
been a subject of interest among researchers. Studies have repeatedly shown differences
in language development among children by parental SES (Fernald, Marchman &
Weisleder, 2013; Korpilahti, Kaljonen & Jansson-Verkasalo, 2016; Noble et al., 2007;
Pungello, Iruka, Dotterer, Mills-Koonce & Reznick, 2009). However, uncertainties
remain about in which age these differences start to occur and what exactly it is about
SES that affects language development.
Possible theories about how the family’s SES affects language development of children
have been proposed. One contributing factor could be that differences in SES are related
to differences in environments, which means that children experience different language
environments (Hoff & Laursen, 2002). Varying language learning opportunities,
experience and exposure are all factors that affect language development (Hoff, 2003;
Pace et al., 2017). Early findings by the British sociologist Bernstein (1970), imply that
mothers in different SES-groups speak differently to their children. As a result, children

Rebecka Rönnblad

acquire different communicative abilities. Consistent with this, more recent studies have
repeatedly shown similar results (Hoff, 2003; Rowe, Özçalışkan & Goldin-Meadow,
2008). In studies where researchers have examined the role of language exposure in
families with different SES, the results show that mothers with a higher SES are more
likely to speak more frequently to their children, use a richer vocabulary and ask more
follow-up questions (Hoff- Ginsberg, 1998; Hoff et al., 2002; Hoff & Tian, 2005).
These are all factors that support positive outcomes for the language development (Hoff
& Tian, 2005). Another hypothesis is that parenting might have an influence on
children’s language development. It has been shown that parenting in lower SES-groups
is more associated with a less responsive and more restrictive parenting style, while
parenting in higher SES-groups are shown to be less restrictive (Raviv et al., 2004).
Also, Pungello et al., (2009), have results showing that parenting is a partial mediator of
the relationship between the family’s SES and expressive skills among children.
One of the most challenging parts of evaluating the language development of children
around 1 year of age is likely to be the way of performing the assessment. Since
children during their first year of life do not use a large amount of verbal
communication, language development must be assessed by other means, e.g. their use
of gestures (Fernald et al., 2013). In the study by Rowel et al. (2009), an association
between children’s early use of gestures and later language development was found.
Children of families with a higher SES frequently used more gestures at 14 months of
age in parent-child interactions and they also showed a larger vocabulary at 54 months
of age, compared to children of families with a lower SES. Another way of studying
early language development was carried out by Clearfield, Bailey, Jenne, Stanger and
Tacke (2014). They measured early language development with the number of
exploratory behaviors, such as oral and manual object exploration, when the child was
6, 9 and 12 months of age. The measurement of SES was in this study based on
maternal education and three SES-groups were created (low, mid and high). The results
showed that differences in children of different SES-groups could be seen already at this
age. The children in the lower SES-group showed less exploration overall than their
peers in higher SES-groups.
Korpilahti et al. (2016), studied a number of biological and environmental risk factors
for language delay in children at 13-36 months in a Finnish cohort study. According to
their results, the children of parents with a higher education and social class showed

Rebecka Rönnblad

better skills in language comprehension, compared to the children of parents in the
lower SES- groups. Pungello et al. (2009), found that children in families with a lower
SES showed a slower rate of growth in expressive language between the ages of 18 and
36 months, compared to the children in families with a higher SES. Similar results were
found in the study by Fernald et al. (2013), where children’s early language
development was assessed at 18 and 24 months of age in different SES-groups. The
results showed that there were striking differences between children in lower and higher
SES-groups as early as 18 months when comparing vocabulary size and language
processing skills. The children from the lower SES-groups had significantly lower
vocabulary scores than their peers in higher SES-groups at 18 months and the trend was
also observed at 24 months. Moreover, differences in language development in different
SES-groups were found by Hoff (2003), who studied the influence of SES in the context
of the amount of maternal speech. The results showed that differences in children’s
productive vocabulary could be explained by different use of maternal speech in
different SES-groups so that lower SES is related to less frequent speech by the mother.
Furthermore, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, and Huttenlocher (2008), studied the syntactic
development of children in different SES-groups, and found that no differences between
the groups at 14 and 18 months were visible, but the differences started to appear at 26
months of age. At this point, the children in the higher SES-group showed much more
frequent use of complex sentences. Huttenlocher, Waterfall, Vasilyeva, Vevea and
Hedges (2010) also found that differences in the syntactic structures that caregivers use,
affect the language development of the children.

1.3 Relationship between maternal postpartum depression and children’s
language development in different socioeconomic groups

In the association between maternal postpartum depression and children’s language
development, a crucial element is likely to be the mother’s way of caregiving when
experiencing symptoms associated with depression, such as sadness or withdrawal. This
might negatively affect the language development of the child (Stein, Malmberg, Sylva,
Barnes & Leach, 2008). The verbal communication between mothers who suffer from
postpartum depression and their infants seems to differ compared to non-depressed

Rebecka Rönnblad

6

mothers. During interactions, mothers with depression have shown to be less vocally
expressive and to use fewer facial expressions than non-depressed mothers (SohrPreston & Scaramella, 2006). In studies about this relationship, the hypothesis is often
that due to mothers’ depression symptoms, their children’s language development will
be negatively affected.
Still, studies present somewhat contradicting results about children’s language
development outcomes associated with maternal postpartum depression. In the study by
Quevedo et al. (2011), the association between maternal postpartum depression and
children’s language development was evaluated at 30 to 90 days after delivery and at 12
months after delivery. The results showed that delayed language development of
children at 12 months of age was significantly associated with maternal postpartum
depression. Children of mothers who suffered from postpartum depression scored lower
on the language development scale compared to children who had been exposed to
mother’s depression only at one occasion or not at all. Importantly, another study
showed small or no effects of maternal postpartum depression on children’s early
language development (Cornish et al., 2005).
Another hypothesis is that exposure to maternal depression have different effects on
children’s language development in families with a different SES (Kurstjens & Wolke,
2001), still the amount of studies regarding this subject is rather small. In the study of
Kurstjens et al. (2001), children in families with a lower SES and with mothers
suffering from postpartum depression, had lower language scores compared to their
peers in families with a higher SES. Furthermore, Stein et al. (2008) found that maternal
postpartum depression was associated with poorer language development, but only
indirectly as a result of poorer caregiving related to the maternal postpartum depression.
Later, when the sample in the study was split by the effect of socioeconomic factors, the
effect of depression and caregiving was remarkably stronger for children in families
with a lower SES. The results from these studies indicates that the effect of maternal
postpartum depression on children’s language development might differ in different
SES-groups but data especially among young children at their early stages of speech
and language development is scarce.

1.4 Aim of the thesis
The aim of this study was to explore the association between the socioeconomic status
(SES) of the mother and the language development of children at 14 months of age. In
addition, the thesis explored whether the association between mothers’ postpartum
depression and children’s language development differs depending on the mothers’
SES. Examining the influence of environmental factors on children’s language
development is of importance in prevention and intervention purposes. This study also
provides follow-up information about the effects of maternal depression on children’s
language development (Bruun, 2019) but in our case during the postpartum period.

2 Method
The present study is a sub-study of the FinnBrain research project. FinnBrain is an
ongoing cohort study that has gathered information about Finnish children and their
families with the aim of studying the combined influence of environmental and genetic
factors on children’s development from the prenatal period until adolescence
(https://sites.utu.fi/finnbrain/en/). The study consists of 3837 families from Southwest
Finland and the Åland Islands. The Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of
Southwest Finland has approved the FinnBrain study protocol.

2.1 Participants and data gathering
The mothers and their partners were recruited during pregnancy via health clinics at the
time of their first ultrasonography appointment, between 2010-2015. Information
regarding the families and their children are collected via questionnaires, registers,
physiological measures and study visits. The participants consisted of both Finnish- and
Swedish-speaking families, altogether 3837 families.
For the current analysis, the data about the mothers’ SES, their child’s receptive and
expressive vocabulary, as well as use of gestures at 14 months of age and the mothers’
level of depression 1 year postpartum was used. Mothers with missing information on
their education, depressive symptoms, and language development of their child were
excluded.

Additionally, due to differences concerning the number of words in the language
measurement forms for Finnish- and Swedish-speaking children, only the data from the
Finnish-speaking children were included in the current analysis. Lastly, premature
children defined as born before gestational week 37 (Parikka et al., 2017, p. 9) were
excluded, leaving 1096 participants. The children in the sample consisted of 52% boys
(n = 710) and 48% girls (n = 631). The participants and the exclusion criteria are
presented in the flow chart in figure 1.

2.2 Measures
The outcome variable consisted of the expressive and receptive vocabulary as well as
use of actions and gestures of the children, measured by the Finnish version MacArthur
Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI) (Fenson et al., 1993; the Finnish
version by Lyytinen, 1999). In the present study, maternal education was used as a
measurement of socioeconomic status and formed the predictor variable. Furthermore,
the total sum score of self- reported depressive symptoms assessed by the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox, Holden & Sagovsky, 1987) was used as an
additional predictor variable.

2.2.1 MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories
The Finnish version (Lyytinen, 1999) of the MacArthur Communicative Development
Inventories (MCDI) (Fenson et al. 1993) form was used to collect information about the
children’s language and communication development in the present study. The MCDI is
a widely used parental report instrument for examining the communicative skills of
infants between 8-16 months of age and toddlers between 16-30 months of age. In the
current study the infant version was used. Parents were asked to complete the form
when the children were 14 months of age.

The first sections of the MCDI form (A-C), measures the child’s ability to respond to
simple questions and instructions given by the parents and attempts of imitation of
parent’s speech. The D-section measures the child’s receptive and expressive
vocabulary. This part includes a vocabulary checklist of 380 words, with two separate
columns for comprehension and production. Parents mark those words that the child
understands, or both understands and produces. According to Lyytinen (1999), the mean
value of Finnish children’s receptive vocabulary at 14 months of age is 163.6 words and
for expressive vocabulary 17.0 words. The second part of the form measures preverbal
communicative skills such as actions and gestures. Since infants do not necessarily use
verbal language at this age, this part provides important information also about their
non-verbal communication. The first section (A) measures early communicative
gestures, with the options “not yet”, “sometimes” or “often”. The remaining sections
(B-E) measure communicative gestures in play situations, actions with objects and
imitation of adults’ actions, with “yes” or “no” options. The mean value of children’s
actions and gestures are, for Finnish children at 14 months of age, 40.4 (Lyytinen,
1999).
2.2.2 Socioeconomic Status
Varying ways of measuring socioeconomic status (SES) have been proposed (Bradley et
al., 2002; Pace et al., 2016). In the current study, maternal level of education was used
as a measurement of SES. According to Shavers (2007), the level of education is one of
the most widely used indicators of SES and is often referred to as the most basic
component of SES due to its impact on future occupational opportunities. Education as
an indicator of SES also has the advantage of being easily accessible and excluding only
few members of the population. According to Westerlund and Lagerberg (2008),
maternal education is a particularly influential component since the mothers tend to be
intensively involved in daily interactions with the child. In the present study, three
socioeconomic groups were created. The first group consisted of mothers who
completed or completed parts of elementary school, high school or graduated from a
vocational school (low SES group). The second group consisted of mothers who
graduated from a higher vocational school (mid SES group) and lastly, the third group
consisted of mothers who had a lower or higher university degree or a doctoral degree
(high SES group).

2.2.3 The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
Information regarding depressive symptoms of the mothers was collected with The
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox, Holden & Sagovsky, 1987).
Mothers were asked to complete the form at three occasions prenatally, during
pregnancy week 14, 24 and 34, and at three occasions postnatally, 3, 6 and 12 months
after childbirth. Since the present study evaluates the effect of mothers’ postpartum
depression, only the data regarding the postpartum period was included. The selfreporting questionnaire consists of 10 statements about the mother’s feelings during the
past 7 days. The mother chooses one out of four alternatives that are closest to her
experienced feelings during those days. The alternatives are scored from 0-3 and are
based on their seriousness. When adding together the scores for each of the 10 items the
maximum score is 30 points. According to Matthey, Henshaw, Elliott and Barnett
(2006), the recommended cut-off point for postpartum depression is 10 points or more
and is therefore used in the present study.
Since the effect of the mothers’ postpartum depression was one of the main factors
studied, the results from the depression questionnaire filled in one year postpartum was
mostly relevant to use since it is the closest time to the children’s language
measurement, which was when the children were 14 months. Unfortunately, not all
mothers completed the form at this point but some of them had filled in the
questionnaire at 6 months after delivery and some only after 3 months of delivery. To
avoid exclusion of the mothers who might have suffered from depression but did not
complete the form at one year postpartum, a new variable was created that also included
responses from the mothers who only completed the form at 6 or 3 months postpartum.
The decision to combine the responses was made to increase the chance of receiving a
more reliable result. At 12 months postpartum, 1399 responses from the mothers’ EPDS
form were collected. At 6 months, 217 responses were collected and at 3 months, 88
responses were collected, leaving a total of 1704 responses from the EPDS form.
However, 296 of them had not completed the MCDI form and 312 of them and had to
be excluded from the study for other reasons (see Figure 1).

2.3 Statistical analyses
The relationship between children’s language development and the SES were examined
by a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Altogether three separate models were
computed which differed with respect to the outcome variable of interest. In the first
model, the MCDI receptive vocabulary score served as the outcome variable, whereas
the MCDI expressive vocabulary score served as outcome variable in the second model.
In the third model, the MCDI use of gestures score served as the outcome variable. The
confounders and the predictors in the three models were exactly the same.
The hierarchical multiple analyses were performed in a two-step procedure, by first
entering the potential confounders in the first step and then the predictor variable SES in
the second step. Potential confounders that were controlled for were gender, gestational
weeks, mother’s age and her use of smoking. Smoking during pregnancy was dummy
coded, so that those mothers who reported smoking at some point during pregnancy
were categorized as “smokers”, and those mothers not reporting smoking at all during
pregnancy were categorized as “non-smokers” (see Figure 2).
The second part of the study was to examine whether associations between maternal
postpartum depression and children’s language development was altered depending on
the mother’s SES. Here, we employed three separate two-way ANOVAs where the
respective language variable of interest served as the outcome variable (i.e., expressive
vocabulary, receptive vocabulary, and use of gestures). In all models, the EPDS scores
were dummy coded. Those mothers who reported EPDS scores > 10 were classified as
depressed, whereas those mothers who reported EPDS scores < 10 were classified as
non-depressed (see Figure 3). All statistical analyses for the current thesis were carried
out by the IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25).

3 Results
3.1 Descriptive statistics
The highest SES-group consisted of 426 mothers (38.9%), the mid SES- group
consisted of 312 mothers (28.4%) and the low SES-group consisted of 358 mothers
(32.7%). The mean length of gestation was 40 weeks (SD =1.23, range= 5.43) and the
mothers mean age when giving birth was 31 years (SD= 4.5, range= 27). In the current
sample, the prevalence of smoking at some point of pregnancy was 14% (n= 153).
At 14 months of age, the average receptive vocabulary of the children consisted of 120
words (SD = 73, range = 336) and the average expressive vocabulary consisted of 10
words (SD = 11, range = 54). The average use of gestures was 36 (SD = 9, range =
54). These findings were expected since children at this age are typically able to
understand more than they can produce and therefore also use more non-verbal
communication. Descriptive statistics for the MCDI is shown in Table 1.

A significant difference was found in the MCDI scores of girls and boys. An
independent samples t-test revealed that girls scored significantly higher than boys on
all language parts (Receptive vocabulary: t(1094) = -3.645, p < .001, Expressive

The combined variable for the EPDS results consisted of 1081 answers. The average
score of the sample was 5 points (SD = 4, range = 27). The prevalence of mothers
being depressed (i.e., scoring > 10 points in EPDS) for the whole sample was 13.5% (n
= 153). There were slightly more depressed mothers in the low SES-category (n = 61,
5.7%), compared to the mid (n = 43, 4.0 %) and high (n = 40, 3.8 %) SES-groups. The
prevalence of smoking at some point of pregnancy was also higher in the lower SESgroup (n = 102, 28.5 %) compared to the mid (n = 26, 8.3%) and high (n = 25, 5.9%)
SES-groups.

3.2 Correlations
Correlational analyses showed a non-significant correlation between SES and receptive
vocabulary at 14 months of age (r = 0.048, p = .113). Likewise, a non-significant

Rebecka Rönnblad

16

correlation between SES and expressive vocabulary was found (r = -0.010, p = .736)
and between SES and use of gestures (r = 0.003, p = .930).
The EPDS-scores significantly correlated with receptive vocabulary (r = -0.080, p =
.008) but not with the expressive vocabulary (r = .009, p = .771) or use of gestures (r = 0.010, p = .738).

3.3 Receptive vocabulary
The collinearity statistics were all within accepted limits (r < 0.7), and the assumption
of multicollinearity was therefore met. Very weak, statistically significant correlations
were observed between gender and receptive vocabulary (r = 0.110, p < .001) and
between gestational weeks and receptive vocabulary (r = 0.093, p < .001). Maternal age
was negatively associated with smoking (r = -0.141, p < .001). SES was also negatively
associated with smoking (r = -0.270, p < .001).
A statistically significant regression equation was found for the first stage which
included the control variables F(4, 1091) = 7.528, p < .001, and accounted for 2.7% of
the variance in the outcome variable (R2adj = 0.023). Of these variables, gender (β =
0.107, p < .001), gestational weeks (β = 0.096, p = .001) and maternal smoking (β = 0.080, p = .008) significantly predicted the receptive vocabulary (Table 3). Adding SES
to the model at stage 2, did not significantly increase R2adj, F(5, 1090) = 0.590, p = .443.

A two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of SES and mother’s
depression on receptive vocabulary. The results showed a statistically non-significant
main effect of depression F(1, 1075) = 3.064, p = .080, 𝜂2𝑝 = .003. Likewise, the main
effect of SES on receptive vocabulary was non-significant F(2, 1075) = 1.152, p = .316,
𝜂2𝑝 = .002. There was no evidence for any interaction between maternal SES and
depression on child’s receptive vocabulary, F(2, 1075) = .026, p = .974, 𝜂2𝑝 = .000.

3.4 Expressive vocabulary
Because the data on expressive vocabulary was not normally distributed, this variable
was transformed using the square root log transformation. This procedure was
performed to deal with the skewness of the distribution. Extreme outliers were also
excluded for those participants who scored three times the interquartile range below the
1st or above the 3rd quartile. After performing these adjustments, the assumptions for
multiple regression was met.
The collinearity statistics were all within accepted limits (r < 0.7), the assumption of
multicollinearity was therefore met. Very weak, statistically significant correlations

Rebecka Rönnblad

18

were observed between gender and expressive vocabulary (r = 0.158, p < .001) and
between gestational weeks and expressive vocabulary (r = 0.071, p = .009). Maternal
age correlated negatively with expressive vocabulary (r = 0.071, p = .009). Maternal age
was also negatively associated with smoking (r = -0.141, p < .001) and SES was
positively associated with maternal age (r = 0.236, p < .001).
A statistically significant regression equation was found for the first stage which
included the control variables F(4, 1091) = 9.358, p < .001, and accounted for 3.0% of
the variance in the outcome variable (R2adj = 0.030). Of these variables gender (β =
0.573, p < .001) and gestational weeks (β = 0.096, p < .001) significantly predicted
expressive vocabulary (Table 4). Adding SES to the model at stage 2, did not
significantly increase R2adj, F(5, 1090) = 0.045, p = .833.

effect of SES on expressive vocabulary was non-significant F(2, 1075) = .408, p = .665,

𝜂2𝑝 = .001. Finally, no evidence on interaction between maternal SES and depression on
expressive vocabulary was observed, F(2, 1075) = .384, p = .681, 𝜂2𝑝 = .001.

3.5 Use of gestures
The collinearity statistics were all within accepted limits (r < 0.7), the assumption of
multicollinearity was therefore met. Very weak, statistically significant correlations was
observed between gender and the use of gestures (r = 0.198, p < .001) and between
gestational weeks and use of gestures (r = 0.137, p < .001). Maternal age was
negatively associated with smoking (r = -0.140, p < .001) and SES was positively
associated with both maternal age (r = 0.336, p < .001) and children’s gender (r =
0.052, p < .001).
A statistically significant regression equation was found for the first stage which
included the control variables F(4, 1055) = 16.093, p < .001, and accounted for 5.4% of
the variance in the outcome variable (R2adj = .054). Of these variables gender (β =
0.195, p < .001) and gestational weeks (β = 0.134, p < .001) significantly predicted the
use of gestures (Table 5). Adding SES to the model at stage 2, did not significantly
increase R2adj, F(5, 1054) = .191, p = .662.

4 Discussion
The aim of the thesis was to explore the association between the socioeconomic status
of the mother and the language development of children at 14 months of age in
Southwest Finland. In addition, the thesis explored whether the effect of the mothers’
postpartum depression on children’s language development differs dependent on the
mothers’ SES. When controlling for the confounding variables, no evidence on

Rebecka Rönnblad

21

interaction between maternal SES and children’s language development was found. The
results show no statistically significant association between the mothers’ SES and
children’s receptive or expressive vocabulary, neither with their use of gestures at 14
months of age. It appears that the selected confounding variables explain the variations
in language development among children to a greater extent than SES, the main
predictor. The confounding variables such as gender, gestational weeks, mother’s age
and smoking during pregnancy was shown to have a certain impact on language
development. The results also indicate that the influence of mothers’ postpartum
depression on children’s language development was independent of maternal SES or
level of education.

4.1 Socioeconomic status and language development
The current findings do not demonstrate a significant impact of the mothers’ SES on
children’s language development in the current sample. There seems to be variation in
how the SES affects children’s language development in different countries and
cultures. The findings in the current study differ from the results of several studies
conducted in the US (Fernald et al., 2013; Noble et al., 2007; Pungello et al., 2009). One
reason for this result could be, as previous studies have suggested, that the SES might
not have the same effect on children’s language development in countries where
families have access to high-quality health care and where education is more equal for
all citizens (Adler et al., 1999; Pace et al., 2017). In other words, in countries where the
socioeconomic discrepancies are not significant, the effect might not be as evident.
Finland is often referred to as one of the countries known for its high-quality and equal
health care and education system (Halinen & Järvinen, 2008; Järvelin, 2002). Other
studies performed in the Nordic countries have presented no statistically significant
results of this relationship. For instance, in the study by Berglund, Eriksson &
Westerlund, (2005), the conclusion was that SES was not associated with significant
differences in early communicative skills in Swedish-speaking children at 18 months of
age. Westerlund et al. (2008) also concluded that no association was found between
maternal education as their marker of SES, and a child’s vocabulary at 17-19 months of
age. However, they found that the frequency of mothers reading to their children was
highly increased with rising maternal education. Although, in the study by Eilertsen,

Rebecka Rönnblad

22

Thorsen, Holm, Bøe, Sørensen, and Lundervold (2016), significant results could be
found of the relationship between SES and children’s verbal comprehension in a
Norwegian sample. Despite this, they highlighted that compared to the results from
other non-Nordic countries, the strength of the relation was in this case weaker.
Another factor that is worth taking into consideration is the age of the children in the
study population. A majority of previous studies reporting statistically significant results
on associations between the mothers’ SES and children’s language development have
included children at ages above 14 months. Therefore, it is possible that the influences
of SES on children’s communicative skills could also emerge in the current population
only as the children get older. For instance, in the study by Reilly et al. (2009), maternal
education was not associated with children’s language development at 24 months of
age. Furthermore, in the previously mentioned study by Vasilyeva et al. (2008),
differences in the SES-groups were not noticeable until 26 months of age when the
children in the higher SES-group used more complex sentences compared to their peers
in the lower SES-group. In Zambrana, Ystrom, and Pons’s (2012) study, a main effect
of SES was found on children’s language comprehension at 18 and 36 months of age,
but the effect was also shown to be stronger with increasing age and was substantial at
36 months of age. Moreover, Berglund et al. (2005) highlighted the suggestion based
on previous studies that the effect of SES is likely to increase with increasing age both
in childhood and adolescence. These findings suggest that the effect of SES might be
possible also in Finnish children participating in this study but that it is not evident
because they are only 14 months old and their language development is in its early
stage.
However, it is important to highlight the fact that the SES of the family is a
multidimensional factor that covary with many other factors that influence the language
development of the children. The causational relations of the SES effects are still
unclear and therefore, making conclusive assumptions is challenging (Hoff et al., 2002).

4.2 Maternal postpartum depression and children’s language development
in different socioeconomic groups
The influence of the mothers’ postpartum depressive symptoms on children’s language
development did not significantly differ depending on the mothers’ SES. In other

Rebecka Rönnblad

23

words, even if SES is considered as a risk factor for depressive symptoms (Goyal et al.,
2010), and studies present that maternal postpartum depression has an influence on
children’s language development, the result from the present study indicates that the
effect of the mothers’ postpartum depression on children’s language development does
not differ depending on the mothers’ SES.
The prevalence of reported depressive symptoms among the mothers in the current
sample was consistent with other prevalence reports regarding maternal postpartum
depression (O'hara & McCabe, 2013). In this sample, the prevalence of depression was
observed to be higher in mothers with a lower SES, which is also consistent with
previous literature (Freeman et al., 2016; Serge et al., 2007), although the language
development of their children did not significantly differ compared to the other groups.
In the study by Goyal et al. (2010), mothers with a lower SES were associated with
more depressive symptoms at 2 and 3 months postpartum compared to the mothers in
the higher SES-group. According to the researchers, this result might be due to the lack
of resources available to low SES mothers, (e.g. medical care, transportation, partner
support). As previously mentioned, whether the effect of SES is evident or not in
countries with a high-quality health care system has been discussed. According to
Järvelin (2002), the quality of the Finnish health care is in general of a high standard.
Every Finnish citizen has the right to health services regardless of ability to pay or place
of residence and the public authorities are obligated to guarantee everyone adequate
social, health and medical service. In other words, regardless of one’s SES, one is
entitled to the same health care. Mothers in Finland also have equal access to both
prenatal and postnatal visits at a maternity clinic (Ministry of Labour, 1997) and from a
survey made by Kojo-Austin, Malin and Hemminki (1993), women in Finland are, in
general, satisfied with the maternity health care. Taking this into consideration, it may
be that despite a higher prevalence of postpartum depression in the lower SES-group,
the mothers’ socioeconomic status does not interfere with their children’s language
development because, as previously discussed, SES is not shown to be a strong
predictor for the children’s language development in this study population.
Smith-Nielsen, Tharner, Krogh and Væver (2016), studied the long-term effect of
maternal postpartum depression on children’s language development. Their sample
consisted of well-resourced and highly educated mothers and their children. The results
showed no long-term effect of postpartum depression diagnosed 3-4 months postpartum

Rebecka Rönnblad

24

on children’s language development at 13 months of age. These findings can be related
to the present study, since the majority of the participants also mostly consisted of
mothers with a higher SES.
In the pro gradu study by Bruun (2018), the relationship between prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms and infant vocabulary was explored in a partially overlapping
population as in the present study. The result indicated that the prenatal EPDS-scores
correlated significantly with children´s receptive vocabulary at 14 months, but not with
expressive vocabulary. Although when the confounders were held constant, prenatal
depressive symptoms in mothers did not significantly predict later vocabulary
development in children. Consistent with this, a similar trend was found in the present
study. The EPDS-scores from postpartum period correlate significantly with children´s
receptive vocabulary at 14 months of age. However, in combination with the SES
variable, no significant effect of mothers’ depression on children’s language
development was found.

4.3 Confounders
From the statistical analyses, it could be seen that several confounders predicted
language development outcomes both in combination with the SES variable and by
themselves. Since the SES of the mother did not significantly predict the outcomes in
children’s language development, the other confounders are likely to better explain
differences in the children’s language development.
In previous literature, gender differences have been well-documented in children’s
language development. Consistent with this, gender differences were found also in the
present study. According to the MCDI results, girls scored significantly higher than
boys. Gender was, in this study, shown to be a significant predictor for language
development, which is consistent with the study by Korpilahti et al. (2016), who
explored several risk factors for later language development in another Finnish cohort
study. In their study, gender was shown to be the most powerful biological factor in
predicting language delays.
Furthermore, gestational weeks were shown to be another significant predictor for
language development. Even though prematurely born children were excluded from the

Rebecka Rönnblad

25

present study, gestational weeks remained as significant predictors of language level at
14 months of age. Consistent with this, in the study by Stene-Larsen et al. (2014),
children not born premature but early term were at an increased risk for communication
impairments at 18 and 36 months of age. This suggests that children born early term are
also at risk of delayed speech and language development.
The mothers’ age in combination with the SES variable also revealed a statistically
significant effect on the expressive vocabulary. Although, this finding must be
interpreted with caution since the expressive vocabulary variable was transformed.
Lastly, smoking in combination with SES showed a statistically significant association
with the receptive vocabulary and as it was shown in this sample, smoking during
pregnancy did occur more often in the lower SES-group, which is consistent with
previous studies, suggesting that the prevalence of smoking is higher in the lower SESgroups (Ekblad et al., 2013).

4.4 Limitations of the study and plans for future research
Despite the advantage of a large sample size, the study had some limitations. In this
study, only maternal education was used as a measurement of SES. Other factors could
have been included to extend the measurement of the SES, (e.g. income, occupation).
Although, maternal education is often used as a measurement itself, the combination of
several factors may have formed a more reliable measurement of the SES. Including
both parents’ education might also have been beneficial to estimate the effects of SES.
For instance, in the study by Korpilahti et al. (2016), the fathers’ education level was a
significant predictor of children’s language outcomes. Besides the fact that there is no
final definition of SES, neither is there an absolute way of categorizing SES (Bradley et
al., 2002; Pace et al., 2016). In this study, the responses concerning the mothers’ SES
was originally categorized on a nine-point scale and was later converted into a threepoint scale. This type of categorization might have caused uncertainties regarding the
line between the lowest and the middle group. If the categorization had been performed
in another way, the results might have differed. Furthermore, the majority of the sample
consisted of highly educated mothers and therefore little variance in the predictors is to
be expected since the likelihood of observing interactions is lower when the population
is rather homogenous.

Rebecka Rönnblad

26

The EPDS-results were combined into one variable to create a broader and more
generalizable sample. However, there is no guarantee that all the mothers who suffered
from depression were included, since not all mothers completed the EPDS form up to 1
year postpartum. Information regarding the mothers’ use of medication or whether they
received any form of therapy during this period was not included either. Studies have
shown that different intervention methods such as group therapy and cognitive
behavioural therapy have been successful methods in reducing depressive symptoms
among mothers with postpartum depression (Cho, Kwon & Lee, 2008; Mulcahy, Reay,
Wilkinson & Owen, 2009; Zlotnick, Johnson, Miller, Pearlstein & Howard, 2001). This
could possibly have affected the result in this study if any of the mothers received
therapy during the postpartum period.
In future studies about these associations, it would be recommended to include more
variables for the measurement of SES as well as more background information about
the mothers. To further investigate the influence of maternal SES on Finnish children’s
language development, additional studies also comprising older children are needed as
previous research suggests that the effect are more prominent with increasing child’s
age.
4.5 Conclusion
This study found no support for the association between the mothers’ SES and
children’s language development at 14 months of age. The effect of SES is possibly not
as evident in Finland compared to countries with larger socioeconomic discrepancies or
the effect of SES is not yet possible to see in children’s language development as early
as 14 months of age. Neither did the influence of mother’s postpartum depression on
children’s language development differ by maternal SES measured with level of
education. Further background information regarding the mothers’ use of medication or
received therapy because of postpartum depression should be collected to be able to
draw reliable conclusions about this effect. Language development is a process which is
formed by a combination of factors, not by one alone. Future studies should explore
long-term effects of SES on children’s language development and follow-up the
children for long-term outcomes because the effects of SES can probably not be seen
until the language development has proceeded a little bit further.

Swedish summary - Svensk sammanfattning
Effekten av mammans socioekonomiska status och postpartumdepression
på barns tidiga språkutveckling
1 Introduktion
Barns språkutveckling formas i första hand av biologiska faktorer men influeras även av
barnets omgivning (Hoff, 2006). Biologiska faktorer som exempelvis kön har visats
påverka språkutvecklingen (Eriksson m.fl., 2012). Prematuritet samt för tidig födsel
under vecka 37–39 har även visats vara en risk för försenad språkutveckling (Bruun,
2019; Foster-Cohen m.fl., 2007; Lee m.fl., 2011; Schirmer m.fl., 2006). Det finns också
studier som tyder på att mammans ålder kan inverkan på barns språkutveckling, där
lägre ålder hos mamman associeras med lägre språklig nivå hos barnet (Keown,
Woodward & Fielda, 2001). Även rökning under graviditeten har konstaterats ha en
negativ inverkan på barns språkutveckling (Key m.fl., 2007).
En omgivningsfaktor som har uppmärksammats är familjens socioekonomiska status
(SES) och dess inverkan på barns allmänna utveckling och hälsa. Trots flertalet studier
angående sambandet finns det ingen slutgiltig definition av termen som forskare är
överens om (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002) men oftast baserar sig termen antingen på
utbildning, yrke eller inkomst (Adler & Ostrove, 1999; Noble, McCandliss, & Farah,
2007; Raviv, Kessenich & Morison, 2004). Familjer med högre SES har i de flesta fall
större möjlighet att förse sina barn med de basbehov som krävs för en god utveckling
och stimulerande miljöer för barnets språkutveckling (Bornstein & Bradley, 2002).
Skillnader i familjens SES kan därför innebära att språkutvecklingen påverkas på olika
sätt. Ett flertal studier har visat skillnader i barns språkutveckling i olika SES-grupper
(Fernald, Marchman & Weisleder, 2013; Korpilahti, Kaljonen & Jansson-Verkasalo,
2016; Noble m.fl., 2007; Pungello, Iruka, Dotterer, Mills-Koonce & Reznick, 2009)
men det råder fortfarande osäkerheter angående i vilken ålder som skillnaderna börjar
framkomma och exakt vad det är med SES som påverkar språkutvecklingen.
Studier har även visat att mammor i lägre SES-grupper löper högre risk att lida av
någon form av depression i jämförelse med mammor i högre SES-grupper (Goyal, Gay
& Lee, 2010; Serge, O’Hara, Arndt & Stuart, 2007). Postpartumdepression innebär en
typ av depression som kan uppkomma under första året efter förlossning (World Health

Rebecka Rönnblad

28

Organization, 2018). Mammans depressiva symtom antingen under eller efter
förlossning kan utgöra en risk för försenad språkutveckling hos barn (Paulson m.fl.,
2009). Studier uppvisar motstridiga resultat angående sambandet mellan mammans
postpartumdepression och barnets tidiga språkutveckling (Cornish m.fl., 2005; Quevedo
m.fl., 2011). Det finns även en hypotes om att mammans depressiva symptom har olika
effekt på barns språkutveckling i olika SES-grupper (Kurstjens m.fl., 2001). Studier har
visat att barn i familjer med lägre SES och där mamman har diagnostiserats med
postpartumdepression, uppvisar lägre poäng i språkliga test i jämförelse med
motsvarande barn i familjer med en högre SES (Kurstjens & Wolke, 2001; Stein,
Malmberg, Sylva, Barnes & Leach, 2008)

1.2 Syfte med studien
Syftet med studien var att undersöka sambandet mellan mammans socioekonomiska
status (SES) och barns språkutveckling vid 14 månaders ålder. Därtill undersöktes det i
studien hurvida associationen mellan mammans postpartumdepression och barnets
språkutveckling påverkas på olika sätt i olika socioekonomiska grupper.

2 Metod
Studien genomfördes som en delstudie av forskningsprojektet FinnBrain, vars syfte är
att undersöka den kombinerade effekten av gener och miljö på finländska barns
utveckling (https://sites.utu.fi/finnbrain/sv/). Studien bestod av 3837 familjer från
sydvästra Finland och Åland. Mammorna och deras partners rekryterades vid deras
första ultraljudsundersökning mellan åren 2010–2015. Deltagarna bestod av både finskoch svenskspråkiga familjer. För analyserna i studien krävdes information angående
mammornas SES, deras barns receptiva och expressiva ordförråd, deras användning av
gester vid 14 månaders ålder samt mammornas depressionsnivå ett år efter förlossning.
Mammorna som inte hade fyllt i något av formulären exkluderades. Eftersom
formuläret som kartlägger barnens språkutveckling skiljer sig åt för finsk- och
svenskspråkiga barn angående antal ord, inkluderades enbart de finskspråkiga barnen.
Slutligen exkluderades även prematura barn som var födda före vecka 37. Därav blev
det slutliga antalet deltagare 1096. Barnen i samplet bestod av 52 % pojkar (n = 710)
och 48 % flickor (n = 631).

2.1 Mätinstrument
Den finska versionen (Lyytinen, 1999) av MacArthur Communicative Development
Inventories (MCDI-formuläret) (Fenson m.fl., 1993) användes för att samla in
information om barnens språkliga och kommunikativa utveckling vid 14 månaders ålder
och utgjorde resultatvariablerna för studien. Den första delen av formuläret mäter
barnets receptiva och expressiva ordförråd. Föräldrarna kryssar i de ord som barnet
förstår eller både förstår och producerar. I den andra delen av formuläret (A-E) mäts
barnets preverbala kommunikation och användning av gester. Delen består av ”ja eller
nej”- alternativ angående barnets användning av gester. Mammornas utbildning
fungerade som ett mått på deras SES och utgjorde därav prediktorvariablen i alla
analyser.
Information angående mammornas upplevda depressiva symptom samlades in med
hjälp av screeningtestet Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (Cox, Holden &
Sagovsky, 1987) och utgjorde den andra prediktorvariabeln. Formuläret baseras på 10
påståenden om mammans upplevda tankar och känslor under de senaste sju dagarna.
Mamman väljer ett utav fyra svarsalternativ där varje svarsalternativ poängsätts och där
högre poäng tyder på svårare depressiva symptom. Den totala poängen för testet utgörs
av 30 poäng och det rekommenderade gränsvärdet för depression är enligt Matthey,
Henshaw, Elliott och Barnett (2006) 10 poäng eller mera. Mammorna fyllde i
formuläret 3, 6 och 12 månader efter förlossning. Responsen från formuläret ett år efter
förlossning var det mest relevanta eftersom tidpunkten var närmast när barnet var 14
månader gammalt. Däremot hade inte alla mammor fyllt i formuläret vid ett år efter
förlossning och för deras del användes det svaret som de hade gett vid sex månader efter
förlossningen och om det också saknades användes det svar som de hade gett vid tre
månader efter förlossning. Enligt EPDS-svaren delades mammorna in i två grupper.
Mammorna som fick 10 poäng eller mera räknades som deprimerade och de mammor
som hade mindre än 10 poäng räknades som icke-deprimerade.
2.2 Statistiska analyser
Sambandet mellan barnens språkutveckling och mammornas SES undersöktes genom
hierarkisk multipel regression i två steg. Tre separata analyser gjordes med barnens
receptiva och expressiva ordförråd samt deras användning av gester var för sig som
resultatvariabler. Förväxlingsfaktorerna kön, gestationsveckor, mammans ålder och

Rebecka Rönnblad

30

rökning under graviditeten matades in i steg 1 och var detsamma i alla analyser. Vid
steg 2 matades mammans SES in som prediktorvariabel.
Den andra delen av studien undersökte hurvida associationen mellan mammans
postpartumdepression och barnets språkutveckling påverkas på olika sätt i olika
socioekonomiska grupper. Detta undersöktes med hjälp av en två-vägs ANOVA där
respektive språkvariabel av intresse fungerade som resultatvariabel (receptiva
ordförrådet, expressiva ordförrådet och användning av gester).

3 Resultat
Den högsta SES-gruppen bestod av 426 mammor (38,9 %), den mittersta SES-gruppen
bestod av 312 mammor (28,4 %) och den lägsta SES-gruppen bestod av 358 mammor
(32,7 %). Den genomsnittliga längden för graviditet var 40 veckor (SD = 1,23,
variationsvidd = 5,43) och mammornas genomsnittliga ålder vid förlossning var 31 år
(SD = 4,5, variationsvidd = 27). Av mammorna i samplet hade 14 % (n = 153) rökt i
något skede av graviditeten.
Vid 14 månaders ålder bestod barnens genomsnittliga receptiva ordförråd av 120 ord
(SD = 73, variationsvidd = 336) och det genomsnittliga expressiva ordförrådet bestod
av 10 ord (SD = 11, variationsvidd = 54). Den genomsnittliga användningen av gester
var 36 (SD = 9, variationsvidd = 54). Flickornas resultat från MCDI-formuläret var
signifikant högre än pojkarnas inom alla språkområden (Receptivt ordförråd: t(1094)= 3,645, p < .001, Expressivt ordförråd: t(1094)= -5,309, p < .001, Användning av gester:
t(1058)= -6,570, p < .001).
EPDS-resultaten bestod av 1081 svar. Den genomsnittliga poängen för samplet var 5
poäng (SD = 4, variationsvidd = 27). Prevalensen för depression (> 10 poäng i EPDSformuläret) var för hela samplet 13,5 % (n = 153). Mammorna i den lägsta SES-gruppen
uppvisade något högre prevalens av depression (n = 61, 5,7 %) i jämförelse med den
mittersta (n = 43, 4,0 %) och höga (n = 40, 3,8 %) SES-gruppen. Förekomsten av
rökning under något skede av graviditeten var också högre i den lägsta SES-gruppen (n
= 102, 28,5 %) i jämförelse med den mittersta (n = 26, 8,3 %) och höga (n = 25, 5,9 %)
SES-gruppen.

31

Korrelationsanalyserna visade att det inte fanns ett statistiskt signifikant samband
mellan SES och barnens receptiva ordförråd (r = 0,048, p = 0,113), inte heller mellan
SES och barnens expressiva ordförråd (r = -0,010, p = 0,736) eller deras användning av
gester (r = 0,003, p = 0,930). EPDS-resultaten korrelerade signifikant med det receptiva
ordförrådet (r = -0,080, p = 0,008) men inte med det expressiva ordförrådet (r = 0,009,
p = 0,771) eller deras användning av gester (r = -0,010, p = 0,738).
Antagandena för att utföra en multipel regressionsanalys uppfylldes med det receptiva
ordförrådet som resultatvariabel. Alla parvisa korrelationer var inom accepterad nivå (r
< 0,7). Det första steget uppvisade en statistiskt signifikant regressionsekvation F(4,
1091) = 7,528, p < 0,001, och svarade för 2,3 % av variansen i resultatvariabeln
(R2justerat = 0,023). När SES-variabeln tillades i steg två förändrades inte F på en
statistiskt signifikant nivå (R2justerat = 0,590, p = 0,443). Modellen föreslår alltså att
mammans SES inte förklarar en betydande del av variansen i barnens receptiva
ordförråd efter att bakgrundsfaktorer har tagits i beaktande. Vid båda stegen predicerade
barnets kön (β = 0,107, p < 0,001), antal gestationsveckor (β = 0,096, p = 0,001) och
rökning under graviditeten (β = -0,080, p = 0,008) resultatvariabeln på en statistiskt
signifikant nivå.
För att möjliggöra en regressionsanalys med det expressiva ordförrådet som
resultatvariabel genomfördes en kvadratrotstransformering. Deltagare med extrema
värden, tre gånger kvartilavståndet ovanför eller under den första och tredje kvartilen
exkluderades. Det första steget i analysen uppvisade en statistiskt signifikant
regressionsekvation F(4, 1091) = 9,358, p < 0,001, och svarade för 3,0 % av variansen i
resultatvariabeln (R2justerat = 0,030). När SES-variabeln tillades i steg två förändrades
inte F på en statistiskt signifikant nivå (R2justerat = 0,045, p = 0,833). Enbart barnets kön
(β = 0,573, p < 0,001) och antal gestationsveckor (β = 0,096, p < 0,001) predicerade
barnens expressiva ordförråd.
Antagandena för att utföra en multipel regressionsanalys uppfylldes även med barnens
användning av gester som resultatvariabel. Det första steget uppvisade en statistiskt
signifikant regressionsekvation F(4, 1055) = 16,093, p < 0,001, och svarade för 5,4 %
av variansen i resultatvariabeln (R2justerat = 0,054). När SES-variabeln tillades i steg två
förändrades inte F på en statistiskt signifikant nivå (R2justerat = 0,191, p = 0,662). Även i

Rebecka Rönnblad

32

denna analys framkom att barnets kön (β = 0,195, p < 0,001) och antal gestationsveckor
(β = 0,134, p < 0,001) predicerade barnens användning av gester.
Tvåvägs ANOVA-analyser utfördes för att undersöka effekten av mammans depression
på barnens receptiva och expressiva ordförråd samt användning av gester. Resultaten
visade en statistisk icke-signifikant huvudeffekt av depression på samtliga
språkområden (Receptivt ordförråd: F(1, 1075) = 3,064, p = 0,080, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,003,
Expressivt ordförråd: F(1, 1075) = 0,447, p = 0,504, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,000, Användning av gester:
F(1, 1041) = 1,977, p = 0,160, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,002). Likaså var huvudeffekten av SES på barnens
receptiva och expressiva ordförråd samt användning av gester icke-signifikant,
(Receptivt ordförråd: F(2, 1075) = 1,152, p = 0,316, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,002, Expressivt ordförråd:
F(2, 1075) = 0,408, p = 0,665, 𝜂2𝑝 = .001, Användning av gester: F(2, 1041) = 1,384, p =
0,251, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,003). Det fanns inte heller någon statistisk signifikant interaktion mellan
effekten av SES och mammans depression på barnens receptiva och expressiva
ordförråd samt användning av gester (Receptivt ordförråd: F(2, 1075) = 0,026, p =
0,974, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,000, Expressivt ordförråd: F(2, 1075) = 0,384, p = 0,681, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,001,
Användning av gester: F(2, 1041) = 1,628, p = 0,197, 𝜂2𝑝 = 0,003).

4 Diskussion
Syftet med den här studien var att undersöka sambandet mellan mammans
socioekonomiska status och barns språkutveckling vid 14 månaders ålder. Därtill
undersöktes det i studien hurvida associationen mellan mammans postpartumdepression
och barnets språkutveckling påverkas på olika sätt i olika socioekonomiska grupper.
Efter att bakgrundsfaktorerna tagits i beaktande visade resultatet att det inte finns en
statistisk signifikant association mellan mammans SES och barnens språkutveckling vid
14 månaders ålder. Det tyder på att de utvalda bakgrundsfaktorerna förklarar variationer
i barnens språkutveckling i större utsträckning än SES-variabeln. Bakgrundsfaktorer
som kön, gestationsveckor, mammans ålder och rökning under graviditeten visade sig
ha en viss inverkan på språkutvecklingen. Orsaken till resultaten kan förklaras av att
SES inte har lika stor inverkan på barns språkutveckling i länder där familjer har
tillgång till ett sjukvårdssystem av hög standard och där tillgången till utbildning är
mera jämlik för alla invånare (Adler m.fl., 1999; Pace, Luo, Hirsh-Pasek, Michnick,

Rebecka Rönnblad

33

Golinkoff, 2017). Eftersom Finland räknas som ett land med sådana tillgångar (Halinen
& Järvinen, 2008; Järvelin, 2002) kan det förklara resultatet. En annan bidragande orsak
till resultatet kan vara barnens ålder. Majoriteten av tidigare studier som har uppvisat
statistiskt signifikanta resultat av associationen mellan mammans SES och barns
språkutveckling har inkluderat barn som var äldre än 14 månader, Vasilyeva, Waterfall
& Huttenlocher, 2008; Zambrana, Ystrom & Pons, 2012). Därför är det möjligt att
effekten av SES på barnens kommunikativa färdigheter inte ännu hade framkommit
eftersom barnen var så unga och befann sig i en tidig fas av sin språkutveckling.
Resultaten från studien visade även att effekten av mammans postpartumdepression på
barnens språkutveckling inte skiljer sig i olika socioekonomiska grupper. Resultatet kan
ha att göra med Finlands sjukvårdsystem där sjukvårdstjänster erbjuds till alla blivande
mammor oberoende av socioekonomisk tillhörighet. Av mammorna i samplet visade det
sig att prevalensen av depression var något högre i den lägsta socioekonomiska
gruppen, trots det verkade inte mammornas SES inverka på barnens språkutveckling.
Studien hade en del begränsningar. Måttet av SES som bestod av mammornas
utbildning kunde ha utvidgats till att även inkludera deras inkomst och yrke för att få ett
bredare och mera tillförlitligt mått av SES. Det kunde också ha varit fördelaktigt att
inkludera båda föräldrarnas utbildning, eftersom det har framkommit att pappans
utbildningsnivå kan vara en stark prediktor av barns språkutveckling (Korpilahti m.fl.,
2016). Kategorisering av SES-grupperna kunde också ha utförts på andra sätt. I studien
delades mammorna in i tre grupper som ursprungligen baserades på en skala med nio
nivåer av utbildning. Om en annan typ av kategorisering hade utförts kunde också ett
annat resultat ha uppvisats. Majoriteten av mammorna var dessutom högutbildade vilket
försvårar generaliserbarheten av resultaten. Information angående mammornas
användning av läkemedel och terapibesök under postpartumperioden kunde också ha
inkluderats eftersom studier har visat att olika typer av terapi har kunnat minska
mammors depressiva symptom under postpartumperioden (Cho, Kwon & Lee, 2008;
Mulcahy, Reay, Wilkinson & Owen, 2009; Zlotnick, Johnson, Miller, Pearlstein &
Howard, 2001). I framtida studier rekommenderas att undersöka långtidseffekten av
SES på barns tal- och språkutveckling.
