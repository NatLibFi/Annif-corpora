Abstract
In a world where receiving, sending and interpreting information has become faster than ever,
it is critical to develop analytical methods which perform in accordance with the society’s ever
growing needs. An increasing demand of on-site analyses has to be met in a fast, portable and
straightforward way. Ion-selective electrodes (ISE) have proven their worth as reliable, fast
and rugged analysis tools, as is shown by their extensive use in clinical and industrial analyses
[1,2]. With the increasing demand, the ion-selective electrode field keeps on extending coming up with new solutions to make electrodes easier to manufacture, easier to calibrate and
to improve their accuracy. Solid-contact ISEs (SC-ISE) are of interest because they are easy to
construct and miniaturize, because they lack an internal solution. With the appearance of solidcontact electrodes, new methods to characterize them have also emerged.
The coulometric signal read-out method has been developed due to interest in measuring
smaller changes of analyte concentrations and characterization of solid-contact ion-selective
electrodes. The method has been tested for SC-ISEs selective towards K+, H+ and Cl-.[3–5]
This work covers the creation and characterization of solid-contact sodium selective electrodes
(Na+-SCISEs), made with three different membrane thicknesses. The electrodes are
characterized with potentiometry and with the relatively new coulometric signal transduction
method. In order to study the influence of different membrane thicknesses, a spin-coating
protocol for thin membranes was developed and optimized. Three thicknesses were used in this
study – two sets of electrodes with spin-coated membranes and one set with drop-casted
membranes. The coulometric signal read-out method was used to calibrate the electrodes and
check the performance for small changes in the Na+ ion concentration. The method involves
keeping the working electrode potential constant against the reference electrode, so when a
change in the activity of the primary ion in the sample solution takes place, a difference in the
potential is caused at the membrane-solution interface. A transient current forms to compensate
for that difference, resulting from a change in the redox state of the conducting polymer solidcontact poly(3,4–ethyledioxythiophene) poly(styrene-sulphonate) (PEDOT(PSS)). The current
is integrated over time to obtain the charge, which can be related to the change in the activity
of the analyte and therefore change in concentration of the analyte ions. The Na+-SCISE in this
work were also characterized with potentiometry to confirm their functionality as well as to
compare the two methods with each other.

The three sets of Na+-selective SC-ISEs with three different membrane thicknesses were
compared both according to their performance in potentiometric and coulometric signal readout method. Based on the results, it can be concluded that spin-coated electrodes having thinner
membranes perform better with the signal read-out method, while drop-casted thick membrane
electrodes have lower detection limits and slopes closer to the Nernstian ideal in potentiometry.
Drop-casted electrode membranes had longer response time in the coulometric signal read-out
method (over 5 minutes) so the equilibrium was not reached for drop-casted electrode
measurements with coulometry in the experiments of this study. Medium-membrane electrodes
exhibited steeper slopes than thin-membrane electrodes, possibly because the resistance of the
membrane is high enough to keep unwanted side-reactions from happening.

1. Literature overview
1.1 Chemical sensors and development of ion-selective electrodes
A chemical sensor is a device that transforms the chemical input signal (i.e. activities of ions)
into an electrical output signal (i.e. electromotive force) in a quantitative/qualitative manner
(Figure 1). The sensor itself usually consists of three parts – the chemical input recognition
element (usually a membrane), the electrical signal conductor (wire, carbon rod etc.) and in
between the two elements is a transducer, which changes the chemical input signal into the
electrical output signal that is then registered. The ion of interest is usually called the primary
ion or target ion. [1,2]

Figure 1. Scheme of the principle of chemical sensing. Based on reference [1].

Ion-selective electrodes are chemical sensors that detect various ions. Over 70 analytes have
been found for ion-selective electrodes, making them a field of interest. The analytes
discovered so far include not only inorganic analytes, but also organic analytes, surfactants and
non-ionic compounds.[6,7] Due to good qualities of ISEs, ion-elective electrodes are being
improved further, in order to miniaturize them and create calibration free electrodes.[2,3,8]
An ion-selective electrode usually consists of three parts – the ion-selective membrane (ISM),
which singles out the analyte from other ions in the sample, the ion-to-electron transducer that
transforms the signal from ions to electrons and the electron conductor, which leads electrons

into the measuring device. In order to examine its performance, multiple properties are
evaluated using several methods.[1]

1.2 Characterization of ion-selective electrodes
In order to evaluate the performance of ion-selective electrodes, different parameters need to
be assessed. An important set of parameters is the working range and linear range, which can
be determined by the calibration of ion-selective electrodes. The working range is the
concentration range where the ISE gives a response. The linear range defines the range where
the response the ISE gives is linear. The calibrations from which these parameters can be
determined have been done with various methods, such as potentiometry, coulometric signal
read-out and thin-layer coulometry.[4,8,9] The principles of these methods used in this work
will be described further in this chapter.
Two other equally important parameters are the selectivity of the ion-selective electrode and
the response time.[1,6,7] The selectivity can be determined using methods that are described
in Section 1.3. The response time of the electrode can be evaluated numerically, but it is also
possible to simply describe and decide whether the electrode response is appropriate for its
intended application.[1]

1.2.1 Potentiometry
In potentiometry the difference in potential for two electrochemical half-cells is measured. It
is detected at zero current. To keep the current zero and still overcome the resistance of the
ion-selective membrane, the measurement requires a voltmeter with a high ohmic resistance
input and low input bias current.[7]
When the current is close to zero the system is at an equilibrium and polarization of electrodes
is avoided. The activity of the target ion can be related to the electromotive force of the ISE
according to the Nernst equation (1):
𝑅𝑇

𝜑 = 𝜑 0 + 𝑧 𝐹 𝑙𝑛𝑎𝐼
𝐼

(1)

Where φ is the potential of the ISE, φ0 the standard potential of the ISE (when the activity of
the ion is equal to 1), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/K*mol), T the absolute
temperature, F the Faraday constant (95485 C/mol), zI and aI the charge and activity of the
target ion respectively. The potential of an electrode cannot be measured individually, only the
difference between the reference electrode (RE) and working electrode (WE) can be measured.

9

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

The cell potential can also be expressed as the difference in potential of the reference electrode
and the working electrode: [10]
(2)

𝐸𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 = 𝐸𝑅𝐸 − 𝐸𝑊𝐸

Since the potential of the reference electrode is constant, the potential of the electrochemical
cell expresses the potential of the WE, with the potential of the RE being a part of the standard
potential and can be calculated according to Equation 3:
𝐸 = 𝐸 0 + 𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑎𝐼

(3)

Where E is the electromotive force at a certain activity aI, E0 is the standard potential at aI=1
and S is the response slope. An ideal Nernstian response slope at 25°C is 59.2 /zI.mV. [1]
In an ideal solution, the ions are randomly distributed and do not interact with each other.
However, in reality, the ions are not as randomly distributed due to electrostatic forces, which
attract ions of opposite charges and repel ions of equal charges. This means the interactions of
ions are not equal. The activity can be an estimation of the concentration of free ions. The
activity of the ion describes the deviation from ideal behavior and is therefore known as the
effective concentration:
(4)

𝑎𝐼 = 𝛾𝐼 𝑐𝐼

Where aI is the activity of the ion, cI is the concentration of the ion in the solution and γI is the
activity coefficient. The mean activity coefficient of a solution can be calculated according to
the Debye-Hückel equation:
√𝐼

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝛾± = −𝐴𝑧𝐼2 1+𝐵𝑎

(5)

0 √𝐼

Where parameters taking electrostatic and solvent interactions are A=0.509 mol-1/2dm3/2 and
B=3.286 nm-1mol-1/2dm3/2. I is the ionic strength of the solution and a0 the ion radius.[1,11]
An extended equation of the Debye-Hückel equation is used to account for the sizes of the ions
and the dielectric permittivity, which is different in the close range of an ion compared to the
average value in the solution[10]:
√𝐼

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝛾± = −𝐴𝑧𝐼2 1+𝐵𝑎

𝐾𝑗𝑒𝑙𝑙 √𝐼

+ 𝑐𝐼 𝐼

(6)

10

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

In this work, the aKjell is the Kjelland parameter[1], which is close to the Na+-ion radius with
the hydration shell, taken from reference [12]. The molar ion strength is calculated according
to equation 7:
1

𝐼 = 2 ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝑐𝑖 𝑧𝑖2

(7)

Where ci is the molar concentration of the ion and zi is its charge. All ions in the solution are
taken into account, including the background electrolyte.[13]
The benefit of potentiometric measurements with the ion-selective electrode is that the
thermodynamic and kinetic interactions are well defined. Knowing the interaction allows for
precise measurements, quick detection of irregularities in ISE behavior and fine-tuning of
membrane compositions.[6] This makes the measurements rather straightforward and
potentiometric measurements have a short response time with down to pico-molar levels of
detection limits with easy-to-use equipment. Depending on the selectivity of the membrane,
the electrodes can function even in rather complex samples such as blood. It must be taken into
consideration that the calibration is relative to the activity of the ion rather than the
concentration, which can be beneficial in cases where there is more interest in concentration of
free ions than the total concentration. In case the latter is of interest, the potentiometric
measurement is not appropriate and another method should be considered.
Additionally, not all sample types are equal, as the activity of target ions relies heavily on the
total ionic strength of the sample. Therefore ISEs have to be calibrated in a matrix that
resembles the sample.[1]
The lower detection limits of potentiometry are partially defined by the ion-exchange processes
of the ion-selective membrane. When reaching more diluted samples, the primary ions found
in the membrane of the electrode leach into the solution, creating a difference between the bulk
composition of the solution and the solution close to the membrane surface, making the
membrane insensitive to smaller concentrations of the ion.[1,6,7] This ion-exchange process is
also present when measuring interferent responses and is discussed in addition to the
transmembrane ion flux in section 1.3.4. Additionally, how to avoid their influence on the
determination of selectivity coefficients of the ISE is described in the same section.
A drawback of potentiometry is that while the measuring range is wide for ISEs, the sensitivity
is low. According to the Nernst equation (1), where the change of potential is logarithmically
dependent on the activity of the target ion, the change of one mV represents a 4% change of
11

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

ion activity of a free monovalent ion (8% for a divalent ion). However, the human body is a
tightly regulated system, where changes can be rather small e.g. for the pH of blood.[1] Other
options such as the coulometric readout method and thin-layer coulometry are explored, to
improve the monitoring of small concentration changes over time.

1.2.2 Coulometric signal transduction with solid-contact ISEs
The coulometric signal transduction is a more recent measurement method developed by
Bobacka et al.[3–5,14] It has been studied for solid-contact ion-selective electrodes. The
principle is that the electrodes are connected to a three-electrode cell system. The potential of
the working electrode is kept constant against the reference electrode (usually the open circuit
potential of the working electrode). When the concentration and with it, the activity of the
target ion is changed, then a change in potential takes place. Since the potential is kept constant,
the difference in potential occurring between the membrane and the solution must be
compensated by another part of the connected circuit, the solid contact – in this study it is the
conducting polymer PEDOT(PSS). A transient current forms, which is detected between the
working and counter electrode. This transient current changes the oxidation state and thus the
potential of the transduction layer PEDOT(PSS), reaching a new equilibrium (see Equation
8)[15,16]. The current ceases when the equilibrium has been reached.

The current is integrated over time, obtaining the charge, which is proportional to the change
of activity of the target ion in the solution (See Figure 2).

Figure 2. Scheme adapted from [4]. Description of the coulometric signal read-out method. 1) A change in
concentration of the primary ion occurs. 2) A difference in potential forms between the membrane and the sample
solution, however, the potential is kept constant between the reference and working electrode. 3) A transient
current forms, to work against the change in the potential. 4) The solid-contact is oxidizing/reducing to counteract the difference in potential. 5) Once the potential difference is compensated, the current turns to zero. When
integrating current over time, the charge value is obtained, which is dependent on the change of activity of the
primary ion.

The signal is dependent on two factors in addition to the potential change at the membranesolution interface – the bulk redox capacitance of the transduction layer and the resistance of
the ion-selective membrane. By increasing the capacitance of the conducting polymer
transduction layer, it is possible to amplify the signal. The membrane resistance is dependent
of the membrane thickness, which can limit the response time of the electrode. The biggest
advantage of the coulometric transduction method over potentiometry is its better sensitivity,
leading to the possibility to measure small changes of ion concentrations with good precision.
Previous studies have shown that the coulometric signal transduction method can detect
changes up to 0.1%. [3–5,14]

1.3 Selectivity coefficient determination
The selectivity coefficient is used to characterize the selectivity of the ion-selective membrane.
It describes the how well an electrode can separate the primary ion from interfering ions. It
gives an estimate on how much interferent present in a sample will cause noticeable error in
measurement. The selectivity coefficient is denoted as KIJ or in some cases KpotIJ when the
coefficient is determined through potentiometric measurements.
In order to determine the selectivity coefficient, several methods are available – the separate
solution method, the fixed interference method and the matched potential method.

1.3.1 Separate solution method (SSM)
The separate solution method is used to measure the different potentials that the electrode
exhibits in a pure solution of target ion and a pure solution of interfering ion. When comparing
the response of the ISE in pure target ion solution IX and interfering ion solution JX at the
same activities (ai=aj) then the difference in potential is noted (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Scheme taken from reference [1]. SSM measurement, where IX denotes target ion and JX denotes
interfering ion. The real measurement of JX starts curving off the ideal due to ion-exchange processes.

As this work uses the fixed interference method, the separate solution method is only covered
briefly, in order to introduce its working principle. The response of the ISE in pure target ion
solution can be described with Equation 9:
𝐸 = 𝐸 0 + 𝑆 × 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑎𝑖

(9)

The pure solution of the interfering ion gives the response according to the Nikolsky equation:
𝐸 = 𝐸 0 + 𝑆 × 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐾𝑖𝑗 𝑎𝑗

(10)

14

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

The selectivity coefficient can be calculated with Equation 11, when ai=aj:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐾𝐼𝐽𝑝𝑜𝑡 =

(𝐸𝐽 −𝐸𝐼 )
𝑆

(11)

Where EJ is the electromotive force, the difference between the potentials of two electrodes
immersed into the solution for the interfering ion at activity aj, EI the electromotive force for
the primary ion at activity ai and S the slope of electrode response. Due to the empirical nature
of the Nikolsky equation, this particular expression only works on monovalent ions.
Some problems appear when measuring the electromotive force, as the response of the
electrode tends to flatten off after a certain level of low activity is reached. This is caused by
an increase of primary ions within the solution. Since the membrane contains primary ions, at
a certain point in dilution, the solution will be diluted enough that the ions leach from the
membrane, causing the electrode to be unable to further distinguish changes in
concentration.[1,6] This ion-exchange process affects both the lower detection limit for the ionselective electrode as well the measurements in the pure solution of the interfering ion. When
this process occurs, the slope for the electrode response in pure target ion solution is taken for
the calculation of the selectivity coefficient.[1]
The flattening of the slope also makes the selectivity coefficient dependent on which activities
are chosen for the determination of the selectivity coefficient. When using activities closer to
the lower detection limit, the coefficient calculated will be worse than the actual value, whilst
coefficients calculated closer to the upper detection limit will be too optimistic.[1,6] The bias
is present when the electrode immersed in the interfering ion solution does not give a Nernstian
response.[6]

15

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

1.3.2 Fixed interference method (FIM)
The fixed interference method uses a mixture of the primary and interfering ion. One activity
is changed (usually the primary ion) and the other ion’s activity is kept constant. The electrode
is additionally calibrated in the pure target ion solution. Then using the slope of the pure
mixture and the point where the interfering ion’s influence starts dominating (flattening of the
curve) the equivalent potential point (EPP) is determined (see Figure 4).

Figure 4.Scheme taken from reference [1] describing the fixed interference method. IX denotes target ion, while
JX denotes interfering ion. EPP is the equivalent potential point.

The selectivity is calculated as a ratio of the activity of the equivalent potential point and the
interfering ion:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐾𝐼𝐽𝑝𝑜𝑡 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔

𝑎𝑖 (𝐷𝐿)
𝑧 ⁄𝑧
𝑎𝑗 (𝐵𝐺) 𝑖 𝑗

(12)

Where ai(DL) is the activity of the primary ion at the detection limit, aj(BG) is the activity of
the interfering ion and zi and zj are the charges of the primary and interfering ion
respectively.[6]
For the fixed interference method, the response of the electrode within the interfering ion
solution is not checked. Therefore it has been suggested to consider the measurements bias free
if the detection limits of the mixed solution and the pure target ion solution differ by more than
one magnitude.[6]

1.3.3 Matched potential method (MPM)
The matched potential method lacks a model. A known amount of target ion is added to a
starting solution. The electromotive force is registered for that change in activity (Δai). The

16

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

same thing is repeated with the interfering ion (Δaj), until the same change in electromotive
force is registered. The ratio of changes in activity defines the selectivity:
𝐾𝐼𝐽𝑀𝑃𝑀 =

𝛥𝑎𝑖
𝛥𝑎𝑗

(13)

It is a good system to use for non-Nernstian electrodes (like enzyme-type or Severinghaus-type
electrodes), but lacks predictive ability. It only has the possibility to predict electrode response
if the response is Nernstian and even then, the sample solution must be similar to the conditions
used to calculate the selectivity.[6,17]
The matched potential method selectivity coefficient can have thermodynamic meaning when
the selectivity is calculated close to the true detection limit. At that point, the interfering ion
and the primary ion are both influencing the response. If the response is Nernstian for ions of
equal charge, the selectivity coefficient might even be comparable to the ones calculated with
SSM and FIM. However, the coefficient relies heavily on the experimental conditions, so when
presenting the results, the experimental conditions should also be stated.[6]

1.3.4 Bakker’s unbiased selectivity protocol
In addition to the ion-exchange processes happening, solvent polymeric membranes also have
the tendency to transport ions from the inner solution in traditional ISE models through the
membrane into the sample. These two cause notable bias, so Bakker et al. developed a method
to negate these biases.[6,18]
It is a modification of the separate solution method, where two sets of identical electrodes are
measured. The first are measured according to the SSM protocol and an order from most
discriminated ion to least discriminated ion is determined. Next, the second set, which has not
been in contact with the primary ion, is calibrated in each solution, from most discriminated to
least discriminated. This order ensures that all the ions in the membrane are exchanged fully
with the next ion in the order, resulting in Nernstian responses for all ions (see Figure
5).[1,6,18]

17

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

Figure 5. Graphs from reference [1]. IX denotes the salt of the primary ion, JX, KX, LX are salts of different
interfering ions. The calibrations do not show a Nernstian response in (a), but the order of discrimination is visible.
Measuring them from the most discriminated ion (LX) to least discriminated (IX) in graph (b) the response become
Nernstian due to lack of bias.

The unbiased selectivity protocol requires a lot of labor, therefore many alternative solution
have been suggested to overcome the bias for interfering ions. For example, ion-complexing
agents can be used to ensure that the primary ion is bound, while the interfering ion is free to
influence the response of the electrode. In traditional models an inner solution can be
introduced into the electrode, which draws the flux of primary ions towards itself. The final
option is to keep the membrane from having contact with primary ions before the
measurements for the interfering ion.[6]

1.4 Solid-contact ISE development
A traditional transducer is an inner solution in contact with Ag/AgCl, which transduces the
ions into electrons. In order to miniaturize electrodes, the usage of liquid presents a problem.
The liquid is susceptible to extreme temperature (boiling, freezing) and evaporation needs to
be taken into account as the amount of liquid changes rapidly for miniaturized electrodes.
For miniaturization purposes, the ion-selective electrodes have been developed extensively in
order to overcome the need of using an inner solution. The first developments of a liquid-free
electrode was the coated-wire electrode. It was an electrode, which was directly covered with
a a polymeric matrix with ionophores and ionic sites spread throughout the whole matrix.[2,19]
The problem is that as with most electrodes lacking an inner solution, the potential over time
was not stable. This is most likely due to the contact between the membrane and the electrode
being blocked, creating random charges between the membrane and the electrode. In addition,

18

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

a water layer would form in between, causing unknown side reactions. A material that would
have a well-defined ion-to-electron transition was necessary.[7]
The second attempt added a hydrogel-contact to the electrode between the membrane and
electronic conductor, creating the hydro-gel electrode. It has had certain success in a variety of
fields. The contact has a straightforward mechanism similar to the liquid filling solution for
turning the chemical signal into an electrical one. However, the electrodes have limitations
concerning the uptake and release of water and the changes in volume of the hydrogel layer
depending on how much salt is in the hydrogel.[2]
Since the hydrogel-contact worked, a modified coated wire electrode was created, where a
transduction layer having redox and ion-exchange properties was placed between the electrode
and the membrane. However, it requires a high redox capacitance in order to decrease the
chance of polarization of the solid contact.[2]
This work concerns itself with solid-contact ion-selective electrodes using the conducting
polymer PEDOT(PSS) as a transduction layer, a continuation of the modified coated wire
electrode. In the following chapter its properties, performance and the materials used are
discussed.

1.5 Solid-contact ion-selective electrode materials
In order to explain the materials used in the workings of a solid-contact ion-selective electrode,
the requirements for the separate electrode sections should be discussed. As mentioned before,
the sensor consists of three parts. The electrical conductor (or electrode) is usually a metal
(platinum, gold) wire or glassy carbon rod.[2]

1.5.1 Ion-selective membrane
The selectivity of an ion-selective membrane is defined by the ionophores or ionic sites
incorporated into it. Ionophores are organic lipophilic compounds that selectively and
reversibly bind the analyte to the ion-selective membrane. The ionophore or ionic sites should
be sufficiently soluble in order to incorporate them into the polymer matrix. The ion-selective
membrane needs to be immiscible to water or have minimal swelling to confine membrane
components to the membrane phase. In order to have a rugged system and form proper films,
the ability to form a layer and mechanical strength of the membrane are also important.[7]
So far, plasticizers are added into the membrane to help dissolve the ionophore better.
However, new options are being explored as the plasticizers leach into the sample, corrupting
19

it and deteriorating the selectivity of the ion-selective electrodes. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is
one of the most used polymers for the membrane.[7]

1.5.2 Choice of sodium-selective ionophore
There is a large selection of ionophores available that exhibit sodium-selectivity. This work
covers the working of sodium-selective electrodes with the coulometric signal read-out method.
The eventual aim is to gather enough understanding to improve clinical analysis. Due to this
aim, a sodium-ionophore exhibiting strong discrimination towards K+ was needed. The sodium
ionophore IV based on 16 crown-5 ionophore has two decalino-units added to avoid the
formation of 1:2 complexes with the potassium ion.[20,21] This makes the ionophore highly
suited for the purposes of this work.

1.5.3 Solid-contact used in SC-ISEs
The solid-contact also has requirements as an ion-to-electron transducer. Multiple options are
available, based on either double-layer capacitance (carbon materials) or redox capacitance
(conducting polymers). The redox system should be fast, reversible and well-defined, to
stabilize the potential of the electrode over a longer time. A high electrical capacitance makes
the solid-contact less polarizable and reduces the formation of arbitrary charges. Due to the
possibility of a water layer forming, the solid contact should be hydrophobic in order to avoid
it.[2,7]
Currently the most used materials as solid contacts are conducting polymers (which will be
further expanded on below), carbon in various different forms and lipophilic, redox active selfassembled monolayers (SAMs).[7]

1.5.4 Conducting polymer used in SC-ISEs
A conducting polymer is a polymer, which conducts ions and/or electrons. There are multiple
ways to achieve such properties in the polymer. The polymer can be doped with ions to increase
its conductivity, such as phosphorus and aluminum [12]. Other conducting polymers are redox
polymers, polymer composites and polymer electrolytes.[2]

Figure 6. Examples of conducting polymer structures. Displayed are poly(acetylene) (PA), poly(pyrrole) (PPy),
poly(3,4-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PSS).

Conducting polymers are good solid-contacts for SC-ISE due to numerous properties. For
example, they have a good ohmic contact with carbon, gold and platinum, materials that are
commonly used for electrodes. Conductive polymers can perform ion-to-electron transduction,
which is important for transferring the ionic signal received by the receptor into electrons for
the electrode. In addition, there is a large variety of monomers that can be electrochemically
polymerized directly onto the surface of the electrode, allowing for a wide range of different
properties. Some polymers are also soluble, which means they can be deposited from solution,
making the process easier.[2]
Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as a solid-contact has been proven to be less sensitive to O2
and CO2 than polypyrrole based solid-contacts[2]. PEDOT doped with poly(styrene-sulfonate)
has been used in SC-ISEs as solid contacts in multiple studies to e.g. determine various cations
(Ag+,K+, N-methylpyridinium).[22–25] Since the process is well documented and the contact
reliable, the PEDOT(PSS) contact was used in this work.

21

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

1.5.5 Carbon and self-assembled monolayers used as solid contacts
Carbon is used in multiple different forms as a solid-contact. Most popular are carbon
nanotubes, both single and multi-walled.[5,7,26–28] Their benefit lies in the hydrophobicity
and the ability to both spray- or drop-cast them on the electrodes. Another option is three
dimensionally directed mesoporous carbon. The three dimensionally directed mesoporous
carbon has some properties similar to PEDOT (e.g. stability towards O2 and CO2) but has been
noted to have a longer lifetime due to large interfacial contact between the solid-contact and
membrane area, giving it larger double-layer capacitance. As with most carbon forms, it can
be optimized to become even more hydrophobic and more stable over time. Other forms of
carbon used also include graphene and fullerenes.[2,7]
Self-assembled monolayers have been used together with fullerene.[29] They are insensitive
to oxygen, which adds to their lifetime, however, the incubation times of these monolayers is
over 24 hours and the redox capacitance they exhibit rather low. Therefore a combination of
PEDOT and Na-PSS is used in this work, as it has been tested before and its properties are well
known.

1.6 Spin coating
Spin coating is a method for applying thin layers on the desired substrate, in this case a layer
of ion-selective membrane on the electrode. In order to compare the thin-membranes against
thicker drop-casted membrane, it was necessary to obtain thin-films with good quality. Spincoating has been tested in previous works [3,5,29], in this work it is done to establish a protocol
for future uses.
The method itself involves spinning the substrate with an applied fluid layer at a rapid rate.
The properties of the film depend on three aspects – the final speed of the spin coating, the
acceleration rate to reach the final speed and the rate at which the applied layer’s solvent
components evaporate. The final film thickness is determined by the viscosity of the layer
applied on the substrate, how quickly it dries, the percentage of solids within the layer
composition and the surface tension of the layer cocktail.
How the layer develops can be further divided into 4 stages or processes – the dispense stage,
the acceleration stage and the two different processes affecting the fluid – the substrate spinning
is constant, but depending on the conditions, either fluid thinning behavior dominates or solvent
evaporation dominates.

22

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

The film can be dispensed on the substrate in two ways. Before the spin coater is turned on, as
a static application or during a low rotation speed (around 500 rotations per minute), creating
a dynamic dispensing method. For the latter it can be said that less liquid is necessary, as the
low rotation speed helps to distribute the film better on the substrate, which is advantageous
for avoiding the forming of voids between the film and substrate and helps spread fluids that
have a poor wetting ability of the substrate. Due to its benefits, dynamic application is used in
this works protocol.
The substrate acceleration stage can be characterized by aggressive fluid expulsion. Most of
the fluid flies off in this stage, which means that final film thickness is very largely defined by
the acceleration. Spiral vortices may start forming, as in the beginning the fluid rotates at a
slower rate compared to the substrate. At the end of the acceleration stage, the fluid rotates at
the same rate as the substrate and no more changes in fluid thickness and vortices occur. The
spin speed and time selected for the acceleration stage are the main contributors to the final
film thicknesses. Usual speeds for the final speed are 1500 to 6000 rotations per minute, lasting
from 10 seconds to multiple minutes. It is best to leave it for a longer time to make sure that
whatever changes that occur during the spinning process have enough time to average out. The
average tendency is that higher spin speeds and longer spinning times generate thinner films.
In order to assure complete coverage of the electrode, the time in this work is 40 second with
the rotation of 1500 rpm.
When the fluid viscous forces dominate the thinning behavior, droplets may form depending
on the fluid characteristics. Ideally, if the fluid performs according to Newtonian viscosity and
the fluid thickness across the substrate is uniform, the end result will also be uniform, according
to mathematical models of flow behavior. In reality, however, most often a rim of thicker
coating will form, as the film gathers at the edges to be thrown off, depending on the film’s
rotation rate, surface tension and viscosity. When the film is unable to form droplets, it will not
be flung off the edge.
While both processes actually take place at the same time, at one point there’s too little liquid
left for the viscous forces to cause larger changes within the fluid flow. In that moment, the
solvent evaporation starts dominating the process. This usually happens in the later stages of
spin coating and the solvent will evaporate to a point where the viscosity of the remaining
solution will grow to the point where the film is fixed in place on the substrate. [30]

2. Experimental setup
2.1 Chemicals used
The chemicals are divided according to the section they were used in. All chemicals were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Switzerland.
The aqueous solutions prepared in this work consisted of: NaCl, KCl, (purity over 99%)
deionized water (ELGA Pure Lab Ultra, resistivity 18.2 MΩ/cm)
The chemicals used for the polymerization solution were 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT)
(purity 97%) and poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (NaPSS) (average molecular weight
70,000). The solution was prepared in deionized water.
For the ISM cocktail six chemicals were used: Sodium Ionophore IV Selectophore grade purity,
Potassium-tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (KTpCIPB) (over 98% purity), bis(1butyl-pentyl)
adipate (BBPA) (purity over 98%), tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) (purity over 99%),
poly(vinylchloride) high molecular weight (PVC) Selectophore grade purity, tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (purity over 99%).
For the preliminary spin-coat tests, the membrane cocktail used consisted of lithium
tetrafloroborate (LiTFB) (purity 98%), acetonitrile (AN) (purity 99.8%), high molecular
weight poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) Selectophore grade purity, 2-nitrphenyloctyl ether (oNPOE) (purity over 99.0%), tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDMACl) Selectophore
grade purity, tetrahydrofuran (THF) (purity over 99%).

2.2 Constructing the electrode
2.2.1 Polishing the electrodes
The PVC-encased glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were polished with 120, 240, 600, 800, 1200
and 2400 µm sandpaper, then further with 15, 9, 3 and 1 µm diamond paste and finished with
0.3 µm Al2O3 paste. Finally the electrodes were cleaned ultrasonically for 10 minutes in ethanol
and 10 minutes in deionized water. Then the cleanliness of the electrodes were checked with
cyclic voltammetry. A three-electrode cell is set up and filled with 0.1 M NaCl. The working
electrode was connected along with a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl/ 3 M KCl, Metrohm) and
a counter electrode (glassy carbon rod) to the Autolab General Purpose Electrochemical
System PGSTAT20. Three scans were recorded in the potential range of -0.5 to 0.5 V with a
scan rate of 0.1 V/s after the solution had been purged with N2 for 15 minute. The electrodes
are considered clean if there are no peaks evident in the cyclic voltammetry scans. A constant
24

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

stream of N2 was directed above the surface of the solution for the whole duration of the
measurement.

2.2.2 Application of the PEDOT(PSS) layer as a solid-contact
The polymerization solution was weighed into a 25 ml flask and the flask was filled 3/4ths with
deionized water. The polymerization solution consisted of 0.01 M of EDOT and 0.1 M NaPSS.
A magnetic stirrer was added into the flask and the flask was set up to stir for overnight covered
with foil to ensure the complete dissolution of the monomer. The next day the flask was filled
up to the mark with water.
The PEDOT(PSS) layer was applied via electropolymerization. The working electrode was
connected to a three-electrode cell system to the Autolab General Purpose Electrochemical
System PGSTAT20, with a commercial Metrohm Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl reference electrode and
a glassy carbon rod as the counter electrode. A current of 0.0014 mA was sent through the
polymerization solution for 71 seconds (1 mC transduction layer), 142 seconds (2 mC
transduction layer) or 285 seconds (4 mC transduction layer). The longer the polymerization is
carried out, the more polymer is formed and the thicker (higher loading) the transduction layer
becomes. The electrode was rinsed with deionized water after electroplymerization, dried and
then conditioned in 0.01 M NaCl overnight.

2.2.3 Application of the ion-selective membrane
The membrane cocktail was prepared by weighing all the components and then mixing them
together in a bottle. The bottle was left to mix overnight on a rotating platform. The membrane
components used in this work are displayed in Table 1.

Once the transduction layer was conditioned and the electrodes had dried for a few hours, the
desired amount of membrane cocktail was applied on the electrode and the spin-coater was
then activated. The spinning was set to 500 rpm for 6 seconds and 1500 rpm for 40 seconds
according to the optimized protocol (Section 3.1). Then the electrodes were covered to avoid
the contamination of the membrane and were left to dry for 2 days. After the membrane had
dried, the electrodes were submerged in a 0.01 M NaCl conditioning solution.

2.3 Potentiometric measurements
The potentiometric measurements consist of the calibration of the electrodes over a wide
activity range (several orders of magnitude) and dilution-addition experiments (changing of
5% of the sample concentration back and forth). The experiments are done with the 16-channel
millivoltmeter (Lawson Labs. Inc., Malvern, PE, USA) and an automatic dilution system
Metrohm Dosino 800 instrument (Herisau, Switzerland).
The electrochemical cell is filled with 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. A commercial Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl
electrode is used as a reference electrode. The electrodes are connected to the system and the
measurement is started. The automatic dilution is programmed to remove 34.2 ml of solution
every 5 minutes and to replace it with the equal amount of deionized water. The solution is
diluted by a half-decade at each step. The 5 minutes in between are to measure the potential
and allow the system to attain an equilibrium. The experiment is continued until the potential
stabilizes at a certain value as the target ions present in the membrane start leaching into the
solution due to the low concentration of target ions in the solution, keeping the potential at the
solution-membrane interface constant. The calibration is also done with 0.1 M KCl added into
the cell and diluting solution as background electrolyte.
The addition-dilution experiments are performed manually. A magnetic stirrer is added into the
cell. The cell is filled with 1 mM NaCl. At first, 25 µl of 0.1 M NaCl is added, changing the
concentration to 1.05 mM. Then 2.5 ml of deionized water is added, changing the concentration
back to 1 mM. The same thing is repeated, adding 26.5 µl and 2.60 ml deionized water to
account for the change in solution volume. After each step, a 5-minute waiting time is allowed
for stabilization of the potential.

2.4 Coulometric measurements
The experiments conducted with the coulometric transduction method are similar to the
potentiometric experiments, containing calibration and dilution-addition experiments. The
26

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

experiments are done with the IviumCompact Stat instrument (Ivium Technologies, The
Netherlands) and the automatic dilution system Metrohm Dosino 800 (Herisau, Switzerland).
The cell in which the electrodes are connected to is placed in a Faraday cage to avoid external
disturbances to the measurement.
The calibration is set up in a wide shallow bowl, to ensure that the electrodes stay submerged
in solution while the dilution system removes the solution. 50 ml of 0.1 M NaCl is measured
into the cell. A commercial Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl electrode is used as a reference electrode. First
the electrode and reference electrode are connected to measure the open-circuit potential for
10 minutes. The counter electrode is connected and then the open-circuit potential is applied
and the measurement and dilution are started. During dilution 34.2 ml is removed from the
solution and is replaced with deionized water. The solution is diluted by a half-decade at each
step. After each dilution, due to the applied potential, a transient current passes the system. The
SC starts accumulating a charge changing its oxidation state because of the charge to achieve
a new equilibrium. With each dilution, more charge is gathered until the current becomes too
small compared to the membranes resistance and the staircase shape of the charge graph is lost.
The addition-dilution experiment is done in 50 ml of 1 mM NaCl solution. The concentration
is changed back and forth by adding 25 µl 0.1 M NaCl, 2.50 ml deionized water, 26.5 µl 0.1
M NaCl and 2.60 ml of deionized water. This causes a change of 5%, going from 1 mM to 1.05
mM and back. A 5-minute waiting time is left between each addition-dilution step to allow the
stabilization of the potential.

2.5 Spin-coating protocol optimization
The spin coater used is a KW-4A (Chemat tech. inc., Los Angeles, USA).
In order to determine an optimal way to coat the electrodes with the ion-selective membrane,
preliminary tests were conducted. Chloride-selective membrane cocktails were used for these
tests, and afterwards the electrodes were wiped with tetrahydrofuran to wipe off the cocktail
before it dried. The electrodes were then used again for the next set of spin-coating
experiments.
Tested spin speeds were 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 rpm, with different cocktail
amounts of 15, 50, 100 µl. The spin-coater was turned on and the cocktail was dropped on the
surface with an automatic pipette. Most successful ones (1500 rpm with 50 and 100 µl and 750
with 100 µl) were tested again, to make sure the result is repeatable (at least twice). The
27

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

application of the ISM-cocktail before starting the spin-coater was tested next with the three
protocols.
In order to improve the distribution of the ISM-cocktail, a 12 second pre-rotation step at 500
rpm was introduced. These tests were done with an additionally prepared cocktail, which
consisted of the plasticizers of the sodium-selective membrane to test the protocol with a
membrane cocktail more similar in viscosity to the cocktail used in the real experiments. The
three best methods were selected and the mass of the electrodes was checked with a Mettler
Toledo XS205 DualRange Max 81g/220 g, d = 0.01 mg/0.1 mg scale before and after
application of the ion-selective membrane (after the membrane had dried for 2 days).A total of
9 electrodes were prepared – three with 750 rpm and 50 µl, three with 1500 rpm and 50 µl of
cocktail and three with 1500 rpm and 100 µl of cocktail. Based on the variation of the weights
within one set, 1500 rpm with 50 µl was decided to be the method to continue with. As
recommended in reference [30], using a pre-rotation step for distributing the membrane on the
electrode surface was added.
The final optimized protocol used in this study was dropping the membrane cocktail onto the
electrode surface, starting the spin-coater at 500 rpm for 6 seconds and then accelerating to
1500 rpm for 40 seconds.

2.6 Determining the selectivity coefficients
The selectivity is measured with the Fixed Interference method. The potentiometric
calibrations described in section 3.2 were also used to calculate the selectivity coefficients. The
following calibration procedures were done applied: first time the electrodes were measured in
with background electrolyte (0.1 M KCl) and second time without any background electrolyte,
only the primary ion salt. Then the results of the activities of the target ion vs the potential are
plotted on the same graph, where the equivalent potential point is found. Thereafter the
selectivity coefficients are calculated according to the equation 12 in section 1.3.2. The
selectivity coefficients were determined for the thin-membrane and thick-membrane Na+SCISEs.

3. Results and discussion
Altogether three sets of electrodes with different membrane thickness and therefore, resistance
were prepared and tested. The first set had 45 μl of ion-selective membrane cocktail applied
via spin-coating (hence forth called thin-membrane electrode). The second set had 100 μl of
ion-selective membrane cocktail applied via spin-coating (from now on called mediummembrane electrodes). The third set had 50 μl of ISM drop casted on the electrodes (thickmembrane electrodes for short). All three sets were weighed after polymerization of the
transduction layer and after the drying of the applied ISM to obtain the mass of the ISM. A
very rough estimate of membrane thickness was calculated. The densities of the PVC and
BBPA were averaged with factors of 0.35 and 0.65 respectively according to the weight
fraction in the membrane. The experimentally obtained mass was divided with the density to
obtain a volume. The volume was divided with the area of the electrode. The results are
presented in Table 2.

The difference of the membrane weights from highest to lowest mass are as follows: thin
membrane 0.87 mg, medium membrane 0.98 mg and the thick membrane 2.3 mg. This is in

29

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

agreement with the observations in literature [30], that spin-coating gives more uniform results
compared to other methods.

3.1 Spin-coating optimization protocol
The first preliminary tests consisted of applying a Cl--selective membrane to the electrodes via
different spin-coating rotation speeds and rotations and judging how well the membrane
covered the electrode surface (done with rotations 500-2500 rpm). Photos were taken during
the process and some examples can be seen in the Appendix A. Three protocols were tested
for whether the electrode surface coverage would remain similar after repeating the test at least
twice. As the protocols were visually confirmed to work appropriately, the selected protocols
were used for more extensive testing and are described in the paragraph below.
These protocols were: applying 100 µl of ISM cocktail and rotating the spin coater at speeds
750 and 1500 rpm, and applying 50 µl of ISM cocktail and rotating the spin coater at 1500
rpm. Three replicates of each protocol were made, weighing the electrodes before and after
application of the Cl--selective membrane to obtain its mass. Adequate time for evaporation of
the membrane solvent was given in order to have the correct weight for the ISM. The weight
results can be seen in Table 3.
Table 3. Masses obtained for electrodes with different spin-coating protocols

30

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

After determining the masses for the preliminary tests and consulting data in reference [30], a
pre-rotation step at 500 rpm was introduced at 12 seconds, which allows to distribute the Na+cocktail better before the acceleration stage (for maximum speeds of 1000 and 1500 rpm). As
the final ISM thickness is determined by the maximum speed, it was determined that a 6 second
pre-rotation step was sufficient to distribute the ISM-cocktail. The final protocol was chosen
to consist of a pre-rotation step at 500 rpm for 6 seconds and the final speed at 1500 rpm for
40 seconds. The established protocol was used to prepare electrodes with two different
membrane thicknesses in this work.

3.2 Potentiometric experiments
3.2.1 Calibration
The potentiometric experiments involved calibrating the Na+-SCISEs and the plotting the
results against the logarithmic activities. The slope is calculated and deemed near-Nernstian
and fit for measuring the coulometric transduction response when the slope differed from the
Nernstian response less than 7 mV. This definition is less strict compared to usually reported
near-Nernstian values [1], because the electrodes are serving as proof-of-concept for the
coulometric signal transduction method.
The activities were calculated according to the equation aI = γIcI where the activity coefficient
γI was calculated according to the extended Debye-Hückel (Equation 5).
The values for potential to plot with the activity were the average of the last five readings of
the potential at the end of the 5-minute stabilization time before the start of the dilution. This
was to ensure that the membrane-solution interface has truly reached the equilibrium.
When conducting potentiometric experiments, the KCl that was originally used as a
background electrolyte turned out to be a severe interferent. Once the interferent was removed

31

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

and dilutions were done with pure water, the thin-membrane electrodes gave a typical
calibration curve for SCISEs as shown in Figure 7.

In conclusion, it can be said that the thin-membrane and medium-membrane electrodes
performed comparably within potentiometric calibration, but the thick-membrane electrodes
gave slopes closer to the Nernstian values The primary ion diffuses into the membrane,
affecting the membrane composition significantly, which might influence the electrode
response. Another possible reason is that the thin-membrane electrodes have significantly
smaller bulk fractions, meaning that some interactions influence the electrode response at a
larger scale compared to electrodes with larger bulk fractions.

3.2.2 Addition-dilution experiments
Addition-dilution experiments were performed with all three sets of the Na+-SCISEs. The
sample solution was 1 mM NaCl, where Na+-SCISEs reached equilibrium within 5 minutes.
The concentration was then raised to 1.05 mM and again left to equilibrate before returning it
back to 1 mM. This dilution and addition was repeated once again.
Graphs summarizing the results obtained are presented in Figure 12. Overall, it is difficult to
distinguish the induced differences of concentration as even the magnetic stirrer affected the
results (small dents in Figure 12).

medium-membrane electrodes (b) and the thick-membrane electrodes (c) GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM. Td
signifies transduction layer, to separate different electrodes from each other.

Looking at the thin- and medium-membrane electrodes, the standard potentials that the
electrodes exhibit do not separate according to the loadings of the solid-contacts (1 mC, 2 mC,
4 mC PEDOT(PSS)). This means that the transduction layer does not affect the response of the
electrode in the potentiometric addition-dilution experiment. As shown in Figure 12c for the
thick-membrane electrode, the distinction of the different loadings of PEDOT(PSS) is clearer.
The 4 mC transduction layer have significantly higher standard potentials (around 110 mV and
175 mV) than the 1 mC transduction layer ones exhibiting lower standard potentials (close to
0 mV). Drift-wise the thick-membrane electrodes have the least drift and a few of the mediummembrane electrodes have a slightly noticeable drift.3.3 Coulometric experiments

3.3.1 Calibration
The coulometric calibration was evaluated upon its ability to form a curve of cumulated charge
when diluting the sample, which would indicate the completion of the redox reaction of the
conducing polymer SC PEDOT(PSS) to full equilibrium. The time between two dilutions was
5 minutes. If the staircase shape formed, that means the electrode was able to return to the
equilibrium within those five minutes. If no staircase formed, it meant that the membrane was
too resistive and the electrode did not reach equilibrium within the allotted time. The more the
concentration is changed from the point where the potential was fixed, the more charge
accumulates to compensate for the difference in potential that is caused by the dilution. So the
lower the activity, the higher the charge in this experiment.

coulometric signal transduction method for electrodes with 1 mC loading of PEDOT(PSS) (a) and 4 mC loading
of PEDOT(PSS) (b). The calibrations start at 0.1 M NaCl, diluting a half-decade every 5 minutes. The dotted line
signifies the 0 current point, indicating that with continued dilutions some electrodes like in graph (b) develop a
noticeable background charge.

The thin-membrane electrodes performed well in the coulometric signal read-out mode,
maintaining a sharp staircase shape down to the concentration 10-5 M NaCl resulting from the
redox reaction of the PEDOT(PSS) solid contact. This indicates a fast response to the change
in potential at the ISM-solution interface and the equilibrium is reached fast, which makes it
easy to see when a concentration change occurs. When plotting the activity of the target ion
against the charge, the values for the charges taken were an average from 5 last readings of the
equilibration, before another dilution was made. The aim of using these data points is to use
values representing the equilibrated state or a state close to equilibrium, where the current has
returned close to zero. The response of Na+-SCISEs with a thin-membrane separate
proportionally according to the transduction layer (see Figure 14).

range from 0.1 M NaCl to 10-5.5 M NaCl. Dashed lines represent theoretical values based on multiplied averages
calculated from the electrode responses that had a 1 mC PEDOT(PSS) loading.

The results for individual measurements are presented in Table 4. To enable theoretical
comparison of SCISEs with different loadings of PEDOT(PSS), the slope and standard
potential values for 1 mC loading PEDOT(PSS) electrodes were averaged and multiplied by 2
and 4 and used as a theoretical comparison in Figure 14. The average of 1 mC electrodes lines
up with the actual electrodes, as the replicas exhibited almost identical slope and intercept
values. The multiplication of 2x1 mC and 4x1 mC loading PEDOT(PSS) have slightly steeper
slopes than the actual measured electrode values (see dashed lines in Figure 14). This indicates
that out of the 3 different loadings used, 1 mC loading of PEDOT(PSS) used in Na+-SCISEs
gets used to a fuller capacitance compared to the other two loadings.

The medium-membrane electrodes performed in a similar fashion, with the staircase shape
observed until 10-4 M NaCl.

The calibrations start at 0.1 M NaCl, diluting a half-decade every 5 minutes. The dotted line signifies the 0 current

Again, when plotting the target ion activity against the charge, the Na+-SCISEs with medium
membrane separate according to transduction layer (see Figure 16).

The results of each electrode are presented in more detail in Table 5. The averaging of the
results for 1 mC loading electrodes was done for medium-membrane electrodes as well (see
dashed lines in Figure 16). The results were similar to the thin-layer electrode ones – the
multiplication of 1 mC PEDOT(PSS) averaged slope and intercept showed a steeper line than
the experimental results, indicating the redox capacitance of electrodes with a loading of 2 mC
or 4 mC PEDOT(PSS) is not used fully. However, since the proportions are in place it is safe
to assume that the electrodes are in broad terms showing the expected behavior.

The thick-membrane Na+-SCISE had a very slow response time compared to the other Na+SCISEs, presumably due to the membrane thickness, which means the resistance of the
membrane is also higher. In Figure 16, it can be seen that even after a 5 minute waiting time,
the equilibrium has not been reached, as is evident by the lack of a staircase like shape of the
graphs and the current not returning to zero.

Figure 17. Coulometric calibration of thick-membrane electrodes GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM. Started at 0.1 M
NaCl, diluting a half-decade every 5 minutes. The dotted line signifies the 0 current point, to which neither (a) or
(b) return, indicating the equilibrium has not been reached by the time the next dilution starts.

When plotting the activity and charge, the picture is quite similar to the corresponding figures
for the thin and medium membrane SC-ISEs. The slopes for the equations are lower compared
to thin-membrane and medium-membrane Na+-SCISE, due to the incomplete equilibration,
therefore the results are not directly comparable.

3.3.2 Addition-dilution experiments
The addition-dilution experiments were evaluated according to two criteria - whether there was
any drift and whether response time was fast enough that a clear staircase shape would form.
The thin- and medium-membrane electrodes were working as expected, excluding occasional
drift (see Figure 19). The staircase shape formed clearly, but could be affected by drift.

Figure 19. Addition-dilution experiments for a thin-membrane electrode (a) and a medium-membrane electrode
(b), both being GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM. Both electrodes started off in a 1 mM solution, then the concentration
was increased to 1.05 mM, then lowered back to 1 mM. The sequence was repeated once.

41

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

The summary of the thin- and medium-membrane experiments can be seen in Figure 20.

Figure 20. Summary of all coulometric addition-dilution experiments for electrodes GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM
with thin (a) and medium membrane (b).Starting solution was 1 mM, which was increased to 1.05 mM, then
brought back to 1 mM. The process was repeated once. The electrode responses in graph (a) thin-membrane
electrodes do not drift as much as compared to graph (b) with the medium-membrane electrodes. Dotted line
indicates 0 charge to be able to assess drift.

As is seen in the graphs, the thin-membrane Na+-SCISEs experienced less drift than the
medium-membrane ones, which can be explained with the processes happening faster through
the thinner membranes as the membrane thickness is proportional to the membrane resistance.
The membrane resistance might also be the cause of the charges not accumulating fully
proportionally in the case of medium-membrane electrodes, as they do not separate as neatly
according to transduction layer as the thin-membrane electrodes do (see 1 mC PEDOT(PSS)
Na+-SCISEs in Figure 20 (b)). However, it is possible to detect small changes (5%
concentration change) with the thin-membrane electrodes, if the transduction layer
PEDOT(PSS) loading is chosen to be 1 or 2 mC, as the Na+-SCISEs with a 4 mC loading show
larger drift.

42

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

Thick-membrane addition-dilution experiments did not give consistent results (see Figure 21).
There was a lot of drift and the staircase-shape graph did not form at all when integrating the
current over time. The equilibrium was not achieved after a five-minute wait time. The thinand medium-membrane Na+-SCISE typically achieved equilibrium during a 2 -3 minute wait
time.

Figure 21. Addition-dilution experiment for the thick-membrane electrode GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM.
Measurements for the same electrode done three days apart. Starting solution was 1 mM NaCl, which
concentration was raised to 1.05 mM, then diluted again 1 mM and the process was repeated once.

3.4 Life-time of the electrodes
The near-Nernstian behavior of the electrodes was maintained throughout the experiments of
this work and was controlled by potentiometric calibration over two to three weeks. The thinmembrane electrodes were measured over a time period of 22 days after the conditioning of
the ISM, and the readings were still stable and followed a near-Nernstian slope (see Table 7).
Each point for the potential in the plots was determined by averaging the 5 last readings of the
potentiometer prior to the subsequent dilution step.

The medium- and thick-membrane electrodes were measured over a time period of 13 days

slope (see Table 8).

3.5 Selectivity coefficients
The selectivity of Na+-SCISEs was determined for thin- and thick-membrane electrodes. The
thin-membrane Na+-SCISEs’ results for the equivalent potential point varied significantly even
between the replicas (see Figure 22). Both electrodes have been made the same way, but the
equivalent potential point is at different ion activities for electrode (a) and (b). According to
theory the ISE behavior for mixed solutions is for the plot to follow the Nernstian slope until
the interfering ion determines the ISE potential, at which point the potential stays constant. The
thin-membrane electrodes, however, show a rise in potential. Therefore, the lowest value
before the rise in potential was chosen to be the EPP.

The selectivity coefficients measured for K+ ion are an order of magnitude larger than regular
selectivity coefficients for these type of electrodes[20], presumably due to the thinner
membrane layer. The thick-membrane Na+-SCISEs performed similarly and their results are

The selectivity coefficient for the thick-membrane electrodes are smaller than the thinmembrane Na+-SCISEs, meaning the thicker-membrane is more selective, as shown by the
calibration plots, which behave as expected (Figure 23).

Figure 23. Potentiometric calibration of thick-membrane electrodes GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM with (red) and
without background electrolyte (black). Concentrations ranged from 0.1 M NaCl to 10-5.5 M NaCl. Background
electrolyte is 0.1 M KCl, which stays constant throughout the dilution. Td signifies transduction layer.

3.6 Comparison of different membrane thicknesses
There are also certain differences between electrodes that have similar loadings for the
transduction layers but different ion-selective membrane thicknesses. The most important
difference is the time needed for reaching the equilibrium during coulometric experiments. As
mentioned before, thin-membrane and medium-membrane electrodes are more suitable for
coulometric measurements. Thick-membrane electrodes, however, are more suitable for
potentiometric measurements.
When looking at the coulometric signal read-out method calibration plots related to activity
(Figure 24), the thick-membrane electrodes do not behave consistently with respect to SCISEs
with the two other thicknesses. However, the medium-membrane electrodes have a steeper
47

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

slope compared to the thin-membrane ones (Figure 24). This is mere speculation, but it could
possibly be the difference of resistance of thin- and medium-membranes, where the thinmembrane electrode resistance is low enough to allow side reactions to occur with oxygen, as
the solutions were not de-aerated. Another possible explanation is that the thin-membrane does
not necessarily cover the electrode fully, causing the solution to be in direct contact with the
PEDOT(PSS) layer, although, no pinholes visible to the bare eye were noticed. The slope for
the potentiometric calibrations is also representative of how the ion-selective membrane
performs, however, when comparing the slopes of electrodes according to the thickness of
membrane, no clear pattern emerges other than the response closer to the Nernstian behavior
from the thick-membrane electrodes.

Figure 24. Comparison of coulometric calibrations of electrodes GC/PEDOT(PSS)/Na+-ISM with the loading of
the PEDOT(PSS) and the thickness of the ISM varying. All graphs start the calibration at 0.1 M NaCl and have a
point for every half-decade. Graph (a) covers electrodes with 1 mC PEDOT(PSS) loading, (b) 2 mC PEDOT(PSS)
loading and (c) 4 mC PEDOT(PSS) loading.

The selectivity coefficients show that the thin-membrane electrodes are less selective compared
to thick-membrane electrodes. This is an important aspect to consider for future developments,
if one wants to measure small concentration changes with the coulometric signal transduction
method within a complex sample.

3.7 Performance of Na+ SC-ISEs in coulometric and potentiometric signal
transduction
Both potentiometric and coulometric signal transduction have their benefits. The drop-casted
electrode (i.e. thick-membrane electrode) proved to be more suitable for potentiometry, whilst
the thin-membrane and medium-membrane electrodes performed better than the thick ones in
coulometric measurements. The thick-membrane electrodes were too resistive to properly
reach the equilibrium in the coulometric read-out measurements within the given timeframe.
48

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

A benefit of the coulometric transduction is the possibility to amplify the signal. The charge
increases proportionally according to the loading of the transduction layer. However, not all
electrodes display well-defined proportionality, as the redox capacitance of the PEDOT(PSS)
layer does not get fully used when the ISM is too resistive (e.g. medium-membrane and thickmembrane Na+-SCISEs in this work).

Amplification of the signal is beneficial for

measurements of small concentration changes (e.g. Na+ concentration changes within blood).
However, the thickness of the ISM also plays an important role in the measurement. In the
cases of drop-casted membrane in coulometric measurements the ion-selective membrane
tends to be very resistive requiring a significantly longer response time compared to thin- and
medium-membrane electrodes. Therefore potentiometry is still an important diagnostic tool for
the performances of solid-contact electrodes.

49

4. Conclusion
To summarize this work, the master thesis covers the preparation and characterization of Na+selective solid-contact ion-selective electrodes. Three sets of electrodes were made with three
different membrane thicknesses with resistance being proportional to the membrane thickness.
The sets were further subdivided into sets of two according to the solid-contact loading (1 mC,
2 mC and 4 mC PEDOT(PSS)). The three membrane thicknesses were achieved by a spincoating protocol (thin and medium) and drop-casting (thick). The spin-coating protocol was
developed within this thesis. The third set had drop-casted membranes to test the performance
of spin-coated membranes against drop-casted ones.
The Na+-SCISEs were characterized with the potentiometric signal transduction method and
the coulometric signal read-out method. The electrodes were calibrated in order to determine
the working and linear range. Addition-dilution experiments were performed to compare the
sensitivity of potentiometric signal transduction and coulometric signal read-out method. The
potentiometric signal transduction method has a wider linear range than the coulometric signal
read-out method, except for thin-membrane electrodes, where both methods had a comparable
linear range. As the time between dilutions was fixed, the range for medium- and thickmembrane Na+-SCISEs could have been affected by the dilution process and they might have
not reached equilibrium within the 5-minute waiting time. The coulometric signal read-out
method has better sensitivity. The better sensitivity is granted by the inherent ability of the
method to amplify the signal depending on the membrane resistivity and redox capacitance of
the transduction layer PEDOT(PSS). There is also significant noise reduction due to using the
charge instead of current, which is important for sensors in use.
The electrode performance is influenced by the membrane thickness and the loading of the
transduction layers. The thin-membrane and medium-membrane electrodes (both spin-coated)
gave better staircase shape responses with the coulometric signal read-out method and
acceptable response slopes and working range with the potentiometric signal transduction
method. The thin-membrane and medium-membrane electrodes show different behavior
according to response in the coulometric signal read-out method, with the medium-membrane
electrodes having steeper slopes. It is possible that thin-membrane electrodes have a much
lower resistance, causing side-reactions to occur, which suppress the slope. The drop-casted
membranes or thick membranes had better response slopes and a wider working range in the
potentiometric signal transduction method. For the coulometric signal read-out method, the
50

Helmi Ulrika Kirm

thick-membrane electrodes did not reach equilibrium within the given 5-minute stabilization
time. Therefore, no staircase shape was formed, making a direct comparison impossible with
the other membrane thicknesses in the coulometric read-out mode.
The comparison of results with different transduction layer loadings (1 mC, 2 mC, 4 mC
PEDOT(PSS)) obtained using the potentiometric signal transduction method does not reveal
well-defined trends in signal response. For the coulometric signal transduction method the
situation is much better. The current study shows that the responses proportional to the
electrode loading with PEDOT(PSS) are observed. Hence, such loading of the solid contacts
(SC) provides coulometric signals proportional to the charge, which in turn has practical
importance in field of sensors. However, as the membrane gets more resistive (medium- and
thick-membranes), the redox capacitance of the SC cannot be fully exploited and the charge
response becomes smaller than anticipated. This observation limits the signal amplification of
the contacts developed when used in coulometric signal transduction mode.
The life-time of the electrodes was found to be at least 15 days with all electrodes giving nearNernstian response slopes in the potentiometric signal transduction. The selectivity coefficients
of thin- and thick-membranes were determined. For the thin-membrane electrodes, K+ was
determined to be a severe interferent, with the selectivity coefficients being by an order of
magnitude lower than the previously reported values. This can be partially explained by
membrane thinness, as the bulk fraction of the thin-membranes are significantly smaller and
the surface region significantly larger compared to the other membrane thicknesses, possibly
causing unknown side-reactions. The thick-membrane Na+-SCISE selectivity coefficients were
in accordance with previously reported values.
Future developments in this area could investigate how the interfering ions influence the
coulometric signal read-out method measurements.

Figure A-4. Spin-coating of 3 drops of Na+-cocktail without ionophore. Protocol for photo (a) is 500 rpm for
cocktail distribution for 12 seconds, with the cocktail being applied during the rotation, going to 1000 rpm for 20
seconds for ISM-layer formation. Photo (b) shows the result of 500 rpm pre-spinning for 12 seconds for cocktail
distribution, with the cocktail being applied during the rotation, and 1500 rpm for 20 seconds for ISM-layer
formation. Protocol for photo (c) is the application of the drops before the start of spin-coating, then cocktail
distribution at 500 rpm for 12 seconds and then ISM layer formation at 1500 rpm for 20 seconds.

Appendix C
Appendix C contains electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) conducted on the thinmembrane Na+-SCISE. The WE was connected to a commercial three electrode cell system
and to the Autolab Frequency Response Analyzer System (AUT20.FRA2-Autolab, Eco
Chemie, B.V. The Netherlands). The RE was a commercial Metrohm electrode Ag/AgCl/ 3 M
KCl and the counter electrode was a glassy carbon rod. The electrodes were immersed in a 0.1
M NaCl solution. The frequency ranged from 500 kHz to 100 mHz with a sinusoidal excitation
signal with the amplitude of 10 mV. The potential applied to the electrode was the open circuit
potential of the electrode within the experiment.
Due to the COVID-19 emergency situation, further experiments on medium- and thickmembrane electrodes could not be conducted.
