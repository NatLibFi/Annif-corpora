Supervisor: Elina Pirjatanniemi
Abstract:

Supervisor:

Members of terrorist organisations may be excluded from refugee protection due to their
participation in acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN (exclusion ground (c)).
However, the court practice of EU Member States is divergent in relation to the application the
said exclusion ground. Recently, the emerging trend has been to apply the provisions of EU
counter terrorism law as guiding the interpretation of the exclusion ground (c). This research
responds to the need to clarify to what extent the provisions of EU counter terrorism law may be
used for the interpretation of the exclusion ground (c), and the limits such interpretation.
Firstly, the terrorist nature and the acts and activity of terrorist groups are discussed. The
establishment of the terrorist nature of an organisation in the exclusion context is affected by the
UN and EU lists of terrorist groups. Additionally, different terrorism related acts and activities
are listed in the EU Terrorism Directive. These actions may be considered as acts contrary to the
purposes and principles of the UN in the meaning of the UNSC resolutions. However, that does
not necessarily mean that such actions also conform to the acts regulated in the context of the
exclusion ground (c). The application of the exclusion ground (c) requires that an action fulfils a
certain gravity threshold. The threshold may be crossed at least then when the action contains
indiscriminate violence or violence against civilians, or then when the action has serious
implications on international peace and security. Not all terrorism related actions criminalised in
the Terrorism Directive conform to these gravity requirements.
Secondly, the serious reasons to consider standard requires that the member of a terrorist
organisation was individually responsible for the actions of the organisation so that exclusion
may become applicable. International criminal law contains different forms of individual criminal
responsibility of which incitement; and aiding and abetting are also regulated in the Terrorism
Directive. Some other forms of individual criminal responsibility have been regulated as
independent criminal facts in the Terrorism Directive. Additionally, individual responsibility in
the Terrorism Directive may exceed even further to the preparative phase than in international
criminal law. The individual responsibility emanating from the articles of the Terrorism Directive
may correspond to individual responsibility required in the application of the exclusion ground
(c). However, the participation of a member of a terrorist group must also fulfil a gravity threshold
of substantial participation. The threshold is crossed at least in case leaders of such groups.

Introduction

Refugees, Security, Terrorism, and Exclusion

Picture a person who supports the armed guerrilla warfare of a terrorist organisation in
the mountains of a foreign country. They are arrested, tortured, and sentenced to life
imprisonment.1 Another person joins a terrorist group to become a fighter and one of its
senior officials. After leaving the organisation because of political differences with its
leadership, they come under threat.2 Both individuals successfully flee from their difficult
situations and arrive in the European Union (hereafter, EU). Imagine yet another person
who has been residing illegally in different EU member states for many years, and at the
same time has acted as a leading member of a terrorist group.3 All three individuals apply
for asylum in different EU member states and claim that they would be persecuted if they
were returned to their countries of origin. What kind of effect should their acts as
members of terrorist organisations have on the processing of their asylum applications?
All EU member states are parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status
of Refugees (hereafter, the Refugee Convention) and its 1967 Protocol (hereafter, the
Protocol).4 The right to asylum is guaranteed in Article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the EU, and protection from refoulement is guaranteed in Article 19. The
principle of non-refoulement requires that “[n]o one may be removed, expelled or
extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the
death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”5 In
addition, the Refugee Convention requires that states’ parties do not remove refugees to
countries in which they are at risk of persecution.6 Naturally, the principle of nonrefoulement also involves asylum seekers whose asylum applications have not yet been
processed. 7

The recast Asylum Qualification Directive (hereafter, the QD) determines the concept of
a refugee and the rights it entails in more detail.8 The QD sets common criteria for
recognising applicants for asylum within the meaning of Article 1 of the Refugee
Convention.9 The concept of a “refugee” is defined in Article 2(d) of the QD as:
…a third-country national who, owing to a well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or
membership of a particular social group, is outside the country of nationality
and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself
of the protection of that country, or a stateless person, who, being outside
of the country of former habitual residence for the same reasons as
mentioned above, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it,
and to whom Article 12 does not apply.
Therefore, a refugee is a person to whom, according to Article 12, exclusion does not
apply. Exclusion is thus an exception or a limitation upon the granting of refugee status
and the guarantees it brings with it to a person otherwise fulfilling the definition of a
refugee. Article 12(1) considers exclusion of persons who are eligible for appropriate
protection from other sources such as different United Nations (hereafter, UN)
organisations or agencies, or other states. Article 12(2), which is based on Article 1 F of
the Refugee Convention, consists of the exclusion clause that is relevant for the topic of
this thesis.10 According to Article 12(2)(a–c) of the QD,
A third-country national or a stateless person is excluded from being a
refugee where there are serious reasons for considering that:
(a) he or she has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime
against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to
make provision in respect of such crimes;
(b) he or she has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country
of refuge prior to his or her admission as a refugee, which means the time

Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, 13 December 2011, Recast, OJ
20.12.2011, L 337/9. Hereafter, QD. In addition, the QD contains a separate system of subsidiary protection
as a complementary and additional protection type of the EU asylum law. Subsidiary protection is regulated
in Articles 1 and 2 of the QD, and it covers situations in which an individual does not qualify as a refugee,
but substantial grounds have been shown that they would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if
returned to their country of origin.

Exclusion from subsidiary protection is regulated in Article 17 of the QD. The provision slightly differs
from the exclusion clause regulated in Article 12(2–3). For instance, it has an additional exclusion ground:
According to the exclusion ground (d), an individual is excluded from being eligible for subsidiary
protection in case they constitute a danger to the community or to the security of the member state in which
they are present. However, the CJEU has regarded in its case Shajin Ahmed that, in principle, the
interpretation of exclusion grounds (a–c) should correspond to their counterparts in the article regulating
exclusion from refugee status. See CJEU, Case C-369/17 Shajin Ahmed, 13 September 2018, paras. 42–46.

of issuing a residence permit based on the granting of refugee status;
particularly cruel actions, even if committed with an allegedly political
objective, may be classified as serious non-political crimes;
(c) he or she has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles
of the United Nations as set out in the Preamble and Articles 1 and 2 of the
Charter of the United Nations.
In addition, Article 12(3) of the QD states that exclusion grounds (a–c) also apply “to
persons who incite or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts
mentioned therein”. Unlike the QD, the Refugee Convention does not directly determine
forms of criminal liability other than the direct liability that may lead to exclusion.
However, it is generally recognised that indirect forms of responsibility may also justify
exclusion.11
Originally, the exclusion clause in Article 1 F of the Refugee Convention was intended
to deny the benefits of refugee status for persons who would otherwise qualify as refugees
but who were considered as “undeserving” of such benefits because there were “serious
reasons for considering” that they had committed heinous acts or serious common crimes.
The exclusion clause was also created to ensure that such persons do not misuse the
asylum institution for escaping justice and avoiding being held accountable for their
actions.12 The aim of the provision is to protect the integrity and credibility of the asylum
institution.13 Terrorist acts are likely to be considered under the scope of the exclusion
clause, even though there is no internationally agreed definition of such acts.14
Furthermore, national security has sometimes been referred to when justifying exclusion,
even though the provision does not require the person to be a threat to the national security
of a state.15 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (hereafter,
UNHCR), basing exclusion on a determination that the applicant constitutes a risk to the
security of the host country would be contrary to the object and purpose of Article 1 F
and the conceptual framework of the Refugee Convention.16 Both the Refugee

Convention and the QD deal with the concerns of national security in different
provisions.17 The provision related to national security legitimises the refoulement of a
refugee who is considered as a danger to the security of the state in which they are present,
or who has been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime and thus
constitutes a danger to the community of that state.
When comparing the security-based provision to the exclusion clause, the exclusion
clause denies the Refugee Convention’s applicability ratione personae.18 Therefore,
because the Refugee Convention does not apply to excluded individuals, the refoulement
of an excludable person otherwise eligible for international protection is similarly
possible as the refoulement of persons on national security grounds. However, the
provision on national security in the QD has additional limitations for the refoulement of
refugees that are also applicable to excludable persons: the expulsion is only legitimate
in situations in which the international obligations related to the principle of nonrefoulement do not prohibit the act. These international obligations are formulated in
various human rights treaties.19 In addition, supervisory bodies of these treaties, such as
the European Court of Human Rights (hereafter, the ECtHR), have acknowledged that
the prohibition of refoulement is absolute.20 Therefore, whatever the reason for expulsion,
a person cannot be refouled if the risk of torture or ill-treatment after removal exists.
Consequently, in relation to the expulsion on the ground of national security and on the
basis of the application of the exclusion clause, it is highly probable that the principle of
non-refoulement prohibits the expulsion because in both cases it has been disclosed that
the person in question has a well-founded fear of persecution.
After the events of 9/11, asylum applicants and refugees have been considered as
suspected security threats.21 Many scholars have argued that security concerns have put
pressure on the EU asylum policy and led to the strengthening of national and EU asylum

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights (hereafter, ECHR)
the principle of non-refoulement has been developed under the general prohibition of torture and other
forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

laws.22 Therefore, notwithstanding the separate application of the exclusion clause and
the national security-based provision, the concerns of national security, especially in
relation to terrorism, may have affected both the application and interpretation of the
exclusion clause. Terrorist acts and other affiliations with terrorist groups have been
increasingly identified as excludable acts.23 However, the proper application of the
exclusion clause should make it impossible that terrorists benefit from the protection
provided for refugees.24
Returning to the asylum cases of the individuals described at the beginning of this chapter,
it must be revealed that the cases are not fictitious; these individuals have been asylum
applicants in different member states of the EU. The respective national courts handling
their asylum cases referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereafter, CJEU
or the Court) for preliminary rulings in relation to the application of the exclusion clause.
These are also the most relevant cases referred to in this thesis. The cases, B and D and
Lounani, have noteworthy characteristics. Based on the questions that the respective
national courts referred to the CJEU, the Court had to decide on the application of the EU
counter terrorism measures in the context of application of the exclusion clause. The
European Court of Justice (hereafter, the ECJ) (now the CJEU) took the stance in B and
D that the instruments relating to terrorism should be kept separate from the interpretation
of the QD.25 In Lounani, the CJEU held that the QD is not directly referring to any EU
instrument adopted in the context of combating terrorism.26 In addition to its
determination of the separation of these fields of law, the CJEU actively applied the EU
law on counter terrorism to determine the scope of Article 12(2).27

See e.g. CJEU, Joined Cases C-57/09 and C-101/09, B and D, 9 November 2010, para.81. In this case,
the CJEU determined that the perpetrators of terrorist acts cannot benefit from the political crime exception
of exclusion ground (b), even if such acts were committed with a purportedly political objective.

QD in terms of their respective aims. This case did not consider the application of the exclusion clause but
of a revocation of a residence permit. CJEU, Case C-373/13, H.T, 24 June 2015, para. 88.

Research Question and Limitations

The central research question is: To what extent and under what requirements may the
EU counter terrorism law be used to assist in the interpretation of the exclusion of
members of terrorist groups from refugee status for participation in acts against the
purposes and principles of the UN under article 12(2)(c) of the QD? The research
question is divided into two sub-questions, which are discussed particularly in the context
of the application of counter terrorism law for the interpretation of exclusion ground (c):
When an organisation is considered as a terrorist group, what kind of activity undertaken
by such a group might constitute acts against the purposes and principle of the UN? Under
what requirements a member of a terrorist group may be held individually responsible for
participation in the acts of such a group?
Making unjustified linkages between terrorism and asylum should be avoided.28
However, it is recognised that those linkages, whether existing or hypothetical, are an
ever-growing topic in the public debate, and may affect legislative efforts at both regional
and national levels.29 The topic of linkages between security concerns, particularly
terrorism, and asylum and migration policies in the EU has received significant research
attention since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.30 The topic is still relevant because of the
increasing numbers of asylum applicants and the recent refugee crisis in 2015–2016,31
which means that the EU’s asylum laws and practices are increasingly being followed
and applied by the member states. This thesis analyses how EU law on counter terrorism
has affected EU asylum law in relation to the interpretation of exclusion ground (c), and
to what extent the counter terrorism law can be used to guide the interpretation of the said
28

Lubbers 2002; UNHCR Background Note 2003, para. 84.
See eg. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, COM (2016) 466 final,
pp. 13, 22, 37. The Proposal for the Qualification Regulation (hereafter, QR) intermingles the exclusion
clause and terrorism more comprehensively than the QD: It is proposed in Recital 31 to expand the text
concerning exclusion ground (b) as followed: “Committing a political crime is not in principle a ground
justifying exclusion from refugee status. However, in accordance with relevant case law of the Court of
Justice of the European Union, particularly cruel actions, where the act in question is disproportionate to
the alleged political objective, and terrorist acts which are characterised by their violence towards civilian
populations, even if committed with a purportedly political objective, should be regarded as non-political
crimes and therefore can give rise to exclusion from refugee status.” The text in Article 12(2)(b) of QD
does not explicitly involve such acts, even though it has been established in the case law of the CJEU that
the acts of that nature are covered by exclusion ground (b). See in that regard, CJEU, Joined Cases C-57/09
and C-101/09, B and D, 9 November 2010, para. 81.

exclusion ground. The aim of the analysis is to determine the content of exclusion ground
(c) in terrorism related cases so that its application will be more predictable for asylum
seekers suspected of relevant terrorism related acts. This will ensure that the principles of
international refugee law are not overridden by the securitisation aspects when using EU
counter terrorism law as an interpretative guidance for the application of the exclusion
clause. Therefore, the broader context of international refugee law is considered when
analysing the research question.
The research question is current and thus relevant since only limited research has emerged
after the two major developments that are of relevance for the application of exclusion
ground (c) in relation to members of terrorist groups. First, in 2017 the CJEU gave a
judgment in Lounani in which it widely applied EU counter terrorism law as an
interpretative tool for exclusion ground (c), as explained above. Second, in the same year,
the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on combating terrorism and
replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and amending Council Decision
2005/671/JHA32 (hereafter, Terrorism Directive) was adopted.33 This thesis focuses
especially on the relevance of these new developments in relation to the research question.
However, because the exclusion clause has traditionally been interpreted in the context
of international criminal law,34 these developed practices are also referred to in the
analysis or used in comparison with the new interpretative tools.
This thesis is limited to studying exclusion for the reason of the asylum applicant being
guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN (i.e., exclusion ground
[c]). Acts in relation to terrorism may, in certain conditions, meet any of the definitions
described in subparagraphs (a–c) of the exclusion clause. However, states are increasingly
relying on exclusion ground (c) in relation to exclusion based on affiliation with
terrorism.35 The CJEU has applied exclusion grounds (b) and (c) in cases that have a
confluence to terrorism.36 In addition, this thesis is limited to situations in which it is a

32

Directive (EU) 2017/541 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2017 on combating
terrorism and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and amending Council Decision

question of participation in the acts against the purposes and principles of the UN. The
asylum procedure does not include a thorough examination of the facts as that included
in the criminal investigation. Essentially, the decision is based on the story provided by
the asylum applicant. Therefore, it may be difficult to establish that the person is directly
involved in the commission of an excludable crime or act, unless the person admits to the
commission of such a crime. However, the acts of the organisation of which the asylum
seeker has been a member may be more straightforwardly defined through reports from
international human rights organisations or other reporting institutions. Therefore, in
many cases the exclusion may be applicable when the asylum seeker has participated in
excludable acts through their membership of a specific organisation.
In both B and D and Lounani, the CJEU assessed the exclusion of members of terrorist
groups on two levels. On the collective level, the CJEU examines whether the group with
which the asylum applicant is affiliated has committed acts falling within the scope of the
exclusion clause. On the individual level, the member’s participation in the groups’
excludable acts is assessed.37 The structure of the analysis in this thesis follows these
stages. In Chapter 2, the terrorist nature and the acts and activities of terrorist groups are
analysed. In Chapter 3, the individual responsibility of a member of a terrorist group is
discussed.
1.3 Method and Sources
The research methodology used in this study is legal dogmatics or doctrinal legal
research. Legal dogmatics is used to interpret and systematise formally valid legal rules
and to weigh and balance legal principles and other legal standards that enjoy adequate
institutional support and societal approval so as to have legal significance.38 Doctrinal
legal research is suitable to study topics that seek to systematise legal norms and to
understand the relationship between different bodies of legal norms.39 Legal dogmatics is
a suitable method for this thesis since the application of exclusion ground (c) in the
context of members of terrorist organisations is determined, which requires application
and interpretation of legal norms from different fields of EU law.

In pure legal positivism, a strict separation of morals and law prevails. In addition, only
traditional legal sources such as treaties and custom are applied in strict legal positivism.40
The research question is examined in the framework of EU law that is sui generis, and
thus separate from international and national law.41 The legal sources of the acquis
communautaire include, in principle, the written law, general principles of law, and the
case law of the CJEU. EU law does not contain customary law.42 However, the EU asylum
law originates from international refugee law and especially from the Refugee
Convention and the Protocol. Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union43 (hereafter, the TFU), states that the EU’s common policy on international
protection must be in accordance with the Refugee Convention and the Protocol and other
relevant treaties44. Therefore, besides using the sources of the EU law, also these
international sources are considered.
Refugee law is closely linked to international humanitarian law and international human
rights law. The UNHCR Executive Committee has called on states to protect refugees in
compliance with their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law
instruments.45 Furthermore, in its Aydin Salahadin Abdulla and Others judgment, the
CJEU established that the QD must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
fundamental rights and principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights.46 The European Convention for Human Rights (ECHR) as well as
case law of the ECtHR are also relevant for European asylum law. However, the ECtHR
system is only concerned if the expulsion of asylum seekers and other foreigners is
forbidden under the principle of non-refoulement established under Article 3 of the
Convention. Therefore, the ECHR framework does not cover the contents of exclusion
assessment or the requirements under which persons may be excluded from international
protection.

The European Council’s Tampere Conclusions in 1999 (hereafter, Tampere Conclusions)
constitute the founding act of the Common European Asylum System (hereafter, CEAS).
In this key document, the European Council “has agreed to work towards establishing a
Common European Asylum System, based on the full and inclusive application of the
Geneva Convention”.47 The CEAS today contains several legislative instruments that are
part of EU asylum law. The principal legislative instrument of CEAS used as a source in
this study is the QD.48 The exclusion clause is examined in relation to QD Article
12(2)(c), which considers acts against the purposes and principles of the UN. EU asylum
law originates from international refugee law, especially from the Refugee Convention
and Protocol. Article 78 of the TFU states that the EU’s common policy on international
protection must be in accordance with the Refugee Convention and Protocol and other
relevant treaties. This is also recognised in the Preamble of the QD.49 According to Recital
4 in the Preamble of the QD, the cornerstone of the international legal regime for the
protection of refugees lies in the Refugee Convention and Protocol. Therefore, it is
recognised in CJEU case law that the QD must be interpreted in light of its general scheme
and purpose, and in a manner consistent with the Refugee Convention and other relevant
treaties referred to in Article 78(1) of the TFU.50 In addition, secondary sources
interpreting the exclusion clause in the context of the Refugee Convention may be of
relevance when interpreting the contents of the exclusion clause in EU asylum law. It is
also recognised that guidance provided by the UNHCR is of importance in the refugee
status determination process, including the exclusion assessment. 51 The guiding status of
the UNHCR Handbook has also been recognised in CJEU case law.52 Similarly, the CJEU

De Bruycker; and Maiani (eds), 2016. The CEAS is currently under reform. The reform of the QD
demonstrated above is also part of this reform.
48
The legislative instruments of the CEAS currently in force are the Asylum Procedures Directive; the
Reception Conditions Directive; the Dublin Regulation; and the EURODAC Regulation. However, these
instruments are not relevant in the analysis of the topic of this thesis.

has referred to reports of the European Asylum Support Office (hereafter, EASO) for
guidance.53
The use of international criminal law and EU law on counter terrorism as sources for this
research on asylum law requires deeper explanation. The exclusion assessment is
predominantly different from the inclusion part of the refugee status determination
process. For inclusion, the relevant legal framework may be regarded to include not only
asylum law but also international human rights law and international humanitarian law54
whereas for the exclusion process, international criminal law is also relevant.55 For
example, the general principles of criminal liability have been widely used as an
interpretative guidance to establish the individual responsibility in the context of the
exclusion clause. 56 Therefore, the main sources of international criminal law used in this
thesis are the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court57 (hereafter, the Rome
Statute), and the case law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (hereafter, ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(hereafter, ICTR).
Recent CJEU case law has also shown that EU law in relation to counter terrorism is of
increasing relevance in cases that involve persons affiliated with terrorist groups and the
exclusion clause. The relevant sources of European counter terrorism law include the
Terrorism Directive. Even though the Council Framework Decision (13 June 2002) on
combating terrorism (2002/475/JHA) (hereafter, Framework Decision (2002/475)) has
been replaced with the above-mentioned Terrorism Directive, scholarly documents
commenting on the Framework Decision (2002/475) may be used as sources as many of
the articles within the Terrorism Directive correspond to articles within the Framework
Decision (2002/475). The Council Common Position (27 December 2001) on the
application of specific measures to combat terrorism (2001/931/CFSP) (hereafter,

12(2) concerning exclusion from refugee status.

Council (hereafter, UNSC) Resolution 1373 (2001). ).58 In Article 2 of the Common
Position (2001/931), the European Community is requested to order the freezing of the
funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons groups and entities
listed in the Annex. The Annex to the Common Position (2001/931) thus contains a list
of persons, groups, and entities involved in terrorist acts.59 Article 1(4) of the Common
Position (2001/931) sets the basis for the process of adding persons, groups, and entities
on the list in the Annex. In addition, persons, groups, and entities identified by the UNSC
as being related to terrorism and against whom it has ordered sanctions may also be
included in the list.60 The list may be reviewed at regular intervals and at least once in
every six months.61
National case law of the Member States of the EU is used when it is referencing the
relevant EU law. In addition, national law and cases are only used as examples.
1.4 EU Counter Terrorism Law as a Guidance for the Interpretation of Article
12(2)(c)
The principles of interpretation are regulated in the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (hereafter, Vienna Convention). Interpretation of treaties is regulated in the
Section 3 of the Vienna Convention. Article 31 contains the general rule of interpretation:
1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose.
2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:
(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the
parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;
(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection
with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an
instrument related to the treaty.
3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:
(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;
(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes
the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.
4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the
parties so intended.
Article 32 of the Vienna Convention includes the supplementary means of interpretation:
Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including
the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,
in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31,
or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:
(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.
The ECJ has affirmed that the Union has its own legal system.62 Thus, the EU law is
considered sui generis, and it is not subject to the interpretative principles of public
international law. However, the articles of the Vienna Convention considering
interpretation of treaties may be relevant for the interpretation of the Refugee Convention
as an international treaty.63 In addition, it is recognized that the Refugee Convention is a
living instrument that must be interpreted and applied in the light of present-day
conditions and in accordance with developments in international law.64
The UNHCR has underlined that even though the exclusion clause is subject to
interpretation, it cannot be modified or amended without the explicit agreement between
the contracting parties.65 Exclusion ground (c) should be interpreted narrowly and with
caution in light of the purposes and object of the Refugee Convention.66 The main purpose
of the Refugee Convention is asserted in its Preamble: to assure refugees the widest
possible exercise of their fundamental rights and freedoms.67 Therefore, the interpretation
of the exclusion clause (c) should be guided by the awareness of that exclusion has an
effect upon fundamentally important legally protected rights. In addition, the systematic
context of the exclusion clause and the overall protective purpose of the Refugee
Convention should be regarded.68

The EU itself is not a party to the Refugee Convention. However, all its member states
are parties to that convention. International agreements concluded by EU member states
and not the Union itself are not binding on the EU institutions under public international
law.69 However, the special status of the Refugee Convention has been recognized in
Article 78 of the TFEU and in the Preamble of the QD as explained above.
The interpretation methods used by the CJEU correspond to the rules of interpretation in
the Vienna Convention to some extent.70 Secondary legislation, such as the QD, is
interpreted in light of the wording, the systemic structure, the drafting history, the
objectives and the requirements of human rights or international law and the unwritten
general principles of Union law.71 The provisions of the QD, the exclusion clause
included, must be interpreted in light of its general purpose and scheme and in
harmonization with the Refugee Convention.72 The QD is a humanitarian instruments
which main aim is to ensure for those genuinely in need the minimum level of protection
in all EU member states.73 One of the main objectives is also to ensure that all member
states apply common criteria for the identification of such persons.74 Because exclusion
constitutes an exception to a general rule, it should be interpreted strictly.75
EU asylum law and EU counter-terrorism law have different legal bases in the EU acquis.
The QD and the Terrorism Directive are based in different sections of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The legal basis of the QD lies in Article
78(2) (a) and (b) of the TFEU that is in Chapter 2 concerning policies on border check,
asylum and immigration. In comparison, the Terrorism Directive has its legal basis in
Article 83(1) of TFEU that lies in Chapter 4 concerning judicial cooperation in criminal
matters.

The main aim of EU counter-terrorism regulations is to fight terrorism by means of
harmonization or approximation of criminal law.76 The purpose of the Terrorism
Directive is to implement the most recent international standards and obligations in
relation to counter terrorism to the EU law so as to adequately respond to the emerging
terrorist threat.77 In general, the purpose of modern counter terrorism regulations is the
prevention of attacks rather than the pursuit of perpetrators.78 Already Council
Framework Decision 2008/919/JHA of 28 November 2008 amending Framework
Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism (hereafter, Amended Framework
Decision (2008/919)) recognized the general policy objective of preventing terrorism.79
What is central in this research is the application of the EU counter terrorism law as
guiding the interpretation of certain key concepts of the exclusion clause, and especially
exclusion ground (c). In the interpretation of the EU asylum law, it is important to
recognize that EU immigration and asylum legislation sometimes include similar
terminology used in legislative acts in other areas of EU law, and that these concepts may
have separate meanings.80 This hypothesis emerges between certain concepts used in the
EU counter terrorism regulations and the terminology of exclusion ground (c), such as
the “participation in terrorist acts”. In this regard, the CJEU supports the coherence of EU
law and attempts to interpret similar concepts in an identical way when possible. This
may mean that concepts developed in other parts of EU law are applied to asylum
instruments.81 Such interpretation method also supports the object of harmonizing the
application of the EU asylum law in general, and exclusion ground (c) in particular.
Nevertheless, the EU counter terrorism regulations may only be used as assisting the
interpretation of these concepts, but it cannot determine the scope of application of the
exclusion clause. That would be inconsistent with the suggestion that the Refugee
Convention constitutes the cornerstone of the international legal regime for the protection

of exclusion ground (c) even in the context of the EU law.
2. Exclusion Assessment on the Collective Level in Relation to Terrorist Groups
2.1

Acts Contrary to the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations

In this chapter, exclusion ground (c) relating to terrorism is discussed on the collective
level. The discussion considers the terrorist group and its acts and activities. The
exclusion assessment on the collective level may be derived into two different stages.
Firstly, a determination is made as to whether the group the person concerned was a
member of is terrorist in nature. Secondly, it is determined whether that group has
committed acts falling within the scope of exclusion ground (c) during the relevant time
the asylum applicant was a member.83 However, the content of acts contrary to the
purposes and principles of the UN are discussed first.
The purposes and principles of the UN to which exclusion ground (c) refers are described
in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter of the United Nations (hereafter, UN Charter).84 The
objectives of the UN may be summarised as follows: international peace and security;
friendly relations among nations; international cooperation in solving international
problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting
respect for human rights; and to serve as a centre for harmonising the actions of nations.
The summarised version of the principles of the UN are: sovereign equality of its
members; good faith fulfilment of obligations by members; peaceful settlement of
international disputes; refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any state; assistance in any action the UN takes and
refraining from giving assistance to states against which the UN is taking action; ensuring

53. Advocate General Sharpston determines that the scope and purpose of the QD and Article 1 of the
Framework Decision (2002/475) are not the same. She also concludes that “[t]he Qualification Directive
was adopted almost two years after the Framework Decision. The legislator could have included an express
reference to the latter. However he did not do so, perhaps because a restriction of that nature would probably
have been inconsistent with the Geneva Convention.”

that states that are not members of the UN act in accordance with the principles; and the
UN has no authorisation to intervene in matters of domestic jurisdiction.
It is difficult to derive the types of acts that are meant in exclusion ground (c) from the
purposes and principles described in Articles 1 and 2 of the UN Charter because these
articles are so broad and general in character.85 Originally, the intention of the drafters of
the Refugee Convention was to cover violations of human rights in exclusion ground (c)
that were not already covered in exclusion grounds (a) and (b) but that were nevertheless
of similar exceptional character.86 During the negotiations on Article 1F(c) of the Refugee
Convention, Pakistan’s representative observed that the ground was “so vague as to be
open to abuse by governments wishing to exclude refugees”.87 The vagueness of the
article makes it difficult to define what kind of acts fall into the category or who may
commit such acts.88
To determine what kind of terrorism related activity may be considered as against the
purposes and principles of the UN, the relevant UNSC terrorism related resolutions
should be examined. In Resolution 1373 (2001), the UNSC stressed that Member States
are obliged to take appropriate measures before granting refugee status to ensure that the
asylum seeker has not planned, facilitated, or participated in the commission of terrorist
acts. Refugee status should not be abused by the perpetrators, organisers, or facilitators
of terrorist acts. The UNSC also declared that “acts, methods, and practices of terrorism
are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and that knowingly
financing, planning and inciting terrorist acts are also contrary to the purposes and
principles of the United Nations”.89 Resolution 1377 (2001) confirmed this stance and
also added in its preamble that the “preparation of as well as any other form of support
for acts of international terrorism” are also contrary to the purposes and principles of the
UN.90
In Resolution 1624 (2005), the UNSC called upon states to adopt measures with a view
to deny safe haven to any persons with respect to whom there is credible and relevant

information giving serious reasons for considering that the person has been guilty of
incitement to terrorist acts. It is also stressed in this resolution that any measures to
combat terrorism must comply with, inter alia, refugee law and humanitarian law.91 The
most recent is Resolution 2178 (2014), in which the UNSC expressed its concern over
the growing threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. In this resolution, the UNSC
emphasises that states are obliged to prosecute and punish persons who support terrorism
by recruiting, organising, equipping and transporting individuals to a state other than their
states of residence for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, preparation of, and
participation in terrorist acts.92
The UNSC resolutions related to combating terrorism cover a wide variety of terrorism
related acts and activities that are declared concerning, and which states should prevent
and suppress. However, the resolutions do not contain a clear definition of terrorism,93
nor is there a common, internationally accepted definition in international law.94
Therefore, it is problematic that the above-mentioned UNSC resolutions promote the
exclusion of asylum applicants on the grounds of terrorism without any clear legal
definition of the term.95 The UNHCR is concerned that the absence of such a legal
definition may lead to an overly extensive application of exclusion ground (c) in relation
to terrorism related activity.96 In the EU context, the concept of terrorism is defined first
in the Framework Decision (2002/475) and the Common Position (2001/931), and more
recently in the Terrorism Directive. Therefore, in the EU context it may be justified to
refer to the EU counter terrorism legislation, mainly the Terrorism Directive, for
interpreting the terrorism related concepts in the application of exclusion ground (c).97
Due to the vagueness of the concept of “acts contrary to the purposes and principles of
the UN”, the UNHCR has also advised that it is important to read Article 1F(c) narrowly
and to use a high threshold for acts mentioned in the article.98 Acts that can lead to

See Goodwin-Gill and McAdam 2007, p. 194. However, in Resolution 1566 (2004), the UNSC recalled

terrorism” should be understood.

92

18

exclusion under Article 1F(c) are those that offend the purposes and principles of the UN
in a fundamental manner. They are acts that attack the very basis of the international
community’s coexistence. Such acts can affect international peace, security, and peaceful
relations between states. In addition, serious and sustained violations of human rights may
be included in the category.99 The requirement to interpret the article restrictively has
been derived from these UNHCR statements. In addition, the act must be of a sufficient
gravity and have international implications.100 The terrorism related activity outlined in
the Terrorism Directive is analysed against these requirements in the following subchapters.
2.2

Terrorist Nature of a Group

In B and D, the CJEU determined that the terrorist nature of a group of which the asylum
applicant was a member is a factor that must be taken into account in the exclusion
assessment. 101 In its guidelines for the exclusion assessment, the UNHCR stresses the
importance of analysing the violent nature of the organisation of which the asylum
applicant was a member.102 Although both these concepts refer mainly to terrorist groups,
the contents of the analysis in relation to them is considerably different.
According to the UNHCR, when considering the violent nature of a group, the actual
activities of the group, the organisation’s place and role in the society in which it operates,
and its organisational structure must be carefully examined.103 In addition, the
fragmentation of certain organisations should be considered.104 The fragmentation of
organisations is considered in more detail in the United Kingdom (hereafter, the UK)
immigration tribunal’s decision in Gurung v. Secretary of State for the Home Department.
In its decision, the tribunal explained that when comparing organisations through their

phrase should be interpreted very restrictively”. See also CJEU, Opinion of Advocate General, Joined Cases

violent character, on one end of the continuum are organisations that may have significant
support amongst the population. In addition, the political aims and objectives may include
political, social, economic and cultural issues. The long term aims of such organisations
include a parliamentary, democratic mode of government and the safeguarding of basic
human rights. Such organisations may have had, in a limited way or for a limited time, a
military wing in a response to atrocities committed by a dictatorial government.
At the other end of the continuum are organisations that have little or no political agenda,
or if they originally had genuine political aims and objectives, they have now come to
focus on terrorism as the mode of operation. The recruitment policy, structure, and
strategy of those organisations have increasingly concentrated on the execution of
terrorist acts that are seen as a way of winning the war against the enemy, even though
the chosen targets are primarily civilian. Such organisations may also strive for
authoritarian government and disregard fundamental human rights.105 The UNHCR has
further determined that after carefully assessing the nature of the organisation, members
of groups whose purposes, activities, and methods are of a particularly violent nature,
could be presumed to have individual responsibility for the acts of the group, and thus be
excluded from refugee status.106 Examples of “particular violent nature” include
indiscriminately killing or injuring of members of the civilian population or acts of
torture.107
An emerging trend in some states that are party to the Refugee Convention is increased
concentration on the level of participation of the individual in the commission of an
Article 1 F crime or act, rather than considering the nature of the organisation of which
the individual was a member.108 A similar trend is noticeable in the CJEU’s two
preliminary rulings for B and D and Lounani, which consider the exclusion of members
of terrorist organisations. In these cases, the CJEU has determined that no presumption
of individual responsibility is allowed in relation to members of terrorist groups, and the

exclusion assessment must always include an individual analysis of all the facts of the
case. 109
The CJEU’s analysis in relation to the nature of the group is different from the UNHCR’s
analysis because it only requires analysis of the terrorist nature of the group rather than
the violent nature of the group.110 The concept of “terrorist group” is defined in Article
2(3) of the Terrorism Directive as “a structured group of more than two persons,
established for a period of time and acting in concert to commit terrorist offences;
‘structured group’ means a group that is not randomly formed for the immediate
commission of an offence and that does not need to have formally defined roles for its
members, continuity of its membership or a developed structure”.111 However, based on
CJEU case law, it seems that an assessment of whether a group fulfils this definition of a
terrorist group is not required if the group appears on a list of terrorist organisations.
The CJEU determined in B and D that the terrorist nature of the group to which an asylum
applicant is associated can be established if the group has been added to the list forming
the Annex to Common Position (2001/931).112 The Court confirmed this stance in H.T.,
where it concluded that the inclusion of an organisation on a list annexed to Common
Position (2001/931) is a strong indication that the group is, in fact, a terrorist organisation
or at least is suspected of being such an organisation.113 Furthermore, in Lounani, the
CJEU does not otherwise analyse the nature of the organisation of which Lounani was a
member, but only refers to its registration (on 10 October 2002) on the UN list that
identifies certain individuals and entities that are subject to sanctions, and to the fact that
the organisation of which Lounani was a member continues to be named on that list.114

110
See CJEU, Opinion of Advocate General C-573/14, Lounani, 31 May 2016, paras. 92-95. Advocate
General Sharpston states that the terrorist organisation does not need to have made any acts of a particularly
cruel nature so that the exclusion clause may be applied.
111
The definition of a terrorist group in the Terrorism Directive corresponds to the definition of such a
group in Article 1(3) of the Common Position (2001/931) and Article 2(1) of the Framework Decision
(2002/475).

General C-573/14, Lounani, 31 May 2016, para. 36. Advocate General Sharpston considered that the listing
of the terrorist group in question on the UN Sanctions list had not been questioned and therefore, the present
proceedings are based on that that the MICG is validly categorised by the UN as a terrorist organisation.
She was referring to the CJEU case A and Others, in which the Court considers the definition of a terrorist
organisation in international law, and which was at that time still in the pipeline.

21

Therefore, it appears that this part of the exclusion analysis is solely covered by referring
to the relevant lists of terrorist groups, and whether, if the group in question is found on
such a list, its terrorist nature has been established.
The listing has another purpose in the assessment of the nature of the organisation. As the
requirements derived from UN resolutions state that only acts of international terrorism
are regarded as against the purposes and principles of the UN, the excludable terrorist
activity must have an international dimension.115 Therefore, the precondition for the
application of exclusion ground (c) is that the terrorist group operates internationally.116
Consequently, there is a distinction between international and domestic terrorism.117 In
Lounani, the CJEU determined that the international dimension of a terrorist group is
satisfied if the group in question has been entered in the UN Sanctions List.118
In some cases, it may appear problematic if a group’s features are not analysed further
than the inclusion on the UN or EU terrorist lists.119 Groups that have been listed as
terrorist groups may have wings or branches that are separate from the military or terrorist
wing. Some of the listed terrorist groups may also be armed groups involved in noninternational armed conflicts and, in addition to the military wing, they may have, for
example, political divisions, human rights wings, or humanitarian relief branches.120
Groups may be fragmented in such a way that they have moderate and extremist cells, or
the objectives and strategies may have changed over time.121 When only concentrating on
the listing of a group, the fragmentation of such groups is disregarded; thus, in this kind
of analysis groups that are particularly violent appear to be on the same level as more
moderate groups.

See also UNHCR Background Note 2003, para. 109. It is questionable, whether other lists of terrorist
groups except the UN and EU terrorist lists would even be relevant in the exclusion assessment, as national
lists of terrorist organisations tend to have low evidentiary threshold in relation to the inclusion of an
organisation to such a list, because no international consensus is needed for the act.

The lack of more thorough analysis in relation to the nature of the group is covered, to
some extent, in the following step in the exclusion assessment: assessment in relation to
relevant acts of the listed terrorist organisation. Inclusion on lists of terrorist organisations
does not necessarily mean that the group in question has committed any excludable acts.
Such a listing is only one factor to consider when assessing whether the organisation has
committed acts falling within the scope of exclusion ground (c).122
2.3

Terrorist Acts

In Resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1377 (2001) the UNSC determined that acts of
international terrorism are a threat to international peace and security and thus are
contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN. However, as previously explained,
“terrorism” has no clear or universally agreed definition.123 Therefore, in the UNHCR’s
view, labelling a particular act, person, or group as terrorist in nature is not enough to
determine the act excludable or to justify exclusion. Rather than focusing on the label, it
is necessary to determine whether the acts of the organisation constitute acts such as those
described in Article 1 F(c).124
In B and D, the CJEU determined that the acts committed by a terrorist organisation must
meet the conditions laid down in the exclusion clause. It must be determined whether the
terrorist organisation has committed acts against the purposes and principles of the UN
during the relevant period the asylum applicant was a member.125 In relation to exclusion
ground (c), the Court observed that it is clear from UNSC Resolutions 1373 (2001) and
1377 (2001) that international terrorist acts are, generally speaking and irrespective of
any state participation, contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN.126 Therefore,
the Court concluded that terrorist acts with an “international dimension” fall within the

122

CJEU, Joined Cases C-57/09 and C-101/09, B and D, 9 November 2010, paras. 90–91 and Section 1 of
the Operative part of the judgment. See also CJEU, Case C-373/13, H.T, 24 June 2015, para. 83. See also
UNHCR Background Note 2003, paras. 106, 109. The UNHCR has underlined that if an asylum seeker is
a member of an organisation that is included in an international list of terrorist organisations, that fact does
not in itself satisfy the “serious reasons to consider” test. However, this kind of fact must trigger the
consideration of the exclusion clauses. According to the UNHCR, the evidentiary threshold for inclusion
to such lists is likely much lower than the “serious reasons to consider” test, because the terrorist lists are
drawn up in a political process rather than in a judicial one.
123
See Saul 2006, p. 57. The problem to establish such a general definition lies fundamentally in political
disagreements, since technically that would be possible.

scope of the exclusion clause.127 However, the Court did not further define the concept of
a terrorist act in the context of the exclusion clause.
According to Goodwin-Gill and McAdam exclusion ground (c) ought only to be applied,
when the act conforms to an offence that the international community has specifically
identified as one which must be addressed in the fight against terrorism.128 The UNSC
attempted to define “acts of terrorism” in Resolution 1566 (2004). It called upon states to
prevent and punish such acts with penalties consistent with their grave nature:
criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause
death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to
provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or
particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an
international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act, which
constitute offences within the scope of and as defined in the international
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism…129
Terrorist acts are defined within several international and regional instruments pertaining
to terrorism.130 However, international instruments concerning terrorism have
concentrated on identifying and prohibiting certain activities that are condemned by the
whole international community rather than identifying the terrorism related motive behind
such acts.131 Article 2 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism defines a terrorist act as
an act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to
any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of
armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to
intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international
organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.132
In the EU context, terrorism related activity is thoroughly defined in the Terrorism
Directive. Both the Terrorism Directive and its predecessor, the Framework Decision
(2002/475), define three categories of terrorism related conduct that Member States are
required to criminalise. These are terrorist offences in Article 3, offences relating to a

The terrorist offences regulated in Article 3 may be regarded as the principal terrorist
acts.133 The European Commission’s Proposal for the Terrorism Directive explains that
terrorist acts are offences that become terrorist offences by reason of the motivation of
the offender. Therefore, a terrorist act consists of an objective and a subjective element,
meaning the actual offence and the specific intent.134 Article 3(1)135 defines the following
intentional acts, as defined as offences under national law, which, given their nature or
context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation, as terrorist
offences:
(a) attacks upon a person’s life which may cause death;
(b) attacks upon the physical integrity of a person;
(c) kidnapping or hostage-taking;
(d) causing extensive destruction to a government or public facility, a
transport system, an infrastructure facility, including an information system,
a fixed platform located on the continental shelf, a public place or private
property likely to endanger human life or result in major economic loss;
(e) seizure of aircraft, ships or other means of public or goods transport;
(f) manufacture, possession, acquisition, transport, supply or use of
explosives or weapons, including chemical, biological, radiological or
nuclear weapons, as well as research into, and development of, chemical,
biological, radiological or nuclear weapons;
(g) release of dangerous substances, or causing fires, floods or explosions,
the effect of which is to endanger human life;
(h) interfering with or disrupting the supply of water, power or any other
fundamental natural resource, the effect of which is to endanger human life;
(i) illegal system interference, as referred to in Article 4136 of Directive
2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council in cases where

135
The list of acts in Article 3(1) of the Terrorism Directive corresponds to the list of acts regarded as
terrorist offences in the Framework Decision (2002/475). Only addition is the point (i) that refers to
Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against
information systems and considers illegal system interference and illegal data interference.
136
Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks
against information systems and replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA (OJ L 218,
14.8.2013, p. 8). Hereafter, Directive on Attacks against Information Systems. Article 4 of the Directive on
Attacks against Information Systems considers illegal system interference reads as followed: “Member
134

25

Article 9(3)137 or point (b) or (c) of Article 9(4)138 of that Directive applies,
and illegal data interference, as referred to in Article 5139 of that Directive
in cases where point (c) of Article 9(4) of that Directive applies;
(j) threatening to commit any of the acts listed in points (a) to (i).
The list of terrorist offences is extensive, and many kinds of acts may be regarded as
terrorist offences. The definition of terrorist acts codifies the most important aspects of
the UN conventions against terrorism. However, the article has even wider scope and
some of the points cannot be found in UN conventions and protocols, such as point (h)
protecting natural resource supplies, and point (j) criminalising the threat to commit the
offences listed in points (a) to (i).140 However, all acts may fall under the far-reaching
nature of relevant UNSC resolutions concerning terrorism. The article also has a
requirement of seriousness that is assessed based on the nature or context of the offence
in relation to the notion that it may seriously damage a country or an international
organisation. Nevertheless, not all the acts described in points (a) to (j) would fulfil the
gravity requirement demanded in the application of exclusion ground (c).141
In B and D, the CJEU did not analyse the gravity of the terrorist acts of the terrorist groups
in question. It determined based on the relevant UNSC resolutions that international
terrorist acts are against the purposes and principles of the UN. However, the CJEU

States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that seriously hindering or interrupting the functioning
of an information system by inputting computer data, by trans-mitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating,
altering or suppressing such data, or by rendering such data inaccessible, intentionally and without right, is
punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases which are not minor.”.
137
Article 9(3) of the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems: “Member States shall take the
necessary measures to ensure that the offences referred to in Articles 4 and 5, when committed intentionally,
are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least three years where a significant number of
information systems have been affected through the use of a tool, referred to in Article 7, designed or
adapted primarily for that purpose.”.
138
Article 9 of the Directive on Attacks against Information Systems considers penalties. Article 9(4)(a–c)
reads as followed: “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that offences referred to in
Articles 4 and 5 are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least five years where: (a) they
are committed within the framework of a criminal organisation, as defined in Framework Decision
2008/841/JHA, irrespective of the penalty provided for therein; (b) they cause serious damage; or (c) they
are committed against a critical infrastructure information system.”.
139
Illegal data interference is determined in Article 5 of the Directive on Attacks against Information
Systems: “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that deleting, damaging,
deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data on an information system, or rendering such data
inaccessible, intentionally and without right, is punishable as a criminal offence, at least for cases which
are not minor.”.

See UNHCR Observations on the European Commission Proposal 2001, para. 3. The UNHCR has stated
in the context of the application of the Framework Decision (2002/475) that unwarranted automaticity
between such criminal offences related to terrorism and the application of the exclusion clause should
generally be avoided.

26

appears to understand terrorist acts to cover, in particular, acts that are characterised by
their violence towards civilian populations.142 In his opinion in relation to B and D,
Advocate General Mengozzi considered that the act’s intrinsic nature and gravity is also
taken into account in the exclusion assessment.143 He noted that the UNHCR’s
recommended interpretation, which is also generally accepted both in legal literature and
in practice, is that terrorist acts insofar as they involve the use of indiscriminate violence
and are directed at civilians or persons unconnected with the objectives pursued, are
generally disproportionate to the purported political objectives and are thus categorised
as non-political crimes, as required in the application of exclusion ground (b).144 Such
acts, given their nature, the methods used, and their seriousness are considered as acts
against the purposes and principles of the UN when applying exclusion ground (c).145
Therefore, from this determination it could be stated that at least acts involving
indiscriminate violence or violence towards civilians satisfy the gravity requirement.
The definition of a terrorist offence in the Terrorism Directive does not include the word
civilian. However, most of the acts defined in the article have a requirement that the
results of the act have potential to endanger human life. Even those acts that do not have
this specific requirement, such as hostage-taking or possession of certain weapons,
emphasise the protection of human life and physical integrity of a person.146 These kinds
of acts are quite close to the definition of violence towards the civilian population and
could establish grounds for exclusion. However, not all acts covered in Article 3(1) of the
Terrorism Directive require that violence towards civilians has occurred or even that
human lives have been endangered. For example, point (d) of the article requires that the
said act147 is likely to endanger human life or result in major economic loss. Similarly,

p. 37. The proposal for QR would add an additional paragraph to Article 12 concerning exclusion.
According to Article 12(5): “For the purposes of points (b) and (c) of paragraph 2, the following acts shall
be classified as serious non-political crimes:
(a) particularly cruel actions when the act in question is disproportionate to the alleged political objective,
(b) terrorist acts, which are characterised by their violence towards civilian populations, even if committed
with a purportedly political objective.”

“…causing extensive destruction to a government or public facility, a transport system, an infrastructure

27

point (j) only considers threatening. Assessed against the background of the CJEU’s
judgment, it is questionable whether acts that may not place any human lives in danger
would be serious enough to cross the high threshold of exclusion ground (c).
The assessment of the gravity of the act also covers assessment in relation to the
fragmentation of groups.148 Some listed terrorist groups are more violent towards
civilians and in the means used to achieve their aims than other groups. Therefore, the
particularly violent nature of certain groups is considered through the above gravity
analysis of the acts of the group. As discussed above, such acts against civilians may
easily be determined as fulfilling the gravity requirement of the excludable acts.
Besides describing the specific acts, the definition of a terrorist offence also requires a
subjective element, the specific terrorist intent, that is regulated in Article 3(2) of the
Terrorism Directive. To be considered as terrorist offences, the article requires that the
acts described in Article 3(1) are committed with one of the following aims:
(a) seriously intimidating a population;
(b) unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to
perform or abstain from performing any act;
(c) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political,
constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international
organisation.
Even though the article concerning terrorist offences also covers the terrorist intent or the
terrorist aims that the act must satisfy to be regarded as a terrorist offence in the meaning
of the article, in the exclusion assessment similar intent does not appear to have relevance,
at least in relation to acts of listed terrorist groups. In the exclusion assessment, the
group’s terrorist intent in relation to its acts appears to be assumed in circumstances in
which the terrorist nature of the group is established through the listing.
2.4

Terrorist Activity

After its judgment in B and D, the CJEU expanded its determination on the application
of exclusion ground (c) from the actual terrorist acts to terrorism related activity. In the
Lounani case, the CJEU based its determination of the facts on the criminal conviction

148

See above sub-chapter 2.2: The fragmentation of certain terrorist groups is disregarded in the assessment
of the terrorist nature of a group.

28

imposed on Lounani by the local court “tribunal correctionnel Bruxelles”. The established
facts in the conviction included “providing logistical support to a terrorist group by the
provision of, inter alia, material resources or information”; “forgery of passports” and
“fraudulent transfer of passports”; and “active participation in the organisation of a
network for sending volunteers to Iraq”.149 The terrorist group of which Lounani was a
member, the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (hereafter, MICG), is linked to AlQaeda, which has committed terrorist acts against international bodies.150 Therefore, the
MICG was considered as a cell providing logistical support for a terrorist movement.151
However, no specific act of the MICG could be regarded as falling within the terrorist
offences listed in Article 1(1) of the Framework Decision (2002/475) (that mainly
correspond to the terrorist offences in Article 3(1) of the Terrorism Directive), even in
the inchoate form.152 Therefore, such activity probably would not satisfy the gravity
requirement of the indiscriminate violence discussed in the previous sub-chapter. In her
opinion on Lounani, Advocate General Sharpston denied that exclusion ground (c) would
contain a particular threshold for the violence used.153 In addition, the CJEU denied that
the Framework Decision (2002/475) and the QD would be connected in the sense that the
application of the exclusion clause would require that an actual terrorist offence has been
committed.154 The Court referred to UNSC Resolutions 1377 (2001) and 1624 (2005) and
determined that acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN are not confined
to “acts, methods and practices of terrorism”. It can be derived from the UNSC
Resolutions that “the financing, planning and preparation of, as well as any other form of
support for acts of international terrorism” are also against the purposes and principles of
the UN.155 The CJEU highlighted the importance of Resolution 2178 (2014), in which the
UNSC expressed its “grave concern over the acute and growing threat posed by foreign
terrorist fighters, namely individuals who travel to a State other than their States of
residence or nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning or preparation of …

terrorist acts”.156 In this resolution, the UNSC also expressed its concern “that
international networks have been established by terrorists and terrorist entities among
States of origin, transit and destination through which foreign terrorist fighters and the
resources to support them have been channelled back and forth”.157 In this resolution, the
UNSC also noted “that the threat of foreign terrorist fighters may affect all regions and
Member States, even those far from conflict zones”. Fundamentally, in this resolution the
UNSC considered that foreign terrorist fighters pose a threat to international peace and
security. The CJEU drew a conclusion that Article 12(2)(c) is not confined to the actual
perpetrators of terrorist acts but it also extends to those who have engaged in terrorist
activity, such as persons “who engage in activities consisting in the recruitment,
organisation, transportation or equipment of individuals who travel to a State other than
their States of residence or nationality for the purpose of, inter alia, the perpetration,
planning or preparation of terrorist acts”.158
Articles 5 to 12 of the Terrorism Directive cover offences related to terrorist activities.
These are not terrorist acts as such but may be considered as preparatory acts for
terrorism.159 They include public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment
for terrorism; providing or receiving training for terrorism; travelling for the purpose of
terrorism; organising or otherwise facilitating travel for the purpose of terrorism; terrorist
financing; and other offences related to terrorist activities160. For the offences related to
terrorist activity to become punishable, it is not necessary that a terrorist offence is
committed.161 Offences linked to terrorist activities are not committed with the defined
terrorist intent; rather, they are executed with a view to committing or contributing to
terrorist acts, but they are not the actual terrorist acts themselves.162 Therefore, a link

between the actual harm a terrorist act causes and the offences related to terrorist activities
is not required.163
Furthermore, in relation to the CJEU’s analysis in Lounani, it is not required that the
terrorist organisation had committed or even planned to commit any actual terrorist
acts.164 Terrorism linked activity is sufficient in cases where it includes some form of
support for acts of international terrorism as determined in the UNSC resolutions.165 This
is similar to the requirement in relation to offences related to terrorist activities in the
Terrorism Directive. For the offences to be punishable, there must be a purpose of
committing or contributing to the commission of the actual terrorist offences. Therefore,
the excludable terrorist activity appears to correspond to the offences related to terrorist
activities as defined in the Terrorism Directive.
All the offences related to terrorist activities in the Terrorism Directive are of a serious
nature because of their potential to lead to the commission of actual terrorist offences.
They also enable terrorists and terrorist groups to maintain and further develop their
criminal activities, which justifies the criminalisation of such conduct.166 Many of the
offences related to terrorist activities (Articles 5 to 12) are also mentioned in the UNSC
resolutions, but possibly in a simpler form. Resolution 2178 (2014) concerning foreign
terrorist fighters has been in the background of Articles 9 and 10 of the Terrorism
Directive that consider travelling or assisting travel for the purpose of terrorism.167 Article
5 of the Terrorism Directive considers public provocation to commit a terrorist offence,
which means, in a simpler form, the incitement to commit a terrorist act, which is
mentioned in Resolution 1624 (2005). This resolution calls upon all states to deny a safe
haven to any persons with respect to whom there is credible and relevant information
giving serious reasons for considering that they have been guilty of incitement to commit
a terrorist act or terrorist acts.168 Article 6 of the Terrorism Directive criminalises

and communication strategists would slip through the European and national law enforcements’ and courts’
investigations and judicial prosecution”.

recruitment for terrorism. The UNSC has expressed its concern in relation to recruiting
for terrorist groups, inter alia, in Resolutions 1373 (2001); 2161 (2014); and 2199 (2015).
Articles 7 and 8 consider providing and receiving training for terrorism. For example, in
Resolution 1989 (2011) the UNSC decided that states must, among other measures,
prevent terrorist groups from having access to technical advice, assistance or training
related to military activities. Terrorist financing is criminalised in Article 11 of the
Terrorism Directive. Financing of terrorism has also been focused on in the UNSC
resolutions. Resolution 1373 (2001) concentrates on, among other issues, the prevention
and suppression of terrorist financing. In Resolution 1377 (2001), the UNSC stressed that,
inter alia, financing acts of international terrorism is contrary to the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the UN. As a result, many of the offences related to terrorist
activities are of a notable seriousness because they have direct links to the UNSC
resolutions.
As disclosed at the beginning of this chapter, acts excludable under exclusion ground (c)
must still satisfy the gravity and internationality requirements. In fact, the CJEU’s
judgment in Lounani has been criticised because the CJEU does not appear to have
assessed the gravity of the terrorist activity, and considered that it was enough that the
acts assisting the travel of foreign terrorist fighters are directly prohibited in the UNSC
resolutions.169 If the act’s or activity’s link to a UNSC resolution was only considered in
the gravity assessment, all the offences related to terrorist activities would fall under
exclusion ground (c). However, according to the UNHCR, equating any action contrary
to the UNSC resolutions as falling within exclusion ground (c) would be inconsistent with
the object and purpose of the provision.170 The act or activity must offend the purposes
and principles of the UN in a fundamental manner, and exclusion ground (c) is only
triggered in extreme circumstances. Crimes capable of affecting international peace,
security and peaceful relations between states would fall within the exclusion grounds.

Goodwin-Gill and McAdam 2007, p. 196. Goodwin-Gill and McAdam assert that “[i]t is one thing to state
as a matter of policy that terrorism is contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, but
quite another to translate that policy into a rule of law”.
170

32

Therefore, the international implications of acts should be assessed in terms of their
seriousness and impact on international peace and security.171
Furthermore, in her opinion in Lounani, Advocate General Sharpston acknowledges that
the “serious reasons to consider” standard requires that a high threshold is used for
invoking exclusion ground (c). The act must have an impact on the international level,
and be of such gravity that it has implications for international peace and security.172
Sharpston denies that a terrorist organisation should have conducted any violent acts of a
particularly cruel nature so that exclusion clause may be applied.173 Therefore, even
though the group had not committed any disproportionate attacks against the civilian
population or any particularly cruel attacks, the gravity threshold for the excludable act
may be satisfied if there are considerable negative effects on international peace and
security. Therefore, even though the UNSC resolutions relating to combating terrorism
cover a wide variety of acts of concern, and the resolutions may even cover all the
different terrorism related activities of the Terrorism Directive, it does not necessarily
mean that all these acts would satisfy the requirements of the application of exclusion
ground (c) in all situations. The mention of these acts or activities in the UNSC resolution
still does not mean that they fulfil the gravity requirement in relation to the application of
exclusion ground (c).
The UNHCR has discussed the seriousness of providing funding to terrorist groups in the
context of exclusion ground (b) and concluded that such activities, even if criminalised,
may not automatically reach the gravity required to fall under exclusion ground (b).
According to the organisation, the particulars of the crime should be considered on a case
by case basis. For example, if the amount of financial support paid is small and if the
funding has occurred on a sporadic basis, the offence may not reach the required level of
seriousness. Conversely, regular contributions of large amounts to a terrorist organisation
may reach the gravity level required for the application of exclusion ground (b).174 The
CJEU has also dealt with funding of terrorism in relation to Article 24(1) of the QD

concerning the revocation of a residence permit in its case H.T. The case concerned Mr.
T. who had, during the act of distributing a periodical published by the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party (hereafter, the PKK), also collected donations on behalf of this listed
terrorist group.175 The CJEU decided that the fact that he committed176 such acts does not
automatically mean that he supported the legitimacy of terrorist activities, and such acts
also do not constitute terrorist acts as such.177 To derive a conclusion from this discussion,
the gravity requirement in relation to exclusion ground (c) may not be easily fulfilled,
particularly in situations involving moderate sums.
In conclusion, the terrorist activity regulated in Articles 5 to 12 of the Terrorism Directive
may be excludable if the act is serious enough to have a grave negative impact on
international peace and security. Therefore, even though the act or activity of the terrorist
group is mentioned in the UNSC resolutions relating to combating terrorism, it must also
be of sufficient gravity to have a negative effect on international peace and security.
3. Individual Responsibility and Membership of a Terrorist Group
3.1

Requirement for Individual Responsibility

In this chapter, the exclusion assessment is discussed on the individual level. For the
exclusion to become applicable, there must be serious reasons to consider that the
applicant is guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN. The threshold
for serious reasons to consider is typically the standard of proof for exclusion. The
standard is the same in the Refugee Convention and the QD. The standard of proof for
exclusion is significantly lower than the standard of proof used in criminal law, beyond
reasonable doubt.178 Therefore, exclusion does not require the determination of guilt in
the criminal justice sense.179 However, the threshold must be high enough to satisfy the
overall humanitarian objective of the Refugee Convention, and that applicants otherwise
eligible for refugee status are not excluded incorrectly.180

175

CJEU, Case C-373/13, H.T, 24 June 2015, paras. 34, 81.
In this case Mr. T. directly committed these acts, and the discussion in relation to funding terrorism did
not consider the acts of the terrorist group.

179
UNHCR Background Note 2003 para. 107.
180
UNHCR Background Note 2003, para. 107. In the view of the UNHCR, at least the standard of proof
required for an indictment of an international criminal tribunal also satisfies the standard of proof for
exclusion.
176

34

The clearest serious reasons to consider standard is relevant as the standard of proof for
the quantity of evidence required to exclude a person otherwise eligible for refugee status.
However, the threshold requires that the evidence is also qualitatively sufficient. It is not
sufficient that the amount of evidence rises above the required level; the evidence must
be serious enough.181 Furthermore, the adduced evidence must be substantively sufficient
in relation to the elements of the crime or act in question. This means that the
quantitatively and qualitatively sufficient evidence also supports the person’s individual
responsibility for the excludable acts.182 A person may have individual responsibility for
an act if they have directly committed the act, or if their conduct satisfies the other forms
of individual responsibility.
As outlined above, the serious reasons to consider threshold as an evidential standard is
much lower than the corresponding standard in criminal law. However, the relaxed
application of the standard of proof only applies to the questions of fact, not law. The
reduced application of fundamental criminal law principles is not justified when assessing
the evidence in relation to exclusion.183 To establish individual responsibility for a crime,
both the material element and the mental element of the crime must be fulfilled.184 This
is a general principle of law.185 Similar to criminal law, when applying the exclusion
clause, for individual responsibility to arise, the applicant must have committed or
substantially contributed to the criminal act in the knowledge that their act or omission
would facilitate the criminal conduct.186 The acts the applicant is found to have committed
must conform with a relevant form of criminal liability. If it is determined that the relevant
form of criminal liability remains contested as a matter of law, it may not satisfy the test
for serious reasons for considering.187 Therefore, in addition to being an evidential

181

Hathaway & Forster 2014, p. 535. See also UNHCR Background Note 2003, para. 108. According to
the UNHCR, the adduced evidence should be clear and credible. For example, an applicant’s confession
may satisfy the test of clear and credible evidence, but the credibility of the confession must be examined,
especially if the confession has been made under coercion in the country of origin.

See generally about the concepts of material and mental elements in Keiler 2013, p. 7. The terminology
varies between different legal systems. In common law systems, the concepts of actus reus and mens rea
are used. Actus reus refers to the material element of a crime, whereas mens rea means the mental element
of a crime. For example, the German criminal jurisprudence is referring to “objektiver und subjektiver
Tatbestand”.

standard, the serious reasons to consider threshold may be regarded as the underlying
principle in the application of the exclusion clause.
Furthermore, the CJEU has acknowledged that the individual responsibility of a member
of a terrorist group must be assessed in light of both objective (actual conduct) and
subjective (awareness and intent) criteria.188 The applicant’s acts should have a
connection to the principal excludable acts of the terrorist organisation, the material
element, and the requirement of the mental element should be fulfilled. In relation to
terrorist activity, the person’s intent and motivation are important factors to consider.189
In addition, if a defence better known in the criminal law context, such as the defence of
duress or superior orders, is applicable, it may be that there are no serious reasons to
consider the applicant as criminally liable and thus exclude them.190
For example, the UNHCR relies on international criminal law when looking for guidance
to determine an applicant’s individual responsibility in the context of the application of
the exclusion clause.191 In relation to the crimes described in exclusion ground (a),
reflecting international crimes in the statutes and jurisprudence of international criminal
tribunals, individual responsibility arises as in these sources of international criminal law.
It may not be possible to refer to such exact regulations of an international source when
determining the forms of individual responsibility in relation to exclusion grounds (b) and
(c).192 However, the wording used in the exclusion clause, such as “commit”, “crime” or
“being guilty”, still suggests that the individual responsibility required from the applicant

intoxication; self-defence; and duress. Also Articles 25(3)(f) (abandonment the effort to commit the crime,
or otherwise preventing of the crime, Article 26 (Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen),

should correspond to a criminal liability.193 However, this does not necessarily mean the
criminal liability established in the sources of international criminal law.
EASO has summarised the national case law of some EU Member States. Based on that
summary, the national case law considering individual responsibility in relation to
exclusion grounds (b) and (c) is inconsistent, and differing methods to establish the
individual responsibility of the applicant have been used. In the UK, the Supreme Court
has determined that the forms of individual criminal liability of Article 25(3)(b–d) of the
Rome Statute may be applicable to the exclusion clause as a whole. Conversely, the
Federal Administrative Court of Germany has considered that the provisions of the Rome
Statute are not applicable to exclusion grounds (b) and (c), and that there are no consistent
international standards to assess individual responsibility in relation to these exclusion
grounds. For example, some national courts in Europe have deemed that the criteria of
national criminal law should be considered.194 In addition, different notions of extended
liability, also without regard to international criminal law, have been developed in an
autonomous fashion at the national and regional levels.195
Therefore, the standard for individual criminal responsibility in relation to Article
12(2)(c) remains unsettled. The following section discusses how EU counter terrorism
law may affect the notions of individual responsibility in the application of exclusion
ground (c) and if and how it conforms to the individual criminal responsibility of
international criminal law. In addition, whether EU law corresponds to the serious reasons
to consider standard is discussed.
3.2

Forms of Individual Responsibility

Originally, the exclusion clause referred to the simplest form of individual responsibility
known in the criminal law context – direct liability.196 Direct liability arises when a person
directly commits a crime. The Refugee Convention does not refer to any other forms of

193

See Li 2017, p. 241. But see EASO Exclusion Judicial Analysis 2016, p. 26. EASO is arguing that since
exclusion ground (c) is referring to acts rather than crimes, the application of this ground may go beyond
the determination of criminal liability.

37

individual responsibility than direct liability that may lead to exclusion. However, it is
generally recognised that other forms of responsibility may also lead to exclusion.197
In the legislative process of the QD other forms of individual responsibility were chosen
to be included in the article considering exclusion. Article 12(3) states that applicants who
incite or otherwise participate in the commission of the crimes or acts listed in Article
12(2) are also excluded from being a refugee. Thus, the individual responsibility for
crimes or acts described in the exclusion clause may arise in three different ways: directly;
inciting others to commit the crime or act; or through participation in the commission of
crimes or acts of others.198 In the QD, incitement is equated with the concept of
participation and thus may be considered as a mode of participation rather than a form of
commission or indirect perpetration of a crime or act.199 The QD does not mention
attempting to commit a crime as a basis for individual responsibility in the application of
the exclusion clause. Attempting is also not determined in the CJEU cases, and therefore
it is not discussed in this thesis.
The CJEU cases, B and D and Lounani, both consider participation as the basis for
individual responsibility in the application of the exclusion clause. In B and D, the CJEU
referred to the forms of participation (instigation and participation in a crime or act in any
other way) stated in Article 12(3) of the QD, and determined that the individual
responsibility for carrying out the excludable acts must be attributed to the person
concerned so that exclusion may become applicable.200 In relation to the members of
terrorist organisations, this determination means that a share of the responsibility for the
acts committed by the organisation using terrorist methods must be attributable to the
member during the relevant time they were a member.201 In B and D, the question was
about participation in the actual terrorist acts.

In Lounani, the CJEU decided that the application of exclusion ground (c) extends to
those who engage in terrorist activities.202 Exclusion ground (c) is applicable to persons
who instigated acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the UN or participated in
such acts. Furthermore, it is not a prerequisite that the person instigated or participated in
any terrorist acts.203 Therefore, for the Lounani case, the CJEU considered participation
in terrorist activities other than the actual terrorist offences.
The possible acts of participation that may connect a member’s acts to the principal
excludable acts of the terrorist organisation and that may establish the individual
responsibility of a member are not determined more comprehensively in the QD or in
CJEU case law. 204 The UNHCR has relied on the forms of participation developed in
international criminal law when considering individual responsibility in relation to the
exclusion clause.205
There are various forms of participation that establish individual responsibility in
international criminal law. The principles for considering criminal liability for
international crimes find expression in the statutes and jurisprudence of international
criminal tribunals or courts: International Criminal Court (hereafter, ICC), ICTY and
ICTR.206 Most importantly, the ICC’s Rome Statute recognises different material
elements of criminal participation through which individual responsibility arises. The
relevant regulation in the Rome Statute is Article 25(3)(a–e):
In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and
liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that
person:
(a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or
through another person, regardless of whether that other person is
criminally responsible;
(b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact
occurs or is attempted;

planning or preparation of terrorist acts”.

(c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids,
abets or otherwise assists in its commission or its attempted commission,
including providing the means for its commission;
(d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted
commission of such a crime by a group of persons acting with a common
purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:
(i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or
criminal purpose of the group, where such activity or purpose
involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of
the Court; or
(ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to
commit the crime;
(e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others
to commit genocide…
Article 25(3)(a) states that individual responsibility may arise in ways other than direct
participation. Article 25(3)(b) refers to ordering, soliciting, or inducing, of which
inducing may be considered the lowest grade of instigation, and thus is broad enough to
cover any type of influence causing another person to commit a crime.207 Article 25(3)(c)
refers to aiding, abetting or otherwise assisting in the commission of a crime. Article
25(3)(d) refers to common purpose responsibility; and Article 25(3)(e) to incitement, but
only in relation to genocide. Article 28 of the Rome Statute also regulates about the
responsibility of commanders and other superiors.208

207

Sliedregt 2012, p. 107.
Article 28 of the Rome Statute reads as following: “In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility
under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court:
(a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally
responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her effective
command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his or her failure
to exercise control properly over such forces, where:
(i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the
time, should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes;
and
(ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures
within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to
the competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.
(b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall
be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates under
his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control properly over
such subordinates, where:
(i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly
indicated, that the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;
(ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control
of the superior; and
208

40

The particulars of the mental element of a crime are also defined in international criminal
law. Article 30 of the Rome Statute defines the general rule of the mental element.209
According to Article 30, a person has individual criminal responsibility only if the
material elements of a crime are committed with intent and knowledge. Article 30 also
defines the relevant concepts in relation to the mental element: a person has intent in
relation to conduct when that person means to engage in the conduct, and in relation to a
consequence, when that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will
occur in the ordinary course of events. Knowledge means awareness that a circumstance
exists, or that a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events.210
The forms of participation developed in international criminal law have been used in
relation to exclusion ground (a) concerning international crimes, and differing views exist
about their applicability to the other exclusion grounds as explained above. Recently, it
was suggested in legal literature that it may be more beneficial to use counter terrorism
regulations on individual liability in the application of the exclusion clause in terrorism
related contexts.211 The CJEU has not directly applied the terrorism related regulations in
the assessment of individual liability, even though it has referred to them in the
determination of the excludable acts. However, in Lounani, the Court recognised that the
applicant’s conviction of a terrorism related crime, and that the conviction had become
final, was of particular importance in the individual assessment related to exclusion.212
Therefore, it appears that the requirements for individual responsibility are satisfied in
the case because the applicant had been considered as criminally liable for certain terrorist
crimes in previous criminal proceedings. Hence, the Court has indirectly used the EU and
national regulations on criminal liability of terrorism related crimes to establish individual
responsibility in the exclusion assessment.

(iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her
power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent
authorities for investigation and prosecution.”
209
There are exceptions from this default rule. For instance, the above-mentioned Article 28 of the Rome
Statute sets lower standards for the mental element of superiors: Commanders and other superiors must
have the mens rea standard amounting to negligence or recklessness.
210
See in relation to mental element in ICTY and ICTR in Sliedregt 2012, pp. 50–51. The founding
documents of ICTY and ICTR do not include the provisions of mental element, however, the mental
elements of specific crimes are defined in the case law of these tribunals. The requirements for the mental
element in the ICTY/ICTR case law partly differ from the default mental element of the ICC.

The forms of complicity establishing extended liability are regulated in Article 14(1–2)213
of the Terrorism Directive. Article 14(1) requires that aiding and abetting in relation to
offences listed in Articles 3 to 8214, 11215 and 12216 are punishable, while Article 14(2)
requires that inciting in relation to Articles 3 to 12217 is also punishable.218 This means
that aiding and abetting or inciting preparatory offences is criminalised similar to aiding
and abetting or inciting the terrorist acts themselves. The extent of such criminalisation
in the directive is thus wider than in the Framework Decision (2002/475).219 However,
the Terrorism Directive appears to comprise fewer modes of individual responsibility in
comparison to the modes of participation in international criminal law.
The special feature of counter terrorism legislation is that many of the criminalised acts
are similar to complicity in terrorist offences, but they are principal crimes in themselves.
In the Framework Decision (2002/475), the distinction between the liability arising from
the direct act of participation in the activities of a terrorist group220 or the offences linked
to terrorist activities221 and the liability arising from complicity222 to the actual terrorist
offences223 is blurred.224 This also appears to be the case in the Terrorism Directive. For
example, Article 6 of the Terrorism Directive covers one of the offences related to
terrorist activities; it considers recruitment for terrorism, and it reads as intentionally
soliciting another person to commit or contribute to the commission of one of the terrorist
offences or to an offence relating to a terrorist group is punishable as a criminal offence
by itself. Soliciting is one of the forms of individual responsibility in the Rome Statute.225
213

Article 14(3) of the Terrorism Directive considers attempting that is not discussed in this thesis as
explained above.
214
Article 3 of the Terrorism Directive considers the actual terrorist offences; Article 4 considers offences
relating to a terrorist group; Article 5 is about public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; Article 6
considers recruitment for terrorism; Article 7 is about providing training for terrorism; and Article 8 is
about receiving training for terrorism.
215
Article 11 of the Terrorism Directive considers terrorist financing.
216
Article 12 of the Terrorism Directive considers other offences related to terrorist activities.
217
Therefore, inciting is possible in relation to all the terrorism related offences. In addition to the offences
mentioned in relation to aiding and abetting, incitement is thus also possible in relation Article 9 concerning
travelling for the purpose of terrorism; and Article 10 concerning organising or otherwise facilitating
travelling for the purpose of terrorism.
218
This article also criminalizes attempting but that is outlined from this thesis.

Correspondingly, Article 7 considering providing training for terrorism requires the
criminalisation of “providing instruction on the making or use of explosives, firearms or
other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, or on other specific methods or
techniques, for the purpose of committing, or contributing to the commission of” one of
the actual terrorist offences.226 Therefore, in some cases the act of providing training for
terrorism may also fulfil the requirements for material and mental elements of aiding and
abetting the actual terrorist offences.
Furthermore, Article 4 of the Terrorism Directive considering offences relating to a
terrorist group is a participation crime that may be easily mixed with the other forms of
individual responsibility. Article 4 is twofold. The first part considers intentionally
directing a terrorist group, while the second part considers intentionally “participating in
the activities of a terrorist group, including by supplying information or material
resources, or by funding its activities in any way, with knowledge of the fact that such
participation will contribute to the criminal activities of the terrorist group”. The first part
of the article is clearly seen as a representation of the superior responsibility of
international criminal law. In addition, similarities with ordering, as regulated in Article
25(3)(b) of the Rome Statute, can be seen. According to Lehto, when the second part of
the article considering participation in the activities of a terrorist group is read together
with the definition of a terrorist group,227 it is similar to the common purpose mode of
participation regulated in the Rome Statute. However, the common purpose offence in
international criminal law is only punishable when a substantive crime occurs. 228 This is
not required of the offences relating to a terrorist group in the Terrorism Directive. This
is also a feature of the participation crimes in the Terrorism Directive in that for them to
become punishable they do not require that an actual terrorist offence is committed.229
Therefore, even though EU counter terrorism legislation appears to contain less forms of
participation than international criminal law, this is not the case. Some offences that may

226

The act needs to be also intentional and committed knowingly that the skills provided are intended to be
used for the required purpose.
227
In the Framework Decision (2002/475), the definition of a terrorist group was situated in the same article
as the crime of participation in the activities of such a group. In the Terrorism Directive, the definition of a
terrorist group has been moved to Article 2 that comprises also other relevant definitions.
228
Lehto 2008, p. 403.

Article 13 of the Terrorism Directive states that for the offences relating to a terrorist group or the
offences related to terrorist activities to become punishable, it is not necessary that a terrorist offence be
actually committed.

43

correspond, to some extent, to the forms of complicity in international criminal law
become punishable as independent criminal offences in the Terrorism Directive.
Furthermore, criminal procedural law in the field of counter terrorism often extends
further into the preparative phase than “normal” criminal procedural law.230 Therefore,
counter terrorism regulations may contain additional forms of individual responsibility
that go further to the preparative stage, and that may not be found in international criminal
law.
However, because of the page count limitations of this thesis, the offences related to
terrorist activities are not discussed in more detail in the context of participation crimes.
In the following sub-sections, the forms of complicity in the Terrorism Directive, aiding
and abetting or incitement, are discussed in more detail. They are compared to the
corresponding forms of individual responsibility in international criminal law. In
addition, participation in the activities of a terrorist group, as determined in Article 4(b)
of the Terrorism Directive, is discussed as a participation crime.
3.3

Participation through Aiding and Abetting or Inciting Terrorism

Exclusion ground (c) is applicable to persons who instigated acts contrary to the purposes
and principles of the UN, or participated in such acts.231 If the Terrorism Directive is used
for the interpretation of the concepts of participation and instigation in terrorism related
activity, it would mean that the possible forms of participation are aiding and abetting
and inciting as regulated in Article 14(1–2). According to the CJEU, individual
responsibility must be assessed in light of both objective and subjective criteria.232
Therefore, in this section the material and mental elements of aiding and abetting and
inciting in counter terrorism law and international criminal law are discussed, considering
the context of exclusion ground (c).
The UNHCR has widely relied on the criteria developed in international criminal
jurisprudence in the application of the exclusion clause. It has referred to the ICTY’s
Kvocka et al. case in which participation in a crime is discussed under four headings:
instigation; commission; aiding and abetting; and participation in a joint criminal

enterprise.233 According to the ICTY’s determination in the case, aiding and abetting may
be an act or omission and may take place before, during or after the commission of a
crime. The act or omission must substantially contribute to the commission of a crime;
however, causal connection between the conduct and the commission of a crime is not
required.234
According to the European Commission’s Proposal for the Terrorism Directive, the
material element of aiding and abetting in the Terrorism Directive is sufficiently wide
and may contain different kinds of activities.235 In relation to aiding and abetting a
terrorist offence, these may include providing financial resources for the execution of a
terrorist attack or providing supportive services or material (for example transportation,
weapons, explosives, or shelter).236 In the European Commission’s proposal, aiding and
abetting is described more as an active way to assist in the commission of the principal
offence, while in international criminal law omission or failure to act may sometimes be
regarded as aiding and abetting.237 However, it may not have been the intention of the
legislator to exclude the omission liability because the Terrorism Directive does not
comprehensively define the material element of aiding and abetting. Instead, the
Terrorism Directive leaves the States to apply their existing provisions of national penal
laws on aiding and abetting.238 However, in the context of the application of the exclusion
clause, referring to international criminal law for the application of the material element
of aiding and abetting may also be justified.
A member of a terrorist group must also have had the requisite mental element to
participate in the particular terrorism related act so that their conduct may be regarded as
aiding and abetting. The mental element is a fundamental aspect of the criminal offence
and if it is missing, the individual responsibility for the crimes or acts is not fulfilled.239

In the Rome Statute, the mental element of aiding and abetting is purpose based: the aider
and abettor commits their acts for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a certain
crime described in the statute. In ICTY and ICTR case law, the required mental element
for aiding and abetting is knowledge based. The aider and abettor must have knowledge
that their conduct assists in the commission of the specific crime of the principal
perpetrator. The aider and abettor must have knowledge of the essential elements of the
crime. In relation to crimes with a specific intent, such as the crime of persecution, the
aider and abettor must also have knowledge of the discriminatory context of the crime.240
The mental element of aiding and abetting in the context of EU counter terrorism law
may be derived from Recital 15 of the Terrorism Directive:
The provision of material support for terrorism through persons engaging
in or acting as intermediaries in the supply or movement of services, assets
and goods, including trade transactions involving the entry into or exit from
the Union, such as the sale, acquisition or exchange of a cultural object of
archaeological, artistic, historical or scientific interest illegally removed
from an area controlled by a terrorist group at the time of the removal,
should be punishable, in the Member States, as aiding and abetting terrorism
or as terrorist financing if performed with the knowledge that these
operations or the proceeds thereof are intended to be used, in full or in
part, for the purpose of terrorism or will benefit terrorist groups
(emphasis added).
Therefore, the mental element of aiding and abetting in the Terrorism Directive is similar
to the knowledge based mental element of the ICTY and ICTR. In addition, in B and D
the CJEU required that, in the individual assessment, the competent authority must
examine, inter alia, the extent of the knowledge the member had or was deemed to have
of the activities of the terrorist group.241 However, in the Terrorism Directive, the
knowledge requirement is expressed in more detail than in the CJEU’s case. The aider
and abettor must have knowledge of the circumstance that the group they are supporting
is, in fact, a terrorist group. In addition, the aider and abettor must have knowledge about
the consequence that their acts benefit the group, or the purposes of terrorism in general.

46

However, it appears that it is not required that the conduct of the aider and abettor has a
causal effect on those consequences. Furthermore, the aider and abettor may not have to
know about the principal terrorist crimes of the group. In relation to terrorist financing,
Lehto argues that it may be presumed that a person has intended to finance terrorist
activities in a case in which funds have been transferred to a proscribed terrorist group.242
Similarly, the knowledge requirement of the aider and abettor may be presumed in a case
in which the person is acting for the benefit of a listed terrorist group.243
Incitement in the context of the exclusion clause is closer to the concept of “instigation”
than the “incitement to genocide” of international criminal law. The UNHCR has referred
to international criminal law when defining the concept of instigation in the application
of the exclusion clause.244 It has referred to ICTY’s judgment in Kvocka et al., in which
the Tribunal determined that the actus reus of instigating requires that a person prompts
another person to act in a particular way. The required mens rea is that the person intended
to provoke or induce the commission of the crime or was aware of the substantial
likelihood that the commission of a crime would be a probable consequence of his acts.245
Therefore, the instigator puts an idea about a crime to someone’s mind but does not
participate in the actual commission of the crime. It is the latter person who decides
whether and how to commit the act.246
The Terrorism Directive contains incitement in two separate articles. Article 5
considering public provocation to commit a terrorist offence contains incitement as a
material element of the crime itself.247 Article 14(2) contains incitement as a mode of
participation in the terrorism related crimes. According to the European Commission’s
Proposal for the Terrorism Directive, the inciter is often the driving force behind the

See also Sivakumaran 2014, p. 361. Sivakumaran notices that it may difficult or impossible for a
suspected member of a terrorist group to prove that they lacked knowledge, or was not involved with such
a group, and therefore, any presumptions of exclusion are not justified.

Article 5 of the Terrorism Directive reads as following: ”Member States shall take the necessary
measures to ensure that the distribution, or otherwise making available by any means, whether online or
offline, of a message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of one of the offences listed in
points (a) to (i) of Article 3(1), where such conduct, directly or indirectly, such as by the glorification of
terrorist acts, advocates the commission of terrorist offences, thereby causing a danger that one or more
such offences may be committed, is punishable as a criminal offence when committed intentionally.”

actions taken by a direct offender.248 The Terrorism Directive does not further determine
the concept of incitement.
3.4

Participation in the Activities of a Terrorist Group

In the Lounani case, the CJEU determined that the acts constituting participation in the
activities of a terrorist group, such as those which Lounani was convicted of by the
Belgian court, may justify exclusion.249 Lounani was convicted of, among other crimes,
participation in the activities of a terrorist group as a member of its leadership. The
Criminal Court, Brussels, found that Lounani had provided logistical support to a terrorist
group by providing, inter alia, material resources or information; engaging in forgery and
fraudulent transfer of passports; and participating actively in the organisation of a network
for sending volunteers to Iraq. The fraudulent transfer of passports was described as an
act of participation in the activities of a cell providing logistical support to a terrorist
movement.250 The CJEU determined that for exclusion ground (c) to become applicable,
it is not required that the asylum applicant directly committed or instigated terrorist
offences or otherwise participated in such offences.251 The CJEU held that in the
individual assessment it is of particular importance, inter alia, that the asylum applicant
was convicted of participation in the activities of a terrorist group. 252
In the EU counter terrorism legislation, participation in the activities of a terrorist group
is currently regulated in the second part of Article 4 of the Terrorism Directive
considering offences relating to a terrorist group. It criminalises the intentional act of
participation in the activities of a terrorist group. Lounani’s conviction for participation
in the activities of a terrorist group corresponds to Article 4(b) of the Terrorism Directive.
Article 4(b) of the Terrorism Directive appears as complicity but in fact it is punishable
as a criminal offence by itself. 253 Therefore, some acts that are under the umbrella of
Article 4(b) may also be close to fulfilling the requirements for aiding and abetting a

terrorist offence.254 However, punishing the aider and abettor would require that the
principal crime is committed or at least attempted. In participation offences, this is not
required.255 In addition, in participation crimes the conduct of the individual is further
from the actual terrorist offence than aiding and abetting such an offence.256
Article 4(b) of the Terrorism Directive regulates the lowest form of a punishable crime
for members of terrorist groups. However, the reading of the offence does not require that
Member States criminalise membership of a terrorist group as such.257 Therefore, the
member must participate in the activities of a terrorist group actively so that the
participation may become punishable. The article provides a few examples of such active
participation: supplying information or material resources, or in any way funding the
activities of a terrorist group. For example, in the Finnish Government Bill, supporting
the group by participating in its meetings or supporting it with an expression of opinion
has been excluded from punishable behaviour.258 The requirement of active participation
corresponds to the determination of the CJEU that mere membership is not accepted as
the basis for individual responsibility of a member of a terrorist organisation in the context
of the exclusion clause.259

254

See Lehto, p. 406. Lehto is pointing out that some scholars seem to consider that this participation crime
is only a little more than complicity, conduct that is already covered by most national penal codes.
255
Lohse, 2011, p. 15; Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of
Terrorism 2005, para. 78. Participation crimes are criminal offences of a serious nature related to terrorist
offences as they have the potential to lead to the commission of such offences.
256
See Lohse pp. 14–17. Lohse has compared the participation crimes to aiding and abetting in the Finnish
Criminal Code. The terrorist crimes in the Finnish Criminal Code were based, at the time of his writing, to
the Framework Decision (2002/475). See also Hallituksen esitys Eduskunnalle terrorismia koskeviksi
rikoslain ja pakkokeinolain säännöksiksi 2002, s. 55.
257
See Heikkilä 2002, p. 56. Heikkilä explains that the individual responsibility does not arise in
international criminal law on the basis of mere membership. The collective criminality has been rejected
because of human rights concerns: the presumption of innocence requires that guilt is never presumed.
However, the sole membership of a terrorist group is criminalized in some national jurisdictions. For
example, Section 11 of the UK Terrorism Act creates the offence of membership to a proscribed
organisation. The Act clearly bases the criminality of a person to the proscription of the organisation to
which the person is a member: It sets that a defence for a person charged with the membership offence is
that the person must prove that the organisation was not proscribed when they became its member or that
they have not taken part in the activities of the organisation at any time while it was proscribed. See Walker
2011, paras. 8.39–8.48.

UNHCR Background Note 2003, para. 60. The UNHCR previously recognized that in some rare cases
exclusion based on mere membership may be possible. That would require that the membership is
voluntary, and the activities of the group involve especially severe crimes such as indiscriminate killings
or torture.

49

In Lounani, the CJEU did not assess the mental element of the asylum applicant.
However, this does not mean that consideration of the mental element was not relevant
in the determination of Lounani’s individual responsibility. Instead, the Court held that
Lounani’s conviction for participation in the activities of a terrorist group and that the
conviction had become final have particular importance in the individual assessment in
the application of the exclusion clause.260 Therefore, it appears that in Lounani the mental
element of the crime had already been considered in the criminal process by the national
criminal court. Thus, consideration of the mental element in the criminal process in
relation to the crime of participation in the activities of a terrorist group also satisfy the
required mental element in the exclusion assessment.
Article 4(b) has dual requirements for the mental element. Firstly, the act of participation
must be intentional. Secondly, knowledge in relation to a circumstance that the
participation will contribute to the criminal activities of the terrorist group is required.
The knowledge requirement of Article 4(b) defines the limits of the activities that may be
considered as criminal under the article. For example, it would be difficult to imagine that
the direct support of non-terrorist conduct of a terrorist group, such as cooking meals or
providing other goods or services not directly linked with violent terrorist acts, could be
considered to be covered by the article.261
According to the interpretation of some scholars, the article only requires knowledge of
the broader non-terrorist criminal activities of the group.262 When the article is read
literally, it does not require that the person participating in the activities of a terrorist
group had knowledge of the group’s terrorist activities. However, in the context of
exclusion ground (c), it seems reasonable to require that the member was at least aware
of the terrorist nature of the group. The purpose of exclusion ground (c) is to cover acts
considered against the purposes and principles of the UN. As terrorism has been
considered as such an act, it would be difficult to imagine that exclusion would become

point is that the participation forwards the terrorism related criminal activity of the group.

applicable in a situation in which the person is not aware of the fact that the group engages
in terrorist activities.263
A participant’s knowledge of the terrorism context is also recognised in the application
of the exclusion clause. In her opinion on Lounani, Advocate General Sharpston
commented that a participant shares responsibility for the terrorist activities of a group in
the case where the person had the knowledge that they were facilitating the commission
of terrorist activities.264 Therefore, a person’s motives and intentions in relation to the
terrorist group in which they were a participant are also relevant to establishing their
personal responsibility.265 Moreover, the CJEU’s H.T. case supports this determination
even though the case did not directly consider the exclusion clause. In the H.T. case, Mr.
T. had participated in the legal meetings of the PKK, collected donations for the group,
and occasionally distributed the group’s periodical. Mr. T.’s funding of the group was
general and not funding for committing terrorist acts. The CJEU ruled that such acts in
themselves do not constitute terrorist acts, and that it does not necessarily follow from
those acts that Mr. T. supported the legitimacy of terrorist activities. 266 Therefore,
knowledge about supporting or furthering the terrorist activities in general is required
without them being linked to a specific terrorist offence.
In conclusion, participation in the activities of a terrorist group may be an excludable act
under exclusion ground (c). In the Terrorism Directive, a participation crime may not
fully correspond to the excludable participation act that is required in the application of
exclusion ground (c).
3.5

Seriousness of Participation

Participation in the activities of a terrorist group; aiding and abetting and inciting
terrorism related activity can cover a wide range of conduct of varying degrees of

263

However, theoretically the mental element of a member of a terrorist group could be fulfilled in the
exclusion context in such situations in which the criminal activities of the group included also other
excludable acts, and the member actively participating in the group’s activities was aware of them but not
of the terrorist nature of the group.

seriousness.267 The most serious of such acts may be participation in the commission of
actual terrorist acts. However, the Terrorism Directive also enables punishment for chainparticipation when it makes the punishment for participation in the participation crimes
possible. For example, aiding and abetting or inciting participation in the activities of a
terrorist group is also punishable.268
Therefore, not all participation acts listed in the Terrorism Directive come under the
auspices of exclusion ground (c). The asylum law sets additional requirements on what
kind of participation may be regarded as serious enough to justify exclusion. The UNHCR
has stated that for individual responsibility to arise in the exclusion assessment, the
applicant must have made a substantial contribution to the criminal act.269 In the national
case law of some Member States, substantial or significant contribution or support to the
main crime is required.270 In her opinion in Lounani, Advocate General Sharpston
commented that for individual responsibility to arise, a person should have made a
substantial contribution to the terrorist activities of a group.271 Consequently,
participation also has a certain level of gravity requirement. Therefore, in relation to
members of terrorist groups that substantially contribute to an excludable activity, there
may be serious reasons to consider that the member participated in acts against the
purposes and principles of the UN.
To assess whether the member has made a substantial contribution to the terrorist
activities of the group, the person’s position within the organisation and their ability to
influence the group’s activities should be assessed. The true role played by the person in
the commission of the excludable acts must be assessed. In addition, whether and to what
extent the person was involved in planning, decision-making, or directing other persons
with a view of committing terrorist acts, and whether and to what extent they financed

such acts or provided the means for other persons to commit them must be examined.272
In relation to the Lounani case, Advocate General Sharpston analysed Lounani’s situation
on the above demonstrated grounds. She concluded that because Lounani was a leading
member of the terrorist group, it follows logically that he could presumably influence the
group’s activities. Because of his logistical support to the group, he facilitated and
enabled others to participate in or commit terrorist acts.273
In its exclusion assessment in both exclusion related cases, the CJEU highlighted the
applicants’ leadership role in a terrorist organisation. In B and D, the Court determined
that the individual responsibility of a terrorist group’s leader for acts committed by that
organisation during the relevant period can be presumed.274 In in its analysis of Lounani,
the CJEU maintained the importance of the fact that Lounani had participated in the
activities of a terrorist group and the fact that he had been a member of the group’s
leadership, even though he had not been convicted for directing a terrorist group. Both
facts were given particular importance in the Court’s exclusion assessment, which led to
the conclusion that Lounani’s acts were considered to fall under Articles 12(2)(c) and
12(3).275
Originally, the UNHCR’s position was that acts under exclusion ground (c) could only
be committed by persons holding high positions in a state or state-like entity because the
UN’s purposes and principles are intended to be a guide for states in their relations with
each other.276 In the past, this was also the general view among commentators.277
However, neither conditions, the position as a state official, nor senior status, are absolute
requirements for the application of exclusion ground (c).278 However, it appears that the
closer a person is to a leadership position rather than an ordinary member, the more likely

all the relevant circumstances before making a decision on exclusion.

a conclusion may be drawn that the person knew of the terrorist activities.279 The same
applies to a leader’s ability to substantially contribute to the group’s activities compared
to an ordinary member’s ability.280 According to some commentators the scope of
application of exclusion ground (c) should be limited to acts bearing a certain element of
“policy-making”, meaning that the perpetrator or the participant to such acts usually
occupies a higher position within any organizational structure.281
Therefore, a cautious conclusion could be that the contribution of a leader of a terrorist
group may be regarded as substantial enough to fulfil the gravity threshold for
participation. However, other kinds of participation may be serious enough to be regarded
under the umbrella of exclusion ground (c).
4. Conclusions
Members of terrorist groups may have committed, directly or through participation in the
acts of the group, many different excludable crimes. In situations in which the member
has not directly committed any excludable acts, the exclusion is assessed on collective
and individual levels. On the collective level, the terrorist nature of the group and the acts
and activity of the group are analysed. In the context of EU asylum law, the terrorist
nature of a group is established in situations in which the group has been added to the UN
or EU lists of terrorist groups. The requirement for the international character of such a
group is also fulfilled through listing. Therefore, such lists have a significant effect on the
application of exclusion ground (c) in the European context. However, the exclusion is
not justified if it is only based on the determination of the terrorist nature of the group of
which the asylum applicant was a member.
Terrorist acts or activity that may be considered as against the purposes and principles of
the UN are reflected in the UNSC resolutions relating to terrorism. However, the

279

See Federal Court of Canada, Sivakumar, 4 November 1993. The Federal Court of Canada stated that
“[t]he case for an individual's complicity in international crimes committed by his organization is stronger
if the member holds a position of importance within the organization. The closer one is to a position of
leadership or command within an organization, the easier it will be to draw an inference of awareness of
the crimes and participation in the plan to commit them. And remaining in a leadership position with the
knowledge that the organization was responsible for crimes against humanity may constitute complicity.”
See also UNHCR Observations on the European Commission Proposal 2001, para. 3. According to the
UNHCR, in some cases the personal knowledge and responsibility of the asylum applicant may be
established on the ground of the person’s position.

resolutions do not clearly define the terrorism related concepts. The Terrorism Directive
defines such acts more comprehensively and systematically in the articles concerning
terrorist offences or offences related to terrorist activity. In addition, acts or activities
criminalised in the Terrorism Directive may also be found in some form in the UNSC
resolutions related to terrorism. However, even if an act is found in the UNSC resolution,
it does not necessarily mean that the act fulfils the gravity requirement of exclusion
ground (c). The Refugee law sets additional limits to the interpretation of what kind of
acts may be regarded as excludable acts under exclusion ground (c).
The gravity threshold may be fulfilled when the terrorist group is using indiscriminate
violence or violence against civilians. In addition, the gravity requirement may be
satisfied even without proof of such a violence when the acts of the group, such as
assisting foreign terrorist fighters, have serious implications for international peace and
security. Therefore, not all the actions criminalised in the Terrorism Directive conform to
these standards of gravity. The article of the Terrorism Directive that criminalises acts
and activities related to terrorism are useful interpretation tools when determining the
concept of a terrorist act or terrorist activity in the exclusion assessment under article
12(2)(c) of the QD. However, in the final decision on exclusion the gravity of the act or
activity must also be considered.
On the individual level, a terrorist group member’s individual responsibility for the
excludable acts is analysed. In the Terrorism Directive, only aiding and abetting or
inciting are mentioned as forms of participation. However, the special feature of counter
terrorism regulations is that some of the offences imply complicity, but they are principal
acts in themselves. Therefore, other forms of participation similar to international
criminal law become applicable through participation crimes. However, some
participation crimes go even further than the forms of individual responsibility in
international criminal law. In participation crimes, the terrorist act is not required for the
commission or the attempt of the principal crime, as it is required when applying the rules
of participation of international criminal law.
EU counter terrorism law does not completely define the concepts of aiding and abetting
or incitement. Thus, when applying these concepts, guidance still needs to be taken from
international criminal law or national penal codes. However, the Terrorism Directive has
more substance in relation to aiding and abetting than inciting. The Terrorism Directive
55

is still the most relevant as a guidance for the interpretation of participation crimes, and
especially the offence of participation in the activities of a terrorist group. In its Lounani
case, the CJEU accepted that such participation may be regarded as a form of individual
responsibility in the meaning of the exclusion clause. Participation in the activities of a
terrorist group may be considered as the lowest form of individual responsibility.
However, the participation must still reach the level of active participation. In addition,
the active participant must act in the knowledge that they are facilitating the commission
of terrorist activities.
Furthermore, the exclusion assessment on the individual level contains a gravity
requirement originating from international refugee law. The gravity requirement for
participation is the substantial contribution to the terrorist activities of the terrorist group.
A conclusion may be derived from CJEU case law that the requirement of substantial
contribution of members of terrorist groups is the most clearly fulfilled in the case of
leaders of such groups. The closer the person is to the leadership level of such groups, the
more likely a conclusion may be drawn that the person knew of the group’s activities and
could substantially contribute to those activities.
The application of exclusion ground (c) is somewhat ambiguous. Some commentators
have reasoned that it should be applied similarly to the other exclusion grounds, and that
the rules established in international criminal law should also be applied to this exclusion
ground. Other commentators have concluded that international criminal law is not
applicable to exclusion ground (c), but they have not suggested other substitutes that
could help with its interpretation and that could be widely accepted. In addition, states
have also applied exclusion ground (c) on diverging standards. Therefore, the application
of exclusion ground (c) has not been consistent globally, and not even in the EU member
states. Using the EU counter terrorism law for the interpretation of exclusion ground (c)
in relation to members of terrorist groups would have an important function in
harmonising the application of exclusion ground (c) in the EU member states. However,
the counter terrorism regulations do not fully cover all the aspects of the exclusion
assessment. For some parts of the assessment, especially in relation to assessing
individual responsibility, reference to international criminal law or to regulations of
national penal codes may still be required. Furthermore, the Refugee Convention creates

56

limits for the dynamic interpretation of exclusion ground (c) in cases of members of
terrorist groups.
Together, assessments of the collective and individual levels constitute the exclusion
assessment. Therefore, further research is needed about how the results on both levels are
balanced against each other. The question is whether the gravity level of a terrorist
group’s acts affect the level of contribution that is required from the member to justify
exclusion. The same question is also relevant in reverse: if the asylum applicant is a
leading member of a terrorist group, the question is whether less serious acts of the
terrorist group may cause the exclusion clause to become applicable to that member.
