ABSTRAKT
Klimat- och utsläppsmålen blir allt strängare världen över, och för att nå dessa ökar
andelen förnybar energi i den totala energiproduktionen. Det är en utmaning att få
utbudet av energi att möta efterfrågan på grund av att de flesta förnybara energikällor
är intermittenta till sin natur. Den överskottsenergi som produceras då efterfrågan är
låg behöver lagras för att kunna tillföras i ett senare skede då det finns efterfrågan på
den. Fasändringsmaterial kan användas för att effektivt lagra och tillföra latent termisk
energi vid nästan konstant temperatur.
Målet med detta arbete var att skapa en demomiljö kring fasändringsmaterial som kan
användas inom forskning och utbildning. För fasändringsmaterial är termofysiska
egenskaper som latent värme och specifik värmekapacitet centrala, dessa uppger hur
mycket energi materialen lagrar. En demomiljö byggdes upp baserat på Temperature
history-metoden, T-history, som kan användas för att fastställa de termofysiska
egenskaperna hos fasändringsmaterial. T-history-metoden är enkel och förmånlig och
passar för att användas i undervisningssyfte i labbmiljö. Metoden går ut på att prov på
fasändringsmaterial och en referens värms upp och kyls ner i provrör medan
temperaturen på proverna och referensen mäts. Metoden testades på fem olika
fasändringsmaterial. Fyra av dessa var olika typer av salthydrater som är oorganiska
fasändringsmaterial. Det femte var paraffinvax, som är ett organiskt
fasändringsmaterial.
Undersökningen av de fem olika fasändringsmaterialen med hjälp av T-history
metoden fungerade inte optimalt enligt tidigare anvisningar från litteraturen. Värdena
för den latenta värmen, specifika värmekapaciteten och totala entalpin hos parallella
prov varierade rätt mycket, vilket gav förhöjda standardavvikelser. Vissa av värdena
för de termofysiska egenskaperna stämde överens med litteraturvärden och vissa
skiljde sig. Men även i litteraturen finns det olika värden för egenskaperna hos många
fasändringsmaterial. Det kan bero på att olika metoder används och att det inte finns
standarder för att mäta termofysiska egenskaper i fasändringsmaterial.
En orsak till att metoden inte fungerade optimalt kan vara att den konvektiva
värmeöverföringskoefficienten var för hög. En annan utmaning var att salthydraterna
underkyldes och att temperaturfördelningen inte var likformig. I framtiden kunde man
försöka få bättre resultat genom att använda en klimatkammare för att styra
temperaturen, vilket är vanligt i många färska studier som använt T-history-metoden.
Dessutom kunde man försöka ändra fasändringsmaterialens egenskaper genom att
lägga till olika tillsatsämnen för att skapa livskraftigare alternativ till energilagring.

ABSTRACT
In order to meet the stricter climate and emissions targets that are being set around the
world, the share of renewable energy sources in the energy production mix is being
increased. The intermittent nature of most renewable energy sources poses a challenge
for matching energy supply with energy demand. Energy storage is needed to store
excess energy produced by the renewable energy sources when demand is low, and
supply the energy at a later time when there is demand for it. Latent heat thermal
energy storage using phase change materials is an efficient method for storing and
releasing energy at almost constant temperature.
The aim of this work was to create a demo environment on phase change materials that
can be used in research and education. The thermophysical properties of phase change
materials, such as the latent heat and the specific heat capacities, are central properties
describing the amount of energy stored by the materials. A demo environment was
built up based on the Temperature history (T-history) method, which can be used to
determine the thermophyiscal properties of phase change materials. The T-history
method is simple and affordable, and it is suitable to be used for educational purposes
in a lab environment. Samples of phase change materials and a reference are heated up
and cooled down in test tubes while the temperature of the samples and reference are
measured. The method was tested on five different phase change materials. Four of
these were different types of salt hydrates, which are inorganic phase change materials,
and one was paraffin wax, which is an organic phase change material.
The investigation of the five different phase change materials using the T-history
method showed that the method did not function optimally according to instructions
from literature. The values for the latent heat, the specific heat capacity and the total
enthalpy of parallel samples had a rather large variation, which resulted in high
standard deviations. Some of the thermophysical properties measured were consistent
with literature values, while some differed. However, also the literature values for
many properties of phase change materials tend to vary. The use of different methods
and the lack of standards for determining the thermophysical properties of phase
change materials may be the cause of this.
One reason that the method did not function optimally can be that the convective heat
transfer coefficient was too high. Another challenge was the supercooling property of
the salt hydrates and that the temperature distribution was not uniform. Future studies
could try to achieve better results by using a climate chamber for controlling the
temperature, which is common in many recent studies that use the T-history method.
Also, further studies could look at modifying the phase change materials by using
various additives to adjust the properties of the materials and make them more viable
options for energy storage.
Key words: Phase change material, thermal energy storage, latent heat

INTRODUCTION

According to a scenario presented by the International Energy Agency, worldwide
energy demand will grow by more than 25% by 2040. The reason for this rise in energy
demand is due to economic and population growth (IEA, 2018). However, the Paris
Agreement, which entered into force on 4 November 2016 and is currently ratified by
187 and signed by 197 countries, aims to keep the global temperature rise well below
2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase
to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC, 2019a; UNFCCC, 2019b). This
presents the global energy system with a dual challenge: there is a need for more
energy and less carbon. On the demand-side, improvements in energy efficiency can
help to solve this challenge (BP, 2019). On the supply-side, a larger share of energy
has to come from renewable energy sources in order to decrease the carbon footprint.
However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources poses a problem in
matching the supply and the demand of energy. Energy from renewable energy sources
such as solar and wind is only generated when there is a sufficient amount of solar
insolation or wind. Thus, energy storage is needed in order to enable the use of a larger
share of renewable energy (Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019). There are various types of
technologies for energy storage, including mechanical energy storage, electrochemical
energy storage, electrical energy storage, chemical energy storage and thermal energy
storage (TES) (Gallo, et al., 2016). TES is of interest for the efficient use of both
renewable energy sources and conventional fuels, for example, solar systems,
combined heat and power systems, waste-to-energy systems and industrial waste heat
recovery (IWH) technologies. Latent heat is one type of thermal energy, and materials
that utilize latent heat to store energy are known as phase change materials (PCMs).
Latent heat is released/stored when the PCMs undergo phase change. The amount of
research on thermal energy storage using PCMs is rapidly growing (Elias &
Stathopoulos, 2019).
The practical part of this thesis was done as a part of a collaboration project on energy
storage between Åbo Akademi University, Novia University of Applied Sciences and
Vaasa University of Applied Sciences. One of the main aims in this project is to create
a demo environment for energy storage that can be used for competence building. The
need for competence building is driven by the increasing need of energy storage but
also the presence of the Energy Cluster in the Vaasa region. The demo environment
should enable competence building for students, teachers, research personnel and
companies.
Due to the growing research interest and potential applications of PCMs, it was
decided that one part of the demo environment should involve PCMs. A literature
review was conducted on the properties and applications of PCMs in order to find ideas
for what the demo-environment could be made up of. After the literature review,

2

practical work on creating a demo environment was conducted. The T-history method
for characterizing the thermophysical properties such as latent heat, sensible heat,
melting temperature and the degree of supercooling of PCMs was chosen as the demo
environment. A T-history method setup was built and tested at the Technobotnia
research and development laboratory.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Thermal Energy Storage (TES)

Thermal energy is widely available, for example as solar energy from the sun, and it
is often a by-product in many energy conversion applications. TES is a way to save
excess thermal energy (heat or cold) in order to use it at a later point in time when
there is demand for it, thus improving the energy efficiency. TES can aid in making
energy demand and supply match over time. There are three steps in a TES storage
system: charging, storage and discharging of energy. TES systems can store sensible,
latent or thermochemical heat, or a mix of these. There are two types of storage
concepts for storage systems: active storage and passive storage. In an active storage
system, heat is transferred by forced convection into the storage material. The storage
material circulates through a heat exchanger, a steam generator or a solar receiver.
Active storage systems can be further divided into direct and indirect systems. In a
direct system, the heat transfer fluid (HTF) also serves as the storage medium. In an
indirect system, a second medium is used for heat storage (Zhang, et al., 2019). In a
passive system, no mechanical equipment is used. Instead, the thermal energy
interactions between the heat source and the system in a passive system rely on natural
convection or buoyancy forces (caused by the density gradient) (Kalaiselvam &
Parameshwaran, 2014).
The following characteristics can be used to describe an energy storage system in
general (IRENA, 2013):

Capacity: This is the amount of energy stored in a system, which depends on the size
of the system, the storage process and the medium.
Power: This is the rate at which the system’s stored energy can be discharged (and
charged).
Charge and discharge time: This is the time needed to charge/discharge the energy
system.
Cost: The cost is expressed either in terms of capacity (€/kWh) or power (€/kW) of
the storage system. The cost depends on the lifetime (number of cycles) of the storage
equipment, and on its capital and operational costs.
Efficiency: The ratio of energy supplied to the user and the energy needed to charge
the storage system. The energy loss during the storage period and the
charging/discharging cycle are accounted for.
Storage period: The time period for which energy is stored (hours, days, weeks and

4

months for seasonal storage).

The most significant design criteria for a TES system are the maximum load needed,
the strategy for operation, the nominal temperature, the enthalpy drop and the
integration into the whole application system. There are a number of requirements for
designing a TES. The TES should have a storage material with high energy density,
the storage material should be compatible with the material of the container, and there
should be adequate heat transfer between the heat transfer fluid and the storage
material. Moreover, the material should have complete reversibility for a number of
cycles, with low thermal losses and easy control (Cabeza, et al., 2015).
There are several benefits that may arise from incorporating energy storage into an
energy system. The economics of the energy system might improve, reducing capital
and operational costs. The energy efficiency, system performance and reliability can
be improved, while pollution and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) can be reduced
(Cabeza, et al., 2015).
There are three different types of thermal energy storage: sensible heat storage, latent
heat storage and thermochemical storage. The concepts of these are presented in Figure
1 (a). For sensible heat storage, heat is derived by applying a temperature gradient to
an energy storage material. For latent heat storage, heat can be stored at constant
temperature owing to the latent heat stored when a material changes phases, as seen in
the straight horizontal line in Figure 1 (b). For thermochemical reactions, heat is stored
by applying heat, Q, to a thermochemical material (the red and black blocks in Figure
1 (c)). The materials separate and can be stored until the system is to be discharged. In
the discharging step, the two reaction products are mixed together at suitable pressure
and temperature conditions, and the heat, Q, is released (de Gracia & Cabeza, 2015).

2.1.1 Sensible thermal (heat) storage
Sensible heat is stored by increasing or decreasing the temperature of a material. The
material can be a solid, a liquid or even a gas. Some examples of storage materials are
water, air, concrete, brick, bedrock, oil and molten salt (IRENA, 2013). The amount
of heat stored depends on the specific heat capacity of the material. There are
disadvantages and advantages to every material, but when designing a sensible heat
storage system, the material is usually chosen based on the heat capacity and the space
that is available for storage. Other properties which are important to consider when
selecting a suitable material include chemical stability, compatibility with container
materials, density, vapor pressure, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity.
Sensible heat can be calculated with equation 2.1:
𝑄 = 𝑚 × 𝑐𝑝 × 𝛥𝑇

2.1

where Q is the amount of heat stored in the material (J), m is the mass of storage
material (kg), cp is the specific heat capacity of the storage material at constant pressure
(J/kgK) and ΔT is the temperature change (K) (Cabeza, et al., 2015).

2.1.2 Latent thermal (heat) storage
Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) is characterized by a large energy storage
capacity, and a small variation in operating temperature because of the phase transition
of PCMs at their melting point. The sensible heat (due to the increase in temperature)
and the latent heat (due to the phase transition) decide the amount of energy stored by
PCMs. In LHTES, the PCMs undergo a phase transition when heated or cooled to the
phase change temperature; there can be solid-liquid, solid-gas, liquid-gas and solidsolid systems. Solid-gas and liquid-gas have a higher latent heat of phase transition
than solid-solid and solid-liquid phase transitions. However, any system involving a
phase change to gas is impractical and makes the system too complex due to the large
change in volume that occurs as the gas phase occupies a large volume. In a solid-solid
phase change process, thermal energy is stored or released when the crystalline
structure of the PCM changes. However, solid-solid PCMs mostly have a low energy
storage density and a slow transition rate. The main type of PCMs used for TES
applications are solid-liquid PCMs, due to their numerous advantages, which include
high thermal density, a small volume change (about 10% or less), compactness and
easy handling (Sharma, et al., 2009; Zhang, et al., 2018).
The most used and well-known PCM is water, ice has been used to store cold since
ancient times. When a solid-liquid PCM melts, heat is transferred to the material. Large
quantities of heat are stored while the PCM remains at constant temperature. When the
material solidifies, the stored heat is released. The amount of heat stored can be
calculated with equation 2.2:

6

2.2

𝑄 = 𝑚 × 𝛥ℎ

Where Q is the amount of heat stored in the material (J), m is the mass of the storage
material (kg) and Δh is the phase change enthalpy per unit mass (J/kg) (Cabeza, et al.,
2015). This formula accounts only for the latent heat. However, in a latent heat storage
system, it is likely that the PCM operates in a range slightly wider than just the
melting/solidification point. Thus, there is some sensible heat as well, so the heat
stored can be expressed as equations 2.3 and 2.4:
𝑇

𝑇

𝑄 = ∫𝑇 𝑚 𝑚 𝑐𝑝 𝑑𝑇 + 𝑚𝑎𝑚 𝛥ℎ + ∫𝑇 𝑓 𝑚𝑐𝑝 𝑑𝑇
𝑡
𝑚

2.3

𝑄 = 𝑚[𝑐𝑝,𝑠 (𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇𝑡 ) + 𝑎𝑚 𝛥ℎ + 𝑐𝑝,𝑙 (𝑇𝑓 − 𝑇𝑚 )]

2.4

where Q is the amount of heat stored in the material (J), m is the mass of the storage
material (kg), Tm is the melting temperature (°C), Tt is the initial temperature (°C), am
is the fraction melted, Δh is the phase change enthalpy per unit mass (J/kg), Tf is the
final temperature (°C), Cp,s is the average specific heat capacity between Tm and Tt
(J/kgK) and cp,l is the average specific heat capacity (J/kgK) between Tm and Tf,
(Sharma, et al., 2009).

2.1.3 Thermochemical storage (TCS)
Thermochemical energy storage involves using a reversible chemical reaction to store
energy. TCS is divided into chemical reactions and sorption systems. In chemical
reaction energy storage systems, there can be solid-gas, liquid-gas or gas phase
systems. In chemical reaction TCS, the heat resulting from a dissociation reaction is
stored, and this heat can then be recovered through the chemically reversible reaction.
As the products of the reaction are stored separately, TCM systems can be used as
seasonal storage systems (Cabeza, et al., 2015). The main challenge with chemical
reaction storage systems is to find a suitable reversible chemical reaction for the energy
source used (Nazir, et al., 2019).
In sorption systems, adsorption on solids or absorption on liquids is used to store
energy. Adsorption is the binding of a liquid or a gas on the inner surface of a porous
material. During desorption, heat is applied to the material, removing the constituents
from the surface. When adsorption occurs, the stored heat is released, thus discharging
the energy stored in the system (Cabeza, et al., 2015).
The amount of heat stored in TCS can be calculated using equation 2.5:
𝑄 = 𝑎𝑟 𝑚𝛥ℎ𝑟

2.5

where ar is the fraction that has reacted, m is the mass of the heat storage material (kg)
and Δhr is the endothermic heat of reaction (J/kg) (Sharma, et al., 2009).

From Table 1, it is possible to deduce that sensible heat storage is the cheapest option,
and thermochemical storage is the most efficient option. The most significant
advantage latent heat storage has over sensible heat storage is that heat can be stored
at almost constant temperature, and it has a greater energy storage density. The energy
storage density of solid-liquid PCMs is around 100 kWh/m3 (e.g., ice), while the
energy storage density for common sensible heat storage materials is around 25
kWh/m3. The energy storage density of thermochemical storage is even higher than
latent heat storage (Sarbu & Sebarchievici, 2018).
In Figure 2, another comparison of the different types of thermal energy storage are
shown. The lifetime of sensible heat storage materials is about four times greater than
latent heat storage materials, and ten times greater than thermochemical storage
materials. Thermochemical storage is still in the development phase, while some
PCMs are available commercially for latent heat storage although research efforts are
still ongoing. Sensible heat storage is largely available commercially (Nazir, et al.,
2019).

al., 2019).

2.2

Phase Change Materials (PCMs)

As solid-liquid PCMs are the main type of PCMs used for thermal energy storage, only
these are studied further in this thesis. Solid-liquid PCMs can be divided into three
different categories based on their chemical composition: organic PCMs, inorganic
PCMs and eutectic mixture PCMs, as shown in Figure 3.

9

Figure 3. Classification of PCMs and other thermal energy storage materials (Nazir,
et al., 2019).

Organic solid-liquid PCMs include fatty acids, alcohols, glycols, paraffins and
polymers such as polyethylene glycol (Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019). They are made of
hydrocarbons and are often used in LHTES systems. The phase change temperatures
for most organic solid-liquid PCMs are below 100 °C, so they are suitable for lowtemperature TES applications. Inorganic solid-liquid PCMs include molten salts, salt
hydrates, metals and alloys. The phase change temperature range for inorganic PCMs
is wide. Salt hydrates are applied in low-temperature TES, while metals, alloys and
molten salts are applied in middle-temperature and high-temperature TES. Eutectic
mixture PCMs are composites consisting of two or more materials that melt and
solidify at the same time, creating a mixture of the component crystal during
crystallization. Eutectic mixture PCMs have the same properties as that of the
components (Zhang, et al., 2018). Figure 4 shows different groups of PCM materials
and their typical melting temperature and melting enthalpy ranges.

melting enthalpy (Bruno, et al., 2014).

2.2.1 Important properties for PCMs
For practical applications, there are a number of properties that solid-liquid PCMs
should have:
1) Thermal properties: An appropriate melting point for the application, high
specific heat and phase change enthalpy and high thermal conductivity
(Zhang, et al., 2018).
When choosing a PCM for a specific application, the phase change
temperature of the PCM should fit the operating temperature of the heating or
cooling application. In order to keep the physical size of the heat storage as
small as possible, the latent heat and the specific heat should be high,
especially per unit volume. Having a high thermal conductivity enhances the
charging and discharging process of the energy storage (Sharma, et al., 2009).
2) Physical properties: no phase separation, high density, low volumetric change
and vapor pressure (Zhang, et al., 2018).
Better phase stability during melting and freezing would help against phase
separation, ensuring consistent behavior of the PCM. The higher the density,
the smaller the volume of the container for the PCM. Having small volume
changes during melting/freezing and a low vapor pressure allow for a smaller

and simpler container (Sharma, et al., 2009).
3) Chemical properties: non-toxic, non-flammable, non-polluting, noncorrosive, compatibility with the chosen container and sustained chemical
stability (Zhang, et al., 2018).
For safety reasons, PCMs should be non-toxic, non-flammable and nonexplosive. Another reason for non-flammability is to comply with building
safety codes (Hasan, et al., 2017). To reduce the environmental impact, the
PCM should pollute as little as possible during its life cycle. The PCM should
be non-corrosive to be compatible with certain metal containers. The PCM
should be chemically stable to ensure a long lifetime. PCMs can degrade by
being incompatible with the chosen container, or by loss of water of
hydration or through chemical decomposition (Sharma, et al., 2009).
4) Kinetic properties: reversible phase transition, adequate crystallization rate
and low degree of supercooling (Zhang, et al., 2018).
Supercooling, also known as subcooling, is when the PCM is cooling down
and does not start to solidify at its solidification temperature. The PCM
instead turns into a supercooled liquid, reaching a temperature lower than the
melting temperature before solidification starts to occur. The difference
between the minimum temperature reached and the solidification temperature
is the degree of supercooling (D’Avignon, 2015). Supercooling is an issue
present in some PCMs, especially salt hydrates. Supercooling greater than a
few degrees is a hindrance to properly extracting heat from the store, and
supercooling of 5-10 °C might totally prevent the extraction of heat (Sharma,
et al., 2009).
5) Economic: low cost, an abundant and easily available resource and good
recyclability (Zhang, et al., 2018).
For economic reasons, the PCM should be cheap and largely available.
Recyclability improves the economics and decreases the environmental costs
of the PCM (Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019).

However, there is still no PCM that satisfies all of the above requirements. The most
prevalent problems with solid-liquid PCMs are low thermal conductivity,
supercooling, phase separation and liquid leakage. As such, research is focused on
developing techniques to enhance the combined properties of PCMs (Zhang, et al.,
2018).
General criteria for selecting PCMs for TES applications are shown in Figure 5. The

12

show stoppers are: cost, regulatory compliance and product safety. The
thermophysical properties however, are a game changer. These properties tell how
suitable a PCM is for a particular application, and thus they need to be investigated
thoroughly. The operating environment and the reliability are the enablers, while the
end user perception and convenience are the differentiators that enable the PCM TES
system to compete with other technologies (Nazir, et al., 2019).

Figure 5. General selection criteria for phase change materials for thermal energy
storage applications (Nazir, et al., 2019).

Usually, PCMs alone cannot be used as a heat transfer medium. A heat exchanger
using a separate heat transfer medium must be used to transfer energy from the source
to the PCM, and from the PCM to the load. The heat exchanger should be designed so
that it takes into account the low thermal diffusivity of PCMs. The volume changes
that occur when the PCM changes phase also have to be taken into account when
designing the container for the PCM. The container should be large enough to contain
the PCM and it should be compatible with the PCM that is used. Thus, any latent heat
energy storage system should have at least the following three components (Sharma,
et al., 2009):
1. A suitable PCM. The melting point should be in the desired temperature range.
2. A suitable heat exchange surface.
3. A suitable container that is compatible with the PCM.
So in order to develop a latent heat thermal energy storage system, knowledge of the

13

following three components is necessary: PCMs, heat exchangers and the materials of
the containers (Sharma, et al., 2009). In Figure 6, a flow chart of the different steps
taken in designing a latent heat thermal energy storage system is shown.

Figure 6. A flow chart showing the different steps in developing a latent heat thermal
energy storage system (Sharma, et al., 2009).

Through comparison of latent heats of pure PCM substances in the form of analytical
grade chemicals with those of commercialized products, it is possible to see that the
energy storage density is lower in commercialized products. The reason is that
commercial products add nucleating agents, form stabilizers, and additives to prevent
supercooling, to control phase change temperatures and to stabilize mixtures from
phase separation. These do not contribute to the latent heat of the PCM, and as result,
the latent heat per unit mass is lower (Chiu, 2013).
PCMs are used for different temperature ranges, and in literature PCMs have been
divided into different groups based on their melting temperature. However, the groups
and their temperature ranges tend to vary with the applications considered for the
groups (Pielichowska & Pielichowski, 2014; Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019; Nazir, et al.,
2019). According to one definition, PCMs with a melting temperature from -20 °C to
+5 °C are included in the low temperature range. These PCMs are commonly used for
domestic and commercial refrigeration. The medium-low temperature range includes
PCMs with a melting temperature from +5 °C to +40 °C. These PCMs are used for

14

cooling and heating applications in buildings. PCMs in the medium temperature range
with a melting temperature from +40 °C to +80 °C are used in solar heating systems
and for hot water and electronic applications. PCMs in the high temperature range with
a melting temperature from +80 °C to +200 °C and beyond are used for electricity
generation, waste heat recovery and absorption cooling (Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019).

2.2.2 Organic Solid-Liquid PCMs
Organic solid-liquid PCMs are a notable class of PCMs as they are thermally and
chemically stable, non-corrosive to metals and recyclable (Elias & Stathopoulos,
2019). Some of their excellent thermal properties include high energy density, no
phase segregation, little or no supercooling, narrow phase change temperature ranges,
congruent melting and self-nucleation. These favorable properties have made them
suitable for applications in solar energy storage, building energy conservation, textiles
and for cooling electronic devices and batteries (Zhang, et al., 2018). However, their
drawbacks are low thermal conductivity (from 0.1 to 0.7 W/m K) (Pereira da Cunha
& Eames, 2016), flammability, a lower phase change enthalpy compared to other
PCMs and possible incompatibility with polymer containers or encapsulation media,
leading to leakage from the container (Elias & Stathopoulos, 2019). Recently, progress
has been made in research on improving the thermal conductivity and preventing liquid
leakage of organic PCMs (Zhang, et al., 2018). Organic PCMs can be divided into
paraffins and non-paraffins. Non-paraffins are the largest category of PCMs, their
properties vary widely and each material has its own properties unlike the paraffins,
which have rather similar properties (Sharma, et al., 2009).
Paraffin waxes are the most used commercial organic PCMs due to their great
performance. The chemical formula for paraffin waxes is C nH2n+2, they consist of a
mix of straight n-alkanes. Paraffin waxes are produced on a large scale, they are a byproduct from refining of crude oil. They are cheaper than pure n-alkanes. Paraffins
possess good thermophysical properties: they are chemically inert and stable below
500 °C, the volume change between molten and solid state is small, their vapor
pressure in the molten state is low, they have a high latent heat density, no phase
segregation, are non-corrosive, self-nucleate and have a wide range of phase change
temperatures (Sharma, et al., 2009; Zhang, et al., 2018). The higher the amount of
carbon atoms in a chain, the higher the melting point (Sharma, et al., 2009). For carbon
chains with a length ranging from 14 to 34 carbon atoms, the melting temperature
ranges from 5.5–75.9 °C. Table 2 lists the thermal properties of some commercial
paraffin waxes. When comparing the densities of the solid and molten states, the
largest difference in density is about 17.3%, while the lowest is about 1.2%, while the
average is about 13%. As earlier mentioned, literature tends to state that the volume
change between the molten and solid states of paraffin waxes is small, but these
commercial paraffins shows that the density differences can vary. The phase change

15

temperatures of these paraffins range from 18–71 °C, making them suitable for lowtemperature TES. Their phase change enthalpies are almost the same as the phase
change enthalpies of pure n-alkanes. The downsides of paraffin waxes are low
compatibility, low thermal conductivity, liquidity and moderate flammability (Zhang,
et al., 2018).
Table 2. Thermal properties of commercial paraffins (Zhang, et al., 2018)

Fatty acids are carboxylic acids, consisting of long hydrocarbon chains with a carboxyl
group at the end. The chemical formula of fatty acids is CH 3(CH2)2nCOOH. There is
an abundance of fatty acid resources in the world as they frequently occur as esters in
oil and fats (Zhang, et al., 2018). The fatty acid mixtures can be obtained by first
hydrolyzing animal- and plant-based oils and fats, and then purifying and separating
them (Iqbal, et al., 2019). Usually, fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms,
ranging from 4 to 28. Common fatty acids used as PCMs are arachidic acid, capric
acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid. The melting point ranges
from 30 to 74 °C for fatty acids, while the latent heat ranges from 140 to 208 kJ/kg
(Zhang, et al., 2018). The melting and freezing transitions of fatty acids are reversible,

16

they can withstand thousands of melting/freezing cycles without thermal degradation
(Iqbal, et al., 2019). Upon freezing, fatty acids do not undergo supercooling. The latent
heat values of fatty acids are similar to those of paraffins. However, a significant
disadvantage of fatty acids is that they are about 2–2.5 times more expensive than
technical-grade paraffins (Sharma, et al., 2009). Another downside of fatty acids is
that they are mildly corrosive. In Table 3, the results of corrosion testing of four
different fatty acids on four different types of metals are shown. C20 steel was slightly
corroded by two of the tested fatty acids, while copper was corroded by every fatty
acid. To overcome the corrosion problem, fatty acids esters can be produced from fatty
acids through esterification. Fatty acid esters are non-corrosive and have a better odor
than fatty acids (Sarı, et al., 2010).

Another significant negative aspect of fatty acids is that some of them are toxic to
various degrees, with some of them releasing toxic fumes at higher temperatures.

Sugar alcohols are organic PCMs of natural origin applicable for TES applications
from low to medium temperatures (70-180 °C). Sugar alcohols are non-corrosive, nonflammable, non-toxic and cheap. Despite belonging to the organic PCM category, the
performances of sugar alcohols are similar to those of most salt hydrates. As an added
benefit, sugar alcohols lack the problems of phase segregation and corrosion that salt
hydrates have. Some sugar alcohols have a volumetric latent heat twice that of other
commonly used PCMs, such as paraffin waxes. The high density and the relatively
large latent heat of sugar alcohols give them a high volumetric energy density during
melting of up to 100–150 kWh/m3, which is higher than other organic PCMs such as
paraffins, fatty acids and esters (del Barrio, et al., 2017).
Polyethylene glycol (PEG), also known as poly(oxyethylene) is an organic PCM
consisting of linear oxyethylene (-O-CH2-CH2-) with ending groups of hydroxyl (-OH)
(Iqbal, et al., 2019). PEGs have several advantageous characteristics such as high latent
heat, biodegradability, low vapor pressure, no supercooling, being chemically and
thermally stable, and being non-corrosive and non-toxic. The molecular weight of PEG
ranges from 200 to 20 000 g/mol. The phase change temperature of PEG can be
changed by modifying the molecular weight. The melting temperature of PEG
increases with increasing molecular weight. The latent heat of PEG also rises with
molecular weight until a molecular weight of 10 000 g/mol. The latent heat starts to
decrease with increasing molecular weight beyond 10 000 g/mol due to the decrease
in crystallinity of PEG caused by the longer molecular chains (Zhang, et al., 2018).
The thermal properties of PEG PCMs are shown in Table 5.

18

Table 5. Thermal properties of PEG (Zhang, et al., 2018)

2.2.3 Inorganic Solid-Liquid PCMs
Generally, the latent heat per unit volume of inorganic PCMs is double that of organic
PCMs. Inorganic PCMs are cheaper compared to organic PCMs, and their thermal
conductivity is slightly higher (Zhang, et al., 2018).
Salt hydrates are inorganic solid-liquid PCMs which consist of water and inorganic
salt, their general formula is AB ∙ nH2O. Salt hydrates are the most significant group
of PCMs for low- and medium temperature applications. Extensive research has been
conducted on salt hydrates for LHTES applications due to their high latent heat per
unit volume (Zhang, et al., 2018), insignificant volume variation during phase change
(less than 1%) and their relatively high thermal conductivity (Hassan, et al., 2016).
Salt hydrates are compatible with plastics, they have low toxicity and many salt
hydrates are sufficiently cheap to be used for energy storage (Sharma, et al., 2009).
Salt hydrates consist of water and inorganic salts combined through chemical bonds.
The bonds can be broken at high temperatures and recovered at low temperatures
(Zhang, et al., 2018). The phase change process is actually a dehydration/hydration
process, but this process resembles thermodynamical melting or freezing. The
dehydration/hydration can be expressed as the equations below, either the salt hydrates
(AB) melt to a salt hydrate with fewer moles of water (Sharma, et al., 2009):
𝐴𝐵 ∙ 𝑛𝐻2 𝑂 ↔ 𝐴𝐵 ∙ 𝑚𝐻2 𝑂 + (𝑛 − 𝑚)𝐻2 𝑂

2.6

or the salt hydrate melts to its anhydrous form:
𝐴𝐵 ∙ 𝑛𝐻2 𝑂 ↔ 𝐴𝐵 + 𝑛𝐻2 𝑂

2.7

When the temperature of the salt hydrate is higher than the melting point, all or part of
the water is dehydrated while absorbing heat. Phase separation is a problem with salt
hydrates due to incongruent melting (Sharma, et al., 2009). Often, the released water
is unable to dissolve the salt/lower hydrate, and so the released water and salt/lower

19

hydrate separate in the container due to differences in density. The cause of phase
separation is the poor nucleation properties of salt hydrates. Poor nucleation also leads
to supercooling, which is when there is a difference between the melting temperature
and the freezing temperature (Zhang, et al., 2018). The corrosivity of salt hydrates is
also a problem, they corrode commonly used metals including aluminum, copper and
stainless steel (Pereira da Cunha & Eames, 2016).
There are three types of behavior for melting hydrate salts: congruent melting,
incongruent melting and semi-congruent melting. Congruent melting occurs when the
anhydrous salt is entirely soluble in its water of hydration at the melting point.
Incongruent melting occurs when the salt is not completely soluble in its water of
hydration at the melting temperature. In semi-congruent melting, the solid and liquid
phases are at different melting compositions at equilibrium because the hydrate has
been converted to a lower-hydrated material by losing water. The most significant
problem with salt hydrates is that those that are suitable for thermal energy storage
suffer from incongruent melting. When there is not enough water to melt the salt, the
resulting solution is supersaturated at the melting temperature. The solid salt with its
higher density sinks down to the bottom of the container. It does not recombine with
water when freezing occurs. Hence, an irreversible loss of storage capacity occurs, and
the storage capacity keeps decreasing with each charge-discharge cycle (Sharma, et
al., 2009).
Molten salts are high-temperature PCMs, with melting points ranging from 250 to
1680 °C and the latent heat ranging from 68 to 1041 kJ/kg. One main use for molten
salts is in the food and textile industries, where they are used for low- and medium
temperature steam generation between 100 and 450 °C. Another use of molten salts is
for high-temperature steam generation. In this case they are used in conventional
power plants or concentrating solar power plants for generating electricity (Zhang, et
al., 2018).
Molten salts can be divided into carbonates, chlorides, fluorides, nitrates and sulfates.
Nitrates are the most common PCMs for TES systems operating at high temperatures,
although they decompose at temperatures greater than 550 °C. Fluorides have a higher
thermal decomposition temperature, and they have various applications in
environments of extreme heat, such as in nuclear and aerospace industries. But their
downside is the large increase in volume when they change phase changes from solid
to liquid. This large increase in volume leads to cavitation, which reduces the effective
heat transfer. An issue with chlorides and sulfates is that they are highly corrosive,
which makes it difficult to find a suitable material for containers or pipelines. The
thermal properties of carbonates are lacking, and they have high viscosities which
results in worse heat transfer efficiency compared to the other types of molten salts
(Zhang, et al., 2018).
Most metals and alloys have a melting temperature larger than 300 °C, making them

20

suitable for high temperature TES systems. They do not have the problems molten
salts have, which are corrosivity and large changes in volume between liquid and solid
states. Metals and alloys are also characterized by outstanding thermal conductivity
and high energy storage density per volume. There are three classes of metal and
alloys, depending on the main components: aluminum alloys, copper alloys and
magnesium alloys. Mercury is an example of a metal in liquid state at room
temperature. It has a melting point of -39 °C, but it is highly toxic. Gallium, rubidium
and cesium have a low melting point and could thus be used in low-temperature TES
if only the melting point was considered. However, their chemical properties are
extremely unstable (Zhang, et al., 2018). The density of metals limits their possible
use as PCMs. Metals have a low latent heat per unit mass, but they are good candidates
as PCMs if a high latent heat per volume is desired (Sharma, et al., 2009).

2.2.4 Eutectic Mixture PCMs
There are three groups of eutectic mixture PCMs depending on the constituent
materials: organic-organic, inorganic-inorganic, and inorganic-organic. A eutectic
mixture is a combination of two or more compounds which provide the minimum
melting point. The thermal performance of a eutectic mixture is the same as that of its
components, and eutectic mixtures melt and solidify without segregation. The main
advantage of eutectic mixture PCMs is their sharp phase change temperature that can
be modified by mixing different mass ratios of the constituent materials together
(Zhang, et al., 2018). Eutectic mixtures also tend to have high densities and thermal
conductivities. However, their latent heat and specific heat capacity is low (Sarbu &
Sebarchievici, 2018).

2.3

Encapsulation of PCMs

One way of improving the characteristics of PCMs is by encapsulating them.
Encapsulation is the process of enclosing a particle in a wall, or embedding the particle
in a heterogeneous or homogeneous matrix, forming a capsule. Capsules can have a
regular (e.g., oval, spherical or tubular) or an irregular shape. The encapsulation of
PCMs can be divided into three categories based on the diameter of the capsule:
nanoencapsulation (<1 µm), microencapsulation (1 µm to 1 mm) and
macroencapsulation (> 1 mm). When encapsulating, a pocket of air is sometimes left
in the core to leave room for the volumetric changes that take place during phase
change. The shell should be strong to withstand the stresses caused by the volume
changes during the phase change. The core can be solid or scattered into a carrier fluid.
An encapsulated PCM with the core scatted into a carrier fluid is known as a
microencapsulated phase change material slurry (Nazir, et al., 2019). Encapsulation

21

increases the heat transfer area of PCMs, which increases the heat transfer rate
(Chandel & Agarwal, 2017). By encapsulating a PCM, contact with the environment
is avoided, and the volume change can be controlled. Encapsulation of PCMs can
tackle some of the problems that cause a decrease in the rate of heat release and the
thermal efficiency of a system, such as supercooling, thermal instability and low
conductivity (Nazir, et al., 2019).
There are numerous methods to encapsulate PCMs. The macroencapsulation process
can be done by filling a pre-made shell with liquid PCM, while more complicated
processes are required for microencapsulation (Liu, et al., 2018). The methods for
encapsulation can be grouped into four different categories: physio-mechanical,
chemical, physio-chemical and mechanical as shown in Figure 7. All methods except
the mechanical-electroplating method can be used to encapsulate organic PCMs, while
the methods highlighted in Figure 7 can be used to encapsulate inorganic PCMs (Nazir,
et al., 2019).

Figure 7. Encapsulation methods for PCMs, methods marked with ** are for inorganic
PCMs (Nazir, et al., 2019).

2.3.1 Macroencapsulation
It is more common for various shapes of capsules to be used for macroencapsulation,
while for microencapsulation, spherical capsules are common. Macroencapsulation

22

thus gives great flexibility as various shapes and sizes can be utilized (Liu, et al., 2018).
Metallic containers are usually applied for high temperatures and when the aim is to
achieve high heat transfer, otherwise plastic containers are common. However, the
compatibility of the containers with the PCM must always be confirmed first (Kant, et
al., 2017). Various types of macroencapsulation used by the PCM manufacturer
Rubitherm are shown in Figure 8 including an aluminum case, rectangular plastic
cases, foil, polymer bags and aluminum compound foil (Rubitherm Technologies
GmbH, 2019a; Rubitherm Technologies GmbH, 2019b).

Figure 8. Macroencapsulation of PCMs by the company Rubitherm, in an aluminum
case in the top-left (Rubitherm Technologies GmbH, 2019a), rectangular plastic
containers in the top-right, and in foil in the bottom-left, transparent polymer bag in
the bottom-centre, and aluminum compound foil in the bottom-right (Rubitherm
Technologies GmbH, 2019b).

The production of macroencapsulated PCMs is simpler, and thus cheaper, than the
production of microencapsulated PCMs. The downsides of macroencapsulation are
that the surface-to-volume ratio is lower, giving reduced heat transfer efficiency
compared to microencapsulation, inhomogeneous melting/solidification of the PCM
inside the shells (Liu, et al., 2018) and leakage issues (Chandel & Agarwal, 2017).
Attempts have been made to integrate macroencapsulated PCMs into building

23

structures in order to improve the thermal comfort of buildings. Due to some of the
earlier mentioned problem of macroencapsulated PCMs, the products are not yet
commercially successful. Microencapsulated PCMs overcome many of these
problems, which may make PCM products more viable for the building industry
(Sharma, et al., 2009).

2.3.2 Microencapsulation
The benefits of microencapsulating PCMs include improving the chemical stability
and thermal reliability, preventing leakage, controlling the change in volume between
the different phases, and avoiding interactions with the environment.
Microencapsulated PCMs can easily be incorporated into conventional building
materials (Chandel & Agarwal, 2017). Microencapsulation also decreases problems
with phase separation and cycling stability because the molecular distances shrink to
microscopic levels (Stanković, 2014). Microencapsulation gives higher charging and
discharging rates than macroencapsulation due to a greater surface area to volume
ratio. Unfortunately, the high cost of producing microencapsulated PCMs limits their
use in TES applications (Nazir, et al., 2019). Other drawbacks of microencapsulation
are that the strength of the material can be affected, and that it can lead to the
occurrence of supercooling (Chandel & Agarwal, 2017). An example of a commercial
microencapsulated PCM is Micronal® PCM manufactured by Microtek Laboratories,
Inc. This PCM can be used in building and construction as a bedding material. The
product is available as a slurry (35-45 % solids) and as a dry powder (>97% solids)
(Microtek Laboratories, Inc., 2019).

2.3.3 Nanoencapsulation
Nanoencapsulation is a recently developed technique for encapsulation of PCMs. The
benefits of nanoencapsulation are similar to that of microencapsulation, including
preventing leakage, improving the thermophysical properties, enhancing heat transfer
characteristics and increasing the reliability (the cycle life i.e., the amount of chargingdischarging cycles) (Nazir, et al., 2019). The structure of nanocapsules is stronger than
that of macro- and microcapsules. The research progress for nanoencapsulation is still
in the laboratory demonstration phase, more research is needed to bring
nanoencapsulation into commercial use. Studies have shown that there is potential for
the use of nanoencapsulated PCMs for thermal energy storage applications in buildings
and other applications. The different nanoencapsulated PCMs studied have possessed
different favorable characteristics such as good thermal reliability and chemical
stability, high heat transfer rates and high thermal conductivity (Kant, et al., 2017).

24

2.4

Methods for determining the thermophysical properties of solid-liquid
PCMs

To design a LHTES system, the thermophysical properties of the solid-liquid PCM to
be used in the system must first be known. The most common performance parameters
to consider are the phase change temperature and latent heat, thermal conductivity,
thermal and chemical stability, thermal reliability, density and compatibility with the
container.
There are some challenges with testing the properties of PCMs, as there are no
international standards or test specifications in place for the evaluation of PCMs (Xie,
et al., 2013). In the following sub-chapters, the water bath method, differential thermal
analysis (DTA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are briefly described, while
the T-history method is described in detail. The T-history method was chosen to be
implemented as a demo-environment on energy storage for the laboratory in
Technobotnia due to the low cost of the equipment needed, and because there is still
research interest in the T-history method, with different setups and improvements still
being developed by researchers.

2.4.1 Water bath method
The water bath method by Demirel & Paksoy (1993) is a non-commercial method,
used for testing the thermal performance of encapsulated heat storage materials in large
non-stirred samples (samples that need a slow heating process). The method can be
used in the temperature range 0–200 °C. Sample sizes of about 1.2–2.2 kg were
analyzed. The energy loads of two identical thermostatic baths are measured and
compared. This method gives information on the enthalpy changes due to the sensible
and latent heats, the heating and cooling curves and also the heat transfer
characteristics between the sample and the various working liquids.
Each water bath (Techne TU-16A with a capacity of 42.5–48.5 l) is heated by an
electrical resistance heater. It is assumed that all electrical power is converted to heat,
so the energy load can be adjusted by a variac. One of the baths contains encapsulated
samples in Pyrex tubes with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 300 mm. The second
bath contains the working liquid (water, silicone oil or polyethylene glycol can be
used, depending on the operating temperature), with similar experimental conditions.
Two types of experiments are performed to retrieve all information of the sample. In
the first experiment, the PCM is in the first bath, and the second bath contains only the
working liquid. In the second experiment, the second bath contains a reference material
with the same encapsulation as the PCM. Thermograms obtained using a DuPont 910
DSC was used to validate the results. The energy and melting points obtained with the
water bath method were consistent with the DSC thermograms (Demirel & Paksoy,

25

1993).

2.4.2 Differential thermal analysis (DTA)
DTA is the earliest thermal measurement technology used, and it used to be the most
studied. DTA has a wide temperature range, from -180 °C to 2400 °C. DTA is used to
determine the specific heat capacity and the latent heat of fusion. The properties of a
PCM are evaluated by measuring the temperature difference between a PCM and a
reference material, when both are subject to the same heat load. The reference material
and sample are each placed in a crucible of their own. A differential thermocouple is
placed to measure the temperature difference of the PCM and the reference material.
Using a temperature or time control program, the reference and the PCM are
compared. The differential temperature is plotted against time, obtaining a DTA curve.
As the thermal properties of the PCM and the reference are different, their temperature
changes are also different even though they absorb the same amount of heat (Xie, et
al., 2013).

2.4.3 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
DSC is a thermo-analytical technique, where a sample and a reference material are
placed in sample holders in a differential scanning calorimeter after which they are
subjected to a temperature program at the same time. The typical sample volumes used
for DSC analysis are from 10 µl to 50 µl. The precision of the temperature sensors is
commonly < 0.1 K, and heat is determined with an uncertainty that is usually less than
5 % (Günther, et al., 2009). The sample is heated or cooled from its initial temperature
to a temperature past the phase change temperature, after which the sample remains
isothermal shortly before it is heated or cooled back to its initial temperature. There
are two operation modes for a DSC: dynamic mode and isothermal step mode (also
known as step-scan mode) (Bruno, et al., 2014). For the dynamic mode, the heating
rate is constant, while the heating rate is variable in the isothermal step mode. The
dynamic mode is the most common operating mode for DSC (Günther, et al., 2009).
An example of a DSC with a dedicated chiller connected to it, manufactured by Perkin
Elmer, is shown in Figure 9. This DSC can test samples of temperatures from -170 °C
to 750 °C (Bruno, et al., 2014).

that it is connected to the DSC (Bruno, et al., 2014).

There are some problematic characteristics that PCMs may have which make
determining their properties with DSC difficult. These include hysteresis,
supercooling, wide melting-range and crystallization problems. Also the DSC itself,
the sample mass, the heating and cooling rate and the operation mode can affect the
DSC results (Bruno, et al., 2014). Supercooling is often more significant in small
samples than in large samples, so the DSC results may not be representative for PCMs
used in actual applications. Many PCMs also contain additives, such as gelling
materials, nucleating agents, heat transfer enhancing additives etc. Obtaining a
representative sample that is 10 µl to 50 µl in size is rather difficult or maybe not even
possible. To solve these problems, larger sample sizes should be used (Günther, et al.,
2009).

2.4.4 T-history method
According to Zhang & Jiang (1999), the DTA and DSC methods have some flaws,
which their T-history method improves upon. One flaw is that the sample size in DTA
and DSC is small (1–10 mg), when some behaviors of PCMs depend on their quantity.
Moreover, the equipment used in DTA and DSC is complex and expensive, and the
phase change cannot be visually observed. The T-history method proposed by Zhang
& Jiang is simple and it uses basic laboratory equipment that is available in most
laboratories. The method can be used to establish the phase change temperature, the
degree of supercooling, latent heat of fusion, specific heat capacity and the thermal
conductivity of several PCM samples simultaneously. The T-history method is thus
useful for selecting candidate PCMs from a group of PCMs or for analyzing newly
prepared PCMs to be used in practical systems. A comparison of the thermal analysis
methods of DTA, DSC, the water bath method and the T-history method is shown in
Table 6. It is clear that the main advantages of the T-history method are the larger
sample sizes than those of DTA and DSC, and the lower maintenance requirement and

27

the lower price of the equipment. A wider temperature range than water baths can be
achieved with the T-history method by using an oil bath instead of a water bath (Zhang
& Jiang, 1999). However, many of the newer and improved T-history method setups
use a climate chamber for both the heating and cooling, so the temperature range is
decided by the limits of the climate chamber’s operational temperatures (Solé, et al.,
2013).

There have been several T-history setups throughout the years since the T-history
method was first proposed by Zhang & Jiang in 1999, with various modifications and
improvements made to the original setup. Modifications have been made both to the
components of the setup and to the mathematical models used to evaluate the
measurement results. A few papers have listed or reviewed these different setups (Solé,
et al., 2013; D’Avignon & Kummert, 2015; Tan, et al., 2017).
In the original T-history method, one or several glass test tubes are filled with PCM
samples, while one test tube is filled with a reference substance with well-known
thermophysical properties, for example, water. Thermoprobes 108 mm in length and
0.7 mm in diameter are placed in the PCM samples along the axis of each tube to
measure the temperature. The test tubes are placed in a water bath, which heats the
PCM samples to a uniform temperature, T0, above the melting point of the PCM (T0 >
Tm, Tm is the melting point of the PCM). Hence, the PCM samples are in liquid phase.
Then, the test tubes containing the samples and the reference are suddenly exposed to
an ambient temperature, Ta,∞ (which can be time dependent), and a temperature versus
time curve or T-history curve of the PCM is obtained. As the PCM samples cool, they
undergo phase change from liquid to solid, while the reference, water in this case, does

28

not undergo phase change. The samples and the reference cool down to a reference
temperature, Tr, a temperature that can be chosen which is lower than the solidification
temperature, Ts. The thermophysical properties are determined by comparing Thistory curves of the PCM samples and the reference (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).
Figure 10 shows a typical T-history curve for a PCM which undergoes supercooling.
The degree of supercooling is taken to be ΔTm = Tm – Ts, where Tm is the temperature
when the PCM melts and Ts is the temperature when the PCM turns solid.

Figure 10. T-history curve of a PCM during cooling, when the PCM undergoes
supercooling (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).

Figure 11 shows the T-history curve of a PCM which does not undergo supercooling.

Figure 12 shows the T-history curve of water, used as a reference substance.

Figure 12. T-history curve of the reference substance water during cooling (Zhang &
Jiang, 1999).

The T-history method relies on two important assumptions. The first assumption is
that the overall heat flow, Q (W), from the reference to the ambient and from the
sample to the ambient are equal for the same reference and sample temperature, T (°C).

30

In other words, the overall heat transfer coefficient, or the thermal resistance R th
(°C/W) of the sample holder, is assumed to be equal for the same temperature
difference between the temperature of the PCM or reference, T ref/PCM, and the ambient
air, Ta,∞, Tref/PCM – Ta,∞ (Tan, et al., 2017):
𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑓 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓 ) = 𝑄𝑃𝐶𝑀 (𝑇𝑃𝐶𝑀 ) =

1
𝑅𝑡ℎ (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓/𝑃𝐶𝑀 )

(𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓/𝑃𝐶𝑀− 𝑇𝑎,∞ )

2.8

In reality, the heat transfer is multi-dimensional, and assuring one-dimensional heat
transfer can be difficult. Equation 2.8 is thus more of an approximation of the heat flux
from the test tubes to the ambient. Included in the thermal resistance, Rth(Tref/PCM), are
form factors, such as the overall heat transfer area of the test tubes. Therefore, test
tubes of the same size and shape should be used for the PCMs and the reference (Tan,
et al., 2018). To further strengthen the validity of this assumption, some studies have
added insulation around the test tubes, so that the insulation becomes the dominant
part of the total heat resistance (Solé, et al., 2013).
The other important assumption of the T-history method is that the temperature
distribution in the reference and the sample holders is uniform. For uninsulated sample
holders as in the original method by Zhang & Jiang, this assumption has been justified
by keeping the Biot number below 0.1, so that the lumped capacitance model can be
used. The Biot number is the ratio of heat transfer by convection to that of conduction.
Despite keeping the Biot number below 0.1 thermal gradients might still exist. The
thermal gradients can be reduced by decreasing the overall cooling or heating rate by
insulating the test tubes, as earlier mentioned. If a climate chamber is used for heating
or cooling, the temperature step change can be decreased (Tan, et al., 2018). The Biot
number is calculated using the following formula (Tan, et al., 2017):
𝐵𝑖 =

ℎ𝑐 𝐿
𝑘

2.9

where hc (W/m2 °C) is the natural convective heat-transfer coefficient of the air outside
the tube, L (m) is the characteristic length of the test tube and k (W/m °C) is the thermal
conductivity of the PCM or reference.
Two different definitions of characteristic length can be used for calculating the Biot
number. The first definition defines characteristic length as the ratio between volume
and heat transfer area. The second, more conservative definition defines the
characteristic length as the distance corresponding to the highest temperature gradient.
Some researchers have used the first definition, equation 2.10, while others have used
the second definition, 2.11:
𝐵𝑖 = ℎ𝑐 × 𝑅 / 2 × 𝑘

2.10

𝐵𝑖 = ℎ𝑐 × 𝑅 / 𝑘

2.11

where R is the radius of the tube. In order to meet the Biot requirement, the diameter

31

of the test tubes is kept small, and the test tubes usually have a large length-to-diameter
ratio (L/D > 10) (Mazo, et al., 2015).
A previous study concluded that the heat transfer due to radiation can be disregarded.
In the study, the test tubes were covered in aluminum foil in order to see if radiation
had any effect, but there were no significant differences in the results for test tubes
with and without aluminum (Solé, et al., 2013).
By using the two assumptions of the T-history method, a thermal energy balance can
be formed which is expressed in terms of the measured temperatures, and thus the
thermophysical properties of a PCM sample can be estimated (Mazo, et al., 2015).
Using the lumped capacitance model, the following equation for the liquid phase is
obtained:
(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑝 𝑐𝑝,𝑙 )(𝑇0 − 𝑇𝑠 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴1

2.12

where mt is the mass of the tube, cp,t is the specific heat capacity of the tube material,
mp is the mass of the PCM, cp,l is the specific heat capacity of the liquid PCM, Ac is
the convective heat-transfer area of the tube, and A1 is the area under the curve in
𝑡

Figure 10 and Figure 11 (𝐴1 = ∫0 1 (𝑇 − 𝑇∞,𝑎 )𝑑𝑡) (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).
Also the equation for the latent heat of fusion is obtained:
𝑚𝑝 𝐻𝑚 = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴2

2.13

where Hm is the latent heat of fusion of the PCM, and A2 is the area under the curve in
𝑡

Figure 10 and Figure 11 (𝐴2 = ∫𝑡 2 (𝑇 − 𝑇∞,𝑎 )𝑑𝑡). The phase-change occurs during t1
1
 t2 (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).
Furthermore, an equation for the solid phase is obtained:
(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑝 𝑐𝑝,𝑠 )(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑟 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴3

2.14

where cp,s is the mean specific heat capacity of the solid PCM, Tr is the reference
temperature and A3 is the area under the curve in Figure 10 and Figure 11 (𝐴3 =
𝑡3

∫𝑡2 (𝑇 − 𝑇∞,𝑎 )𝑑𝑡) (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).
The equations obtained for the tube containing the reference (distilled water in this
case) which does not undergo phase change, are as follows:
(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 )(𝑇0 − 𝑇𝑠 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴′1

2.15

(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 )(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇𝑟 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴′2

2.16

where mw is the mass of water, cp,w is the mean specific heat capacity of water, and 𝐴′1

32

𝑡′

and 𝐴′2 are the areas under the curve in Figure 12 (𝐴′1 = ∫0 1 (𝑇 − 𝑇∞,𝑎 )dt and 𝐴′2 =
𝑡′

∫𝑡12 (𝑇 − 𝑇∞,𝑎 )dt) (Zhang & Jiang, 1999).
With equation 2.15, the natural convective heat-transfer coefficient, h, of air outside
the tube can be calculated.
Using equations 2.12 to 2.16, the following equations are obtained (Zhang & Jiang,
1999):
𝑐𝑝,𝑠 =
𝑐𝑝,𝑙 =
𝐻𝑚 =

In the original T-history method by Zhang & Jiang (1999), equations 2.17–2.18 are
used to calculate the specific heat of the PCM in solid and liquid form. The latent heat
of fusion for a PCM with supercooling is calculated using equation 2.19. For
calculating the latent heat of fusion for a PCM without supercooling, equation 2.19 is
rewritten to:
𝐻𝑚 =

2.20

Zhang & Jiang (1999) also proposed using the T-history method to determine the
thermal conductivity of PCMs. This has, however, mostly been omitted in studies by
other researchers (Solé, et al., 2013). This method for measuring the thermal
conductivity does not work for every PCM as the PCM should have a phase change
process with a clear interface between the two phases. As most other publications after
Zhang & Jiang have not attempted to use the T-history method for thermal
conductivity measurements, except for Radhakrishnan et al. (2019), this part of the
method was omitted from the demo environment using the T-history method that was
built up in this work.
Hong et al. (2004) saw some problems in the data processing of the original method
by Zhang & Jiang. The first significant problem was the fact that the release point of
supercooling was chosen to mark the end of the phase change period, which occurs at
temperature Ts at time t2 as earlier shown in Figure 10, or marked by point a in Figure
13 (a). The degree of supercooling varies depending on conditions such as cooling
speed, purity and vibration, and it is totally independent of the end of phase change.
Therefore, Hong et al. (2004) proposed a different method for choosing the end point
of the phase change and the start of the solid-state period. In this method, the first
derivative curve of the T-history curve for the PCM is derived. Figure 13 shows typical
T-history curves for a PCM in (a) and for pure water in (b), and the derivative of the

33

T-history curve for the PCM in (c). The inflection point seen in Figure 13 (c), where
the curve reaches its minimum, is considered as the border between the phase change
and the solid-state period. The justification for this is that when the PCM is cooling,
the temperature is constant or gradually decreasing during the release of latent heat,
but the temperature decrease is exponential when only sensible heat is being released.
The difference between points a and b can be rather large, depending on the PCM that
is being studied. The second flaw in the original method is to not account for the
sensible heat during the phase change period. The decrease in temperature during this
period can be witnessed in Figure 13.

Figure 13. Typical T-history curves for a PCM with supercooling in (a), water in (b) ,
and the first derivative of the PCM’s T-history curve in (c) (Hong, et al., 2004).

To address these flaws, the equations have been modified in the method by Hong et
al. (2004). Firstly, the equations for the phase change and solid-state periods of the
PCM are modified. Equation 2.13 for the latent heat of fusion is modified to account
for the sensible heat during the phase change period, and equation 2.14 is changed to
use the temperature at the point of inflection as the beginning of the solid phase (Hong,
et al., 2004):
(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑝

𝑐𝑝,𝑙 +𝑐𝑝,𝑠
2

)(𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇𝑖 ) + 𝑚𝑝 𝐻𝑚 = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴2

2.21

34

2.22

(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑠 )(𝑇𝑖 − 𝑇𝑓 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴3
where Ti is the temperature at the inflection point.

As for the equations for the reference material, equation 2.15 remains the same while
equation 2.16 changes and an additional equation is added in (Hong, et al., 2004):
(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 )(𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇𝑖 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴′2

2.23

(𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 )(𝑇𝑖 − 𝑇𝑓 ) = ℎ𝐴𝑐 𝐴′3

2.24

For area 𝐴′1 , the range of time is from 𝑡0′ − 𝑡2′ , for 𝐴′2 , the range of time is from 𝑡1′ − 𝑡3′ ,
and for 𝐴′3 , the range of time is from 𝑡3′ − 𝑡4′ . These time points were shown earlier in
Figure 13.
By using the previous equations, the following equations are obtained for calculating
the specific heats and latent heat of fusion using the method by Hong et al. (2004):
𝑐𝑝,𝑠 =
𝑐𝑝,𝑙 =

𝐻𝑚 = − (𝑚 𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 +

2.27

where 𝐴′𝑐 is the convective heat-transfer area of the tube containing the reference. In
the original method, the heat transfer area of the tube containing the PCM should be
the same as the one with distilled water. However, as the volume of the PCM can
change between phases, this can be difficult to achieve. The modified method by Hong
et al. (2003) thus accounts for this.
The time-delay method by Marín et al. (2003) utilizes the T-history method to show
an enthalpy-temperature curve over the temperature range investigated. An enthalpytemperature curve takes into account that the composition of many PCMs are not
homogeneous and that they can have a quite wide solidification range. The enthalpytemperature curve can be obtained using equation 2.28:
𝛥ℎ𝑝 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) = (

𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 )+𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 )

where Δhp(Tint) is the enthalpy variation over a temperature range with the average
value Tint, ΔTint is the temperature range, Iint is the integral with respect to time of the
′
difference in temperature between the PCM sample and the environment and 𝐼𝑖𝑛𝑡
is
the integral with respect to time of the difference in temperature between the reference
and the environment (De Paola, et al., 2017).
The latent heat of fusion can be calculated with 𝛥ℎ𝑝 (𝑇𝑚 ) − 𝛥ℎ𝑝 (𝑇𝑖 ), using the

35

enthalpy values at the melting and inflection temperatures obtained from the method
by Hong et al. (2004). The specific heat capacity at any point along the enthalpytemperature curve can be obtained by taking the gradient of the curve at that specific
point (De Paola, et al., 2017).
Stanković and Kyriacou (2013) analyzed PCMs using the T-history method over
several heating and cooling cycles, and found out that the enthalpy values from the
first cycle were always higher than the values from the cycles following the first one.
For the first cycle, a clean sensor is placed inside the sample after which the sample is
cooled down and transformed into a solid. The possible reason for the higher values in
the first cycle is that the sensor is acting as a nucleating agent in the following cycles
because it has underwent at least one solidification process in the sample before. After
the first cooling cycle, a small amount of solid material has formed around the sensor,
which acts as a nucleating seed in the following cycles. Therefore, if a PCM is analyzed
over several cycles with the sensor immersed in the sample, the data of the first cycle
should be considered the most accurate.
Because the temperature sensors can act as a nucleating agent when immersed in the
samples, the diameter of the temperature sensors should be as small as possible.
Thermocouples are temperature sensors that are widely available with a small diameter
and for a low cost. Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are more accurate than
thermocouples, but it is not easy to find ones with a small diameter (Stanković, 2014).
For example, a class A Pt100 RTD sensor has an accuracy of ± 0.15 °C at 0 °C and ±
0.35 at 100 °C (Lapp Automaatio Oy, 2019). RTD sensors are also more expensive
than thermocouples (Smith, 2009). It was decided to use type T thermocouples in the
setup for this demo environment. Type T thewrmocouples have an uncertainty of ± 0.5
°C (RS Components Ltd., 2019).
One of the main improvements on the original setup by Zhang & Jiang, which has
been adapted by many researchers, is the use of an insulated cool down chamber for
the cooling process. In fact, many researchers use only climate chambers for both
heating and cooling the PCM, removing the water bath (Solé, et al., 2013). Removing
the water bath eliminates the errors caused by moisture on the surfaces of the test tubes.
The custom built test chamber constructed from a deep freezer by Kravvaritis et al.
(2010) had a temperature range from -30 to 120 °C, achieved through the use of electric
resistances and cooling coils. The commercial climate chamber Binder KMF 115 used
by Stanković (2014) had a temperature range of -10 °C to 100 °C. The custom-built
setup of Omaraa et al. (2017) for characterizing the thermophysical properties of
PCMs with a high melting point had a temperature range between 200 °C and 400 °C.
The setup utilized band heaters to heat up the samples.

Applications of solid-liquid PCMs

2.5.1 Thermal energy storage in buildings
In cold climate countries, about 45% of energy used in buildings is for space heating,
15% is used for water heating and 25% is used for cooking. In warm climate countries,
about 30% of energy used in buildings is for water heating, 13% for space heating and
38% for cooking (IEA, 2013). For most of these applications, low-temperature heat of
less than 100 °C is required. Therefore, solar thermal energy, for example, could be
collected for these applications, and the heat could be stored using latent heat thermal
energy storage with PCMs (Abokersh, et al., 2018).
PCMs are considered to have great potential to increase energy savings in buildings
since they can store more energy compared to conventional building materials as
shown in Figure 14. The PCM in Figure 14 was a product created by Dupont de
Nemours Society, consisting of 60% microencapsulated paraffin with a melting
temperature of about 22 °C (Kuznik, et al., 2008).

Figure 14. The maximum energy storage capacity for different materials with a
thickness of 10 mm operating in a temperature range between 18 and 26 °C for 24 h
(Kuznik, et al., 2008).

PCM applications in buildings are divided into passive and active systems. A passive
system relies on the building structure itself for the collection, storage and release of
heat. In an active system, pumps or fans are required to move a heat transfer medium.
PCMs can be used for heating or cooling a building by integrating them into building
walls, floors or ceilings/roofs. PCMs can also be placed in separate heat or cold storage
tanks located inside the house (Cui, et al., 2017). The purpose of thermal energy
storage in building envelopes is to decrease the temperature fluctuations indoors and
to delay the air temperature maximum and minimum. As an example, lightweight
buildings have low thermal energy storage capacity due to the materials used for the
envelope. By integrating PCMs into the envelope, the storage capacity can be

37

increased. The integrated PCMs can release heat during peak load periods or at the end
of the day to compensate the heating system. The PCMs are charged either during the
day by solar radiation that enters the building, or by overheating during off-peak
periods (Belz, et al., 2015).
The ventilation system of a building can have PCM to air heat exchangers integrated
into it, to allow for the storage of energy for heating and peak load shaving of the
heating system. Energy is stored during off-peak periods by passing the air that is
heated by a heat pump or an electrical system through the heat exchanger. During peak
periods, the energy stored by the PCM is released to heat the building, decreasing the
heating load that is required (Belz, et al., 2015).
PCMs can also be used in greenhouses for storing energy in active or passive systems.
The materials and their properties needed (phase change temperature, encapsulation
techniques) depend on the way the PCMs are used. In active systems, PCMs can be
used to store energy on a daily basis when combined with heat pumps or with solar
collectors. They can also be used for peak shaving when combined with seasonal
storage systems. In passive systems, they can provide passive storage with the
greenhouse covering material, and they can be used to manage the temperature of
plants and protect them from frost. Some pilot stage studies utilizing PCMs for
greenhouses with areas in the range 20–500 m2 achieved energy savings of 20–51%
(Paksoy & Beyhan, 2015).

2.5.2 Thermal energy storage in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants
In CSP plants, mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight from a large area to a small
area; the sunlight is absorbed on the small area and converted to high temperature heat
(Sarbu & Sebarchievici, 2018). The heat is stored in a heat transfer fluid (HTF). In a
CSP plant with TES, this HTF can be directly stored and pumped out at the same
temperature when discharging. This gives the highest energy and exergy efficiencies.
However, most HTFs are expensive, and therefore the majority of TES systems use a
separate inexpensive storage medium. Heat must be transferred between the storage
medium and the HTF, which requires a containment system that facilitates the heat
exchange between the HTF and the storage medium (Xu, et al., 2015). The high
temperature heat generated in CSP plants is used to generate electricity, usually
through a steam turbine connected to a generator, similar to a conventional thermal
power plant (Sarbu & Sebarchievici, 2018).
The main advantage CSP plants have over photovoltaic (PV) power plants is that
conventional fuels can be coupled with the CSP plants, and that thermal energy storage
can be used. TES allows for using energy during non-sunshine hours or smoothing the
output of the plant when the weather is cloudy, limiting the need for backup power
from fossil fuel power generation (Sarbu & Sebarchievici, 2018). The storage of

38

electrical power generated from PV panels is much more challenging than storing
thermal energy from a CSP plant and using it to generate electricity (Xu, et al., 2015).
In Figure 15, a CSP plant with a TES system is shown. There are four main types of
CSP technologies: parabolic trough collectors (PTC), parabolic dish collectors (PDC),
linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR) and solar power towers (SPT). Parabolic trough
collectors are most commonly used (Lin, et al., 2018). If PCMs were to be used for
TES in a CSP plant, PCMs with a phase change temperature of 100–300 °C would be
suitable for PTC, PDC and LFR. PCMs with a higher phase change temperature (>
400 °C) would be suitable for SPT or PDC, for which the operating temperatures reach
600 °C or 1500 °C, respectively (Pelay, et al., 2017).

Figure 15. A concentrated solar power plant with a thermal energy storage system
(Pelay, et al., 2017).

Currently, only sensible heat thermal energy storage is used for commercial
concentrated solar power plants. Table 7 shows commercial CSP plants with thermal
energy storage currently in operation with a gross capacity above 10 MW built globally
since 2010. It can be seen that only sensible heat storage with molten salt or solar salt
has been used so far to store the thermal energy generated from CSP (Xu, et al., 2015).
Solar salt is a nitrate mixture, consisting of 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3 by weight
(D’Aguanno, et al., 2018). The types of CSP used are parabolic trough collectors and
solar power towers.

PCMs are not yet used for latent heat storage in commercial CSP plants, because
research progress has to be made for the challenging techniques of heat transfer
enhancement and high temperature PCM encapsulation (Xu, et al., 2015). Heat transfer
enhancement is needed as the PCM storage materials mostly have a low thermal
conductivity. When a PCM storage is discharged, a layer of solid PCM forms on the
heat transfer surface, which gradually decreases the heat transfer rate. The heat transfer
surface can be enhanced by encapsulation of the PCM. Fin structures can be used to
increase the heat exchange surface of an embedded heat exchanger (Laing, et al.,
2013). If PCMs were to be used for thermal storage in CSP plants, the operating
temperature range would be the same at around 293 °C to 393 °C, based on the Rankine
power cycle. If the CSP plants operated at higher temperatures (>600 °C), it would
enable a higher efficiency for the energy conversion, and PCMs with higher melting
temperatures would be needed to store the thermal energy (Xu, et al., 2015). It is
predicted that solar power towers will be the most used technology in the future, and
that the proportion of parabolic dish collectors will increase, so the operating
temperatures of CSP plants could increase in the future (Pelay, et al., 2017).
A test was carried out by Laing and coworkers on a shell-and-tube prototype storage
tank embedded with seven steel tubes with aluminum fins, which used 140 kg of
NaNO3 as PCM storage media and steam as HTF. This thermal storage system was
operated for 172 cycles (over 4000 h) in the temperature range 296–316 °C. No

41

decomposition of the PCM occurred and no degradation of the finned aluminum steam
tubes took place (Laing, et al., 2011). This prototype was later scaled up in another
study to a demonstration-scale PCM storage for direct steam generation. The storage
was built in 2010 at the Endesa power plant Litoral in Carboneras, Spain. The storage
uses about 14 tons of NaNO3 as PCM. The latent heat of the PCM is used to evaporate
water. The PCM storage is coupled with two concrete storage units that store sensible
heat, which is used for preheating and superheating the water/steam. The storage
capacity of the system is 700 kWh. The system generates steam at a pressure of 110
bar and a temperature of 400 °C. The system operated successfully when tested and
showed how fins can be used to enhance the heat transfer, enabling high discharge
power despite the low thermal conductivity of PCMs (Laing, et al., 2013).

2.5.3 Passive thermal management in batteries
Due to the high energy densities of rechargeable batteries, especially lithium-ion
batteries, the demand for them is growing. Applications of batteries include electric
vehicles, portable electronics and battery powered tools (Nazir, et al., 2019). The main
obstacles for large scale adaptation of batteries for vehicles are performance, safety
and costs related to cycle and calendar life. These challenges are connected to thermal
effects in batteries. A battery pack should have an adequate rate of heat dissipation to
ensure that the battery pack does not reach thermal runaway temperatures. If the
thermal runaway temperature is reached, irreversible decomposition of the battery
takes place, damaging the electrodes and the electrolyte (Khan, et al., 2017). Higher
power demands and energy density of lithium-ion battery packs lead to higher
operating temperatures. Degradation or aging of most commercial lithium-ion battery
chemistries tend to take place at temperatures of 60 °C and above. PCMs can be used
in passive thermal management systems for the batteries to reduce the temperature rise
during discharging and charging, diminishing the performance degradation over the
lifespan of the battery and improving the safety (Nazir, et al., 2019). The PCM should
have a melting point in the range of 30–60 °C (Jaguemont, et al., 2018). Currently,
passive thermal management of batteries for stationary applications is possible. For
portable batteries, further research is required due to the restrictions posed by safety,
size and weight (Nazir, et al., 2019).
One study investigated passive thermal management using PCMs for lithium-ion
batteries, which are used in electric vehicles. A graphite matrix was filled with a
commercial PCM, and lithium-ion cells were placed and connected inside of the
module. The battery module’s performance was compared to a module without PCM.
The results showed that the capacity of the li-ion battery module with PCM could be
safely and completely utilized even under extreme temperature (45 °C) and operating
conditions (relatively high discharge rate of 10 A), and that the cycle life improved
(Al-Hallaj, et al., 2005).

42

In order to improve the low thermal conductivity of PCMs used for thermal
management in batteries, different composite PCMs have been manufactured in many
studies (Jaguemont, et al., 2018). Li et al. (2014) made a composite of copper foam
and the commercial paraffin PCM, RT 44HC and compared its performance to pure
PCM for the thermal management of a lithium-ion battery pack. The results showed
that both the composite and pure PCM operated below the safety temperature, but the
temperature of the battery with composite PCM was lower, and it had more uniform
temperature distribution (Li, et al., 2014). Rao et al. (2015) also investigated the
thermal management of a lithium-ion battery with paraffin/copper PCM. For a battery
without PCM and being discharged at a rate of 5 C, the maximum temperature of the
battery reached 89.79 °C, while the battery temperature reached only 40.89 °C for the
battery with copper/foam PCM. The batteries were also mounted into electric vehicles
and tested under road operating conditions. After a runtime of 1750 s, the maximum
and minimum temperature in the battery without PCM was 56.8 °C and 48.35 °C,
respectively, compared to 38.94 °C and 36.09 °C in the battery with paraffin/copper
PCM. It was concluded that the paraffin/copper foam thermal management system is
efficient and feasible for use in EVs (Rao, et al., 2015).

2.5.4 Solar water heating
One of the main uses of solar energy is to heat water. Solar thermal conversion is much
more efficient, with an efficiency of about 70%, compared to solar electrical direct
conversion with an efficiency of 17% (Jaisankar, et al., 2011). Hot water is needed for
residential, commercial and industrial usage. Solar water heaters are simple to
manufacture, easy to maintain and relatively cheap (Mofijur, et al., 2019). Usually, a
water tank is included in a solar water heating system to store thermal energy as
sensible heat. However, sensible heat storage systems demand a relatively large
volume and expensive insulation. The use of PCMs as latent heat storage can require
modifications to the system that are challenging and costly. As a result, studies have
been made where sensible heat storage and latent heat storage are combined in order
to benefit from both of their advantages. This can be done by placing PCM capsules
in the water TES tank. A PCM commonly used in studies on integrating PCM into a
water storage tank is paraffin wax, encapsulated in cylindrical containers made of
aluminum or copper, for example (Abokersh, et al., 2018).
An example of a solar water heating system with LHTES is given in Figure 16. This
solar water heating system consists of solar collectors, a heat storage unit with PCMs,
a heat exchanger and a water tank. During daytime, the solar collectors absorb solar
energy, heating up the water in the water tank through a heat exchanger, while the
PCM simultaneously absorbs and stores thermal energy. During the night, when there
is no sunshine, the thermal energy is taken from the PCM to heat the water (Mofijur,
et al., 2019). Depending on whether a pump is used for a solar water heating system,

43

the system can be classified as an active or a passive system (Abokersh, et al., 2018).
An active system can be either an open-loop or a closed-loop system. In an open-loop
system, the solar collectors directly heat the actual water used by the system. It is thus
only suitable for climates where freezing temperatures are not experienced. A closedloop system uses heat-transfer fluids, usually some sort of water-antifreeze mixture.
The heat-transfer fluid is pumped through a heat exchanger in the thermal storage tank
where it heats up the water used by the system (Jamar, et al., 2016).

Figure 16. Solar water heating system with latent heat thermal energy storage
(Mofijur, et al., 2019).

In a study by Canbazoğlu et al. (2005), a TES system using only a water tank for
storing sensible heat was compared against a combined sensible heat and latent heat
TES system for an open-loop solar water heating system. Both systems were studied
for two ten-day periods during November in Turkey. The water tank had a volume of
190 l, and for the study of the combined latent and sensible heat system the volume of
the PCM was 107.8 l while the remaining 82.2 l was water. The PCM used was sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate with a melting point of 48.5 °C filled in 0.44 l polyethylene
bottles and placed in the water tank as seen in Figure 17. The average water
temperature in the middle of the TES tank with PCM stayed constant at 45 °C for 10
hours during the night until the sun started charging the system again. The temperature
difference between the midpoint of the storage tank and the collector outlet was on
average 6 °C greater than for the tank without PCM. The heat storage ratio of the
system with PCMs was compared to the system without PCMs theoretically for five

44

different PCMs: zinc nitrate hexahydrate, sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, disodium
hydrogen phosphate-dodecahydrate, calcium chloride hexahydrate and sodium sulfate
decahydrate. The heat storage was 2.59–3.45 times greater compared to the system
without PCMs. It was concluded that although salt hydrate PCMs are a costlier storage
medium than water, leading to a costlier system, the higher energy density of the PCMs
reduces the size of the storage tank required, which reduces the material and insulation
material costs of the storage tank. However, due to incongruent melting of sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate, the phase change ability was lost after 25–30 cycles
(Canbazoğlu, et al., 2005).

Figure 17. The water tank combined with bottles containing PCM (Canbazoğlu, et al.,
2005).

PCMs can also be integrated into the solar collectors. Khalifa et al. (2013) integrated
paraffin wax into a solar collector as shown in Figure 18. Six copper pipes with a
diameter of 80 mm were connected into one piece, while a 42.4 kg back layer of
paraffin wax with a melting temperature of 46.7 °C placed in back of the solar collector
stores some of the heat accumulated during sunshine hours. The heat is discharged to
heat the heat-transfer fluid when the PCM cools down and solidifies during hours of
no sunshine or low sunshine. The efficiency of the system ranged between 45–54%.
The system was able to maintain the temperature of the collector for some hours after
sunset (Khalifa, et al., 2013).

back (Khalifa, et al., 2013).

2.5.5 Cold storage and refrigeration
The main research focus for PCMs used in the temperature range -20 °C to 5 °C is the
transport and the storage of products sensitive to temperature. By integrating PCMs in
food packaging, medical products and refrigerated trucks, the PCMs can improve the
thermal buffering capacity and the thermal protection of perishable products (Du, et
al., 2018).
Liu et al. (2012) developed a refrigeration system for refrigerated trucks. The system
consisted of an off-vehicle refrigeration unit and an on-vehicle thermal storage unit
with PCMs (melting point -26.7 °C). Calculations showed that the system could reduce
the energy cost by up to 86.4% compared to a conventional diesel-fueled refrigeration
unit (Liu, et al., 2012).
The use of PCMs in a freezer to improve the storage condition of frozen food was
investigated in a study by Gin & Farid (2010). The PCM used was a eutectic
composition of ammonium chloride and water, with a freezing and melting point of 15.4 °C. PCM panels were placed against the internal walls of the freezer. A freezer
containing the PCM panels and a freezer without PCM panels were subject to power
losses every 24 hours over a two-week period. The products stored in the freezers were
1 cm3 cubic blocks of bovine muscle (M. semimembranosus) meat and 1 L blocks of
ice-cream, while a block of ice was used to measure the temperature of the products.
When there was a power loss that lasted for 3 hours, a maximum peak temperature in
the products of -3 °C was reached in the freezer without PCM panels. This temperature
is 13 degrees higher than the steady state temperature of -16 °C. In the freezer
containing the PCM panels, the peak temperature reached was only -11 °C. The
measured product temperature during the power loss is displayed in Figure 19.
The PCM panels clearly helped to slow the rate of temperature increase in the products
and kept the product temperature closer to the steady state temperature. This also

46

resulted in improved preservation of the food quality. The quality of the ice cream was
investigated by measuring the ice crystal size by microscopy and image analysis
software. The ice cream had average ice crystal sizes of 40–50 µm before the
experiment was conducted. In the freezer with the PCM panels, the average ice crystal
sizes remained the same at 40–50 µm after the 2-week period of power losses. In the
freezer without PCM, the quality had been affected as the average size of ice crystals
had increased to 70–80 µm. The quality of the bovine muscle was investigated by
measuring the drip loss through centrifuging the meat samples and measuring the mass
of the liquid collected after centrifuging. The food quality of the meat was better in the
freezer with PCM panels as the drip loss after the 2 week period was 10% compared
to 17% for the freezer without PCM (Gin & Farid, 2010).

& Farid, 2010).

2.5.6 Photovoltaic-thermal
PCMs can be applied in solar PV systems, and they can help in increasing the overall
efficiency of the PV panels by cooling them down. About 5–25% of the solar energy
radiated on a typical PV panel is converted to electricity, while the remaining energy
is transformed into heat which increases the temperature of the panel. Higher operating
temperatures of PV panels negatively impact the efficiency (above the standard
operating temperature, which is usually 25 °C). The reason for the decrease in
efficiency is increased internal charge carrier recombination rates which reduce the
maximum power production capability (Kant, et al., 2016). The PV panels can be
cooled down using passive or active methods. The passive cooling of standalone PV

47

panels uses buoyancy driven air flow in a duct, while for building integrated
photovoltaics, cooling is done through buoyant circulation of air in an air channel.
When higher efficiencies are required, air cooling is carried out by forced convection
or water cooling. However, these methods also consume power (Islam, et al.,
2016).The most used PCMs in solar heating applications are calcium chloride
hexahydrate, sodium sulfate decahydrate (Glauber’s salt) and paraffin wax (Islam, et
al., 2016).
Hasan et al. (2015) compared two PV-PCM systems using different PCMs in the
different climates of Dublin, Ireland and Vehari, Pakistan. The PCMs used were a
eutectic mixture of capric acid and palmitic acid and calcium chloride hexahydrate.
The PCMs were contained in containers made of an aluminum alloy with internal fins.
The containers were attached to the back of the PV panels. The daily average increase
in power generation achieved using the eutectic mixture of capric acid and palmitic
acid was 1% in Dublin and 4.4% in Vehari compared to a PV panel without PCMs.
For calcium chloride hexahydrate, the daily average power production increased by
1.8% in Dublin and 7.7% in Vehari (Hasan, et al., 2015). In an economic analysis of
the same system by Hassan et al., it was concluded that the use of PCMs for PV panels
are not cost effective in the colder environment of Ireland, but they are cost effective
in the warmer climate of Pakistan (Hasan, et al., 2014).
Hasan et al. (2016) used the organic PCM Rubitherm RT42 to cool down a PV panel.
The PV cell’s average surface temperature dropped by 5 °C, and the PV efficiency
increased by 1.3%. Kant et al. (2016) conducted a computational fluid dynamic study
of a PV module integrated with PCM, taking into account the angle of inclination, the
convective heat transfer within the PCM and wind velocity. For a PV panel with a 2
cm thick layer of RT-35 enclosed in a 2 mm thick aluminum container attached to the
back, the model showed that the operating temperature could be lowered by up to 6 °C
and the productivity of the panel was about 5% higher (Kant, et al., 2016). Hasan et
al. (2017) compared the performance of a PV panel integrated with the Rubitherm’s
PCM RT42 to a PV panel without PCM in the hot climate of the United Arab Emirates.
The study was conducted during one year. It was concluded that the annual power
output increased by 5.9%, while at peak time the average temperature drop was 10.5
°C (Hasan, et al., 2017).
Combined PV and PCM systems are still in the development phase. There are
challenges which need to be overcome for commercialization, such as the cost, the
weight of the combined PV and PCM system and the limited quantity of PCMs
available which are suitable for the purpose (Nazir, et al., 2019). The integration of
PCM into PV panels increases the capital cost. The recovery of the additional cost
from the increase in electrical power generation depends on the climatic conditions of
the site, the PCM chosen and the design of the PV-PCM system (Hasan, et al., 2017).

48

2.5.7 Storage integrated thermophotovoltaics
In thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion processes, thermal radiation is
directly converted into electricity using photovoltaic cells. The operating temperature
is above 1000 °C. TPV has the advantage over CSP in that it does not involve any
mechanical moving parts, and thus the maintenance cost is lower (Nazir, et al., 2019).
TPV also does not require any heat transfer fluid unlike CSP (Veeraragavan, et al.,
2014). PCMs can be integrated with TPV by using the PCMs to store solar energy
collected during the day, and then using this stored heat during the night to generate
power using the TPV system. Heat-to-electricity efficiencies greater than 50% have
been reported in literature (Nazir, et al., 2019).
Silicon has been found to be the ideal PCM to be used with TPV due to its high latent
heat of fusion (1800 kJ/kg), low cost (about $1.70/kg or $0.95 MJ/kg) and it being one
of the most abundant materials on earth (Veeraragavan, et al., 2014). Compared to
CSP systems that use molten salts for energy storage, TPV systems using silicon
allows for longer operating times during periods without sunlight as only a small
amount of silicon is needed, making the systems more compact. Due to the high
melting temperature of silicon, it cannot be used in CSP systems as it would add
reliability issues to the heat transfer fluid. Veeraragavan et al. (2014) modeled the
operation of a TPV system integrated with silicon as PCM and found the average
power density during the night to be 30.86 W/cm2 with a storage duration of 7.3 h. It
is possible to have longer storage times of 3 days, but then the average power density
is lower at 14 W/cm2. The steady state system efficiency was evaluated to be around
30%.

2.5.8 PCMs in textiles
In a NASA research program in the 1980s, the technology for inserting PCMs in
textiles in order to improve the thermal performance of clothes was developed. The
purpose was to provide astronauts with additional thermal protection against the
extreme temperature fluctuations that they encounter in space. The main use of PCMs
in textiles is to regulate body temperature and improve comfort for the human body.
Thermal-regulating fibers contain PCMs that usually have a melting point between 28
and 35 °C. The PCMs incorporated in the textile fiber absorb heat when the body or
ambient temperature increases. As the PCMs absorb the heat, they change phase,
storing the heat as latent heat. When the body or the ambient temperature starts to
decrease, the heat that was stored in the fiber incorporated with PCM is released,
keeping the body within the thermal comfort zone (Nazir, et al., 2019).
PCMs have been integrated into textiles through different manufacturing processes,
including integrating microencapsulated PCMs into fibers through spinning,
integrating microencapsulated PCMs into polymer resins to electrospin thermal

49

management nanofibers, and filling hollow fibers with PCMs (Zhang, et al., 2018). An
example of a textile integrated with PCM is the microencapsulated PCM manufactured
by Zhao et al. (2016), which had n-octadecane as the core and natural silk fibroin as
the shell. The microencapsulation improved the thermal stability, and the phase change
enthalpy of the material was 88.23 kJ/kg, making it a good choice for applying in
thermal-regulating textiles (Zhao, et al., 2016). Alay et al. (2011) prepared
microcapsules with a polymethylmethacrylate shell and n-hexadecane (melting point
18.2 °C) core. The mean particle size of the microcapsules ranged from 0.22 to 1.05
µm. The microcapsules contained between 29.04% and 61.42% n-hexadecane, with
the melting enthalpies being 68.89 kJ/kg and 145.61 kJ/kg, respectively. The
microcapsules were added to cotton, cotton/polyester and microfiber polyester fabrics.
The latent heat that these fabrics incorporating PCMs could absorb were 4.95 kJ/kg,
10.02 kJ/kg and 8.38 kJ/kg, respectively (Alay, et al., 2011). Onder et al. (2008)
encapsulated paraffin waxes through complex coacervation of a gelatin and gum arabic
mixture. The coacervates were then added to fabrics by coating. The thermal
performance of the fabrics depended on the paraffin wax content in the coacervate,
and the amount of coacervate added to the fabric. For fabrics containing coacervate
percentages of 9.5–22.5%, the energy absorbing capacities were 2.5–4.5 times better
than traditional fabrics without PCMs (Onder, et al., 2008).
Textiles incorporated with PCMs have various applications, such as sportswear,
clothes for medical applications, fire retardant textiles used for gloves and suits for
firefighters, bedding and related accessories (blankets, pillows, mattress covers,
sleeping bags), automotive textiles (car interiors and seat covers), shoes, geotextiles,
agrotextiles, and space wear (Iqbal, et al., 2019).

Solar cookers

In developing countries, a significant share of the energy consumption is used for
cooking. In urban areas, fuels such as kerosene and liquid petroleum gas are normally
used, while in rural areas, firewood, agricultural waste and manure may be used. Solar
cookers can help in decreasing emissions and shortages of fuel. However, solar
cookers can only be used during the day during sunshine hours. Therefore energy
storage is needed so that solar cookers can also be used at night or during cloudy days.
PCMs can be used to store thermal energy from solar cookers (Mofijur, et al., 2019).
There are two types of solar cookers, one of which is direct type solar cookers. In direct
type solar cookers, the cooking pot is integrated with the solar collector, either in a box
type solar cooker or a concentrating solar cooker, where a concentrating mirror is
focused on the cooking pot. The other type of solar cooker is indirect type solar
cookers, for which the cooking pot is located away from the solar collector, requiring
a heat-transfer medium to transfer the heat to the cooking pot. Basically, some type of
solar collector, such as a flat plate collector, evacuated tube collector, or a

50

concentrating type collector, is coupled with the cooking pot (Muthusivagami, et al.,
2010).
In studies of solar cookers with PCM, most of the PCMs have a melting temperature
below 120 °C (Nkhonjera, et al., 2017). When using PCM as thermal energy storage
for solar cooking, the indirect mode of heating is preferred, which brings about a
temperature drop of 10–15 °C. Thus the maximum cooking surface temperature is only
100 °C, which is not enough for frying and fast cooking. Mussard & Nydal used a
mixture of the nitrate salts KNO3 and NaNO3 as PCM for a solar cooker, with the
temperature of the PCM reaching above 200 °C, allowing for faster cooking (Mussard
& Nydal, 2013). Muthusivagami et al. (2010) used the commercial PCM A-164
(melting point 164 °C) to store thermal energy for a solar cooker. The cooking unit
uses a flat surface hot plate, with oil being circulated below the finned hot plate,
keeping the temperature of the plate around 140–150 °C. However, the cost of the solar
cooker is too high due to the PCM. If the cost of the PCM was lower, the unit could
be cost efficient with long-term usage (Muthusivagami, et al., 2010).

2.5.10 Industrial waste heat (IWH) recovery
Recovery of industrial waste heat is one way to save energy and reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. Industry in the EU is responsible for roughly 26% of the final energy
consumption and for about 48% of the final CO 2 emissions. About 49% of EU
industrial heat is dissipated to the environment as waste heat, so there is great potential
to utilize this waste heat through heat recovery equipment and/or heat storage. The
global waste heat recovery market is projected to surpass $65 billion by the end of
2021 (Bianchi, et al., 2019).
The sources of IWH can be divided into two main groups. One group is the
manufacturing industry, which includes chemical industry, food processing industries,
metallic and non-metallic industries and paper industry. The other group covers other
industrial activities, such as incineration plants, power plants and vehicle engines. The
manufacturing industry has received the most research interest for IWH reuse due to
the high energy consumption of the industry. Another reason is that some of the
process and combustion temperatures are rather high in the manufacturing industry
(the higher the temperatures are, the more reuse possibilities there are as the
temperatures can be matched to more applications) (Miró, et al., 2016).
The IWH recovered can be demanded either on-site or off-site. On-site demand is
when the source of industrial waste heat and the heat demand is located on the same
site. By reusing the waste heat onsite, the energy intensity (total costs per quantity of
output product) can be decreased, leading to a reduction of energy costs and the costs
caused by CO2 emissions. Off-site is when the heat demand is not at the same location,
but located at a distance from where the industrial waste heat is generated. In this case,

51

district heating and cooling (DHC) or mobile TES (M-TES) systems are needed to
transport the IWH from the spot of generation to the location of heat demand. Whether
DHC should be used depends on if the maintenance and investment costs of the
infrastructure are high compared to the heat demand and the distance between the
source of IWH and the location of heat demand. A study estimated that the maximum
transport distance for an efficient M-TES cycle is 35 km when transported by truck,
200 km by train and three days by boat. Some studies on the feasibility of M-TES
systems have found that thermochemical storage systems are more feasible than latent
heat storage with PCMs. A PCM commonly proposed in studies for use in M-TES
systems is erythritol (Miró, et al., 2016).
A theoretical study looked at using a latent heat storage system with PCMs for IWH
recovery from a Dutch chemical manufacturing plant. The plant produces non-ionic
tensides by alkoxylation of fatty acids and alcohols. The alkoxylation reaction is
strongly exothermic, the reacting mixture is kept at a maximum temperature of about
180 °C. Most of this heat is removed to the environment by a cooling water circuit and
cooling towers. The purpose of the thermal energy storage implemented would be to
reuse the heat for preheating reactants in the next batch. The properties of the PCM
used were taken to be the same as that of a PCM with a melting temperature of 164
°C, manufactured by the company EPS ltd. However, a different melting temperature
of 140 °C was assumed to suit the process. The PCMs are contained in stainless steel
balls with a diameter of 0.10 m. The results of the evaluation showed that the energy
savings achieved using the PCM TES would be about 56%, while the payback time
would be 18 years (de Boer, et al., 2006).
Kauranen et al. (2010) studied combining an exhaust gas recovery system with PCM
latent heat storage for improving the operation of the diesel engine of a car in sub-zero
outdoor temperatures. The system was compared to an additional heater fueled by
diesel (Webasto), which is usually used at sub-zero temperatures to keep the operation
temperature of the engine at a desired operation temperature of >70 °C. 4 kg of the
commercial PCM Climsel C70 with a melting point of 75 °C was used for the heat
accumulator. The PCM was packed into stainless steel tubes in a typical shell and tube
configuration. The test results showed that the combined exhaust gas heat recovery
and latent heat accumulator system had faster response than the traditional additional
heater. The cold start emissions were also considerably smaller if the additional heater
is not started several minutes before starting the engine (Kauranen, et al., 2010).
Shon et al. (2014) carried out an experimental study, where 4.2 kg of xylitol (melting
point 93–94.5 °C) with a combined sensible and latent heat capacity of 1300 kJ for the
application’s temperature range was used as PCM to store waste heat from hot engine
coolant. The stored heat can be used to warm up the engine and heat the passenger
compartment faster. An experimental test comparing the warm-up performance
showed that the warm-up time of the engine was 33.7% shorter for the engine with
heat storage (Shon, et al., 2014).

52

2.5.11 Summary of PCM applications
From the examples of applications given in previous chapters, one can conclude that
there are a wide variety of applications for PCMs. Although commercial PCMs exist,
many of the applications are still in the research and development phase. PCMs can be
applied either in passive or active heating and cooling systems. The most common
application for PCMs is in buildings (Castell & Solé, 2015).
The choice of PCM for a certain application is made based on the requirements and
criteria given earlier in chapter 2.2. As “Thermophysical Property Data” and “Melting
and Freezing Characteristics” are two of the first properties to consider when choosing
a PCM for a latent heat storage system according to Figure 6, the T-history method
seems like a suitable choice for the demo environment. The T-history method allows
for determining these properties, which is one of the important first steps in the
development process of a latent heat storage system.
2.6

Demo environments and laboratory experiments

One of the main aims of the energy storage project that the practical part of this thesis
was conducted for, was to build a demo environment which can be used in research
and education. So it is important to understand how a demo environment can assist in
education. Laboratories are used for education in various fields, including engineering.
The aim of engineering education is for engineers to have knowledge that goes beyond
theory, and this knowledge is often obtained in the laboratory. Laboratory learning
environments give students hands-on learning experiences, in contrast to the
knowledge that is gained passively in the classroom (Lin & Tsai, 2009). Some studies
show that students have a clear preference for laboratory work (Edward, 2002), while
in other studies, there is no clear preference for laboratory work over classroom
lectures (Lin & Tsai, 2009).
The learning outcomes associated with laboratories include increasing the interest of
students, conceptual learning, advancing problem-solving and trouble-shooting skills,
enabling students to verify established theory and modeling the experiences of
professionals. Demonstrations, where the students only observe an experiment being
carried out, covers at least the learning outcomes of conceptual learning and
verification of theory. However, demonstrations lack the hands-on and troubleshooting aspects of a laboratory experiment (Vigeant, et al., 2017).
Edward (2002) points out the resource intensiveness of laboratory environments,
especially the considerable floor area that laboratories may require. As universities
may lack funds for large laboratories, scaled-down model rigs and simulations can be
used instead. Even though scaled-down models may yield different results than actual

53

equipment, this is not a problem as it just requires interpretation of results, which is an
important technical skill. It is more important that laboratory experiments are welldesigned with clear objectives.
The differences in student’s conceptual understanding after experiments and
demonstrations were compared in a study by Vigeant et al. (2017). Around 200
students in a heat transfer course were split into two groups, where one group
performed laboratory experiments and the other group watched demonstrations of the
same experiments by instructors. In both cases, the students had pre-lab prediction
questions and post-lab assessment and reflection questions that they answered. The
results showed that students who conducted the experiments in small groups received
a higher score for their conceptual understanding compared to those who watched a
demonstration of the experiment. However, the scores varied depending on the
experiment, with some experiments having a rather similar increase in score between
those who conducted the experiment and those who watched the demonstration.
Analysis of the student reflection questions gave a similar result. Overall, students who
performed the experiments gave more complete and correct answers to the reflection
questions than those who watched the demonstration, but the difference was rather
small for some experiments. The study concluded that laboratory experiments are a
better option than demonstrations, but that the difference in educational outcome was
not too large, hence demonstrations can be an attractive alternative.
A similar study was made by McKee et al. (2007), where the conceptual understanding
of students was tested before and after either viewing a demonstration or performing
a laboratory experiment. The results showed no significant difference in the conceptual
understanding for both groups of students, which points to the students learning
equally well from both the laboratory experiment and the demonstration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials and Experimental setup

Measuring the temperatures of the PCM samples and the reference requires the use of
temperature sensors and a data logger. Thermocouples were chosen as the temperature
sensor due to the requirement of a small diameter for the temperature sensors in order
to minimize their impact on the thermal profile. The thermocouple used in this study
is an RS PRO Type T (copper/constantan) grounded welded tip thermocouple, chosen
due to the small diameter (0.2 mm) of the probe. The specifications of the
thermocouple are given in Table 8.

The data logger chosen for recording the temperature is a National Instruments NI
9212 24-bits temperature input module, connected to the isothermal terminal block NI
TB-9212. The NI 9212 has 8 channels with channel-to-channel isolation, with a screw
terminal used for connecting the thermocouples. With eight channels, the maximum
amount of PCM samples that can be analyzed simultaneously is six as one sensor is
used for the distilled water reference, and the other is used to measure the temperature

55

of ambient air. The temperatures were logged using the high-resolution timing mode,
which has a sample rate of 1.8 Hz. The high-resolution timing mode optimizes
accuracy and noise while rejecting power line frequencies (National Instruments,
2019). The chassis used for the NI 9212 is the single-slot NI cDAQ-9171 data
acquisition module. The software used to record the temperature readings from the
sensors is NI DAQExpress.
The test tubes used to contain the samples and reference are from Hirschmann
Instruments. The material of the test tubes is Duran® borosilicate glass 3.3. The test
tubes are 170 mm long, with an outer diameter of 14 mm. The average specific heat
capacity of borosilicate glass 3.3 at constant pressure is 0.83 kJ/kgK for the
temperature range 20–100 °C (SCHOTT Technical Glass Solutions GmbH, 2020).
Natural rubber stoppers with a bottom diameter of 11 mm were used to seal the test
tubes containing the samples. Holes were drilled through the rubber stoppers in order
to be able to insert the thermocouples in the test tubes to measure the temperature of
the samples. As the thermocouples would not stay in place in the center of the test
tubes on their own, thin copper-plated iron rods with a length of approximately 11 cm
were used to facilitate the securing of the sensors in the test tubes. The thermocouples
were twisted around the rods until the edges as seen in Figure 20. The thermocouple
sensors were located at a depth of about 8.5 cm from the top of the test tubes.

Figure 20. Test tubes showing the thermocouples twisted around the copper-plated
iron rods.
The water bath used to heat up the samples and reference is Stuart SWB6D. It has a
capacity of 6 liters, a heater power of 350 W, a temperature range of 25 °C to 99.9 °C

56

and a temperature stability of ± 0.5 °C. The maximum working depth of the water bath
is 16 cm. The test tubes are placed in a water bath rack when heated up in the water
bath. When cooling down, the test tubes are held by clamps attached to stands. The
components of the T-history setup can be seen in Figure 21.

Figure 21. A photo of the setup for the T-history method.

Five different PCMs were studied: four salt hydrates and technical grade paraffin wax.
The reason for choosing salt hydrates and paraffin wax is their low melting
temperature, which makes them compatible with the temperature range of the Thistory setup. The PCMs were purchased from VWR Chemicals. A list of the PCMs
studied and some of their properties given by the manufacturer are shown in Table 9.
These PCMs were specifically chosen due to their low melting point. The reason for
wanting a low melting point is to decrease the temperature that the water in the water
bath has to be heated up to in order to melt the PCM, which decreases the time it takes
to conduct the measurements. Another important factor considered in selecting these
PCMs is low toxicity, to make the use of the demo environment in education safer.

57

Also, by choosing one organic PCM and four inorganic PCMs, the difference between
organic and inorganic PCMs can be observed.

The experimental procedure

The measurements performed in the experimental part of the T-history method include
measuring the mass of the test tubes, measuring the mass of the test tubes when they
contain the PCM samples and the reference, measuring the convective heat transfer
area of the samples and reference in the tubes, and the main measurement of recording
the temperature of the PCM samples and the reference during cooling. An analytical
balance Sartorius TE214S giving readings to the nearest 0.0001 g was used to measure
mass. A ruler was used to measure the height of the PCM sample and the reference in
the tubes. The convective heat transfer area of the PCM sample can be calculated as
the convective heat transfer area of a cylinder using the height of the PCM sample and
the diameter of the test tube. However, the bottom of the test tubes are slightly rounded,
they are not perfect cylinders, so the volume of the test tubes may have been slightly
overestimated. Type T thermocouples were used to measure the temperature.
The first step is to measure the mass of the test tubes. The water bath temperature is
set to the temperature T0 (50 °C for sodium sulfate decahydrate, 60 °C for disodium
hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate and 70°C for the three other PCMs) above the

58

melting point of the PCMs. The PCMs are first contained in beakers in the water bath
before they are poured into the test tubes placed in a water bath rack inside the water
bath. The PCMs were first melted in beakers due to the decrease in volume that takes
place when the PCMs melt. The beakers were not covered when heated up in the water
bath, which means that some of the water evaporated from the salt hydrates. Only
sodium sulfate decahydrate was not melted in the beakers before pouring the salt
hydrate into the test tubes. The reason for this is the two distinct layers formed caused
by incongruent melting. When sodium sulfate decahydrate is heated above the melting
point, anhydrous salt settles to the bottom, which is insoluble in the water of
crystallization. This makes it difficult to pour a homogeneous solution of the salt into
the test tube. Hence dry sodium sulfate decahydrate was filled into the test tubes
directly. After the sodium sulfate decahydrate had melted in the test tubes and the
volume had decreased, more sodium sulfate dechaydrate was added into the test tubes
for a second time.
After the samples were placed in the test tubes, the test tubes were sealed with natural
rubber stoppers, with the copper-plated iron rods and thermocouples inserted through
the holes of the rubber stoppers. A thermocouple for measuring the temperature of
ambient air was placed in a stand in the center, between the stands where the test tubes
containing the PCM samples and reference are hung up. The rack with the test tubes
is immersed in the water bath and the samples and reference are heated to some
temperature T0 above the melting point of the PCM (50 °C for sodium sulfate
decahydrate and 70°C for the four other PCMs). The water bath is covered with a
polycarbonate lid. After reaching the temperature T0, the temperatures of the samples
and reference should stabilize for a while so that they are equal. However, as the
temperature stability of the water bath is ± 0.5 °C, the temperatures never quite
stabilize.
After waiting for about 20 minutes to allow the temperature to stabilize, the rack with
the test tubes is removed from the water bath and exposed to ambient air. After that,
the tubes are hung up on separate stands using clamps. The PCM samples and the
reference are cooled down by the ambient air which has a temperature (room
temperature, about 20 °C) lower than the melting point of the PCM, T a<Tm. The
reference temperature is a temperature lower than the solidification temperature of the
PCM that can be arbitrarily chosen (Badenhorst & Cabeza, 2017). The temperature
history is recorded until the samples and reference reach Tr, the reference temperature.
The salt hydrates that required seeding (sodium sulfate decahydrate, sodium
thiosulfate pentahydrate and sodium acetate trihydrate) were manually seeded by
adding some crystal particles of their own substance from a micro spoon when their
temperatures had dropped below their melting point.
After the temperature recordings are done, the test tubes containing the samples are
placed in the water bath again in order to melt the solidified PCM so that the
thermocouples can be removed. When the PCMs have melted, the thermocouples are

59

removed, and the masses of the tubes containing the PCM samples and the reference
are measured after drying the surface of the test tubes using a paper towel. After
removing the thermocouples, some PCM might be stuck on them, which can lead to
the recorded masses being slightly lower than the actual values. Finally, the height of
the PCM samples is measured using a ruler.

3.3

Data Analysis

With the recorded data, the temperature history curves for the PCM samples, the
reference and ambient air can be compared in order to obtain the heat storage capacity
of the PCM samples during cooling. The calculations were done in Microsoft Excel.
Three different evaluation methods were used to determine the heat storage capacity.
In all methods, the trapezoidal rule for approximating integrals was used to calculate
the area under the T-history curves:
𝛥𝑥

(𝑦1 +𝑦2 )

3.1

2

where Δx is the difference along the x axis (the time measurement interval between
each temperature data point) and y1 and y2 are the temperatures of two consecutive
data points. To calculate the area for a certain temperature interval, the sum of the
individual trapezoids in the temperature range are added up.
The first evaluation method used is the original method by Zhang & Jiang (1999). The
solid and liquid specific heat capacities and the latent heat of fusion were determined
using this evaluation method, with one slight modification. Equations 2.17–2.19 were
modified to account for a difference in the heat transfer area between the sample and
reference as in the method of Hong et al. (2004), so that the volumes of the samples
do not have to be the exact same:

To estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient, equation 2.15 was used.
The second evaluation method is the one presented by Hong et al. (2004). This method
was used because it presented some improvements to the original method by Zhang &
Jiang (1999). To get the inflection temperature, the derivative of the T-history curve
was taken. However, because derivation amplifies noise, only the value for every tenth
recording was used to obtain a smoother derivative curve, so that the inflection

60

temperature would be easier to determine. Equation 2.25 was used to evaluate the solid
specific heat capacity, equation 2.26 was used to evaluate the liquid specific heat
capacity and equation 2.27 was used to evaluate the latent heat of fusion.
D’ Avignon and Kummert concluded in their study of different data evaluation variants
for the T-history method that they recommend the “time-delay” method by Márin et
al. over other methods, as the enthalpy-temperature curves satisfactorily shows the
overall enthalpy variation of a PCM depending on its temperature (Marín, et al., 2003;
D’Avignon & Kummert, 2015). Therefore, the time-delay method was also used in
this work. For the time-delay method, the enthalpies were calculated for temperature
intervals of 0.5 °C. Equation 2.28 was also modified to account for possible differences
in the convective heat transfer areas of the sample and reference, if the volume is not
exactly the same:
𝛥ℎ𝑝 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) = (

𝑚𝑤 𝑐𝑝,𝑤 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 )+𝑚𝑡 𝑐𝑝,𝑡 (𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑡 )

3.5

Equation 3.5 was used to calculate the enthalpy for temperature intervals of 0.5 °C. By
using the reference temperature as the reference point with zero enthalpy, the enthalpytemperature curve can be formed by summing the individual enthalpies of 0.5 °C
temperature increments up to the initial temperature. The latent heat of fusion was
calculated by subtracting the total enthalpy at the temperature where the phase change
ended from the total enthalpy where the phase change started. The specific heat
capacity was calculated by averaging the derivatives of the enthalpy-temperature curve
for the solid phase and liquid phase intervals. The enthalpy-temperature curves are
shown in Appendix 1.

RESULTS

During initial tests, it became apparent that three of the four salt hydrates (sodium
sulfate decahydrate, sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate and sodium acetate trihydrate)
do not undergo phase change by themselves when cooling down. The reason for this
is the supercooling property of salt hydrates (Sandnes & Rekstad, 2006). After these
salt hydrates have heated up past their melting temperature and completely melted,
they have the ability to cool down far below their melting temperature before they
undergo phase change. When the salt hydrates are supercooled, they are in a metastable
phase. A nucleation barrier prevents the spontaneous formation of the
thermodynamically stable solid phase. The temperature of the ambient air at 20 °C is
not low enough for the phase change to take place. Due to this, the method of manual
seeding in order to initiate the crystallization of PCMs described by Sandnes &
Rekstad (2006) was implemented. The crystallization of the salt hydrates is initiated
by seeding them with crystal particles of their own material after the temperature has
dropped to the freezing point of the substance.
4.1

Sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate (SoTP)

Initial tests showed that SoTP remained in liquid form and would not undergo phase
change when cooling down to room temperature due to supercooling. Hence, the
method of manual seeding was adopted in order to try to measure the thermophysical
properties of this salt hydrate. The seeding method did not work well for SoTP,
because the solidification proceeded rather slowly and unevenly. In some cases, the
solidification of the SoTP sample started from the top and proceeded downwards in
the sample. It took several minutes before the phase change region reached the sensor
and the sensor started recording this temperature change, and even longer before the
phase change process had started occurring in the whole sample. In other cases, the
sensor appeared to act as a nucleating agent, as solidification of the samples started
around the sensor before slowly proceeding to the rest of the sample. When the phase
change proceeds unevenly like this, it means that the temperature of the sample is not
uniform, which is a criteria for using the T-history method to evaluate the
thermophysical properties of PCMs. This can thus be a reason for that the method did
not work well with this salt hydrate.
The SoTP samples were subject to two heating and cooling cycles. The samples were
heated up to an initial temperature, T0, of 70 °C and cooled down to a reference
temperature, Tr, of 25 °C. The thermophysical properties obtained for four SoTP
samples from the two cycles are displayed in Table 10. It can be seen that the average
value for the latent heat, Hm, is significantly larger for all three methods in the 2nd cycle
compared to the 1st cycle. This behavior is not expected, the latent heat should not
increase with consecutive cycles. In fact, for many salt hydrates the latent heat is

62

expected to degrade with each cycle due to incongruent melting (Wada, et al., 1984;
Canbazoğlu, et al., 2005). Also, the thermocouples are more prone to act as nucleating
agents in the second cycle. The standard deviation varies from about 4% to 25% of the
latent heat value. This shows that the results are not very accurate. The average latent
heat values obtained using the methods of Zhang & Jiang (1999) and Marín et al.
(2003) were higher than the literature values. The average latent heat values obtained
using Hong et al.’s (2004) method is between the literature values. The standard
deviation for the specific heat capacity values reached almost 50% of the specific heat
values. The average melting temperature, Tm, was slightly lower than the literature
value range of 48.0–48.5 °C.
The convective heat transfer coefficient was about 18.5 W/m2K in the 1st cycle and
19.3 W/m2K in the 2nd cycle. The Biot number for distilled water was about 0.1 for the
definition of the Biot number given by equation 2.10, while it was 0.2 for the definition
of the Biot number given by equation 2.11. The thermal conductivity of SoTP for the
liquid phase in the temperature range of the samples is about 0.6 W/mK (Kenisarin &
Mahkamov, 2016), giving a Biot number of 0.11 and 0.22 for the SoTP samples.

cooling cycles. The average values and the standard deviation calculated with three
different methods are shown.

Disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DSP)

For DSP, two different experiments were performed. In one experiment, DSP was
manually seeded, and in the other, no seeding was done. Disodium hydrogen
phosphate dodecahydrate proved to change phases without manual seeding. However,
it was found to supercool to a rather low temperature of around 22–25 °C before
spontaneous nucleation took place. As the ambient air temperature is about 20 °C, this

63

does not leave much data to calculate the specific heat capacity for the solid phase.
Therefore, seeding of DSP was also attempted. When seeding, the same problem as
reported by Sandnes & Rekstad (2006) were encountered. The semi congruent melting
of DSP causes the lower hydrate, heptahydrate (∙7H2O) to form before the
dodecahydrate (∙12H2O), which results in phase segregation and incomplete phase
transition. This happened for one of two DSP samples which seeding was tested on.
The DSP samples were heated to an initial temperature T0 of 70 °C. As seen in Figure
22, the temperature of DSP sample 2 starts to increase again at about 3200 seconds in.
Attempting to evaluate the latent heat and specific heat capacity from this data would
not work well, hence no further attempts on the seeding of DSP was attempted.

Figure 22. T-history curves for seeding test on two DSP samples.

The T-history curves obtained for three parallel DSP samples without seeding are
presented in Figure 23. The DSP samples were heated up to an initial temperature of
60 °C. The three samples have differing levels of supercooling. The temperatures of
solidification, Ts, for DSP sample 1, 2 and 3 are 24.96 °C, 22.11 °C, and 23.73 °C,
respectively, while the melting temperatures, Tm, are 36.74 °C, 36.56 °C and 36.55 °C.
The melting temperature is higher than the value given by the manufacturer, but close
to the upper range of the literature values. The reference temperature, Tr, that the
samples were cooled down to before ending the measurements was 22 °C. The
derivatives of the temperature curves showed that the inflection points occur earlier
than when the temperature of solidification, T s, is reached after phase change. Due to
this, the data evaluation method by Hong et al. (2004) could not be used. The results
obtained for three DSP samples using the data evaluation methods of Zhang & Jiang
(1999) and Marín et al. (2003) and the reference values are shown in Table 11. As the

64

inflection temperature, Ti, could not be used, the solidification temperature. T s, was
instead used to mark the end of the phase transition also when evaluating with the
method of Marín et al. (2003).
The convective heat transfer coefficient was about 20 W/m2 K. The Biot number for
distilled water was about 0.11 when calculated with the definition given by equation
2.10 and 0.23 for the definition given by equation 2.11. The thermal conductivity of
DSP for the liquid phase in the temperature range of the samples is about 0.61 W/mK
(Kenisarin & Mahkamov, 2016), giving a Biot number of 0.11 and 0.23 for the DSP
samples.

Sodium sulfate decahydrate (SSD)

Five samples of SSD were subject to two heating and cooling cycles. They were heated
up to an initial temperature, T0, of 50 °C and cooled down to a reference temperature,
Tr, of 25 °C. Due to the incongruent melting of SSD, the samples started out with a
large proportion of anhydrous salt, visible as the white bottom layers in the test tubes
in Figure 24. The solidification of the liquid layer was observed to proceed slowly and
unevenly. The T-history curves of the five samples obtained from the first cycle are
shown in Figure 25. The solidification temperature, T s, occurs at about 29.5 °C, and
the melting temperature, Tm, at about 30.5 °C. The melting temperature is almost 2 °C
lower than the melting temperature of 32.4 °C provided by the manufacturer. It was
not possible to obtain any clear point of inflection from the derivative of the
temperature curve as the curve was rather flat. The inflection temperature appeared to
be almost equal to the solidification temperature, so it would not make any large
difference to use the inflection temperature instead of the solidification temperature as
the boundary for the phase change process. The phase change temperature range of
about 29.5–30.5 °C is rather narrow, and when attempting to evaluate the latent heat,
values as low as 65 and 94 kJ/kgK are obtained. Literature values for the latent heat
vary in the range of 214–245 kJ/kg (Kenisarin & Mahkamov, 2016). It was thus
concluded that the T-history method did not work well for analyzing this salt hydrate,
most likely due to its incongruent melting. The stability of SSD can be improved by
adding extra water or other additive agents so that all of the salt dissolves in the
solution, but then the thermophysical properties also change (Garg, et al., 1985).
The convective heat transfer coefficient was about 16.0 W/m2K. The thermal
conductivity for the liquid phase in the temperature range of the samples is about 0.58
W/mK. The Biot number for distilled water was about 0.09 using the definition given
by equation 2.10 and 0.18 for the definition given by equation 2.11, and the Biot
number of the DSP samples was about 0.097 for the definition given by equation 2.10
and 0.19 for the definition given by equation 2.11. With the less strict definition of the
Biot number, the distilled water and DSP samples were just below the Biot threshold
of 0.1.

Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT)

Five SAT samples were subject to two heating and cooling cycles. The samples were
heated up to an initial temperature, T i, of 70 °C, and cooled down to the reference
temperature, Tr, of 25 °C. The samples were manually seeded in order for phase change
to take place. When SAT melts, it forms some anhydrous salt and a solution containing
sodium acetate and water. When SAT was poured into the test tubes from the beaker,
some of the test tubes contained SAT with the anhydrous salt, while some had a pure
liquid solution. Seeding might not have been necessary for the samples that contained
the anhydrous salt, but all of the samples were seeded despite this. In the second cycle,
the proportion of anhydrous SAT had increased as SAT undergoes phase separation
during thermal cycling. When the samples started solidifying, the solidification
process spread rather quickly through the whole sample (within about 30 seconds).
This is good for assuming that the temperature is uniform in the sample.
The thermophysical properties obtained for the five SAT samples from the two cycles
are shown in Table 12. The average latent heat value is larger in the 2nd cycle than the
1st cycle when evaluated with the method of Marín et al. (2003) and Hong et al. (2004)
while it is smaller when evaluated with the method by Zhang & Jiang (1999). The
standard deviation for the latent heat value is above 10% of the average latent heat
value in all cases, indicating that the results are not completely consistent. The
accuracy for the specific heat capacity was not better, as the standard deviation reached
up to 25% of the specific heat capacity values. There was a remarkable gap in the value
for the specific heat capacity of the liquid phase between the two cycles when
evaluated with the method by Marín et al. (2003). The average values of the specific
heats and the latent heat all exceed the literature values, while the melting temperature
falls in the range of the literature values.
The convective heat transfer coefficient was about 20.7 W/m2K in the 1st cycle and
20.1 W/m2 K in the 2nd cycle. The Biot number of distilled water, the reference, was
about 0.11 for the definition given by equation 2.10 and 0.22 for the definition given
by equation 2.11. The thermal conductivity of SAT for the liquid phase in the
temperature range of the samples is about 0.44 W/mK (Kenisarin & Mahkamov,
2016), which gives the Biot number to be about 0.16 for the definition given by
equation 2.10 and 0.32 for the definition given by equation 2.11 in both cycles.

Paraffin wax

Five samples of paraffin wax were subject to two heating and cooling cycles. The
samples were heated up to an initial temperature, T 0, of 70 °C, and cooled down to a
reference temperature, Tr, of 25 °C. As paraffin wax is an organic PCM, it does not
undergo supercooling, so the data evaluation method is slightly different for organic
PCMs. As the temperature kept decreasing during the phase change period, the method
by Zhang & Jiang (1999) could not be used because it was difficult to locate the
boundaries for the phase change period. The method by Zhang & Jiang (1999) relies
on the temperature being almost constant during the phase change for organic PCMs.
This problem with the original method was also mentioned by Hong et al. (2004).
Solidification of the paraffin wax initiated at a temperature of about 54 °C, which is in
accordance to the data provided by the manufacturer. The thermophysical properties
obtained for the paraffin wax samples using the data evaluation methods of Marín et
al. (2003) and Hong et al. (2004) are shown in

Table 13. The values for the specific heat capacities and latent heat are rather similar
for the 1st and 2nd cycle, which is expected as paraffin waxes are chemically stable.
However, the measured values are much higher than the literature values. Despite a
large standard deviation of about 7.5–9% of the latent heat values and around 8–16%
of the specific heat capacities, the literature values are still outside of this range. The
value for the solid specific heat capacity is about double the literature value.
The convective heat transfer coefficient was about 19.7 W/m2 K for both cycles. The

69

Biot number of distilled water, the reference, was about 0.1 for the definition given by
equation 2.10 and 0.2 for the definition given by equation 2.11. Due to the high
convective heat transfer coefficient and low thermal conductivity (0.21 W/mK
(Agarwal & Sarviya, 2017)) of paraffin wax, the Biot number of paraffin wax was
about 0.33 for the definition given by equation 2.10 and 0.66 for the definition given
by equation 2.11.

DISCUSSION

Most of the results on the thermophysical properties of PCMs were rather different
from literature values, and the standard deviations of parallel test samples were large.
However, many values in literature also show significant differences, giving a rather
wide range of values for the thermophysical properties of some PCMs (Kenisarin &
Mahkamov, 2016). The reason for this may be the lack of standards for measuring the
thermophysical properties of PCMs, which leads to different methods and
configurations being used which can yield different results. However, for the setup
built in this thesis, the main issue is the large variation in results for parallel test
samples, observed by the large standard deviation.
In this demo-environment setup, the test tubes were placed in a vertical position, which
has been more common in other studies. However, some researchers have suggested
placing the test tubes in a horizontal position (Solé, et al., 2013). Peck et al. (2006)
used a horizontal test-tube setup, and the results were more accurate than their vertical
test-tube setup. However, the horizontal setup is more complicated due to the change
in volume of a PCM between phases, which leads to a vapor layer in the tube through
which heat exchange occurs. A volume control tube (E-tube) was added to control the
volume of the test tube containing the sample or reference. This improved the
accuracy, but the measurement was overly complicated. The authors then performed
measurements without the E-tube and assumed the heat transfer through the vapor
layer to be negligible, which resulted in an improvement of accuracy (Peck, et al.,
2006). The reason for using the horizontal setup is that the gravitational movements of
the solid in the liquid decrease (Solé, et al., 2013). Solid crystals might deposit to the
bottom due to buoyancy in the samples, causing a disturbance in the temperature
gradient which risks the validity of the lumped capacitance model. The presence of a
temperature gradient can cause inaccurate temperature measurements. Chiu (2013)
stated that if a temperature gradient is present, two outcomes are possible. If the
temperature sensor is located in the upper region of the sample container, the measured
temperature is an overestimate of the temperature of the sample, giving an
underestimated value for the heat capacity. If the temperature sensor is located in the
lower region, the value of the heat capacity is an overestimation.
However, Chiu’s theory about the vertical test tube setup is in contrast to the findings
by Rady et al (2010) and Hong et al. (2004). In the implementation of the T-history
method by Rady et al. (2010), three thermocouples were placed at different heights in
each test tube, and they concluded that the temperature differences along the vertical
axis of the tube are negligible. Hong et al. (2004) also concluded that the vertical
position of the temperature sensors does not affect the results, however, they found out
that the position of the temperature sensor along the horizontal axis matters in a vertical
test tube setup. For temperature sensors immersed in the sample that were located
closer to the walls of the test tube, the temperature dropped faster than temperature

71

sensors located in the center. This faster drop in temperature gave a lower latent heat
of fusion. The values obtained for the latent heat of fusion for the temperature sensors
located in the center of the tube were closer to literature values (Hong, et al., 2004).
The fact that the thermocouples may have moved and not quite stayed in the center
can be one reason for the large difference in the results. Sometimes, it looked like the
sensor was not located exactly in the center. In some tests, the sensor had been
dislocated and was touching the wall of the test tube. However, the lumped capacitance
model assumes that the temperature is uniform in the test tube. The lumped capacitance
model is just a model, the temperature is never completely uniform (Tan, et al., 2018).
But if there are large temperature differences depending on the location of the
thermocouple along the horizontal axis of the test tube, it means that the lumped
capacitance model does not hold. And in this study, it is clear that the lumped
capacitance model did not hold as the Biot number exceeded the threshold of 0.1 for
almost every PCM due to the high convective heat transfer coefficient. If the lumped
capacitance model holds, the impact that the placement of the thermocouple has on the
results should not be large.
The value of the Biot number depends on three values: the convective heat transfer
coefficient, the radius of the test tube and the thermal conductivity of the PCM. The
main reason that the Biot number exceeded the threshold is the convective heat transfer
coefficient. The samples simply cool down too fast in the ambient air of the laboratory
environment. The flow of air cannot be controlled in the space that was used for the
experiment. In an attempt to lower the convective heat transfer coefficient, the Thistory setup was moved to a fume hood. The ventilation openings of the fume hood
were sealed with cardboard and tape, and tests were performed on DSP and SAT
samples. The convective heat transfer coefficient decreased to 14.7 W/m2 K for the
DSP samples and 18.3 W/m2 K for the SAT samples. The Biot number was about 0.085
and 0.17 for the DSP samples and 0.14 and 0.29 for the SAT samples. This change in
the location of the setup thus did not help much as it only led to the Biot number falling
slightly below the threshold for the DSP samples when using the less strict definition.
It may be that the ventilation openings were not perfectly sealed so that there was still
a significant flow of air.
If a climate chamber was used, the convective heat transfer coefficient would not be
too high since the cooling rate can be controlled. But it was thought that the use of a
climate chamber would not be necessary since other studies utilizing the T-history
method, for example Hong et al. (2004) and Peck et al. (2006), successfully conducted
tests with the samples cooling down by the atmosphere. Also, a climate chamber is
much more expensive than a water bath.
If test tubes with a smaller diameter could be found, this could also decrease the Biot
number. Another method to decrease the Biot number is to insulate the test tubes (Tan,
et al., 2018). The thermal conductivities of the PCMs analyzed in other studies are

72

similar to the materials studied here. Water is also used as the reference in all studies
on PCMs in a similar temperature range, so the thermal conductivity of water which
is about 0.6–0.66 W/mK in the temperature range 20–70 °C should be sufficient. The
thermal conductivities of the salt hydrates are similar or slightly below this, so at least
the salt hydrates should not exceed the Biot number threshold of 0.1. Even though
paraffin wax has a much lower thermal conductivity of about 0.21 W/mK (Agarwal &
Sarviya, 2017), other studies have also used the T-history method for paraffin wax
(Radhakrishnan, et al., 2019) and commercial organic PCMs with similar thermal
conductivities (Stanković & Kyriacou, 2013; Hasan, et al., 2014; Tan, et al., 2018).
For example, Zhang & Jiang (1999) used test tubes with a diameter of 10.4 mm, and
used the definition for the Biot number as Biot = hcR/2k. They had a convective heat
transfer coefficient of about 5–6 W/m2 K, which satisfies the condition of Bi < 0.1
when the thermal conductivity, k, is greater than 0.2 W/mK. Hong et al. (2004) used
the stricter definition for the Biot number, Bi = hR/k, and stated that for a test tube
with an outer diameter of 10 mm and a heat transfer coefficient of 3–5 W/m2 K, the
Biot number ranges from 0.01–0.04 for inorganic hydrates with a thermal conductivity
of 0.5–2 W/mK. For organic substances with a thermal conductivity of 0.15–0.35
W/mK, the Biot number ranges from 0.06–0.13, thus the condition Bi < 0.1 is also
satisfied for many organic substances under these conditions.
In this demo environment setup, test tubes made of glass were used. Glass test tubes
are often used in other studies as well. The reason for using glass is that it is chemically
inert, so no chemical interactions occur between the PCM and the sample holder
material. However, using glass as the material for the sample holder is not without its
downsides. The low thermal conductivity of glass does not support the lumped
capacitance assumption. Also, the temperature sensor for measuring the temperature
of the sample and the reference cannot be placed outside on the walls of the sample
holders. Instead, the temperature sensor is usually immersed in the middle of the
sample holder (Tan, et al., 2017). Other materials that have been used for the sample
containers are stainless steel (Gunasekara, et al., 2016; Omaraa, et al., 2017; Huang,
et al., 2018), aluminum oxide (Omaraa, et al., 2017), polyethylene (Peck, et al., 2006;
Buttitta, et al., 2015), polypropylene (Jansone, et al., 2018), and copper (Tan, et al.,
2018).
The water bath has a temperature stability of ± 0.5 °C, and it is not a circulating water
bath. This might be the reason why the samples are not at the same temperature from
the start of the cooling process. A circulating water bath with better temperature
stability could improve the temperature uniformity among the samples. But then there
is also the issue of the accuracy of the temperature sensors. The difference in
temperature between the samples at the start could also be due to the accuracy of the
temperature sensors. The differences in the values of latent heat and specific heat
capacity could also be due to the accuracy of the thermocouples. Type T
thermocouples were used as they are the most accurate thermocouples, with an

73

uncertainty of ± 0.5 °C (RS Components Ltd., 2019). Other T-history method setups
have used type K thermocouples (Peck, et al., 2006; Stanković, 2014; Omaraa, et al.,
2017; Jansone, et al., 2018; B.V. & Gumtapure, 2019), type T thermocouples (Rady,
et al., 2010; Buttitta, et al., 2015; D’Avignon & Kummert, 2015; Gunasekara, et al.,
2016; Huang, et al., 2018), thermistors (Stanković & Kyriacou, 2013; Tan, et al., 2018)
and PT100 RTDs (Sandnes & Rekstad, 2006; Gschwander, et al., 2011; De Paola, et
al., 2017). As thermistors and PT100 RTDs are more accurate temperature sensors, the
use of these could have improved the accuracy of the results.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A demo environment on PCMs was built up at the Technobotnia research and
development laboratory. The T-history method which is used for determining the
thermophysical properties of PCMs, such as the latent heat of fusion, specific heat
capacities and melting temperature, was chosen to be implemented as the demo
environment. The method was tested on five different PCMs: four salt hydrates and
paraffin wax.
From the tests, it was concluded that the method did not function optimally according
to instructions from literature. The values obtained for the thermophysical properties
of parallel samples of the PCMs mostly had large standard deviations, indicating poor
repeatability of the results. Some of the measured thermophysical properties agreed
with literature values, while some differed. For some PCMs, there is also a large
difference in literature values for thermophysical properties. This may be due to the
lack of standards for determining thermophysical properties, leading to different
methods and configurations being used, which can give different results.
The main reason for the poor repeatability of the results may be that the convective
heat transfer coefficient was too high. The convective heat transfer coefficient reached
about 20 W/m2 K in most experiments, which is significantly higher compared to other
studies which have reported convective heat transfer coefficients between 3 and 6
W/m2 K. The greater the convective heat transfer coefficient is, the greater the Biot
number is. This lead to the Biot number being greater than 0.1 in most cases, which is
considered as a threshold for being able to assume that the temperature distribution
inside a sample is uniform. This is one of the main assumptions that the T-history
method is based on, so if this requirement is not met, it is a likely explanation for the
method not working.
Another issue is that three of the four salt hydrates would not self-nucleate in the
temperature range used in this setup due to their supercooling property. This required
these salt hydrates to be seeded with crystal particles of their own substance. But for
two of these salt hydrates, the solidification process proceeded rather slowly and
unevenly, as the sample started solidifying locally in some place before slowly
proceeding towards the rest of the sample. Because of this, the temperature distribution
within the sample is uneven.
In order to obtain better results for the thermophysical properties of the PCMs, a
climate chamber could be used to control the temperature during both heating and
cooling of the PCMs. The use of a climate chamber is common in many recent studies
which have used the T-history method. Insulation of the test tubes is another method
to reduce the convective heat transfer coefficient. Further studies could also look at
improving the characteristics of the PCMs tested in this study by adding various
additives to them, in order to make them more viable options for energy storage.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING – SWEDISH SUMMARY
Utvecklande av en demomiljö kring fasändringsmaterial
Inledning
Global efterfrågan på energi kommer fortsätta att öka även i framtiden på grund av
ekonomisk tillväxt och en ökande befolkningsmängd. Samtidigt har Parisavtalet, som
undertecknats av de flesta länder, som mål att begränsa den globala
temperaturökningen till under 2 °C och sträva efter att begränsa den till 1,5 °C. Detta
utgör en utmaning för det globala energisystemet: det behövs mera energi och mindre
kol. En större andel av energin måste komma från förnybara energikällor för att minska
kolavtrycket.
På grund av den intermittenta naturen hos många förnybara energikällor är det
problematiskt att matcha utbud och efterfrågan på energi. Energi från förnybara
energikällor produceras bara när det finns tillräckligt med sol eller vind. För att kunna
ta i bruk en större mängd förnybar energi behövs energilagring. Det finns en mängd
olika typer av sätt att lagra energi, och termisk energilagring är en av dem. Termisk
energilagring är ett effektivt sätt att lagra energi, och då är det närmast frågan om
solenergi, industriell spillvärme och energi från kraftvärme och avfallsförbränning.
Den latenta värmen som frigörs när fasändringsmaterial ändrar fas kan användas för
att lagra termisk energi. Mängden forskning kring termisk energilagring med
fasändringsmaterial ökar snabbt.
Den praktiska delen av detta diplomarbete gjordes som en del av ett forskningsprojekt
om energilagring där Åbo Akademi, Yrkeshögskolan Novia och Vasa Yrkeshögskola
samarbetar. Ett av de centrala målen i detta projekt var att skapa en demomiljö kring
energilagring som kan användas för kompetensutveckling. Behovet av
kompetensutveckling drivs av ett ökande behov av energilagring som speciellt märks
i Vasaregionens energikluster. Demomiljön bör möjliggöra kompetensutveckling för
studerande, lärare, forskningspersonal och företag. Det här diplomarbetet bidrog till
projektet genom att bygga en del av demomiljön.
Syfte
På grund av det ökande forskningsintresset för fasändringsmaterial, och många
möjliga tillämpningar för fasändringsmaterial, bestämdes det att en del av demomiljön
skulle behandla fasändringsmaterial. För att hitta idéer för hur demomiljön kunde
byggas upp gjordes först en litteraturstudie angående fasändringsmaterialens
egenskaper och tillämpningar. Efter litteraturstudien gjordes det praktiska arbetet för
att bygga upp demomiljön. Som metod för demomiljön valdes Temperature historymetoden, T-history, en metod som används för att karakterisera termodynamiska
egenskaper hos fasändringsmaterial som latent värme, specifik värmekapacitet,

76

smälttemperatur och mängden underkylning. En anordning för T-history-metoden
byggdes upp och testades vid forskningslaboratoriet Technobotnia.
Förutom T-history-metoden finns det andra metoder för att mäta termofysiska
egenskaper hos fasändringsmaterial. Man kan använda sig av differentialtermisk
analys eller differentialtermisk svepkalorimetri. Utrustningen som behövs för dessa
metoder är mycket dyrare än den som behövs för T-history-metoden. Utrustningen är
också mera komplex att använda, vilket kräver utbildad personal. Utrustningen som
behövs för T-history-metoden är mycket enklare att använda och billigare, vilket är
orsaken till att den valdes.
Metod och material
Då T-history-metoden tillämpas fylls en eller flera prover av fasändringsmaterial upp
i provrör, medan ett provrör fylls med en referens. Referensen som väljs har välkända
termofysiska egenskaper. Proven och referensen värms upp till en temperatur som är
högre än fasändringsmaterialens smältpunkt. Sedan exponeras proven och referensen
för en omgivning vars temperatur är lägre än fasändringsmaterialens smältpunkt.
Temperaturen på proven och referensen mäts när de kallnar, även omgivningens
temperatur mäts. När proven kallnar ändrar de fas, medan referensen inte ändrar fas.
Från temperaturmätningarna får man ut så kallade T-history-kurvor. Provens och
referensens kurvor kan jämföras för att räkna ut fasändringsmaterialens termofysiska
egenskaper.
T-history-metoden baserar på två viktiga antaganden. Det första antagandet är att
värmeflödet från referensen till omgivningen och från provet till omgivningen är lika
stora när referensen och provet har samma temperatur. Det andra viktiga antagandet
är att temperaturfördelningen är likformig i behållarna i samtliga provrör. I
verkligheten är temperaturen inte helt likformigt fördelad, det förekommer alltid en
temperaturgradient. För att kunna anta att temperaturfördelningen är likformig bör
biottalet vara lägre än 0,1. Biottalet räknas ut genom att multiplicera den konvektiva
värmeöverföringskoefficienten med provrörets karakteristiska längd och dela med
fasändringsmaterialets termiska konduktivitet. I en mindre sträng version av att räkna
ut biottalet multipliceras den termiska konduktiviteten med två.
För T-history-metoden finns det olika databehandlingsmetoder för att räkna ut de
termodynamiska egenskaperna latent värme och specifik värmekapacitet. Tre olika
databehandlingsmetoder användes i detta arbete. En av dem är den ursprungliga Thistory-metoden som introducerades av Zhang och Jiang (1999). Den andra metoden
som användes introducerades av Hong et al. (2004) och är rätt lik den ursprungliga.
Den tredje metoden av Marín et al. (2003) är lite annorlunda, istället för att jämföra
ytorna under T-history-kurvorna som i de två andra metoderna ritar man upp en
entalpi-temperaturkurva.
För föreliggande arbete användes ett vattenbad för att värma upp fasändringsproven

77

och referensen. Med ett vattenbad kan fasändringsmaterial med en smältpunkt mellan
rumstemperatur och under 100 °C analyseras. Destillerat vatten användes som referens
eftersom dess termofysiska egenskaper är välkända och den inte undergår fasändring
i denna temperaturintervall. Som behållare för proven och referensen användes provrör
av borosilikatglas som stängs med gummiproppar. Som temperaturgivare användes
termoelement av typ T som placerades in i mitten av provröret. Termoelementen
kopplades in till en NI 9212-datalogger med ett isotermiskt terminalblock NI TB-9212.
Programmet NI DAQExpress användes för att mäta och spara temperaturdata. En
analytisk våg med en noggrannhet på 0,0001 g användes för att väga proven och
referensen. Höjden på proven och referensen i provrören som användes för att räkna
ut den konvektiva värmeöverföringsytan mättes med en linjal.
T-history-metoden testades på fem olika fasändringsmaterial inhandlade från VWR
Chemicals. Fyra av dessa var olika salthydrater som är oorganiska
fasändringsmaterial: natriumsulfatdekahydrat, dinatriumvätefosfatdodekahydrat,
natriumtiosulfatpentahydrat och natriumacetattrihydrat. Det femte var paraffinvax, ett
organiskt fasändringsmaterial. Eftersom salthydraterna kan underkylas många grader
under deras frystemperatur innan de byter fas, så räckte temperaturvidden inte till för
dem. Endast dinatriumvätefosfatdodekahydrat byter fas ovanför en rumstemperatur på
20 °C. För att de andra salthydraterna skulle byta fas lades en kärna av deras egna torra
substans i efter att deras temperatur sjunkit under frystemperaturen.
Resultat och diskussion
När flera parallella prover av samma fasändringsmaterial mättes var det stor variation
i resultaten, vilket fick dem att verka slumpmässiga och icke reproducerbara. Ett
tecken på att resultaten inte är så bra ficks då proverna på fasändringsmaterialen
utsattes för två cyklar där de värmdes upp och kyldes ner. När fasändringsmaterial
utsätts för flera cyklar där de värms upp och kyls ner, så borde den latenta värmen och
den totala entalpin i dem inte öka. För många salthydrater borde värdena egentligen
börja minska eftersom de smälter inkongruent. Men när salthydraterna utsattes för två
konsekutiva cyklar så steg den latenta värmen och entalpin för de flesta prover.
Medeltalen för den latenta värmen och den totala entalpin var högre för den andra
cykeln än den första.
En del av de termofysiska egenskaperna som mättes verkade stämma överens med
litteraturvärden, medan vissa skiljde sig. Men i litteraturen finns det även rätt olika
värden för egenskaperna hos många fasändringsmaterial. Det kan bero på att olika
metoder använts för att mäta egenskaperna hos fasändringsmaterialen, och att det inte
finns standarder för att mäta termofysiska egenskaper i fasändringsmaterial.
En enkel förklaring till att metoden inte fungerade bra är att biottalet överskred gränsen
på 0,1. När biottalet överskrids så håller inte antagandet att temperaturen är likvärdig
i provet. Orsaken till att biottalet överskreds kan vara att den konvektiva
värmeöverföringskoefficienten var för hög då den närmade sig 20 W/m2 K. Det här kan

78

jämföras med ett värde mellan 5 och 6 W/m2 K för Zhang och Jiang (1999). Att bara
ha proven och referensen att kylas ner i en öppen plats vid rumstemperatur verkade
inte fungera i detta fall, fast det nog gjorts i några andra studier som använt sig av Thistory-metoden.
I framtiden kunde man försöka få bättre resultat genom att använda en klimatkammare
för att styra temperaturen på proven och referensen. Med klimatkammaren kan man
styra temperaturen så att den konvektiva värmeöverföringskoefficienten inte blir för
hög. Att använda en klimatkammare för att styra temperaturen har varit vanligt i färska
studier där man använt T-history-metoden. Dessutom kunde man försöka ändra
fasändringsmaterialens egenskaper genom att lägga till olika tillsatsämnen för att få
mera livskraftiga alternativ till energilagring.
