Abstract
Aim: The study was intended to investigate working life in a sample of children in
Bangladesh.
Method: A questionnaire was completed by 150 working children (46 girls, 104 boys). The
mean age was 12.6 years (SD = 2.4) for girls, and 12.3 (SD = 2.0) for boys.
Results: For girls, the average number of years of education was 2.7 (SD 2.0) and for boys
it was 2.6 (SD 1.8). The differences between girls and boys regarding reading and writing
skills were not significant. For girls, the number of working hours per day varied between
five and fourteen, 63.1% worked between eight and ten hours per day. For boys, the number
of working hours varied between six and sixteen per day, 32.7% worked ten hours per day.
The most common occupations of the girls were cleaning, household chores, and garment
work, and the most common occupation of boys was selling things. The work environment
of the girls was hot, dirty, and polluted, and some girls had to walk long distances, while
others worked in noisy congested factories. The work environment of the boys was mostly
dangerous and unsafe, unhealthy, polluted, dusty, and crowded. Girls scored significantly
higher than boys on avoiding behaviours. No significant sex difference was found for
diseases and health problems or maltreatment at work. Maltreatment at work correlated
significantly with diseases and health problems.
Conclusions: The children in the sample had a low level of education. They worked
extremely long days. The work environment was very poor for both girls and boys.
Keywords: working children, Bangladesh, working hours, work environment, education

1. Introduction
1.1 Aim of the Study
The study investigates working life in a sample of children in Bangladesh. It describes the level of
education of the working children, their reading and writing skills, their working environment, their
daily working hours, the occupations of girls and boys, maltreatment at work, diseases and other
health problems.

1.2 Historical Background of Child Labour
Childhood is a crucial time for development as rapid growth happens in this stage that includes
physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional development. Bornstein et al. (2012) compared this process
with building blocks which may impact later growth. These multiple stages are interlinked (Elder Jr
& Shanahan, 2007). For instance, a balanced diet during the early years is necessary for children’s
healthy physical construction and enhances cognitive and socio-emotional growth (Currie, 2000;
Leavitt, Tonniges, & Rogers, 2003). In developed countries, child health status is quite satisfactory
according to the multistage development, whereas in less developed countries, it is not pleasing
(Currie, 2000; Williams et al., 2004). Due to lack of population control and an unequal distribution
of wealth, children are forced into uneven growth (Humphrey, 2009; Lichter, 1997; Solomons,
Mazariegos, Brown, & Klasing, 1993; Wolfe & Behrman, 1982). After the mid-twentieth century,
several international organizations approached to assist these countries in terms of child development,
and some of them also introduced child right laws (Myers, 1992; Woll, 2001). For instance, the United
Nations Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC,1990) is a treaty which proclaims the civil,
political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children.
In addition, child labour can be considered a consequence of uneven growth (Grootaert & Kanbur,
1995; Manzo, 2005). Historically, child labour incidents were very common. However, after the
nineteenth century the child labour ratio declined, and in the twentieth century, most of the developed
countries almost completely overcame this situation (Cunningham & Viazzo, 1996). For example, in
Italy the percentage of child labour of children between 10 and 14 years of age had declined from
below 70% to below 5% in the period of 1881 to 1961 (Toniolo & Vecchi, 2007). Contrarily, in the
United Stated of America, the child labour slowed down from 11.66% to 2.46% in the period of 1890
to 1930 (Long, 1958). On the other hand, in the United Kingdom, the child labour declined from 36.6
% to 18.3% (Cunningham & Viazzo, 1996) from 1851 to 1911. In addition, according to International
Labor Organization (ILO) the world child labour declined from 16% to 10.6% between 2000 and
1

Jahanara Simu

2012 (ILO-IPEC, 2013). However, after the Second World War (WW II) several countries achieved
independence and achieved third world status. The scenario of child labour in these countries is not
equal to the so called first world countries. For instance, in Somalia, 1,012,863 (39.8%) of the children
between five and 14 years are child labourers, whereas in Pakistan 13% of the children are child
labourers (Nag, 2019). Over 200 million child labourers have been identified over the past few
decades and most of them are found in Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asian countries (The World
Counts, 2014).
The commercialisation of children began with the Industrial Revolution (Humphries, 2010).
Because of the industrialisation, children were forced to work in family farms, in factories, in tending
crops or in food preparation. The industry required labour and the capitalists required cheap labour
and children were the best option for cheap labour. Now children perform dangerous and deadly
work, not only in the industry, but also in homes and in marketplaces (Basu, 1999). In the
contemporary society, poverty forces children to engage in the work force. Thus, child labour is a
matter of development both in the national and international sphere. The developed nations have
overcome this state, but developing countries, for example Bangladesh, is fronting this problem till
now, as a development challenge because the problem is due to rapid population growth, high rates
of unemployment, inflation, poverty, malnutrition, bad leadership, corruption, and low wages (Bass,
2004).
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO, 2002), child labour is defined as “the
work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to
physical and mental development”. The National Child Labor Elimination Policy (2010) defines a
child labourer in the Bangladesh Labor Act (2006) as a person who has attained the age of 14 but is
below the age of 18. However, in Bangladesh, it is impossible for a poor parent, especially when
trapped into persistent poverty, to keep his children safe. Subsequently, many children start selling
their labour as workers in hotels, restaurants, factories, workshops, and as domestic workers. They
are also engaged in loading and carrying at the market, they work as potters, beggar, rickshaw puller,
puller of hand carts and so on (Ministry of Labour and Employment, 2010). Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (2017) has estimated that 3,450,369 children are working children, and among them
1,280,195 children are involved in hazardous child labour. These children are faced with dismal,
deplorable and abject working conditions, unfixed wages, health hazards, lack of recreation, and they
are exposed to mental, physical and sexual harassment (Aktar & Abdullah, 2013).

1.3 Child Right Protecting Instruments
Child labour is as a global phenomenon which is a result of poverty and lack of education. Many
National and International organisations work to protect the children. Several programs to protect the
child labourers have been launched, for example, the instruments of ILO (2014) entitled the Cash and
In-kind Transfer Programme, the Public Employment Programme, social health protection, maternity
benefits, social protection for people with disabilities and those who suffer from employment-related
injuries or diseases, income security in old age, and unemployment protection. According to ILO
(2014), lack of social protection is the main cause behind child labour. The ILO’s child labour
protection was designed by a social protection activity (ILO, 2014). Similarly, the World Bank (WB)
has focused on increasing primary education enrolment and decreasing child labour (Betcherman,
Fares, Luinstra, & Prouty, 2004). The World Bank provides loans and policy recommendations, for
instance, improving incentives for children to go to school, removing constraints stopping children
from going to school, using legislation to encourage schooling and discouraging child labour
(Betcherman et al., 2004). In addition, a special policy recommendation for child labour provides
protection and rehabilitation services for working children including removal of children from
hazardous and the worst forms of child labour, enforcing health and safety and other employment
standards, providing access to education and health services, vocational training and other
rehabilitation services (Betcherman et al., 2004). Similarly, the UNICEF (2014) works for the child
labour elimination with multiple actors both the national and international donors, and the civil
society. At a national level UNICEF (2014) assists in developing a policy to protect child labourers.
Several international programmes have undertaken to end child labour. One of the largest
programmes was The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC 1992) which
operated in 88 countries. The programme collaborated with international and government agencies,
NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with
education and assistance (ILO, 2019c). Conferences were also organised to identify the obstacles and
to assess progress. These conferences were in Oslo (1997), the Hague (2010), Brasil (2013), and
Buenos Aires (2017) (Betcherman et al., 2004; ILO, 2019a, 2019b, 2019d).
In Bangladesh, a different type of legislative and policy work has been done to eliminate child
labour in accordance with the suggestion of international agencies. Aktar and Abdullah (2013) have
critically discussed the protecting instruments of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh’s constitution, the
Articles 14 and 15 of the constitution stipulate the rights of children and the right to social security.
Articles 17, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 partially or directly forbid the forced labour
(Aktar & Abdullah, 2013). However, there are strong domestic laws on national child labour
3

Jahanara Simu

elimination policy (2010). These are the Bangladesh Labour Act (2006), the Children’s Act (1933),
the Employment of Children Act (1938), the Tea Plantation Ordinance (1962), and the Mines Act
(1923) (Aktar & Abdullah, 2013). International agreements have also been signed for example, the
ILO minimum age convention 138 (C138) (1973), the UN convention on the rights of the child (CRC)
(1990), and the ILO child labour convention 182 (C182) (1999) (Aktar & Abdullah, 2013). These
instruments work well to eliminate child labour nationally and globally, but they are not working as
fast as needed.

1.4 Global Child Labour
Currently the world has more than 200 million child labourers, of them 120 million are engaged in
hazardous work, and about 73 million children are below 10 years old. The Sub-Saharan Africa has
the highest number of child labourers (The World Counts, 2014). These children engage mostly in
cocoa, coffee, cotton, rubber and other crops. About 20 million child workers are also employed in
factories or industrial productions, e.g., garments, carpets, toys, matches and hand-rolled cigarettes.
In addition, over the last decade the number of children in armed conflicts has risen to 300,000 (The
World Counts, 2014).
Nag (2019) has presented the top ten countries where the situation of child labour is the worst. In
Somalia, it had been estimated that 1,012,863 (39.8%) children between five and 14 are found to be
child labourers. Most of the children in Somalia engage in both agriculture, construction, mining and
even in armed conflicts and anti-national activities due to lack of social, economic and political
security (Nag, 2019). In Pakistan 13% of the children work as child labourers, and of them, 76% work
in agricultural sectors. A large number of children are also found in restaurants, tea stalls,
transportation, garbage scavenging, and risky industries. According to the International Labor
Organization, 17.2% of the population live below the poverty line in Pakistan, which forces the
children to do work. Nigeria, an African country on the Gulf of Guinea, suffers from a different
situation of child labour. In this country girls are more vulnerable than boys (Adepoju, 2005; Nag,
2019). Most of the girl children engage in domestic work from a very early age. Instead of attending
school, both girls and boys are involved in agricultural work, street hawking and street begging,
mining and construction work, shoe shining, car washing, auto repair, conducting minibuses, and
numerous other activities. Overall 15 million Nigerian child workers are below the age of 14 (Nag,
2019).
Poverty has forced about 1.5 million children aged between 10 and 17 to be involved in agriculture
and small craft industry in Myanmar (Nag, 2019). Due to lack of a labour law and injustice, Liberian
4

Jahanara Simu

children have been engaged in the labour force. About 30% of the children in Liberia are child
labourers (Nag, 2019). Furthermore, India, the second most populated country in the world, has 33
million child labourers (Nag, 2019). Unlike other countries, the growing economy of India has pushed
the child labourers from rural to urban areas. Nag (2019) mentions that despite governmental
initiatives, the child labour ratio in Ethiopia has not decreased. Half of the Ethiopian children found
in the labour force were brought from underdeveloped regions to Addis Ababa to do shoe shining,
vending, mining, and even unpaid labour. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, children are
forced to work in gold, wolframite, and coltan mines. In addition, armed force engagement and sexual
exploitation also exist in eastern Congo. In Congo, 3,327,806 children work as child labourers. Invalid
birth registration and lack of citizenship proof force children into child labour (Nag, 2019). In Chad,
most school-aged children are found in the agricultural sector or trafficked into oil producing
countries. Despite poverty, the adverse impact of climate change has forced children into the labour
force (Nag, 2019).

1.5 Child Labour in Bangladesh
Studies on value statements have examined the poor health condition, the working environment,
working hour and salary of child labourers. A study (2000) has shown that about 5.4–7.9 million
children work as child labourers, and most of them are involved in the agricultural sector in order to
contribute to their family income (Salmon, 2005). Similarly, a cross sectional study has found that
89% of the children were involved in the labour force to support their families (Rahman & Hakim,
2016). Another study has shown that children were not only involved in the agriculture sector, but
also in industrial and manufacturing plants, small scale factories, metal works, construction, and in
many other different activities (Uddin, Hamiduzzaman, & Gunter, 2009). A survey in Sylhet found
that the child workers suffered from many physical and psychological problems, and that they
received medical assistance from local non-qualified persons (Uddin et al., 2009). Another study of
Kamruzzaman (2015) found the worst victimization of child labourers at workplaces in Bangladesh.
This study also presented that common physical assault included beating (13%), pulling hair (7.5%),
and sexual abuse, including rape (14.1%) and sexual perversions (16.5%).
Unlike the above, a report of the ILO (2006) presented that there were approximately two million
domestic child labourers in Bangladesh. Apart from this report, few other studies have shown that
domestic child labour includes physical, mental, and even sexual abuse by employers (Islam, 2010;
Kamruzzaman & Hakim, 2016, 2018; Kamruzzaman et al., 2016). In some cases, domestic workers
have even died because of severe torture and injury. They were tortured for simple reasons, for
5

Jahanara Simu

example, for not performing in their duty properly, delay in work, or simply breaking a glass (Islam,
2010; Islam, 2013). Physical aggression included slapping, kicking, punching, beating, hitting the
head against the wall, burning with cigarettes or metal stuff, and non-payment of salary. Girls are
often victimized from sexual abuse by male members of their households (Islam, 2013;
Kamruzzaman, 2015; Kamruzzaman & Hakim, 2016, 2018; Kamruzzaman et al., 2016).
Child labourers in Bangladesh work more than eight hours a day (Kamruzzaman, 2015).
Kamruzzaman (2015) has shown that 42.4% of the respondents worked 5-8 hours per day, and that
30% of the children worked more than eight hours. Hakim and Talukder (2016) made a quantitative
study of street children by random sampling in Tangail. They found that 85.5% of the children had
three meals a day and 14.55% had meals twice a day. They also found that 85.3% of the children
washed their hands before eating, and 57.5% took a bath daily. Furthermore, they found that 66.67%
of the respondents were underweight and that 59.8% of them had suffered from diseases in the last
three months prior to the study (Hakim & Talukder, 2016). Similarly, Hakim and Rahman (2016)
analysed the effect of child labour on child health in Bangladesh. They found that 60.42% were
underweight, 6.25% were overweight, and 63.75% had three meals per day. Furthermore, the hygiene
of the children was not good.
The educational level of child labourers is also low in Bangladesh (Islam, 2010). A study by Islam
(2010) showed that domestic child labourers failed to obtain a formal education, and only79.2%
received a non-formal education because of the poverty. In addition, he found that 73.3% did not
have a full day off during the week, 21.7% received only three to four hours rest, and 19.2% did not
get any rest during the day. Rahman, Hakim, Hanif, Islam, and Kamruzzaman (2016) provided a link
between health and educational background of child labourers in Dhaka and Chittagong city in
Bangladesh. They found that 37.3% were malnourished. They found no link between the educational
level and malnourishment. Some child labourers worked for low payment and sometimes only for
food (Sumon, 2007). Of the children 45% received a fixed salary (Rahman & Hakim, 2016).
Salmon (2005) and Rahman and Hakim (2016) found that most child labourers were engaged in
agriculture. However, Uddin et al. (2009) showed that they were not only involved in agriculture, but
also in other sectors. Similar to Uddin et al. (2009), Kamruzzaman (2015) also found high
victimization of child labourers at workplaces in Bangladesh. Unlike them, Islam (2010),
Kamruzzaman and Hakim (2016), and Kamruzzaman et al. (2016) found that domestic child labourers
were frequently physically, mentally and sexually abused by their employers. Kamruzzaman (2015),
Hakim and Talukder (2016), and Hakim and Rahman (2016) used quantitative methods. They found
a relationship between working hours, diet and health. Islam (2010) and Rahman et al. (2016) found
a relationship between poverty, educational level and health. However, different national and
6

Jahanara Simu

international organizations have adopted different types of instruments to abolish and protect child
labourers in Bangladesh. One of them is The National Child Labor Elimination Policy (2010).

1.6 Research Questions
The following research queries were investigated:
1. Number of years of education of working children
2. Differences between girls and boys regarding their reading and writing skills
3. Working hours of girls and boys.
4. The most common occupations of girls and boys.
5. The work environment of the girls and boys.
6. The sex difference for diseases and health problems and maltreatment at work.
7. The relationship between maltreatment at work and diseases and health problems.

2. Method
2.1 Sample
A questionnaire was completed by 150 working children, 46 girls and 104 boys living in five districts;
Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Barisal, Sylhet. The age range of the respondents was between seven
and 16 years. The mean age was 12.6 years (SD = 2.4) for girls, and 12.3 (SD = 2.0) for boys, the age
difference not significant [t(148) = 0.76, p = ns]. Of the respondents, 86.7% were Muslims, 10.7%
were Hindus, 1.3% were Buddhist, and 0.7% something else.
Number of years of school attendance are presented in Table 1. Of the respondents 15.3% had no
education at all, while the maximum number of years at school in the sample was seven (2%). For
girls the average number of years of education was 2.7 years (SD 2.0) and for boys it was 2.6 years
(SD 1.8). The sex difference was not significant.

2.2 The Instrument
The questionnaire included scales for measuring diseases or health problems of the children (4 items,
α .75), maltreatment at work (6 items, α .74), and avoiding behaviours (3 items, α .85).
Avoiding behaviours were observed by the researcher while interviewing the children. All response
alternatives were on a five-point scale (for the two first scales, never = 0, very often = 4; for the last
scale, not at all = 0, very much =4). For single items of the scales see Table 2.

2.3 Procedure
A paper-and pencil questionnaire was administered to the children by the researcher and a research
assistant. The field work was done in February 2019. No incentives or gifts were provided to the
respondents.

2.4 Ethical Considerations
The study was completely confidential; the names of the children were not recorded. The study
adheres to the principles concerning human research ethics of the Declaration of Helsinki (World
Medical Association, 2013), as well as guidelines for the responsible conduct of research of The
Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity (2012).

3.2 Reading and Writing Skills
Among the girls, 30.4% could not read at all, 43.5% could read a little, and 26.1% could read very
well. Among the boys, 29.8% could not read at all, 48.1% could read a little, and 22.1% could read
very well. Among the girls, 52.2% could not write at all, 34.8% could write a little, and 13.0% could
write very well. Among the boys, 53.8% could not write at all, 39.4% could write a little, and 6.7%

10

Jahanara Simu

could write very well. The differences between girls and boys regarding reading and writing skills
were not significant.
Reading and writing skills were added together to form one variable. Reading and writing skills
correlated positively with age (r = .51, p < .001). When keeping age as a covariate it was found that
reading and writing skills correlated negatively with frequency of maltreatment at work (r = -.17, p
= .045). It did not correlate with avoiding behaviours or frequency of diseases and health problems.

3.3 Age
Avoiding behaviours correlated significantly negatively with age (r = .36, p < .001). Age did not
correlate with diseases or health problems or with maltreatment at work.

3.4 Sleeping Places
Of the children in the sample, 28 girls and 91 boys slept at home with their parents, seven girls and
six boys slept in their workplace, and one girl slept in the street (Table 4).

3.7 Correlations between Scales
Maltreatment at work correlated significantly with diseases or health problems (r = .37, p < .001),
but not with avoiding behaviours. Diseases or health problems correlated negatively with avoiding
behaviours (r = -.17, p = .037).

3.8 Sex Differences
A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted with sex as the independent variable
and the three scales as dependent variables. The multivariate test was significant (Table 9, Fig. 1).
The univariate tests showed that girls scored significantly higher than boys on avoiding behaviours.
No significant sex difference was found for diseases or health problems or maltreatment at work.

4. Discussion
4.1 Summary of Findings
The study describes the working life of a sample of Bangladeshi working children. Similarly, to a
previous study (Islam, 2010), it was found that the number of years of education among the children
was very low. The average number of years of education was 2.7 for girls and 2.6 for boys
respectively. Around one-third of the children could not read at all, and more than half of them could
not write at all. The differences between girls and boys regarding their reading and writing skills were
not significant. The reading and writing skills correlated positively with age. It has previously been
found that the reading and writing skills did not correlate with the frequency of diseases and health
problems (Rahman et al., 2016).
The study reveals that the number of working hours per day of child labourers in Bangladesh was
more than eight hours per day. The result shows that 63.1% of girls and 60.6% of boys worked
between eight and ten hours per day.
The study found that most girls in the sample worked with cleaning, household chores, and
garment work, whereas most of the boys were involved in selling different types of goods. This is in
contrast with findings by Salmon (2005), Uddin et al. (2009), and Rahman and Hakim (2016), who
found that Bangladeshi child labourers were mostly engaged in the agricultural sector. The difference
is probably due to the living location of the children, where the children were working.
The working environment of the girls was hot, dirty, and polluted, and they had to walk long
distances, while others worked in noisy congested factories. The working environment of the boys in
the sample was dangerous and unsafe, unhealthy, polluted, dusty, and crowded. In accordance with
other studies, it was found that girls scored significantly higher than boys on avoiding behaviours
(Islam, 2013; Kamruzzaman, 2015; Kamruzzaman & Hakim, 2016, 2018; Kamruzzaman et al., 2016).
This study did not find any significant sex differences regarding diseases and health problems or
maltreatment at work. In accordance with two other studies (Islam, 2010; Kamruzzaman, 2015), it
was found that maltreatment at work correlated significantly with diseases and health problems.

4.2 Limitations of the Study
One limitation of the study was the small sample size. A larger number of respondents as well as an
instrument including several scales are needed to better investigate the working life of children. Since
the child labourers were not located in a definite area, interviewing a larger sample would have been

17

Jahanara Simu

more time-consuming. To find an equal number of girls and boys was also difficult. Differences
between children working in urban and rural areas could also be studied.

4.3 Implications of the Study
The literacy status of the child labourers needs to be addressed as well as the status of the rest of the
population. Education is the base of the development. The poor implications of the educational policy
in Bangladesh may be causing this situation. Based on the findings, policymakers and the developing
agents could rethink the educational development in order to meet the national goal. In addition,
effective incentives could be introduced focusing especially on the education of working children.
In terms of working hours, the study revealed that child labourers were treated in the same way as
adults, and in some cases, they had to work longer hours than adults. These findings will hopefully
help the child labour protecting agents to take necessary steps against employers of working children.
It has been recommended that there should be a legitimate working hour for children, and a regulatory
cell should monitor this activity in each district of the country. Similarly, this regulatory body is
planned to not only focus on working hours, but also on the working environment.
Furthermore, the study revealed that maltreatment of child labourers at work correlated with
diseases and health problems. Free medical facilities could improve the health of child labourers.
Mass-oriented media coverage could be launched in order to convey a message to health care
providers, schools, religious institutions, and other groups in the community. Without a mutual
understanding and the support of a variety of actors, the situation of working children cannot be
improved.

4.4 Suggestions for Future Research
The reasons for children working have not been investigated in this study. In future studies these
could also be included. Employers of children could also be interviewed, as well as other key
informants. There is a number of national and international instruments intended to protect child
labourers. Nevertheless, the situation of child labourers seems to remain the same. Further studies are
needed to underpin the weakness of both the policy and its implications.
