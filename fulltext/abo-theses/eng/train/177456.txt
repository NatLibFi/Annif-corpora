Abstract
This thesis focuses on modelling and simulation of the operation of a system of three hot stoves used
for preheating of the combustion air in the ironmaking blast furnace. A dynamic mathematical model
of the stove set was developed for the purpose. Several sample cases were investigated to examine how
the hot stoves characteristics, the bypass configuration, and the system operation variables influence
the behavior as well as the performance of the entire hot-stove system. In addition, a brief optimization
problem has been also studied with the goal to achieve optimum blast temperature.
The model developed in this work considers the heat transfer phenomena throughout the hot stove
operation sequence as well as the interconnection between the stoves within the system. In addition, the
effects of changes in different operation parameters, i.e., system full-cycle duration, stoves on-blast
periods, temperature target of the blast, fuel rate, and enrichment by external fuel, on the overall
performance of the system were also studied in the simulations. As the model is programmed with
adjustable parameters, it can easily be adapted to any other specific hot-stove system to allow for more
accurate and applicable outputs.

Introduction
Background

The iron- and steel-making industry is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive sectors which
accounts for 20% of the total energy use in the manufacturing industries [1]. Due to its high reliance on
fossil fuels as both energy carrier and reducing agent, the iron and steel industry is the largest CO2
emitter in the industrial sector and accounts for 4-7% of the global emissions and a similar range in
Europe [2]. Because of this, energy-saving efforts are very important in order to progress towards a
more efficient and green development of the iron- and steel-making processes.
One of the possible opportunities to reduce the energy consumption in the iron- and steel-making
process is through the optimization of the hot stove operation. Hot stoves, or cowpers, are regenerative
heat exchangers which serve the function of providing a constant flow of hot combustion air (“blast”)
for the blast furnace in the ironmaking process. Commonly, there are three to four hot stoves operating
in a system providing hot blast for one blast furnace. The operation of the hot-stove system is highly
dynamic as it involves two alternating main phases during the operation of each stove, namely a heating
phase and a cooling phase. Furthermore, because of the highly interconnected characteristics of the blast
preheating system, both operation parameters and performance of each stove influence the other stoves
in the set.
High blast temperature is one of the essential technical characteristics to be achieved in the operation
of a blast furnace. Elevating blast temperature can promote an improvement of performance of the
overall iron ore reduction process in the blast furnace (i.e., increase productivity), and decrease the
consumption of coke and fuel as well as minimize the CO2 emission [3]. According to a general practice,
an increase of 10 C in the hot blast temperature corresponds to coke consumption reduction by 1 kg/t
hot metal [4].
To be able to improve the performance of a hot-stove system, a good understanding of its operational
behavior is necessary. Mathematical models of hot stoves have been presented since the 1960s. The
model by Wilmott in 1968 [5] included the variation of gas flow rate and gas properties, while Razelos
and Benjamin in 1977 [6] also considered the temperature-dependent properties of the checkerwork.
The investigation by Kwakernaak et al. in 1970 [7] focused on determining the optimum thermal
efficiency of a hot stove in a staggered parallel system by adopting a numerical calculation using the
trapezoidal discretization method. In 2000, Muske et al. [8,9] developed a model-based control of a hot
stove where the dynamic heat transfer with temperature dependent gas and solid properties were
considered. While most of the earlier studies considered only a single stove, the more recent work by
Zetterholm in 2017 [1] developed a model for multiple hot stoves in the entire stove system. However,
further insight about the influence of different performance of each stove in the system is needed as
well as a deeper understanding of the bypass configuration.

1.2

Objective

The main objective of this work is to build a model that simulates the operational behavior of a system
of three serial hot stoves with different efficiencies based on the fundamental heat transfer equations.
This model is further to be used as a tool to investigate some operation strategies to achieve optimum
hot stoves performance with higher blast temperature and/or minimum consumption of coke and other
external fuel in the blast furnace.

Process Description
Overview of the Blast Furnace Ironmaking Process

The blast furnace ironmaking process is currently the most common route of pig iron production
worldwide. In a blast furnace, heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions occur at high temperatures
in a counter current flow configuration. The main input of this process consists of iron ore (pellets,
sinter or lump ore) as the main raw material, limestone, and coke as well as coal. Limestone is added to
remove unwanted components such as sulfur, silica, alumina, and magnesia, from the iron ore, whereas
coke and coal serve as the reducing agent and as the energy carriers in the blast furnace process. In
addition, coke also acts as a support structure for the layers of materials in the blast furnace and as a
bed through which the molten materials trickle down the blast furnace and the gas from the reduction
process flows upwards.
At the top of the blast furnace, iron ore, coke, and limestone are charged in layers. Meanwhile, hot air
and an additional reducing agent, such as pulverized coal, natural gas or fuel oil, are introduced through
the tuyeres at the bottom part of the blast furnace. As the burden sinks in the blast furnace, it travels
through a series of different temperature zones, at which different thermochemical conversions take
place. A schematic of a blast furnace is depicted in Figure 2.1 [10].

Figure 2.1 Schematic figure of a blast furnace [10]

Religia Shaliha
A series of chemical reactions occur during the reduction process in the blast furnace according to the
local temperature as well as the state of the feed and the gas. During the process in the blast furnace,
iron ore is heated up from ambient temperature to 1400 - 1450 C. The main reducing component for
the overall process is the CO, which is formed from the oxidation of the coal and coke in the lower
region of the blast furnace.
C + O2 → CO2
CO is also regenerated by the Boudouard (or “solution-loss”) reaction
C + CO2 ↔ 2 CO
At 500 - 900 C, hematite (Fe2O3) in the iron ore is reduced to magnetite (Fe3O4). In addition, the
reduction of magnetite to wüstite (FeO) takes place at a similar temperature range.
3 Fe2 O3 + CO ↔ 2 Fe3 O4 + CO2
Fe3 O4 + CO ↔ 3 FeO + CO2
In the lower region of the blast furnace, where the temperature gradually rises to 1400 C, wüstite is
further reduced to iron through both indirect and direct reduction.
FeO + CO ↔ Fe + CO2
FeO + C ↔ Fe + CO
In this region the iron and slag phases also melt and separate. It should be stressed that also hydrogen
acts as a reducing agent participating in similar reactions as those outlined for CO above (where CO
and CO2 can be replaced by H2 and H2O, respectively). The resulting outputs of the blast furnace are
molten pig iron, slag, and blast furnace gas. Due to its higher density, the molten pig iron is naturally
separated from the unwanted impurities bound in the slag and is tapped at the bottom of the blast
furnace. Meanwhile, the blast furnace gas is extracted at the top of the furnace. As this gas has some
heating value due to its CO and H2 content, which typically are around 20% and 3%, it can be utilized
to provide energy required in other sections of the steel plant. One of the typical uses of the blast furnace
top gas is to fuel the hot blast stoves during the heating phase.

2.2

Hot Blast Stoves

Hot blast stoves are an essential auxiliary equipment to blast furnace operation which provides a
constant flow of hot blast for the blast furnace process. Hot blast stoves are tall, cylindrical thermal
regenerators which consist of three main parts referred to as the combustion chamber, the dome, and
the checkerwork or the brick zone. This equipment is constructed of refractory materials that are capable
of withstanding elevated temperature as well as storing thermal energy. A schematic view of a typical
hot blast stove is shown in Figure 2.2.
Throughout its operation, a hot stove goes through alternating cycles of heating (on-gas) and cooling
(on-blast), with switching/idle period in between. During the heating phase, blast furnace top gas is
combusted inside the combustion chamber. It is also possible to apply fuel enrichment by adding a
fraction of other external fuel, such as coke oven gas, natural gas, or LPG to raise the combustion
temperature. The resulting combustion gas that can reach temperatures up to 1300 C flows by the
dome, passes through the channels in the checkerwork, and heats up the bricks in the checkerwork. In
contrast, during the cooling phase, pressurized air, which is referred to as cold blast, flows through the
hot stove in a reversed direction. This cold blast enters the bottom part of the checkerwork at around
150 C (which is the temperature reached after compression) and picks up thermal energy as it passes
3

Religia Shaliha
through the checkerwork. The blast flows through the dome and a part of the combustion chamber and
exits the hot stove at over 1000 C.
The temperature of the hot blast coming out of the hot stove naturally decreases during the cooling
phase due to the depletion of the thermal energy stored in the stove. Because of this, the temperature of
the hot blast from the hot stoves in some systems is regulated by bypassing a fraction of the cold blast
to mix directly with the heated air coming out from the stove. This enables the blast furnace to be
supplied with hot blast of constant flow and temperature regardless of the blast temperature drops at the
hot stove outlet, which makes it easier to control the thermal level of the blast furnace. However, it
comes at the expense of a lower average blast temperature. Therefore, it is usually a rule that the constant
blast temperature from the stove set should be kept as high as possible, considering the prevailing
conditions.

Typically, there are three to four hot blast stoves in operation for a blast furnace. Figure 2.3 depicts a
flow schematic of a system with three hot stoves in a bypass main serial configuration connected to a
blast furnace. In this kind of arrangement, usually one hot stove is operating in on-blast mode and
supplies hot blast for the blast furnace for a certain time period, while the other two stoves in the system
are being heated. The on-blast period is normally set such that the hot stove in the on-blast mode can
complete the entire on-blast period whilst sustaining the outgoing blast temperature to be higher than
the desired level. Once the hot stove in the on-blast mode completes its on-blast period, it is switched
into on-gas phase, and another stove in the system takes the turn to supply the hot blast to the blast
furnace.

Figure 2.3 Flow schematic of a system of three hot stoves in a bypass main serial configuration
connected to a blast furnace [11]
Between the heating and the cooling phase there is a change-over period where a hot stove switches its
operation mode. This period includes the required time to regulate the valves that allow the flows of the
gas and the air into the hot stove, purge the flue gas and pressurize the hot stove when switching from
heating to cooling mode, and to release the high pressure when the hot stove switches from cooling
mode to heating mode. Figure 2.4 briefly describes a typical operation sequence of one full cycle in a
system of three hot stoves.

Due to the large size and the dynamics of the valves, the blast flow cannot be switched abruptly.
Therefore, there are flow transitions in the beginning and at the end of an on-blast period. In a system
without bypass, the blast flow rate ramps up from no-flow when a stove starts the on-blast stage, and
ramps down from full-flow to no-flow when a stove finishes the on-blast phase. Meanwhile, during the
transitions in a system with bypass, the blast flow distribution looks somewhat different with the
presence of the bypass air. Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6 respectively illustrates the ideal blast flow
distribution throughout the cycles in a hot-stove system without bypass and with bypass. Note that the
unit of the abscissa is arbitrary. In reality, the flow progresses of the blast and the bypass are not
necessarily linear, depending on the characteristics and the dynamics of the valves in the system.

The checkerwork is constructed of stacked refractory bricks made of fireclay or high alumina material,
depending on the zone. These refractory bricks, referred to as checkers, are hexagonal bricks with
several channels for gas to pass through. Typically, each checker has 12 equivalent channels. In
addition, the top diameter of the gas channel is usually designed to be slightly narrower than the bottom
to enhance heat transfer in the stove [8]. The tongue and groove structure at the top and the bottom of
the bricks allow them to interlock and to be arranged in the checkerwork compactly. Figure 3.1 shows
a schematic of a checker that is being modelled in this work.

Checkerwork Geometry

In this study, hot stoves with internal combustion chambers are considered. Nevertheless, the scope of
heat transfer study in this work is limited to only the checkerwork part. The checkerwork region consists
of a number of brick courses and it is assumed that each course has uniform number of bricks. The
checkerwork part occupies approximately 75% of the total cross section area of the stove. An axial and

Approximated Checkerwork Geometry

For simplification, the gas flow distribution through the channels in the checkerwork was assumed to
be uniform, hence the calculation in this model was performed only for a single channel. The hexagonal
channel was modelled as a circular thick-walled tube with an even inner radius, 𝑟i. The outer radius of
the circular tube, 𝑟o , was determined as described in Equation (1), where 𝑉brick is the volume of brick
corresponding to 12 channels. In this equation, 𝑟o was calculated such that the heat storing capacity of
the brick is conserved; thus 𝑟o − 𝑟i can be interpreted as an equivalent wall thickness. Figure 3.4
illustrates a schematic of the modelled geometry of the thermal regenerator and Table 3.1 presents the
dimension of the modelled thermal regenerator which is used in the calculations.

Gas and Solid Temperature Model

The temperatures of the gas (blast or exhaust gas) and the brick are governed by the energy balance
over a single tube. This can generally be modelled by a system of partial differential equations [8]:

In the above equations, 𝑇g and 𝑇s are the gas and the solid temperature, 𝜐g is the gas velocity, 𝜌g and 𝜌s
are the gas and the solid density, 𝑐p,g and 𝑐p,s are the gas and the solid specific heat capacity, 𝑘s is the
thermal conductivity of the solid, 𝑃 is the pressure, ℎ is the gas-solid heat transfer coefficient, 𝐷h is the
hydraulic diameter of the gas channel, and 𝑇w is the solid wall temperature. In Equation (3), the first
and the second terms on the left-hand side represent the internal energy storing term and the rate of
work done on the gas by pressure forces, while the term on the right-hand side refers to the energy flow
by means of convective transport. In Equation (4), the terms on the left-hand side are the internal energy
storing term, and heat flow by conductive transport in radial and axial direction respectively.
The boundary conditions for the gas and the solid in the above equations are

In Equation (5), 𝑧in = 0 and 𝑧out = 𝐿 for the on-blast period, while 𝑧in = 𝐿 and 𝑧out = 0 for the ongas period, and 𝐿 is the total length of the channels, i.e., height of the checkerwork. The heat loss from
the checkerwork was considered from each gas channel wall by Equation (6c), where the heat transfer
coefficient ℎloss was set to yield a reasonable over-all heat loss from the stove (cf. end of subsection
3.3).
This mathematical model is based on several assumptions:
1. The blast and the exhaust gas are treated as ideal gases.
2. Because of the low heat conductivity of the gas, the heat conduction of gas in axial direction is
negligible and the gas-solid convection gives the dominant heat transfer in the system.
3. As the diameter of the gas channel is relatively very small compared to the height of the
checkerwork, it is assumed that there is no gas temperature gradient in the radial direction.
To reduce the computation time, further simplifications are made to the model and are discussed in the
following subsections. A brief derivation of the gas and solid temperature simplified model is provided
in Appendix.

Simplification of the Solid Temperature Model

The radial temperature profile for the solid was briefly evaluated to examine its significance to the heat
transfer in the system. By solving the simplified form of Equation (4) and Equation (7) over several
cycles of alternating on-gas and on-blast phases, the radial temperature profile of the solid was obtained
at quasi-stationary state. In this evaluation, the temperature of the incoming combustion gas temperature
and the cold blast were arbitrarily fixed at 1300 C and 150 C respectively. In addition, the modelled
thermal regenerator was assumed to be perfectly insulated at the outer radius, so the heat loss term was
neglected. Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6 show the radial temperature profile at the five uppermost and
lowermost height segments after a typical on-gas and on-blast phase.

Figure 3.6 Solid temperature profile in radial direction of five uppermost segments (left) and five
lowermost segments (right) of the modelled checkerwork after a typical on-blast phase
From the performed evaluation, it was found that the temperature variation of the solid in radial
direction was below 1 C and 3 C at the end of the simulated on-gas phase and on-blast phase
respectively. Even though the heat loss was not (yet) considered, it was estimated that it would not have
considerable effect on the solid temperature profile in the radial direction. Therefore it was assumed
that the checkers behave as a lumped parameter thermal system in the radial direction in the model,
exactly as also done by Muske et al. [8] in their modeling work.
Based on the evaluation of heat transfer within the solid in the radial direction, the radial term in the
energy balance partial differential equation for solid was neglected. Hence, the simplified temperature
model for solid is described as

where the function 𝑓(𝑧) is arbitrary, but a previous solution of the solid temperatures can be used to
speed up the convergence. According to [8], the effect of pressurization and blow-off on the
checkerwork temperature during the switching/idle period before the on-blast and the on-gas cycle start,
is small. Based on this, the gas-solid heat transfer during this period was neglected and that only heat
loss is considered to affect the checkerwork temperature during this period.

3.3 Heat Transfer Parameters
3.3.1 Physical Properties of the Gas
The physical properties of the combustion gas and the blast at a certain time and position in the stove
are determined based on the gas temperature, the gas composition, and temperature dependent physical
properties of the gas components. The density of the gas is determined according to the ideal gas law
𝜌m =

𝑅𝑇

(14)

Religia Shaliha
In this work, interpolating functions of physical properties for each component versus temperature from
Zetterholm et.al. [1] were used to determine the specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and
viscosity of the gas mixture. The physical properties data used in the interpolating functions referred to
the available data by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Kjellström et.al.
[14]. The specific heat capacity of the gas mixture is calculated based on component fraction in the gas
mixture and individual component specific heat capacities according to
𝑛

(15)

𝑐p,m = ∑ 𝑥𝑖 𝑐p,𝑖
𝑖=1

where 𝑥𝑖 is the mass fraction of component 𝑖 and 𝑐p,𝑖 is the specific heat capacity of pure component 𝑖.
The viscosity of the gas mixture is estimated according to the method of Wilke, while the thermal
conductivity of the gas mixture is determined using the method of Mason and Saxena [8]. The
estimations of the viscosity and the thermal conductivity of the gas mixture are shown in Equations (17)
and (18) respectively. Both calculations are based on the component fraction, the properties of
individual components, and the interaction parameter between two species, 𝜙𝑖,𝑗 .

Gas Velocity and Mass Flowrate

The velocity of the gas passing through the channels is determined according to
𝜐g =

4𝑚̇g in
𝜋𝜌g 𝑁c,check 𝐷h2

(19)

In the calculation for the hot-stove system without bypass, the mass flowrate of the gas during the ongas phase and mass flowrate of the blast during the on-blast phase are constant. In this configuration,
during the on-blast stage, the temperature of the hot blast at the outlet of the checkerwork naturally
declines as time progresses due to the depletion of the thermal energy stored in the checkerwork.
As for the hot-stove system with bypass, during the on-blast phase, the mass flow rate of the blast fed
into the stove is controlled such that the final hot blast temperature can be maintained at the desired
temperature required by the blast furnace. This is done by diverting a share of the cold blast flow and
15

Religia Shaliha
mixing the diverted flow of cold blast with the outcoming hot blast from the stove. Based on the energy
balance of the flows mixing, the mass flowrate fed into the stove can be theoretically calculated using
𝑇

𝑚̇bl,in =

∫𝑇 bl,tr 𝑐p,g 𝑑𝑇
bl,in

𝑚̇bl,tot
𝑇
∫𝑇 bl,out 𝑐p,g 𝑑𝑇

(20)

where, 𝑚̇bl,tot is the total mass flowrate of the blast in the hot-stove system, 𝑇bl,in and 𝑇bl,out are the
blast temperature at the inlet and the outlet of the stove respectively, and 𝑇bl,tr is the target temperature
of the hot blast after mixing of hot blast from the stove and bypass air.
The share of the cold blast that shall flow into the stove at any given time can be estimated from an
energy balance equation. Assuming that the gas specific heat capacity is approximately constant on
average, we get
𝑥bl,in =

3.3.3

𝑇bl,tr − 𝑇bl,in
𝑇bl,out − 𝑇bl,in

(21)

Heat Transfer Coefficients

During the on-gas cycle, both convective and radiative heat transfer contribute to the overall heat
transfer. This is due to the presence of a considerable fraction of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the
combustion gas. During the on-blast cycle, radiative heat transfer might also take place beside the
convective heat transfer. However, since the content of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the cold blast
is relatively small, only convective heat transfer is considered during the on-blast cycle. The total heat
transfer coefficients for the on-gas and the on-blast cycle are described as
ℎheat = ℎconv + ℎrad
ℎblast = ℎconv
The coefficient of the convective heat transfer, ℎconv, during on-gas cycle and on-blast cycle is
estimated from the Nusselt number. In this work, the correlation used to determine the Nusselt number
for flow inside long circular tubes is [4]

The correlation in Equation (22) is valid for 𝑅𝑒 > 104 and 0.7 < 𝑃𝑟 < 120. Even though the Reynolds
number for the gas and blast flow in the studied hot-stove system is smaller than 104 , this correlation
was nevertheless used for approximate estimation.
Based on the above relationships, the convective heat transfer coefficient is
ℎconv =

𝑁𝑢 𝑘g
𝐷h

(25)

16

Religia Shaliha
Beside the range of operating temperature, the radiative heat transfer from a gas to a surface is mostly
determined by the content of the radiating species in the gas, which are CO2 and H2O. The radiation
from the CO2 and H2O in the hot combustion gas to the checker channel surface can contribute by up
to 20% of the total heat transferred during the on-gas cycle [8]. In this case, the checker channel surface
is treated as a grey, opaque, diffuse surface. The heat radiation from combustion gas to the surface of
the checker channels can, therefore, be described by Equation (26) [1], which assumes symmetrical gas
geometry in an infinite long cylinder.
𝑄̇rad =

𝜖s 𝜎(𝜖g 𝑇g4 − 𝛼g 𝑇s4 )
1 − (1 − 𝛼g )(1 − 𝜖s )

(26)

The emissivity of the checker channel surface was estimated to be 𝜖s = 0.8 [8] while the total emissivity
and absorptivity of the gas, 𝜖g and 𝛼g , were estimated by using the method of Hottel. The method of
Hottel uses the correlation between the gas temperature, the gas total pressure, the partial pressure of
the radiating species, and the beam length of the gas geometry. Since the ratio between the channel
diameter to the checkerwork length is very small, it is assumed that the prevailing heat radiation is
towards the curved surface of the gas channel. Therefore, the characteristic length for the heat radiation
is defined as the diameter of the channel, 𝐷ℎ , and the mean beam length is set as 0.95 𝐷h [15].
Based on the above considerations, the radiative heat transfer coefficient is approximated as
ℎrad =

𝜖s 𝜎(𝜖g 𝑇g4 − 𝛼g 𝑇s4 )
1
1 − (1 − 𝛼g )(1 − 𝜖s ) 𝑇g − 𝑇s

(27)

According to the stove heat loss evaluation performed by Nyman [4] in 2014 at SSAB Raahe, the
average heat loss rate from stove #3 for BF2 to the surrounding , was found to be 𝑄̅loss ≈ 600 kW. This
value was obtained based on the measurement of surface temperature of the stove. By assuming that
the average heat loss rate stays at this level, and that all of the heat loss comes from the checkerwork,
the coefficient of heat loss to the surrounding for one checker channel was approximated as
ℎloss =

Model Solution Technique

The simplified model of the gas and solid energy balances was solved numerically using the pdepe
solver in MATLAB. This solver implements the method of lines together with a finite element
discretization in space, i.e., the spatial derivatives are discretized while the time derivatives are held
continuous [16]. Therefore, the internal time step is variable and progresses according to the fixed
tolerance level, but results can be required at suitable time moments (e.g., at given steps in time).

3.5 Simulation of Hot-Stove System
3.5.1 Combustion Calculation
Before starting the main simulation of the hot stoves, the calculation of fuel combustion is done to
determine the state of combustion gas entering the checkerwork during the on-gas cycle. The following
assumptions are made to simplify the calculation.
17

Religia Shaliha
1. The composition of the supplied fuel gas, i.e., blast furnace top gas with or without addition of
external fuel, is constant.
2. Fuel and air are perfectly mixed in all local regions inside the combustion chamber, resulting
in complete combustion.
3. The combustion air is assumed to be dry, with the composition of 79% N2 and 21% O2. The
flowrate of the combustion air is estimated from the air excess factor, which is approximated
from the target O2 content in the exhaust gas.
4. The combustion takes place under adiabatic conditions
5. The combustion is assumed to be complete and any C and H in the fuel is converted into CO2
and H2O.
The air excess factor, 𝜆, can be briefly estimated using target value of the O2 concentration in dry
combustion gas [14]

Hot-stove Main Simulation

In this work, the hot-stove system was simulated based on the formulated heat transfer models. The
calculation is performed for every hot stove in the system and through a sequence according to the
operation of the hot stoves as described in Chapter 2.
To enable a continuous flow of hot blast to the blast furnace, the total cycle length is the sum of the
durations of on-blast times of the 𝑛 hot stoves in the system. Provided that the time required to complete
the purging and switching stages are identical for each stove in the system, the length of the on-gas
period for each stove can be determined according to
𝑛

𝑡heat,𝑖 = ∑ 𝑡blast,𝑖 − 𝑡switch tot,𝑖 − 𝑡purge,𝑖

(31)

𝑖=1

The simulation of the stove system was done according to the desired number of steps or until a
convergence criterion was satisfied, expressing that the system has stabilized to reach a quasi-stationary
state. In this work, some assumptions that were made when performing the simulation are listed below:
1. The incoming flows of combustion gas and blast were assumed to have constant temperature
at the boundary, constant composition, and constant mass flowrate over the simulated period.
2. The length of purging and switching periods was kept constant for each stove regardless of
different on-gas and on-blast cycle periods.
Based on the simulation procedure described above, the temperature profiles of gas and solid over the
simulated period and along the checkerwork height are solved.

where, 𝑧 is the spatial interval where the temperature is being assigned and 𝑁step,z is the number of

possibly affect the number of cycles required before quasi-steady state is reached, any starting point can
be used, nevertheless.

Optimization of the Hot-stove System

Using the simulation procedure, the possibility to optimize the hot-stove system performance was
investigated. The objective is to identify the operation conditions that enable as high final blast
temperature as possible and/or minimize the consumption of fuel. The optimization problem for
maximizing the blast temperature can be written as
min{𝐹 = −𝑇bl,end }
𝒙

(33)

∀𝑖 , 𝑡 ∈ 𝒦qss

(34b)

In Equation (33), 𝒙 refers to a vector of manipulated variables, which in this work includes the duration
of the on-blast cycle of each stove, final hot blast temperature set point, and the share of external fuel.
In Equation (34), indices 1 and 𝑁 refer to the first and the last segment of the discretized checkerwork
19

Religia Shaliha
length, 𝑖 refers to the stove number, and 𝒦qss is the set of time steps in a hot stove cycle at quasistationary state operation. The constraints in Equation (34a) and (34b) express some temperature limits
for the checkerwork operating at quasi-stationary state. The temperature of the dome after the
combustion chamber should not exceed a maximum allowable value (𝑇h,max) to prevent brickwork
damage. In addition, an upper limit for the temperature at the cold end of the stoves (𝑇c,max ) is usually
imposed to avoid damage to the support structures of the checkerworks [12]. Note that the constraints
here are set arbitrarily and do not necessarily correspond to those applied in the industry.
The pressure loss over the hot stove, which is dictated by the gas pipeline and gas holder pressure, could
also be included as one of the constraints limiting the feasible solution. However, it is not considered
here since pressure loss was not modelled in this work.

Results and Discussion

This chapter presents some results of combustion calculation and simulation of the hot stove system.
Simulations of different cases of hot-stove systems with and without bypass were done with the focus
to evaluate the typical thermal behavior of system at various operating conditions, to investigate the
extent of the effects given by the contributing variables in the operation, as well as to search for
possibilities to optimize the system.
4.1 Combustion of Fuel Gas
Before the hot stove simulations were performed, the combustion of the fuel gas was evaluated to
determine the state of the gas that is fed into the hot stoves and that heats up the checkerwork during
the on-gas stage. Table 4.1 shows the default input data used in the combustion calculations in this
work.

Top gas after gas cleaning
Combustion fuel mixture

For the given top gas composition, the heating value of the top gas is approximately 3 MJ/m3n. Based
on the calculation performed using the input data in Table 4.1, it was estimated that the combustion air
excess factor, 𝜆, of the studied hot-stove system is around 0.26 and the temperature of the combustion
gas is about 1160 C. Apparently, the estimated 𝜆 is quite high as the typical air factor, (1+ 𝜆), for gas
burner is within the range of 1.05 to 1.1 [14]. However, the estimated 𝜆 in this study could be
overestimated, since a theoretical approach was taken in the calculation. To illustrate the discrepancies
that potentially arise due to this approach, the typical relationship between the component fractions in
the combustion gas versus the air factor in both theoretical and real combustion is depicted in Figure
4.1.
According to Figure 4.1, theoretically, stoichiometric combustion (𝜆 = 0) yields no O2 in the
combustion gas. However, in reality, there is some O2 present in the gas product of the combustion,
because it is almost impossible to have perfect fuel-air mixing in all local regions in the combustion
chamber. In this work, 𝜆 was calculated based on the measured O2 content in the combustion gas, while
it was assumed that the combustion occurs ideally. Because of this, the estimated 𝜆 might be too high
and, therefore, the predicted temperature of the combustion gas could possibly be lower than it is in
reality.
To approach better accuracy in determining the temperature of the combustion gas entering the
checkerwork, temperature measurements of the gas, e.g. at the stove dome, can be helpful. In addition,

Simulation of Hot-stove System

In this work, the system simulated consists of three hot stoves (𝑛 = 3). A spatial step of about 0.4 m
was used in the checkerworks and the solution was taken out for every 10 seconds. For each case, the
simulation was done for 30 full stove cycles, as it adequately satisfies the fixed convergence criterion
of quasi-stationary state for all cases. In this study, the systems are assumed to have reached the quasistationary state when the difference of the hot blast temperatures between two consecutive cycles is
below 1 C.
A brief energy balance evaluation over the solid and gas in the modelled checkerwork was first
performed for a system with identical hot stoves and without bypass, with the purpose of verifying the
model’s reliability. Only for this energy balance check, the heat loss is not considered. The energy
balance was evaluated at the end of an on-gas and an on-blast phase at quasi-stationary state, and was
calculated as [8]

Religia Shaliha
relative percentage of error in the energy balance. Based on the evaluation, for the spatial step size used
in the simulation, 𝐸error ≈ 0.9% for the on-gas and 𝐸error ≈ 0.7% for the on-blast stage, respectively.
Thus, the model must be deemed fairly accurate. Spatial discretization using finer increment and setting
smaller time step size can reduce the errors, but this will also require longer computation time.
The general parameters used in the simulation are listed in Table 4.2. In addition, the simulation in this
work assumes a period of blast flow transition during the first two minutes and the last two minutes of
each on-blast period. As for the parameters related with combustion calculation, the data from Table
4.1 is used unless otherwise specified.

The results of the simulation are the estimated temperatures of the gas (the combustion gas and the hot
blast) and the solid (the checkerwork bricks) within the defined range of position and time. Among the
variables of interest to be evaluated from the simulation results are the hot blast temperature at the stove
outlet (𝑇bl,out ), and the final hot blast temperature (𝑇bl,end ) which is the temperature of the combustion
air in the blast furnace. It is desirable that the hot-stove system is capable to deliver hot blast with a
stable and as high temperature as possible within the range of 1000-1250 C. In addition, it is important
that the solid temperatures, 𝑇s , at both the hot end (𝑇s,N) and the cold end of the checkerwork (𝑇s,1) are
maintained below the maximum allowable temperatures, which in this work are limited to 1300 C at
the hot end and 350 C at the cold end.
In general, it can be expected that the variables affecting 𝑇bl,end and 𝑇s include: (1) the duration of full
cycles of the stoves (𝑡cyc ), which is determined by the length of on-blast period of each stove in the
system, (2) the combustion fuel level, and (3) the combustion fuel heating value, which depends on the
composition of the top gas and the addition of external fuel. There are many possible scenarios with
different operating conditions of the hot-stove system. In this work, several cases were studied and will
be discussed in the next sections. These case studies are chosen to reflect how the hot stoves
characteristics, the bypass configuration, and the system operation variables influence the performance
of the entire hot-stove system.
4.2.1 System of Identical Hot Stoves without Bypass
Case 1 – System of Hot Stoves of Identical Characteristics and Equal On-blast Periods
In this section, hot stoves of identical characteristics and equal on-blast periods in a system without
bypass is studied. The parameters used are listed in Table 4.3. Here, the parameters related to fuel were
set to default, with maximum fuel rate (𝑓fuel = 1) and no addition of external fuel
(𝑥ext fuel = 0). Figure 4.2 shows the hot blast temperature evolution during the first 20 cycles (transient
state) while the results of the thermal behavior of the system at quasi-steady state are shown in Figure
4.3 to Figure 4.6.

Figure 4.2 Evolution of blast temperature during the first 20 cycles for Case 1
The upper panel of Figure 4.3 shows the temperature of the hot blast flowing out of each individual
stove (𝑇bl,out ) in the system throughout the operation at quasi-stationary state. Note that the mass flow
rate of the hot blast right after the stove is not constant as there are flow ramps-up and -down during
the blast transition phase, i.e., the first two minutes and the last two minutes of the on-blast stages. It
can be observed that 𝑇bl,out starts from a quite low temperature during the transition when the on-blast
phase commences. This is likely due to the low heat transfer coefficient during the pre-blast transition
phase (the first two minutes of the on-blast stage), as depicted in Figure 4.4. The convective heat transfer
coefficient is dictated by the velocity of the gas, which is dependent on the mass flowrate. On the other
hand, mass flowrate of the blast also determines the energy balance during the gas-solid heat exchange.
As the blast flow ramps down during the post-blast transition phase, there is less blast available to carry
the enthalpy, which results in a slight rise in 𝑇bl,out .
The bottom panel of Figure 4.3 presents the final temperature profile of the total hot blast after mixing
of the flows from the stoves (𝑇bl,end ). The simulation result predicted that 𝑇bl,end from the system
decreases from 1125 C to 1008 C throughout the 60 minutes of the on-blast period. This reflects the
depletion of the thermal energy stored in the checkerwork as it keeps giving off heat to the cold blast
during the on-blast phase. 𝑇bl,end read by a slow thermocouple (behaving as a first order system) may
show somewhat narrower temperature range than the real temperature range, as illustrated by the red
dashed line.

Figure 4.5 depicts how the temperature of the checkerwork hot end and cold end evolve throughout the
cycles at quasi-stationary state operation. Considerable changes can be observed especially in the
checkerwork temperature at the hot end, or the uppermost segment of the checkerwork (𝑇s,N ). From the
top panel of Figure 4.5, it can be seen that during the stove heating phase (A), 𝑇s,N rises to a high
temperature close to combustion gas temperature. The temperature then slightly decreases during the
short period of purging (B) where the remaining combustion gas inside the stove is flushed out by an
air flow. When the stove is switched (C) to prepare for the on-blast stage, 𝑇s,N stays relatively constant.
𝑇s,N then decreases throughout the on-blast period (D), and when the stove has finished the on-blast
stage, it is switched (E) to heating stage and starts over the cycle.

in Figure 4.6, the temperature of the checkerwork at the inlet boundary became reasonably close to the
temperature of the gas and the blast flowing into the stove at the end of the on-gas and the on-blast
phase respectively.

Effect of the Duration of Full Cycle on the Final Blast Temperature
The duration of one full cycle (𝑡cyc) of the hot-stove system governs the on-blast phase period (𝑡blast )
and the on-gas phase period (𝑡heat ) for each stove, which in turn rules 𝑇bl,end . At a longer full cycle
time, 𝑡heat also becomes longer, leading to more thermal energy stored in the checkerwork. On the other
hand, this effect might be inherently counterbalanced since also 𝑡blast becomes extended at a prolonged
full cycle time, which may result in larger temperature decrease during the on-blast cycle and thus
lowering 𝑇bl,end at the end of the on-blast cycle.
For systems of hot stoves with equally long on-blast period for each stove, the predicted effect of the
on-blast period of 30-90 minutes, i.e., full cycle length of 90-270 minutes, on the lowest final blast
min
temperature at the end of the on-blast period (𝑇bl,end
) is captured in Figure 4.7.
min
The highest 𝑇bl,end
≈ 1011℃ is achieved at 𝑡blast ≈ 80 min, i.e., 𝑡cyc ≈ 240 min and 𝑡heat ≈
160 min. For 𝑡blast > 80 min, the lowest final blast temperature is estimated to start declining. This
could be due to the fact that the checkerwork has a limited heat storing capacity, so it starts to get
thermally saturated during the on-gas phase when it is heated for a period longer than 160 minutes and
with the temperature of the combustion gas predicted in Case 1 (cf. two upper curves in Figure 4.6).
The upper part of the checkerwork reaches a temperature close to the temperature of the combustion
gas, hence lowering the heat transfer rate. Furthermore, assuming that the checkerwork cooling rate
during the on-blast cycle is somewhat constant due to the constant cold blast flow rate through the
checkerwork, more thermal energy is discharged from the checkerwork at an extended 𝑡blast whereas
the available thermal energy at the beginning of the on-blast period is approximately at the same level.

System of Hot Stoves of Different Characteristics without Bypass

In reality, each stove has different characteristics due to many factors including different ages (except
for greenfield plants) due to different revamping history of the stoves. Furthermore, the stoves may
have different checkerwork materials or different control system responsiveness. The first alternative is
still the most common reason for the differences: channels may be partially or fully clogged because of
soot or particulate deposition, which decreases the available heat transfer surfaces in the checkerworks,
or even melting due to occasional operation under too high temperatures (e.g., caused by excessive
flame lengths). These factors can lower the efficiency of an individual stove and thus the overall
performance of the hot-stove system.
In this section several cases of hot stoves of different characteristics in a system without bypass are
evaluated. The parameters used in the simulation of those cases are listed in Table 4.4. A multiplying
factor 𝜂, with value ranging from 0 to 1, was used to represent the different characteristics/efficiency
of each stove and corresponds to the equivalent share of the checkerwork channels available for heat
exchange. Therefore, a value of 𝜂 = 0.8 is interpreted as a stove where only 80% of the channels are
operating; thus, both the heat transfer surface and the available solid mass are decreased by 20% from
the nominal values. It should also be stressed that the gas velocity in the channels increase
correspondingly (cf. Equation (19)). In both Case 2A and 2B, the values of 𝜂 were set as 1, 0.8, and 0.6
for Stove 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Whereas the on-blast periods were set to be identical for the stoves
in Case 2A, the on-blast periods were varied in accordance with the characteristics of the stoves in Case
2B.

Case 2A – System of Hot Stoves of Different Characteristics and Equal On-blast Periods
Figure 4.9 illustrates the approach to quasi-stationary state of a stove set with the characteristics of Case
2A. Further scrutiny of the results reveals that the difference in stoves characteristics can be noticed in
the blast temperature particularly at the end of the on-blast period, as 𝑡blast,𝑖 for each stove is equal.
According to Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11, the temperature of the hot blast from the most deteriorated
stove is dragged down to 941 C at the end of its on-blast period, while the last temperature of the hot
blast from the other two stoves are still around 1009 C and 983 C at the end of their on-blast stages.
It can also be observed from Figure 4.10 (upper panel) that the different physical characteristics of the
stoves also have some influence on the predicted initial 𝑇blast at the beginning of the on-blast phase.
According to simulated temperature profile of the checkerworks depicted in Figure 4.11, it can be
observed that when a hot stove’s performance is deteriorated, it becomes undersized for its designed
29

Religia Shaliha
operating condition. This is shown by 𝑇s at both the hot end and the cold end of the checkerwork. As
the checkerwork is heated more rapidly during the on-gas period, it is also cooled down faster during
the on-blast phase in comparison with the other stoves with better characteristics. Because of this, some
local hot spots at the bottom part of the checkerwork may appear in the case where the stove’s channels
are clogged.

Case 2B – System of Hot stoves of Different Characteristics and Different On-blast Periods
As a bypass configuration is typically implemented to control the fluctuating temperature of the
outcoming hot blast, it can be expected that the final blast temperature is therefore limited to the lowest
𝑇bl,end . To elevate the overall temperature of the final hot blast, it is intuitive to adjust the length of the
on-blast period of each stove based on its characteristics. This can be done by shortening the 𝑡blast for
the stove with lower efficiency and extending it for the stove with better efficiency, such that a stove
ends its on-blast stage before its hot blast temperature drops below the desired level.
Here, the on-blast durations were chosen by trial and error and by keeping the system full cycle duration
the same as in Case 2A, which is 180 minutes, yielding the values reported in the last column of Table
4.4. In this example, different 𝑡blast were implemented to each stove in the system to evaluate the effect
on the overall hot blast temperature. The dynamic evolution of the system is illustrated in Figure 4.12
and the predicted temperatures of the hot blast and the checkerwork at quasi-steady state are shown in
Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14. From Figure 4.13 it can be seen that the stove with better efficiency
compensates the deteriorated stove and that the overall lowest 𝑇bl,end rises by 27 C, to 968 C,
compared to the hot-stove system in Case 2A.
The length of on-blast period for each stove should be chosen carefully so it guarantees continuous hot
blast flow at the targeted temperature as well as safe operating temperature for the checkerwork. As the
duration of the heating phase is determined by 𝑡blast , varying this variable may give amplified effect on
the 𝑇bl,out and also on 𝑇s . For a constant full cycle duration, a prolonged 𝑡blast for a stove means shorter
𝑡heat . Because of this, more thermal energy is discharged from the checkerwork during the on-blast
period and less thermal energy is gained by the checkerwork during the on-gas period. As a result,
31

Religia Shaliha
𝑇bl,out at the end of the on-blast stage becomes lower and also 𝑇s decreases. The opposite effect results
from a stove with a reduced 𝑡blast .

Effect of the Stoves On-blast Periods on the Final Blast Temperature
When selecting 𝑡blast for each stove, different combination of the stoves on-blast periods will give
different overall hot-stove system performance. For a fixed full cycle duration of 180 minutes and 𝑡blast
of each stove ranging between 58 and 60 minutes, studied with a time step of 1⁄3 min, the predicted
effect on 𝑇bl,end is depicted in Figure 4.15. The vertical axis in the figure shows the minimum
min
temperature of the resulting final hot blast, 𝑇bl,end
, throughout the cycles at quasi-stationary state.
Due to the characteristics of the stoves in this case, it can be expected that the feasible solutions are
limited to the conditions where 𝑡blast,1 > 𝑡blast,2 > 𝑡blast,3. Based on the simulation results, it can be
seen that shortening 𝑡blast,3 below 60 minutes to some extent can contribute to higher overall final hot
blast temperature. However, for 𝑡blast,3 < 58 min, a reversed trend occurs where the resulting
minimum 𝑇bl,end starts to decrease. This happens because at too short 𝑡blast,3 , the periods 𝑡blast,1 and
𝑡blast,2 become longer, and thus the temperatures of the hot blast from Stove 1 and Stove 2 become
limiting.
In addition, as portrayed in Figure 4.16, too short on-blast period for Stove 3 can result in excessive
thermal energy accumulation in the checkerwork, which leads to too high temperatures at the cold end
max
of the checkerwork. 𝑇s,1
in Figure 4.16 is the calculated highest temperature reached by the cold end
of the checkerwork evaluated at quasi-stationary state operation. Therefore, for this case, it is predicted
min
that the highest 𝑇bl,end
= 975 ℃ is achieved at 𝑡blast,1 = 61.67 min and 𝑡blast,2 = 60.33 min.

System of Hot Stoves of Different Characteristics with Bypass

In this section, systems of hot stoves of different characteristics with bypass configuration are studied.
With the presence of bypass, the temperature of the final hot blast from the hot-stove system is
controlled, so that it can be maintained at a desirable target temperature (𝑇bl,tr ) throughout the operation
cycles. Table 4.5 lists the parameters used in the three simulated cases, Cases 3A-3C. In these cases,
different duration of the system cycle, hot blast target temperature, and fuel rate were tested.

Case 3A – System of hot stoves with 𝑡cyc = 180 min and 𝑇bl,tr = 975 ℃
Figure 4.17 shows the transient state of the hot-stove system during the first 20 simulated cycles.
Obviously, compared to the simulated cases of the systems without bypass, the hot-stove system with
bypass stabilizes to quasi-stationary state considerably faster. Although this could also be influenced
by the starting temperature of the checkerwork at the initial condition, which is probably already quite
close to that in the quasi-stationary state, the presence of the blast controller in the system clearly drives
the system to converge to the blast temperature target.
Figure 4.18 presents the temperature of the hot blast from the stoves (upper panel) and the final blast
temperature obtained after “mixing” of the former with the bypass flow (lower panel). According to the
evaluation in the previous section, the hot-stove system with same operating parameters should be able
to uphold a stable final hot blast temperature at a set point of about 975 C. However, the present
simulation predicted slightly different thermal behavior for this system with bypass configuration due
to the different quantities of blast passed through the checkerwork – mainly during the blast transition
phase, and also due to the lagging blast share controller model.
In general, the simulated 𝑇bl,end can be maintained around the target during the on-blast period.
However, at quasi-steady state it appears to be somewhat lower than the targeted temperature. This
mismatch is likely due to the use of the simplified equation for temperature controller that calculates
the blast share as described in Equation (21) in Chapter 3. The blast share flowing into the hot stove,
𝑥bl,in (𝑡), during the on-blast period is determined based on the hot blast temperature coming out from
the stove at the previous time step, (𝑡-1), which is higher than that at the current time step. In addition,
some temperature spikes and falls (with a lowest 𝑇bl,end = 953 ℃) appear during the blast transition
periods, since no bypass controller model is yet implemented during the blast transition stages in the
simulation. With a more appropriate controller model in future studies, these issues may be resolved.

36

Religia Shaliha
The blast share profile with time at quasi-steady state for Case 3A is depicted in Figure 4.19. With the
bypass configuration, only a share of the cold blast passes though the hot stoves. Because of this, the
blast temperature after the stoves (before mixing with bypass) is quite high, above 1050 C, compared
to that in the hot-stove system without bypass in Case 2B, where it is below 1000 C. Moreover, this
also results in even higher checkerwork temperature at the cold end of Stove 3, which exceeds the
maximum limit of 350 C (cf. bottom panel of Figure 4.20).
In hot-stove systems with bypass, while 𝑇bl,tr is clearly determined by the requirement of the blast
furnace operation, 𝑇bl,tr also influences the dynamics of the system. The control system governs the
𝑥bl,in so that the final blast temperature falls at the target, 𝑇bl,tr . Therefore, 𝑇bl,tr indirectly determines
the cooling rate of the stoves as well as the last hot blast temperature from the stove at the end of its onblast period. At a higher target, a larger share of cold blast is fed into the hot stove and thus more thermal
energy is drained from the stove, lowering the temperature of the checkerwork. From Figure 4.19 it can
be noticed that the share of the cold blast flowing into the hot stoves at any time point in quasi-stationary
state does not reach 100%. Ideally, in a well-adjusted system, the blast share starts at a level below
100% in the beginning of the on-blast phase, and then increases to 100% at the end of the on-blast
period. This means that the 𝑇bl,tr in Case 3A could have been set higher.
Considering the factors affecting the hot-stove system operation, the feasible operating conditions for
the hot-stove system with bypass in the following cases were approached through several scenarios
including setting a higher 𝑇bl,tr , reducing the full cycle duration, and lowering the fuel level.

Case 3B – System of hot stoves with 𝑡cyc = 135 min and 𝑇bl,tr = 1000 ℃
Simulation results of a higher target blast temperature combined with a shorter cycle duration are
presented in this example. Here, the on-blast periods for the stoves were set 46 min, 45 min, and 44 min
for Stove 1, 2, and 3 respectively, which means the cycle duration is shorter compared to that in Case
3A. The dynamic evolution of the system is illustrated in Figure 4.21 and the predicted temperatures of
the hot blast and the checkerwork at quasi-steady state are shown in Figure 4.22 to Figure 4.24.
From Figure 4.22 it can be seen that the predicted hot blast temperature can be stabilized at the desired
temperature target. In addition, the temperature spikes and dips during the blast transitions are found to
be clearly lower compared to Case 3A. It can also be observed from Figure 4.23 that with a shorter
cycle duration, the blast flow share starts at a higher level initially, and then gradually increases close
to one at the end of the on-blast period. One possible reason for this is that at a shorter cycle duration,
the on-gas period also becomes shorter and, thus, the thermal energy level in the checkerwork at the
beginning of an on-blast period is likely to be not as high as that at a longer cycle duration. Therefore,
the controller regulates higher share of blast flow to pick up heat from the stove so that 𝑇bl,tr can be
achieved after mixing the blast flow with bypass air. In addition, as expected, the checkerwork’s
temperature at the cold end can be kept below 350 C due to shorter full cycle length and also higher
𝑇bl,tr in comparison with Case 3A (cf. bottom panel of Figure 4.24).
However, one downside of a hot-stove system with a shorter full cycle duration is that the switching
stages become more frequent compared to that in a system with a longer full cycle duration. If the
switching/idle times must be minimized and a long period of full cycle needs to be employed, the fuel
level may need to be reduced so that the temperatures across the checkerwork can be maintained below
the maximum allowable level.

Case 3C – System of hot stoves with 𝑡cyc = 180 min, 𝑇bl,tr = 1000 ℃, and reduced fuel level
In this example, the full cycle duration of the hot-stove system is kept at 180 minutes, with the stoves
on-blast periods set to be the same as in Case 3A, but the fuel level is lowered. Simulations were run
using a fuel level factor of 0.95 and also by gradually decreasing the fuel factor from 1 to 0.9 throughout
the heating period. Both simulations generated practically the same results in terms of hot blast
temperature and checkerwork temperature profiles.
The dynamic evolution of the system is illustrated in Figure 4.25 and the predicted temperatures of the
hot blast and the checkerwork at quasi-steady state are shown in Figure 4.26 to Figure 4.28. Similar
with Case 3B, the predicted blast temperature at quasi-steady state can relatively be maintained at the
temperature target and the temperature deviations during the blast transition periods can be damped, as
depicted in Figure 4.26. The blast flow share profile shown in Figure 4.27 is also similar with that in
Case 3B (cf. Figure 4.23) in the sense that the stoves operate at a blast flow share close to one at the
end of the on-blast periods. Furthermore, it is seen in the bottom panel of Figure 4.28 that the
temperature of the solid at the cold end of the checkerwork can be maintained below 350 C despite the
180 minutes long full cycle period. Based on this, one may say that with suitable operating parameters,
the hot-stove system can adhere better to the blast temperature target as well as satisfy the operation
constraints.
Although the operation scenario in this case seems plausible, further elevating the overall 𝑇bl,end is still
the main goal, and this could potentially be achieved by operating at the maximum fuel level (in this
study, maximum fuel level factor was assumed to be 1) or by adding external fuel with higher heating
value. With this taken into consideration, a system of hot stoves with shorter full cycle length may be
preferable to prevent significant depletion of 𝑇bl,end over the on-blast period as well as to prevent
overheating of the checkerwork due to the long on-gas period.

Effect of the Stove On-blast Periods on the Final Blast Temperature
Similar to the hot-stove systems without bypass, different combinations of the stoves on-blast periods
give different overall system performance to the hot-stove systems with bypass. Here, a system with
the on-blast period for each stove ranging from 43-47 minutes and 𝑇bl,tr = 1000 ℃ is evaluated. The
min
min
predicted lowest 𝑇bl,end , or 𝑇bl,end
, are shown in Figure 4.29. Note that here 𝑇bl,end
reads the lowest
temperature of the final blast, which appears to be the blast temperature dip during the blast transition
min
max
periods, and 𝑇s,1
is the highest temperature reached by the cold ends of the checkerworks. Both 𝑇bl,end
max
and 𝑇s,1
are evaluated at quasi-stationary state operation.
Based on the evaluation, the higher final hot blast temperatures are achieved mostly in the region where
𝑡blast,1 > 𝑡blast,2 ≥ 𝑡blast,3 which in Figure 4.29 is the yellow region. In this favorable region, no
considerable differences are observed in the final blast temperatures. Thus, because of the bypass
configuration, the final blast temperatures in this region can be maintained relatively close to the target
most of the time, despite the occasional temperature spikes and falls during the blast transitions.
Nevertheless, the feasible solutions are limited by the checkerwork temperatures as depicted in Figure
4.30. In this case, for instance, the combination of 𝑡blast,1 = 45 min and 𝑡blast,2 = 44.67 min gives a
min
max
fairly decent 𝑇bl,end
≈ 962 ℃ and 𝑇s,1
≈ 273 ℃. Other combinations with shorter 𝑡blast,3 can give a
slight rise in 𝑇bl,end , but these may not be preferable as they come with considerably higher temperatures
at the checkerworks cold ends (cf. Figure 4.30).

Optimization Study of Hot-Stove System with Bypass

An optimization study of the hot-stove system with bypass was done through searching the local
maximum of the feasible final blast temperatures 𝑇bl,end by adjusting some contributing variables,
which in this work include the duration of the on-blast period for each stove (𝑡blast,𝑖 ), the final target
temperature (𝑇bl,tr ) and the share of external fuel, which in this study is coke oven gas. The fuel level
factor is not taken into account in this optimization study and thus assumed to be unity (maximum) in
the calculation for all combinations, since the main fuel for the hot-stove system is the blast furnace top
gas, the availability of which heavily depends on the operation state of the blast furnace.
While 𝑡blast,𝑖 can be considered as a variable that is bound to an individual stove, 𝑥COG and 𝑇bl,tr were
applied to the entire hot-stove system. For simplification and also due to some limitations related to the
compatibility of the computation code in running a fine local minimum search, in this optimization,
𝑡blast for the stoves were fixed at the values found from the evaluation in the previous section, which
are 45.00 min, 44.67 min, and 45.33 min for Stove 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The ranges of the other
variables in this study are defined below. The composition of coke oven gas used in this study is reported
in Table 4.6; the estimated heating value for it is 19 MJ/m3n.
0 ≤ 𝑥COG ≤ 0.035

To also study how the variables influence the hot-stove system, the value of the optimum 𝑥COG and
𝑇bl,tr were identified by generating solution profiles of the minimum 𝑇bl,end , 𝑇s at the checkerwork cold
end, and 𝑇s at the checkerwork hot end throughout the operation at quasi-steady state as depicted in
Figure 4.31, Figure 4.32, and Figure 4.33. Obviously, higher 𝑥COG and higher 𝑇bl,tr result in higher
𝑇bl,end . In addition, because of the small coke oven gas addition, the calculated temperature of the
combustion gas for any 𝑥COG in this optimization study is still relatively low. Therefore, no variable
combinations gave a predicted 𝑇s at the checkerwork hot end above 1300 C, as shown in Figure 4.33.
However, it is important to note that the resulting 𝑇bl,end is ideally at least the same as the target, 𝑇bl,tr ,
or in this case, is defined to be as close as possible to it. For instance, at (a maximum) 𝑥COG = 0.035
and 𝑇bl,tr = 1120 ℃, the lowest 𝑇bl,end = 1064℃, which is quite far lower than the targeted
temperature. This may indicate that the system cannot drive up to the targeted temperature steadily and
therefore this solution might not be favorable.

To ensure that the system is capable to run in a relatively stable manner, another constraint was imposed,
in which the deviation between 𝑇bl,end and 𝑇bl,tr is limited to be below 45 C. The defined limit of the
difference in this optimization study is quite big, but the temperature drops during the blast transition

phase are still inevitable in this simulation setup, nonetheless. The predicted 𝑇bl,end

Based on the results obtained in this evaluation and by considering a safe operating temperature for the
checkerwork, the optimum operating conditions for this problem is selected to be at 𝑥COG = 0.035 and
𝑇bl,tr = 1090 ℃. With this combination, the predicted minimum temperature of the final hot blast is
1047 C and the maximum temperature reached at the checkerwork cold end is 332 C. The addition of
this small amount of coke oven gas rises the combustion gas temperature to 1243 C.

Conclusions

A dynamic model for simulation of the operation of a hot-stove system has been developed and
evaluated in this work. Several cases were investigated to examine how the hot stoves characteristics,
the bypass configuration, and the system operation variables influence the behavior as well as the
performance of the entire stove system. In addition, a brief optimization problem with the goal to
achieve maximum blast temperature has been studied.
Based on the simulated cases of hot stoves without bypass, it was found that the lowest blast temperature
rises to a certain extent alongside with longer full cycle period, since the heating duration becomes
longer. In addition, in a simulated base case of a system of hot stoves with different characteristics and
without bypass, the results showed that the overall final blast temperature can be elevated by almost 30
C from the base point by only adjusting the on-blast periods for the stoves, i.e., by shortening the onblast period of the stove with lower efficiency and extending the on-blast period of the stove with better
efficiency. Due to the operation sequence, the hot stoves in the system are greatly interconnected, and
a change in the on-blast duration of an individual stove can give either an amplified effect or a
counterbalanced effect to the overall final blast temperature. Therefore, a solution profile of final blast
temperature was generated to evaluate the optimum hot stoves on-blast periods combination.
While the blast temperature from each stove decreases throughout its on-blast stage in the system
without bypass, it is possible for the final blast temperature to be maintained at a desired level in the
system by mixing the hot blast with bypass blast. Due to the diversion of a share of the blast flow, it is
natural for the hot stoves with bypass configuration to have the tendency in accumulating more heat,
resulting in higher checkerwork cold-end temperatures. Based on the tested cases, the maximum
allowable temperature at the checkerwork grid can be conformed, among other things, by operating at
shorter duration of system full cycle, setting higher blast target temperature, as well as reducing the
blast furnace top gas supply. As further elevating the final blast temperature is the main interest of this
work, a brief optimization study was performed to search for the point at which the blast temperature
target and the amount of coke oven gas used as additional fuel yields a feasibly high blast temperature
while at the same time the operation constraints are satisfied. As an illustrative figure, based on the
simulation results, the optimized operation of the system of hot stoves of different characteristics and
with bypass configuration enables a quite considerable final blast temperature increase of above 100
C, compared to the base case of the system without bypass nor any adjustments.
Although the simulations in this work were performed using a set of predefined parameters, the model
already considers the heat transfer phenomena and the interconnection between the stoves within the
system, thus giving reasonable insights of how changes in different operation parameters may affect the
overall performance of the hot-stove system. In the future, these parameters can be easily adjusted to
better adapt to a specific hot-stove system, which would allow for a more compatible simulation and
more accurate and applicable outputs. Nevertheless, there are still some simplifications taken in this
work model which can be relaxed in future work. The model in this work still assumes that the internal
combustion chambers in the hot stoves are fully insulated and that they do not account for any heat
transfer to the checkerworks. Additionally, the pressure losses in the gas and the blast flows are not yet
considered in the heat transfer calculation nor in the optimization problem. Another option for future
improvement of the model would be a refinement of the bypass controller model. In addition, the
possibility to include a self-preheating phase within the stove operation sequence can also be tested.
Rigorous operation optimization and investigation of strategies to operate in special operation cases,
such as two-stove operation, introduction of a stove after service period/revamping, and other dynamic
states would be beneficial to study in future work. Besides, the effectiveness of high emissivity coating
on the checkerwork channels surface in improving hot stove performance can also be theoretically
investigated. Furthermore, since the blast furnace and the hot-stove system operate in such
49

Religia Shaliha
interconnected and interdependent way, integrated simulation of blast furnace and hot-stove system
may also be interesting to explore.

Svensk sammanfattning

Modellering, simulering, och optimering av cowperdrift
Ett alternativ att minska energiförbrukningen vid järn- och stålproduktion är genom optimerad
cowperdrift. Cowprar är regenerativa motströmsvärmeväxlare som förser masugnen med ett
kontinuerligt flöde av förvärmd förbränningsluft (s.k. blästerluft) vid över 1000 C. Det finns vanligtvis
tre eller fyra cowprar per masugn. Cowperdriften är synnerligen dynamisk då den består av två växlande
huvudfaser, nämligen uppvärmning (”på gas”) och nedkylning (”på bläster”). Dessutom påverkar
driftparametrar och egenskaper hos en individuell cowper de andra cowprarna i systemet på grund av
den starka kopplingen mellan dessa.
Det är viktigt att uppnå en hög blästertemperatur vid masugndriften då det befrämjar
järnmalmsreduktionsprocessen i masugnen som i sin tur leder till ökat produktivitet. Dessutom minskar
behovet av koks eller andra bränslen, vilket leder till lägre CO2-utsläpp. En tumregel är att 10 C högre
blästerlufttemperatur minskar förbrukningen av koks i masugn med upp till 1 kg/ton råjärn. Därför är
det väldigt viktigt att studera och förstå cowpersystemet om man vill förbättra och effektivera
stålframställningsprocessen.
Syftet med detta diplomarbete var att bygga en modell som simulerar driften hos ett system av tre
cowprar som kan ha olika egenskaper och effektivitet. Modellen används som ett verktyg för att
undersöka några möjliga strategier för att uppnå optimala driftsprestanda med högre eller jämnare
blästertemperatur, vilket ger lägre konsumtion av koks och andra tilläggsbränslen i masugnen.
En dynamisk modell utvecklades utifrån grundläggande energibalanser och värmeöverföringsekvationer för gaserna (bläster och rökgaser) och murverket och implementerades därefter i MATLAB.
Modellen består av partiella differentialekvationer kopplade med en uppsättning algebraiska ekvationer.
Innan cowpersimuleringarna utfördes utvärderades en modell för förbränningen av masugns- och
koksugnsgas för att kunna simulera tillståndet hos gasen som matas in i cowprarna och som värmer upp
murverket under perioder då cowpern är ”på gas”, dvs. rökgasmängd, -temperatur och sammansättning.
Noggrannheten hos modellens energibalans utvärderades även med syftet att verifiera modellens
giltighet. Det visade sig att felen låg under 1% med den diskretisering i rum och tid som tillämpats,
vilket ansågs acceptabelt. Dessutom gjordes med modellen en analys av temperaturfördelningen i det
fasta materialet runt rökgaskanalerna som visade att den radiella temperaturen varierade marginellt
(endast med några grader), varför bara en rymddimension − den vertikala − beaktades i den slutliga
modellen.
Modellen utnyttjades för att studera fall där man undersökte hur cowprarnas egenskaper, förbikoppling
(eng. ”by-pass”) av bläster och driftvariabler inverkar på systemets prestanda. Simuleringarna som
gjordes lades upp enligt följande schema. Först simulerades ett system av cowprar med identiska
(fysiska) egenskaper och blästertider, utan förbikoppling. Flera cykeltider testades och det visar sig att
blästertemperaturen efter cowprarna i detta system ökade något vid längre cowpercykler. Därefter
utvärderades ett liknande system men för cowprar med olika termiska egenskaper. Systemet
simulerades med både identiska blästertider (såsom i basfallet) samt under varierande blästertider.
Resultatet visade att den slutliga blästertemperaturen kunde höjas med ca 30 C från baspunkten genom
att justera längden på cowprarnas cykler. Justeringarna som gav bättre resultat genomfördes genom att
förkorta blästertiden för en cowper med dålig prestanda samt förlänga blästertiden för en cowper med
god. En förändring av blästertiden för en individuell cowper kan ge antingen en amplifierad effekt eller
en motverkande effekt på den slutliga blästertemperaturen hos systemet. För att illustrera detta kopplade
förlopp skapades ett diagram som visar den slutliga blästertemperaturen och med hjälp av denna
grafiska representation kan man studera den optimala blästertidskonfigureringen hos cowprarna.
52

Religia Shaliha
System med förbikoppling av bläster simulerades också och resultaten visade att det är möjligt att
upprätthålla blästertemperaturen på en önskad nivå genom att blanda den uppvärmda blästerluften med
ouppvärmd bläster. Cowpersystemet med förbikoppling tenderar att ackumulera mer värme i murverket
som leder till en högre temperatur hos detta i den ”kalla” ändan. Denna region har vanligtvis
begränsningar för hur högt temperaturen tillåts öka av konstruktionstekniska skäl, men man fann att
driften kunde ske utan att begränsningarna överskreds genom att bl.a. förkorta tiden för cowpercykeln,
höja blästertemperaturens börvärde och minska tillförseln av gasformigt bränsle. En kort
optimeringsstudie utfördes även för att finna den högsta möjliga blästertemperaturen med beaktande av
samtliga driftbegränsningar. Variablerna som manipulerades i optimeringen var blästers börvärde och
mängden koksugnsgas som används som tilläggsbränsle i cowpersystemet. Optimering av systemet
med olika egenskaper och med förbikoppling av bläster möjliggjorde en blästertemperaturökning på
över 100 C i jämförelse med basfallet.
Modellen som utvecklades in detta arbete har beaktat värmeöverföringsfenomen och kopplingen mellan
cowprarna i systemet. Därför kan modellen ge en insikt i hur förändringar i olika driftparametrar
påverkar systemets prestanda. Trots att simuleringarna genomfördes med förbestämda parametrar kan
dessa parametrar enkelt justeras för att reflektera en specifik uppsättning cowprar. Emellertid har fler
förenklingar gjorts i detta arbete. Modellen beaktar endast värmeöverföringen till/från murverket medan
värmeflöde varken från eller till förbränningskammaren i cowpern har beaktats. Dessutom beaktas inte
heller tryckförlusten för rökgas- och blästerluftsflödet i värmeöverföringsberäkningarna eller i
cowperoptimeringen. En ytterligare möjlighet att förbättra simuleringarna är att finjustera regleringen
av förbikopplingen av bläster i modellen. Möjligheten att inkludera en förvärmningsperiod inom
cowperdriften kan också utvärderas i framtiden. En rigorös optimeringsstudie och utredning av
driftsstrategier under speciella förhållande, såsom två-cowperdrift, ibruktagande av en cowper efter en
underhållsperiod, och andra dynamiska tillstånd kan också vara fall som borde utforskas. Slutligen kan
det vara intressant att studera en integrerad simulering av masugn och cowprarna för att få förståelse
för hur de två processenheterna påverkar varandra.
