Title: Cost accounting methods supporting public sector organizations and
decision-making: an analysis of the Finnish rescue services
Supervisor: Matti Skoog
Abstract: Introduction: This thesis will examine the purchaser-provider model, a
governance model that has its origins in the New Public Management approach,
which is used by the Finnish Rescue Services, to understand how public sector
service organizations can develop their cost accounting methods to support the
purchaser-provider model. The purchaser-provider model needs precise cost
information of the providers' operations so that the services can be purchased for a
realistic price by the purchaser. The Finnish parliament's health and social services
reform will also initiate changes in the field of rescue services. The primary
funding responsibility for the rescue services would be transferred from the
municipalities to the state through the reform. Therefore, it is crucial to understand
how comparable the cost data between the rescue service departments are
currently. Method: The study in this thesis will be conducted as a case study of the
Finnish Rescue Services. The study aims to understand how the rescue service
departments could benefit from developing their cost accounting methods, as the
purchaser-provider model being used for the governance of the rescue service
departments requires accurate cost data for decision-making. Results: The financial
data were analyzed and presented in the form of figures to obtain an overall
understanding of the current economic situation of the regional rescue service
departments. The answers from the questionnaire were also analyzed and compared
to examine the cost data of the departments more thoroughly. Discussion: In the
analysis, variations in the cost data between the departments were identified.
Especially in the supporting activities, significant variations were found, as most of
the rescue service departments receive supporting activities from the owner
municipality. The municipality does not necessarily charge the department the total
price, or in some cases, anything at all, for these services. This can lead to hidden
costs within the municipality enterprise group, and that all the actual costs of the
departments are not present in the cost data. Therefore, the field of rescue services
should develop their reporting methods and create standardized methods for the
entire field so that the information is comparable and supports the decision-making
process. Based on the analysis, it also concluded that managerial and cost
accounting methods could serve public sector organizations and administrators by
providing valuable information for decision-making purposes.

1. Introduction
Many reforms in the public sector have been inspired and influenced by methods
originating from the New Public Management approach. For example, Kokko,
Auvinen, Sajasalo and Takala (2018) as well as Smith and Rauhut (2019), have studied
and found that the New Public Management approach has also influenced the Finnish
public sector, and that many reforms in Finland are to a certain degree based on the
governance methods and strategic goals of the New Public Management approach. The
health and social services reform proposed by the Finnish parliament is an example of
this approach and a reform inspired by New Public Management theories. The health
and social services reform suggests the creation of new welfare counties that take over
the responsibility of organizing and providing social and health care, as well as rescue
service operations. In this reform, the funding responsibility for the rescue services
would also be transferred from the municipalities to the state.
The purchaser-provider model is a governance method that originates from the New
Public Management approach. Especially within healthcare, this model has been
widely implemented and studied (Siverbo, 2004). The Finnish rescue services are also
governed by the purchaser-provider model, as the municipality is legally obliged to
organize rescue services in its assigned area, and the municipalities in Finland
purchase these rescue services from the local rescue service departments in accordance
with the purchaser-provider split model. The municipality and the local rescue service
department agrees on the provision of these services in the Service Standard
Agreement. (SM018:00/2012)
The purchaser-provider model requires accurate cost data to be able to calculate the
correct pricing for the services being purchased. Määttälä (2013) has studied the
economic state of the Finnish rescue services in 2010. Thereafter, little research
regarding the rescue services and their financial situation has been conducted.
Raulinajtys-Grzybek (2014) also highlights that for pricing based on cost information
to work, the cost data must be calculated using similar methods amongst all the
providers. Detailed knowledge regarding the cost structure and the cost drivers within

1

public sector services enables more focused policy making and better use of public
resources.
Therefore, this thesis will conduct a case study including the 22 Finnish rescue
services, which function under the local municipalities, to study the current state of
their financial reporting and costing methods, and to understand how these could be
developed. As little research has been conducted in the field of rescue services from
an economic standpoint, this study will provide valuable information regarding the
state of this. This study will also provide valuable insights into how public sector
service organizations can develop their costing methods, from a different standpoint
than previously studied, as these studies have often focused on similar issues but from
a healthcare perspective. The study is conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of
the Interior as a part of their research project Rescue Service and Civil Preparedness
Performance and Design Criteria (fin. Pelastustoimen ja siviilivalmiuden suorituskyky
ja suunnitteluperusteet–hanke).
The study in this thesis will be conducted as a financial analysis by analysing the
financial data of the Finnish rescue services. This will be carried out in combination
with a qualitative questionnaire that gathers information about the more precise costs
of the different rescue service departments, to understand the financial data of the
rescue service departments more profoundly and understand how this can be
developed. The financial data of the rescue service departments will also be compared,
to understand whether the financial data are comparable between the departments. As
Raulinajtys-Grzybek (2014) points out, it is important for the cost data to be calculated
in a similar manner between providers. By analyzing the situation of the Finnish rescue
services this thesis aims to provide insight into how public sector organizations,
especially those utilizing the purchaser-provider model, can benefit from the use of
costing methods.

1.1.

Background

Leading an organization through changes or changing environments requires
multifaceted information and awareness of the organization’s operations. Management

2

accounting and the information retrieved from accounting information can be utilized
in various ways by the management of an organization to help them make strategic
and well-informed decisions that steer the organization in the sought-after direction.
(Tammi, 2006)
Operations and finances are closely related aspects within organizations. The
management needs correct information about the costs of the operations so that the
costs can be monitored and controlled. This is necessary for the financial management
of an organization. In these situations, cost accounting and different managerial
accounting methods can help the management of organizations gather useful
information about the organization’s operations that can be used for decision-making
and management. Cost accounting focuses on where in the operations the costs are
caused and understanding the costs of the operations better. By focusing on where the
costs of the operations originate, the management can expose possible challenges in
the operations of the organization, and therefore, this information can bring value to
the management of the organization. (Määttälä, 2013)
The public sector in Finland is facing significant changes through the health and social
services reform that aims to redefine the structure of the social welfare and health care
service system in Finland (Finnish institute for health and welfare, 2020). The reform
will cause substantial changes to the social welfare and health care field in Finland.
Therefore, the management of the organizations in this field will have to lead the
organizations through this reform and ensure that the operations and services provided
will meet the quality standards and yet remain efficient and operate effectively.
The 22 rescue service regions in Finland are responsible for organizing and
maintaining the rescue service operations within their region. These independent
rescue services function under the local municipalities, which govern the local rescue
services (STM055:00/2019). Through the health and social services reform, the
Finnish state is aiming to redefine the rescue service and, in this way, improve the
service that the local rescue services can provide. Through the health and social
services reform, the executive power of the state is strengthened regarding the
independent rescue services and municipalities, and the state’s governance over the
rescue services will be amplified. This reform aims to provide more streamlined and
3

equal rescue services nationwide, which is achieved by strengthening the state’s
governance of the independent rescue services. The health and social services reform
would move the responsibility of the rescue services from the municipalities to the
larger welfare counties defined in the health and social services reform.
(STM055:00/2019)
There is little extensive research on the financial aspects of the rescue services in
Finland. The Finnish National Rescue Association (SPEK) conducted a research
project in 2010 analyzing the current situation of the Finnish rescue services. In this
research project, Jaana Määttälä conducted a financial analysis of the rescue services
for 2007-2010. This study was conducted to obtain a more solid base for decisionmaking than before regarding the rescue service field in Finland. The research project
also conducted an overall analysis of the rescue service in Finland. It provided
information about the function of the rescue services, statistics about their operations
and assets, information about their financial situation and cost structure, and human
resources. (Mankkinen, 2013)
As the field of rescue service in Finland focuses on providing rescue services for the
population, the focus on financial and economic aspects has not been a priority in the
field. There are limited studies and research conducted on the economic situation and
development of the rescue services in Finland. After the study by Jaana Määttälä for
the (Mankkinen, 2013) research project, no further financial or economic studies have
been conducted to analyze the financial situation of the rescue services. The field is
therefore lacking in studies about the current financial situation of the rescue services,
according to Jaana Määttälä from The Ministry of the Interior’s Department for Rescue
Services (personal communication, 8 October 2020).
Economic and financial information is vital in every field of business when it comes
to decision-making (Cepêda & Monteiro, 2020). Therefore, this type of information is
of value to the rescue services and their administrators. It will help in the decisionmaking process and provide a more substantial knowledge base for decision-making.

Problem

Globally many factors influence changes in the public sector environment. The public
sector organizations must learn to operate in a continuously changing field, where the
business landscape is under constant changes and challenges (ACCA, 2016). To
manage the public sector organizations effectively and ensure the quality of the
services they provide, it is of great importance that the management of public sector
organizations utilizes various information sources to support the decision-making
processes. Thus, management accounting systems that give insight into the operations
of the organizations can help the leaders do this.
As the health and social services reform in Finland will initiate changes to the rescue
service field (STM055:00/2019), it is beneficial to analyze the current use of cost
accounting methods and the financial information. Moreover, it is essential to look at
how these methods can be utilized more efficiently and how they can be improved.
Thorough knowledge about the financial performance and situation of the rescue
service is of great importance before making substantial changes in the field, as
economic factors provide valuable information to decision-makers about the
performance and operations of the business (Cepêda & Monteiro, 2020). Through the
health and social services reform, the executive power of the state would also be
strengthened. Therefore, it is relevant to understand whether the financial data and
reporting of the 22 rescue service departments are comparable and how the current
situation looks. Without taking economic perspectives into account when making
changes to the operations and processes of the rescue services, new decisions could
harm the operations if they have not considered the operations from all crucial aspects.
As Lewis (1960) states, the purpose of financial analysis is to analyze the financial
information and transform it into a format that management can use for decisionmaking, making sure that the management of an organization understands the
accounting information. Moreover, this thesis aims to analyze how the public sector
and field of rescue services can improve the utilization of cost accounting information
and managerial accounting procedures to support the organizations' management and
ensure effective and strategic leadership that ensures the quality of the rescue services.

5

The purchaser-provider split between the municipality and the local rescue service
department means that the municipality purchases the rescue services from the rescue
service department for a set price. The problem that occurs is how they can verify what
the purchased services cost and what their price is.

1.3.

Purpose of the study

The purpose of this thesis is to study how public sector service organizations
implementing the purchaser-provider model can develop their cost accounting
methods to support decision-making. As the purchaser-provider model, a governance
method originating from the New Public Management approach needs accurate cost
data to make correct and realistic pricing decisions. Therefore, functioning cost
accounting methods are necessary for this governance model.
The study in this thesis will be conducted as a case study of the rescue services in
Finland to analyze the current economic state and state of the financial reporting
methods of the rescue services in Finland and their used cost accounting methods. By
conducting a case study, this thesis aims to determine if the costing methods used
within this field serve their purpose or how these could be developed to obtain more
valuable information for decision-making through cost accounting methods. As the
purchaser-provider split calls for accurate cost data to support pricing decisions, this
thesis aims to analyze whether this information, particularly the connection between
the operations and the price of these, can be retrieved from the information used for
decision-making in the negotiations. As the methods used within the rescue services
in Finland have not been reviewed systematically in the past decade, and there is a lack
of financial studies within this field, it is necessary to analyze the situation to
understand it more profoundly to develop it.
By analyzing the field of rescue services in Finland through this case study, this thesis
also aims to determine how public sector service organizations can benefit from cost
accounting methods and greater cost awareness and, with the help of this information,
improve the management and strategic leadership of the organizations.

6

The research questions for this study are the following:
-

What is the current economic state of the Finnish rescue service and the local

rescue service departments regarding their financial reporting methods?
-

Is the financial and economic information received from the local rescue services

serving its purpose to function as a base for decision-making and management in the
municipalities who are the purchasers of the rescue services?
-

How can the Finnish public sector rescue services develop their financial

information to support decision-making more thoroughly?
This thesis aims to obtain a thorough overview of the current situation of the rescue
services in Finland and understand how the rescue service departments could develop
their financial information used for decision-making through the research questions
mentioned above.

1.4.

Limitations of the study

This study will examine the local rescue services operating in Finland under the local
municipality, and therefore, this study is limited to Finnish rescue services only. In this
thesis, only the rescue service organizations and their operations will be analyzed to
understand how they can benefit from cost accounting and cost-based pricing methods.
As the study object is the rescue services field alone, the results are only based on the
rescue services and their situation. However, the results could indicate how other
public sector service organizations with similar operations and administration could
benefit from similar methods.
The Service Standard Decision that works as the framework defining the operations
and service level of the local rescue services contains other operational aspects as well.
However, for this thesis, the financial side of this will be focused on.

2. Public Sector Municipal Organizations in Finland
In this chapter, relevant background theory will be presented to provide the foundation
for the theoretical framework for this thesis. Theory about municipal public sector
organizations and their governance will be discussed, as well as the Finnish rescue
services and their financial structure will be presented. Furthermore, information about
the health and social services reform and how this reform will affect the rescue services
will be considered.

2.1.

Municipal public sector organizations

Public sector municipal organizations differ from private sector organizations as they
are a not-for-profit type of organizations, and therefore their primary goals are
different from profit-oriented organizations. The function and purpose of public sector
organizations are defined in legislation regarding their primary activities (Tammi,
2006). For example, the Rescue Act (379/2011) defines the rescue service’s primary
activities and operations, which they are required to perform by law.
Even though public sector organizations are non-profit organizations, this does not
mean that these organizations do not have any financial or economic goals in place.
As public sector organizations are funded by public means, it is expected that the
operations of these organizations are produced and conducted cost-effectively, with
often-times strict spending budgets, as the public means are limited and supposed to
be sufficient for many purposes. (Tammi, 2006; Association of Finnish Municipalities,
2021)
As municipal organizations have not aspired to be profit-maximizing organizations,
they have not experienced the same need as profit-oriented organizations to develop
functioning cost accounting systems. As the municipal public sector organizations are
operating in a changing environment, this fact has changed, which requires cost
accounting methods to lead these organizations in this environment. (Tammi, 2006)

9

As the municipalities in Finland purchase the rescue services from the local rescue
services through the purchaser-provider model, accurate cost information is needed to
base pricing decisions. To be able to retrieve accurate cost information, cost
accounting methods are needed to gather this information.

2.2.

Public sector and municipal financial reporting in Finland

As the regional rescue services function under the municipalities, they function in the
public sector and are funded by public means by tax incomes. Therefore, public sector
corporations funded by public means are obliged to report in the financial statements
how the public means have been spent and to which posts and expenses they have been
allocated. (Luoma, Oulasvirta & Näsi, 2007, p. 37)
The requirements for the financial reporting of municipal organizations are defined by
the Municipal Section of the Accounting Board that operates under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Employment. The requirements are defined in the general
instructions regarding the financial statements of municipalities and joint municipal
authorities

(fin. Yleisohje

kunnan

ja

kuntayhtymän

tilinpäätöksen

ja

toimintakertomuksen laatimisesta) (Association of Finnish Municipalities, 2020).
The purpose of the financial statements of the municipalities, or joint municipal
authorities, is to give an accurate and fair view of the organization’s financial situation
in the same manner as for private sector organizations. In the Local Government Act
(410/2015), it is prescribed that the following aspects should be included in the
financial statements of municipalities: a balance sheet, income statement, and cash
flow statement, with appended notes, as well as a budget review and a report on
operations. In addition to this, the municipalities that compose a local authority
corporation together with the municipality’s subsidiaries must compose consolidated
financial statements. The municipality must include a review of the internal control
and essential identified needs for development in the report on operations.
The aim of the general instructions regarding the requirements for the financial
reporting made by the Municipal Section of the Accounting Board is to improve the

10

comparability of the municipalities’ financial statements and reports by standardizing
their contents and structure and the format in which these are presented. (Association
of Finnish Municipalities, 2020).

2.3.

New Public Management, management accounting and the public
sector in Finland

In the late 20th century, the criticism towards the inefficient management of public
sector organizations led to a movement known as New Public Management. In this
approach, influences from the private sector were introduced in the management of
public sector organizations to tackle the challenges that were related to the traditional
public sector management style. Themes from the private sector, such as privatization,
decentralization, and goal-oriented management styles, were introduced to the
management of public sector organizations to improve the public sector's
effectiveness. (Van Helden, 2005)
New Public Management is hence a management method that draws its inspiration
from management methods that traditionally originate from the private sector business
environment. These have been introduced in public sector organizations for
management purposes through the New Public Management approach, and thereby
this approach has influenced public sector administrative reforms. (Dunleavy & Hood,
1994)
New Public Management methods are believed to be a way of achieving improved
effectiveness in the public sector. They have, therefore, been considered a functioning
tool for these organizations and their management and organization. In Finland,
influences from the New Public Management approach have led to reforms and
reconstructions of the public sector and how the services provided by the public sector
actors are organized and administrated. Therefore, even the Finnish public sector
developments have drawn inspiration from New Public Management. Many reforms
regarding the administration of public sector services have gone towards methods
familiar from New Public Management, so this can be seen as a force influencing the
public sector and its reforms in Finland. (Kokko, Auvinen, Sajasalo & Takala, 2018)

11

Smith and Rauhut (2019) have studied the implementation of New Public Management
in Finland and public sector reforms. The authors (Smith & Rauhut, 2019) concluded
that a weakened form of New Public Management had been implemented in Finland,
with national concerns considered in the implementation, instead of following a
globally agreed approach for implementation. Clear influences from the New Public
Management approach implemented in the Finnish public sector are service efficiency
promotion and the competition aspect.
Lægreid and Christensen (2007) have also examined post-New Public Management
reforms that have taken place after the end of the 20th century. Some researchers have
suggested that the era of New Public Management reforms is over. In contrast, other
researchers believe that New Public Management is not over, but it has evolved and
changed into new forms of reforms. Lægreid and Christensen (2007) state that they
believe in the changed form of New Public Management reforms. Therefore, the earlier
forms of New Public Management reforms have set the foundation for the new version
of New Public Management.
Lægreid and Christensen (2007) discuss the fact that the demand for transparency has
risen, and more elaborated reports on, for example, performance and organizational
arrangements are requested. The value for transparency is also prominent in the
Finnish public sector and its organizations, which are expected to be transparent about
their operations and spending (Moisio, 2015).
Cuganesan, Dunford, and Palmer (2012) have also studied strategic management
accounting in the public sector, and how the pressure from reforms in the public sector
has highlighted the need for strategic management in the public sector as well, which
traditionally is considered a management style from the private sector.
The management style of New Public Management has also received some criticism,
like all variants of management systems have. Dunleavy and Hood (1994) highlight
that there is most likely not one New Public Management model that globally suits all
public sectors, but various versions of this model are designed to suit different
concerns and needs. Also, Zia and Zeb Khan (2014) discuss some of the criticism that
12

New Public Management practices have received. One major aspect of criticism
directed towards New Public Management is that private sector and public sector
organizations are different in their primal nature and that this could weaken the public
sector and its core values and principles. In the public sector, the organizations'
external forces often influence the organizations' management systems. Therefore,
these tools might not be as effective in these organizations, as they might not be as free
to decide on performance measurement and accountability as private sector
organizations, which are not influenced by political forces in the same manner.

2.4.

Rescue Service in Finland

The scope and duties of the rescue services authorities in Finland are prescribed in the
Rescue Act (379/2011). This act presents general duties and provisions for all
individuals, corporations, and organizations in society, not merely legislation for the
rescue service authorities, as there are obligations to follow regarding preventive,
preparing, and limiting measures and the duty to act in case of an emergency.
The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for directing and steering the rescue services
and has the oversight responsibility regarding the quality and extent of the services.
The Ministry of the Interior is also responsible for the organization of rescue services
on a national level and ensuring preparedness. It is also in charge of the coordination
of different parties within the field of rescue services and other provisions given by
the government regarding the rescue services if needed. (379/2011)
There are also regional state administrative agencies responsible, among other things,
for supervision and oversight of the local rescue services and ensuring that the quality
and coverage are on an acceptable level within their area of responsibility. (379/2011)
The municipalities are responsible for the rescue services, and this responsibility is
shared within the rescue service regions that the government defines. The
municipalities that are part of a rescue service region must have a consensus on how
the rescue service is organized within their rescue service region. (379/2011)

13

Within the rescue service region, there must be a rescue department that executes and
performs the rescue service duties of this regional rescue service. Assistance from
contract fire brigades or other rescue service organizations is allowed if there is an
agreement on the execution of the operations. (379/2011)
The regional rescue services are responsible for the standard of the rescue service and
must provide proper guidance and information within their area of responsibility. This
aims to help prevent accidents and fires, prepare for appropriate action in situations of
accidents, and, therefore, limit the possible consequences the accidents may cause.
Moreover, the regional rescue departments oversee the labor conducted as a part of the
rescue operations and the warning of the population in dangerous situations that
require this. In some cases, additional tasks are carried out by the rescue departments
if agreed upon or ordered by the government. For example, the rescue departments can
also conduct emergency medical care tasks and oil spill response tasks. (379/2011)
Figure 1 summarizes the distribution of power between the rescue service departments,

Figure 1: The distribution of power between the actors in the Finnish Rescue Service

In Figure 1, the distribution of power between the actors in charge of the Rescue
Services in Finland is exemplified. In the figure, the flow of power is visualized by the
arrows between the actors. The size of the arrow shows the amount of power that flows
between the actors. Thus, it represents the relation of power and how power is carried
out in the field. (Haiko & Paloposki, 2007, p. 9)
The municipalities have a substantial role, and therefore, the main flow of power is
between the municipality (The Owner or Purchaser) and the rescue departments (The
Provider). Strong relations are also found between the ministry (The Regulator) and
the municipality. The municipalities have a strong position as they are obliged by law,
the Rescue Act, to ensure the provision of rescue services. There is a relation between
the rescue department and the ministry, but this power flow is weaker than between
the ministry and the municipality. (Haiko & Paloposki, 2007, p. 9)
In the figure, the organizations that are active in the field of rescue services are also
included, but this actor has the weakest flow of power to the other actors. The
organizations are responsible for the development and supporting development tasks,
and therefore they have the least amount of power compared to other actors. (Haiko &
Paloposki, 2007, p. 10)
2.4.1. Service Standard Decision

The local rescue services function under the local municipality, and the municipality
is responsible for governing the organizations. The local rescue services and the
municipality

negotiate

a

Service

Standard

Decision

agreement

(fin. palvelutasopäätös) for a fixed term. This contract between the municipality and
the rescue service department is the agreement that sets the foundation for the fixed
period. According to this contract, the local rescue services operate during the fixed
term. (SM018:00/2012)
The service level contract is created based on the framework that contains guidelines
for the Service Standard Decision (fin. Ohje palvelutasopäätöksen sisällöstä ja
rakenteesta) (SM018:00/2012) set by the Ministry of the Interior that was published
in 2013. This framework is based on the legal requirements set for the rescue services

15

in the Rescue Act. It defines how the rescue services construct the Service Standard
Decision to take care of the activities that are legally required in agreement with the
municipality. The local rescue service department is the services provider, and the
municipality is the purchaser of the services. The Service Standard Decision is defined
after the rescue services have reached an agreement regarding the service level with
the municipality and Regional State Administrative Agency. (SM018:00/2012)
In the Service Standard Decision, the following aspects should be considered:
- Analysis of the current Service Standard Decision period
- Estimating threats and risks in the local rescue service department region and the
activities and resources needed to operate as legally required of the rescue services
with the threats and risks considered. The goals and necessary performance are defined
based on the risk analysis and estimation.
- Conclusions that can be drawn from the previous period’s development plan
(SM018:00/2012)
In addition to the legally required activities that the rescue services need to perform,
the rescue services can be responsible for other activities as well. These can be such
as first aid services, if this is agreed upon with the local hospital district per the Health
Care

Act,

international

operations,

or

contingency

planning

activities.

(SM018:00/2012)
In the development plan, the rescue service should define how the services will be
developed to meet the requirements of a changing operating environment. In this part,
the costs for the activities on the development plan should be estimated, and these
assessed for the time the contract is valid. (SM018:00/2012)
When negotiating for the Standard Service Decision, the municipalities should utilize
all the available information regarding the operations of the rescue services and their
financial situation. For example, financial statements, quarterly reports, operational
and financial monitoring reports, and the last term’s Standard Service Decision are
considered. (SM018:00/2012)

16

Moreover, it is essential for the agreement regarding Service Standard Decision
between the rescue services and the municipality that the costs for the services are
known. Cost awareness is necessary so that the prices for the services can be set
accordingly and realistically.
As the municipality purchases the rescue services from the local rescue service
department in exchange for a set price, the problem is how the municipalities and
rescue services can verify the costs for these services.

2.5.

Purchaser-provider split

The municipalities and local rescue service departments agree on providing the rescue
services in the Service Standard Decision agreement. The municipality is responsible
for organizing the rescue services in their assigned area per the Rescue Act (397/2011).
The municipality purchases the rescue services from the regional rescue service
department, which provides these services to the municipality. Hence, the service
delivery is organized by the purchaser-provider model, in which the municipality is
the purchaser and the rescue service department the provider.
The purchaser-provider split is a model with its origins from the private sector and
market-inspired management models that fall under New Public Management.
Especially within healthcare, New Public Management models have been
implemented widely to increase service production efficiency. The purchaser-provider
model has been favored within this field, as it can be used to create an internal market,
competition, and market incentives, which are hoped to lead to increased efficiency.
(Siverbo, 2004)
The relation between the purchaser and the provider is based on contracts and the
management and evaluation of these. The services purchased from the providers are
managed by contracts in which the agreed-upon assignments are stated. Later an
evaluation of the performance of these is conducted. (Siverbo, 2004)

17

Tynkkynen, Keskimäki, and Lehto (2013) have discussed the purchaser-provider split
within Finnish healthcare. The purchaser-provider split is a service delivery model that
has been used in Finland in the delivery of both health care services and elderly care
services, and different variations of this model have been used internationally for
service delivery. In this service delivery model, the payers, or purchasers of the
services, in this model public third parties, are separated from the providers of the
services in an organized manner. Contracts manage the operations that the provider
produces for the purchasers. By having the service delivery organized with this model,
it is believed that, for example, cost containment, improved efficiency, flexibility, and
responsiveness can be achieved. Thus, it is considered a functioning model that can
lead to improvements. This is partly because of the competition it creates between
service providers, leading to increased efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and quality.
Another aspect that can be seen as a positive aspect is the assumption that the purchaser
of the services can express the services’ demands and quality and make decisions
based on this information more effectively than previously.
The internal purchaser-provider split created by this model within the municipality
administration is based mainly on the concept of “management by results” and,
therefore, creating fictional markets within the municipal administration. This concept
builds on the thought that service providers need more independence from the
administration and decision-making to provide their services innovatively and
efficiently. Another aspect of this model is the incorporation of service providers from
the private sector in the service delivery of public services, so-called contracting out.
The incorporation of these solutions varies locally but is increasing. By incorporating
these private sector service providers, the competition between the service providers
is often enhanced, leading to quality development and efficiency of service provision.
(Tynkkynen, Keskimäki & Lehto, 2013)
Tynkkynen, Keskimäki, and Lehto (2013) also discuss that the purchaser-provider
split within health and social services in Finland has no specific regulatory legalization
and is considered in the same manner as public procurement in Finland. The authors
highlight that this could cause negative consequences for the quality of service. One
reason for problems is a limited understanding for the drafting of the contract between
the parties and defining the prices for the health care and social welfare services.
18

As the local rescue services and the municipalities that govern them organize the
rescue services according to this model, the concepts raised by Tynkkynen, Keskimäki,
and Lehto (2013) are relevant for this thesis. The authors raise the possible problem
that can arise if proper knowledge regarding the costs of services is not known to a
sufficient degree. Insufficient knowledge can lead to distorted decisions regarding the
service level agreements between the purchaser and provider, as the costs of the
produced services are central to this contract-making process.

2.6.

The health and social services reform

The Finnish government has proposed a reform to the Finnish parliament regarding
creating new welfare counties (fin. sote-maakunnat), which would take over the
responsibility of organizing social and health care and rescue services from the
municipalities that have this responsibility now. (STM055:00/2019)
This reform aims to reduce inequalities within health care and welfare and increase
safety by guaranteeing equal quality and availability of social, health care, and rescue
services. The reform also aims to ensure that a professional workforce is available and
that the services can respond and adapt to changes in society in a proper manner and
control and curb the costs that these services cause. (STM055:00/2019)
The proposal suggests creating 21 welfare counties in Finland that would take over
organizing the social and health care services and the rescue services. The
responsibility of organizing these services has previously been on the municipalities.
The welfare counties would be public organizations that would be autonomous within
their area. The responsibility of the organization of the rescue services would be
transferred to the autonomous welfare counties. (STM055:00/2019)
The welfare counties and their operations would mainly be funded by the state, which
means that the funding responsibility would shift from the municipalities to the state.
The operations would also partly be funded by customer fees collected from the users
of the services. The funding would be regulated in the funding law for the health and

19

social services (fin. sote-rahoituslaki). When it comes to the rescue services, the risk
factor of the area would also affect the funding. As the state’s funding responsibility
would grow, the state’s personal income tax rate would be raised. However, the
municipalities would be obliged to reduce their municipal tax rate so that the overall
tax rate would not grow. This means that the state’s incomes would be increased at the
same rate that the incomes of the municipalities would be reduced, as the funding
responsibility shifts from the municipalities to the state. The responsibility of
organizing the rescue services and related services would be moved to the welfare
counties from the beginning of the year 2023. (STM055:00/2019)
As the primary funding responsibility for the rescue services would shift from the
municipalities to the state because of the health and social services reform, the need
for comparable financial information also increases, especially regarding the costs of
the services, as this information functions as a base for pricing decisions. Therefore,
the need for comparable cost data from the regional rescue service departments will
be amplified through the health and social services reform.
2.6.1. Intermunicipal contracts and public partnerships in local service provision

Silvestre, Marques, Dollery, and Correia (2019) have studied the effect of cooperation
in public partnerships on costs and if this type of cooperation reduces costs. Public
markets are also facing the need to produce services cost-effectively due to financial
constraints. The financial constraints have led to the use of, for example, intermunicipal contracts and public partnerships to provide local services with the most
cost-efficient methods. Overall, the authors found that these types of cooperative
partnerships reduce the costs of providing local services. (Silvestre, Marques, Dollery,
& Correia, 2019)
As the health and social services reform in Finland also aims to reduce costs and
provide better quality local services for the population equally, this research provides
valuable insight into a similar issue. It supports the idea of cooperation and agreements
between municipalities regarding the provision of local services, instead of every
municipality only being responsible for its local services. However, as the current
situation in Finland is that the municipalities have the primary responsibility of

20

providing the determined local services, cooperation and agreements between
municipalities have been allowed from before. The cooperation has been allowed, for
example, in the form of joint municipal authorities, so, therefore, this phenomenon
would not be an entirely new notion in Finland either because of the health and social
services reform (Statistics Finland, n.d.).

2.7.

Finnish National Rescue Association SPEK-study

The Finnish National Rescue Association (SPEK) (Mankkinen, 2013) conducted a
project to analyze the current situation of the Finnish rescue services during the years
2010 and 2011. The project had several subprojects, based on which two publications
were released. The first publication (fin. 24/365 Palokuntalaisuus Suomessa)
(Mankkinen, 2013, p. 10) focuses on the history and development of the rescue
services, and the second publication (fin. Pelastustoimen tilinpäätös – Analyysi
suomalaisen pelastustoimen nykytilasta) (Mankkinen, 2013, p. 10) focuses on the
operations, resources, and finances of the rescue services.
Määttälä (2013, p. 183) conducted a financial statement analysis of the regional rescue
services for this project by SPEK. The study aimed to analyze especially the costs
allocated to the rescue services over the years 2007-2010, as well as analyzing other
financial information from the financial statements and balance sheets from the same
period, for example, to gain knowledge about the costs of specific tasks that are defined
in the Rescue Act.
The study by Määttälä (2013, p. 184) was conducted as a field study between 2010
and 2012. The empirical material was gathered using a survey and observations,
personal communication, and information from previous research and development
projects. In addition, the financial reports and statements of the main actors within the
field of rescue services in Finland were analyzed and statistics from Pronto, which is
the database for statistics over the Rescue Services in Finland.
The regional rescue services in Finland were divided into four control groups accepted
and divided by the rescue service departments and the Association of Finnish

21

Municipalities based on statistics from Statistics Finland about regional population
density and demographic change and development from the year 2008. The differences
in the size of the regional rescue services cause variations to, for example, their
operations and finances. Therefore, it is sensible to analyze the regional rescue services
within their vicinity regarding operational and financial ratios. (Määttälä, 2013, p. 185)
Määttälä (2013, p. 185) examined the financial statements of the regional rescue
services during the four years, and from this derived, for instance, percentual
differences and similarities between the regional rescue service departments and the
four control groups, as well as monetary differences and similarities between these
groups.
Määttälä (2013) found that the total costs for the rescue services in Finland were on
average 420 million euros throughout 2007-2010. In this calculation, the regional
rescue services, the Ministry of the Interior’s Department for Rescue Services, the
Emergency Services College, the Fire Protection Fund, the regional state
administration agencies, the Finnish National Rescue Association (SPEK) and other
rescue service associations, the Finnish Association of Fire Chiefs (SPPL), the
Federation of Finnish Contract Fire Brigades (SSPL), the Central Association of
Chimney Sweeps and enterprises within the chimney-sweeping field are included. The
total costs for the rescue services include costs allocated to tasks defined in the Rescue
Act and associated tasks, as well as costs allocated to emergency medical care. Most
costs stemmed from tasks related to the Rescue Act in the largest rescue service
departments and operations relating to these tasks. In total, the rescue services
allocated a total of 351 million euros per year to the costs of tasks per the Rescue Act
and related activities (Määttälä, 2013, p. 269-270).
The previous study regarding the current state of the rescue services in Finland is
considered in this study, as a financial analysis was conducted in the study, analyzing
the economic state of the regional rescue services during the studied period. Määttälä
(2013) found that the rescue services field could benefit from developing their cost
accounting methods further and include more accounting information as a base for
decision-making. The current economic state of the regional rescue service

22

departments will be considered in this thesis to gain knowledge about how this
situation has evolved.

23

3. Accounting information for decision-making
In this chapter, literature about the use of accounting information in decision-making
is addressed. Moreover, management accounting literature will be presented and its
role in the public sector. In addition, literature regarding cost accounting and different
cost accounting systems will be presented, as well as their usefulness in the public
sector will be discussed. Literature on the role of financial information in decisionmaking will also be presented as it will serve as a framework for this thesis.

3.1.

Accounting information in decision-making

Using accounting information internally in organizations for activities such as
planning, control, evaluation, and decision-making is called management accounting.
Management accounting aims to provide necessary information for management and
decision-makers to ensure that they can make informed decisions and utilize resources
effectively. (Hansen & Mowen, 2006)
When managers are in the decision-making process, they usually adopt a personal
perspective that affects their choices. The task of accounting information is to provide
relevant information and data to support and guide the decision-making process. To
evolve the business processes of an organization and improve the profitability of
operations, managers can seek to better time-based performance, efficiency, and
quality. To support these agendas and goals, the managers need accounting
information about the business processes to learn about the performance and
operations. (Horngren, Bhimani, Datar & Foster, 2002; Hansen & Mowen, 2006)
It has been found that financial analysis and the analysis of financial statements
provide valuable information to managers in business decision-making processes. The
information retrieved from financial statement analysis provides valuable insights into
the performance of the business and its efficiency, which is essential information in
business decision-making processes (Ježovita, 2015). Also, Nasiripour, Ashlagi,
Tabibi, Maleki, and Gorji (2012) have concluded that it is seen as an essential function

24

of managers to evaluate the business's financial performance to make correct and wellinformed decisions that preserve the productivity and supervision of the organization.
Cepêda and Monteiro (2020) have found that financial information plays a vital role
in decision-making within every field of business, as it provides crucial information
about the business's financial performance that can be used for making future business
decisions.
Pellinen (2003) highlights that one of the main functions of accounting is to provide
information about the financial performance and efficiency of a business. Depending
on what type of information is needed, the financial situation can be analyzed through
various methods. Pellinen (2003) emphasizes that accounting information is vital in
decision-making processes and periods when the leaders in an organization are making
decisions considering the organization's future from economic perspectives and aiming
to steer the organization properly from a financial standpoint.
When analyzing the financial statements and information of an organization, it is
crucial to have a focus on large entries that are crucial for the business of the
organization in question, keeping, for example, the field of business and strategy in
mind, as these have a significant impact on the financial performance and position of
the business (Seppänen, 2011).
Lewis (1960) states that financial analysis is a method that organizations can use to
help the management in decision-making processes. The management can use the
accounting information to steer the organization towards greater profits and goals. The
function of the financial analysis is to make the accounting information valuable for
all the users of this information so that the financial information can be utilized for the
decision-making process, and it can give insights to management when it comes to
different decisions and options.
Hopwood (1972) has studied the role accounting information has in evaluating an
organization's performance and different evaluation styles, and their impact on
managerial performance and behavior. The author highlights that accounting
information and systems are made to provide managers with data that helps their
25

decision-making and enables managers to make decisions aligned with the
organization's goals. Hopwood (1972) also states that the standard accounting reports
of an organization can be utilized in various manners to evaluate the organization's
performance. The accounting data can be given different meanings and interpreted
differently by managers, for example, by combining it with other sources of
information that support the data from other aspects. For example, a department's
actual costs and budgeted costs can be analyzed to evaluate the performance, even
though this analysis often only gives insight into the short-term performance and does
not necessarily speak for the long-term success. In his study, Hopwood (1972)
analyzes different evaluative styles that managers use to evaluate performance. The
difference in this lies in the use of budgetary information for performance evaluation
and how this information is used.
Otley and Fakiolas (2000) also discuss the use and relevance of accounting information
to evaluate the performance of an organization. The authors (Otley & Fakiolas, 2000)
have focused on measuring the scope of ways to define dimensions of evaluative styles
and different accounting performance measures.
Virtanen, Stenvall, and Rannisto (2015) have also discussed Finnish public
management and how the public administration has traditionally been developed and
improved using information as a base for decision-making. Even though there are long
traditions regarding leading and developing strategies with the help of information,
they still highlight this being a constant challenge for management. Leading with the
help of information and knowledge requires efforts in the daily work, planning, and
operations. Therefore, leading with knowledge is a constant effort that should be a part
of administrative work in the public sector.
Significantly as the operating environment for public sector organizations faces
changes faster all the time, the need for knowledge as a base for decision-making is
amplified constantly. Therefore, leading with knowledge and the importance of
information as a base for decision-making should be considered essential in all
management work in the public sector. (Virtanen, Stenvall & Rannisto, 2015)

26

3.2.

Cost accounting

As previously stated, one of the primary roles of accounting is to report reliable
information about economic resources to decision makers, so that they are equipped
with relevant information about the business to be able to make educated decisions
and manage economic resources properly (Bettner, 2015). Managerial accounting and
cost accounting are focused on fulfilling the information demands of internal users
both in public sector and private sector organizations (Rivenback, 2005).
A fundamental fact is that a well-managed business and cost awareness go hand in
hand. Within all business sectors, it is in the interest of the organization’s management
to create realistic strategies and have functioning tools to measure the achievement of
the set goals and performance from financial aspects. The management of an
organization needs to have tools and methods that measure, for example, the
organization’s activities, influences from the external market and responsibilities of
managers in economic terms, so that this information can be used as a base for
planning, decision-making and controlling. To enable this and gather the necessary
financial data the management will need cost analysis methods that give them
information about the organization’s performance and activities in financial terms,
which is understandable and useable for its users. By having cost information in an
understandable form, managers can use this information for planning, tracking, and
controlling the aspects of the operations that they are responsible for, and the
information will also enable them to make strategic decisions effectively. (Hussey &
Ong, 2012)
Since financial and cost information are important sources of information for
managers, cost accounting methods are important aspects and a major component
within management accounting. Cost accounting methods focus on gathering and
analyzing financial data and have also evolved to become indicators for how to better
manage an organization from a strategic perspective. Also, as fund accounting is a
central aspect of governmental accounting, cost accounting plays an important role
within the public sector organizations and their internal management accounting
methods for this reason. (Hussey & Ong, 2012; Rivenback, 2005)

27

Management accounting has its focus on measuring and reporting both financial and
other types of information to the management of an organization to alleviate achieving
strategic goals. Cost accounting, however, is more focused on the information about
acquisition and consumption of resources within the organization. As this aspect is
important to understand as a manager for successful management of the organization,
cost accounting methods can provide useful information for management accounting.
(Horngren, Bhimani, Datar & Foster, 2002)
Moreover, as cost accounting is a method within management accounting, its main
task is to serve internal purposes. Therefore, the management of an organization and
the organization’s specific operations and environment shape which type of
information is necessary for decision-making. (Hussey & Ong, 2012)
As found by the previously discussed articles, organizations can use cost accounting
methods and cost management practices to succeed in the economic management of
the organization. With these components, the organizations can aim to develop their
operational effectiveness and decrease their costs.

3.3.

Cost accounting in the public service sector

Within public sector organizations, cost accounting methods are used to gather and
produce information about the operations of the organization. With the help of the cost
accounting methods, the organization can gather information about costs and spending
of tax funds within a specific public sector organization. The cost accounting methods
are also used to provide information about the costs of services or activities produced
in public sector organizations. (Raudasoja & Johansson, 2009)
A current trend within the public sector is increasing requirements regarding
transparency in operations and decision-making, especially when it comes to spending.
The public sector organizations are expected to report the costs of the services and
activities they provide. Many stakeholders are interested in this information.
Taxpayers want to know how the tax money is spent, and decision-makers need
information that will function as a foundation for decision-making. Often this

28

information is needed already before negotiations, so that the spending of scarce
resources can be evaluated well. (Raudasoja & Johansson, 2009)
Cokins (2015) also discusses the need public sector organizations have, among all
organizations, to better understand the costs of their operations, where they originate
from and how these behave. Still, there is much uncertainty about how to measure
costs in the best manner and how to interpret them. There are many different cost
measurement and accounting practices, and this can lead to doubt about which
methods are the most suitable for the specific organization. Cokins (2015) highlights
that the various methods do not automatically have to be rivals but can be used together
and simultaneously, or side by side.
Public sector organizations are often currently under pressure to cut expenses and
control spending and are, therefore, expected and required to operate as efficiently as
possible. Many government organizations have also begun to take inspiration from
private sector organizations in terms of internal accounting methods used for
management. The public sector organizations are, in other words, pressured to perform
better for less and still maintain the quality of the service. To be able to meet these
requirements the public sector organizations need to measure the actual costs of
produced services, try to improve processes, in some cases implement outsourcing
solutions, and develop a strong strategy and mission that they work towards. As the
funds for public sector organizations mainly originate from tax incomes, it is usually
not an option to acquire new resources and funds from higher tax rates, as this can be
a disliked agenda that does not receive much support. Therefore, it is of great
importance that the public sector organizations understand their costs well, so that they
can steer the organizations towards efficiency and improved performance. (Cokins,
2015)
Rivenbark (2005) discusses the history of cost accounting in public sector
organizations, and how the need for unified accounting methods was identified early
on, as municipal public sector organizations needed the ability to measure the costs of
service delivery in a more systematic manner. Thus, already early on, the interest in
tracking efficiency and exercising internal control of costs, as well as comparing
numbers with external actors, were drivers behind the implementation and use of cost
29

accounting methods. Even though the interest in cost accounting methods sparked
early on, the interest in these methods has continuously grown in the public sector.
Various initiatives motivate the usage of cost accounting methods to enable different
performance measurement systems that often require cost accounting methods to
analyze, for example, unit costs, as well as provide financial information that can be
used for comparison purposes. Rivenback (2005) also highlights that there is limited
research regarding governmental cost accounting in public sector financial literature
and, therefore, research within this area is appropriate.

3.4.

Costing methods

As mentioned previously, the purchaser-provider model creates a need for accurate
cost information that can serve as a base for decision-making regarding pricing
decisions. Distorted price levels can lead to incentives for either under- or overutilization. Therefore, it is in the interest of the purchaser of the service to make an
estimate of the actual price of a service, which is supplied by the service provider, that
is based on the accurate costs of the service delivery. (Barber, Lorenzoni & Ong, 2019)
There are various methods that can be used for costing purposes and, in the following
section, various costing methods are presented that can be used for cost accounting.
Within healthcare and hospital settings, different costing methods and techniques used
for pricing have been studied, for example, by Carroll and Lord (2016).
3.4.1. Traditional cost accounting

Traditional costing is a costing method that assigns overhead costs in an organization
to a certain output based upon a set or pre-determined cost driver. Alternatively, this
method uses a pre-established percentage for the assignment of the overhead cost. This
traditional cost accounting method is easy to use and understand and, therefore, does
not require large investments, either financially or managerially. This is most likely
the reason behind the widespread use of traditional costing methods and their
popularity. This traditional method has received critique for not providing accurate or
realistic information regarding the true costs of products or services. This can be due

30

to failure to account for variances in service or product lines and channels of
marketing. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
3.4.2. Activity-based costing

Activity-based costing was developed in the 1980s by Kaplan, and this method has
thereafter received much attention both within research and practical adoption (Carroll
& Lord, 2016).
Activity-based cost accounting is used both in private and public sector organizations,
and both manufacturing and service organizations. This method can also be beneficial
in planning phases, as it can present the relation of resource intensity and goal
achievement. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
This method has a rational approach for the costing of produced services or products.
Activity-based costing starts with the attempt to identify the primary activities and
resources that are used for producing an output. After this, the indirect costs are
assigned to the correct activities with the use of cost drivers that reflect the usage of
each specific resource pool. In contrast to traditional costing methods, activity-based
accounting methods have been praised for providing rational and accurate information
for financial management purposes. With the help of this information, managers can
make well-informed and accurate decisions regarding price calculations and different
profitability analyses. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
The fundamental belief within activity-based costing methods is that all organizational
activities are in place to support the production of either services or products and,
therefore, indirect costs can also be assigned to specific services and products.
Furthermore, this enables managers to obtain a more accurate picture of the true costs
of produced services or products. By being able to gather accurate information about
the costs of products and services, the management of an organization can place most
of their attention on value-adding activities and, therefore, the use of this method can
lead to overall better performance and satisfaction. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)

31

Cokins (2015) suggests that activity-based cost management can provide functioning
calculation methods for public sector organizations, which provide valuable
information about their costs. The activity-based cost management method seeks to
answer the primary questions regarding the incurrence of costs and the accurate price
of actions. A problem that many public sector organizations encounter is that a
spending budget needs to be determined and set for specific time periods in advance.
However, these budgets are often created without enough fundamental facts
supporting the decision-making process, which undermines the purpose of this
procedure. As the budget negotiation processes often becomes either a possibility to
increase or decrease the resources from the current level from the budget requester’s
point of view, the entire budget process can be based on unfavorable motives. The
budget process should be based on the actual resource spending level, and therefore,
be equal with the level of work that is required. (Cokins, 2015)
Moreover, Evans and Bellamy (1995) have found that activity-based costing can be
beneficial for public sector service organizations, as this method can help with
identifying cost drivers and, therefore, make management more aware of these. In
addition, this method can help with recognizing the revenues that various activities
generate and the resources the activities consume. Despite the challenges service
industries often encounter when it comes to cost control and performance assessment,
Evans and Bellamy (1995) also highlight that especially public sector service
organizations are expected to monitor the efficiency of their service provision
increasingly.
Webster and Hoque (2005) have investigated the use of cost accounting systems and
information in a public sector hospital. The authors discuss the need for cost
accounting information in modern health administration, as public sector organizations
often nowadays must compete for resources, creating a need to manage costs and
outputs well. Furthermore, the information is important for strategic management of
the organization.
Additionally, Evans and Bellamy (1995) discuss the challenges service industries and
organizations encounter regarding performance assessment and cost control. As
accounting systems designed for control often originate from the manufacturing
32

environment, and are designed for manufacturing organizations, these methods can be
difficult to adapt in service organizations, which are characterized by diversity and
complexity. Therefore, controlling costs and profitability can be more challenging
within service industries.
The activity-based costing method has received some criticism as well. An example of
this criticism is that this method can be resource-intensive to use and implement in
complex organizations, as the identification of specific cost drivers needs notable
investment both financially and managerially. Furthermore, as the environment in
which organizations operate is ever changing, maintaining this type of a costing system
can be investment- and labor-intensive, as these systems require that the cost driver
assumptions are revised regularly. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
Based on the articles discussed above it can be concluded that activity-based costing
methods can be functioning in service organizations as well, since these methods can
help the organizations recognize and identify cost drivers.
3.4.3. Time-driven activity-based costing

Time-driven activity-based costing is a management accounting method created to
tackle some of the issues identified with traditional activity-based costing. Timedriven activity-based costing methods differentiate from traditional activity-based
costing methods in the manner that time is the central and primal cost driver being
used. This method assumes that most resources, such as personnel, machinery, and
facilities, have dimensions that can be calculated in terms of time. Therefore, this
method does not require identified activities in the same manner as activity-based
costing requires. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
This method can be simpler to implement than activity-based costing methods and is
also often easier to maintain. This aspect of being more straightforward to use can be
seen as both the strength and weakness of time-driven activity-based costing. The
aspects that make this method easier to use can also weaken its usefulness in
comparison to activity-based costing, as the activities related to the indirect costs might
go unidentified when using time-driven activity-based costing methods. Hence,

33

activity-based costing can be a more useful method, as it can help with the detection
of inefficient processes. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
Further, Keel, Savage, Rafiq and Mazzocato (2017) have reviewed the use of activitybased costing within healthcare, and more specifically the use of time-driven activitybased costing methods within this field. In their paper the authors (Keel, Savage, Rafiq
& Mazzocato, 2017) discuss the aspect of cost calculations, and how this aspect has
received less focus in the field, and, therefore, proper standards for cost calculations
have not been developed. Without proper standards and models on how to calculate
the costs for health care services, valid comparisons from a value-based perspective
cannot either be made. If the cost calculation issue is solved, and the costs of the care
and services is understood, the costs for the delivery of care can be better controlled.
The study by Keel, Savage, Rafiq and Mazzocato (2017) examines how time-driven
activity-based costing can be utilized within healthcare to combat the cost challenges
the field is facing.
Traditional activity-based costing and other process-based cost accounting methods
have been implemented within the healthcare field previously, but not without a
challenge. The implementation of these methods has often proved to be resourceintensive in larger organizations, which has led to these methods not being
implemented fully in all organizations. Healthcare organizations are commonly
complex organizations, which can cause difficulties when trying to implement these
methods. Despite this, activity-based costing has been proved to be a useful method
within healthcare as well, in comparison to traditional cost-accounting methods. (Keel,
Savage, Rafiq & Mazzocato, 2017)
Moreover, time-driven activity-based costing is less resource requiring than traditional
activity-based costing, as it has a focus on accuracy instead of precision. In time-driven
activity-based costing, the focus is on the capacity cost rate and the time the service
provision needs. Therefore, this method is less resource requiring, and has been found
to be more suitable for complex organizations, such as organizations within healthcare.
(Keel, Savage, Rafiq & Mazzocato, 2017)

34

Keel, Savage, Rafiq and Mazzocato (2017) found in their paper that time-driven
activity-based costing is a useful and suitable method to use within the field of
healthcare, to make costing processes more effective, and overcome challenges that
are associated with traditional cost accounting methods. In their study, the authors
(Keel, Savage, Rafiq & Mazzocato, 2017) found that healthcare organizations viewed
the method of allocating costs by the cost capacity rate as a simpler method, than using
the activity-based costing method. The time-driven activity-based costing method also
led to more exact cost estimations. Therefore, the time-driven activity-based costing
method can be viewed as a more suitable method for healthcare organizations, and can
be worth incorporating into current systems, for better cost control and value creation.
In addition, Hoozée and Hansen (2018) have investigated the relation between timedriven activity-based costing and traditional activity-based costing. In their study,
Hoozée and Hansen (2018) found that time-driven activity-based costing methods are
more precise than activity-based costing methods in situations where the traceability
of resources to activities is at a high level, and the traceability to products is at a low
level. On the contrary, activity-based costing is more precise when activities are better
traced to products. Another conclusion that the authors (Hoozée & Hansen, 2018)
introduced was that adding activity-based costing methods into a time-driven activitybased costing model can lead to better precision, and that overall, activity-based
costing methods can be seen as more robust systems than time-driven activity-based
costing methods. Moreover, depending on the types of tasks and groups working in an
organization, either activity-based costing or time-driven activity-based costing can be
more suitable for a certain group, depending on how differentiated the tasks that the
groups work on are. Also, depending on whether one person works on tasks from
various processes or not, this can affect which method would be suitable to use.
Based on these studies, it can be concluded that time-driven activity-based costing can
be a suitable cost allocation method in certain environments and organizations. An
example is, in complex organizations operating in the field of healthcare, where the
organizations are mainly providing services and the organizations’ operations are of a
complex nature.

35

3.4.4. Performance-Focused Activity Based Costing

The performance-focused method of activity-based costing aims to tackle the abovementioned issues related to activity-based costing and time-driven activity-based
costing. This method aims to function as a performance analysis tool as well, in
addition to being a costing system. With this method, the resource consumption of the
activities is identified, as in activity-based costing, and this method is therefore an
intense costing method with many steps. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
In traditional activity-based costing, the cost drivers are identified through certain
activities, and in time-driven activity-based costing the cost driver is time, but in
performance-focused activity-based costing the actual resources required for an
activity can be analyzed in several methods, for example, with the help of interviews,
questionnaires, or according to the actual usage of resources, such as materials or time.
(Carroll & Lord, 2016)
This method also measures the cost drivers’ standard rate and variations in price, and
by doing this, the method can be useful for identifying actual cost drivers. Thus,
performance-focused activity-based costing is a greater analysis tool, and, therefore,
is a more valuable tool for planning, performance measurement and tracking
effectiveness. However, this makes the method more difficult to implement, as it
requires many steps, and various aspects of the operations must be considered
according to the model. (Carroll & Lord, 2016)
3.4.5. Ratio of cost to charges

The ratio of cost to charges-method is a cost accounting method that is specifically
used within the sector of healthcare. In this method, traditional costing methods are
first used to assign overhead costs, to enable hospitals to measure and estimate the
total costs for all the departments producing revenues. Thereafter, these estimates are
combined with data on the total charges for the total services produced by a specific
clinical department, and in this way the department-level ratio of cost to charges can
be calculated. Within the hospital sector, this method is simple to use, but this method

36

can also possibly lead to inaccurate service cost calculations and estimations. (Carroll
& Lord, 2016)
3.4.6. Cost-based pricing in the public service sector

Within healthcare, different cost accounting methods have been used internationally
to price the services that are produced and provided by the healthcare industry. The
accurate cost information of public sector hospitals is necessary for the pricing of
public healthcare services. It is important to be able to estimate accurate costs of
healthcare services, so that the cost information can function as a base for decisionmaking. This can help prevent possible negative effects that poor decision-making can
have on the quality of healthcare. In Finland, cost-based pricing is widely used in
hospital districts and is usually based on activity-based funding models. As funding
based on contracts and the purchaser-provider split model needs accurate cost data to
work efficiently, the need for accurate cost data is great within public sector healthcare.
(Raulinajtys-Grzybek, 2014)
Furthermore, for pricing based on cost information to work, the cost data must be
calculated using similar methods amongst all the providers. Detailed knowledge
regarding the cost structure and the cost drivers within public sector services enables
focused policy making and better use of public resources. Accurate cost information
also makes it possible to choose the most efficient provider. Additionally, accurate
cost information is needed to be able to plan the service structure realistically and
estimate the resources this structure requires. Further, with the help of substantial cost
data, the cost control of the organization will be improved. (Raulinajtys-Grzybek,
2014)
As the services provided by healthcare organizations are similar in their nature to the
services provided by the rescue services, and the funding decisions are made in a
similar manner, cost accounting methods that have been proven to be functioning
within healthcare organizations could work within the rescue service organizations as
well. Therefore, the implementation of these methods should be considered and
analyzed within the field of rescue services as well.

37

3.5.

Management accounting and strategic decision-making

In today’s ever changing business environment, management accounting information
is expected to serve the purpose of evaluating and following up strategic performance,
in addition to helping managers with making sensible decisions, despite constant
organizational and environmental changes. This means that the operational aspects and
issues are still important within management accounting, but also the incorporation of
strategic concerns has increased. (Horngren, Bhimani, Datar & Foster, 2002).
In public sector organizations it is important to consider the economic aspects in
relation to the organizations’ legal requirements and the goals set for these activities.
Even though these organizations are not profit-seeking in their nature, and the legal
requirements for these organizations function as the foundation for all their operations,
it is important that the management of these organizations also considers the economic
aspects of their operations and how the organizations can develop their economic
performance. With the help of strategic goals organizations can ensure that they are
headed in the right direction and remain successful in the future as well. A part of
realistic strategy work is the incorporation and consideration of economic and financial
aspects of the operations. (Raudasoja & Johansson, 2009)

3.6.

Discussion on literature review

The theory and research articles discussed above affirm that operations and costs are
closely related concepts that affect each other. To improve efficiency, quality, and
service provision, a fundamental aspect is to have proper cost information about the
operations, which can function as a base for decision-making.
As the relationship between the municipality and the local rescue service department
is organized in accordance with the purchaser-provider model, accurate cost
information is of great importance for decision-making purposes and when defining
the Standard Service Decision, which defines the framework for the operations of the
rescue services. To work efficiently, the purchaser-provider split model requires

38

accurate cost data. This cost data can then be used to estimate a correct price for the
purchased services.
Especially, within public sector service organizations, cost information serves an
important function, as transparency about spending and costs is expected from these
organizations in an increasing manner. The spending of public means is also expected
to be cost-efficient, and the public sector organizations are often expected to provide
service of the same quality as before or even improved quality, but for less resources.
This also creates a need for accurate cost data, which can be used for identifying
possible challenges in the operations and help to manage the operations as costefficiently as possible. With the use of, for example, activity-based costing systems,
the cost information retrieved with the help of this method can be utilized to be able to
focus on value-adding activities in the operations.
Moreover, as New Public Management has influenced the administration of public
sector organizations and reforms regarding public administration, it is crucial to have
proper management accounting methods in place, to ensure that the quality of public
sector services does not deteriorate. Furthermore, there has been criticism towards
New Public Management inspired methods and public sector organizations taking
inspiration from administration models retrieved from the private sector. The criticism
has been concerned with the changes inspired by the New Public Management
approach having a negative effect on the quality of public services. Therefore, it is
necessary to have sufficient information about the public sector organizations’
operations, to ensure that the quality of public services remains on the desired level.
In addition, this is important from the health and social services reform perspective, as
good quality public service also is a strategic goal of the reform.

39

4. Methodology and data
The methods used in this thesis will be a case study analyzing the financial information
and accounting information of the regional rescue services in Finland, as well as
gathering data through a questionnaire from the regional rescue services. These
methods will be used to gain an understanding of how the public sector in Finland,
with special focus on the field of rescue services, can utilize accounting and cost
information to strategically manage the rescue services, also through the health and
social services reform, and ensure good and strategic management after the reform has
been implemented in the year 2023.
The problem for the rescue services in Finland, and the municipalities that govern and
“own” these departments and purchase the rescue services through the purchaserprovider model, is how to combine the operations and the pricing of the services. As
the municipality purchases the rescue services for a set price from the rescue service
departments, the challenge is how to define and how to estimate the accurate price of
the services. Therefore, information regarding the price of the services is essential for
the decision-making process.

4.1.

Research methodology

In the following sections, the method of this study will be explained, and the data being
used will be clarified. The chosen research methods and data collected for this thesis
aims to find answers to the research questions that are defined for this thesis.
4.1.1. Case study method

David (2006) discusses the different dimensions of case studies as a research method.
By using case studies as a research method, both qualitative and quantitative data can
be included in the research data. Case studies as a research method is used as a strategy
to understand complex issues by use of various data collection techniques. (David,
2006)

40

David (2006) cites Yin (2004) regarding case studies:
“[C]ase studies investigate real-life events in their natural settings. The goal is
to practice sound research while capturing both a phenomenon (the real life
event) and its context (the natural setting). One strength of the case study
method is its usefulness when phenomenon and context are not readily
separable… Another strength is that the method enables you, as a social
scientist, to address how and why questions about the real-life events, using a
broad variety of empirical tools.” (David, 2006, What is a Case Study?)
Through qualitative case studies, the researcher can study complex phenomena in
depth within a specific context. This method can be used within various fields of
business and is also a functioning method for business research. This method is used
to study a phenomenon in a specific context, with the help of various sources of data
and from various angles, to understand the issue and its complexity. The phenomenon
is also studied in its natural environment, to obtain realistic results. (Rashid, Rashid,
Warraich, Sabir & Waseem, 2019)
The aim of this thesis is to gain an understanding of the current economic state of the
rescue services departments in Finland, as well as analyzing their current cost
accounting methods used for pricing. Therefore, the case study method is a technique
that can permit the exploration of this issue in an in-depth manner, to gain a thorough
understanding of the issue, with the use of multiple data sources analyzed in their own
context.
Next the specific research methods used for the execution of the case study will be
discussed more profoundly, and their suitability for this thesis will be reviewed.
4.1.2. Financial statement and document analysis

To answer the research agenda set for this thesis a case study method will be applied
to conduct a thorough analysis of the financial situation of the rescue services in
Finland, and review and analyze the information used for the decision-making process.
As the municipalities should utilize all available data regarding the operations of the

41

rescue services for the negotiation process of the Service Standard Decision, the
information used for this process will be analyzed in this study, to understand the base
on which the contract and decision-making is made. Financial reports used for the
negotiation process of the Service Standard Decision can be for example financial
statements of the rescue services, quarterly reports, operational and financial
monitoring reports, and previous contracts of the Service Standard Decision.
These reports and documents will be analyzed to gain knowledge about the current
state of the rescue services, the information that can be drawn from the reports, and
whether this information serves its purpose.
The financial statements of companies are major sources of information about the
company and its financial performance and development. When doing a financial
analysis of a company, the financial statements of the company are analyzed to
understand, among other things, the performance, funding, and prerequisites for the
company’s operations. (Niskanen & Niskanen, 2003)
As financial and economic information about an organization’s operations and
performance is valuable knowledge for decision-making, as found by Cepêda &
Monteiro (2020), this type of a research method is suitable for the purpose of this
thesis. Bowen (2009) states that document analysis often is a suitable research method
for case studies that use a qualitative approach, as the analysis of documents can enable
the researcher to find insights, understanding and meaning related to the research
question and problem in the study. Bowen (2009) also highlights that documents, such
as financial statements and reports, are stable sources of data, as they are non-reactive
and are not altered because of the study or the presence of the researcher, as well as
being exact forms of data with clear references and details, for example.
One potential limitation of document analysis, in this thesis analysis of financial
statements, can be insufficient detail for the study, as the data and documents are not
made for this purpose in the first place. Therefore, they can be lacking for the research
question and problem that is being studied. In this thesis this possible limitation should
not cause issues for the data needed for the analysis, as financial statements provide a
broad spectrum of data about the financial situation of the rescue services, and
42

additional data will be gathered through a supplementary questionnaire, to gain access
to all the knowledge about the financial situation that is necessary for this thesis.
(Bowen, 2009)
For this thesis the financial statements of the 22 regional rescue services of the fiscal
year 2019 will be analyzed through a document and financial analysis. The financial
statements will be analyzed to gain information over the overall financial reporting of
the rescue service departments. The financial information and reporting methods of
the regional rescue service departments will be analyzed and compared to understand
whether the data is comparable between the departments and how this information
supports decision-making.
The financial statements of 2019 for the regional rescue services will be received from
the Ministry of the Interior for the study in this thesis. Operational and statistical data
will also be received and gathered through the statistical database Pronto.
The research method used in this thesis will be a qualitative study, conducted as a case
study of the rescue services in Finland, where the financial statements and financial
data will be analyzed through a financial analysis, and further explanations about the
financial statements and the financial information found in these will be received and
collected through a questionnaire that will be sent out to the regional rescue services
by the Ministry of the Interior for this thesis and study.
The findings in this thesis will also be compared to the findings in the previous study
by Määttälä (2013) to synthesize the results, and to be able to construct an even deeper
meaning, as explained by for example Erwin, Brotherson and Summers (2011).
Erwin, Brotherson and Summers (2011) explain that a qualitative meta-synthesis is a
research method where results from different qualitative studies can be analyzed across
the different studies and compared to draw conclusions by combining the qualitative
evidence. This method is used to gain deeper insight into the research question by the
synthesis of previous qualitative studies.

43

4.1.3. Questionnaire

In addition to the financial analysis a qualitative questionnaire will be sent out to the
regional rescue services. The questionnaire will be used to gather additional
information about the financial situation and reporting of the rescue service
departments, to supplement the information from the financial statements and the
database Pronto and, therefore, provide more insight into areas that need further
explanation. The questionnaire gathers additional information on the financial
information received from the reports, so that the financial information can be
interpreted more profoundly, and different posts in the financial reports can be
interpreted in more detail for the purpose of this study.
The questionnaire will be sent out to the regional rescue service departments from the
Ministry of the Interior in the beginning of the year of 2021, to receive the additional
information for the analysis of the financial statements.
The questionnaire can be found in the appendix of this thesis in Finnish and an English
translation is also attached, as the questionnaire was sent out in the Finnish language.
Bowen (2009) also highlights that document analysis can be further strengthened as a
research method by collecting support data through other methods as well, and in this
thesis the additional data will be gathered through the questionnaire.
4.1.4. Additional statistical data

Additional statistical and operational data will be received through the statistical
database Pronto, the rescue services resource and accident statistics program (Pronto),
that the local rescue services together with the Ministry of the Interior have over the
rescue services. The Emergency Services Academy Finland maintains the Pronto
database. The Pronto data was received through the Ministry of the Interior as a part
of their research project (fin. Pelastustoimen ja siviilivalmiuden suorituskyky ja
suunnitteluperusteet–hanke).

44

The statistical and operational data in combination with the financial statement data,
that is supported by the additional information on the financial situation gathered from
the local rescue services through the questionnaire, will be used for analysis in this
study.
4.1.5. Sample

In this thesis, the financial statements of all the 22 regional rescue services in Finland
will be analyzed and other relevant financial and operational reports for the rescue
services in Finland. This information will be analyzed to understand the financial
situation and reporting of the whole rescue service field in Finland. All rescue service
regions and the municipalities under which they function are included in the study.
The 22 regional rescue services in Finland are the following:
-

5. Results and analysis
In this chapter, the results from the empirical analysis will be presented and discussed.
The results from the analysis will also be examined with the research questions that
were defined for this thesis.

5.1.

Financial analysis of the current economic state

In this analysis, the current economic state of the 22 regional rescue service
departments was analyzed for the year 2019. The analysis was conducted by
examining the financial statement information of the regional rescue service
departments and the financial data from the internal statistics database Pronto. The
financial information in the internal statistical database Pronto has a similar structure
as the external financial statements follow, but in Pronto, the financial data has been
divided by function. The financial statements follow the structure defined by the
Municipal Section of the Accounting Board. It operates under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Employment. The structure is defined in the general instructions
regarding the financial statements of municipalities and joint municipal authorities
(fin. Yleisohje kunnan ja kuntayhtymän tilinpäätöksen ja toimintakertomuksen
laatimisesta) (Association of Finnish Municipalities, 2020).
First, the overall costs and incomes of 2019 were analyzed and calculated. The analysis
was conducted to obtain a general view of the distributions of the costs and incomes
and see how these vary between the departments.
5.1.1. Cost analysis

In this analysis, the total costs of all the departments for the year 2019 were included.
The cost data were gathered from the financial statements of the year 2019 and the
internal statistical database Pronto. From the Pronto data, the departments' costs were
divided and appointed to the different functions of the rescue service departments. The
functions were the following: rescue operations, preventive measures, and support
activities, which compose the legally required activities. In addition, the costs for the

47

functions emergency care and first response were included, as the rescue service
departments also arrange these functions, and the data about these functions can be
found from the Pronto database. From these functions, the total costs of the rescue
service departments were calculated for the year 2019.
The departments' costs include the following items of expenditure: personnel
expenses, rent fees, procured services, materials, supplies and goods, allowances and
grants, other operational expenses, depreciations, financial expenses, and
extraordinary expenses.
In Figure 2 below, the total costs of the rescue service departments can be found (in 1
000 €).

The total costs include all the functions of the rescue service departments, including
emergency medical care and first response functions. The total costs for all the rescue
service departments were 602 101 000,00 € in 2019. The department with the highest
costs in 2019 was the Rescue Services of Helsinki, with total costs of 56 783 000,00
€. Next, the department with the second-highest costs was the Rescue Services of
Pirkanmaa with the total costs of 51 136 000,00 €. In third and fourth place were the
departments of Rescue Services of Western Uusimaa with the total costs 46 614 000,00
€ and Rescue Services of Southwest Finland with the total costs of 45 311 000,00 €.
The total costs of the departments primarily consist of the legally required tasks. On
average, 76,06 % of the total costs of the departments originate from the legally
required tasks. In Figure 3 below, the share of costs for the legally required tasks can
be found. There is quite some variation in the percentage between the departments.
The variation depends on to which extent the department produces emergency medical
care and first response services, in addition to the legally required services.

The cost change was calculated, comparing the situation in 2010 to the situation in
2019. The comparison was made to review how the costs of the rescue service
departments have developed over nine years. The cost information for the year 2010
was gathered through the internal statistical database Pronto. This analysis was
conducted to understand how the costs have evolved and how this has varied between
the departments. The inflation was considered in the calculations using the Statistic
Finland’s price index of public expenditure to calculate the year 2019 to the same value
as the costs were in the year 2010. The value of the index used was 111,9 for the year
2019.
Overall, the average growth in costs was 28,48 % considering the inflation rate using
the price index of public expenditure. The most significant percentual growth was in
the Rescue Services of Jokilaaksot, where the percentual and actual growth rate
between 2010 and 2019 was 107,70 %. All departments had a growth rate in their costs
between 2010 and 2019, except for the Rescue Services of Helsinki. The costs of this
department had decreased by 0,14 %, considering the inflation rate. The growth of
costs can, to some extent, be explained by an increased amount of emergency care
services being arranged by the rescue service departments. The departments where the
costs over the past nine years had grown the most costs for the emergency care services
had also grown significantly.
Below, the change in the total costs of the departments between the years 2010 and
2019 is presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Comparison of total costs per department in 2010 and 2019 (in 1 000 €)
Following this, the general cost structure of all the costs of the rescue service
departments was calculated. The costs were divided into the different cost types that
could be identified based on the financial data from the Pronto database and the
financial statements. These were the following:
- Salaries and fees,
- Social security expenses,
- Procured services,
- Materials, supplies, and goods,
- Allowances and grants,
- Rent fees,
- Other operating expenses, and
- Depreciations.
Based on these calculations of the costs mentioned above, the percentual portion of the
total costs was calculated to outline and visualize the cost structure. The figure on the
cost structure can be found below Figure 5.

In Figure 5, the percentual distribution and cost structure of all the rescue service
departments can be found. The relative costs presented in the above Figure 5 have been
calculated with the total costs of the department in question to acquire the relational
percentual distribution of the costs.
The cost data found in the internal statistical database Pronto consists of similar posts
included in the financial statement in the income statement. In the Pronto database, the
costs and incomes are separated and divided between the various functions and
expenditure items in the same manner as in the external financial statements.
As is presented in Figure 5 over the cost structure, the personnel costs are the most
significant expense item for all the rescue service departments. This is explained by
the rescue service departments being are service organizations. The expense
items, Salaries and fees, and Social security expenses cover over half of the rescue
services costs. More specifically, on average, 65,47 % of the total costs of all the rescue
service departments consist of personnel costs.
5.1.2. Income analysis

The income of the rescue service departments was also calculated to supplement the
cost information and compare the rescue service departments and their incomes. The
incomes in 2019 were compared to the incomes in 2010 to view how these have
evolved. Moreover, the comparison was made to be able to compare it to the evolution
of the costs. The incomes of the rescue service departments divided into the different
functions can be found in the below tables.
From the Pronto data, the incomes of the departments were divided and appointed to
the different functions of the rescue service departments. The functions were the same
as for the cost data, which were the following: rescue operations, preventive measures,
and support activities, which covers the legally required activities. In addition, the
costs for the functions emergency care and first response were included, as the rescue
service departments also arrange these functions, and data about these functions can

53

be found from the Pronto database for the incomes as well. From these functions, the
total incomes of the rescue service departments were calculated for the year 2019.
The income data can also be divided into the different functions of the rescue service
departments based on the data from the Pronto database. The financial income data
also follow a similar structure to the external financial statements. They include the
following income items: transfers to the rescue services and transfers to the emergency
medical care from the municipalities, sales proceeds, fees and charges, subsidies, and
grants, rental income, other operating revenue, financial income, and extraordinary
incomes.
In Figure 6 below, the total incomes of the rescue service departments can be found
(in 1 000 €).

Figure 6: Total incomes (in 1 000 €) of the rescue service departments
The total incomes include all the functions of the rescue service departments, including
emergency medical care and first response functions. The total incomes for all the
rescue service departments were 596 781 000,00 € in 2019. The department with the
54

highest income in 2019 was the Rescue Services of Helsinki, with a total income of 56
781 000,00 €. Moreover, the department with the second-highest income was the
Rescue Services of Pirkanmaa, with a total income of 51 128 000,00 €. In third and
fourth place were the departments of Rescue Services of Western Uusimaa with the
total income of 46 592 000,00 € and Rescue Services of Southwest Finland with the
total income of 43 382 000,00 €. As the municipalities carry the primary funding
responsibility of the rescue service departments and are the purchasers of the services,
the costs of the rescue service departments that are not covered by, for example, fees
and charges, should be covered by the funding from the municipality to cover the
expenses. Therefore, the costs and incomes of the rescue service departments are
almost even, and the incomes follow the departments' costs.
The total incomes of the departments mainly consist of the incomes from the legally
required tasks. On average, 75,73 % of the total incomes of the departments originate
from the legally required tasks. In Figure 7 below, the share of incomes from the
legally required tasks can be found. The same variation in the percentage between the
departments can be found in the incomes as well. The variation in this case also
depends on to which extent the department produces emergency medical care and first
response services, in addition to the legally required services.

Figure 7: Share of incomes from legally required tasks of total incomes
Further, to examine how the incomes of the rescue service departments have developed
between 2010 and 2019, the change in incomes was calculated. The income
information for the year 2010 was also gathered through the internal statistical
database Pronto. The analysis was conducted to complement the cost analysis and
obtain an overall understanding of how the incomes have evolved and how the incomes
have varied between the departments. The inflation was considered in the calculations
using the same index as for the costs. The value of the index used was 111,9 for the
year 2019.
In general, the average growth in incomes was 20,66 %, considering the inflation rate
using the price index of public expenditure. The most considerable percentual growth
was in the Rescue Services of Jokilaaksot, where the percentual and actual growth rate
between 2010 and 2019 was 102,27 %. Most departments had a growth rate in their
incomes between 2010 and 2019, except for three departments. The first department

56

with a decrease in incomes was the Rescue Services of South Savo. The incomes of
this department had decreased by 42,68 % when considering the inflation rate. The
second department with a negative change in incomes was the Rescue Services of
Helsinki, as the incomes of this department had decreased by 3,09 %, considering the
inflation rate. The third and final department with a negative change in incomes was
the Rescue Services of Satakunta, as the incomes of this department had decreased by
1,82 % with inflation considered.
Below, the change in the total incomes of the departments between the years 2010 and
2019 is presented in Figure 8.

Further, the structure analysis was conducted on the income data to obtain the same
overview of the income structure of the rescue service departments. The incomes were
also divided into the different income types identified in the Pronto database and
financial statements.
These were the following:
- Transfers to rescue services,
- Transfers to emergency medical care,
- Sales proceeds,
- Fees and charges,
- Subsidies and grants,
- Rent income, and
- Other operating revenue.
The overall income structure can be found in Figure 9 below.

Figure 9: Income structure of the regional rescue services

59

Figure 9 presents the income structure of the rescue service departments. For most
rescue service departments, the largest income source is the transfers to rescue services
and their operational activities from the municipalities. On average, these transfers
from the municipality to the operations were 76,61 % of the total incomes.
Based on the income structure analysis, for most of the rescue service departments, the
most significant source of income is the transfers from the municipalities for their
operations.
The transfers being the primary source of income is aligned with the municipalities
being the purchasers of these services and having the primary funding responsibility
for these purchased services. As the municipalities purchase the services that the
rescue service departments produce, the costs of the rescue service departments that
are not covered by, for example, fees and charges, should be covered by the funding
from the municipality to cover the expenses.
Another interesting finding from the cost structure and income structure figures is that
the cost structure seems to be much more consistent over the different rescue service
departments compared to the income structure, which has more variation between the
departments. The changes and variations in these incomes could be, for example, based
on how the emergency care services are arranged in the area of the rescue service
department and whether the department receives funding for this task.

5.2.

Results from the questionnaire

A questionnaire was sent out to all the 22 regional rescue service departments to gather
additional information on the departments’ financial information and financial
reporting practices. The framework for the questionnaire can be found in the
appendices. Answers to the sent questionnaire were received from all the 22 rescue
services from their financial department. The questionnaire focused on gathering
additional financial data from the rescue service departments to gain a more profound
insight into the costs and incomes of the departments and understand what these posts

60

consist of in more detail. In the following sections, the results from the questionnaire
will be presented.
The first question was regarding oil and chemical spill prevention and response
measures that the rescue service departments carry out. Most rescue service
departments could answer the exact costs and incomes for this activity. A few
departments could not determine the specific costs for these functions separately. The
Rescue Services of East Uusimaa, Rescue Services of Pirkanmaa, Rescue Services of
Satakunta, Rescue Services of Kymenlaakso, and Rescue Services of South Savo could
not determine the costs for the preventive measures separately. The Rescue Services
of Satakunta responded that working hours are not tracked for this function and,
therefore, costs cannot be fully determined for this function. The Rescue Services of
Kainuu could determine the costs for this function but not the incomes. The Rescue
Services of Central Ostrobothnia could determine the costs, but the department was
unsure how the expenses are accounted for in the internal database Pronto. The Rescue
Services of North Karjala responded that the costs are accounted for in overhead costs.
Therefore, the department is not able to determine the costs separately for this function.
Most variation between the departments was mainly found in the supporting activities
considered in the second question. The second question was divided into the various
supporting activities that the departments utilize. These were the following: IT
administration services, financial administration services, maintenance and technical
services, cleaning services, personnel administration, and legal services.
The different functions were produced in various manners between the departments.
None of the departments produce all their supporting activities themselves. They all
have services that are also purchased, either from the municipality or from external
providers. The services purchased from external providers were billed in full according
to contracts from all the departments. An exception was the services that the
departments receive through the owner municipality and the municipality enterprise
group.
In total, 15 departments responded that they receive supporting activities from the
municipality, which are not billed for in total. Two departments responded that all
61

services received through the municipality are billed in general overhead costs, and
therefore, costs for specific functions cannot be determined separately. These two
departments were the Rescue Services of Central Uusimaa and the Rescue Services of
East Uusimaa. A few departments responded that they do not receive any services
through the municipality which would not be billed. These were the Rescue Services
of Päijät-Häme, the Rescue-Services of Lappland, the Rescue Services of South Savo,
and the Rescue Services of Central Uusimaa.
There were also differences in the rent payments and of what these costs consist.
Especially when it comes to dividing the rent costs between the rescue services and
emergency medical care, there were various methods of doing this. In some cases, only
the properties that were used fully by the emergency medical care services were
assigned to this function, and in other cases, these costs were assigned in line with the
used square footage. Other factors that variated were whether, for example, repair
services were included in the rent of the properties.
Otherwise, the costs for the emergency care services were determined and accounted
for specifically in all departments. This can be explained by these services being
arranged together with the hospital district. Therefore, cost tracking is more advanced
and developed for this function.
Based on the answers and additional information from the questionnaire, there are
implications that the practices vary between the departments on how costs are formed
and whether all the actual costs of the departments are displayed in the reported costs.
Factors affecting this were whether the rescue service department received many
supporting activities through the municipality. Depending on whether the price of
these services is billed fully or at all, hidden costs can emerge. Variations were also
identified in which services the rescue service departments receive from the
municipality and which services they produce themselves or purchase from external
providers. Therefore, the cost data and what the data includes can fluctuate between
the departments.
Since some of the services are not billed fully or at all, the likelihood of hidden costs
is higher. The hidden costs are problematic as the presence of these possible hidden
62

costs also varies between the departments. Another concern appears if the services
received from the municipality are billed all together in general overhead costs and not
appointed to the various functions. Because of this, these costs cannot be reported to
the actual functions utilizing these services.
Overall, the main issue with the varying reporting methods that the rescue service
departments use is that this can lead to hidden costs within the municipality enterprise
group that are not present in the reported costs of the departments. Moreover, as there
are variations between the departments where these hidden costs might occur, the
financial information between the departments is less comparable. This also means
that there are differences in how accurate the cost data of the departments are, as the
data of some departments include a higher level of hidden costs.

5.3.

Discussion on findings

Based on the data and analysis above, the current economic state of the rescue service
departments was first determined to obtain an overall view of the rescue service
departments' situation and understand how their situations vary in comparison to each
other. This analysis was conducted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of all the
rescue service departments.
The financial analysis answered the first part of the first research question set for this
thesis: What is the current economic state of the Finnish rescue service and the local
rescue service departments regarding their financial reporting methods? The analysis
was continued with the data gathered from the questionnaire to answer the second part
of this research question and acquire a more comprehensive answer.
The analysis continued with analyzing the state of the rescue service departments'
more detailed financial information and reporting practices through the questionnaire
answers to see how the practices of the rescue service departments differ and identify
possible weaknesses in the methods used currently.

63

Based on the additional financial information received in the answers to the
questionnaire, the more detailed cost information of the rescue service departments
was analyzed to identify differences between practices. In this analysis, it was found
that there are various practices regarding how the costs are reported. It also became
clear that as there are differences in mostly the supporting activities that the rescue
service departments purchase from either the municipality or external providers, as
there are variations in whether these services are billed fully, partially, or at all.
Consequently, hidden costs emerge when the price of some services might not be billed
in total and as there are variations in the practices between the departments. The
different practices also lead to the issue that the financial information of the rescue
service departments is not comparable, as there can occur variations in which costs are
included and to what degree, for example. Raulinajtys-Grzybek (2014) points out that
for pricing based on cost information to work, the cost data needs to be calculated
using similar methods amongst all the providers. Detailed knowledge regarding the
cost structure and the cost drivers within public sector services enables more focused
policymaking and better use of spending public resources. These findings also support
the need for developed costing methods.
The second research question was: Is the financial and economic information received
from the local rescue services serving its purpose to function as a base for decisionmaking and management in the municipalities who are the purchasers of the rescue
services? As the results from the analysis identified, there are hidden costs that might
occur, especially in the supporting activities and those received through the
municipality. The possible hidden costs lead to a situation where the cost data of the
rescue service departments might not always include all the actual costs of the services.
Therefore, the accurate costs of all the different functions cannot be determined as
precisely.
The last research question was: How can the Finnish public sector rescue services
develop

their

financial

information

to

support

decision-making

more

thoroughly? Based on the analysis conducted in this thesis, the need for more precise
and unified costing methods was identified. Developed costing methods would lead to
more accurate cost data that would ensure that the correct costs of the services are
known and that pricing decisions can be made based on the accurate costs. This would
64

also improve the comparability of the departments' costs, which is an essential factor
if the health and social services reform is implemented and the executive power of the
state strengthened. As found in the analysis of the current economic state and cost
structure of the rescue services, the most significant expense item is personnel costs
on average for all the rescue service departments. Therefore, the rescue service
departments could benefit from having more precise time-tracking systems in place.
The departments and municipalities would receive more precise information on the
departments' services' costs, and from which activities these originate. Also, timedriven activity-based costing methods can be beneficial in these types of organizations,
found by Keel, Savage, Rafiq, and Mazzocato (2017) as well as Carroll and Lord
(2016). The time-driven activity-based costing method can be easier to implement than
activity-based costing methods. This method is also often more manageable to
maintain within organizations. This aspect of being simpler to use can be seen as both
the strength and weakness of the time-driven activity-based costing method (Carroll
& Lord, 2016).
Cokins (2015) also proposes that activity-based costing methods can provide
functioning calculation methods for public sector organizations, as these methods
provide valuable information about the organization’s costs. The activity-based cost
management method seeks to answer the fundamental questions regarding the
incurrence of costs and the accurate price of actions. Many public sector organizations
encounter the problem that a spending budget needs to be determined and set for
specific periods in advance. Nevertheless, these budgets are often created without
enough fundamental facts supporting the decision-making process, which undermines
the purpose of this procedure. Moreover, the entire budget process can be based on
unfavorable motives. The budget process should be based on the actual resource
spending level and, consequently, be equal to the required level of work. (Cokins,
2015)
The issue mentioned above is present within the Finnish rescue services, as found in
the analysis. As the cost data of the departments do not necessarily contain all the
actual costs, this can undermine the negotiation process of the Service Standard
Decision.

65

The activity-based costing method has received criticism as well. This method can be
resource-intensive to use and implement in complex organizations. Identifying
specific cost drivers needs notable investment both financially and managerially.
Moreover, as the environment in which organizations operate is ever-changing,
maintaining these types of costing systems can be investment- and labor-intensive, as
these systems require that the cost driver assumptions are revised regularly (Carroll &
Lord, 2016). As the Finnish rescue services also are complex organizations, the
development of the costing systems will require significant efforts to create
functioning systems. Nevertheless, to ensure that the decision-making is based on
accurate information, it is necessary to have functioning and suitable costing methods.
Hoozée and Hansen (2018) propose adding activity-based costing methods into timedriven activity-based costing models, as this can lead to better precision. Overall,
activity-based costing methods can be seen as more robust systems than time-driven
activity-based costing methods. Consequently, the combination of these two could be
beneficial for the organization. Hence, the Finnish rescue service could benefit from
utilizing aspects from both methods to create a functioning costing method suitable for
their needs and departments.
Moreover, the internal database with financial information corresponds to the external
requirements for financial reporting to a large extent. As the structure for the external
reporting might not be ideal for internal usage, the rescue service departments could
benefit from developing the internally used information to support decision-making
better.
Based on the answers to the research questions mentioned above, it can be concluded
that the Finnish rescue services could benefit from developing their cost accounting
methods to acquire more accurate cost data for decision-making. This thesis found that
there are weaknesses in the reporting methods and cost data of the rescue service
departments through the research questions.
As a result of varying practices between the departments, the data of the departments
are not fully comparable. Moreover, the data does not always include all the actual
costs of the produced services. As some departments receive several services free of
66

charge from the municipality, the cost data of the departments do not necessarily
portray the actual total costs of the produced services.
This issue is especially relevant with regards to the health and social services reform.
The responsibility for organizing the rescue services will be transferred from the
municipality to the new welfare counties through the reform. Therefore, accurate total
costs for producing the rescue services must be known and considered in the decisionmaking regarding the reform. Otherwise, a situation can occur where the responsibility
is transferred to the new welfare counties, and the actual costs for producing the
services are higher than expected, as some of the services are received free of charge
from the municipality previously. Therefore, the cost data of the departments do not
always portray all the costs of the departments. Thus, the cost data does not accurately
represent what it costs to produce the services in total, which is vital for the decisionmaking, as stated by, for example, Bettner (2015) and Hussey and Ong (2012).
This same issue is essential when considering other public sector reforms as well. The
costs of public sector organizations must be accurately determined so that decisionmaking can be done based on valid information (Bettner, 2015; Hussey & Ong, 2012).
Otherwise, the decisions can be based on false assumptions, which can lead to
undesirable outcomes. As Pellinen (2003) highlights, accounting information is vital
in the decision-making process. Especially during periods when the management of an
organization is deciding on the organization's future from economic aspects and
intending to lead the organization properly from a financial perspective, accurate
accounting information plays a vital role.
Furthermore, the analysis of the cost development from 2010 to 2019 revealed a 28,48
% growth in the departments' costs on average. Public sector organizations are
presently under pressure to cut expenses and provide services for less (Silvestre,
Marques, Dollery, & Correia, 2019). Many reforms, such as the health and social
services reform, aim to produce public services cost-effectively (STM055:00/2019).
Cost awareness is crucial to accomplish this agenda. As the analysis in this thesis
found, the current cost information of the rescue service departments does not
necessarily contain all the actual costs of the produced services. Hence, the data used
for decision-making does not fully serve its purpose. Moreover, it raises the question
67

of whether management accounting methods are utilized to a sufficient degree within
the public sector and its administration, as the costs are rising despite constant pressure
to produce services more cost-efficiently.
Furthermore, as the health and social services reform will transfer the primary funding
responsibility from the municipalities to the state (STM055:00/2019), the need for
comparable cost data between the rescue service departments is increased. Currently,
the cost data of the departments do not necessarily portray all the total costs of the
departments fairly, which means that the data cannot be compared between the
departments.
Therefore, based on the findings from this thesis, both public sector organizations and
administrators would profit from more developed managerial accounting methods
within the public sector. With more advanced cost accounting methods in place,
administrators could ensure that decision-making is based on valid information.
Moreover, this would ensure that public sector reforms achieve their intended agenda,
as all crucial aspects are considered in the decision-making process. This is coherent
with the literature review findings, for example, with the findings of Bettner (2015)
and Hussey and Ong (2012).
Consequently, the findings from this thesis have contributed to the research field by
providing insight into the matter that more advanced managerial accounting methods
within the public sector would serve both public sector organizations and
administrators in decision-making. Moreover, the analysis has identified issues within
the current practices of Finnish rescue services and how these issues might be present
in other public sector organizations as well and affect public sector reforms.

68

6. Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to research how public sector service organizations
implementing the purchaser-provider model can develop their cost accounting
methods to support decision-making. This was studied in a case study of the Finnish
rescue services, which are governed by the owner municipality per the purchaserprovider model. The study was conducted to understand the situation of their financial
reporting and costing methods and see how these could be developed to serve the
information need of the purchaser-provider model better.
The analysis identified weaknesses in the reporting and costing methods used by the
rescue service departments to report costs, as all costs are not necessarily included in
the reported costs. The departments and owner municipalities could benefit from
developing their costing methods further, which is supported by the findings of Carroll
and Lord (2016) and Cokins (2015). Moreover, as the services produced by the rescue
service departments are personnel-oriented, time-driven activity-based costing
methods could be beneficial for the rescue service departments, supported by findings
of Keel, Savage, Rafiq, and Mazzocato (2017) and Carroll and Lord (2016).
The study also found that there are variations in the reporting methods of the rescue
service departments. The expense items of the departments do not necessarily include
the actual costs of all received services, as the owner municipality does not always
charge the department fully for these. Therefore, there can be hidden costs that are not
always present in the cost data of the municipal enterprise group. Raulinajtys-Grzybek
(2014) emphasizes the need for accurate cost data in the public sector. As for pricing
based on cost information to work, the cost data must be calculated using comparable
methods amongst all the providers. The author (Raulinajtys-Grzybek, 2014) also
highlights that more precise knowledge regarding the cost structure and the cost drivers
within public sector services enables more focused policy making and better use of
public resources. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop standardized reporting
methods for the financial information to be comparable.

The analysis in this thesis identified issues in the Finnish rescue service departments
regarding the costing methods, as they are utilizing the purchaser-provider model for
governance. The study identified what issues are present and what further issues the
current methods may cause. By analyzing the Finnish rescue services situation, this
thesis aimed to understand how public sector service organizations utilizing the
purchaser-provider model can develop their costing methods to meet the needs of the
model better. The analysis in this thesis also found how managerial accounting
methods and cost accounting methods can serve public sector organizations and
administrators. Especially when it comes to public sector reforms, functioning cost
accounting methods are essential for ensuring that information used for decisionmaking accurately represents the organization's situation.

6.1.

Limitations of this study and suggestions for further research

As this study focused on studying the whole field of rescue services in Finland, the
studied area was quite comprehensive. Therefore, this thesis could not examine the
situation of a specific department more thoroughly to gain a more in-depth
understanding of the situation of one department. Because of this, it would be
interesting also to examine the situation of one department more thoroughly. This
could be studied by focusing on the decision-making process between the department
and owner municipality in more depth, such as observations or interviews. By
narrowing down the research area, the study objective can be examined more in-depth.
By examining the situation of one department more closely, the degree of the issues
found in this thesis could be studied more profoundly and thus understood more
thoroughly. Moreover, by understanding the situation of one department more deeply,
it could thoroughly be studied how their cost accounting methods could be developed
in the most suitable manner.

Swedish summary – Svensk sammanfattning
Kostnadsberäkningsmetoder för att stöda offentliga tjänstebolag – Fallstudie av det
finländska räddningsväsendet
Beställar-utförar-modellen, med rötter i New Public Management-teorin, är den
rådande förvaltningsmodellen för räddningsväsendet i Finland (SM018:00/2012;
Siverbo, 2004). Det finns 22 räddningsverk i Finland som lyder under kommunal
förvaltning, vilket innebär att kommunerna är ansvariga för att ordna räddningstjänster
inom det egna kommunområdet (Räddningslag, 379/2011). Kommunen köper
räddningstjänster av räddningsverket i enlighet med beställar-utförar-modellen.
Genom beslut om servicenivå har kommunen och räddningsverket avtalat om pris och
servicenivå för tjänsterna för en bestämd tidsperiod (SM018:00/2012). Tillämpning av
beställar-utförar-modellen

kräver

att

beställaren

har

tillgång

till

korrekt

kostnadsinformation för att kunna fastställa priset för upphandlade tjänster, så att priset
motsvarar de faktiska kostnaderna för tjänsteproduktionen (Tynkkynen, Keskimäki &
Lehto, 2013).
Fungerande kostnadsberäkningsmetoder är viktiga för organisationer som använder
beställar-utförar-modell som förvaltningsmodell, för att säkra tillgången till korrekt
kostnadsinformation. Syftet med denna avhandling är att undersöka hur offentliga
tjänsteorganisationer kan använda sig av kostnadsberäkningsmetoder för att svara på
behovet av detaljerad och korrekt kostnadsinformation, som grund för tillämpning av
beställar-utförar-modellen.
Förslaget till social- och hälsovårdsreform, som för tillfället är under behandling i den
finländska riksdagen, kommer att innebära förändringar även för räddningsväsendet.
Reformen

kommer

att

överföra

huvudansvaret

för

finansieringen

av

räddningsväsendet från kommunerna till staten (STM055:00/2019). Social- och
hälsovårdsreformen bidrar till ett ökat behov av jämförbar ekonomisk information
mellan räddningsverken.

71

De teorier som tas upp i avhandlingen berör finländsk redovisningspraxis för offentliga
organisationer, New Public Management-modellen och beställar-utförar-modellen,
internredovisning och kostnadsberäkningsmetoder för offentliga tjänstebolag. Denna
litteratur behandlas för att stöda avhandlingens analysdel.
Denna avhandling grundar sig på en fallstudie av det finska räddningsväsendet.
Fallstudien syftar till att belysa det finländska räddningsväsendets nuvarande
ekonomiska situation, samt att undersöka ifall rådande redovisningsmetoder och
existerande ekonomisk information fungerar som tillräcklig bas för beslutsfattande,
och hur dessa vid behov kunde utvecklas. I studien analyseras den ekonomiska
information som berör räddningsverken och som används som bas för beslutsfattandet.
Den ekonomiska information som används i studien är tagen från räddningsverkens
bokslut och från räddningsväsendets interna statistiska databas Pronto. Som tillägg till
den ekonomiska informationen från boksluten och den statistiska informationen från
Pronto, skickades ett frågeformulär till räddningsverkens ekonomiavdelning för att
samla in ytterligare information kring räddningsverkens kostnadsförings- och
bokföringsmetoder. De forskningsfrågor som definierats i denna avhandling har
besvarats genom analys av insamlad ekonomisk och statistisk information och genom
analys av svar på frågeformuläret.
Studiens resultat påvisar att det finns skillnader mellan räddningsverkens
kostnadsinformation och att kostnadsinformationen i verkligheten inte motsvarar alla
verkliga kostnader. Majoriteten av räddningsverken erhåller till exempel stödtjänster
från ägarkommunen utan att ett fullständigt pris faktureras för dessa tjänster, och vissa
tjänster fås av kommunen utan någon ersättning. Denna praxis gäller dock inte alla
räddningsverk, och det finns även skillnader mellan räddningsverken beträffande vilka
tjänster och funktioner det gäller. Denna
praxis leder till att det kan förekomma dolda kostnader inom kommunkoncernen som
inte framkommer i gällande kostnadsinformation. Kostnadsinformationen är inte fullt
jämförbar mellan de olika räddningsverken i och med att det förekommer stora
skillnader i intern fakturering av kostnader mellan de olika räddningsverken och inte
alla räddningsverk har korrekta uppgifter om de fullständiga kostnaderna. Genom att
utveckla räddningsverkens kostnadsberäkningsmetoder, samt genom att skapa

72

standardiserade metoder för hela branschen kunde den information som används som
bas för beslutsfattandet förbättras betydligt.
Genom analys av ekonomiska data och baserat på svaren på forskningsfrågorna, vilka
sammanställts och definierats enkom för denna avhandling, kom skribenten även fram
till

slutsatsen

att

ekonomistyrningsmetoder,

speciellt

olika

kostnadsberäkningsmetoder, kan stöda offentliga organisationer och beslutsfattande
inom den offentliga sektorn. Speciellt i samband med offentliga reformer, som syftar
till att skära ner kostnader och producera offentliga tjänster mer kostnadseffektivt,
spelar fungerande kostnadsberäkningsmetoder en central roll för beslutsfattandet.
Avhandlingens ämne är synnerligen aktuellt i och med social och hälsovårdsreformen,
men även för andra offentliga reformer, som syftar till att producera offentliga tjänster
mer kostnadseffektivt, samtidigt som tjänsterna förväntas bibehålla kvalitetsnivån.
Därmed har denna avhandling och dess studie bidragit med betydelsefulla insikter till
detta aktuella och relevanta forskningsområde.
Som fortsatt forskning föreslås att ett räddningsverks situation kunde studeras mer i
detalj och på djupet. Detta kunde göras till exempel genom intervjuer, mer djupgående
analys

av

kostnadsberäkningsmetoderna

och

observationer

över

beslutfattningsprocessen. Genom en mer djupgående analys av ett räddningsverks
situation kunde ytterligare insikter fås över hur kostnadsberäkningsmetoderna borde
utvecklas för att bättre stöda beslutsfattande på basen av korrekt framställda kostnader.
