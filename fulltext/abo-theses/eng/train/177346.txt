In western society, cancer is amongst the leading cause of death with millions of new cases diagnosed
annually. A key force driving carcinogenesis is metastasis, which is achieved by a mechanism inducing
cellular motility called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During normal conditions, EMT is
an important cellular program required for embryonal development and wound healing, but
unfortunately in cancer, this process is subverted in order to improve the invasion capacity of the
cancerous cells. One of the main inducers of EMT is the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)
signaling pathway, and sustained activation of this pathway has previously been linked to cancer
progression. In the field of cancer research, one key topic involves characterizing the crosstalk between
different signaling pathways, which together can relay a survival advantage to the cell. One important
survival pathway, that counteracts proteotoxic stress, is called the heat shock response (HSR). A key
regulatory protein in this pathway is the transcription factor HSF2, which can be active in normal and
pathological conditions. Unpublished results from the Sistonen laboratory have shown that the TGFβ
signaling pathway can reduce the expression of HSF2 in breast cancer cells, which might be important
for the progression of EMT. First, luciferase assay was used to determine which part of the HSF2
promoter regulates HSF2 expression during EMT. Second, wound healing assay was used to elucidate
whether HSF2 influences cellular invasion capacity upon EMT. Finally, western blot was utilized to
establish if HSF1 impacts HSF2 protein expression during EMT. The results revealed that the 5’UTR
of HSF2 is required for the downregulation of HSF2 during EMT, and it is likely that HSF2 inhibits the
cellular invasion capacity both during control conditions and upon EMT stimuli. Also, the gene
expression of HSF2 during EMT was shown not to be affected by HSF1, another HSF family member,
which has previously been indicated to affect the expression of HSF2. Taken together, the results from
my thesis provide the first evidence that HSF2 exhibits a functional role in EMT and cell invasion, thus
raising the possibility that HSF2 displays a tumor-suppressing function in breast cancer development.
I västvärlden är cancer fortfarande den främsta dödsorsaken och flera miljoner nya cancerfall
diagnostiseras årligen. Epitel-mesenkymal övergång (EMT) är ett av de huvudsakliga process som
bidrar till cancercellernas förmåga att metastasera. EMT är en normal cellulär process som sker vid
embryonalutveckling och sårläkning. Vid EMT erhåller cellerna distinkta egenskaper som främjar
cellvandring genom förändringar i signalräckor som styr cellrörelser. En av de huvudsakliga
signalräckorna som styr EMT är transformerande tillväxtfaktor beta (TGFβ), och ökad aktivering av
denna signalräcka har tidigare anknutits till cancerutveckling. Ett nyckeltema inom cancerforskning
involverar karakterisering av samverkan mellan de olika signalräckorna som tillsammans kan stöda
cellens överlevnadsförmåga. En av dessa signalräckor är värmechockresponsen (HSR), som regleras av
värmechockfaktorer så som HSF2. HSF2 har tidigare visats kunna hämma cancerformation och
opublicerade resultat från Sistonens laboratorium har visat att uttrycket av HSF2 påverkas av TGFβsignalräckan, därmed är det möjligt att HSF2 har en viktig roll i EMT och cancerutveckling. I denna
studie undersöktes HSF2s funktion vid EMT. Detta gjordes genom att utreda vilken del av HSF2promotorn reglerar HSF2-genuttrycket vid EMT. För detta ändamål utnyttjades kloning- och
luciferasmetoder för att bestämma HSF2 promotoraktiviteten. Därtill studerades hur HSF2 påverkar
cellernas invasionsförmåga vid EMT genom att mäta cellernas migrationshastighet och slutligen
användes western blot för att bestämma om HSF1 kan styra uttrycket av HSF2 vid EMT. Resultaten
visade att 5’UTR av HSF2 är viktig för nedregleringen av HSF2-genuttrycket vid EMT och att HSF2
kan hämma migrationsförmågan i cellerna under EMT. Dessutom bekräftades att genuttrycket av HSF2
inte styrs av HSF1 vid EMT. Sammanlagt ger min avhandling de första bevisen på att HSF2 uppvisar
en viktigt regulatorisk funktion under EMT och cellinvasion, samt antyder att HSF2 kan ha en
tumörhämmande effekt i bröstcancerutvecklingen.

1 Introduction
The cells that build up a multicellular organism maintain a complex signaling network
to maintain intracellular homeostasis. This network is modulated in response to both
extracellular and intracellular cues that help the cell to adjust to changes in the
environment. Although cells have coping mechanisms that protect them against
various stresses, some of the cells may occasionally break free from the normally
strictly controlled signaling networks and begin to divide uncontrollably. Malignant
transformation is enabled by a variety of mechanisms including accumulation of
mutations in genes regulating the activities of key signaling pathways. An important
process contributing to the migration capacity of cells is epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). This cellular program is normally involved in developmental
processes, tissue establishment, and wound healing, however, it can also be hijacked
by cancer cells to improve their invasion abilities and allow metastasis. One of the
essential pathways that induce EMT is the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
signaling pathway. The activity of this pathway is downregulated in the early stages
of cancer, but is shifted to an increased activity as the cancer progression proceeds.
The TGFβ signaling pathway has also been shown to modulate the activity of a
transcription factor called heat shock factor 2 (HSF2). HSF2 belongs to the family of
heat shock factors (HSFs), which are the key factors modulating the activity of a
pathway that is activated in response to proteotoxic stress. The heat shock response
(HSR) is one of the major pathways that HSFs induce, however, they are also involved
in modulating developmental processes and pathologies such as cancer.
An impaired function of HSFs has been linked to the formation of numerous types of
cancers. Recently, HSF2 was discovered to function as a tumor suppressor in prostate
cancer and the disease progression was correlated with a decreased expression of
HSF2. Additionally, unpublished results from the Sistonen laboratory have indicated
that HSF2 expression is modulated by TGFβ signaling. Owing to these discoveries,
the main objective of this thesis was to elucidate what regulates HSF2 expression upon
EMT and to determine whether the expression of HSF2 impacts cellular invasion
capacity during EMT.

2 Overview of Literature
2.1 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
The capability of cancer cells to invade new tissues and metastasize largely depends
on their ability to enhance cellular motility, which is modulated by multiple signaling
pathways. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the key processes
contributing to the migratory capacity of epithelial cells, and under normal
physiological conditions this process is required for cell motility during embryonal
development and wound healing of damaged tissues. The EMT process is guided by
alterations in several molecular mechanisms, which together allow for a phenotypic
switch.
2.1.1 Cellular changes during EMT
EMT is a process where epithelial cells transiently gain a mesenchymal state, and it
generally occurs during embryogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, and wound healing
(Nieto, 2009; Kalluri & Weinberg, 2009; Thiery et al. 2009; Nieto et al. 2016).
Epithelial cells form cell sheets that line the mammalian internal cavities such as the
digestive tract. In order to establish a cell sheet, these cells are nonmotile, they display
an apical-basal polarity, and are connected to adjacent cells as well as to the underlying
basement membrane via junctions consisting of multiprotein adhesion complexes and
cytoskeletal components. The epithelial cell polarity is generated by distinct basal,
lateral, and apical plasma membrane regions, each displaying a unique set of proteins
that convey the distinctive features for each region (Lee & Streuli, 2014). The
mechanism contributing to epithelial cell polarity remains unknown. However, it has
been suggested that it could be maintained by a positive feedback loop created by the
activity of polarity-involved proteins or by directed exocytosis guided by apical and
basal determinants (Klunder et al. 2017). In order to enable the formation of a sheet,
epithelial cells are connected to each other at the lateral sides and to the underlying
basement membrane at the basal side. Several cell-cell junctions are displayed
between adjacent epithelial cells including tight junctions, which are indispensable in
forming a continuous cell sheet without gaps thus preventing leakage of molecules.
Other important junctions include adherens junctions, which connect the neighboring
cells together via actin bundles, desmosomes, which connect the neighboring cells via
intermediate filaments, and gap junctions, which enable diffusion of small ions and
6

Jenny Pessa

molecules between the adjacent cells maintaining a similar intracellular ion
concentration (Lampe & Lau, 2004). Additionally, hemidesmosomes attach the
epithelial cells at their basal region to the underlying basement membrane via
intermediate filaments. These junctional complexes together with the apical-basal
polarity maintain the integrity of the epithelial cell sheet, however, this integrity is lost
when the cells are predisposed to signals inducing EMT, which is followed by major
alterations in these integrity-maintaining features.
During EMT, the epithelial cell morphology is lost and a mesenchymal morphology
is adopted by the cells. Mesenchymal cells display a spindle-shaped morphology,
front-to-back polarity, heavily rearranged cytoskeleton accompanied by stress fiber
formation, and an enhanced migratory ability since they are not connected to adjacent
cells or to the underlying basement membrane via junctions (Dongre & Weinberg,
2019). The front-to-back polarity enables cellular movement in one direction as a socalled leading edge, usually defined by the formation of membrane protrusions such
as lamellipodia or filopodia (Figure 1), which are generated by actin polymerization
that extends the protruding front end of the cell in the direction of movement also
allowing attachment to nearby a surface (Trepat et al. 2012). At the back end of
mesenchymal cells, previously formed adhesions are disrupted and the contraction of
stress fibers pulls the rear forward allowing movement. Stress fibers are filament
bundles comprised of actin filaments and non-muscle myosin II displaying contractile
activity important in morphogenesis and cell adhesion (Kreis & Birchmeier, 1980).
Additionally, the induction of EMT results in the disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix
junctions, mainly guided by the alterations in the gene expression pattern, which is a
prerequisite to acquire the ability of cellular motility featured by mesenchymal cells.
The secretion of proteins that disrupt the underlying membrane and the surrounding
extracellular matrix (ECM), such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), serves to
further increase cellular motility (Miyoshi et al. 2004; Miyoshi et al. 2005). The ECM
is a 3D network rich in glycoproteins and collagen providing structural support for the
surrounding cells. MMPs are zinc-containing proteinases that mainly operate to
degrade the ECM and ECM-involved proteins, but can additionally degrade a large set
of other molecules (Verma & Hansch, 2007). Together these features obtained via
EMT account for the mesenchymal state morphology, however the mesenchymal cell
still maintain the capacity to return to an epithelial state.

Figure 1. The morphology and characteristic features of epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
Epithelial cells (left) display a polygonal morphology, an apical-basal polarity and are attached to
adjacent cells as well as to the underlying basement membrane (grey) via junctional adhesion
complexes indicated as blue lines between cells and black lines between cells and basement membrane,
respectively, enabling the formation of an intact cell sheet. Induction of EMT results in the switch to a
mesenchymal cell state (right) that displays a spindle-shaped morphology and an improved motility due
to the disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Mesenchymal cells also display a front-to-back
polarity and stress fibers (indicated as a grey arrow), that together enable directional cell movement,
which is typically characterized by the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia indicated as a green and
blue arrow, respectively. The mesenchymal cells can switch back to the epithelial cell state via the
reverse process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET).

Mesenchymal cells are in some cases capable to transit back to an epithelial state
through the reverse process called mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET is
utilized by cells especially during developmental stages to generate epithelial tissue
via re-establishment of epithelial features (Pei et al. 2019), and is thought to occur
directly as a consequence of the shutdown of EMT-involved transcription factors
(EMT-TFs), that promote the transition back to the epithelial state (Tsai et al. 2012,
Ocana et al. 2012; Schmidt et al. 2015, Beerling et al. 2016). Importantly, MET has
also been proposed as an essential mechanism driving the final steps of the so-called
invasion-metastasis cascade that promotes the attachment of cancer cells to distantly
located tissues, which subsequently advances the formation of new cancer colonies
(Nieto et al. 2016; Pattabiraman et al. 2016). Although the process has been identified,
no MET-inducing TFs or proteins have been identified to this date.

2.2 The function of EMT during development and wound healing
The EMT program was first identified when profound alterations in the morphology
and cellular movement of cultured epithelial cells were observed by Greenburg and
Hay in 1982 (Greenburg & Hay, 1982). Since then, further research has been able to
identify that EMT contributes to the regulation of many developmental events
including gastrulation, where EMT is used to acquire mesenchymal cells to form the
mesodermal layer (Oda et al. 1998; Lim & Thiery, 2012; Schafer et al. 2014), and
neural crest cell activation, where the improved cellular migration capacity enables
the dispersion of these cells throughout the developing embryo (Shoval et al. 2007;
Clay & Halloran, 2014; Simoes-Costa & Bronner, 2015). Furthermore, EMT has also
been shown to facilitate neural crest development and palatal fusion in the developing
mouse embryo via SNAI1 and SNAI2-induced suppression of E-cadherin expression
(Aybar et al. 2003; Martinez-Alvarez et al. 2004). EMT is also important for tissue
regeneration and wound healing. These processes are facilitated by EMT to allow cells
to migrate to the damaged location, enhance proliferation, and following these events,
revert back to re-establish the integrity of the epithelial sheet (et al. 2016). One of the
TFs regulating EMT that plays an essential role in this process is SNAI2, whose
increased expression was demonstrated to result in degradation of desmosomal
junctions in human keratinocytes (Savagner et al. 2005).
2.3 EMT in cancer progression and invasion
Early-stage neoplastic cells display an epithelial-like state but during cancer
progression, a more-mesenchymal state is gradually adopted. Cancer cells actively
undergoing EMT have been implicated to facilitate acquisition of a cancer stem cell
(CSC) state and to acquire an increased therapeutic drug resistance. The mechanistical
regulation of EMT in cancer progression is still poorly understood, but the importance
cannot be undermined as it can plausibly be an integral component in the evolution of
all types of malignant carcinomas (Blanco et al. 2002; Gravdal et al. 2007; Prudkin et
al. 2009; Rhim et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015; Ye et al. 2015; Mahmood
et al. 2017; Roth et al. 2017). The course of events leading to distant metastatic colonyformation is commonly known as the invasion-metastasis cascade. Numerous attempts
trying to unravel the most prominently mutated driver genes have consistently failed,
though the accessibility of genome-wide sequencing and comprehensive

9

Jenny Pessa

bioinformatics analyses. This implies that some of the steps involved in the invasionmetastasis cascade might be driven by non-genetic processes, such as EMT
(Vogelstein et al. 1989). For instance, it is known that metastasizing carcinoma cells
typically display expression patterns that closely resemble those of activated EMT
programs. It has been reported that expression of a transcription factor called zincfinger E-box-binding homeobox factor-1 (ZEB1) is necessary for enabling metastasis
in pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a mouse model (Ye et al. 2015), and that SNAI1 is
required for dissemination of mouse carcinoma cells (Krebs et al. 2017). The
importance of SNAI2 was demonstrated in a further study, where non-metastatic cells
obtained increased metastatic abilities in response to induced SNAI2 expression (Guo
et al. 2012). These studies provide evidence that the primary carcinoma can evolve
invasion and metastasis capabilities via expression of EMT-TFs orchestrating the
induction of EMT (Guo et al. 2012), implying that at least a transient expression of
EMT is indispensable for metastatic progression of carcinoma cells.
2.4 EMT-inducing transcription factors
The observed alterations in the cellular appearance after an EMT induction are a direct
consequence of major modifications in the gene expression pattern affecting cellular
attachment, organization of cytoskeletal components, and the expressed polarity. The
gene expression pattern is altered so that epithelial-state maintaining genes are
suppressed and mesenchymal-state maintaining genes are instead induced (Figure 2).
These alterations in gene expression are modulated by associated transcription factors
(EMT-TFs) regulating the activity of EMT-involved genes.
The gene expression pattern characteristic of epithelial cells includes several genes
encoding proteins that are important for the formation of junctional cell-cell and cellmatrix complexes and genes that are responsible for maintaining the apical-basal
polarity. Probably the most important epithelial marker is epithelial cadherin (Ecadherin), which is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the
family of classical cadherins and is essential in the establishment of adherens junctions
(Brüser & Bogdan, 2017). The loss of E-cadherin expression is seen as one of the key
identifiers of induced EMT. Other important epithelial markers, whose
downregulation implies an activated EMT process, are for instance occludins and
claudins, which together enable the assembly of tight junctions (González-Mariscal et
10

Jenny Pessa

al. 2003). The tight junction assembly is assisted by PALS1-associated tight junction
protein (PATJ) and lethal giant larvae (LGL) protein, that are also important in
maintaining the apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells (Aigner et al. 2007; Spaderna
et al. 2008). When EMT is activated, the expression of these and many other epithelial
state-involved genes are repressed by the action of EMT-TFs such as the zinc-finger
E-box-binding homeobox factors ZEB1 and ZEB2, SNAI1 (Snail), SNAI2 (Slug), and
the helix-loop-helix factors TWIST1 and TWIST2 (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). ZEB1
and ZEB2 affect E-cadherin expression by binding to E-box elements located in the
promoter region of the E-cadherin gene, CDH1 (Hill et al. 2013), and by recruiting
histone deacetylases, which result in chromatin condensation leading to the
transcriptional repression of E-cadherin and thereby the induction of EMT (Singh and
Settleman, 2010; Hanrahan et al. 2017). SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1, and TWIST2
inhibit E-cadherin expression in much the same way as ZEB transcription factors via
repressing the transcriptional activity by binding to the E-box elements in the promoter
region (Batlle et al. 2000; Cano et al. 2000; Herranz et al. 2008). ZEB1 and SNAI1
also repress the expression of the apical-basal polarity-maintaining genes (Aigner et
al. 2007; Spaderna et al. 2008), inducing the disruption of the epithelial cell sheet
integrity. Moreover, SNAI1 and ZEB2 have been shown to induce the expression of
MMPs, which, as previously described, are proteinases that function to degrade the
ECM and related proteins thereby promoting the invasion capacity of cells (Miyoshi
et al. 2004; Miyoshi et al. 2005).
The EMT induction by transcriptional repression of epithelial state-associated genes
is not the only function of the EMT-TFs, but they simultaneously induce the
transcription of mesenchymal state-involved genes (Figure 2). Thus, EMT-TFs
display a dual function in inducing the EMT program. For instance, neural cadherin
(N-cadherin) and vimentin expression is upregulated when the EMT program is
activated serving as markers indicating the mesenchymal state (Jennbacken et al.
2010; Wang et al. 2016; Loh et al. 2019). N-cadherin is a transmembrane cell adhesion
molecule that belongs to the same protein superfamily as E-cadherin (Shapiro et al.
1995). It is generally accepted that a switch in cadherin expression, downregulation of
E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin, is associated with EMT and an improved
cellular invasion capacity, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Ncadherin expression is frequently induced during EMT and is thereby seen as one of
11

Jenny Pessa

the most important identifiers of the mesenchymal state (Jennbacken et al. 2010; Wang
et al. 2016; Loh et al. 2019). Whereas vimentin is a dynamic protein that belongs to
type the III intermediate filament family proteins, providing structural support to the
cell and it is also typically expressed in mesenchymal cells (Liu et al. 2015),
functioning as an additional example of a marker of EMT. The function of the
addressed EMT-TFs, among others, guide the phenotypic changes from the epithelial
characteristics to mesenchymal ones, and the activation of these EMT-TFs is in turn
modulated by several signaling pathways.

Figure 2. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The activation of the EMT process is modulated by
transcription factors (EMT-TFs) that regulate the expression of genes involved in EMT. The
advancement of EMT is indicated by the switch from an epithelial state-expressing cell (light orange),
which is attached to the underlying basement membrane (grey), to the motile mesenchymal stateexpressing cell (red) via an intermediate state (brown), displaying partly epithelial and partly
mesenchymal features. The mesenchymal cells have acquired a high invasion capacity and are able to
invade through the basement membrane.

2.5 Signaling pathways regulating EMT
Multiple intracellular signaling pathways can stimulate the induction of EMT. These
pathways are activated by the epithelial cells in response to signaling molecules
released by the surrounding microenvironment. Ligand binding to the cognate
receptors displayed on the cell surface of epithelial cells trigger a cascade of signaling
events that eventually culminate in the activation of the EMT process. The main
mechanism of action, in which a certain signaling pathway induces EMT, involves the
activation of the major EMT-TFs, which together facilitate acquirement of the
12

Jenny Pessa

mesenchymal state. TGFβ (Xu et al. 2009), NOTCH (Timmerman et al. 2004), and
WNT (Savagner, 2001) are known to be important pathways involved in activating
EMT by inducing the expression of EMT-TFs, and the functions of these pathways
have also been implicated to regulate EMT during cancer progression (Bierie &
Moses, 2006; Su et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2014; Ma et al. 2017; Tang et
al. 2017; Ramachandran et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018).
2.5.1 TGFβ signaling pathway
One of the key signaling pathways activating the EMT process is called transforming
growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway (Bierie et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2009;
Lamouille et al. 2014). The TGFβ signaling pathway is involved in several cellular
processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, production of the
extracellular matrix (ECM), secretion of cytokines, and cancer cell motility (Moses et
al. 1990; Heldin et al. 2012, Loomans & Andl, 2014). The pathway activation is
mediated by ligand binding to its reciprocal receptor complex constituted of TGFβ
receptor type 1 (TGFβR1) and TGFβ receptor type 2 (TGFβR2). One way to induce
the pathway is by the so-called canonical pathway mechanism, which relies on SMAD
protein activation. The signaling pathway induction is initiated by ligand-binding to
its cognate receptor displayed on the cell surface. Multiple ligands belong to the TGFβ
ligand family including three types of TGFβ isoforms, multiple bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs), and two activins (Dongre & Weinberg, 2019). Ligand-binding to the
receptor monomer causes TGFβR2 to phosphorylate and activate TGFβR1, which in
turn phosphorylates proteins of the R-SMAD family, usually SMAD2 and SMAD3
proteins. Activated R-SMADs form heterotrimers with SMAD4 proteins and the
complex is translocated to the nucleus where it functions as a target gene transcription
regulator, inducing for example the EMT process (Figure 3) (Cantelli et al. 2017). The
transcriptional regulation of genes is orchestrated in cooperation with other
transcription factors, co-activators, co-factors, and adaptors, enabling a large set of
biological responses to be yielded from a single pathway.

Figure 3. The transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway. The TGFβ signaling pathway is
activated by the TGFβ-1 ligand (orange) binding to the TGFβR2 receptor monomer (blue). This binding
initiates receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation. The activated receptor dimer
phosphorylates proteins of the R-SMAD family (SMAD2 and SMAD3), which stimulates complex
formation with SMAD4 proteins. The formed SMAD-complex is subsequently translocated to the
nucleus where it binds to DNA and functions as a transcriptional regulator of target gene activity, for
instance, stimulating the transcription of EMT-inducing genes.

2.5.2 Other signaling pathways involved in modulating EMT
As described previously for the TFs, the regulation of EMT is not based on the
induction of a single component but rather on the interplay between associated
signaling pathways that together modulate the initiation as well as the magnitude of
EMT-TF expression. An additional pathway modulating the induction of EMT is the
WNT signaling pathway, which is activated when one of its 19 identified ligands bind
to the cell surface receptors of the Frizzled family. The binding event induces a series
of events that eventually lead to the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus. β-catenin
is a transcriptional co-factor that stimulates the transcription of its target genes that are
generally involved in cell fate determination, differentiation, proliferation, and
tumorigenesis (Clevers, 2006; Lamouille et al. 2014). During the epithelial cell state,
β-catenin is sequestered at the cell membrane in adherens junctions, but the disruption
of junctional complexes in response to stimulated EMT frees the bound β-catenin and
allows it to be directly used for the WNT signaling pathway, which in turn stimulates
further advancement of EMT (Balsamo et al. 1998). Additionally, active WNT
signaling directly induces the gene transcription of EMT-TFs including ZEB1,
TWIST, and SNAI2 by the β-catenin molecule directly binding to their promoter
regions and thereby inducing the gene expression (Sanchez-Tillo et al. 2010). The
WNT pathway is seen as one of the key activators of the EMT process as the absence

14

Jenny Pessa

of the WNT ligand has been shown to significantly disrupt the function of the
developmental EMT process by for instance impairing mesoderm, and neural crest
cell formation (Liu et al. 1999; Garcia-Castro et al. 2002). In addition, WNT signaling
has also been implicated to have a role in cancer progression via stimulating EMT and
cancer stem cell formation in several carcinomas (Derynck et al. 2014; Gonzalez &
Medici, 2014; Batlle & Clevers, 2017; de Sousa et al. 2017; Tammela et al. 2017).
Another signaling pathway, involved in modulating cell fate, proliferation, and
differentiation (Kopan, 2002; Osborne & Minter, 2007; Bray, 2016), implicated in the
modulation of EMT is NOTCH. The key components in this pathway are the Deltalike or Jagged ligands, which bind to the NOTCH receptors 1-4 (NOTCH1-4) inducing
a series of proteolytic cleavages that result in the generation of the functional NOTCH
ligand that translocates to the nucleus and regulates target gene transcription by
associating with transcriptional activators and binding partners (Kopan, 2002;
Osborne & Minter, 2007). The NOTCH pathway has been implicated in EMT
activation especially during developmental stages, as NOTCH has been shown to be
expressed in the same embryonic regions as EMT is actively expressed, and cells with
abolished NOTCH1 have been shown both to fail SNAI1 expression and fail to induce
EMT (Timmerman et al. 2004). Furthermore, NOTCH has been shown to cooperate
with the TGFβ signaling pathway in order to induce EMT. The interplay between these
two pathways have been demonstrated to rely on SMAD proteins, which associate
with the active NOTCH ligand and together induce the expression of multiple target
genes including those that support adopting the mesenchymal state (Blokziil et al.
2003; Zavadil et al. 2004; Derynck et al. 2014). Also, as for the previously discussed
signaling pathways, NOTCH signaling has been indicated to modulate the EMT
process in several types of carcinomas (Yuan et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2017). In these
cases, NOTCH signaling is abnormally overexpressed causing a continuous EMT
stimulation and thereby predisposing the cells to malignant transformation
(Natsuizaka et al. 2017).
2.5.3 The TGFβ signaling pathway in cancer
Since the TGFβ pathway is a signaling cascade involved in various fundamental
biological processes, its malfunction is inevitably to cause serious diseases such as
cancer. The TGFβ pathway has been proposed to display a dual role in tumor
15

Jenny Pessa

progression functioning as a suppressor in early stage tumorigenesis (Massagué, 2012;
Derynck & Miyazono, 2017) and as an inducer during the later stages as the tumor
progression advances (Derynck et al. 2001; Massagué, 2008). During the more
advanced stages of tumor progression, TGFβ signaling is usually impaired by
mutations or deletions in the reciprocal receptors or the SMAD proteins, which are the
key proteins in the so-called canonical TGFβ signaling pathway (Massagué, 2008;
Derynck & Miyazono, 2017). However, some types of cancers, especially carcinomas,
tend to sustain functional TGFβ signaling which is instead hijacked by the cancer cells
in order to promote EMT and allow an increased invasion capacity and result in
metastatic dissemination (Massagué, 2008; Derynck & Miyazono, 2017).
The interplay between TGFβ signaling and EMT appears to be a crucial cornerstone
in cancer progression and have been extensively studied during the recent years.
Research regarding TGFβ-induced EMT in cancer has revealed a clear correlation
between these two phenomena in several types of cancers including epithelial, lung,
liver, prostate, and breast cancers (Franco et al. 2010; Mise et al. 2012; Shiota et al.
2012; Bertran et al. 2013; Pu et al. 2014; Salvo et al. 2014; Thakur et al. 2014; Parvani
et al. 2015; Bae et al. 2016; Cantelli et al. 2017). For instance in breast and lung cancer,
TGFβ signaling has been shown to modulate integrin expression leading to improved
migratory abilities of cells, dissemination, and metastasis (Mise et al. 2012; Salvo et
al. 2014; Parvani et al. 2015; Bae et al. 2016). In addition, TGFβ-induced EMT
regulates the expression of EMT-TFs, which has also been reported to confer apoptotic
resistance resulting in an enhanced survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (Franco et al.
2010). However, the tumor-supporting abilities provided by TGFβ signaling are not
strictly restrained to carcinomas, but it has also been implicated that the local invasion
of non-epithelial cancer cells can be regulated via TGFβ signaling (Joseph et al. 2014;
Mahabir et al. 2014). During the past decade, research has been focusing on
identifying additional TFs involved in the context of the TGFβ signaling cascade,
EMT, and cancer. Recently, attention towards the role of heat shock factors (HSFs) in
these processes have gained an exceeding amount of interest and it has been
substantiated that many of the HSF family transcription factors do play a key role in
cancer progression. For instance, both HSF1, and just recently, HSF2, have been
implicated to function in EMT and thereby in the evolution of cancer.

2.6 The heat shock response
Cells are continuously exposed to various kinds of environmental stresses that
predisposes them to disturbances in proteostasis, and they have therefore evolved
coping mechanisms including transcriptional programs to re-establish the internal
physiological balance and counteract the damage. One such program is the heat shock
response (HSR), which is a pathway cells activate upon protein-damaging conditions.
The HSR was first described by Ferruccio Ritossa in the 1960s, who identified a
pattern indicating increased transcription in regions of chromosome puffs in the
salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster larvae (Ritossa, 1962). Further research
during the following decade showed that the induced level of transcription in the
chromosome puffs encoded heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are molecular
chaperones synthesized by cells in response to protein-damaging stress (Tissiéres et
al. 1974). Later, HSF1 was identified as the master transcription factor regulating the
HSR (Parker & Topol, 1984) and further research was able to characterize additional
HSFs (Schuetz et al. 1991; Nakai et al. 1993; Nakai et al. 1997).
The HSR is highly conserved across species and has been identified in nearly all cell
and tissue types of multicellular organisms. Mechanistically in eukaryotes, the HSR
pathway is initiated by heat shock factors (HSFs). Upon activation, these transcription
factors form homo- and heterotrimers that are translocated into the nucleus where they
bind to a specific DNA sequence called the heat shock element (HSE) (Åkerfelt et al.
2007), which is located in the promoter region of genes encoding heat shock proteins
(HSPs) (Amin et al. 1988). The binding of activated HSF trimers to the HSEs induce
target gene transcription resulting in the synthesis of HSPs and other target proteins
(Figure 4). The synthesized HSPs are molecular chaperones that bind to proteins
stabilizing their conformation and function (Åkerfelt et al. 2010). HSFs are also
important in regulating a variety of transcriptional programs driving physiological
processes including differentiation and organ development. Furthermore, the
importance of these factors have also been implicated in pathological conditions,
including many different types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases such as
Huntington’s (Gomez-Pastor et al. 2017) and Alzheimer’s disease (Campanella et al.
2018).

17

Jenny Pessa

Figure 4. The heat shock response. The heat shock response (HSR) is activated in response to
proteotoxic stress, which induces heat shock factor (HSF) trimerization in the cytosol. Trimerized HSFs
are translocated to the nucleus where they bind to heat shock elements (HSEs) and stimulate the
transcription of target genes. Actively transcribed target genes result in the synthesis of e.g. heat shock
proteins (HSPs), which function as molecular chaperons maintaining proper folding and function of
proteins, thereby helping the cell to cope against stress.

2.7 Heat shock factors
HSFs are transcription factors modulating the activity of multiple transcriptional
programs that allow the cell to adapt to alterations in environmental and intracellular
conditions. These programs include, for instance, those activated in response to
protein-damaging stress and upon processes involved in development and
differentiation (Abane & Mezger, 2010; Joutsen & Sistonen, 2019). The capacity of
HSFs to induce a transcriptional program is modulated by several factors such as posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which can either have an inducing or an inhibiting
effect.
2.7.1 The domain structure of HSFs
Six HSFs have been identified to be encoded by the human genome including HSF1,
HSF2, HSF4, HSF5, HSFX, and HSFY (Gomez-Pastor et al. 2018). The members of
the HSF family are characterized by domains displaying unique structural and
functional features (Figure 5). A common feature for all HSFs, and the most conserved
of these domains, is the winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD) located
at the amino-terminal end (Vuister et al. 1994; Åkerfelt et al. 2010). This highly
18

Jenny Pessa

conserved domain enables HSF-binding to the cis-acting HSEs in the promoter region
of the target gene. The HSE comprises inverted pentameric nGAAn repeats, “n” being
any possible nucleotide, and the HSF typically requires at least two HSE motifs for
successful binding (Jaeger et al. 2014). In difference to many other transcription
factors, HSFs function as trimers upon activation. The trimerization process is enabled
by a leucine zipper oligomerization domain which is constituted of two heptad repeats,
HR-A and HR-B (Sorger and Nelson, 1989; Peteranderl et al. 1999). These heptad
repeats are thought to participate in oligomerization via their charged and hydrophobic
residues susceptible to inter-molecular leucine zipper formation (Rabindran et al.
1993), and are therefore essential for the trimerization and activation of HSFs. A HRC domain functions as a repressor to inhibit spontaneous trimerization of HSFs during
unstressed conditions (Rabindran et al. 1993). This repressor domain has been shown
to be missing from HSF4 resulting in the generation of continuously active HSF4
trimers (Nakai et al. 1997). Furthermore, some HSFs contain an alternative domain
rich in acidic and hydrophobic residues called a transactivation domain (TAD). This
domain is located at the carboxy-terminal end and is considered essential for the
induction of the transcriptional response (Sullivan et al. 2001). In addition, HSF1
contains a regulatory domain (RD), which is responsible for controlling the activation
during stress conditions and also for the repression of the TAD during unstressed
conditions, is located between the HR-A and HR-B domains (Green et al. 1995).

Figure 5. The domain structures of human heat shock factors (HSFs). Six different HSFs are
expressed in humans, HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSF5, HSFX, and HSFY. All HSFs contain an
evolutionarily highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4 also contain a
hydrophobic heptad repeat domain (HR-A/B), which is responsible for mediating oligomerization, and
a regulatory domain (RD), which is known to modulate stress responsiveness in HSF1. The HR-C
domain in HSF1 and HSF2 prevents spontaneous trimerization upon unstressed conditions. The
transactivation domain, present in HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4, controls transcriptional activity. The
complete domain structure has not yet been validated for HSF5, HSFX, and HSFY.

2.7.2 Trimerization and regulation of HSFs
During normal physiological conditions, HSF1 is present as inert monomers that
shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Likewise during these conditions the
core region of the HSP promoter is pre-loaded with stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol
II) and other transcription-associated components that maintain the promoter region
in an open state (Fujimoto et al. 2012; Mahat et al. 2016). However, exposure to stress
causes the nuclear export of HSF1 to be restricted and thereby results in a rapid
accumulation of HSF1 monomers in the nucleoplasm (Budzynski & Sistonen, 2017).
Proteotoxic stress is also accompanied by HSF1 monomer-oligomerization and thus
the formation of HSF1 trimers. Subsequently, HSF1 trimers bind to HSEs and interact
with additional transcription factors and co-activators, which leads to the opening of
the chromatin structure and promotes the releasement of the stalled Pol II, which in
turn enhances the transcription of target genes (Sarge et al. 1993; Vihervaara et al.
2013; Himanen & Sistonen, 2019). Currently, the major activation mechanism of
HSF1 is considered to be the chaperone titration model. According to this model, the
activity of HSF1 is regulated by HSP chaperones, such as HSP70/HSPA1A and
20

Jenny Pessa

HSP90/HSPC (Le Breton & Mayer, 2016), which are recruited to damaged proteins
when the cell is exposed to proteotoxic stress. As a consequence of this recruitment
process, HSF1 is dissociated from the chaperone complex, which normally keeps it
inert. The chaperone titration model has been supported by studies in different
organisms for instance, in mammals the HSR was shown to be activated upon
pharmaceutical inhibition of the HSP90/HSPC chaperone (Powers & Workman,
2007), whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a robust HSF-1 induction was
observed in response to Hsp-70 ablation (Guisbert et al. 2013).
The detailed mechanism of transcriptional attenuation of the HSR remains unknown,
but it has been suggested that at least two mechanisms contribute to HSF1 attenuation.
First, the chaperone titration model has been proposed to modulate the activity of
HSF1 also by promoting attenuation via a negative feedback mechanism created by
the HSPs. A second attenuation mechanism is based on decreasing the DNA-binding
affinity of HSF1, which is achieved by acetylation of specific residues in the DBD
(Westerheide et al. 2009). The attenuation is thought to occur in response to a
prolonged exposure to stress. The chaperone titration model has been suggested to
regulate HSR activation and attenuation via stress-induced accumulation of HSPs that
have been shown to facilitate interaction with HSF1. This interaction impairs the
trans-activation capacity of HSF1 as well as induces the assembly of transcriptional
co-repressors to the HSP promoter inhibiting the function of HSF1 (Gómez et al.
2008). The second HSF1 attenuation mechanism has been shown to be reliant on
acetylation of two specific lysine residues in the DBD, lysine 80 and lysine 118
(Westerheide et al. 2009; Raychaudhuri et al. 2014). Acetylation of these residues
during stress causes the releasement of DNA-bound HSF1, which is one of the key
steps contributing to the attenuation process. The DBD acetylation status is modulated,
at least partly, by a transcription factor called activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1),
which recruits an acetyl transferase complex called CBP/p300 to the DNA-bound
HSF1 (Takii et al. 2015). However, the DBD-acetylation stimulating HSR attenuation
can be counteracted by a deacetylase, SIRT1, and histone acetylases, HDAC7 and
HDAC9, which can thereby alter the acetylation status of the DBD and prolong the
HSR (Westerheide et al. 2009; Zelin & Freeman, 2015).
In contrast to HSF1, HSF2 is typically present as cytosolic dimers already during
unstressed conditions. However, HSF2 is similarly activated and trimerized upon
21

Jenny Pessa

stimulation, which induces its DNA-binding activity and results in transcriptional
activation of its target genes (Sistonen et al. 1994; Mathew et al. 1998). During heat
shock, the attenuation of HSF2 is mainly modulated via proteosomal degradation,
demonstrated by studies showing that HSF2 is susceptible to ubiquitylation and is
therefore directed for degradation by the proteasome (Ahlskog et al. 2010).
The oligomerization domains of HSF1 and HSF2 display significant sequence
homology (Schuetz et al. 1991). This sequence homology is thought to be a key feature
in enabling HSF1 and HSF2 binding to DNA as heterotrimeric complexes (Sandqvist
et al. 2009). The transcriptional properties of the trimer has been shown to be affected
by the abundance of each transcription factor (Sandqvist et al. 2009). Moreover,
heterotrimerization of HSF1 and HSF2 has been shown to modulate a distinct
transcriptional program when exposed to alcohol, where the specific transcriptional
effect was lost if either transcription factor was ablated (El Fatimy et al. 2014).
2.7.3 Mechanisms modulating the activity of HSFs
One major mechanism contributing to the modulation of HSF activity includes posttranslational modifications (PTMs). For instance, HSF1 is susceptible to many PTMs
during the HSR including phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation. To this date,
23 serine and threonine residues prone to phosphorylation have been discovered in
human HSF1. Most of these residues are located in the RD domain and the majority
of them have a repressive effect on the transcriptional activity (Cotto et al. 1996).
Phosphorylation of HSF1 has been shown to repress its spontaneous activation during
unstressed conditions (Chu et al. 1996; Kline & Morimoto, 1997; Chu et al. 1998) and
to modulate its degradation during stress-predisposing conditions via interaction with
a ubiquitin ligase (Kourtis et al. 2015). However, HSF1 is also subjected to activating
phosphorylations, one of the most important ones being the phosphorylation site on
serine 326, which is seen as a hallmark of HSF1 activation (Boellman et al. 2004;
Guettouche et al. 2005; Shah et al. 2016). Moreover, HSF1 is frequently sumoylated
on lysine 298 (Hong et al. 2001; Hietakangas et al. 2003), though contradictory results
were presented by the two original studies, regarding the importance of this
sumoylation in the HSR induction, demonstrating that the exact impact of this
modification remains unclear and might be dependent on the biological context.
Sumoylation has also been demonstrated to negatively modulate the transactivation
22

Jenny Pessa

capacity of HSF1 during stress conditions (Hietakangas et al. 2006), however the
mechanistical details are still unknown. Finally, the acetylation of 12 lysine residues
on HSF1 have been discovered to be important for the activation and attenuation of
the HSR (Westerheide et al. 2009; Raychaudhuri et al. 2014). For instance, acetylation
of individual lysine residues, lysine 208 and 298, during normal conditions have been
shown to stabilize HSF1 and protect it from being proteolytically degraded
(Raychaudhuri et al. 2014). In contrast, elevated HSF1 acetylation of lysine 80 and
lysine 118, which are located in the DBD, in response to heat shock have been shown
to result in attenuation of the HSR (Westerheide et al. 2009; Raychaudhuri et al. 2014),
which, as previously mentioned, is a consequence of HSF1-releasement from DNA.
The activity of HSF2 is mainly modulated by its level of expression. The expression
pattern of HSF2 is distinct depending on the type of tissue, type of cell, experienced
stress factors, and the phase of cell cycle (Sarge et al. 1994; Fiorenza et al. 1995;
Mathew et al. 1998; Elsing et al. 2014). Elevated HSF2 expression has been shown to
correlate with an induced DNA-binding activity, indicating that its activity is mainly
regulated by the level of its expression (Sarge et al. 1994; Mathew et al 1998).
However, HSF2 is also susceptible to PTMs, especially when predisposed to elevated
temperatures as it has been demonstrated that HSF2 is ubiquitylated by the E3ubiquityn ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), leading to
proteosomal degradation of HSF2 (Ahlskog et al. 2010). Furthermore, the expression
of HSF2 in testis is, in contrast, modulated at the mRNA level via microRNAs,
predominantly by microRNA-18 (miR-18) (Björk et al. 2010). miR-18 is expressed
cell type-specifically during spermatogenesis and functions to downregulate HSF2
expression by targeting the 3’UTR of HSF2 (Björk et al. 2010), demonstrating a
mechanism how HSF2 is modulated during development. In addition, HSF2 has also
been shown to be subjected to sumoylation. It was first suggested that the sumoylation
of certain lysine residues, especially lysine 82, located in the DBD of HSF2 would be
necessary in obtaining an efficient binding event between HSF2 and DNA upon HSR
(Goodson et al. 2001). However the impact of this modification was later contradicted
by multiple studies, reciprocating the perception that is currently acknowledged as an
inhibitory modification (Anckar et al. 2006; Tateishi et al. 2009; Feng et al. 2016).
Furthermore, mass-spectrometric analysis has recently identified 20 novel
sumoylation sites in the DBD and HR-A/B of HSF2 (Hendriks & Vertegaal, 2016),
23

Jenny Pessa

suggesting that the modulatory effect of PTMs might regulate HSF2 activity to a
greater extent than was originally anticipated.
2.7.4 Physiological impacts of HSFs
The classical model of HSFs modulating a cellular protective mechanism in response
to stress has been substantially expanded during the past decades. The importance of
these transcription factors has been signified in a large cohort of additional processes,
as they have been identified to function as important developmental factors, assist in
differentiation processes, and display critical roles upon several pathologies. The
physiological impact of HSFs in processes beyond the HSR was demonstrated over
30 years ago when the function of HSFs was shown to be vital for yeast cell survival
(Sorger & Pelham, 1988). Since then, studies have revealed that HSFs are of key
importance during e.g. developmental processes, as HSF1 was demonstrated to be
critical for the early stage development of Drosophila melanogaster larvae (Jedlicka
et al. 1997). Recently, HSF-1 was shown to be indispensable for C. elegans
development, demonstrating its function as an important developmental factor and
revealing that a set of key target genes important for nematode development are
different from the gene targets that HSF-1 displays under heat shock (Li et al. 2016).
Studies utilizing HSF knockout mice, HSF-null mice, have further demonstrated the
importance of HSFs during developmental processes. HSF-null mice are viable but
display certain phenotypic aberrations in sensory organs, the brain and in fertility
(Xiao et al. 1999; Inouye et al. 2004; Takaki et al. 2006; Uchida et al. 2011; Jin et al.
2011). For instance, HSF1-null mice display aberrations in the olfactory epithelium
due to an HSF1-dependent suppression of a cytokine important for olfactory
epithelium development called leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Metcalf, 2003;
Takaki et al. 2006). HSF1-null female mice have also been shown to suffer from
abnormal oocyte development (Christians et al. 2000) and prenatal lethality (Xiao et
al. 1999). In addition, HSF2-null mice display an impaired gametogenesis as female
mice fail to produce normal egg cells and male mice suffer from an elevated disruption
of spermatocytes (Kallio et al. 2002). In the brain, HSF2-null mice show aberrations
in the small hippocampus and they also display enlarged ventricles and misspositioned neurons (Kallio et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2006). The lack of both HSF1 and
HSF2 has been reported to cause male sterility in HSF1/2-null mice, suggesting an
24

Jenny Pessa

additive function in spermatogenesis when both HSFs are lost (Wang et al. 2004).
Also, the importance of HSF2 has been highlighted in neuronal migration as HSF1
and HSF2 were shown to form heterotrimers when exposed to alcohol, resulting in a
specific pattern of stress-inducible gene expression enhancing survival but impairing
the activity of genes involved in neuronal migration (El Fatimy et al. 2014).
The function of HSF4, on the other hand, has thus far only been identified in the
development of the lens (Fujimoto et al. 2004; Jin et al. 2011), where it displays a
critical function in promoting the transcription of genes encoding structural lens
proteins called crystallins (Somasundaram & Bhat, 2004; Shi et al. 2009; Roskamp et
al. 2019). HSF4-null mice characteristically display early lens deterioration followed
by cataract and blindness as a consequence of impaired lens epithelial cell
differentiation and proliferation (Fujimoto et al. 2004). Furthermore, HSF4 has also
been shown to be involved in olfactory neurogenesis. In this process, the expression
of LIF is modulated by HSF4 but unlike the function of HSF1, which suppresses LIF,
the modulatory role of HSF4 is reciprocal (Takaki et al. 2006). The mechanistical
functions and importance of the other identified human HSFs, HSF5, HSFX, and
HSFY, have not yet been elucidated humans. However, HSFX and HSFY have been
identified to be localized in X and Y sex chromosomes, respectively (Tessari et al.
2004; Fujimoto & Nakai, 2010). Whereas the human HSF5 has thus far been validated
only at the transcriptional level (Gomez-Pastor et al. 2018).
The diverse roles of HSFs have been identified in a large cohort of different biological
processes and the function of these transcription factors has also been linked to
multiple pathologies. HSFs are of high importance in brain development and brain
function via engagement in neuronal migration programs as well as neural synapse
maintenance (Homma et al. 2007; El Fatimy et al. 2014; Hooper et al. 2016; GomezPastor et al. 2018). The importance is supported by studies showing that impaired
HSF1-activity contributes to aging and neurodegeneration. Many neurodegenerative
diseases are associated with aggregation of misfolded proteins as a result of a
malfunctional protein quality-control machinery (Gomez-Pastor et al. 2018). The
advancement of the disease is lubricated by an impaired functionality of HSF1, which
itself does not cause the disease but contributes to the progression by contributing to
the decreased functionality of the protein quality-control machinery via reducing
chaperone expression. Whereas studies utilizing cell, fruit fly, and mice as
25

Jenny Pessa

neurodegenerative disease models have shown that the protein-folding capacity can
be rescued to some extent by inducing HSF1 expression, illustrating that HSF1
possesses therapeutic potential in diseases involved in neuronal degeneration (Neef et
al. 2011). Moreover, mounting evidence showing that HSFs might display critical
roles in several different forms of cancer have led to an increased interest towards this
research area. The association between HSFs and malignant transformation was also
of high importance in this thesis study, which is why I will proceed with discussing
this topic in more detail in the following section.
2.8 Heat shock factors in cancer
The development of cancer is modulated by major alterations in key processes that are
fundamental for cell survival such as signaling pathways modulating cellular
metabolism, development, motility, and stress responsiveness. Studies utilizing highresolution genome-wide sequencing have revealed the importance of HSFs in
regulating important transcriptional programs during various biological as well as
pathological conditions (Mendillo et al. 2012; Li et al. 2016). Some of these
transcriptional programs have been identified to operate in malignant transformation,
and linked to an altered HSP expression contributing to cancer progression.
The importance of HSF1 in cancer was demonstrated by two pioneering studies in
2007 (Dai et al. 2007; Min et al. 2007). Dai and co-workers were able to show that
HSF1-null mice experienced resistance towards induction of skin carcinogenesis and
tumorigenesis induced by mutant p53 (Dai et al. 2007). These findings were confirmed
by further studies demonstrating that a similar resistance of HSF1-null mice was
displayed also in response to the induction of liver and breast cancer (Jin et al. 2011;
Xi et al. 2012). The second pioneering study illustrated that the lack of HSF1 in p53null mice resulted in a decreased development of lymphomas, however the
development of carcinomas and sarcomas were instead increased (Min et al. 2007),
illustrating that the ablation of HSF1 results in a shift in the tumor development. This
observation was confirmed later by a study utilizing HSF4 and p53 double-knockout
mice, where the shift in tumor development was shown to be similar (Jin et al. 2012).
Considering that HSF1 is known to modulate chaperone expression, it is no surprise
that in cancer, where cells are predisposed to an increased amount of stress caused by
proteomic imbalance as a result of genomic instability, an increase in HSPs help to
26

Jenny Pessa

counteract the elevated metabolic burden (Liao et al. 2015; Kourtis et al. 2018).
Specific transcriptional networks modulated by HSF1 that contribute to malignant
transformation, have been demonstrated by two separate studies (Mendillo et al. 2012;
Scherz-Shouval et al. 2014). The first study reported of a specific transcriptional
program identified as the HSF1 cancer signature (HSF1-CaSig), providing a tool for
predicting cancer severity, as the HSF1-CaSig was demonstrated to correlate with the
disease outcome in breast cancer patients (Mendillo et al. 2012). The second study
illustrated the importance of HSF1 in reprogramming the tumor stroma of cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs) (Scherz-Shouval et al. 2014). CAFs consist of
reprogrammed normal tissue-derived fibroblast variants and myofibroblasts, and are
the most frequently existing cells in the tumor microenvironment. The high HSF1
expression observed in CAFs allows them to create a tumor-supporting
microenvironment by inducing the secretion of factors promoting cancer cell
proliferation and survival (Scherz-Shouval et al. 2014). HSF1 has been reported to
drive a non-cell-autonomous transcriptional program in CAFs, which is different from
the HSF1-CaSig program driven by the neighboring cancer cells, supporting
development of malignant transformation (Sahai et al. 2020). Similarly, HSF2 has
been shown to modulate cancer-involved gene regulatory networks (Björk et al. 2016;
Joutsen et al. 2020). Although no specific cancer signature has yet been discovered for
HSF2, its function as an important survival factor has been highlighted in a recent
study by Joutsen and co-workers, who reported that HSF2 preserves cell-cell
adhesions via cadherin expression upon proteasome inhibition (Joutsen et al. 2020).
Furthermore, the transcriptional program of HSF2 is also altered during prostate
cancer progression, where its expression has been reported to be decreased in response
to the development of the disease (Björk et al. 2016). Although HSF1 is the foremost
studied HSF also in the context of cancer, there is a number of studies indicating that
the expression of HSF2 and HSF4 can likewise be of key importance in malignant
transformation (Björk et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2019; Ma et al. 2020). To this date, a
plethora of studies have reported the involvement of HSFs in different forms of
cancers, and some of them are summarized in Table 1.

2.8.1 HSF1 in cancer
Several studies have characterized that an elevated HSF1 expression can contribute in
the progression of numerous types of cancers, as summarized in Table 1 and illustrated
in Figure 6 (Santagata et al. 2011). For instance in breast cancer, where HSF1 has been
shown to be frequently overexpressed, an oncogenic role of HSF1 has been
characterized in multiple studies (Citri et al. 2004; Xi et al. 2012; Yarden & Pines,
2012; Schulz et al. 2014; Carpenter et al. 2015; Asano et al. 2016; Yasuda et al. 2017;
Vydra et al. 2019; Guo et al. 2020). Breast cancer cells can roughly be divided into
three categories based on breast cancer marker expression: 1) luminal breast cancer
cell lines, which are characterized by the expression of progesterone receptors (PRs)
and estrogen receptors (ERs), 2) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
(HER2-positive) breast cancer cell lines, which are characterized by HER2-positivity
and ER-negativity, and 3) triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, where none of the
three markers are expressed. Studies have demonstrated, that in ERα-positive breast
cancer cells, ERα stimulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which in turn
induces the activation of HSF1. In this case, the activated MEK and ERK kinases
phosphorylate HSF1 on serine 326 (Vydra et al. 2019), which is one of the major socalled activating phosphorylation sites on HSF1 (Yasuda et al. 2017). This HSF1activating phosphorylation leads to overexpression of an HSP called HSP90/HSPC,
which is a chaperone promoting ERα maturation and the function of several kinases
that together drive tumor progression (Whitesell & Lindquist 2005; Xi et al. 2012).
Another important signaling axis in breast cancer is HER2, which expression is
increased in approximately 25% of cases and it has been shown to induce HSF1
expression, which can partly contribute to the metastatic features observed in this type
of cancer (Xi et al. 2012; Yarden & Pines, 2012). The activation of HSF1 in HER2positive breast cancer cells is also dependent on the phosphorylation of serine 326, in
this case by a kinase called alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) (Schulz et al.
2014; Carpenter et al. 2015), which is one of the key components of the
phosphoinositide

3-kinase

(PI3K)/AKT

signaling

pathway,

functioning

to

phosphorylate a plethora of target proteins including those involved in cell survival
and growth. Activated HSF1 induces the expression of several HSPs, including
HSP90/HSPC, and, importantly, also modulates the expression of one of the key
EMT-TFs, SNAI2, which in turn facilitates EMT and thus an enhanced cellular

29

Jenny Pessa

invasion capacity (Carpenter et al. 2015). A high HSP90/HSPC expression is
maintained by the HER-AKT-HSF1 signaling axis, which contributes to sustain the
functionality of mutated and overexpressed components, such as transcription factors
and kinases, supporting cancer cell survival. The cancer-supporting function of HSF1
has additionally been reported in other types of breast cancers and in several other
types of cancer, such as in lung (Scherz-Shouval et al. 2014; Cui et al. 2015), prostate
(Wang et al. 2004; Björk et al. 2018), and colorectal cancer among others (Jacobs &
Marnett, 2009; Li et al. 2017).
In prostate cancer, HSF1 overexpression has been demonstrated to contribute to
prostate carcinoma progression by causing polyploidy, which is a characteristic shown
to facilitate tumor progression (Wang et al. 2004; Davoli & de Lange, 2011). The
reduction of HSF1 expression has been reported to partially enable the regain of
diploidy in a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) (van Bokhoven et al. 2003). Furthermore,
Björk and co-workers recently suggested HSF1 as a predictive biomarker for prostate
cancer (Björk et al. 2018), as a high HSF1 mRNA expression was observed in clinical
prostate cancer samples in addition to a highly increased nuclear localization of HSF1
observed in patients with an advanced form of prostate cancer. Nuclear HSF1
localization also correlated with a high Gleason score, which is a system utilized to
characteristically grade prostate biopsies, and predisposed to a poor disease outcome
(Björk et al. 2018).

Figure 6. The tumor-supporting functions of HSF1. Mutated tumor suppressors and oncogenes
induce the expression of HSF1, which results in an increased transcription of multiple transcription
factors (TFs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs). Overexpression of these TFs and HSPs promote several
cancer-supporting features such as migration and metastasis, anti-apoptotic features, enhanced tumor
maintenance as well as improved proliferation. An increased HSF1 expression also promotes cancer
progression non-transcriptionally by inducing aneuploidy.

2.8.2 HSF2 in cancer
An accumulating amount of evidence have illustrated that HSF2 play an important
function in the development of several different types of malignancies. However in
contrast to HSF1, the expression of HSF2 has been shown to be downregulated in
some carcinomas, such as prostate cancer, while an increased HSF2 expression has
been observed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), low-grade gliomas,
and lung cancer (Mustafa et al. 2010; Björk et al. 2016; Zhong et al. 2016; Meng et al.
2017). To this date, HSF2 has been reported to display a dual role in cancer
progression, functioning as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and as an inducer in
others (Figure 7).
The role of HSF2 in breast cancer progression has recently been identified. HSF2 has
been shown to interact with one of the important EMT-TFs, ZEB1, and together
promote the expression of a microRNA cluster called miR-183/-96/-182 (Li et al.
2014). Each of these miRNAs have been shown to individually facilitate migration in
breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7 (Li et al. 2014). Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that miR-183 downregulates RAB21, a member of the small GTPase
family, resulting in aneuploidy which in turn has been linked to tumor evolution
(Sansregret & Swanton, 2017). HSF2 has also been reported to impact the expression
of an enzyme called ALG3, whose high expression has been demonstrated to induce
the proliferation rate and motility of MCF-7 cells (Yang et al. 2018). Additionally, a
positive feedback mechanism between HSF2 and ALG3 has been proposed, since the
ablation of ALG3 was shown to both halt the tumor progression and decrease the
expression of HSF2 when injected into nude mice (Yang et al. 2018).
A contradictory role of HSF2 has been proposed in prostate cancer, as the transcription
factor seems to operate as a tumor suppressor in this specific type of cancer (Björk et
al. 2016). A heterozygous loss of HSF2 as well as decreased HSF2 expression has
been correlated with a high Gleason score and hence with a poor patient survival, and
the expression of HSF2 in most prostate cancer tissues has been observed to be low.
The tumor-suppressing role of HSF2 in prostate cancer has been further supported by
a study where knockout of HSF2 in PC-3 cells was shown to enhance invasive growth
in 3D organotypic cultures and in vivo in a chorioallantoic membrane model (Björk et
al. 2016). Although mechanistical details driving the tumor-suppressive feature of
HSF2 in prostate cancer are still unclear, gene expression profiling has implied that
31

Jenny Pessa

the activity of GTPases, dynamics of cytoskeletal components, and cell-cell adhesions
are affected by HSF2, and these are all factors that are also altered in cancer cells
(Björk et al. 2016). The same study also demonstrated that downregulation of HSF2
in PC-3 cells displayed a stimulating effect on key EMT regulators, implying that there
is a connection between HSF2 and EMT. Furthermore, a meta-analysis indicated that
the mRNA expression of HSF2 was downregulated in several other cancer tissues in
addition to prostate cancer (Björk et al. 2016), signifying that a decreased expression
of HSF2 might be a key contributor in the progression of some cancers. This
emphasizes the need for further research in order to reveal the mechanistical details
driving the tumor-suppressive role of HSF2 in distinct types of cancers. HSF2 has
however been identified to display a function in several types of cancers, which are
summarized in Table 1.

Figure 7. The function of HSF2 in different types of cancers. Increased expression of HSF2 induces
the transcription (indicated by the green arrow) of several transcription factors (TFs), enzymes, and heat
shock proteins (HSPs), that via various mechanisms promote the acquisition of cancer-supporting
features and facilitate tumor progression in breast cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In prostate cancer, HSF2 expression affects the
activity of GTPases, reducing invasiveness and suppressing tumor progression.

2.8.3 HSF4 in cancer
The correlation between HSF4 and cancer have recently been discovered. Research
regarding HSF4 is still significantly lagging behind that of HSF2 and especially HSF1,
but there is a growing interest towards elucidating the role of this transcription factor
in the context of cancer. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, HSF4 has, in addition to HSF2,
been suggested to modulate the level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-aplha (HIF-1α)
expression (Chen et al. 2011). HIF-1α is a transcriptional regulator of hypoxia,
stimulating the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response
to low oxygen levels, which in turn facilitates angiogenesis (Forsythe et al. 1996).
Cancer cells require an induced amount of oxygen, provided by blood vessels, to keep
up with their rapid growth, and blood vessel formation is also required in order to
enable metastasis (Nishida et al. 2006). In these cells, both overexpression and
knockout of HSF4 and HSF2 induced the expression of HIF-1α and therefore also the
expression of VEGF, suggesting that the maintenance of HIF-1α expression is
modulated by these HSFs. The possible modulatory effect of HSF4 on HIF-1α
indicates that HSF4 might display an important role in breast cancer progression by
promoting tumor survival and growth as well as by supporting cancer metastasis, if
not individually at least in cooperation with HSF2. However, whether HSF4 displays
a direct role in the progression of breast cancer remains to be elucidated. Furthermore,
HSF4 has also been shown to be overexpressed in primary hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) tissues (Ma et al. 2020). The abnormally elevated expression of HSF4 was
correlated with a poor HCC patient survival. Also similarly to its proposed modulatory
effect in breast cancer (Chen et al. 2011), it was shown that HSF4 could stimulate
cancer progression by promoting EMT via HIF-1α-based induction of AKT in Huh-7
and SMMC-7721 cells (Ma et al. 2020), indicating that HCC cells might be able to
exploit the HIF-1α-stimulating function of HSF4 to enable cancer progression.
Evidence supporting that HSF4 might exhibit a key role in colorectal cancer has been
recently reported in a study where frequent HSF4 expression was observed in
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (Yang et al. 2017). This finding demonstrated the
potential clinical relevance of HSF4 in cancer for the first time, showing that HSF4
expression correlated with cancer progression and poor patient survival (Yang et al.
2017). In addition, analysis utilizing bioinformatics tools have indicated that HSF4
might interact with a phosphatase called DUSP26, which has in previous studies been
33

Jenny Pessa

shown to decrease the activity of HSF4 by regulating its phosphorylation status (Hu
& Mivechi, 2006). Although a correlation between HSF4 and colorectal cancer has
now been demonstrated, the mechanistical function of HSF4 in CRC remains to be
elucidated.

3 Research Aims
Several cellular processes contribute to cancer progression, one of which is epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a program responsible for regulating cellular motility.
EMT plays a major role in the evolution of cancer as it enables the development of
invasive traits that facilitate metastasis. The transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)
signaling pathway is among the most prominent pathways inducing EMT. The
crosstalk between distinct pathways is of high importance in both normal and
transformed cells. Another pathway which has recently been linked to cancer is the
heat shock response (HSR), which is regulated by heat shock factors (HSFs), and an
abnormal expression of these transcription factors have frequently been associated
with malignant transformation. Previous research has indicated that HSF2 is involved
in regulating EMT in prostate cancer cells (Björk et al. 2016), and unpublished results
from the Sistonen laboratory have suggested that the TGFβ signaling pathway
modulates HSF2 expression. However, it remains unknown how this downregulation
is achieved and whether it has any physiological impact on cancer cells in EMT. Based
on these findings, my main research aims were to first determine which part of the
HSF2 promoter modulates the expression of HSF2 during EMT, second elucidate
whether HSF2 affects the cellular invasion capacity during EMT, and third determine
if HSF1 impacts HSF2 expression during EMT. For the first aim, I generated plasmids
where luciferase gene expression was driven by different sizes and regions of the
HSF2 promoter, enabling quantification of the transcriptional activity utilizing
luciferase reporter assay. For the second aim, I overexpressed exogenous HSF2 in
breast cancer cells and assessed the invasion capacity of cells under control conditions
and upon EMT stimuli using wound healing assays. For the final aim, I generated cells
where the expression of endogenous HSF1 was downregulated, and western blot was
subsequently used to assess the level of HSF2 protein expression in these cells under
control conditions and upon EMT stimuli.
The main research aims in this thesis study were to:
1. Determine which part of the HSF2 promoter regulates HSF2 gene expression
during EMT
2. Determine whether HSF2 impacts the cellular invasion capacity during EMT
3. Determine if HSF1 modulates the expression of HSF2 during EMT

4 Materials & Methods
4.1 Cell lines
A transformed breast epithelial cell line, MDA-MB-231, was used as a model system
in this experiment. MDA-MB-231 cells are isolated from a metastatic site in pleural
effusion and are extensively used in research associated with studying the underlying
mechanisms of EMT, hence the choice of these specific cell line. For culturing MDAMB-231 cells Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Biowest) was
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest), 2.5 mM glutamine
(Biowest), 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/µl streptomycin. The cells were cultured at
37 °C and 5% CO2.
4.2 Treatments
With the purpose of inducing EMT, the culture medium for each cell line was switched
to an assay medium. The assay media differed from the culture media in that no
penicillin or streptomycin was added, and they were supplemented with 2% serum
instead of 5%. In order to activate EMT, cells were treated with TGFβ-1 or StemXvivo
(XV), which have previously been established in numerous studies to induce EMT in
these cell lines. Thus, cells were treated with assay medium supplemented with either
10 ng/ml of TGFβ-1 or 10 µl/ml of XV, and control cells were treated with assay
medium lacking the EMT-inducing supplement. The TGFβ-1 or XV treatment lasted
either 4 or 24 h, after which the cells were harvested.
4.3 Harvest and lysis of cells
Following treatments, cells were harvested and lysed. The cells that were used for
luciferase assay were first washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Biowest)
and then harvested by scraping using PBS. The cell suspensions were centrifuged and
the resulting supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellets were then lysed using a
commercial reagent, Passive lysis buffer (Promega). A dilution of the buffer was
prepared from 5x Passive lysis buffer by adding MQ-H2O to obtain a 1x final
concentration. The pellets were resuspended in 40 µl of 1x Passive lysis buffer and
incubated on ice for 10 min. Finally, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rcf for
2 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were transferred into new tubes.

36

Jenny Pessa

Cells that were used for western blot analysis were washed with PBS and then
harvested by scraping using 3x Laemmlie lysis buffer (see recipe attachment).
Laemmlie lysis buffer contains e.g. β-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), which denatures proteins by breaking disulfide bonds, and disrupts the tertiary
folding pattern reverting the proteins to a linearized form, respectively. The cell lysates
were then boiled for 10 min, to further support the denaturing process of proteins, and
stored at 4 °C until further usage.
4.4 Transfection
Transfection is a method that can be used to achieve expression of a desired protein
by introducing exogenous DNA into a cell. The transfection technique utilized in my
study was electroporation, where short pulses of an electric field is used to obtain a
transient permeability of the cell membrane, thus enabling the transfer of plasmids into
the cell (Neumann et al. 1982).
For transfecting cells with specific plasmids, NeonTM Transfection System (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and the associated 100 µl transfection kit was utilized. For each
round of transfection, 2.2 million cells were resuspended in R buffer and 15 µg
plasmid was added to the cell suspension. Next, transfection was performed using the
100 µl pipet provided by the kit, which was placed in the transfection cuvette
containing 3 ml E2 buffer. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected according to the
setups indicated in Table 2. Transfected cells were plated on new cell culture plates
and let to recover for 48 h after which they were treated with TGFβ-1 or StemXvivo
to induce EMT.

4.4.1 Transfection of cells for luciferase reporter assay
In order to elucidate which part of the HSF2 promoter is responsible for regulating
HSF2 gene expression during EMT, luciferase reporter assay was used. For this
purpose, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with plasmids where different regions
of the HSF2 promoter was driving the expression of a luciferase gene (Figure 12A).
In addition, two positive controls were generated for these experiments by transfecting
cells with plasmids where a SNAI2 or an MMP9 promoter was driving the expression
of the luciferase gene (Figure 12A). These promoters were selected since the
expression of their corresponding genes are known to be induced upon EMT. An
additional control was obtained by transfecting cells with an empty pSTARR plasmid
containing the luciferase gene. Furthermore, each transfection was accompanied by a
co-transfection of 5 µg β-galactosidase plasmid to enable β-galactosidase activity
measurement and allow normalization of transfection efficiency for the luciferase
reporter assay. In β-galactosidase plasmids, a ubiquitously active viral promoter is
driving the expression of an E. coli lacZ gene, which allows quantification of βgalactosidase in transfected cells and the use of it as an internal control for
normalization.
4.4.2 Transfection of cells for wound healing assays
In order to determine whether HSF2 impacts the cellular invasion capacity during
EMT, the wound healing assay method was used. For this assay, I needed to generate
cells that continuously overexpress exogenous HSF2, even upon active EMT. Hence,
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with plasmids where the gene expression of
HSF2 and GFP was driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This construct also
contained a Thosea asigna virus 2A self-cleaving peptide (T2A) sequence between
the two genes to allow ribosomal skipping and, thus, the production of two distinct
proteins instead of one fusion protein. The CMV-HSF2-T2A-GFP plasmid had been
generated prior to this experiment. In order to generate a control for the wound healing
assay, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP (pEGFP-N2). Cells
expressing GFP plasmids maintain a basal level of endogenous HSF2 expression,
which can be affected by stimulating EMT, thus functioning as control in the assay.

4.4.3 Transfection of cells for western blot analysis
To study whether HSF1 modulates the downregulation of HSF2 gene expression
during EMT, western blot analysis was utilized. For this purpose, I needed to generate
cells where the gene expression of endogenous HSF1 was downregulated. In order to
achieve this, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding an shRNA
molecule targeting HSF1 (shHSF1).
Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are a commonly used technique of RNA interference
(RNAi) to knock-down the production of a specific endogenous protein. In the cytosol,
the shRNA is first processed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) by an enzyme called
Dicer, enabling its binding to the target mRNA through complementary base pairing.
The degradation of target mRNA is achieved via an enzymatic pathway involving the
endogenous RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which exploits the siRNA to
recognize and bind to the target mRNA, and the protein Argonaute (Ago), which is
responsible for the cleavage event initiating the degradation process (Elbashir et al.
2001).
Additionally, a control for the western blot analysis was generated by transfecting cells
with plasmids encoding a so called scrambled control (Scr) shRNA molecule. A
scrambled control contains randomly rearranged siRNA or shRNA sequences, and
will induce the RNAi pathway, however the sequence is designed in such manner that
it should not target any specific mRNA sequence.
4.5 In-fusion cloning
In-fusion cloning is a method to introduce a desired DNA sequence into a vector. The
method relies on the use of a plasmid vector, which is linearized at a specific target
site and utilizes a commercial kit containing In-Fusion Enzyme to incorporate a
desired DNA fragment at this target site. The vector is linearized and amplified in a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using forward and reverse primers (Figure 8: A).
PCR is a method to exponentially amplify a desired DNA sequence and it relies on
thermal cycling which involves repeated rounds of heating and cooling. The DNA
helix is denatured during the heating step, which enables primer-binding to the
complementary sequences when the temperature is lowered. These primers function
as starting points for DNA polymerase to begin complementary strand synthesis, thus
generating a copy of the original DNA strand. A linearized plasmid vector is obtained
39

Jenny Pessa

during PCR amplification as the DNA polymerase uses the specific forward and
reverse primers as starting points for strand elongation, leaving a nick between the
back ends of the primers, thus resulting the production of a linear DNA strand (Figure
8A). The insert fragment is also amplified with PCR using forward and reverse
primers, but the primers used for this PCR reaction have 15-base pair (bp) overhangs
that are complementary to the ends of the linearized vector (Figure 8B). Thus, when
the linearized vector, amplified fragment of interest, and 5x In-Fusion HD Enzyme
Premix (Takara Bio) are mixed together in an in-fusion cloning reaction, the fragment
will be incorporated into the vector via homologous recombination events that occur
between the complementary sequences (Figure 8C).

Jenny Pessa

Figure 8. Schematic of the basic steps in in-fusion cloning. A) The in-fusion cloning technique is
based on the use of a linearized vector, which is obtained via a PCR reaction. In this reaction, forward
and reverse primers (black arrows) are used that amplify the vector and linearize it at the desired
insertion site. The site where the vector is linearized (indicated as black lines in the linearized vector)
is used in the following steps and will ultimately function as the site of fragment insertion. B) The
fragment of interest is amplified from DNA in a PCR reaction also by using forward and reverse
primers. However, these primers are unique in the sense that they contain specifically designed 15-base
pair (bp) overhangs (indicated as red arrows), that are fundamental for the subsequent in-fusion reaction
step. C) The final step in the in-fusion cloning technique is the in-fusion cloning reaction, where the
amplified fragment, containing the 15-bp overhangs, and the linearized vector are mixed in an in-fusion
cloning reaction together with 5x In-Fusion HD Enzyme Premix (Takara Bio). In this reaction, the
fragment is incorporated into the vector through homologous recombination (HR) events that take place
between the complementary sequences displayed by the fragment overhangs and the ends of the
linearized vector.

In-fusion cloning was used to generate reporter constructs that enabled me to
determine which part of the HSF2 promoter is accountable for suppressing HSF2 gene
expression during EMT. For this purpose, two plasmids were generated where the
gene expression of luciferase was driven either by a 2.5 kb HSF2 promoter region
containing the 5’UTR of HSF2 (pHSF2-2.5kb), or a 1 kb HSF2 promoter region
lacking the 5’UTR of HSF2 (pHSF2-1kb-(∆5’UTR)). Additionally, in-fusion cloning
was also used to generate two control plasmids, where the gene expression of
luciferase was driven either by a SNAI2 promoter (pSNAI2) or an MMP9 promoter
(pMMP9). These promoters were selected based on the known EMT-induced function
of their corresponding genes, therefore they function as positive controls when
assessing induction of EMT.
4.5.1 In-fusion cloning reaction
The first step in the in-fusion cloning technique was to linearize the vector at the
desired fragment insertion site. For this purpose, a plasmid containing a luciferase
gene, STARR-seq luciferase validation vector_ORI_empty (#99297, AddGene), was
used in a PCR reaction with primers indicated in Table 3. These forward and reverse
primers were designed using SnapGene software to linearize the vector at the desired
site upstream of the luciferase gene.

Polymerase (New England BioLabs) were mixed together. RNase-free H2O was used
to adjust the reaction volume to 25 µl. The reaction mixture was then placed in a PCR
machine and a PCR reaction was performed according to the settings indicated in

Following the PCR reaction, the linearized vector was separated on a 1 % agarose gel
(see recipe attachment), which was prepared by mixing 0.4 g agarose with 40 ml 1x
Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (see recipe attachment), and 2 µl MidoriGreen
(NIPPON Genetics). The prepared agarose gel was placed in an electrophoresis
machine and 1x TBE was applied to the machine chamber. The TBE buffer contains
EDTA, which is a chelator of divalent cations, hence inactivating many nucleases that
rely on the use of divalent cations for their function, thereby protecting DNA from
being enzymatically degraded. Borate induces the buffering capacity of TBE, and
since Tris is a base, the combination of borate and Tris maintains a nearly neutral pH
in the buffer keeping DNA deprotonated and soluble in water. Additionally,
MidoriGreen is a non-carcinogenic alternative to the traditionally used ethidium
bromide, and it is added to the gel solution in order to visualize the DNA with UV
light. Next, 5 µl 6x DNA Gel Loading Dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 0.4 µl
glycerol were added to the PCR reaction product. The DNA Gel Loading Dye contains
two dyes that enable visual tracking of DNA migration, and EDTA, which protect
DNA against enzymatic degradation. The addition of glycerol makes the sample
heavier and ensures that the sample DNA forms a layer at the bottom of the well. A
GeneRuler 1 kb DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific), also supplemented with 6x
DNA Gel Loading Dye and glycerol, was added in the first well of the agarose gel to
allow size estimation of the amplified DNA product, and the linearized vector sample
was pipetted into the following well. An electric field of 70 V was applied on the gel
for 40 min to enable separation of DNA. The phosphate backbone of DNA is
negatively charged and will therefore result in the migration of DNA fragments
towards the positively charged anode when an electric field is applied. Since DNA has
a uniform mass-to-charge ratio the separation is based on size, however several factors
affect the rate of migration including e.g. agarose concentration, conformation of
43

Jenny Pessa

DNA, applied voltage, and used electrophoresis buffer. The agarose polymer contains
negatively charged sulphate and pyruvate groups. These functional groups enable a
process called electroendosmosis in which a flow of water in the opposite direction of
DNA movement is generated, dampening the movement of DNA fragments and
resulting in the blurring of bands. Next, bands of correct sizes were excised from the
gel and the DNA was purified by a commercial kit, PureLink Quick Gel Extraction
and PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen).
To purify DNA from the gel, 900 µl of Gel Solubilization Buffer (L3) was first added
to the tube containing the excised gel and incubated at 50 °C at least 10 min until the
gel slice had dissolved. The tube was inverted a few times during the incubation to
accelerate the dissolving process. Next, 300 µl of isopropanol was added to the
dissolved gel and the solution was mixed thoroughly. The solution was then pipetted
onto a column inside a wash tube and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 1 min. The flowthrough was discarded and the column was next washed by adding 500 µl Wash Buffer
(W1) and centrifuging at 12,000 x g for 1 min. The wash buffer contains ethanol,
which washes salts and impurities away while the DNA remains in the column. The
flow-through was again discarded and the columns were then moved to new tubes and
dried by an additional centrifugation at maximum speed for 3 min. Subsequently, the
column was placed in a new eppendorf tube and 30 µl RNase-free H2O was added to
the column followed by a 5-minute incubation at RT and a centrifugation at 12,000 x
g for 1 min to elute the DNA. Finally, the DNA concentration was measured using the
NanoDrop machine and the purified DNA was stored at 4 °C.
The next step in the in-fusion cloning technique was to amplify the desired promoter
DNA fragment (Figure 12A: pHSF2-2.5kb, pHSF2-1kb-(∆5’UTR), pSNAI2, and
pMMP9) and generate 15-bp overhangs that were complementary to the linearized
pSTARR-luciferase vector. In order to achieve this, a larger DNA region,
approximately 3-5 kb, containing the desired promoter and the surrounding sequence
area, was first amplified from genomic DNA isolated from human embryonic kidney
293 (HEK 293) cells in a PCR reaction (Figure 9). It was necessary to first amplify
and purify a larger promoter region as the 15-bp overhang primers would result in
several amplification products, if used directly in a PCR reaction with genomic DNA.
One PCR reaction was made for HSF2, another for SNAI2, and a third for MMP9.
The PCR reaction mixtures were prepared similarly as described for the reaction where
44

Jenny Pessa

the vector was linearized, however HEK 293 genomic DNA was used as template
DNA in these reactions, and distinct forward and reverse primers were used for
respective reaction (Table 5). The PCR reactions were performed according to the
thermocycling conditions indicated in Table 4. The PCR products from these reactions
were separated on an agarose gel, excised, and the DNA fragments were purified as
described earlier.

Figure 9. Amplification of 3-5 kb promoter region from HEK 293 genomic DNA. Promoter regions
(light green), containing the desired promoter fragment (blue) and the surrounding sequence areas, were
first amplified from genomic DNA isolated from HEK 293 cells (grey). This was achieved by a PCR
reaction using forward (red) and reverse (turquoise) primers, that were designed to amplify the sequence
between them, resulting in a PCR product of the promoter region approximately 3 to 5 kb in size.

The obtained purified DNA containing a 3-5 kb promoter region of HSF2, SNAI2, and
MMP9 were next used for another PCR reaction. The purpose of this reaction was to
amplify the specific promoter fragment and generate the 15-bp overhangs (Figure 10),
which were required for the homologous recombination to succeed. For this purpose,
forward and reverse primers, containing overhangs complementary to the ends of the
linearized pSTARR-luciferase vector, were designed using SnapGene software (Table
6). Next, separate PCR reactions were performed to obtain the specific fragments for
2.5 kb of the HSF2 promoter (HSF2-2.5kb), 1 kb of the HSF2 promoter (HSF-1kb(∆5’UTR)), the SNAI2 promoter, and the MMP9 promoter. These reactions were done
similarly as the reaction that linearized the vector, using the respective purified 3-5 kb
promoter region DNA as a template. The PCR products from each of the four reactions
were separated on an agarose gel, excised, and the DNA purified as described
previously. Each purified promoter fragment with overhangs and the linearized
pSTARR-luciferase vector were next used in an in-fusion cloning reaction.

Figure 10. Amplification of promoter fragment and generation of overhangs. In order to obtain the
specific promoter fragment from the previously amplified 3-5 kb promoter region, forward and reverse
primers were designed to specifically amplify the promoter fragment of interest (blue). Additionally,
these primers displayed a unique feature as they also contained 15-bp overhangs, which were designed
to be complementary to the ends of the linearized vector. Thus, the resulting PCR product contained
the amplified promoter fragment of interest with overhangs at its 5’ and 3’ ends.

The final step in the in-fusion cloning technique was to perform the in-fusion cloning
reaction with the amplified and purified linear pSTARR-luciferase vector and each of
the generated promoter fragments with overhangs (HSF2-2.5kb, HSF-1kb-(∆5’UTR),
SNAI2, and MMP9). During this reaction, the promoter fragment will be incorporated
into the linearized vector via homologous recombination that occur between the
complementary sequences of the fragment overhangs and the ends of the linearized
vector, as depicted in Figure 8: C. In each reaction 5 ng of the linearized pSTARRluciferase vector, 1 ng of the promoter fragment, and 0.5 µl of 5x In-Fusion HD
Enzyme Premix (Takara Bio) were mixed. RNase-free H2O was added to the mixture
to adjust the reaction volume to 2.5 µl. Next, the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for
15 min, whereafter each construct was separated on a 1% agarose gel to verify
construct size, and then transformed into bacteria.
4.5.2 Bacterial Transformation
Plasmids generated through the in-fusion cloning reaction were next transformed into
Escherichia coli (E. coli) Stellar Competent cells (Takara Bio) with the purpose of

47

Jenny Pessa

creating bacterial colonies expressing each plasmid. This E. coli strain lacks the gene
cluster that cuts methylated DNA and, additionally, possesses a highly efficient
transformation capacity, making it specifically useful for cloning purposes. Stellar
competent cells were first thawed on ice. Next, 1-2 µl of in-fusion cloning product was
pipetted into 30 µl of bacteria and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The
incubation was followed by a 45-second heat shock at 42 °C, to increase cell
membrane permeability and allow entry of DNA into the cells. Next, cells were
incubated on ice for 2 min to allow the membrane to restore, before the addition of
400 µl of Super Optimal Broth with Catabolite repression (SOC) medium, which is a
nutritional medium used to further support the recovery of the cells. The mixture was
then incubated on a shaker at 37 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, 200 µl of LB medium
was added, and 300 µl of the mixture was spread out on a prewarmed agar plate
containing ampicillin. The agar plate was then incubated at 37 °C overnight. Finally,
grown bacterial colonies were selected for subculturing and plasmids were isolated for
sequencing, which was required to confirm that each fragment had been incorporated
appropriately into the vector.
4.5.3 Site-directed mutagenesis
Following sequencing of the generated plasmids, three point mutations were observed
in the promoter region of the pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid. These mutations were corrected
using site-directed mutagenesis in which specific primers for each mutated site were
made. These primers were complementary to the HSF2 promoter sequence except for
the correcting one-nucleotide-change at the site of mutation (Figure 11A). The primers
hybridize to the complementary sequence of HSF2-2.5kb during PCR, where a special
type of DNA polymerase, PfuTurbo, is used. PfuTurbo DNA polymerase replicates
the plasmid strands without displacing the primers, hence the primers containing the
correcting mutations will remain intact in the newly synthesized vector (Figure 11B).
The PCR reaction linearizes the plasmids by leaving gaps on the back-side of the
primers, resulting in so-called nicked circular strands (Figure 11B). The non-mutated
parental DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme that specifically targets methylated
DNA, and since the newly synthesized nicked circular strands are unmethylated, they
are resistant against this degradation. In the final step of site-directed mutagenesis, the
nicked circular strands are transformed into competent bacterial cells, which are able
to repair the nicks during replication and re-establish circular plasmids (Figure 11B).
48

Jenny Pessa

Figure 11. The principle of site-directed mutagenesis. A) The plasmid DNA (blue) contains a
mutated nucleotide (black cross) in its sequence. The forward primer used in a site-directed mutagenesis
reaction binds to the plasmid DNA as it displays otherwise a fully complementary sequence to the
plasmid DNA, expect for the one nucleotide that is the correcting mutation (red cross). For simplicity,
only the forward primer is indicated in this figure. B) 1) A PCR reaction is performed with parental
DNA template (blue) containing the site of mutation (indicated as black crosses), oligonucleotide
primers (orange and green) introducing the correcting mutation (indicated as red crosses), and highfidelity PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. During the temperature cycling in PCR, the DNA template is
denatured and oligonucleotide primers are allowed to anneal to the template. PfuTurbo DNA
polymerase extends and incorporates the oligonucleotide primers, without displacing the primers,
resulting in nicked circular DNA containing the correcting mutation. 2) The hemimethylated and
methylated parental DNA is digested with DpnI restriction enzyme, which specifically targets
methylated DNA, thus the newly synthesized nicked circular DNA is protected against its enzymatic
degradation. 3) In the final step of site-directed mutagenesis, the nicked circular DNA is transformed
into competent bacterial cells that are able to repair the nicks, resulting in an intact, fully functional
plasmid.

The mutagenesis primers were designed, using SnapGene and Primer-BLAST
software, so that both the forward and reverse primers for each of the three mutations
contained the desired mutation site in the middle region of the approximately 30
nucleotides long primer. The Tm value for mutagenesis primers was approximately 70
°C. The mutagenesis reaction was done by employing the QuickChange XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies). In the sample reaction, 15 ng of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template was mixed with 2.5 µl of 10x reaction
buffer, 0.75 µl (10 µM) of each forward and reverse mutagenesis primer (Table 8), 0.5
µl of dNTP mix, 1.5 µl of QuickSolution, and RNase-free H2O to achieve a total
reaction volume of 25 µl. Finally, 0.5 µl (2.5 U/µl) of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was
added prior to initiation of thermal cycling. PfuTurbo DNA polymerase is a
combination of Pfu DNA polymerase and thermostable ArchaeMaxx polymeraseenhancing factor, and it enables amplification of complex target DNA in a high yield,
without displacing the mutant oligonucleotide primers, and with a low error rate. A
PCR reaction was then performed as indicated in Table 7.

Following PCR reaction, 0.5 µl (10 U/ µl) of DpnI restriction enzyme (Agilent) was
added to the reaction product in order to cleave methylated DNA lacking the corrected
mutations, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. DpnI is a type IIM restriction enzyme
that specifically cleaves methylated or hemimethylated adenine at its GATC
recognition sequence in DNA. Since the newly synthesized PCR-amplified DNA,
containing the corrected mutation, is unmethylated, it is resistant against DpnI,
whereas the parental DNA lacking the correction is methylated and is thereby prone
to digestion by the enzyme. Subsequently, the site-directed mutagenesis reaction
product was sequenced to verify whether the mutation had been successfully
corrected. A similar procedure was carried out to revise each observed mutation in the
50

Jenny Pessa

HSF2-2.5kb promoter region. Finally, the vector containing the corrected mutations
in the HSF2-2.5kb promoter fragment, was then transformed into bacteria as
previously described.

4.5.4 Plasmid shortening
In order to generate additional plasmids containing either a 2 kb, 1 kb, or 0.5 kb region
or just the 5’UTR of the HSF2 promoter (Figure 12A: pHSF2-2kb, pHSF2-1kb,
pHSF2-0.5kb, and pHSF2-5’UTR), the previously generated pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid
was shortened using a three-step process that involved linearization of the circular
plasmid, phosphorylation of the 5’ DNA ends, and ligation in order to re-establish a
circular plasmid. In the first step, the pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid was linearized in four
separate PCR reactions, which were performed similarly as previously described for
the vector linearization reaction, using distinct forward and reverse primers to generate
a shortened version of the pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid (Table 9). Each of these primers were
designed to linearize the pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid at a specific site so that when the DNA
polymerase elongated the plasmid DNA during PCR, a desired region of the HSF2
promoter was excluded (Figure 12B). The PCR products from each of the four
reactions were then separated on an agarose gel, excised, and the DNA was purified
as described previously.

51

Jenny Pessa

Figure 12. The constructs generated for luciferase reporter assay and the mechanism of plasmid
shortening. A) Each promoter, SNAI2, MMP9, and HSF2, were cloned into the vector upstream of a
luciferase gene. The designated nomenclature of constructs is indicated on the right (∆ indicates the
removed fragment). Six different constructs containing a region of the HSF2 promoter were generated.
The black line between the promoter region and the UTR or the luciferase gene, respectively, indicates
that a fragment was deleted from this position. B) In the plasmid shortening approach, the pHSF2-2.5kb
plasmid was first linearized in a PCR reaction using forward and reverse primers (black arrows), which
were designed to exclude a specific region from the promoter. After a PCR reaction, a linearized
plasmid is obtained that lacks a specific region of the HSF2 promoter. Subsequent phosphorylation of
the ends of the linearized plasmid followed by a ligation reaction reseals the plasmid generating a
construct that contains a shorter region of the HSF2 promoter. This figure illustrates the generation of
pHSF2-1kb from the pHSF2-2.5kb plasmid via plasmid shortening.

In the second step, the 5’ end of the linearized plasmid DNA is phosphorylated to
obtain a 5’ phosphate, which is required for the subsequent ligation to be successful.
The DNA 5’ end phosphorylation is achieved by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (T4 PNK,
New England BioLabs), which is an enzyme that catalyzes both the transfer and
exchange of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from ATP to the 5’ end of DNA (Figure 13), and
removes phosphoryl groups from the 3’ end of DNA. The DNA 5’ end
phosphorylation enables ligation and resealing of the plasmid in the third step, which
relies on the use of T4 DNA Ligase (New England BioLabs). T4 DNA Ligase is an
enzyme that catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation between juxtaposed 5’
phosphate and 3’ hydroxyl ends in double-stranded DNA (Figure 13), that is, between
the phosphorylated ends of the linearized vector.
52

Jenny Pessa

Figure 13. DNA 5’ end phosphorylation and phosphodiester bond formation during ligation. In
the first reaction, T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK) catalyzes the transfer and exchange of inorganic
phosphate from ATP to the free 5’ hydroxyl end of DNA, resulting in phosphorylation of the 5’end of
DNA and the generation of ATP. In the second reaction, T4 DNA ligase catalyzes phosphodiester bond
formation between the two DNA molecules. The enzymes requires ATP as a cofactor in the reaction
where two ATP molecules are consumed to form two AMP molecules and a single phosphodiester
bond. The phosphodiester bond is formed between the 3’ hydroxyl group of the acceptor and the 5’
phosphate group of the donor.

To establish the 5’ end phosphorylation of the four newly linearized plasmids, 15 ng
of each purified fragment DNA was mixed in a separate reaction with a commercial
kit of 10x T4 PNK Buffer (New England BioLabs), 1 mM ATP, 10 U (units) T4 PNK
enzyme (New England BioLabs), and RNase-free H2O to adjust reaction volume to 25
µl. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h followed by a 10-minute heatinactivation at 75 °C to inactivate the enzyme. Next, the linearized vectors containing
the phosphorylated ends were used in four different ligation reactions. In these
reactions, 15 ng of linearized vector was mixed with Quick Ligase Reaction Buffer
(2x), 0.5 µl of Quick T4 DNA Ligase (New England BioLabs), and RNase-free H2O
to adjust reaction volume to 25 µl. Finally, the reaction mixtures were incubated at RT
overnight and the reaction products were separated on a 1% agarose gel to verify that
each shortened plasmid was of correct size. Each plasmid was subsequently used to
transform bacteria as previously described.
4.6 Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase assay is a method applied to indirectly measure gene transcription. It is a
widely used technique due to its relatively low cost, high sensitivity, as well as a
simple and fast mode of action. The assay is based on the use of a plasmid, which
contains a promoter sequence that drives the expression of a luciferase gene. The
luciferase gene is originated from Phoinus phyralis, more commonly known as the
firefly. This gene encodes for a 61 kDa enzyme that functions to oxidize its substrate,
D-luciferin, when Mg2+, O2, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are accessible (Figure
14). In principle, the luciferase enzyme catalyzes D-luciferin oxidation through a
chemical energy conversion powered by electron transition, leading to the production
of oxyluciferin and quantitatively measurable fluorescent light (Brasier & Ron, 1992;
Fan & Wood, 2007). Hence, by quantifying the amount of produced luciferase, the
level of target gene transcription can indirectly be measured. In addition, another
reporter assay, β-galactosidase, is traditionally used to normalize the transfection
efficiency in the luciferase reporter assay system.

Jenny Pessa

Figure 14. Schematic illustration of the luciferase reporter assay.
A genetic regulatory element, called a promoter, (blue) is placed upstream of a luciferase gene in a
plasmid and the construct is transfected into cells. The promoter will determine to what extent the
luciferase gene is expressed. Transcription of the luciferase gene results in the production of luciferase
mRNA, which is subsequently translated into luciferase enzyme. The produced luciferase enzyme
oxidizes its substrate, D-luciferin, in an in vitro reaction when Mg2+, O2, and ATP are present. This
oxidation reaction results in the production of fluorescent light, which can be detected using a
luminometer. The measured fluorescence is then analyzed and used to quantify the amount of luciferase,
which is in a direct proportion to the promoter activity, thus enabling indirect assessment of target gene
transcription. TFs = Transcription factors. (Figure modified from ThermoFisher Scientific User
Manual).

Previous results from Professor Lea Sistonen’s laboratory have indicated that HSF2 is
downregulated on the transcriptional level. Owing to this discovery, one of the main
goals of this thesis was to determine which part of the HSF2 promoter is responsible
for regulating HSF2 gene expression during EMT. Thus, it was necessary for me to
utilize the luciferase reporter assay in order to indirectly assess the level of HSF2
transcription. Hence, with the aim of identifying the specific HSF2 promoter region
accountable for controlling HSF2 gene expression upon active EMT, multiple
constructs were generated, each containing a variously sized portion of the HSF2
promoter sequence placed upstream of the luciferase gene. In addition, two positive
controls were generated for this experiment, where either an SNAI2 promoter or an
55

Jenny Pessa

MMP9 promoter was driving the expression of the luciferase gene. These promoters
were selected since their corresponding genes are known to be upregulated during
EMT. Furthermore, an additional control, an empty pSTARR vector containing the
luciferase gene, was also used in this experiment.
Thus, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing pSTARRluciferase, pSNAI2, pMMP9, or one of the pHSF2-luciferase gene constructs. The 48hour recovery was followed by a 4-hour or a 24-hour TGFβ-1 treatment, and the
luciferase signal was measured for each sample under control conditions and upon
EMT stimuli.
4.6.1 Measurement of luciferase activity
Passive lysis buffer (1x) was used as a blank solution and 3 µl was pipetted in the first
three wells of a 96-well Packard plate. Next, 3 µl of each sample was pipetted as
triplicates in the following wells, and 18 µl of 1x Passive lysis buffer was then added
to each well. Finally, 90 µl of luciferase assay substrate solution, BriteLite Plus (Perkin
Elmer), was applied to each well directly before initiating the analysis. The luciferase
activity was then measured using Hidex Sense Microplate Reader (Hidex) with the
following setup: luminescence IR cutoff 1 s. Measured values were normalized by
utilizing β-galactosidase assay and the obtained data was processed by using Microsoft
Excel.
4.7 β-galactosidase assay
β-galactosidase is a commonly used reporter gene to control the transfection efficiency
in a reporter assay such as the luciferase method. In this assay, cells are co-transfected
with a control plasmid, where a ubiquitously active viral promoter is driving the
expression of an E. coli lacZ gene, in addition to the experimental plasmid encoding
the promoter of interest and the luciferase gene. In this way, the amount of βgalactosidase in cells can be measured and, thus, used as an internal control in the
transient transfection experiment. Special characteristics making β-galactosidase a
highly suitable reporter gene, includes its especially stable nature and capacity to resist
cellular proteolytic degradation. β-galactosidase is an enzyme that functions to
hydrolyze lactose as well as the analog of galactosidase called o-nitrophenyl-β-Dgalactopyranoside (ONPG) (Nielsen et al. 1983; Kang et al. 2002). During the
56

Jenny Pessa

hydrolysis, ONPG substrate is converted into galactose and o-nitrophenol, which is a
chromophore responsible for the observed change in coloration, resulting in a yellowcolored solution. The produced chromophore is directly proportional to the βgalactosidase expression, thus enabling quantitative measurement of β-galactosidase
activity in the solution by using a microplate reader or a spectrophotometer.
In this experiment, the β-galactosidase activity was measured in order to normalize
the transfection efficiency of cells used in the luciferase assay. The transfection of
cells with pSTARR-luciferase, pSNAI2, pMMP9, and each HSF2 gene construct was
therefore accompanied by a co-transfection of plasmids encoding β-galactosidase.
4.7.1 Measurement of β-galactosidase activity
In order to verify transfection efficiency and normalize the measured luciferase
signals, β-galactosidase activity for respective sample was determined. This was done
by employing the β-galactosidase assay. First, ONPG buffer was prepared shortly
before use (see recipe attachment). Second, 1x Passive lysis buffer was once again
used as a blank solution and 3 µl was pipetted in the first three wells of a 96-well plate.
Concomitantly, 3 µl of each sample lysate was added in the following wells as
triplicates. Third, 200 µl of ONPG buffer was applied to each well. The plate was then
covered with transparent tape, to prevent evaporation, and incubated for at least 30
min at 37 °C until the color had turned yellowish. Finally, the β-galactosidase activity
was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm using the Hidex Sense
Microplate Reader (Hidex).
4.8 Wound healing assay
The directional migration capacity of cells during wound healing can be studied in
vivo by utilizing a simple and inexpensive technique called wound healing assay. This
method is useful in estimating cancer cell migration, hence it is commonly applicable
for quantifying the migratory capacity of cells. The basic steps in this assay involve
culturing of cells to a confluent monolayer, followed by the creation of a scratch to the
confluent cell sheet, mimicking a wound, and ultimately the monitoring of wound
closure by real-time imaging (Figure 15) (Grada et al. 2017). Images are captured at
the beginning and in regular intervals until the wound has closed. The wound area
within each image is compared and analyzed, enabling quantification of cell migration
57

Jenny Pessa

and the rate of wound closure. The wound healing assay was utilized in this experiment
to clarify whether HSF2 affects the migration capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells during
EMT.

Figure 15. Schematic of the wound healing assay. In the wound healing assay cells are first plated
and cultured until a suitable confluency is reached. A scratch is then made in the middle of the cell
plate, indicated with the arrow, to mimic a wound. Finally, real-time imaging of wound closure is
performed, and the rate of cell migration can subsequently be calculated based on the changes in area
coverage over time.

4.8.1 The wound healing assay procedure
In order to determine if HSF2 affects cell migration during EMT, a setup of cells were
made that overexpress exogenous HSF2 continuously, hence HSF2 is present in the
cells both during control and EMT conditions. For this purpose, one set of MDA-MB231 cells was transfected with a plasmid encoding HSF2 and another set of cells was
transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP. Transfected cells were plated on a 12-wellplate so that six wells each contained 0.5 million cells of HSF2-overexpressing cells
and each of the other six wells contained 0.5 million cells of GFP-expressing cells. In
this way, three technical repeats were obtained for each biological replica. The cells
were let to recover for 48 h before proceeding with the treatments.
Following recovery, culturing medium was aspirated and the transfected cells were
washed with 1x PBS. Next, one set of cells was pre-treated for 3 h with assay medium
(2% serum) supplemented with 10 ng/ml TGFβ, and a control set was treated only
with assay medium. Thus, four different samples were generated for each biological
replica, where cells overexpressing exogenous HSF2 and cells transfected with GFP
were either treated with TGFβ-1, to induce EMT (HSF2 TGFβ and GFP TGFβ), or
retained as untreated control cells (HSF2 C and GFP C).
Following the 3 h pre-treatment, a scratch was made in the confluent cell sheet of each
well by using a 10 µl pipet tip. Next, the cell plate lid was replaced with a special lid
that enables gas exchange, including CO2, in the imaging machine. The cell culture
plate was then placed in the Cell-IQ machine (Chip-Man Technologies), and the
58

Jenny Pessa

wound closure process was imaged at three different positions in each well with a
frame interval of 5 min for 24 h at 37 °C. Following the real-time imaging of cell
migration, the acquired image data was analyzed with ImageJ and Prism for statistical
analysis.
4.9 Western blot
Western blot is a commonly used method that combines several sub-techniques to
allow for the detection of a specific protein. The method includes sodium dodecyl
sulphate

polyacrylamide

gel

electrophoresis

(SDS-PAGE),

transfer,

and

immunoblotting. In SDS-PAGE, proteins are separated in a polyacrylamide gel by
utilizing gel electrophoresis. The proteins are subsequently moved from the gel to a
nitrocellulose membrane, during transfer, with the help of an electric field. Finally,
immunoblotting is used to identify a particular protein by using antibodies that
specifically bind to the protein of interest.
Western blot was used in this experiment to determine whether HSF1 affects the
downregulation of HSF2 during EMT. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing Scr and
shHSF1 plasmids were treated with XV for 24 h, and specific antibodies were used to
detect the level of HSF1, HSF2, and Hsc70 proteins in samples under control and EMT
stimuli.
4.9.1 SDS-PAGE
Linearized proteins that display an overall negative charge due to SDS can be
separated on a polyacrylamide gel by employing the SDS-PAGE method. For this
purpose, cells were first lysed in 3x Laemmlie lysis buffer to denature and linearize
the proteins, and boiled for 10 min to further support the denaturation process. Next,
8 µl of a protein marker, Dual-Color (Bio-Rad), was added into the first well of a
polyacrylamide gel (see recipe attachment) to enable size evaluation of the separated
proteins. An equal volume of protein lysates were subsequently applied into the
following wells of the gel, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using an
electric field of 120 V.
The polyacrylamide gel has multiple properties that contribute to the protein
separation during gel electrophoresis. Firstly, the gel is constituted of a pore structure
network created by acrylamide polymerization, which establishes the basis of protein
59

Jenny Pessa

separation by dampening protein band migration along the gel. Secondly, the gel
comprises two layers with distinct characteristics, an upper gel with a pH 6.3, and a
lower gel with a pH 8.8. pH is a function of the ratio between H3O+ and OH- ions. The
buffer used in SDS-PAGE, 1x Running buffer (see recipe attachment), contains
negatively charged chloride ions and glycine ions, whose charge depends on the
prevailing pH in the environment. In the upper gel, the glycine ions display a neutral
charge, and together with the negatively charged chloride ions, assist condensation of
proteins to a tightly packaged band. The neutrally charged glycine ions dampen the
movement of the negatively charged protein band in the upper gel, also maintaining
the proteins as a tightly packaged band. However, when reaching the lower gel, the
prevalent higher pH and negatively charged environment results in a change in the
charge of the glycine ions. Thus, glycine ions obtain a negative charge and rapidly
migrate towards the positively charged pole. Since the glycine ions no longer dampen
the protein band movement, proteins are allowed to begin the migration towards the
positively charged pole. The migration speed of a protein is based on its isoelectric
point (pI), which encompasses a mass-to-charge ratio within a certain environment.
Therefore, the proteins that are negatively charged due to the surrounding SDS are
separated in a negative ion environment prevalent in the lower gel. However, the
overall environment can be considered as neutral, hence it is ultimately the internal
negative charge of the protein that drives its migration, but as the pores in the gel will
dampen the migration of large proteins, it enables the separation of proteins of
different sizes. Thus, proteins are separated in SDS-PAGE according to their size, but
the separation is facilitated owing to the proteins’ pI and the negatively charged
environment.
Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to a
nitrocellulose membrane by utilizing an electric field, where negatively charged
proteins move towards a positively charged pole. Ions are able to pass through the
nitrocellulose membrane but proteins attach to the membrane through strong
hydrophobic interactions. For transferring proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose
membrane a transfer machine, Semi-Dry Transfer Trans-Blot SD (Bio-Rad), was used.
The polyacrylamide gel was placed on top of a nitrocellulose membrane and three
layers of Whatman paper (Whatman) were laid on each side. Whatman papers were
soaked in 1x Transfer buffer (see recipe attachment) prior to placement. The transfer
60

Jenny Pessa

was then performed by utilizing an electric field of 25 V for 45 min. After the transfer
of proteins, the membrane was incubated in a milk solution in order to saturate the
membrane with proteins, hence reducing unspecific binding of antibodies to the
membrane during the immunoblotting process.
4.9.2 Immunoblotting and ECL
Immunoblotting is a method that utilizes primary and secondary antibodies to detect
particular proteins on a nitrocellulose membrane. In immunoblotting, primary
antibodies bind specifically to their antigens. The secondary antibodies, which bind
specifically to the primary antibodies, are coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP),
enabling specified protein detection in a process called enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL). Consequently, when the membrane is treated with a luminol solution to induce
ECL, HRP functions as a catalyst in a reaction where luminol is oxidized, resulting in
freeing of photons that can be registered on a light-sensitive film. Hence, this method
specifically enables the detection of the protein of interest.
During immunoblotting, specific antibodies were used to detect HSF2, HSF1, and
Hsc70 protein levels in XV-treated and untreated control cells. A milk solution,
containing 5% milk in PBS supplemented with 0.3% Tween 20 (PBS-0.3% Tween),
was used to saturate the membrane during a 60-minute incubation at room temperature
(RT) to avoid unspecific binding of antibodies to the membrane. The membrane was
then washed three times with PBS-0.3% Tween for a period of 10 min each time and
subsequently incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies,
with respective dilutions, that were used in this study are indicated in Table 10. The
primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and 0.02% sodium azide (NaN3). The membrane was thereafter washed again
three times with PBS-0.3% Tween before a one-hour incubation at RT with the
secondary antibody (Table 10). The secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS-0.3%
Tween supplemented with 3% milk. Next, the membrane was washed three times as
previously and then treated with an ECL solution for 1 min. Finally, light-sensitive Xray films (Medical X-ray film Super RX, Fuji) were utilized to detect the light
produced by luminol in the oxidation reaction.

4.10 Statistical analysis
The values obtained from the luciferase reporter assay were analyzed in Microsoft
Excel. A paired t test with a two-sided distribution was used for the statistical analysis
and all control samples were set to 1. The luciferase values were also normalized to
the measured β-galactosidase values for each corresponding sample in order to
normalize the overall protein expression. The statistical analysis provided p values and
the significance was indicated as stars: one star indicating a p value less than 0.05,and
two stars indicating a p values less than 0.01. Analyzed results that were not significant
(ns) had a p value above 0.05.
In the wound healing assay, images of each wound were taken every 5 minutes for 24
h, and the area of wound was measured with the MRI Wound Healing Tool of ImageJ.
The initial wound area was compared to the wound area of each time point to calculate
the percentage of wound closure over time. Due to minor variations in the acquisition
time of images within biological replicas, the percentage of wound closure at specific
time points was interpolated from all the values within each biological replica. The
interpolation was performed using a polynomial function, which in turn was
determined by the distribution of values corresponding to wound closure percentage.
The statistical significance was analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak’s
post hoc test using GraphPad Prism software. The statistical analysis was done using
the values from last points of each curve in the obtained graph.

5 Results
5.1 Size verification of plasmids generated for luciferase reporter assay
Plasmids are commonly used as vectors in order to obtain cells that express a desired
protein. In this thesis, one of the main aims was to determine which part of the HSF2
promoter regulates HSF2 expression upon EMT and luciferase reporter assay was used
for this purpose. In order to successfully perform this assay, cells expressing luciferase
were required. Thus, I had to generate multiple plasmids containing varying regions
of the HSF2 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene to indirectly asses the promoter
activity upon EMT and during control conditions. Two positive controls for the
luciferase reporter assay were also made, where the gene expression of luciferase was
driven either by an SNAI2 promoter or an MMP9 promoter. The four initially
generated plasmids were prepared utilizing the in-fusion cloning technique as
described in detail in section 4.5.1, whereas four additional plasmids were generated
using plasmid shortening as described in section 4.5.4.
Besides sequencing, an additional approach was used to clarify that each gene
construct was of correct size and had been successfully created. Hence, each
completed plasmid was separated on a 1% agarose gel to allow estimation of construct
size with the help of a GeneRuler 1kb DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher Scientific). The
results from the DNA separation of the linearized pSTARR-luciferase vector and each
plasmid are illustrated in Figure 16. The linearized pSTARR-luciferase vector is
approximately 4000 base pairs in size and this was verified by the agarose gel
electrophoresis (Figure 16. Panel A: lane 2). The positive controls, pSNAI2 and
pMMP9, had construct sizes of approximately 5300 and 5400 base pairs, respectively.
The sizes of these constructs were also verified to be correct (Figure 16: Panel B: lane
2 and 3). Each generated gene construct contained the same vector, thus the constructs
containing different sizes and regions of the HSF2 promoter varied in size depending
on how large fragment of the HSF2 promoter had been incorporated into the vector.
The sizes of these gene constructs were validated to be correct as shown in Figure 16,
where the pHSF2-2.5kb construct was demonstrated to be larger than pHSF2-2kb-(∆0.5kb), pHSF2-1kb, and pHSF2-1kb-(∆5’UTR) (Figure 16. Panel C: lane 2, 3, 4, and
5, respectively). Also, the construct sizes for the smallest gene constructs, pHSF20.5kb and pHSF2-5’UTR, were confirmed to be correct and only a minor shift in the
size was observed, as was expected (Figure 16. Panel D: lane 2 and 3).

5.2 The 5’ UTR of HSF2 is important for the downregulation of HSF2 during
EMT
In order to determine which part of the HSF2 promoter is responsible for regulating
HSF2 gene expression during EMT, several constructs containing different parts of
the HSF2 promoter were analyzed by luciferase assay. Additionally, in the assays two
positive controls were added, which contained promoters from SNAI2 and MMP9.
These promoters were specifically selected since they are acknowledged EMT
responsive genes. Furthermore, cells were transfected with an empty pSTARR
plasmid with the purpose of generating an additional control, and each transfection
was accompanied by a co-transfection of β-galactosidase to enable normalization of
transfection efficiency. The plasmids were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, which
were treated with TGFβ-1 for 4 or 24 h to induce EMT, or retained as untreated control
cells (Ctrl).

Jenny Pessa

The measured values from the assay were analyzed in Excel, and the results are
presented in Figure 17. Each control was set to 1, followed by statistical analysis using
a paired t test with a two-sided distribution. The analyzed results showed that cells
expressing pHSF2-2.5kb, pHSF2-2.5kb-(∆0.5kb), pHSF2-1kb, pHSF2-0.5kb, and
pHSF2-5’UTR, display a significant reduction in the luciferase signal following
TGFβ-1 treatment (Figure 17). Furthermore, pSTARR levels were not significantly
changed (Figure 17. pSTARR), and the SNAI2 and MMP9 expressing cells displayed
an increased luciferase expression in response to the treatment (Figure 17. pSNAI2
and pMMP9), which was expected. Surprisingly, the construct where the 5’UTR of
HSF2 had been removed displayed no change in the luciferase signal following TGFβ1 treatment (Figure 17. pHSF2-1kb-(∆5’UTR): Ctrl vs. TGFβ-1). This indicates that
the 5’UTR of HSF2 affects the regulation of HSF2 expression during EMT. In contrast
to the other measurements, the observed luciferase signal for this sample was similar
to the untreated control.

Figure 17. The effect of TGFβ-1-induced EMT on HSF2 promoter activity. The level of luciferase
gene expression was assessed by luciferase assay in untreated control cells (Ctrl) and after a 24-hour
TGFβ-1-treatment. Exceptionally, SNAI2 and MMP9 were instead treated for 4 h. MDA-MB-231 cells
were transfected either with an empty pSTARR plasmid or with plasmids containing the promoters for
SNAI2, MMP9, or one of the constructs comprehending a varying region and size of the HSF2
promoter. The prefix ∆ indicates the region that had been deleted from the construct. β-galactosidase
assay was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. Ctrl values were set to 1, and the statistical
analysis of the measurement was performed using a paired t test with a two-sided distribution: n for
pSTARR and pHSF2 constructs = 3, n for pSNAI2 and pMMP9 = 2; mean + SEM; * indicates p value
≤ 0.05; ** indicates p value ≤ 0.01; ns indicates p value > 0.05 = not significant.

5.3 HSF2 inhibits the cell invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells
To elucidate whether HSF2 impacts the cellular invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231
cells during control conditions or upon EMT, wound healing assays were performed
using cells expressing exogenous HSF2 or GFP. Since the level of endogenous HSF2
is known to be downregulated upon activated EMT, generation of cells expressing
HSF2 even after an EMT-inducing TGFβ-1 treatment was required. This was
established by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with plasmids encoding CMV-HSF2T2A-GFP (HSF2). Concomitantly, a control was generated for this experiment by
transfecting cells with pEGFP (GFP) plasmids. A TGFβ-1 treatment was added on the
transfected cells (TGFβ) 3 h before assay initiation. Additionally, some of the cells
were retained as untreated controls (Ctrl). The invasion capacity of cells was
subsequently monitored in a wound healing assay by performing real-time imaging
for 24 h. The obtained image data was analyzed in ImageJ and the statistical analysis
was done using GraphPad Prism. The results are presented in Figure 18 and Table 11,
and an illustrating figure further supporting the results is presented in Figure 19.
The results showed that the rate of wound closure was similar in cells overexpressing
exogenous HSF2 despite the TGFβ-1 treatment (Figure 18: HSF2 Ctrl and HSF2
TGFβ), indicating that the presence of HSF2 can repress the enhanced invasion
capacity obtained by TGFβ-1-induced EMT. In contrast, the wound closure rate for
cells expressing GFP was shown to be induced in response to the TGFβ-1 treatment
when compared to the untreated counterpart (Figure 18: GFP TGFβ vs. GFP Ctrl),
which was expected and also verified the functionality of the treatment.

66

Jenny Pessa

Figure 18. The measured wound closure rates of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP or
exogenous HSF2 under control conditions and EMT stimuli. The invasion capacity of cells
expressing exogenous HSF2 or GFP was examined in a wound healing assay. Transfected cells were
treated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ-1 (TGFβ) for 27 h or retained as untreated control (Ctrl) cells. Statistical
analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA: n for GFP Ctrl = 3, n for HSF2 Ctrl = 3, n for GFP
TGFβ = 3, n for HSF2 TGFβ = 3.

Furthermore, the statistical significance of wound closure rates were analyzed and
compared using Holm-Sidak’s post hoc test. These results confirmed the observations
presented in Figure 18, showing that the difference between the wound closure rates
of HSF2 Ctrl and HSF2 TGFβ samples was not significant (Table 11: HSF2 Ctrl vs.
HSF2 TGFβ). This validated that the invasion capacity of cells overexpressing HSF2
was similar in both samples even after EMT was induced by TGFβ-1. This indicates
that HSF2 can suppress EMT and the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells. In
addition, the difference in the wound closure rates between GFP Ctrl and GFP TGFβ
was shown to be statistically significant (Table 11: GFP Ctrl vs. GFP TGFβ), and
thereby in accordance to the observation in Figure 18. Importantly, the statistical
comparison of the wound closure rates between GFP TGFβ and HSF2 TGFβ were
shown to be highly significant with a p value of <0.0001, also showing consistency to
the results presented in Figure 18. The difference in wound closure rates between GFP
Ctrl vs. HSF2 Ctrl was shown not to be significant, even though the curves were not
similar in Figure 18. Hence, these results strongly suggest that HSF2 has an inhibiting
effect on the cellular invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells during EMT. The
results presented in Figure 18 and Table 11 were also further verified by directly
looking at images taken at different time points during the wound healing assay as
presented in Figure 19.

5.4 HSF1 does not affect the downregulation of HSF2 during EMT
HSF1 has previously been shown modulate HSF2 expression partially via affecting
HSF2 promoter activity, which was demonstrated to result in transcriptional
repression of HSF2 (Park et al. 2015). Thus, it was of high importance to determine
whether it has an impact on the expression of HSF2 during EMT. In this experiment,
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either a so-called
scrambled (Scr) control shRNA molecule or an shRNA molecule targeting HSF1
(shHSF1). These cells were treated with 10 µl/ml of an EMT-inducing supplement,
StemXvivo (XV), for 24 h in order to achieve activation of EMT. Additionally, some
cell samples were retained as untreated controls (Ctrl). Subsequently, western blot was
performed using antibodies that specifically bind to HSF1, and HSF2 proteins. In
addition, an Hsc70 antibody was used to verify equal loading of proteins in each
sample.
The results presented in Figure 20 show that the level of HSF1 expression in cells
transfected with Scr plasmids was slightly increased following an XV-treatment
(Figure 20. HSF1 Blot: Scr; Ctrl vs. XV). Whereas, cells expressing shHSF1 displayed
downregulation of the HSF1 protein both in the XV and Ctrl samples (Figure 20. HSF1
Blot: shHSF1; Ctrl and XV). This was expected, since the shRNA in the plasmid is
specifically designed to target HSF1 mRNA and result in its degradation. Regarding
HSF2 expression, the western blot result showed that the protein level of HSF2 was
decreased, both in Scr and shHSF1 cells, in response to the XV treatment, when
compared to the untreated counterparts (Figure 20. HSF2 Blot: Scr and shHSF1; Ctrl
vs. XV). Despite the status of HSF1 expression a similar downregulation of HSF2 was
observed in response to EMT stimuli, hence implying that HSF1 does not modulate
the expression of HSF2 during EMT.

of HSF1 and HSF2 was examined in cells treated with StemXvivo (XV) for 24 h as well as in untreated
control cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected either with a Scramble (Scr) plasmid, which
functioned as a control, or with an shHSF1 plasmid to obtain cells lacking endogenous HSF1. The level
of protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to specifically detect HSF1 and
HSF2 proteins. In addition, an Hsc70 antibody was used to verify equal loading of proteins. Kilodaltons
(kDa) indicate protein size.

6 Discussion
HSFs are transcription factors that initiate the HSR upon exposure to proteotoxic
stress. However, these transcription factors also function in a variety of other cellular
processes as well as during pathological conditions by regulating distinct
transcriptional programs. Recently, several members of the HSF family have been
demonstrated to display a function in cancer progression. A key process contributing
to the invasion capacity of cancer cells is EMT, which can be induced by e.g. the TGFβ
signaling pathway. One important member of the HSF family is HSF2, whose activity
has recently been revealed to be modulated by active TGFβ signaling. Moreover,
HSF2 has been implicated to display an inducing effect on malignant transformation
in some forms of cancer, whereas a suppressive regulatory effect have been suggested
for instance in prostate cancer progression (Björk et al. 2016). During the
circumstances where HSF2 displays a suppressive effect on malignant transformation,
its major regulatory activity has been implicated to be involved in the EMT process.
In light of these findings, the major purpose of my thesis was to characterize what is
the driving force regulating the transcriptional activity of HSF2 upon EMT and
whether the expression of HSF2 impacts the cellular invasion capacity in a triplenegative breast cancer cell line during EMT.
6.1 The 5’UTR post-transcriptionally downregulates HSF2 during EMT in an
HSF1-independet fashion
Plasmids encoding an HSF2 promoter region and a luciferase reporter gene were used
in order to determine which part of the HSF2 promotor regulates HSF2 expression
during EMT. Since I had to generate these plasmids myself, the size of each generated
plasmid was verified by separating the DNA on a 1% agarose gel, which allowed
estimation of construct sizes. Each construct was demonstrated to be of correct size as
presented in Figure 16. As previously described, site-directed mutagenesis was used
to correct three distinct point mutations in the pHSF2-2.5kb construct. It remains
unclear whether these mutations are present in the HEK-293 genomic DNA, which
was used as templated DNA to generate the initial constructs. However, in order to
verify this, one would need to sequence this particular region in the genomic DNA of
HEK-293 cells.

In the majority of HSF2-luciferase plasmids, the measured luciferase signal was
decreased in response to an induced EMT, except for the plasmid where the 5’UTR of
HSF2 was excluded, which displayed no change in the luciferase signal in response to
EMT stimuli (Figure 17). These results suggest that the 5’UTR of HSF2 plays an
important role in the post-transcriptional modulation of HSF2 upon EMT. The 5’UTR
is a part of the gene that is transcribed into mRNA but is not translated into protein,
and it is important for translation and post-translational modifications. Previous
experiments in the Sistonen laboratory, conducted using an HSF2-1kb plasmid
containing the 5’UTR, have shown that the luciferase signal is decreased already after
a 6-hour TGFβ treatment, indicating that the process is not strictly time-dependent.
Furthermore, my results are supported by previous research showing that the
expression of HSFs, especially HSF1, is regulated in some cancers by miRNAs
targeting the 5’UTR (Vivinus et al. 2001; Liang et al. 2018). Post-transcriptional
regulation has also been reported for HSF2, illustrated by a study where a miRNA,
called miR-18, was discovered to downregulate HSF2 expression during
spermatogenesis, and the protein expression of HSF2 was in turn increased upon miR18 inhibition (Björk et al. 2010). Taken together, it is interesting to speculate that a
similar mechanism of miRNA binding to the 5’UTR of HSF2 would be responsible
for the downregulation of HSF2 expression during EMT. Based on an miRNABLAST search (miRBase) potential miRNA targets binding to the 5’UTR of HSF2 are
has-miR-4787-5p, has-miR-10400-5p, and has-miR-1237-5p. All of these miRNAs
have been identified in unbiased genome-wide screens, and to date their functions are
unknown. This type of regulation mechanism of HSF2 expression during EMT would
also make sense as numerous studies have reported that the activity of transcription
factors is in several different processes regulated by miRNAs binding to the 5’UTR
sequence (Pandey & Picard, 2009; Caggiano et al. 2017; Guan et al. 2017; Li et al.
2017; Wongfieng et al. 2017; Shu et al. 2018). It would therefore be interesting to
transfect cells expressing the HSF2-luciferase plasmids with commercially
constructed siRNAs of miR-4787, miR-10400, and miR-12347. If the expression of
HSF2 is modulated via this mechanism, these miRNAs should be able to mimic the
TGFβ-treatment and induce downregulation of HSF2 during control conditions.
It is also possible that the molecule binding to the 5’UTR of HSF2 is a protein. In this
case a feasible approach to determine what protein targets the 5’UTR could be to

72

Jenny Pessa

utilize immunoprecipitation followed by mass-spectrometric analysis. In this method
a specific nucleotide sequence, in my case the 5’UTR of HSF2, would be coupled to
biotin. When this biotin-coupled nucleotide sequence is incubated in lysates,
originating from cells undergoing EMT, the proteins will bind to the target sequence
and the complex can be isolated with immunoprecipitation, in which biotin-specific
antibodies are used. Subsequently, in order to identify the bound protein, a massspectrometric analysis could be utilized to identify the binding partner.
The positive controls, MMP9 and SNAI2, showed induction in the luciferase signals
in response to EMT stimuli (Figure 17: pMM9 and pSNAI2), indicating increased
gene transcription during EMT, which was expected. Originally, only one positive
control plasmid was generated, but this plasmid did not show an induction in the
luciferase activity after a 24-hour TGFβ treatment. Hence there was a need to generate
an additional plasmid, where another EMT-responsive promoter region was driving
the luciferase gene expression. However, this plasmid did not either show an induction
in the luciferase signal after a 24-hour TGFβ treatment. The treatment time was
originally set to 24 h since previous qRT-PCR experiments performed in the Sistonen
laboratory had shown an induction in the mRNA levels of these genes after a 24-hour
TGFβ treatment. Once shorter treatment times, 4 h and 8 h, were tested, an induced
luciferase signal was displayed by each positive control in response to EMT stimuli.
Since the functionality of a shorter treatment time was not discovered until the late
phase of my study, I only had time to perform two biological repeats for these positive
controls, thus for MMP9 and SNAI2 the n was 2, while the other samples had three
biological repeats. A possible reason why the 24-hour TGFβ treatment did not result
in an induced luciferase activity could be due to fast gene transcription or rapid
turnover for luciferase. The luciferase reporter assay is a time-sensitive method, and
is highly dependent on protein kinetics, rapid transcription and protein turnover could
therefore result in the degradation of the luciferase protein before an induction is
evident. Furthermore, the plasmid DNA lacks introns and histones, meaning that no
RNA-splicing events or DNA reorganization by histone-modifying complexes are
required, and it is likely that these features contribute to a fast transcription of the
plasmid DNA. Concomitantly, the faster the gene is transcribed and translated into
protein, the faster the protein is susceptible for degradation, yet in its defined turnover

73

Jenny Pessa

time. However, further experiments would be required for optimization since the
kinetics for MMP9 and SNAI2 constructs are unknown.
In future studies, one alternative to determine the kinetics for these controls would be
to chemically inhibit the proteasome by utilizing commercially available proteasome
inhibitors, e.g. bortezomib or MG132. Proteasome inhibitors prevent the activity of a
proteolytic complex, which is responsible for degrading ubiquitylated proteins,
thereby preventing degradation of a large set of proteins, as more than 80% of proteins
are degraded by this complex (Kubiczkova et al. 2014). In this way the effect of protein
turnover could be minimized. This method could improve the kinetics of the assay and
toxicity would not be a major issue, since proteasome inhibition is not detrimental to
cells within a short, 4-6 h, treatment period. Also, previous research has reported the
use of varying sizes of the MMP9 and SNAI2 promoter in EMT-involved studies,
confirming that the positive controls should work but require additional optimization
(Liau et al. 2006; Bai et al. 2017; Mishra et al. 2017).
The results also showed that the luciferase activity for the empty pSTARR-luciferase
vector was not significantly changed in response to EMT stimuli (Figure 17:
pSTARR). A slight induction in the luciferase signal was observed after treatment, but
this increase was not significant and, importantly, the signal was not decreased in any
of the biological replicas. The observed minor transcriptional induction indicates that
the transcription was driven by the origin of replication, since the plasmid was lacking
a promoter. The origin of replication can function as a weak promoter and initiate gene
transcription, thus resulting in a low level of basal transcription that is always detected
(Muerdter et al. 2018).
Moreover, cells that were both expressing and lacking HSF1 were used to analyze
HSF2 protein levels in the presence and absence of XV, which induces EMT.
Regardless of the HSF1 expression status, the HSF2 protein levels were decreased in
a similar manner upon EMT stimuli, indicating that HSF1 does not affect HSF2
expression during EMT (Figure 20. HSF2 Blot: Scr and shHSF1; XV). Although the
exact mechanism modulating HSF2 activity remains to be elucidated, these results
collectively suggest that the 5’UTR is important for the post-transcriptional
downregulation of HSF2 during EMT and that HSF2 is modulated during this process
by a mechanism, which is likely to be independent of HSF1. An additional approach
to investigate the role of HSF2 in EMT would be to perform RNA-sequencing. This
74

Jenny Pessa

method provides information about the entire transcriptome, revealing which genes
are active and to what extent they are expressed, offering a more comprehensive
insight to the biological status of the cell and how this status is altered during EMT.
6.2 HSF2 inhibits the cellular invasion capacity during EMT
The impact of HSF2 on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed in
the presence and absence of TGFβ. Considering that the cells overexpressing HSF2
displayed slow migration both in the presence and absence of EMT stimuli, the results
indicate that HSF2 suppresses the cellular invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells
upon EMT (Figure 18: HSF2 Ctrl and HSF2 TGFβ). This was also directly observed
in Figure 19, where the migration capacity of cells expressing exogenous HSF2
appeared to be similar despite the treatment (Figure 19: HSF2 Ctrl vs. HSF2 TGFβ).
This is the first time that HSF2 has been identified to suppress cell invasion,
demonstrating a novel role of HSF2 as a potential inhibitor of EMT. These results are
also supported by the findings of Björk and co-workers, who discovered that HSF2
expression is decreased in prostate cancer as the cancer cells become more invasive
(Björk et al. 2016). Although breast cancer cells were used in my study, these results
collectively support the notion that HSF2 is downregulated as the cancer progression
proceeds and cells become more invasive. My results are also interesting considering
that HSF1 has been show to promote EMT (Zhao et al. 2011; Schieber & Chandel,
2013; Liu et al. 2016), raising the possibility that HSF1 and HSF2 display opposite
functions during EMT. Data supporting this idea has been provided by genome-wide
screens showing that even though these transcription factors share some common
target genes, they also regulate a set of distinct genes (Vihervaara et al. 2013; Mahat
et al. 2016). It is thereby interesting to speculate that HSF1 and HSF2 would regulate
distinct gene programs also during EMT and that HSF2 could drive a transcriptional
program that has to be inhibited in order for EMT to progress. Furthermore, previous
research has also identified other TFs as inhibitors of EMT. For instance, p63, which
belongs to the family of p53 transcription factors, was shown to inhibit EMT, as its
depletion promoted EMT and the effect could be reverted by rescuing the p63
expression (Lindsay et al. 2011). Thus, p63 and HSF2 might have similar EMTinhibiting roles. A hypothetical model of the function of HSF2 in EMT is depicted in
Figure 21. The migration capacity of cells expressing GFP was induced in response to
the treatment (Figure 18: GFP TGFβ), which was expected and further supported by
75

Jenny Pessa

the observation in Figure 19. This is supported by prior studies stating that TGFβ
increases the migration capacity of cells, verifying that my results are in accordance
with previous reports (Romagnoli et al. 2012; Pang et al. 2016).
Breast cancer cells can be divided into luminal, HER2-positive, and triple-negative
breast cancer cells on the basis of specific biomarkers. MDA-MB-231 cells, which
were used in this experiment, are triple-negative breast cancer cells. Thus, it would be
interesting to repeat the wound healing assay utilizing another type of breast cancer
cell line to study whether HSF2 would similarly affect the invasion capacity of these
cells during EMT. Additionally, as the presence of HSF2 was observed to impair the
migration rate, it would be important to include samples where HSF2 is depleted,
which I hypothesize would increase the migration capacity.
Yet another interesting approach for further research would be to investigate how the
expression of HSF2 is affected in the reverse process called MET. To this date, only
a handful of papers have been published where the MET process has been successfully
induced in cells via hormones or chemical treatment (Zeisberg et al. 2005; Na et al.
2009; Chen et al. 2013; Ware et al. 2017; Watanabe et al. 2019). The conditions in
which MET is induced are difficult to replicate in vitro, but successful MET-induction
has been reported in sarcoma cells, fibroblasts, and melanoma cells (Zeisberg et al.
2005; Na et al. 2009; Ware et al. 2017; Watanabe et al. 2019). By inducing MET
utilizing one of these cell types, I would expect an increase in the level of HSF2, which
indicates that the mechanisms that quench HSF2 expression during EMT are removed
once the cells shift toward an epithelial state.

Figure 21. A hypothetical model demonstrating the function of HSF2 during EMT. The presence
of HSF2, illustrated as DNA-bound trimers, suppresses the induction of EMT-involved genes leading
to the inhibition of the EMT process (left side). Upon EMT stimuli (orange arrow) the expression of
HSF2 is downregulated, which allows active transcription of EMT-involved genes, since they are no
longer suppressed by the presence of HSF2, subsequently inducing the EMT process (right side).
Whereas upon MET stimuli (blue arrow), the expression of HSF2 is rescued and the transcription of
EMT-involved genes is in turn repressed. The displayed cellular phenotypes are indicated below to
illustrate the switch from the epithelial state (light orange cells) to the mesenchymal state (red cells)
during EMT, as well as the reversion from the mesenchymal state to the epithelial state via MET.

6.3 Concluding remarks
The main objectives of this thesis were to characterize how HSF2 is regulated upon
EMT and to determine whether HSF2 impacts cellular characteristics during EMT.
The obtained results showed that, surprisingly, the 5’UTR of HSF2 was important for
the post-transcriptional downregulation of HSF2 during active EMT. The results also
indicated that the modulation of HSF2 activity during EMT is driven by a mechanism
that is likely to be independent of HSF1. Furthermore, this study identified a novel
function of HSF2 in inhibiting the invasion capacity of cells during EMT. Collectively,
these results indicate that HSF2 plays an important role in EMT, and it is tempting to
speculate that a specific HSF2-EMT-inhibiting signature, similar to that of the HSF1CaSig identified for HSF1 in cancer, would be regulating the EMT process. It remains
to be elucidated whether the migration-inhibiting effect of HSF2 is regulated via
specific gene networks or by another mechanism. In conclusion, this study emphasizes
the importance of HSF2 in the context of cell invasion and cancer, and highlights the
need for comprehensive research to obtain a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms regulating malignant transformation, and thereby allowing the
improvement of therapeutic approaches against cancer.

7 Swedish summary
Funktionen av HSF2 vid epitel-mesenkymal övergång
7.1 Introduktion
I det västerländska samhället är cancer en av de ledande dödsorsakerna med miljoner
nya fall som diagnostiseras årligen. Epitel-mesenkymal övergång (EMT) är ett av de
huvudsakliga fenomenen som bidrar till invasionskapaciteten hos cancerceller. EMT
är ett normalt biologiskt program involverat i utvecklingen av embryon och organ
samt

i sårläkningsprocessen. Under

EMT skapar

cellerna

distinkta

migrationsegenskaper genom förändringar i signalräckor, som i sin tur påverkar
transkriptionsfaktorernas förmåga att styra uttrycket av gener, vilka reglerar cellens
rörelser. Dessa förändringar resulterar i ett skift i den cellulära fenotypen, som tillåter
epitelceller att anta en mer mesenkymal morfologi och därmed erhålla en ökning i den
cellulära invasionskapaciteten. Förändringen i den cellulära fenotypen bidrar till
förändringar i cell-cell- och cell-matriskontakter, organisering av cytoskelettproteiner
och cellpolariteten. En viktig signalräcka som aktiverar EMT, kallas för
transformerande tillväxtfaktor beta (TGFβ), och aktiveringen av denna signalräcka har
tidigare visats påverka utvecklingen av cancer. Ett viktigt delområde inom
cancerforskning är att karakterisera samverkan mellan olika signalräckor, som kan öka
på cellens förmåga att överleva. En viktig signalräcka, som hjälper cellen att överleva
proteinskadande stress, kallas för värmechockresponsen (eng. heat shock response,
HSR). Aktivering av HSR styrs av transkriptionsfaktorer som kallas för
värmechockfaktorer (eng. heat shock factor, HSF), vars aktivering leder till ökad
transkription av gener som kodar värmechockproteiner (eng. heat shock protein, HSP).
HSP:n

är

molekylära

chaperoner,

som

stabiliserar

andra

proteiners

struktur. Människan har flera olika HSF:er, varav värmechockfaktor 2 (eng. heat
shock factor 2, HSF2) är en av de viktigaste som modulerar HSR. Tidigare studier
antyder att HSF2 kan hämma utvecklingen av cancer, främst prostatacancer (Björk et
al. 2016). Utöver dessa resultat visar opublicerade resultat från Sistonens laboratorium
att i cancer styr TGFβ-signalräckan proteinuttrycket av HSF2, vilket antyder att det
finns ett samband mellan HSF2 och EMT. Utgående från dessa resultat var ändamålet
med min forskning att bestämma om HSF2 kan påverka EMT-processen.

7.2 Forskningsmål
Tidigare studier har visat att uttrycket av HSF2 minskar i respons till aktiveringen av
TGFβ-signalräckan. Dessutom spelar HSF2 en viktig roll i flera olika typer av cancer
som bröstcancer. Utgående från dessa resultat var huvudmålet med denna avhandling
att karakterisera HSF2s funktion i EMT. Mina forskningsmål var därmed att:
1. Bestämma vilken del av HSF2-promotorn styr uttrycket av HSF2 under EMT.
2. Bestämma om HSF2 påverkar den cellulära invasionsförmågan vid EMT.
3. Bestämma om HSF1 bidrar till nedregleringen av HSF2 uttrycket vid EMT.

7.3 Material och metoder
7.3.1 Cellodling och behandlingar
En transformerad human bröstepitelcellinje,

MDA-MB-231,

användes

som

modellsystem i denna studie. Cellerna odlades i DMEM (eng. Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium, Biowest) innehållande 5 % fetalt kalvserum (Biowest), 2,5 mM
glutamin (Biowest), 50 U/ml penicillin och 50 µg/µl streptomycin. Cellerna
inkuberades vid 37 °C i 5 % CO2 under odlingen.
För att inducera EMT behandlades cellerna med ett speciellt behandlingsmedium
innehållande 2 % serum och 10 ng/ml TGFβ-1 eller 10 µl/ml StemXvivo (XV), vilket
innehåller flera ämnen som inducerar EMT, i 4 eller 24 timmar. En del av cellerna
utgjorde kontrollceller, vilka behandlades med behandlingsmedium som saknade de
EMT-inducerande ämnen.
7.3.2 Kloning
Kloning är en metod som används för att införa en önskad DNA-sekvens in i en
vektor. Metoden baserar sig på användningen av en vektor, som linjäriseras på ett
bestämt ställe med hjälp av PCR, varefter ett In-Fusion-enzym används för att införa
ett önskat fragment på denna plats. Vektorn linjäriseras och amplifieras i en PCRreaktion med hjälp av framåtriktade och bakåtriktade primrar. Gensekvensen som
placeras in i vektorn amplifieras med hjälp av en PCR-reaktion, i vilken primrar med
15 stycken basparsöverhäng används. Därmed erhåller PCR-produkten korta
överhäng, som är komplementära med den linjäriserade vektorn. Den studerade

80

Jenny Pessa

gensekvensen blandas med en liten mängd av vektorn, varefter en kommersiell
reagensblandning, 5x In-Fusion HD Enzyme Premix (Takara Bio), används för att
införa gensekvensen av intresse in i vektorn via homolog rekombination.
Kloning användes i denna studie för att utreda vilken del av HSF2-promotorn styr
uttrycket av HSF2 under EMT. För detta ändamål framställdes plasmider där olika
delar av HSF2-promotorn placerades vid gensekvensen som kodar luciferas-enzymet.
Dessutom skapades två kontrollplasmider, i vilka promotorn för SNAI2 och MMP9
placerades vid gensekvensen som kodar luciferas-enzymet. Kontrollplasmiderna
borde inducera uttrycket av luciferas under EMT, eftersom tidigare studier har visat
att dessa gensekvenser induceras under EMT.
7.3.3 Transfektion av celler
För

att

transfektera

celler

med

de

specifika

plasmiderna

användes Neon TM Transfection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). För varje
transfektion suspenderades 2,2 miljoner MDA-MB-231 celler i R-buffert och 15 µg
plasmid tillsattes i cellsuspensionen. Därefter transfekterades cellerna med en 100 µl
transfektionspipett, som placerades i en transfektionskyvett innehållande 3 ml E2buffert. MDA-MB-231-celler transfekterades enligt inställningarna som anges i
Tabell 2. De transfekterade cellerna placerades på nya cellodlingsplattor tillsammans
med odlingsmediet och de fick återhämta sig i 48 timmar, varefter en del behandlades
med EMT-inducerande ämnen och användes för luciferas-raportöranalysen. I varje
transfektion tillsattes 5 µg av en plasmid som innehåller gensekvensen som kodar för
β-galaktosidas, vilket möjliggör normaliseringen av genuttrycket vid analysen av
luciferasaktiviteten.
För att bestämma om HSF2 påverkar cellernas invasionsförmåga, användes celler som
kontinuerligt uttrycker exogent HSF2 även under EMT. För detta syfte transfekterades
MDA-MB-231 celler med plasmider vars gensekvens kodar för exogent HSF2. För
kontrolltillståndet transfekterades celler med plasmider som kodar för grönt
fluorescerande protein (eng. green fluorescent protein, GFP).
Western blot-analys användes för att jag skulle kunna bestämma om HSF1 påverkar
nedregleringen av HSF2 under EMT. Därmed behövdes celler som inte uttrycker
endogent HSF1. Således transfekterades celler med en plasmid som innehåller en
gensekvens som kodar för en kort hårnåls-RNA-molekyl (eng. short hairpin RNA,
81

Jenny Pessa

shRNA) riktad mot HSF1 (shHSF1). För kontrollprov transfekterades cellerna med en
plasmid som kodar för en shRNA-molekyl innehållande omblandade sekvenser (eng.
scrambled, Scr).
7.3.4 Luciferas-raportöranalys
Luciferas-raportöranalys är en metod som används för att indirekt mäta
transkription. Analysen baserar sig på användningen av en plasmid, som innehåller en
promotorsekvens som driver uttrycket av en luciferasgen. Denna gen kodar för ett
61 kDa enzym som kan oxidera dess substrat, D-luciferin, då Mg2+, O2 och
adenosintrifosfat (ATP) är tillgängliga. Oxideringreaktionen leder till produktionen av
ljus, som kan kvantitativt mätas med en maskin. Genom att kvantifiera mängden
producerat ljus kan nivån av luciferas indirekt bestämmas. Dessutom används en
annan raportöranalys, β-galaktosidas, för att normalisera genuttrycket i proven som
användes under luciferas-raportöranalysen.
Passiv lysisbuffert användes för att lysera cellproven som användes för analysen. För
varje prov pipetterades 3 µl lysat i tre brunnar i en 96-brunnars Packard-platta.
Slutligen tillsattes 90 µl av luciferassubstratlösning, BriteLite Plus (Perkin Elmer), i
varje brunn. Luciferasaktiviteten mättes sedan med hjälp av Hidex Sense Microplate
Reader-maskinen (Hidex) med följande inställning: luminescens IR cutoff 1 s.
Erhållna mätvärden normaliserades med β-galaktosidasraportöranalysen varefter de
analyserades i Microsoft Excel.
7.3.5 Sårläkningsanalys
Sårläkningsanalys (eng. wound healing assay) användes i detta experiment för att
bestämma om HSF2 påverkar migrationskapaciteten i MDA-MB-231-celler vid EMT.
Celler som uttryckte antingen exogent HSF2 eller GFP, odlades i sex brunnar av en
12-brunns odlingsplatta. Cellodlingsmediet aspirerades och cellerna tvättades med 1x
PBS. Sedan behandlades en uppsättning av celler med behandlingsmedium
innehållande 10 ng/ml TGFβ-1 för 3 timmar och en annan uppsättning av celler
behandlades endast med behandlingsmedium.
Efter 3 timmars behandling skapades en repa i cellagret med en 10 µl pipettspets,
vilket imiterade ett sår. Cellplattans lock ersattes därefter med ett speciellt lock som
möjliggjorde gasutbyte i avbildningsmaskinen. Sedan placerades cellodlingsplattan i
82

Jenny Pessa

Cell-IQ-maskinen (Chip-Man Technologies), och sårläkningsprocessen filmades vid
tre olika positioner i såret i varje brunn med ett tidsintervall på 5 minuter i 24 timmar
vid 37 °C. Efter att cellmigrationsprocessen filmats, analyserades data med hjälp av
bildanalysprogrammet ImageJ och programmet GraphPad Prism användes för den
statistiska analysen.
7.3.6 Western blot
Western blot är en metod som kombinerar flera tekniker som möjliggör detektionen
av

ett

specifikt

protein. Metoden

inkluderar

natriumdodecylsulfatpolyakrylamidgelelektrofores (SDS-PAGE), överföring av
proteiner till ett nitrocellulosamembran och immunblotting för att identifiera proteinet
av intresse med hjälp av specifika antikroppar. Western blot användes för att
bestämma om HSF1 påverkar uttrycket av HSF2 vid EMT. Transfekterade celler, som
uttryckte antingen Scr eller shHSFl, behandlades med XV i 24 timmar. Sedan
användes Western blot för att detektera HSF1, HSF2 och Hsc70 i proverna under
kontrollförhållanden och EMT.

7.4 Resultat och diskussion
7.4.1 5’UTR reglerar uttrycket av HSF2 under EMT
Resultaten från luciferas-raportöranalysen visade att cellerna, som uttryckte plasmider
innehållande HSF2-promotorn med 5’UTR, uppvisade en signifikant minskning i
uttrycket av luciferas under EMT. Däremot var uttrycket av luciferas oförändrat i
celler som uttryckte HSF2-promotorkonstrukt utan 5’UTR. Cellerna som uttryckte
plasmiderna med promotorregioner från SNAI2 samt MMP9 visade en ökning i
luciferas-uttrycket efter behandlingen. Dessa resultat antyder på att 5'UTR-delen av
HSF2 är viktig i regleringen av HSF2-genuttrycket och krävs för att nedreglera HSF2
under EMT. Tidigare studier har visat att HSF-genuttrycket kan regleras av mikroRNA-molekyler (eng. micro RNA, miR), som binder 5’UTR-delen (Vivinus et al.
2001; Björk et al. 2010; Liang et al. 2018). Därmed kan samma process reglera
uttrycket av HSF2 vid EMT. För att studera detta i framtida experiment, skulle jag
transfektera celler med plasmider som kodar för sh-miR som specifikt binder till
5’UTR av HSF2 och utföra en ny luciferas-raportöranalys.

7.4.2. HSF2 förhindrar den cellulära invasionsförmågan under EMT
Resultaten från analysen av sårläkningen visade att cellerna som uttryckte exogent
HSF2, uppvisade samma sårläkningshastighet under både kontrollförhållanden och
EMT. Däremot visade cellerna som uttryckte GFP, att behandlingen som inducerade
EMT, ökade på sårläkningshastigheten. Detta tyder på att HSF2-uttrycket signifikant
förhindrar

den

cellulära

invasionskapaciteten

vid

EMT.

Resultaten

från

sårläkningsanalysen stöder forskningsresultatet av Björk och kollegor, som visade att
HSF2 kan inhibera prostatacancer (Björk et al. 2016). Tidigare studier har dessutom
visat att ett ökat HSF1-uttryck inducerar EMT i levercancerceller (Liu et al. 2016)
och äggstockscancerceller (Powell et al. 2016). Detta betyder att HSF2 har en motsatt
funktion i jämförelse till HSF1 vid EMT. I framtiden vore det intressant att upprepa
sårläkningsanalysen med en annan bröstcancercellinje. Därtill skulle jag nedreglera
uttrycket av endogent HSF2 för att studera hur det påverkar invasionsförmågan i
cellerna.
7.4.3 HSF1 styr inte nedregleringen av HSF2-uttrycket under EMT
Resultaten från western blot-analysen visade att HSF1-uttrycket i cellerna
transfekterade med Scr-plasmider ökade lite efter XV-behandlingen. Cellerna som
uttryckte shHSF1 visade en nedreglering av HSF1-proteinet både i XV-behandlade
och i kontrollproven. Då man jämförde proteinuttrycket för HSF2 under kontroll och
EMT, visade det sig att uttrycket av HSF2 minskade under XV-behandlingen.
Resultaten indikerar att uttrycket av HSF2 under EMT inte påverkas av HSF1.
Däremot regleras HSF2-uttrycket vid EMT av en distinkt mekanism, som troligtvis är
oberoende av HSF1. Western blot är en metod som används för att analysera
proteinuttrycket, däremot vore det intressant att mäta den relativa mRNA-mängden
för att studera ifall HSF1 påverkar HSF2-uttrycket på mRNA-nivån.
7.4.4 Slutsatser
Denna avhandling belyser en viktig roll som HSF2 har i cancerutveckling, utöver dess
traditionella roll i aktivering av HSR. Detta framhäver behovet av ytterligare forskning
för att utreda värmechockfaktorernas funktion i varierande biologiska processer samt
patologiska tillstånd, speciellt cancer. Därtill ger avhandlingen för första gången en

inblick i att HSF2 fungerar som en hämmare av EMT-processen och kan därmed
inhibera migrationskapaciteten hos celler.
