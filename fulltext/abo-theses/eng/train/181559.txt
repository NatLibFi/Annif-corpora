Abstract
The treatment of End stage renal disease (ESRD) is kidney transplantation. In order to keep
the transplanted kidney safe in the patient’s body, it is necessary to kill the patient’s immune
cells present in the endothelial cells. Although the use of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone
drugs was found to be effective in killing patient's immune cells, the traditional oral
administration makes these drugs not fully effective because of their poor water solubility and
less absorption by the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, an improved therapy such as a drug delivery
method is needed, where the complete dose of these drugs, with the help of nanoparticles,
will reach the target site and kill the immune cells. Nanoparticles such as MSN and CuS@MSN
can load tacrolimus and methylprednisolone, respectively, and deliver them to the target site.
In the present study, the MSN and CuS@MSN were synthesized in the laboratory using an
easy and inexpensive method that gives a significant amount of good nanoparticles. The size
of MSN and CuS@MSN were ranged from 50-80 nm and 50-120 nm, respectively. In addition,
the MSN was loaded with tacrolimus, and the loading efficiency was found to be significantly
high (approximately 63%) after the use of MSN and tacrolimus in a 1:5 ratio. In addition, the
tacrolimus-loaded MSN was further encapsulated with SpAcDex polymer to form the MSNtacrolimus-SpAcDex complex for further stability. Furthermore, the zeta potentials of MSN
alone and MSN-tacrolimus were measured, and they were -19.1 mV and -19.5 mV.
These MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex were treated with HUVECs for 2 hours, with the
help of WST-1 assay, in order to determine the in vitro cell viability and cytotoxicity. The WST1 assay was found to be precise, sensitive, reliable, inexpensive, and fast. The assay showed
that both nanoparticles and nanoparticle complexes do not pose any cytotoxicity and do not
inhibit the growth of HUVECs. In addition, they are biocompatible. Furthermore, the cellular
uptake of these nanoparticle complexes was confirmed after the result of confocal microscopy.
Thus, MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex can act as a good vehicle for drug delivery
methods.

1. Literature Review
1.1 Nanomaterials, Nanoparticles and Nanotechnology
Nanomaterials (NMs) are defined as materials with any external dimension in the
nanoscale or with internal structure or surface structure in the nanoscale range (iso.org,
2021). The term nanoscale represents the scale with the range of 1-1000 nanometer
(nm). The nm is an International System of Units (Système international d'unités or SI in
French) that represents the length of 10-9 meters. To put a nanometer in context, a strand
of DNA is about 2.5 nm wide, a red blood cell is about 7,000 nm, and a human hair is
about 80,000 nm wide. Thus, the nanomaterial is a broad term, and theoretically, any
material having a length of 1-1000 nm in any direction is a nanomaterial. In addition, this
is the reason why there is no single internationally accepted definition of nanomaterial
does exist, but various definitions in various aspects are used to coin the term
nanomaterial (Jeevanandam et al., 2018).
Similarly, nanoparticles (NPs) are materials having a diameter of 1-100 nm in size (Khan
et al., 2019). Due to the smaller size of nanoparticles as compared to nanomaterials, it
is said that all nanoparticles are nanomaterials, but not all nanomaterials are
nanoparticles.
Nanomaterials are considered a bridge between bulk (macro or large scale) materials
and atomic or molecular structures. In addition, they are the “first generation” product of
nanotechnology and might have 0, 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. Thus, this dimension, along
with the shape, is used to term nanoparticles.
A bulk material usually has constant physical properties; however, this might not be true
in nanoscale. Nanomaterials usually have unique physical and chemical properties. In
addition, these properties are the result of complexity in the atomic and molecular origin.
One peculiar fact of nanomaterial is that they can exhibit novel characteristics compared
with the counterpart in bulk. The mechanical, electronic, conductive, optical, and
chemical properties of these nanomaterials are unlike their bulk ones. Thus, it will be
difficult to predict the actual physical and chemical properties of these nanomaterials at
the nanoscale. It means that they can show different characteristics in different forms
even when they have the same chemical composition. Like nanomaterials, the physical
and chemical properties of these nanomaterials are the result of complexity in the atomic
and molecular origin.
Some of the nanomaterials are better at heat or electricity conduction, some are
chemically more reactive, some reflect much light, and some change color according to
1

their size (Nanotechnologies, 2020). For example, some nanomaterials possess
unexpected visible properties as they are small enough to confine their electrons and
produce quantum effects because the quantum effect is dominant on the nanoscale
level. For instance, gold appears yellow in the bulk one, however, its nanoparticles
appear deep red to black in solution one (ScienceDaily, 2020). In other words, they
possess unique physical and chemical properties because of their nanoscale size, along
with the high surface area to volume ratio.
At nanoscale level (also in nanoparticles), weak Van der Waals forces but strong polar
and electrostatic interaction of covalent interaction exists in the form of particle-particle
interaction. This interaction depends upon the viscosity and polarization of the fluid, and
it affects the extent of particle aggregation. So, modification of the surface layer charge
around the nanoparticle is used to enhance or hinder the nanoparticle aggregation, which
ultimately affects the behavior of the nanoparticle (Nanotechnologies, 2020).
As nanoparticles are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light (400-700 nm),
they are unable to be visualized with ordinary light microscopes. Thus, they need
electron microscopes for visualization. In addition, these nanoparticles are so minute that
they require special nanofiltration filters called ‘Nano filters’ for separation purposes.
There are different types of separation methods for nanoparticles, and the criteria behind
the selection of separation methods will be determined by the nanoparticle parameters,
such as size, shape, and density (Robertson et al., 2016).
Nanotechnology is the study or application of materials at an extremely small level i.e.
nanoscale level. It comprises a wide range of physics, chemistry, biology, material
science, and engineering fields to deal with at the nanoscale level. The first person who
imagined the nanoparticles is an American Physicist Richard Feynman in 1959. He
proposed the idea of a possible manipulation or control of individual atoms and
molecules. That is why he is known as the father of nanotechnology. However, it is only
after the ten years of Richard Feynman's invention, Professor Norio Taniguchithe has
coined the term Nanotechnology. Furthermore, it was possible to visualize individual
atoms and nanoparticles only after the invention of the Scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) in 1981 by IBM researchers.
Nanomaterials have unique and enhanced properties such as higher strength, lighter
weight, increased control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity when
compared with their larger size counterparts. Some of them are even revolutionary in
different fields. Moreover, different types of nanomaterials have different types of specific
properties, and these properties enable them to use in wide ranges with various
applications such as medicine or drug, transportation, information technology, energy,
and food safety. In other words, these nanomaterials are being commercialized.

1.2 Types of nanomaterials
The main parameters for the nanomaterials are their shape (also aspect ratios in some
cases), dimension, and their morphological sub-structure. nanomaterials are usually
present as an aerosol (solid or liquid phase in the air), a suspension (solids in liquids),
or an emulsion (two liquid phases). There are various classification bases of
nanomaterials, such as composition, size, and dimension. Here, the nanomaterials can
be classified into the following mains, based on their composition.

i.

Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs)

As the name suggests, the CBN comprises carbon as the main component, and there
are different forms of these nanomaterials available. The diverse form of allotropic
carbon gives the possibility of unique physical and chemical properties (Cha et al., 2013),
and this diversity results in the varieties of morphologies, such as hollow tubes, spheres,
and ellipsoids (Sudha et al., 2018). Carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene oxide (GO),
graphene quantum dot (GQD), and fullerenes are some of the examples of carbon-based
nanomaterials.
CNTs are graphene sheets rolled into a tube, so they have hollow structures. They are
good in mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and optical properties. In addition,
their properties, such as higher solubility, biocompatibility, and cellular response, can be
altered with the help of their chemical modification. Hence, they are good at various
biological applications, for instance, agents for cell and tissue labeling and drug delivery
system (Cha et al., 2013). In addition, they are used for structural reinforcement as they
are 100 times stronger than steel.
Graphene oxides are oxidized forms of graphite materials and form stable colloids in
water due to their hydrophilic nature. They are good at absorbing near-infrared, visible,
and ultraviolet light. That is why, they are used as photothermal agents (Kalash et al.,
2016).
Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon and have a hollow cage structure (football-shaped)
made up of 60 or more carbon atoms. That is why they are denoted by C60. These
carbon atoms are arranged in a pentagonal or hexagonal shape. They are used in wide
ranges of applications because of their electrical conductivity, structure, high strength,
and electron affinity. For instance, they are used as an efficient contrast agent for MRI
and X-ray (Lalwani and Sitharaman, 2013).

3

ii.

Inorganic-based nanomaterials

This type of nanomaterials are metal and metal-oxide nanomaterials, so they are made
up of metal precursors. Nanomaterials containing iron, gold, silica, silver, or their oxides
are examples of such types of nanomaterials. They can be prepared by chemical,
electrochemical, or photochemical methods.
They possess good mechanical strength, thermal stability, and optical property.
Moreover, having good optical properties, they can be used in biomedical applications
such as imaging. For instance, superparamagnetic iron oxides can be used for MRI and
gold nanomaterials for acoustic imaging. Besides typical imaging, they are used for stem
cell tracking, antimicrobial activity, implant coatings, cross-linkers, and as an agent for
drug delivery systems (Zengin et al., 2020).
Ceramic nanoparticles are another example of inorganic-based nanomaterials. They are
made up of oxides, carbides, carbonates, and phosphates and are synthesized by
heating and successive cooling. Moreover, they exist in different states such as
amorphous, polycrystalline, dense, porous, and hollow forms (Sigmund et al., 2006).
High heat resistance and chemical inertness are the special characteristics of ceramic
nanoparticles. Thus, they are used to protect biomacromolecules from external pH and
temperature (Carvalho et al., 2019). Furthermore, imaging applications, drug delivery
systems, and dye applications also use these nanoparticles (Thomas et al., 2015).
A common example of ceramic nanoparticles is Mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs), which are inorganic based in nature. One of the interesting features of MSNs
is, they can act as a significantly efficient vector during drug delivery systems compared
to their organic counterparts (Zengin et al., 2020).

iii. Organic-based nanomaterials
All the nanomaterials made up of organic matter, except the carbon-based ones, fall
under the category of organic-based nanomaterials. Organic matters such as lipidbased, protein or peptide-based, and polymer-based nanoparticles are organic-based
nanomaterials. Examples of this type of nanomaterials are liposomes, micelles, ferritin,
polymers, and dendrimers.
Liposomes contain lipid material as the main component and are round in structure. They
have a diameter of 10-1000 nm, and they consist of one or more layers of lipid, which
surrounds the aqueous space. They are used for drug delivery (Puri et al., 2009) and
RNA release in cancer therapy (Gujrati et al., 2014).

4

Micelles are spherical in structure and amphiphilic in nature. They consist of a
hydrophobic core, but the shell is hydrophilic. They are formed by the supramolecular
self-assembly of surfactants and lipids (Euliss et al., 2006 and Enrico, 2018), and their
size ranges from 5-100 nm (Oerlemans et al., 2010 and Alexander-Bryant et al., 2013).
Polymers (also known as Polymeric nanoparticles) contain biodegradable polymer, and
their shape depends upon the method of their preparation. They can be either
nanosphere or nano-capsular shaped (Mansha et al., 2017). Because of having a
biodegradable property, polymers are useful for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and
new vaccination strategies (Alexander-Bryant et al., 2013).
Dendrimers are highly branched polymers synthetically but behave like micelles. Thus,
they show properties of both polymers and micelles, and because of having this property,
they can be used for scaffolds for tissue repair, drug delivery, and as a ligand (Virlan et
al., 2016).

iv. Composite-based nanomaterials
These are hybrid types of nanomaterials, which contain two or more types of
nanomaterials. In addition, each of them should possess unique physical and chemical
properties (Luo et al., 2015). Thus, they could be a mixture of any type of nanomaterials.
For instance, a mixture of carbon-based and organic-based nanomaterials or a mixture
of organic-based and inorganic-based nanomaterials. The good thing about this type of
nanomaterial is, it can be tailored, according to the need of applications (Jeevanandam
et al., 2018).
There are generally two types of composite-based nanomaterials viz. polymer-based and
non-polymer based. These are used in the areas of the development of new functional
materials, effective utilization of energy, wastewater treatment, and biochemical
medicine (Luo et al., 2015).

v. Semiconductor nanomaterials
Besides these nanomaterials, there is another type of nanomaterial which can show both
metallic and non-metallic properties at a different time, and this type of nanomaterials
are called semiconductor nanomaterials. In addition, this type of nanomaterials has a
much higher linear refractive index compared with the surrounding glass matrix.
The semiconductor has more bandgap than conductors and less than insulators and
tuning of this bandgap can result in different types of properties with the same material.
In addition, this is the primary reason for using semiconductor nanomaterials to use in
5

photocatalysis, optical and electronic devices for various biomedical applications (Sun et
al., 2000).
Quantum dots (QDs) are examples of semiconductor nanomaterials. They are artificial
nanocrystals and can transport electrons. They can glow and emit light of various colors,
after the stimulation by an external source, for instance, UV rays. The emitting color
varies according to the size and number of the quantum dots. These are very useful in a
wide range of applications such as future quantum computers, medical applications,
high-resolution screens, solar cells, and fluorescent biological labels (Azonano, 2006.)

As mentioned already, nanomaterials (also Nanoparticles) have wide ranges of
application in biomedical, optical, and electronic fields due to their characteristic
properties. Among these applications, nanomedicine, along with drug delivery, is one of
the interesting characteristics in clinical trial fields. In this field, Nanotechnology helps to
provide cheaper but more reliable systems for drug delivery as these nanoparticles can
act as carriers for different types of drugs or medicines. During this procedure, materials
will be built in the nanoscale (the synthesis of nanoparticles) and used to load the variety
of drugs in a slow and controlled way. These drug-loaded nanoparticles are termed
vectors or carriers, and a wide variety of nanoparticles are available that can be used as
vectors for drug delivery to treat different types of diseases. Among these nanoparticles,
Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSNs) and MSN dopped Copper Sulfide
Nanoparticles (CuS@MSNs) will be focused on this study.

1.3

Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSN)

MSNs are inorganic-based nanomaterials, and as they have a 50-450 nm range of
diameter (Karimi et al., 2016), they are usually called nanoparticles instead of
nanomaterials. They are primarily made up of silica, and silica has been “Recognized as
safe” by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Structurally, they have
a solid framework and are spherical. In addition, they comprise a honeycomb-like porous
structure arranged in a 2D network. According to the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature, materials whose pore diameter ranges
between 2-50 nm are known as mesoporous material (Rouquerol et al., 1994). Hence,
these nanoparticles are termed mesoporous silica nanoparticles as they contain silica as
the main component, and their pore diameter ranges between 2-50 nm. In addition, these
porous structures have hundreds of empty channels and possess a large surface area.
A typical structure of an MSN is shown in Figure 1.1. Those large surface areas are
enriched with silanol groups. Thus, the availability of such spaces enables them to
6

absorb or encapsulate bioactive molecules in large amounts and attach or react with
different functional groups of various drugs, ligands, polymers, fluorescent agents, etc.
(Mendes et al., 2018). In addition, such silanol groups enhance the interaction with the
phospholipid bilayers of living cells, along with endocytosis stimulation (Karimi et al.,
2016). Furthermore, the attached drugs, situated over the surface of MSN, can be
subsequently released in a controlled manner (Douroumis et al., 2012). Besides these,
there is a possibility of easy modification of the size of such porous structure and the
surface. They consist of a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer surface. The core
part will be used for drug loading, while the outer surface part for opsonization blocking
and easing movement in the system (Bharti et al., 2015).

Figure 1.1. A typical structure of an MSN (A = outer view, B = cross section area view). Both views
are showing pores like structures, which are actually empty channels.

The typical MSN has three distinct parts, which can be functionalized independently for
different purposes. The first part is the silica framework. Usually, imaging agents are
attached with this frame to track the MSN for diagnostic purposes. The mesoporous
structure, which contains hundreds of pores and empty channels, is the second one. It
can be loaded with drugs or any other bioactive molecules. The last part is the outer
surface of the particle, and this part can be associated with different types of ligands for
targeted delivery. (Karimi et al., 2016).
As MSN contains silica as a basic component, which is widely available in the outer
environment compared with other metal or metal-oxides (such as iron, titanium, and
gold), it has better biocompatibility than other nanomaterials. The Silica-Oxygen (Si-O)
bond is so strong in MSN that it can tolerate external responses and stresses, such as
degradation and mechanical stress, compared with liposomes and dendrimers. It makes
MSN relatively stable (in vivo stability) and biocompatible. In addition, it makes MSN
tolerent to several types of chemical modification. In addition, this nanoparticle does not
need any external stabilizer during their synthesis (Bharti et al., 2015 and Doan et al.,
2018).

7

The MSN was synthesized by researchers in Japan in 1990 (Tsuneo et al., 1990) for the
first time. It is usually synthesized by the condensation of organosilane precursors
around organic micelle, with the help of a base-catalyzed sol-gel process. In addition,
the honeycomb-like structure mesoporous channels would appear in the silicon oxide
matrix by removing the micelle template (Liu and Xu, 2019).
Due to the availability of a large surface area within MSN, each MSN can hold a
significant amount of drugs for different purposes. The drug-loaded MSN can be released
into the specific tissue or organ, or site with the help of a specific method during the drug
delivery procedure. This method helps in the release of any drug concentration directly
into the respective site without releasing the drug into the bloodstream, and this process
ultimately reduces the side effect of the drug (Li et al., 2012). In this way, MSN could be
a good potential vector for the delivery of drugs. The first use of MSNs in the drug delivery
system was carried out in 2001 (Vallet-Regi et al., 2001). Here, in this study, MSN will
be used to encapsulate the drug tacrolimus.
These MSNs are useful in wide ranges of applications such as drug delivery, diagnosis
fields such as imaging, monitoring, biosensors, and thermal energy storage (Valenti et
al., 2016).

1.4

MSN dopped Copper Sulfide (CuS@MSN)

MSN alone lacks functional features and might not be fully suitable for the specific
function required bio-applications. They also have low biocompatibility as compared to
other hybrid nanomaterials. Nevertheless, it can be converted into functionalized one by
incorporating different types of inorganic nano-compounds and doing so leads to the
development of a wide range of interesting properties in such final nanomaterials (Zhao
et al., 2017). In addition, the combination of silica technology with other nanomaterial
has provided the possibility of different types of components in a single nanometric entity
(Castillo and Vallet-Regí, 2019). One of the examples of such a nanometric entity is MSN
dopped Copper Sulfide (CuS@MSN).
CuS nanoparticles are photothermal sensitizer type of nanoparticles, and regarding the
photothermal capacity, they are equally good compared to gold nanoparticles. Hence,
they are considered as a cheap alternate to gold nanoparticles. They possess a d-d
transition of Cu2+ ions, which is responsible for the near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation
(600 – 1000 nm) and can penetrate through normal tissue without significant thermal
injury (Li et al., 2015).

8

CuS@MSN is a hybrid metal-based inorganic-silica nanoparticle that is composed of a
mesoporous silica platform conjugated to copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles. It is around
80 nm in size and has high absorption in the near-infrared range with a peak of
approximately 980 nm. Thus, the solution of CuS@MSN can convert 980 nm laser to
local heat efficiently, and it is the reason why they can be used as a photothermal agent
(Chen et al., 2014). The conversion rate is around 56.7%, and this conversion effect is
independent of the surrounding environment. This feature is especially useful for
photothermal therapy and drug delivery (Li et al., 2015). According to Cai and Chen
(2017), it has higher specific surface areas (495 m 2/g) and larger per volume
(0.68cm/m3), along with an average pore size of 2.2 nm.
As a typical structure shown in Figure 1.2, CuS acts as the central component and is
coated by MSN. The MSN is an external structure and possesses honeycomb-like pores
along with empty channels. It is also biocompatible and biodegradable. The MSN will act
as both the protective layer for CuS and the reservoir or storage for drugs or bioactive
molecules (Chen et al., 2015).

Figure 1.2. A typical structure of CuS@MSN (modified from Peng et. al, 2017). The CuS acts as
the core, while the MSN covers the CuS and acts as an external or outer sphere.

These hybrid nanoparticles can be conjugated with other nano-compounds. In addition,
they act as both the gatekeepers to prevent the pre-release of drugs and the
photothermal agents to kill the target cells (Zhang et al., 2015). This is the primary reason
to use CuS@MSN in the drug delivery system.
These nanoparticles are useful in drug delivery systems, bioimaging, and photothermal
therapy (Chen et al., 2015). Similarly, they are good to make components of solar cells,
electro-conducting electrodes, and different types of sensors, as they are economically
efficient (Li et al., 2015).

Sources and formation of Nanomaterials

Nanomaterials are one of the naturally abundant materials in the world. Besides natural
ones, there are also man-made. Therefore, the sources of nanomaterials can be
categorized into the following three mains:

i)

Nature

Nanomaterials are formed in nature with the help of small or big natural phenomena such
as photochemical reactions, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, erosion process, shedding
of skins and hairs by living animals. They are produced regardless of human actions and
could be released in any spheres of the Earth, such as the atmosphere, hydrosphere,
and lithosphere. During the release, some of these nanomaterials are produced in
normal and unnoticeable amounts, while some are produced along with other microsized particulate matters to such an extent that they will affect the quality of the
surrounding ecosystem. For instance, the nanomaterials produced from the
photochemical reaction are usually unnoticeable. However, the volcanic eruption
produced nanomaterials and other big-sized particulate matters that are not only
noticeable but also affect the quality of the surrounding atmosphere (Jeevanandam et
al., 2018).
Natural nanomaterials are responsible for 90% of total aerosols present in the air. In
addition, these aerosols affect the energy balance of The Earth as they absorb solar
radiation and scatter it back to space (Taylor, 2002).

ii)

Engineered

Nanomaterials are synthesized in the laboratory in order to acquire peculiar special
properties on them for desired applications. It means they are purposely designed and
synthesized with the help of physical, chemical, biological, or hybrid methods
(Jeevanandam et al., 2018).
Examples of engineered nanomaterials are MSN, CuS@MSN, carbon nanotubes, and
quantum dots.

iii)

Incidental

Incidental nanomaterials are produced as byproducts during anthropogenic activities,
such as cooking, smelting and refining, engine combusting, and chemical manufacturing.
10

For instance, diesel engine exhaust is an example of incidental nanomaterials. They are
similar to the engineered ones. However, the main difference is the control over the
morphology of nanoparticles. The morphology of the engineered nanomaterials can be
controlled, but the one with the incidental is impossible (Jeevanandam et al., 2018).

Effect of nanoparticles on health and environment

Humans (also other living organisms) are exposed to trillions of foreign nanomaterial
entities every day. In addition, respiration and feeding processes contribute to the entry
of a significant amount of nanomaterials inside the body of the living organism. As these
nanomaterials are very small in size, it helps them to migrate in the whole biological
system easily. In addition, they are much more reactive than their bulk ones, and once
they are inside the living body, they could affect the health in either positive or negative
ways. Here, both the positive and negative effects are briefly described in the context of
humans.

1.6.1

Positive effect of nanomaterials

Nanomaterials such as fullerene derivatives and oxygen vacant compounds (example,
CeO2) could have positive effects on human health. They are antioxidative,
neuroprotective, and antiapoptotic, and this nature is responsible for the protection of the
liver, kidney, and neuronal cells. Furthermore, nanomaterials derived from silver, titanium
dioxide, zinc oxide, and magnesium oxide are known to be antibacterial and especially
good against E. coli bacteria (Buzea et al., 2007).

1.6.2

Negative effect of nanomaterials

Despite plenty of benefits from nanomaterials, there are some negative effects on human
health. The human defense mechanism has never encountered the new genre or
engineered type of nanomaterials before, and this type of materials could be very harmful
to human health (Jeevanandam et al., 2018). For instance, some nanomaterials are latex
sensitive and can cause dermal allergy. Similarly, the antibiotic nature of silver, which is
good against bacteria, could be toxic to keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The deposit of a
significant amount of nanomaterials can cause Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
Besides these, over-exposure of nanomaterials along with other micro materials will lead
to cardiovascular malfunction. Another example of health risk is the crossing of the blood11

brain barrier by nanomaterials. If the unwanted nanomaterials succeed to cross the
blood-brain barrier, they adversely affect the brain and its surrounding cells (Buzea et
al., 2007).

1.7

Tacrolimus

Tacrolimus (also known as FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug that is
mainly used after allogeneic organ transplants, such as liver, kidney, heart. It is a
calcineurin inhibitor and inhibits T-lymphocyte activity. As a result, it reduces the activity
of the patient’s immune system that helps to overcome the risk of organ rejection (Ngan,
2004). In addition, it is used for atopic dermatitis, refractory uveitis after bone marrow
transplant, and vitiligo.
The molecular formula of tacrolimus is C44H69NO12, and Figure 1.3 shows the chemical
structure of tacrolimus (DrugBank, 2020).

Figure 1.3. Chemical structure of tacrolimus (DrugBank, 2020)

Chemically, it is a macrolide lactone and a lipophilic drug. It is usually available as white
or off-white crystals or crystalline powder. In addition, it is soluble in organic solvents
such as ethanol and chloroform but insoluble in water. It was first discovered from soil
bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis, present in the Japanese soil sample, in 1984
(RxList, 2018). However, it was only in 1994, when the use of tacrolimus for liver
transplantation was approved for the first time by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Since then, it was expanded to other organs, such as the kidney, heart, pancreas,
lung, and cornea (Pubchem, 2005).

12

1.8

Methylprednisolone

Methylprednisolone, also known as Medrol, is a corticosteroid drug. It is used to suppress
the immune system and treat inflammatory conditions, due to different diseases such as
arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and allergic reactions. It is usually white, odorless, crystalline
powder, and sparingly soluble in alcohol but insoluble in water (RxList, 2018).
The molecular formula of methylprednisolone is C 22H30O5, and the structure is shown in
Figure 1.4 (DrugBank, 2020).

Figure 1.4 Chemical structure of methylprednisolone (DrugBank, 2020)

1.9

Spermine Acetalated Dextran (SpAcDex)

Spermine Acetalated Dextran (SpAcDex) is one of the derivatives of dextran and is
commonly used as a polymer to encapsulate various drug or drug-loaded
nanoparticles/nanomaterials (e.g., MSN) and cell derivatives (e.g., siRNA). They are
easily modifiable and usually the size of 178 - 229 nm. In addition, they are insoluble in
water but soluble in organic solvents. (Cohen et al., 2011). Figure 1.5 shows the chemical
structure of SpAcDex.

13

Figure 1.5 Chemical structure of SpAcDex (Cohen et al., 2011)

It is prepared by using reductive amination chemistry for the conjugation of spermine to
acetalated dextran (Ac-Dex) (Cohen et al., 2011). The AcDex is a pH-responsive tunable
acid-labile dextran derivative biopolymer. In addition, it is used to encapsulate the small
molecules and deliver them. (Bachelder et al., 2016 and Wang et al., 2021). Due to its
acidic nature, it is useful to deliver the drug into acidic conditions, such as the endosomal
chamber, tumor environment, and inflamed area (Wang et al., 2021).
The spermine is attached to the AcDex, and its primary function is to enhance the
hydrophilicity, which favors the self-assembly of polymers into nanoparticles. In addition,
this feature is often useful for the encapsulation of drugs or nanoparticles.
It is a tetravalent organic amine found in mammalian cells, usually in millimolar
concentrations, and at this concentration, it is non-cytotoxic (Mashaghi et al., 2016).
However, the non-cytotoxic limitation of SpAcDex is up to 1 mg/ml concentration (Cohen
et al., 2011).
It shows high transfection efficiency of plasmid DNA both in vitro and in vivo and
biodegradability features too. It is sensitive to acids. Since it holds a significant amount
of positive charge on its surface i.e., cationic in nature, it can form a better complexation
with a negatively charged particle. This results in effective targeting into the cell
membrane as it can penetrate deeply. It has no cytotoxic effect till 1 mg/ml concentration
(Cohen et al., 2011 and Fröhlich, 2012).
Thus, these SpAcDex particles represent cationic polymers and can be used as an
effective carrier for drug delivery methods such as carrying siRNA to cancer cells with
minimum toxicity (Cohen et al., 2011).
14

1.10

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and its treatment

End-stage renal disease / ESRD (also known as end-stage kidney disease / ESKD) is
the advanced stage or final stage of kidney disease where the kidney function got lost to
such an extent that it no longer can work the way the body needed and therefore need
to replace. The only treatment for this disease is kidney transplantation, where a healthy
kidney from another person will be transferred into the patient’s body (Mayo Clinic, 2020).
However, this kidney transplantation treatment is not as effective as it is supposed to
because there is always a chance of antibody-mediated rejections (AMBR). In such a
problem, the patient’s immune system recognizes the transplanted kidney cells as a
foreign agent and tries to kill them. This process is called allograft loss. But the good
thing is, several methods can minimize such an allograft loss process. Among them, two
methods will be mentioned in this study. The killing of a patient’s immune cells, which
are responsible for the killing of transplanted kidney cells is the first method. The second
method is the inhibition of T-follicular helper (tfh) cells function, along with the inhibition
of plasma cell maturation and donor-specific alloantibody (DSA) secretion.
The two methods mentioned above are carried out by using the immunosuppressive
drug named tacrolimus. Traditionally, the tacrolimus administration is oral. However, its
partial solubility nature with water allows the low absorption via the gastrointestinal tract.
Thus, there is a need for an improved therapy that could administer the complete dose
of tacrolimus into the target site. For this, a novel approach of drug delivery method,
where nanoparticles are carriers, would be a perfect choice. In addition, nanoparticles
such as MSN and CuS@MSN can be chosen as carriers.
During this novel approach, the MSNs will be encapsulated with tacrolimus. The
encapsulated drug-loaded nanoparticles (MSN-tacrolimus complex) will be further
encapsulated with spermine acetylated dextran (SpAcDex) and becomes MSNtacrolimus-SpAcDex complex. This MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex will be delivered
to tfh cells via a specific type of ligand (here CD40L). During targeting, the encapsulated
drug will be modified with a specific antibody (here CD40LAb) to target tfh cells. This
combined drug and nanoparticles along with antibodies impair the plasmablast formation
and DSA secretion and finally leads to the inhibition of DSA production. Furthermore, it
reduces the tfh’s functions.
The biomarker of ABMR is a complement compound (C4d). There is no presence of C4d
in own kidney cells but present in the transplanted kidney. In addition, the primary
function of C4d is to activate the host’s immune systems and thus activated immune
system ultimately kills the transplanted kidney cells as it is recognized as a foreign agent.
15

To mitigate this problem, the methylprednisolone drug will be loaded into CuS@MSNs
and encapsulated with SpAcDex polymer to form CuS-MSN-methylprednisoloneSpAcDex complex. These nanoparticle complexes will target the immune cells, where
they produce heat by local inflammation, and this heat kills the immune cells.

1.11

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and
Cytotoxicity measurement

HUVECs are one of the types of endothelial cells (EC) that are isolated from the umbilical
vein of the umbilical cord, and this umbilical cord is normally get resected after childbirth.
The umbilical cord connects the fetus to the mother’s blood supply through the placenta
during fetal development. In addition, the umbilical vein carries the blood to the fetus
while the umbilical arteries carry away the blood from the fetus. These blood supplies
deliver oxygen and nutrients to the fetus to grow and survive (Lifeline Cell Tech Team,
2020).
HUVECs are used as a laboratory model system to study the function and pathology of
the endothelial cells, for instance, angiogenesis. They are inexpensive, and the
technique used to isolate contamination-free HUVECs, from the umbilical cord is not
complicated. They are easily available because they are considered biological waste
after childbirth. Since HUVECs are the most studied and available type of vascular
endothelial cells, they are used for a wide range of experiments, such as vascularization
of various engineered tissues and toxicity measurements. The first isolation of HUVECs,
along with their in vitro culture, was carried out by Jaffe and others in 1970 (Kocherova
et al., 2019).
The nanoparticles prepared in this study are supposed to be in direct contact with the
normal endothelial cells of the kidney. That is why these nanoparticles need to be tested
for toxicity against the endothelial cells that cover the lumen of blood vessels. This will
make it easy to understand if any probable adverse effect of these nanoparticles with
relevant cells. Therefore, to execute such an experiment, HUVECs in vitro model will be
the best one, among others. This model will help to explore the nanoparticle - endothelial
cells (NP-EC) interactions and the toxic effect of nanoparticles on endothelial cells.
Furthermore, it is considered a relatively reliable and simple in vitro model for ECs to
predict and evaluate the toxicity of nanoparticles to the endothelium (Cao et al., 2017).
Here, in this study also, HUVECs will be used as a replacement of normal endothelial
kidney cells because both cells resemble each other too much extent. Besides this,
HUVECs are easily available and are easy to experiment with compared to normal
16

endothelial kidney cells. In addition, their proliferation rate can fluctuate with laboratory
settings. Furthermore, their experiment can be performed at normal laboratory
temperatures.

1.12

Microfluidics

Microfluidics is the branch of science that is used to study fluid systems, which can
process small quantities of fluids (10 -9 - 10-18 Liter) by using tiny channels having
microscale dimensions, usually tens to hundreds of micrometers. It is a non-turbulent
system and is made up of highly miniatured devices that contain networks of
microchannels for fluids to pass through or be contained in. (Mousavi et al., 2019). Thus,
it can manipulate small volumes of fluid (up to femtoliters) in a precise manner and the
behavior of this amount of fluid, which is often quite different than their macroscale in
everyday life, can be monitored. This character enables the microfluidic system to
synthesize both the biological and the non-biological particles up to the nanosized range.
In addition to the synthesis process, it can increase or decrease the transfer rate of
ingredients, which ultimately affects the rate of chemical reactions. This feature is
essential for sensing mechanisms which require a binding reaction at a solid surface,
such as in DNA and protein chips (Stroock, 2008).
It is one of the novel and breakthrough technologies. Despite its position in a nascent
stage, it is rapidly emerging and has a big potential for several applications in different
fields, such as biology, chemistry, information technology, and optics.

1.12.1 Fabrication of nanomaterials by microfluidics
Microfluidics can fabricate several types of nanomaterials as it can control different types
of parameters. Some of them are as follows:
i)

Inorganic and hybrid nanoparticles

Inorganic and hybrid nanoparticles can be fabricated with the help of microfluidics.
Inorganic materials, such as metals and their oxides and silica, are used for this process.
Examples of such nanoparticles are MSN and CuS@MSN.
ii)

Lipid-based nanoparticles

Lipid-based nanoparticles such as liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be
synthesized through microfluidics. These nanoparticles are biocompatible and good at
loading of drugs.
17

iii)

Polymer-based nanoparticles

These types of nanoparticles are synthesized by the emulsion cross-linking process, and
the solvent is either evaporated or replaced with the non-solvent. Poly-Lactic-co-Glycolic
Acid (PLGA) is an example of polymer-based nanoparticles.

iv)

Protein- or biomembrane-based nanoparticles

Protein- or biomembrane-based nanoparticles, such as HDL- mimicking nanomaterials
(µHDL), are another example of nanoparticles that could be fabricated by microfluidics.
These are good for drug loading to target tumors.

v)

Lipid −Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles

These types of nanoparticles are fabricated by combining two or more types of
nanoparticles, and as a result of having multiple nanoparticles together, they provide
multiple benefits.

vi)

Lipid −Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles

Another type of nanomaterial, such as pharmaceutical nanomaterial, can be synthesized
with the help of microfluidics. An example of this type of nanomaterial is the
pharmaceutical colloidal sphere. (Zhang et al., 2019).

1.12.2 Advantages of microfluidics
As fluids act differently on a micrometric scale than the macroscale ones in everyday life,
this strange feature is used for scientific experiments and innovations. In addition to this,
it has the following advantages:
i)

High level of precision

Microfluidics system offers heterogeneous systems that are characterized with a high
level of precision because of their high-level design and architecture. It is said that even
a single cell or molecule in in vitro can be manipulated experimentally with the help of
microfluidics. The control of parameters is precise too. Hence, the experiment becomes
a high-level and precise one. The extreme sensitivity of microfluidics is due to the lower
level of detection limits. Thus, it can give high-throughput and highly accurate results in
biological or chemical assays (Thomas, 2019).

18

ii)

Time saving

A microfluidic system can run or process several analytes at the same time or
simultaneously. This is possible because of the compact size of the analytes they use.
The simultaneous running of several analytes ultimately reduces the time to experiment.
Furthermore, both the reactants mixing time and the reaction time for the microfluidic
system are too short compared to the conventional one. So, the compact size causes
reduction of both space and time. Likewise, multi-staged experiments can be executed
with the help of microfluidics in a short time. Thus, microfluidics makes the process more
efficient and gives more throughput in a short time. (Mousavi et al., 2019).
iii)

Cost saving

The reagents and samples used in the biological and chemical assays are often
expensive. Furthermore, experimenting at a macroscale level using these reagents and
samples would increase the total cost of the experiment. However, the use of
microfluidics saves the total cost as it uses a microlevel amount of reagents and samples
because of its compact size. Despite the use of a significantly less amount of reagents
and samples, the results are very accurate.
In addition, microfluidics systems are highly automated and require minor operator
handling. Although there is substantial parameter control over the experiment, the
performance of the system can be well-preserved. So, multi-stage experiments can be
executed with the help of a microfluidic system even with less expertise. (Mousavi et al.,
2019). Furthermore, microfluidics would be the ideal one in a situation, where reagents
and samples are very limited, but time-to-result is critical and no professionals are
available (Lion et al., 2004).
iv)

Accurate result

Microfluidic systems carry out experiments with a microlevel amount of reagents in a
short time. It increases both the speed and the accuracy of reactions. Although the
experiment time is short, it gives results with higher sensitivity because of the few errors,
which arise in a short time compared to the conventional system that takes a long time
to experiment. Similarly, as they can execute the experiment well with minor sample
handling, the data quality would be excellent. Thus, the results obtained from the
microfluidics assays will be highly accurate and trustworthy. (Mousavi et al., 2019).

19

v)

Flexible application

Being compact in the size, even with all their units, microfluidic systems are portable.
They can be easily transported, which increases the number of applications they can be
used for. Similarly, they can be used in the point-of-care application. (Mousavi et al.,
2019).

1.12.3 Microfluidics for Drug Delivery System
There are several delivery methods, such as oral, sublingual, rectal, intravenous,
subcutaneous, and intramuscular, and all these delivery methods are available in
traditional or conventional drug delivery systems. However, those methods also have
plenty of drawbacks, such as low solubility and permeability, the possibility of
degradation by various enzymes, interaction with foods, toxicity because of incorrect
dose, inflammation, irregular absorption of the drug, and the need to use a large drugvolume. The low solubility and permeability features of hydrophobic drugs disable their
complete absorption of the drugs by the gastrointestinal tract (Andrade et al., 2017).
Apart from these, there is the possibility of change in the release profile of the drug due
to the generation of polydisperse particles, limitation in the generation of carriers for drug
loading, and difficulty in the localization of drug in target site (Damiati et al., 2018).
Similarly, during the fabrication of nanoparticles by the conventional top-down method,
mechanical stirring or sonication is used to mix an aqueous phased-API and an organic
phased-surfactant with a polymer. Thus, this process causes low and uneven API
encapsulation and consistency and ultimately low yielding of desirable drugs. (Gray &
Abdulkin, 2018).
However, these drawbacks can be overcome by using microfluidics as it provides control
over various parameters during the fabrication of nanoparticles and the drug delivery
system. It allows control of nanoparticle parameters, such as size, shape, structure,
surface engineering, and elasticity during the fabrication of nanoparticles, and gives the
possibility to synthesize or fabricate a desirable range of nanoparticles. (Tomeh and
Zhao, 2020). As the nanoparticles fabricated by the microfluidics systems are uniform
in size and morphology, these are highly stable, they can load more drugs, and they
allow slow release of the drugs at the target site (Damiati et al., 2018). In addition, there
will be no waste of APIs as they will give almost 100% encapsulation efficiency compared
to the conventional one (30%). Furthermore, the polymer encapsulation of hydrophobic
drugs does not cause the problem of low absorption by the gastrointestinal tract as these
drugs will be directly delivered to the target site (Gray & Abdulkin, 2018).

20

2. Aim and Hypothesis
The purpose of the thesis study is the synthesis of two different types of nanoparticles
with the help of the easiest but the most convenient method. In addition, loading of drugs
and encapsulating them with the polymers will be executed. Thus, the main aim of the
study can be summarized as follows:
-

Synthesis of both solo type of nanoparticles (MSN) and the hybrid type of
nanoparticles (CuS@MSN) in a laboratory for research purposes.

-

Loading of tacrolimus drug with MSN and calculation of drug loading efficiency by
MSN.

-

Encapsulation of tacrolimus loaded MSN with SpAcDex polymer to make MSNtacrolimus-SpAcDex complex for good stability.

-

Execute the HUVECs model experiment with the help of proliferation-based cell
assay to measure the cytotoxicity of MSN.

This study hypothesizes that the laboratory synthesized MSNs can be efficiently loaded
with tacrolimus and further encapsulated with SpAcDex polymer. In addition, these
MSNs and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complexes do not pose any cytotoxicity with
endothelial cells of the kidney.

3. Materials and methods
3.1

Materials

Triethanolamine (TEA), 3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APS), Ammonium nitrate
(NH4NO3),

and

Cyclohexane

were

purchased

from

Acros

organics

while

Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride solution (CTAC, 25 wt %), sodium sulfide nonahydrate
(Na2S3.9H2O), methanol, and sodium citrate dehydrate were from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Similarly, Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) from
Merck, Acetone from Honeywell, Absolute ethanol (99.5%) from Etax, sodium chloride
(NaCl) were ordered from J.T. Baker. In addition, Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) were ordered from BioWhittaker, Lonza.
After purchasing, there was not any further purification of all these chemicals carried out
in the laboratory.

3.2

Synthesis of MSNs

There are several methods/protocols available for the preparation of MSNs. Among
them, the Sol-Gel method was chosen as a method for the synthesis of MSN. In addition,
within the sol-gel method, the protocol from Shen et al. (2014) was followed as it was
found to be one of the easiest but the most inexpensive ones, and it gives good quality
of MSNs. In addition, the reagents that will be used in the synthesis are easily available.
First, a 100 ml Round-bottom flask (RBF) containing 36 ml of milliQ water was taken. In
this RBF, 24 ml (25 wt%) of CTAC solution and 0.18 gm (247 µl) of TEA were added,
and it became the water-CTAC-TEA solution. This whole mixture was stirred gently at
600C for 1 hour. After 1 hour, 20 ml (10% v/v%) of TEOS in cyclohexane was added to
the above water-CTAC-TEA solution. This mixture was left for stirring @ 150 rpm and at
600C for the whole night.
On the next day, the mixture was transferred into centrifuge tubes to centrifuge it. The
centrifuge process was executed @ 15,000 rpm for 6 minutes, with the help of a
centrifuge instrument (Sorvall Lynx 4000 Centrifuge, Thermo Scientific). After
centrifugation, the obtained extract was washed with absolute ethanol. This process was
repeated at least two times. The thus obtained extract might contain unnecessary
templates and to remove these templates, the extract was treated with 0.6 wt% of
NH4NO3 ethanol solution at 600C for 6 hours.

22

After all these steps, MSN, as the final product, was obtained. It was collected with the
help of absolute ethanol and stored in a refrigerator at 4 0 C for experiments.

3.3

Synthesis of CuS@MSNs

During the laboratory synthesis of CuS@MSNs, the protocol from Chen et al. (2015) was
followed as it was an easy and inexpensive method, among several methods of
CuS@MSN synthesis in the laboratory. The whole synthesis method took place in two
phases. The first phase was the synthesis of sodium citrate capped CuS nanoparticles,
while the second one was CTAC capped CuS nanoparticles. The schematic diagram of
the synthesis of this nanoparticle is shown in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1 Schematic diagram of CuS@MSN synthesis [modified from Lu et al. (2015)]

In the first phase, a 100 ml capacity of RBF was taken, and 30 ml of milliQ water was
added to it. In addition, 10 ml of CuCl2 water solution (0.85 mg/ml concentration) (CuCl 2
is soluble in water) and 10 ml of sodium citrate (1 mg/ml concentration) were further
added. The whole mixture was stirred for about 30 minutes at room temperature with the
help of the stirring magnet. After 30 min, 50 µl of Na2S (60.54 mg/250 ml concentration)
was added to the stirring solution, and it was left to stir for 5 minutes. Then, the whole
solution was transferred to a water bath of 90 0C temperature for about 15 min. After 15
min, the solution from the water bath was taken out and made cold immediately with the
help of an icebox. The cooling down of the solution resulted in the formation of greencolored sodium citrate capped CuS nanoparticles in the RBF. Thus, the mixture or
solution present inside the RBF turned into CuS-CTAC water solution.
In the second phase, the solution containing sodium citrate capped CuS nanoparticles,
synthesized during the first phase, was used. 20 ml of freshly prepared CuS-CTAC water
solution was poured in an RBF, and further 20 mg TEA and 2 gm CTAC (2 wt % solution)
was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred for about 1 hour at room temperature.
After 1 hour, a total of 200 µl @ 40 µl/min was added to the stirring mixture with the help
of an automatic pump, and it was left to stir for another hour. The whole process was
conducted in the water bath at 90 0C. When the mixture got cold, it was centrifuged in a
23

centrifuge machine (Sorvall Lynx 4000 Centrifuge, Thermo Scientific) @ 15,000 rpm for
6 minutes, and the extract was washed with milliQ water to remove residual reagents.
The thus obtained product was treated with 1 wt% NaCl solution in absolute ethanol for
24 hours, which helped to remove template CTAC. This treating process was repeated
3 times so that all CTAC templates would be removed. After treatment, CuS@MSNs
were obtained as a final product. The final product was stored in a refrigerator at 4 0C for
experiments.

3.4

Preparation of different concentration of tacrolimus solution

In order to load the tacrolimus in the laboratory synthesized MSN, the powder form of
tacrolimus drug was converted into the solution one. The first solution made from the
powder was 100 mg/ml of concentration, which was considered a standard solution for
further dilution and experiments. This standard solution is also known as the stokes
solution. In addition, the stokes solution was further diluted into different concentration
solutions, such as 10 mg/ml, 0.7 mg/ml, 0.6 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml. 0.3 mg/ml, 0.2
mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, and 0.05 mg/ml concentration.
After making the different concentrations of tacrolimus solution, the Ultraviolet (UV) ray
intensity of these solutions was measured with the help of the Nanodrop method (Nano
drop 2000C Sphectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific). Each measurement and the whole
procedure were repeated 3 times, in order to get concurrent data. The nanodrop method
helps to quantify the particles present in the solution. Thus, it will be easy to determine
the actual concentration strength of tacrolimus in our prepared solution.

3.5

Loading of tacrolimus into MSNs

For this study, the equal concentration of both the tacrolimus solution and the MSN
solution was chosen, and hence it was 0.5 mg/ml. The main reason for selecting this
concentration was the availability of a significant number of nanoparticles and drug
particles in such a concentration. Such a significant number of both particles are
essential to carry out the experiments in a proper way. If the number of particles is fewer,
no reactions can take place in the way that it is supposed to.
In order to load the tacrolimus into MSNs, both solutions were mixed in different ratios
such as 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 (Tacrolimus:MSN). The mixture was stirred
@ 300 rpm for 24 hours at room temperature. This mixing procedure was done in two
sets. The first set of mixture went through centrifugation while the second one did not.
24

The centrifuge machine involved in this process was from miniSpin, Eppendorf. After
mixing both solutions, UV ray absorbance measurement was conducted at 202 nm
wavelength

with

the

help

of

the

nanodrop

method

(Nanodrop

2000C

Sphectrophotometer), for both sets. Finally, these data were used to calculate the
efficiency of tacrolimus loading in MSN.
As the tacrolimus is loaded with MSN only after the preparation of MSN, the method of
loading (absorption) is known as post-sorption. During absorption, tacrolimus is
absorbed through the pores and remains in empty channels of MSN. In addition, this
absorption process is enhanced by the surface Si-OH groups of the silica by providing
two to four linking sites per nm (Karimi et al., 2016).

3.6

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Zeta potential

3.6.1 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) or photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) or quasi-elastic
light scattering (QELS) is a ubiquitous, non-invasive, and well-established method for the
measurement of size, size distribution, and surface charge of the particles, typically in
the submicron region (Malm and Corbett, 2019). It determines the hydrodynamic size of
the particle with the help of both the light scattering mechanism and the analysis of
intensity modulation of the scattered light as a function of time (Lim et al., 2013).

3.6.1.1 Principle of DLS
As mentioned above, DLS uses the light scattering method to determine the
hydrodynamic size and the nature of their charge present over the surface. The
nanoparticles exist in a colloidal dispersion state, where they exhibit Brownian motion.
This Brownian motion causes the scattering of light at different intensities. Analysis of
these fluctuated intensities determines the hydrodynamic size of the nanoparticles.
Similarly, colloidal dispersion is the state of interaction between ions and molecules. This
interaction results in the generation of surface charge over them. The nature of these
charges will be figured out by the same light scattering method. (LS instruments, 2020).
The analysis of fluctuating light intensities due to Brownian motion is used to calculate
the diffusion coefficient as in the following Stokes-Einstein equation.

Here, Dt is the diffusion coefficient, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10 -23 joule
per kelvin), T is the temperature (in kelvin unit) of the colloidal dispersion, η is the
viscosity of the colloidal dispersion, and RH is the radius of the nanoparticles.

3.6.2 Zeta potential measurement
Zeta potential determination is one of the significant characterization techniques of
nanoparticles to estimate the nature and value of surface charge (Joseph and Singhvi,
2019). It will help to understand the physical stability of the nanoparticles. Thus, it can
be defined as the potential difference between the mobile dispersion medium and the
stationary layer of the dispersion medium attached to the dispersed particles. It is used
to quantify the magnitude of the charge. Although zeta potential is a charge between two
layers, it is not as same as or equal to the Stern potential or electric surface potential
between two layers. These are two different types of charges found at two different
locations.
Several factors are supposed to affect the nature and amount of the zeta potential, and
some examples are the pH of the medium, ionic strength, concentration of the reagents,
and temperature. Among them, the pH of the medium is the most significant. However,
it is not only the zeta potential that determines the physical stability of the nanoparticles.
The presence of surfactants, the property of materials, and the nature of the solution also
affect the physical stability of the nanoparticles (Lu et al., 2010).
The value of zeta potential could be either high or low and positive or negative, depends
upon the nature of nanoparticles or emulsions. Nanoparticles with high (positive or
negative) zeta potential value lead to the better physical stability of nanoparticles
because of the electrostatic repulsion of individual particles. The greater the electrostatic
repulsion force, it overcomes the total attractive forces, and this total attractive force
ultimately makes the nanoparticles physically stable. On the other side, low zeta potential
values (either negative or positive) indicate the bad physical stability of nanoparticles.
This is because of the aggregation and flocculation of nanoparticles with each other due
to Van der Waal’s attractive forces acting on them. Generally, zeta potential value ranges
from -100 mV to +100 mV. In addition, the zeta potential value within the range of -10
mV to +10 mV is considered neutral. Similarly, the value ranges from -30 mV to +30 mV
is considered good because nanoparticles become physically stable at this range, while
more than this range is considered excellent because nanoparticles become super stable
at this range (Joseph and Singhvi, 2019). Thus, with the help of zeta potential, it will be
easy to know how stable the nanoparticles are.

In the present study, the DLS method was conducted for both the MSN alone and the
tacrolimus loaded MSN (MSN-tacrolimus). For MSN alone, two different solutions having
different concentrations were used. The first one was 0.5 mg/ml concentration while the
second one 0.25 mg/ml. The main reason for using these different concentrations was
to find out any differences in zeta potential value caused by the concentration strength.
Similarly, tacrolimus loaded MSN (MSN-tacrolimus) in the ratio of 5:1 (Tacrolimus:MSN)
was used to measure the zeta potential. The general process for the DLS method is
shown in Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.2 Typical steps to carry out the DLS method

In order to carry out the DLS experiment, the solution was poured into a cuvette, and the
cuvette was inserted into the DLS machine (Zetasizer, Malvern). After initiating the
measurement procedure by the machine, the result was displayed on the screen, and it
was noted. The measurement procedure of each solution was repeated two times in
order to get the concurrent result. Figure 3.3 shows the machine used for the DLS
experiment.

Microfluidics

Here, in the present study, tacrolimus-loaded MSN was encapsulated with SpAcDex
polymer with the help of microfluidics system (PMD, Harvard Apparatus). For this, a
device was used, which is a basic pump for pumping the liquid. In this experiment, two
such pumps were used at the same time. Besides these, a microfluidic chip was also
used, where mixing and encapsulation of MSN-tacrolimus and SpAcDex took place in a
planned manner.

3.7.1 Design, structure and making of microfluidic chip
There are several types of microfluidic chips available in the market for different
purposes. However, the one used for this study was self-designed and made in the
laboratory, and the theory behind the chip design was from the protocol of Chen et al.,
2015. The chip was designed as a T-junction type. It is called the T-junction type as it
looks like the letter ‘T’, and because of this, it has a simple geometry. It forms the passive
droplet with the help of hydrodynamic or gravitational forces. Thus, it is easy to
manipulate, operate and control. In addition to these, it creates a relatively high
monodisperse type of droplets at a higher rate consistently (Lu, 2018). Another benefit
of using a T-junction type of chip is, there will be a lower variation of droplet size during
the experiment, and the formation of droplets will continue even at less favorable
conditions (Ushikubo et al., 2014). The chip might have one or more ‘T’ junctions, and
for this study, two ‘T’-junction type was designed and made. Figure 3.4 shows the
schematic design of the chip used in the experiment.

Figure 3.4. Schematic design of the microfluidic chip used in the experiment.

28

The T-junction type of microfluidic chip was made, according to the design from Figure
3.4. The required components for this process were a regular microscope glass slide
(Thermo Scientific), two different types of borosilicate glass tubes, each having two
different internal diameters (0.58 mm and 1.56 mm), syringe caps, and needles. Here,
the glass tube with a bigger diameter will be said the outer tube while the smaller ones,
the inner tube. Apart from these, a needle puller (PN-31 Magnetic Glass Microelectrode
Horizontal Needle Puller, Narishige Japan) to cut out glass tubes, and Epoxy resin, along
with hardener, for sticking purposes were also needed. The first step was cutting glass
tubes with the help of a puller so that each glass will be symmetrical and has cone shape
endings. The cone-shaped end of each glasses was treated with sandpaper so that each
of them will have smooth edges along with symmetrical openings. These openings
needed to be symmetrical because it is the place where all mixing of solutions/reagents
will take place during the experiment.
The outer tube was cut with a diamond cutter and put in a specific place that will be
covered with the syringe cap later, as designed in Figure 3.4. Inside the outer tube, the
inner tube was inserted, and this combined tube was placed in the middle of the glass
slide horizontally. The end of each glass tubes was connected with syringe needles, as
designed in Figure 3.4, to connect with polyethylene tubes during the experiment. Finally,
these glass tubes and syringe needles were fixed on a glass slide with the help of epoxy
resin and hardener. The chip was left for about 24 hours so that all these components
get fixed. The microfluidic chip designed, prepared, and used in the laboratory is shown
in Figure 3.5.

3.7.2 Setup of microfluidics experiment
In order to carry out the microfluidics experiment, the protocol from Chen et al., 2015
was followed. All the microfluidics components (microfluidics pumps 1 and 2, microfluidic
chip, and collecting glass vial) were set up as shown in Figure 3.6.

Figure 3.6 Schematic design of Microfluidics process

In order to carry out the microfluidics process, the inlet of the microfluidic chip was
connected with a milliQwater syringe, while the outlet with tacrolimus encapsulated MSN
with a polymer solution syringe. These connections were carried out with the help of
polyethylene tubes (Scientific commodities INC, USA). The syringe solution had the
mixtures of Tacrolimus, MSN, and SpAcDex solutions, in the ratio of 5:1:1
(Tacrolimus:MSN:SpAcDex = 5:1:1). Furthermore, the flow of these solutions was
optimized at a different rate. The flow of MilliQ water was kept @ 40 ml/hour while the
solution having a mixture of tacrolimus encapsulated MSN and SpAcDEx solutions @ 2
ml/hr. The flow of the solution was monitored with the help of a high-speed digital
microscope (Dolomite Microfluidics, UK) situated just above the microfluidic chip.
The parameters including the number of frames and duration could be seen in the
monitor. Figure 3.8 shows the flow of milliQ water solution passing through the
microfluidic chip. The solution, which was mixed through the microfluidic chip was
collected into a glass vial with the help of polyethylene tubes. The stirring magnet present
in the glass vial helped further the mixing of the solution. Figure 3.7 shows the
microfluidics system, along with its components used for this experiment.

picture belongs to the milliQ water

After pumping out all the solutions from both pumps, they got turned off. Then the
collected solution was centrifuged @ of 13,000 rpm for 5 min (Sorvall Lynx 4000
Centrifuge, Thermo Scientific). After all the steps, the extract got collected into another
tube by taking away the supernatant. This final extract became the MSN-tacrolimusSpAcDex complex.

3.8

In vitro cell viability and cytotoxicity measurement

In vitro cell viability and cell proliferation are types of parameters and are used to study
the biological material attached to the nanoparticles. Furthermore, it helps to determine
the toxicity of the nanoparticles against the living material. Hence, it is termed
cytotoxicity. These cytotoxicity assays are based on either assessing damage to cellular
membrane or cell viability or cell apoptosis or cell proliferation method. Here, for this
study, a cell proliferation assay type was chosen. In addition, among varieties of cell
proliferation assays, WST-1 cell proliferation assay was chosen and executed with
HUVECs.
The WST-1 cell proliferation type of assay is precise, sensitive, reliable, non-radioactive,
fast, accurate, inexpensive, and easy to execute. It is used to measure cell proliferation,
cell viability, and cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. It is regarded as highly convenient
because it does not require washing, harvesting, or solubilization of cells, and it can be
conducted in single tissue culture. The protocol or principle of this assay is mainly based
on the reduction of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (pale yellow) to formazan (dark yellow)
due to cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases as shown in Figure 3.9. The formation of
the dark yellow-colored formazan is measured at 420-480 nm (optimal at 440 nm), and
it is directly related to the number of cells (G. BioSciences, 2013). In addition to these, if
the number of viable cells is bigger, the activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase
becomes higher, which further leads to a higher amount of formazan dye formation.
Thus, the metabolically active cells cause the formation of formazan dye, and this dye
can be quantified with the help of scanning multi-well spectrophotometer (Merck, 2020).
Thus, it analyzes the number of viable cells with the help of cleavage of tetrazolium salts
added to the culture medium. In addition, it compares the number of cells before and
after the interaction with nanoparticles, which later becomes the key for cytotoxicity
determination. In addition of these, this assay uses the 96-well-plate for cell culture
(Merck, 2020).

32

Figure 3.9 Transformation process of WST-1 to Formazan during WST-1 assay (G. BioSciences,
2013)

The assay was carried out by following the protocol from the manufacturer’s instructions.
In a brief, first, the HUVECs were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated in cultured
medium for 24 hours at 36.5 0C with 4.6% CO2 (Hera Cell, Heraeus). The cultured
medium was buffered with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (BioWhittaker, Lonza).
Once they were cultured and grown to 80-90% confluency, they were exposed to the
serial concentration of MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex along with the
WST-1 reagent and the Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO). These serial concentrations were
5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, and 100 mg/ml. The main purpose of adding
DMSO is to restrict the further growth of HUVECs. Besides these nanoparticle and
nanoparticle complex exposed cells, a group of cells (blank or negative) were skipped or
untouched with any reagents (except DMSO) in order to compare the result with the
group of cells exposed to nanoparticles and nanoparticle complexes. Each concentration
was replicated 5 times, and this 96-well plate was left for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, the color of the cell inside the plate changed from pale yellow to dark
yellow, and the absorbance of Formazan got detected with the help of a multi-well
spectrophotometer (Varioksan Flash, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 440 nm. The
absorbance data obtained from the spectrophotometer got calculated and analyzed to
determine the cell viability and cytotoxicity of the MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex
complex.
In order to determine the cytotoxicity, first, the cytotoxicity in each well needed to be
calculated. For this, the culture medium background (blank or negative one) was
subtracted from the assay result, and the actual cytotoxicity in percentage was calculated
with the following formula.

33

% 𝑐𝑦𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

(𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 − 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑘)
× 100
(𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡)

After getting the cytotoxicity values of each well, the overall cytotoxicity of MSN and
MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex was calculated.

3.9

Imaging

The laboratory synthesized MSNs and CuS@MSNs were observed under a
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Similarly, a Confocal microscope (CFM) was
used to observe the cell viability assay and the determination of cytotoxicity.

3.9.1

Transmission Electron Microscopy

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) uses the interaction of coherent electron
beams to examine the morphology and composition in fine detail, which finally produces
high-resolution images. Thus, it uses electrons as a source of illumination, unlike in
typical light microscopes, where the light beam plays a source of illumination.
Furthermore, it is different than the Scanning Electron microscope (SEM). The SEM
strikes an electron beam on the sample surface and detects secondary electron signals,
and these signals are used to form images. However, in TEM, an electron beam
penetrates the samples and gives the projection view of the sample. These electrons
have a very short wavelength and possess high energy. That is the reason that they can
penetrate the thin sample. Furthermore, the sample or specimen must be ultrathin so
that electrons must pass through it without any significant energy loss.
As mentioned above, the beam of electrons must be coherent, and these coherent
beams of electrons will be produced only when the working voltage is too high (1000’s
of volts). Therefore, electron microscopes are usually equipped with 50-200 kV of
accelerating voltage (Williams and Carter, 1996).
The series of lenses present inside the electron microscope can highly magnify the
transmitted and scattered electrons. This magnification results in the formation of highresolution images.
In order to observe the MSN under TEM, first, 0.1 ml solution of synthesized MSN, having
0.5 mg/ml of concentration strength, was dropped on an ultrathin copper grid of TEM
sample holder. It was left for around 1 hour so that all ethanol will evaporate. After
evaporation of ethanol, only MSNs were present on the grid, and this grid was inserted
34

into the TEM (JEM-1400 Plus Electron Microscope, JEOL Japan). After this, the images
got started to display on the screen. The TEM used in this study has an accelerating
voltage of 80 kV, and its picture is shown in Figure 3.10.

Japan) used for the observation of nanoparticles

3.9.2

Confocal Microscopy

The confocal microscope (CFM) used for this study will be the Laser scanning one.
Generally, the confocal microscope uses fluorescence optics as a source of illumination,
as in other widefield microscopes. However, it has more advantages over the latter one.
The confocal one focuses on a defined spot at a specific depth within the sample, but
the widefield one illuminates the whole sample at once. The focusing of laser light at a
certain point causes the emission of fluorescent light in the same place. In addition, a
pinhole situated at the optical pathway cuts off signals that are out of focus and lets
fluorescent signals enter only from the focused point (Fellers and Davidson, 2020).
It scans the specimen in a raster pattern so that images of one single optical plane are
created at once. As it scans several optical planes in a different timeframe, it can be also
used for thick specimens. In addition, after scanning all the optical planes, it can create
3D images. Besides these, it is possible to analyze the multicolor immunofluorescence
staining with the help of a confocal microscope as it comprises several lasers, along with
several emission and excitation filters (Ibdi, 2020).
For the present study, the primary purpose of carrying out confocal microscopy imaging
was to validate the cellular uptake of the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex by
HUVECs. During this procedure, 3 sets of the Petri dishes containing HUVECs were
35

taken. These were labeled with ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’. The dish ‘A’ was supposed to fix after 2
hours, while the dish ‘B’, 6 hours, and the dish ‘C’, 24 hours. All of these Petri dishes
were fixed with MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex and fluorescent particles. For this
process, the reagent Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (BioWhittaker, Lonza) helped to fix the
cells and the nanoparticle complexes together. The fluorescent particle used in this
process was Cyanine 5 (Cy5). It is a bright far-red fluorescent dye and has 650 nm of
excitation and 670 nm of emission wavelength. After fixing the cells, their growth was
supposed to stop, and these were further stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). DAPI was used to stain nucleic acid for fluorescence microscopy and helped to
determine the number of nuclei and assess gross cell morphology (Merck, 2020). Finally,
all of these Petri dishes were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss
LSM780, Zeiss), and the images seen through the microscope were also captured. The
objective lens used was 20x, 40x, and 63x. Furthermore, as the captured images were
raw, they were further processed and analyzed with the help of Zen Lite software (Zen
3.3, Carl Zeiss Microscopy).

MSNs under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)

The laboratory synthesized MSNs were observed with the help of TEM. They were
spherical in size and about 50 - 80 nm in diameter. Furthermore, there were clear
mesoporous structures, and these mesoporous structures were arranged in order. The
empty channels around the core were also seen clearly. These empty channels were the
place where tacrolimus will be placed during loading. Figure 4.1 shows the structure of
MSNs under TEM.

After synthesis of CuS@MSN, they were observed under TEM. According to Figure 4.2,
the CuS@MSN contains CuS as core material and the MSN as an outer sphere. In
addition to the spherical ones, they were found in other shapes too, such as rod-shaped.
Some of these nanoparticles were found alone, some aggregated together, and some
formed a cluster. The size of these nanoparticles varied from 50 - 120 nm.

Loading of Tacrolimus with MSNs

After the measurement of the UV ray intensity of tacrolimus, the data were collected. The
data included the concentration of the tacrolimus, the value of UV ray intensity (average),
and the standard deviation. The data are shown in table 4.1 and with the help of these
data, the graph was drawn as shown in Figure 4.3.

the particles present in the solution and thus, determines the concentration strength of the
solution.

In the graph of Figure 4.3, the black line shows the actual UV ray intensity absorption by
tacrolimus, while the red line is the ideal one (used for fitting with linear one). Thus, it
shows that the UV ray intensity absorption by different concentrations of tacrolimus
solutions (from 0.1 mg/ml to 0.5 mg/ml) followed the linear curve. In addition, with the
help of the graph, the actual concentration of tacrolimus solution, synthesized in the
laboratory, was calculated.
The actual amount of tacrolimus loaded in MSNs was dependent on the concentration
of MSNs and calculated by the following formula.
Amount of tacrolimus loaded in MSN =

As seen in Table 4.2, it was found that the 5:1 ratio of tacrolimus and MSN has the
highest loaded amount, among other ratios. Thus, these findings show that
approximately 63% of tacrolimus will be loaded into MSN when 5:1 ratio tacrolimus and
MSNs are used.

Zeta potential measurement of MSN

The zeta potential measurement of MSN alone showed a negative charge. At 0.5 mg/ml
concentration, the average value was -15.1 mV with standard deviation of 0.513, while
at 0.25 mg/ml concentration, it was found to be -19.6 mV with standard deviation of
0.854. The higher the concentration, the higher the value will be negative. The detail
values are shown in table 4.3.

Microfluidics

After carrying out the microfluidics experiment, the tacrolimus-loaded MSNs got further
encapsulated by SpAcDex polymer to form the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex. This
MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex is now ready for further research. The SpAcDex
polymers cover the MSN-tacrolimus complex from the outside and give more stability.

4.6

In Vitro Cell Viability and cytotoxicity measurement

After the calculation of in vitro cell viability and cytotoxicity with the help of absorbance
values of respective well plates through WST-1 assay, the actual cell viability was
obtained. A graph was drawn using the data obtained from cell viability in percentage
and both the MSN and the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex concentration strengths.
The graph is shown in Figure 4.4, where the x-axis represents the concentration
strengths of MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex, while the y-axis, the cell viability in
percentage.

42

Figure 4.4. The graph showing the relationship between the concentration of MSN, MSNtacrolimus-SpAcDex and HUVECs viability. The HUVECs were treated with either nanoparticles
or nanoparticle-drug-polymer complexes for about 2 hours.

As we can see in the graph of Figure 4.4, there was almost no cytotoxic effect up to the
use of 50 mg/ml of both MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex as the cell viability
till this concentration was nearly more than 90%. After using more than 50 mg/ml
concentration, cell viability got decreased. It means the cytotoxic effect of these
nanoparticles and nanoparticle complexes on HUVECs got started after using
significantly high concentrations (around 100 mg/ml). However, the maximum cytotoxic
effect shown was approximately 30% only.

4.7

Cells under Confocal Microscope (CFM)

As the main purpose of the confocal microscopy in the present study is to confirm the
cellular uptake of the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex, a series of images were taken
with the help of laser scanning confocal microscope. Those images were presented in
Figure 4.5. So, Figure 4.5 showed the real situations of nanoparticle complexes uptake
by HUVECs. Figure 4.5 is started with a cellular uptake image at 2 hours @ 40x (image
‘A’). From these images, it can be confirmed that the up-taking process already took
place in 2 hours, as an image (‘A’) showed a little bit of red-colored dots. These dots
were from the fluorescence particle (cyn5), and these are associated with the
nanoparticle complexes. As time increases, concentration strengths of nanoparticle
complexes were also in the increasing trend. It caused the appearance of more redcolored dots in images from both 6 hours and 24 hours than that of 2 hours. Therefore,
images (‘A’) and (‘B’) comprised the lowest concentration of MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex
complex, while images (‘E’) and (‘F’), the highest one.

5. Discussion
Nanomaterials and nanoparticles are any substances with one of the dimensions in
nanoscale. The synthesis of these nanoparticles in the laboratory does not possess
complicated techniques and is not time-consuming. MSN and CuS@MSN are examples
of nanoparticles. The particles at the nanoscale level possess unique characteristics that
are not present at their macroscale ones. These unique characteristics could be used for
different purposes in different fields. Among these purposes, drug delivery is one of the
interesting features, where the drug is loaded with nanoparticles and delivered to specific
sites.
End stage renal disease is the last stage of kidney disease where the kidney needs to
be replaced with a new one as the patient’s kidney cannot work as normal anymore.
However, after the kidney replacement, there is always a risk of kidney failure as the
host’s immune system recognizes the transplanted kidney as a foreign agent and tries
to kill it all the time. The best treatment of this problem is to kill the host’s immune cells
present in the kidney with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone drugs. Therefore, it would
be a great solution if these drugs could be loaded into nanoparticles and delivered
directly into endothelial cells of the kidney. This is the reason why we have chosen MSNs
and tacrolimus drugs.
This thesis study was executed in order to know more about MSNs. Thus, we
hypothesized that the laboratory synthesis of nanoparticles is easy, and the MSN has a
good tacrolimus loading capacity with no significant cytotoxic effect. During the study,
the drug loading capacity and the efficiency of MSNs with tacrolimus drug were analyzed.
Furthermore, both the nature and the value of electric charges, present on the surface
of MSN alone and tacrolimus loaded MSN, were also calculated. Furthermore, the
cytotoxic effect of both the MSNs and the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complexes was
figured out. However, during the cytotoxic test (assay), HUVECs were used instead of
actual endothelial cells of a kidney because both cells resemble each other to a greater
extent. In addition, the availability of HUVECs was higher and easier compared with
endothelial cells of the kidney.

5.1 Synthesis of MSN and CuS@MSN in the laboratory is easy and
the outcome is good
The synthesis of MSN and CuS@MSN in the laboratory is easy, and the whole procedure
for both nanoparticles comprises a few steps which are to be followed in order. The
procedure steps of MSN synthesis were followed from the protocol of Shen et al. (2014),
while the CuS@MSN one from the Chen et al. (2015) one.
Shen et al. (2014) synthesized hollow MSNs along with pores in a variety of sizes.
According to them, the manipulation of TEOS concentration in cyclohexane gives rise to
different sizes of MSNs, ranging from 5 - 180 nm. In our study, the range of hollow MSNs
found was about 50 - 80 nm using TEOS in Cyclohexane 10%v/v, and the size of the
MSNs is similar to that of the study by Shen et al. (2014).
In addition, the suspension method gives MSNs in a stable colloid solution in a
concentrated amount with a size of approximately 50 nm (Wu et al., 2013). Both the
condensation rate and the pH value affect the diameter of MSNs as Qiao et al. (2009)
found MSNs of different sizes (30-85 nm) by the manipulation of those parameters. In
addition, the method which uses Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as an
ingredient produces bigger-sized MSNs as 600-700 nm-sized MSNs were synthesized
by Vazquez et al. (2017), who have used additional CTAB during the synthesis of MSNs.
Yang et al. (2020) confirmed the size of synthesized MSNs of about 60 nm with the help
of TEM and SEM during their experiment. Ngamcherdtrakul et al. (2018) synthesized the
MSNs after the same protocol as in this study, where they got the MSNs with an average
size of 50 nm. Furthermore, these synthesized MSNs were successfully used as
nanocarriers.
Similarly, the CuS@MSNs, synthesized by Chen et al. (2015), have an average particle
size of 65 nm. Furthermore, they changed the amount of CTAC (25 wt % solution) from
2 gm (or ∼20 mg/mL by concentration) to 0.5 gm (or ∼5 mg/mL by concentration) and
found nanoparticles of the size of 30-40 nm. Here, our study, which follows the same
protocol, got 50-120 nm-sized nanoparticles by using 2 gm CTAC.
During the synthesis of CuS@MSN, Lu et al. (2019) found the sizes of nanoparticles of
33 nm, 44 nm, and 48 nm, when the amount of TEOS used was 170 ml, 180 ml, and 200
ml, respectively. In our study, the amount of TEOS used was 200 mL and got similarsized nanoparticles. Yang et al. (2020) found the size of CuS@MSN of around 85 nm
under TEM. Similarly, with the help of TEM, the hydrodynamic diameter of CuS@MSN
was found to be approximately 70 nm in the experiment carried out by Wu et al. (2014).
In addition, the average hydrodynamic diameter measured by Lu et al. (2015) was 49.5
47

nm. This size is excellent for passively targeting solid tumors, and in our case, we got
the size of CuS@MSN under the same suitable range.
It is said that nanoparticles with a diameter below 300 nm are suitable to use as
nanocarriers for drug delivery systems because these ranges of nanoparticles are easily
taken up into cells. In addition, nanoparticles that are bigger than this range may
stimulate an immune response and would not be as effective as they are supposed to
be (Karimi et al., 2016). Thus, after comparing the other’s results of the same type of
experiment with our one, it was found that our synthesized nanoparticles can be
considered as good nanoparticles as they are well below 300 nm and in good shape.
These nanoparticles can be used for different purposes, including nanocarriers in drug
delivery systems. Moreover, the whole procedure to synthesize nanoparticles (both the
MSN and the Cus@MSN) is easy and yields a good amount of nanoparticles.

5.2 Loading of tacrolimus into MSN is easy, convenient, low cost
and has significantly higher efficiency
In the present study, tacrolimus is the drug that loaded into the MSNs. The amount and
easiness of the tacrolimus loading process depend upon the type of nanocarriers and
methods. For example, Liu et al. (2016) loaded the drug tacrolimus into MSN, along with
other lipids excipients, and found out that the drug loading process was simple, low cost,
ecological, and easy to obtain at an industrial scale.
During the experiment executed by Paiva et al. (2020), they got the result of tacrolimus
loading into MSN with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (MSN-APTES) as 7%. Similarly,
Khan et al. (2016) revealed the significantly high solubilization of tacrolimus through in
vitro lipolysis studies and the use of aqueous phase of nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC),
and the result was 69.3%.
In some cases, the rate of tacrolimus loading was strange. For example, Lamprecht et
al. (2005) got the result of less than 1% of tacrolimus loading in nanoparticles at room
temperature. But, under an ice bath, they found that it was around 40%. In our
experiment, we got approximately 63% loading of tacrolimus in MSN, under the 5:1 ratio
of tacrolimus and MSN. In addition, our drug loading experiment did not need any extra
lipid or carrier to enhance the loading. The drug was simply loaded by stirring and further
encapsulated with SpAcDex through microfluidics.
It is also found that a different nanocarrier than MSN, such as Peptide-Decorated
PEG−PBG (PEP-PEG-PBG) polymer, could encapsulate the tacrolimus drug at the rate
of 60% when using 4:1 ratio (tacrolimus:PEP-PEG-PBG). In addition, this amount was
48

considered a relatively high amount compared with other polymeric micelles. (Lin et al.,
2019). Likewise, Harun et al. (2021) successfully loaded the moderate amount of
Ruthenium Polypyridyl drug into MSN and called it an ideal method for drug delivery. In
our experiment, we loaded a significantly good amount of tacrolimus drug, and thus we
can consider MSN as an excellent carrier for drug delivery.
The tacrolimus-MSN loading process of this study can be considered as easy and
convenient. First, it got higher loading efficiency of approximately 63%. This efficiency
was obtained by using the MSN and the tacrolimus in the ratio of 1:5, only by stirring @
300 rpm for 24 hours. In addition, it is a low-cost method as it does not need any
complicated method or special apparatus for stirring purposes. Second, the experiment
was conducted at normal room temperature.
Since it is a novel approach and tried for the first time, there could have been several
factors, which directly or indirectly can affect the loading of tacrolimus. As it was seen in
the experiment, the mixture-stirring time and the temperature in the loading process are
crucial factors. Thus, manipulation of these factors could have given a different result
than the one we got in our study.

5.3 The value of zeta potential determines the physical stability of
MSNs
The physical stability of the nanoparticle depends upon the electric charge over its
surface, and this electric charge is called zeta potential. In addition, this electric charge
could be either positive or negative. Furthermore, it is found that the bigger the value of
electric charge (could be positive or negative), the more stable the particle and vice
versa. (Lu and Gao, 2010). Here, the same principle applies to MSN too. As zeta
potential values ranging from -10 mV to +10 mV are considered as lower threshold range
(neutral), nanoparticles (MSN too) with zeta potential value more than this range are
considered as good and physically stable (Joseph and Singhvi, 2019).
Vazquez et al. (2017) team found the zeta potential value of MSN around 40 – 45 mV in
their study, and due to its bigger value, they called it super stable MSN. Similarly, -30.7
mV by Luo et al. (2014) and -30 mV by Perez (2019) were recorded as zeta potential
values of MSN, and these MSNs are stable too. Kim et al. (2021) synthesized the
different sizes of MSNs by using the ingredients in different amounts. They also found
different values of zeta potential, ranges from -9.3 to +25.7 mV. The study conducted by
Luo et al. (2014) showed that the zeta potential of MSN was around -23 mV. In our
experiment, we found different zeta potential values from different concentration
strengths of MSNs, and these values are ranged from -15 mV to -20 mV. As the zeta
49

potential values of MSNs from our experiment are higher than the lower threshold range,
these MSNs can be considered as good and physically stable ones.
Lin et al. (2019) succeeded in the encapsulation of tacrolimus with PEP−PEG−PBGderived nanomicelle, along with good loading efficiency in their experiment. In addition,
before encapsulating the tacrolimus, they found the zeta potential value of
PEP−PEG−PBG-derived nanomicelle +14 mV. In addition, they mentioned the
nanomicelle physically stable. Likewise, Zhang et al. (2021) found the zeta potential
value of amino-derived MSN (MSN@NH2) as +35 mV, and it was also physically stable.
Another team, Paiva et al. (2020), found varieties of zeta potential values from MSN and
its derivatives. They found a zeta potential value of MSN around -25mV, MSN-APTES
around +30 mV, and MSN-APTES-tacrolimus around +33 mV. But, in our study, the zeta
potential value of MSN (0.5 mg/ml concentration) was around -15 mV, and the zeta
potential value of MSN-Tacrolimus (both have 0.5 mg/ml concentration) was also the
same. Despite the differences in zeta potential values of the study done by Paiva et al.
(2020) with our one, it can be said that the tacrolimus does not pose any significant
electric charge. The change in zeta potential value in the study of Paiva et al. (2020) was
due to the modification of MSN with APTES. In our experiment, MSN was not modified
with any group, and this group was responsible for the change in the nature and value
of zeta potential. Thus, the loading of tacrolimus into MSN without modification did not
affect the nature and value of zeta potential.
During an experiment carried out by Hu et al. (2017), the zeta potential value of MSN
was found as -25 mV. However, the negative electric charge got reversed into a positive
one, with +16.7 mV, after the modification with an amino group (-NH2). Furthermore, it
again got reversed into a negative one, with around -29.6 mV, after the modification with
a carboxyl group (-COOH). Likewise, He et al. (2017) noticed that the nature of electric
charge from zeta potential of MSN reversed from around -23 mV to +23 mV after
modifying with amino groups. Similarly, in the study of Sun et al. (2019), the zeta potential
of MSN got reversed from around -22.6 mV to +24.3 mV after functionalizing with 3–
aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The APTES comprises an amino group (-NH2) as
a dominant group.
In our experiment, MSN was used to load the tacrolimus drug, and even after loading,
neither the zeta potential value nor the nature of the electric charge of MSN changed.
Thus, we can say that the encapsulating or loading process is different from modifying
or functionalizing process. In addition to these, modifying or functional groups present
over the surface of MSN will determine the nature and amount of charge. However, the
encapsulation process does not affect the nature or value of zeta potential at all.
50

5.4 MSNs and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complexes do not pose
any cytotoxicity to HUVECs
The in vitro cell viability calculation and the cytotoxicity effect were conducted for both
the MSN and the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex. In addition, the type of test used for this
experiment was WST-1 assay. Both the nanoparticles and the tacrolimus-loaded
nanoparticles were tested separately.
According to Paiva et al. (2020), there is no cytotoxic effect of both the MSN-APTES,
and the tacrolimus loaded MSN-APTES on ARPE-19 cells as the cell viability is more
than 80%. In addition, they have used below 100 mg/ml concentration of tacrolimusloaded MSN-APTES. In one of the researches of Zhang et al. (2021), it is found that the
MSN has no significant cytotoxic effect on both in vitro and in vivo cases. They have
used MSN with virus-mimicking nanoparticles. Likewise, bevacizumab nanoparticles
loaded with MSN do not possess any in vivo toxicity (Sun et al., 2019).
The cytotoxicity test of MSN, with the help of a cell-based assay, found out that there is
no cytotoxic effect of MSN on A549 cells (He et al., 2017) and MCF-7 cells (Kim et al.,
2021), even at a higher concentration such as 200 mg/ml. Furthermore, the cell viability
was more than 90%. However, there is evidence of cytotoxic effect with DOX loaded
MSN (MSN-DOX) on A549 cells, according to He et al. (2017) but not with MCF-7 cells
(Kim et al., 2021).
A study conducted by Harun et al. (2021) found that the ruthenium polypyridyl (Ru-PIP)
complex loaded MSN (MSN-Ru-PIP) was highly toxic to various cancer cells. In addition,
the doxorubicin and chlorin e6 loaded MSN with hyaluronic acid (MSN-HA-DOX-Ce6)
was significantly toxic to squamous cancer cells (Park et al., 2019). That is why toxicity
is also good in order to kill cancer cells properly. Furthermore, they termed this drug
delivery method as an ideal method to treat various cancers.
So, from both of our and other's studies, we can say that the MSN alone is not cytotoxic
when using lower than 200 mg/ml concentration. Similarly, the MSN-tacrolimusSpAcDex complex is also not cytotoxic till the use of 50 mg/ml concentration. Only a
negligible cytotoxic effect started to appear after using 100 mg/ml concentration of MSNtacrolimus-SpAcDex complex. The reason behind it might be the toxicity of both
tacrolimus and SpAcDex or either tacrolimus or SpAcDex, and it needs further study.
Thus, the MSN and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex are non-toxic but biocompatible.
Furthermore, the nature of the assay does not affect the result of the cytotoxicity test.

51

6. Conclusion
In summary, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), with pore size 50 - 80 nm and
MSN dopped Copper Sulfide nanoparticles (CuS@MSNs), with pore size 50 - 120 nm,
are synthesized successfully. Similarly, MSN shows a good tacrolimus drug loading
capacity as it absorbs a significant amount of drug tacrolimus, and it is approximately
63% when using a 1:5 ratio of MSN and tacrolimus. In addition, both the MSN and the
MSN-tacrolimus complex are stable as they have an average zeta potential of -15.1 mV
and -15.5 mV, respectively. Furthermore, this MSN-tacrolimus complex can be
encapsulated with SpAcDex polymer to form an MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex for
further stability. Moreover, these MSNs and MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complexes are
not toxic to HUVECs. Thus, MSN can be loaded with tacrolimus and encapsulated with
SpAcDex to target immune cells present in the patient’s kidney. This type of tacrolimus
delivery with the help of MSN@SpAcDex could be one of several methods to treat ESRD
effectively. Thus, MSN, along with SpAcDex, has a great potential as a vector or carrier
for different types of drugs in drug delivery methods.

52

7. Limitation of the study and Future work
The study was carried out to synthesize two different types of nanoparticles, viz., MSN
and CuS@MSN, and separately load drugs (tacrolimus and methylprednisolone) into
them, along with encapsulating with the SpAcDex polymer. In addition, it includes the
cytotoxic testing of these nanoparticle-drug-polymer complexes. During the study, the
synthesis of both types of nanoparticles was completed. In addition, the loading of
tacrolimus into MSN was also got possible, along with its encapsulation with the
SpAcDex polymer to form the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex. Moreover, the
cytotoxicity test of both the MSN and the MSN-tacrolimus-SpAcDex complex was also
completed. However, the loading of methylprednisolone into CuS@MSN and
encapsulating it with SpAcDex polymer, along with its cytotoxic test, were not possible
to carry out. The main reason behind this was the insufficient time as the project was big
enough for the master’s thesis. Besides this, the pandemic situation due to the novel
coronavirus caused the closing of laboratories and later restriction in Biocity building,
due to which doing experiments in Biocity building was not possible and increased the
whole study time. All of these made the pace of the project slow.
Thus, the future work of this study includes the loading of methylprednisolone into
CuS@MSN and encapsulated with the SpAcDex polymer to make CuS-MSNmethylprednisolone-SpAcDex complex. Furthermore, the cytotoxic assay of both the
nanoparticles and the nanoparticle complexes could also be done. Similarly, since the
WST-1 assay was carried out with HUVECs, another future work could be the carrying
out cytotoxic assay with the actual endothelial cells of the kidney. It will further clarify the
relationship between the endothelial cells of the kidney and drug-loaded nanoparticles.
