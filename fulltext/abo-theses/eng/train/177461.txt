Title: The role of marketing actions when new markets are being shaped: a study on edible
insects in Finland
Supervisor: Wilhelm Barner-Rasmussen
Abstract:
The world is constantly changing, and so are different markets. As markets are humanmade, one can argue that they also can be shaped with corresponding actions as to when
they were constructed. This thesis will investigate the process of shaping a new market,
focusing particularly on the field of edible insects in Finland.
The purpose of this thesis is to research how marketing actions have helped in shaping the
market for edible insects in Finland after it was created. The paper will examine why
Finland appears to be a forerunner when it comes to edible insects and how marketing was
used to shape the up and coming market. The theoretical part will focus on what a market
is and how a marketing strategy aids in the market shaping process and will further dive
deeper into the concept of market shaping. The methodological focus lies with edible
insects in Finland.
Companies can either carefully analyse the market and the direction it is moving in and
compile their marketing strategy accordingly, or they can act proactively and create a
strategy that will not only take the company forward but also develop the market. After
Finland decided to change the interpretation of the Novel Food Regulation by EU, it has
since November 2017 been legal to market and sell insects as food in Finland and, partly
because of the change in legislation, a new market has taken form. Insects have previously
not been a part of Finnish gastronomy, but this might change as the novel market is being
shaped. The thesis aims at answering how a new market is shaped after it has been created,
what the marketing strategy behind market shaping looks like, and how marketing actions
participate in shaping the market. Market making can be considered as one form of market
shaping, which is why both phenomena are recognised.
The empirical study is conducted with qualitative research methods by interviewing actors
in the field. A total of eight interviews supports the theoretical material and together aims
at answering the research questions of the thesis. The actors were chosen based on either
their activity in producing insect products for customers via their company or because of
their extensive experience in the field together with actively being a part of the market.
The interview results are first presented and analysed based on the main topics in the
interview guide being background, strategy, customers and competition, and then further
against the research questions first presented in the introduction. The results will critically
be examined based on the theoretical framework. Focus is placed on marketing actions and
market shaping actions.

Introduction

Markets are made by humans a can hence be changed and shaped by humans. Without human
action, there would be no markets and when companies acknowledge this, they can start
shaping the market in which they are active. The thought of markets as permanent and
something one must follow is outdated. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) The malleability of
markets has previously been researched by various names (see Kindström, Ottoson and
Carlborg 2018) and in this study, the concept will be referred to as market shaping.
Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (2016) define the market as either a physical or virtual space
where demand and supply meet. If there is no demand, or no possibility to purchase a product
or service due to, for example, no funding or a person being under-aged, there is no market.
This view supports the idea by Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) above that the market is
composed by people. Markets take form in various ways based on what the market wants or
is offered through added value (Kim & Mauborgne 2018)
Marketing actions are tied to the context the company is operating in and might as well
change and shift form as time passes. Consequently, a marketing strategy is not to be
duplicated and used in other conditions or for another company. (Maclaran, Saren, Stern &
Tadajwski 2011) Kotler, Armstrong & Parment (2016) continue that marketing strategies
support what is to come with the goal of a growing business. As a result, it might even be
preferable for companies to prepare for different fallouts in the future by addressing different
possible strategies. The marketing strategy is only a part of the more comprehensive
corporate strategy and is more detailed accordingly.
A traditional marketing strategy can, however, be seen as antiquated as it is focused on the
given market and written to adapt to the specific market in which the company is active. Yet,
if the market is not working for the company and the business is unprofitable a more
innovative approach might be beneficial in order to alter the market in the company’s favour.
That is to say, that the stagnated market as it is, is not preferable. (Nenonen and Storbacka
1

Tove Lindholm
2018) Marketing actions and strategies, that incorporates a will to shape the market are
proactive and focus on changing the environment the company is active in (Kindström et al.
2018). Mele, Pels & Storbacka (2015) continue, that simply by implementing marketing
actions a company is still supporting the market to change even if that is not the intention,
which is why a less prognostic strategy is preferred.
A market can also be shaped by smaller actors (Baker & Nenonen 2020), and as different
actions occurring in the market shapes it, the market should be seen as malleable (Kindström
et al. 2018). Even before a market is created, marketing actions are present in order to
examine consumers and developing a need (Araujo 2007). New markets are made by creating
added value to the consumer by solving a problem or discovering gaps in supply (Kim &
Mauborgne 2018).

1.1 Problem discussion
Sustainable development and climate change can no longer be considered simply a trend. For
humankind to fix the damaging choices made in the past, we need to work together both on
a global level and also as individuals. One way for individuals to reduce their carbon footprint
is to limit the amount of meat they consume and adopt a vegetarian diet. Meat counts for a
good source of protein in the human diet but is sustainably indefensible when mass-produced.
Hence, other forms of ensuring satisfactory level of protein through diet are being examined.
As stated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2013), the
population is predicted to rise to 9 billion within the next 30 years and hence, new solutions
to feed everyone are required. Edible insects are presented as one alternative to a modern
meat-based diet as insects contain protein and amino acids that humans require, but use less
feed than cattle, sheep, pigs and chicken (in that order) and emit fewer greenhouse gases.
(FAO 2019)
Many different solutions have been presented in Finland in recent years, and products related
to oat and horse been have risen to popular, easily acceptable articles (Stammeier 2017). In
November 2017, Finland changed the interpretation of the Novel Food Regulation by the EU,
and it has since then been legally approved to commercially sell insects as food (e.g.
2

Tove Lindholm
Sillanpää, 2017; Törmänen 2017). Edible insects are a superior source of protein compared
to meat or vegetable protein and use far less resources for producing the same amount of
protein. Insects are in many cases, mostly developed countries, considered vermin and
pesticides are created and used for considerable amounts of money. (Premalatha, Abbasi,
Abbasi & Abbasi 2011) But what if insects were used as food?
The problem, however, is that people are not accustomed to the thought of eating insects and
many think it is unconventional and even disgusting. According to Samuel Piha, in an article
made by YLE, the main reason for dreading insects is habits. In Finland, however, people
are more prone to experimenting with eating insects and are more positively set towards it.
(see Kahila 2017)
In this thesis, I have applied a method for defining the problem in which data sets the ground
for formulating the problem. This method is according to the “jigsaw puzzle approach” (in
Swedish pusselbitsansatsen) presented by Alvehus (2018). This approach starts with
gathering data by studying existing research and discovering unresearched areas to examine.

1.2 Purpose and research questions
This thesis explores the role of marketing in the shaping of new markets. I will research how
markets, in general, are being shaped and what it takes from a marketing perspective. This
thesis will further delve into how Finnish actors working with edible insects have proceeded
with creating and shaping the market. This is a completely new market area that has not been
legally active in Finland before 2017, which makes it interesting to examine the possibilities
and challenges. As the market for edible insects now is legal and it has been possible for new
companies to grow.
The intention is to map actions, especially marketing actions, taken by both companies
providing edible insects to the market and other actors in order to create the market
opportunity.

The problem this thesis aims to explore is what role marketing plays in the shaping of a new
market and what it takes to create a new market. I will specifically focus on the field for
edible insects in Finland. The market is still new and is hence being shaped as we speak.
This thesis aims to answer the following questions.
How is a new market created, and how is it shaped?
What is the company strategy behind shaping a market?
How do marketing actions contribute to market shaping?
With the research questions as a base, the theoretical framework has been assembled in order
to in the best way give a comprehensive view of the topic. By combining theoretical research
with a qualitative research method, the aim is to ascertain the research questions.
Based on the theoretical framework, the purpose is to research how marketing actions have
helped in creating and shaping the market for edible insects in Finland. I am searching for
answers specifically for this field but I am also interested in whether the results may be
implemented on other novel markets as well. I expect results that speak for the importance
of marketing in one way or another in market shaping. The reason for choosing to focus on
the market for edible insects in Finland is partly based on my personal interest in the topic,
partly because of the geographical area.

1.3 Delimitations
The thesis will be limited to Finland and the Finnish market of edible insects. I will further
demarcate the research to new companies in the field of edible insects and their story of how
they have made it to the point they are now. Due to the small size of the field, in addition to
company representatives, other experts with a strong influence on the field have been
interviewed in order to get a broader view of the process. Their valuable input in shaping the
market is important to understand the process. I have chosen not to include consumers in the
study as I wanted to concentrate on the business perspective, together with input by area
experts. Studying how users shape a market would require a study of its own (Harrison &
4

Tove Lindholm
Kjellberg 2016). The companies and experts have been handpicked as the most suitable for
this research and the research method has been narrowed down to qualitative interviews.

1.4 Methodology
The chosen methods for researching shaping a market focus on written material together with
interviews of actors in the field. According to Alasuutari (2011), previous empirical research
is to be analysed as clues rather than hard facts, and to acknowledge that they are always
conducted from a specific angle. One should study previous research critically and strive to
find the core behind the results.
The theoretical framework in this study concentrates on previous research regarding markets,
marketing strategy, market shaping, value creation, and entomophagy. The theoretical part
shall delve into the background of how a new market is shaped and what it takes to alter a
market, specifically regarding marketing actions. After that, I will examine the phenomena
of entomophagy and how it is perceived in western society. I will further focus on the market
in Finland and how the market has evolved, paying specific attention to marketing actions.
The research method chosen for this paper is qualitative interviews with companies and field
experts, highlighting the current situation, background, and future. The interviews were
conducted in January, February, and March 2020. As the sample and field of focus are small,
I will not be able to answer broader questions such as “how marketing affects marketing
shaping.” The method focuses on the field for edible insects in Finland which means that it
is a limited research area both in geographical size as well as sample target field. The
interviews focus on how the interviewees consider the topic content-wise, and they are not
analysed based on how the interviews express themselves. However, analysing the sample
from a broader perspective might enable new research results, but limits still need to be set
for the results to have a chance to allow for unexpected results. (Alasuutari 2011)
Altogether eight interviews were conducted for this study. Demographical restrictions were
not set regarding the interviewees, but they must all be either representing a company active
in the field for edible insects or experts of the said field. The companies were further chosen
5

Tove Lindholm
based on their business and the requirement was that they produce or have produced products
for the consumer market. For the interviews not to differ from each other, the same interview
guide was used for each interview situation. The structure varied depending on the
interviewee, but the aim was to cover the same topics with all interviewees. The interviews
were recorded and transcribed to accurately retell their answers. In chapter seven, the results
will be analysed from the perspective of the interview guide and in the following chapter
eight against the research questions.

1.5 Structure of the thesis
This thesis contains a total of nine chapters. The first chapter introduces the reader to the
topic and maps the core concepts. The introductory chapter consists of problem discussion,
purpose, and key concepts which shall be processed in the following chapters. The
introduction is followed by the theoretical framework which is divided into three parts. The
first theoretical part and second chapter outline markets and marketing strategies with a focus
on shaping actions. The third chapter introduces the reader to the concept of market shaping
and dives deeper into the topic. The fourth chapter presents entomophagy both in general and
how the practice appears in Finland and is the final part of the theoretical framework.
The chosen methodology is presented in chapter five, followed by empirical findings in
chapter six and data analysis in chapter seven. These chapters will in addition to present the
results also analyse the results based on the topics constructing the interview guide. Chapter
eight concludes the thesis and presents both theoretical and practical implementations as well
as suggestions for further research. In this chapter, the methodological results will be
analysed further in order to provide answers to the research questions. The thesis is completed
with a summary in Swedish in chapter nine.

1.6 Key concepts
Market is in this thesis referred to as somewhere, either physical or virtual, where demand
meets offer. (Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell 2016)

6

Tove Lindholm
Marketing strategy is here referred to as combining plans for upcoming marketing actions in
order to increase sales while keeping the customers satisfied in a chosen market. (Dibb et al.
2016)
Market shaping is in this document described as a phenomenon in which a player aims at
shaping a market to favour not only himself but the field as a whole. If the motive is to solely
benefit from the change personally, it usually is not a successful strategy. (Nenonen &
Storbacka 2018)
Market making is a more drastic form of market shaping and is here referred to when a
company not only moulds the market to fit its practice better but introduces itself or its
product somewhere where it has not been seen or consumed before. (Nenonen & Storbacka
2018)
Entomophagy is the definition of human consumption of insects (FAO 2013).

Strategic marketing

The following chapter will present the market, what it is and how it is defined and continue
to introduce marketing strategy the more traditional way compared to market shaping
strategy. Before examining marketing strategy, one needs to understand the concept of the
market itself as marketing strategies differ depending on how the company sees the market.
In the following section, a deeper view of a market is examined which aids in defining the
marketing strategy in the next subchapter.

2.1 What is a market?
The MOT Oxford Dictionary of English (2020) defines the market as “an area or arena in
which commercial dealings are conducted”. Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (2016) continue,
that a market is somewhere where sales of products or services take place. Previously, a
market has been a physical space to sell goods, but nowadays, it is more common to refer to
it as a geographical area or any physical or virtual space where there is demand and supply
for a product or service. In order to be able to call something a market, there are several
obligations that need to be met. The people representing the market, need to want the same
kind of product or service in order to create a big enough demand, and they must have the
ability to buy it, meaning that they have to have the funds, the desire to purchase it as well as
the legal right to do so. (Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell 2016)
Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) see markets as “complex adaptive systems (CAS).” As
defined as a complex adaptive system, a market is continually altered depending on actions.
Consequently, a market does not continuously keep the same stable shape and is not
something that needs to be adapted to. The authors further encapsulate the market as:
Markets are CASs of exchange for the creation of value, which includes use value to consumers. Markets
subsume industries and add multiple layers of designable elements. Rather than obeying ordinary laws of cause
and effect, markets constantly evolve from both emergence and deliberate design: deliberate shaping. (Nenonen
& Storbacka 2018: 27)

8

Tove Lindholm
According to Mele, Pels & Storbacka (2015), a market can either be defined as a verb or a
noun, which describes the different forms the word can take. These categories can then
further be divided into four themes being market entities and market representation under the
noun, and market performing and market sense-making under the verb. This concept offers
a way to examine markets in a complex manner. The themes are connected and influencing
each other, together creating a market specific for a certain field. By understanding these
themes and making them work for you, marketing can influence how markets are made and
shaped. (Mele, Pels & Storbacka 2015)
Market entities, involves all actors that a company needs to take into consideration when
planning their own business. The market here can be considered as the relationship between
the buyer and the seller, but in order not to exclude important aspects, the authors prefer
including the buyer-seller view into a bigger ecosystem in which possibilities are far wider.
Market representation describes the diverse ways in which a market can be portrayed.
Different market views, depending on from what angle the market is defined, can co-exist
simultaneously, even within a company. The different angles are represented by the specific
product that is being exchanged, and the wider view of the field beyond the physical product
that the company is active in. Market performing illustrates the various actions that a
company performs. For example, these actions can be transactions regarding selling a product
but can likewise be part of customer engagement over a long period. Market sense-making
describes the understanding of how markets are shaped and created, where product lifecycle
includes the proactive actions taken for market development and illustrates the part of a
market change that cannot be predicted. (Mele, Pels & Storbacka 2015)

2.2 Market view
According to Nenonen and Storbacka (2018), the market view can be divided into nine
distinct categories describing a poor and limited market view compared to a rich and integral
view. In this model, the limited market view is the traditional way of viewing markets, while
the integral market view is what the authors indicate would benefit companies more.
Traditionally, according to a limited market view, markets are seen as being defined
according to specific goods or industries, and that markets are provided and something a firm
must adapt to, compared to the integral view which defines markets as complex ecosystems
9

Tove Lindholm
that adapt according to activity by market players. The views also differ when it comes to
value creation; in a poor, limited market view value is created when the products are sold to
the customer as the trade itself is being made, whereas the integral view puts focus on value
co-creation together with the customer, meaning that value is created when a product
successfully creates meaning for the customer while in use. The latter focuses on creating a
product or service that the customer finds valuable after the purchase. According to this view
of value creation, the product is successful when it manages to both satisfy the customer and
engage her in reaching her goals by using that specific product. This is also an important part
of the marketing strategy used by companies; in a company with limited market view, the
company focuses on how it is located compared to its various competitors, whereas a
company with an integral market view follows a strategy that emphasises value creation both
for customer as well as partners of various kinds. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018)
Figure 1: Poor and rich market view

Reference: Nenonen & Storbacka (2018: 33)

10

Tove Lindholm
Another point where the views differ is when it comes to company goals and how to measure
success. For companies having a limited market view, goals are mainly set to finding
competitive benefts and advances are assessed according to how big a market share the
company has together with investor value. For companies having an integral view, the goal
is to constantly develop, and success is measured depending on value that is shared within
the ecosystem. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) This is supported by Kim and Mauborgne
(2018), who suggest that companies with a market making strategy focus on what they can
provide their customers more of, rather than cut the service and hence cost. This is backed
up by the thought that these companies do not think that customers necessarily always seek
for lower prices, but many times better service or a better product instead. By creating value
through better service or products, companies can attract a whole new customer segment that
would previously have been uninterested. This is done by widening the picture of the market
and, furthermore, shape the market.

2.3 Establishing a marketing strategy
According to West, Ford, and Ibrahim (2006), marketing, and hence marketing strategy, is
active on many levels within a company. From a marketing perspective, marketing is the
bridge between the company and its customers, acting on the demand set by the market in
order to manage goals set by the company regarding e.g. sales. On a business strategy level,
marketing proactively directs the company forward and is visible through the whole
organisation, creating a business advantage. Rogers (2011) continues, that in order for the
marketing strategy to succeed, the marketing department is dependent on the corporate
strategy and the resources given, which is why marketers should be present when the
corporate strategy is being developed to give observations of the market situation (see Kourdi
2011).
Dibb et al. (2016), define marketing strategy as
The selection of new opportunities to pursue and current activities to support, identification of associated target
markets and competitive positioning, and the creation of appropriate value propositions and customer

11

Tove Lindholm
engagement plans, in order to deliver the specified performance goals in the corporate strategy. (Dibb et al.
2016: 40)

A marketing strategy is a holistic strategy from the marketing perspective, including several
factors such as products, marketing activities and value creation, while striving to reach set
goals (Varadarajan 2009). Markets are man-made and hence something that also can be
changed by human action. Markets do not simply exist, but they are created and shaped
according to demand and ambition towards a goal. (Storbacka & Nenonen, 2011) Marketing
actions depend on how the firm perceives the market and can therefore differ between actors.
As Mele et al. (2015) define it:
If we view the market as customers, the marketing focus will be on managing those customers. If we view the
market as practices, the marketing focus will be on influencing market practices, and so on. This perspectivebased approach highlights the importance for managers to explicate their view of how markets work and what
the role of marketing should be within them. (Mele et al. 2015: 110)

Since companies need to plan for their future and develop strategies for business growth in
the correct direction, marketing should also be organised. Strategic planning includes
strategies to match the resources of the organisations with the possibilities the market
provides. Sometimes planning for different scenarios might be a good practice if the outcome
differs depending on, for example, upcoming legislation. When formulating strategies,
planning starts with the big picture; what is the main purpose of the company and in what
sense does it provide better or different service than competitors? When these questions have
been answered the strategy can be divided into smaller parts within the company, where
different departments can sharpen their strategies to align with the company goals. A
company needs to have a marketing strategy for every market it is present in or planning to
enter. The marketing strategy is more detailed than the company plan existing on the
corporate level and should provide researched reports on why marketing needs a specific
amount of resources. (Kotler et al. 2016). The marketing strategy is part of a company’s
bigger corporate strategy and hence, the marketing strategy must be in line and follow the
same outline as the corporate strategy. Important questions a strategy should answer are
where the company wants to be in a few years and what the markets should be, how to
12

Tove Lindholm
outperform competitors and with what kind of resources, as well as what does the
environment look like now and what might there be to come, and what targets and wishes
actors and stakeholders have. (Dibb et al. 2016) Marketing on a strategical level must
consider setting long-term goals over fast accomplishments and integrate contrasting values
such as analysis based on statistics together with softer aspects such as more artistic qualities
(Peppers & Rogers in Kourdi 2011).
Marketing actions depend on the specific context a firm is active in, and this can change over
time. Hence, the same model cannot be used for different companies, even in the same area
of business. Furthermore, marketing theory alone is not enough to declare the market or what
a market is as it does not hold all the answers. (Maclaran, Saren, Stern & Tadajwski 2011)
Since marketing acts as a direct channel between the company and the customer, marketing
actions are important for how the market turns out (Araujo 2007). A marketing strategy is
developed from a competitor strategy which runs on a higher level in the company. When a
competitor strategy has been drawn, the company decides upon what units to concentrate on
and marketing strategies are made for every unit. The units can change over time. (Parment
2008) Peppers and Rogers (2011) argue that when developing strategic marketing customer
trust is crucial for reaching success, and in order to succeed in that goal, the company’s
employees must also have trust in the company they work for (see Kourdi 2011).
According to Dibb et al. (2016), a marketing strategy includes several functions to operate,
and the marketing department offers advice regarding what opportunities to address and what
to be aware of by understanding the market. A marketing strategy needs to include various
aspects, such as understanding where the company currently stands and what should be done
to improve revenue and placement on the market, developing the strategy further as the
building blocks change. Furthermore, it should have a clear understanding of the target
customers as well as being able to communicate the core message and brand. The marketing
department also needs to evaluate how to keep existing customers and engage with them, and
how to attract new customers. These aspects must be managed, and the right team and tools
gathered for a successful implementation.

13

Tove Lindholm
When engaging in a marketing strategy, the firm will benefit from mapping the environment
it is or will be active in as an ongoing process. The marketing environment can be divided
into two spheres, the micro-environment and macro-environment. The micro-environment
includes all such actors that are close enough to affect the company in how it relates to the
customer. The macro-environment stands for the bigger picture and includes social structures
that affect the company from the outside. An example of such a structure is the ecological
footprint and sustainability addressed by the situation of our planet or technological
development. (Kotler, Armstrong & Parment 2016; Dibb et al. 2016)
Marketing environments change over time, and sometimes changes can be quick. Thus,
managers must stay focused and do their best in predicting what the future will bring.
Occasionally, companies fail to predict changes in the environment successfully which leads
to difficulties in comparison with competitors. Furthermore, marketing strategies should be
updated according to the changing forces in order for the company to be able to change
directions and refocus when needed. (Dibb et al. 2016)
Due to the lack of methods to trustworthy measure marketing actions, marketing has had a
slightly different position in economics. (Araujo 2007) One could argue, however, that this
is changing as marketing is digitalised and every click made by the customer or time spent
on a specific page can be measured. It is still difficult to say whether a customer decides to
finally buy a product because of marketing actions or not, but there are more methods
available now than there used to be. In order to be able to measure marketing actions, careful
planning is important. (Lavas 2016) Big data is being collected everywhere in bigger
quantities than has previously been possible to process. The development of ways to use the
collected data has enabled a leap forward on utilising the vast amount of data available. When
actors know how to utilise the available data, they can create value out of otherwise useless
data. A vast amount of value lies in the sort of data that cannot easily be conventionally
stored, such as noise, photos or videos, called unstructured data. (Barr 2015) With
digitalisation enabling data collection, also other forms of utilising digital possibilities take
form, for example machines and different technologies such as robotics. Since these new
forms of co-workers are getting more common, they contribute to creating value both for the
14

Tove Lindholm
company but also for the consumer. Companies also need to evaluate new forms of creating
value for their customers as innovative technologies and hence transparency blur the
traditional borders between the company and consumer. (Storbacka, Brodie, Böhmann,
Maglio & Nenonen 2016)

2.4 Summary
To conclude, markets can not only be defined but also viewed in diverse ways. For a market
to exist, there must be enough demand and supply to meet the demand. Moreover, customers
need to have the required funds to fulfil their needs and companies’ products or services that
matches the needs. Depending on how the company sees the market, the marketing strategy
will differ. Hence, a marketing strategy must be created for a company’s needs and not copied
from other company strategies. One can consider the market as stable where the company
adapts to the market and strives to outperform competitors in a limited market environment.
Another way is to view the market as integral, where the company by its actions can change
how the market appears. The marketing strategy is part of a company’s corporate strategy
and thus goes into more detail regarding for example how the company is perceived by the
customers and who the customers are. Since marketing environments transform over time
marketing strategies ought to take several scenarios into consideration in order to adjust in
an agile manner.

Market shaping

This chapter will dive deeper into the concept of market shaping. Building on the previous
chapter, in which markets and strategic marketing were introduced, this chapter will focus
on market shaping actions and what it means in a company strategy. Market shaping will
critically be investigated from different angles from a company perspective. The concept will
be elaborated upon in detail, dividing the themes in targeted sections for a comprehensive
overview, briefly connecting the theory to the field of edible insects in the following chapter.
First, a deeper overview of market shaping is presented, focusing on the definitions of market
shaping and how it differs from a more traditional approach. Then the chapter will continue
with focal subsections focusing more closely on the topic in detail. Finally, the chapter will
end with a summary.

3.1 Market shaping under the lens
Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) argue, that the traditional template that companies use when
developing their strategy is out of date. The traditional way of creating a strategy assumes,
that markets are stable and something that simply is, and that what has worked before will
work again. Market shaping however, is a new way of viewing strategy and may be used to
shape an already existing market or create a new market to fit the company. At the core of a
market shaping strategy is creating value for the customer when using the product or service
instead of measuring value as when the product exchange takes place (Nenonen & Storbacka
2018). This is supported by Kotler et al. (2016: 94) who argue that companies can either view
markets as given and unchangeable, or as opportunities that can be modified. Companies that
view markets as uncontrollable usually act according to what the market dictates and rather
watch things happen. They develop strategies that will keep them safe through possible
threats and ride on the possibilities provided. Another way of viewing the market is by being
proactive and shaping the market according to the company’s own needs. These are the
companies leading the way and creating opportunities for themselves, rather than waiting for
them to come. Companies actively engaging in a shaping manner are able to defeat negative
situations and create a successful environment that works for them. By being proactive,
companies can take action that drives them forward. Firms cannot shape everything,
16

Tove Lindholm
however, and certain environmental forces need to be respected. (Kotler et al. 2016) When a
market is being shaped, it usually requires a wide selection of actions taken by one or more
companies that eagerly strive to change the market. (Kindström et al. 2018)
According to West et al. (2006), companies would gain an advantage by questioning their
strategy and adopt a more innovative approach to gain success. To gain market share, a wider
view of the field is favourable and to challenge their view on what the market wants,
compared to what the market does not know it wants and solve it. Dibb et al. (2016) continue
that companies can perform in two separate ways when reacting to the marketing
environment. If they see the environment and the changes it might bring as something that
cannot be influenced, managers will keep a lower profile and keep to their original strategy.
However, if the marketing managers view the environment as adaptable, they will proceed
in a proactive way and strive to mould the market in a way that suits them. In the latter case,
the company will locate what obstacles need to be rigged, such as legislation or economic
factors, and proceed to overcome them. However, all environmental factors cannot be altered.
(Dibb et al. 2016) Expressing the company vision and giving voice to the shaping ideas,
engaging the whole network in the process and collaborate in order to work for the wanted
change and assist customers in the new environment are part of generating change. Promoting
activities are important as companies that have good intentions but do not know how to
express them, are not as successful in shaping the market. (Nenonen et al. 2019)
Market shaping includes both shaping an existing market as well as creating a new one.
Creating a new market is hence one form of market shaping. Market shaping is not directed
to huge corporations; small actors and even individuals can act as market shapers (Baker &
Nenonen 2020). Kindström et al. (2018) continue, that markets are constantly being shaped
by the various actions performed by market actors and a shift away from visioning the market
as stable and an environment that need to be followed is welcome.
Furthermore, Kim and Mauborgne (2018) continue that many companies are stuck with
traditional ways of viewing the market as something that is, including competition, and that
strategy must be built upon the main thought of growth happening at the expense of
17

Tove Lindholm
competitors. They call this traditional view the read ocean strategy, compared to the blue
ocean strategy, which is a market-creating strategy. For companies to make the switch from
a competitive strategy to a market-creating strategy, three key factors are essential. The first
one is to widen the spectrum of where new opportunities may lay and not solely focus on
what there is now. This means shifting the way of thinking and place the company in a new
light. However, it is difficult to make changes to one’s mind when lacking effective tools.
Hence, the second factor is to gain the right tools and perspective to ask oneself the right
questions that bring the company forward. The third factor is the human process which
focuses on how to inspire people through change and turn feelings of anxiety of the unknown
to creativity. (Kim & Mauborgne, 2018)
In order for markets to change, it often requires a play by multiple actors to either strive for
the same goal or as a result of independent choices shape the market that they are active in.
Shaping the market as a whole or making changes to the business usually go hand in hand
when it comes to market shaping and both lead to the market changing in one way or another.
(Baker, Storbacka & Brodie 2016) This is supported by Harrison and Kjellberg (2016), who
raise the importance of users in shaping the market. Users may not be the active driving force
behind market shaping but depending on the market in question, user activity might have an
impact of the shaping outcome.
It is, however, not as straight forward as ditching the old ways of doing business and taking
new strategies or processes into use. When making changes, research indicates that it is of
good practice to use both the old and the new processes at the same time for a while in order
to make different actors feel comfortable about the change and gradually move towards the
new strategy. Furthermore, introducing new innovations into the play might, in many cases,
require readjustments and concessions from the parties involved. (Koskela-Huotari,
Edvardsson, Jonas, Sörhammar & Witell, 2016) Driving through change and thus shaping a
market requires the support by top management (Kindström et al. 2018)
Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) present the model below for defining market shaping.

18

Tove Lindholm
Figure 2: Market shaping defined

Source: Nenonen & Storbacka (2018: 34)

What does not count as market shaping is when companies increase their market share but
otherwise stay the same. In this case, the market is seen as stable and something that
companies need to accustom to. When businesses enter a new market, it cannot either be seen
as complete market shaping as the market is still seen as stable and the company follows a
competitive strategy. Entering new markets might either mean that the company enters
another geographic area or starts to distribute a new, by the company previously not provided
product. However, when a company begins to improve a market that they are already active
in, it is called market shaping. Improving a market requires that the company sees the market
as something that can be shaped, and they follow a strategy that enables and provoke shaping
moves. A fourth scenario which also is viewed as market shaping with a twist, is when a
company creates a totally new market. This case requires more from the company than
making a small change to the strategy but might for instance, call for changes in infrastructure
and legislation. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018)

19

Tove Lindholm
Kjellberg and Helgesson (2007) argue, that dividing market practice in three categories
assists in analysing how markets evolve and change. They suggest three categories based on
how markets are being shaped in practice. The three categories are Exchange practices,
Representational practices, and Normalizing practices. Exchange practices include hands-on
actions such as marketing the product or service, logistics, and pricing. These practices
represent such actions that are directly associated with the business and marketing the product
or service. Representational practices describe actions that are more abstract than exchange
practices and aid in mapping the market and in what way it is changing. Representational
practices are used when a company seeks to update its market strategy or influence the
customers. Normalizing practices is a step further from representational practices as they
support in mapping in what way a market should be constructed. Normalizing practices
strives to change markets in a specific direction, although however, it usually is not possible
to predict what way the market finally will take. When all three categories are taken into
consideration, either one by one but preferably by interlinking them, market shaping practices
can be evaluated and different actions taken by stakeholders considered. (Kjellberg &
Helgesson 2007)

3.2 How does a market evolve?
As said earlier (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018), creating a new market is one form of market
shaping. Even though this study focuses on shaping an already existing market, this subchapter presents market creation to give a broad perspective to the topic.
The way marketing influences market creation is diverse and quite different from other
disciplines. It utilises psychology to understand the consumer; what the consumer wants, and
how to portray the product for it to be as attractive as possible. Marketing actions are active
before a market is created or shaped and combine social sciences with more tangible facts in
order to create a demand. This may lead to inevitably needed change in e.g. regulations and
hence, a more continual process. (Araujo 2007) Kim and Mauborgne (2018) continue that in
order to create a market and in that way strive for growth, a company can either use a
disruptive or a nondisruptive strategy. Being disruptive in this context means finding a
solution to a problem that a certain field has been trying to solve. The disruptive way of
20

Tove Lindholm
implementing this is by creating a new market at the expense of another. This means
entrepreneurially creating a new market with new jobs, but at the same time, sometimes
unintentionally, leading to the decline of another company or field and result in people losing
their jobs. The nondisruptive way of proceeding towards creating a new market on the other
hand, is by solving a problem no-one considered before. This is often done by creating a new
product or service that fits the demand well without jeopardizing or competing with another
field or company. The third option, situated in between the previous market-creating
strategies, is identifying an existing problem in a specific field and viewing it from a different
angle. In this way, one can come up with new solutions and accordingly create new markets.
This might attract customers from similar businesses and hence act as competition, but more
importantly, it might attract customers to the field that otherwise would not previously have
considered a product or service in the field at all. All these examples offer value to the
customer besides solving a problem.

Tove Lindholm
Market shaping takes time and the process can oftentimes take years instead of months.
(Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) This is supported by research conducted by Nenonen et al.
(2019) that reveals that market shaping actions oftentimes take many years to show results
which implies that market shaping strategies should be conducted for several years ahead.
Companies should not await major breakthrough shortly after starting their shaping process.
The same research also indicates that market shaping actions bring a positive effect on the
whole market including competitors, which suggests that companies should not fear to make
decisions that could benefit competitors and other actors as well. Kjellberg and Helgesson
continue (2007), that market shaping actions do not have an end and hence is a perpetual
process. If the process ends, it means that the market would stop existing. The market shaping
process might, however, take different turns and in that sense change direction which could
appear as an end to the process.
It might be difficult to know when a market is ready to be shaped. Shaping a market that is
already under some sort of turmoil is easier than trying to change a stable market. Right
timing is hence of utmost importance. One indicator of when the market might be ready is
when discussion is present regarding the need for change. The discussion can spin from a
crisis or accident that could be prevented or fixed by examining new solutions. On the other
hand, a likewise important factor in success stories regarding companies successfully shaping
a market is luck. Since one can never truly predict the future, anything can happen. (Nenonen
& Storbacka 2018) Sometimes downsizing in a specific market might be a considerable
option. If the field is not favourable the company could benefit more from redirecting the
resources elsewhere. (Parment 2008)
Kindström et al. (2018) recognise that a market shaping company, in order to succeed, must
create trust and validity by informing customers and partners and establishing a certain
demand for what the company offers. As important is focusing on the product and co-create
it with customers as it will simultaneously increase customer understanding. Finally, the
market shaping company need to understand its customers and partners as well as focus on
increasing competence in sales and marketing strategy to offer value.

22

Tove Lindholm
As in segmenting consumers into innovators, early adopters, or laggards (Rogers 1962), one
can divide companies in similar positions depending on when they decide to create a market
or shape it. One could argue that it is most useful to be the first to make a move. However,
the market might not be ready for the product just yet. It then takes time and effort for the
company to educate consumers on the new product. In this case, it might be easier to be the
follower company to enter when the market has been warmed up already. (Nenonen &
Storbacka 2018)

3.3 Shifting towards a shaping strategy
Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) argue that conventional marketing strategies within
companies normally plans for markets as if markets are something firms need to adapt to.
The authors indicate, however, that working with the market as given works well if the
market is cold, and the market as it is serves the company and business is good. Similarly,
though, if the company is struggling, a more disruptive way of planning might be profitable.
As Smith, Raspin and Smith (2008) present, markets need to be defined as complex as they
are constructed not by only one or two factors but a mix of many different components. Mele,
Pels & Storbacka (2015) emphasise the use of an unpredictable strategy for the same reason;
as companies take part in marketing actions, the market will shape, and new possibilities will
appear as a result. Another point of view is using the brand to influence partners and
consumers and hence shape the market. Nenonen and Storbacka (2018) assert, that the firm
can choose to be part of one or more markets, and hence, be part of shaping the
market/markets or place itself outside the market and adapt to whatever happens, as the figure
below indicates.

23

Tove Lindholm
Figure 4: From poor to rich market view

Reference: Nenonen & Storbacka (2018: 28)

When it comes to the required strategies for market shaping actions, Nenonen, Storbacka and
Windahl (2019) suggest that companies need to adopt a wider view of the actions needed.
Instead of concentrating on the goal of growing a specific market share, companies could
benefit from evaluating the possibilities of growing the whole market that they are active in.
In this way, the company has a greater chance of shaping the whole market and beyond.
According to Nenonen and Storbacka (2018), for a company to adopt a shaping strategy, it
needs to redefine or at least sharpen the market frame the business operates in. Before being
able to frame the market, the business definition needs to be clear. The executives should ask
themselves what it is that the company wants to achieve and in what business it wants to be.
The business definition and the market frame are connected; hence, the business definition
must be realistic and concrete. This, however, does not mean that the business definition
cannot include an ambition over where the company should be heading as well as an
explanation of where it is now.

24

Tove Lindholm
In order to manage a shaping strategy, Nenonen et al. (2019) suggest that companies should
focus on how to trigger change and how to facilitate it. Triggering change means evaluating
the company’s strategy and making adjustments that support change in the market, such as
calibrating customer support and focusing on innovative development.
Nenonen et al. (2019) were able to identify three unifying groups of capabilities for triggering
change, or market shaping, in a market. One group focus on exchange and describes actions
taken regarding i.e. product development, updating the pricing strategy, and evaluating how
for example digitalisation make matching providers and customers possible through different
platforms. The second group directs attention at networks and represents actions taken within
the network, for example providing customers support in using the product or targeting new
customers as well as encouraging competitors to enter the market. The last group,
concentrating on institutions, describes affecting language and media, and impact laws and
regulations likewise. A focal firm does not need to apply all triggering values if there is no
reason to do so and can hence choose when to use different capabilities.

3.4 Creating value
Mele, Pels, and Storbacka (2015), argue that by switching the view away from customers and
instead concentrating on the ecosystem as a whole, companies could find new ways to create
value. Furthermore, marketers need to focus on how the market could be altered in their
favour, or even create a new market based on their targets.
Value can be created through ecosystems and hence provide different sets of value for
different actors. When partners and competing actors decide to create an ecosystem with the
focus to create value, it starts with the actors actively collaborating at the same time as they
put competing to the side. This phase focuses on co-creating the ecosystem and space for
determining the networks’ joint strengths. During this phase, value is created but not as much
captured by the network. In the second phase, both value creation and value capturing are
strong when the partnering actors are collaborating and competing at the same time. This
phase demands sharing of resources as the collaboration otherwise is unbalanced and does
not create value. If that happens, the member companies are focusing too much on creating
25

Tove Lindholm
value for themselves, not for the ecosystem as a whole. In the third phase, the ecosystem is
strong, and the associates focus more on capturing value and leaving collaboration behind.
Important in this phase is that competing within the ecosystem should be modest compared
to competition outside the ecosystem. If the competition within the ecosystem between
partners is too strong, mistrust might take place. The fourth and last phase is the end of the
ecosystem path, in which the partners can either decide to close the ecosystem or make
changes for further collaboration. (Ben Letaifa 2014)
Figure 5: Creating ecosystems for value creation

In order to create value for the customers, the company needs to develop a suitable marketing
strategy that emphasises the customer role. As customers are many and different, the
company cannot focus on everyone and reach out to all with the same message or tactic. This
is done by segmenting the market and hence deciding on what customers to target, usually
based on geographical location, demographics, and psychological characteristics. (Kotler et
26

Tove Lindholm
al. 2016) As different technologies are being developed, they offer new ways of interacting
with customers. It is now easier than ever to be in touch more often, but this does not directly
correlate with customer satisfaction. There is a fine line between value and frequency, and
these two factors do not go hand in hand as value in some cases might increase with fewer
touchpoints and in other cases value is created through more and better interaction. (Sheth &
Sisodia 2006)
Previously, value has been thought to be created within the firm and then used up by the
consumer. This view has some limitations that need to be viewed more closely. According
to this way of evaluating value creation, value can only be measured by the price tag the
product or service has at the time of exchange. Furthermore, value creation has been thought
to be solely on the shoulders of the company and has not been mirrored on the market. This
view also emphasises that value is an economic factor based on a perceivable product and
that the market is made of the supplying company and the receiving consumer. When
studying the producer-consumer chain from a service-dominant angle, the limitations are no
longer valid as the boarders between different actors are not as clear. (Vargo & Lusch 2012)
Ottosson, Magnusson and Andersson (2019) propose a framework featuring value creation
in sustainable markets with market shaping intentions. Value is created through different
processes where value measured in money is only one aspect, together with presenting new
vocabulary and language as well as testing new solutions.
A product or service may not create significant value to the producing company, but on the
contrary, be of utmost importance for the user and hence the user will co-create value for the
product. Value can thus be defined as something that is created by and for the whole
ecosystem and does not need to provide the same sort of value for all. The socioeconomic
factors play an evidential part in creating and capturing value. The creating and capturing
parts are blurred as a stakeholder can create value but at the same time capture value created
by another player. (Ben Letaifa 2014) Moreover, market shaping often includes shaping
feelings and norms that have evolved over time. Consumers and competitors alike might be
used to acting or consuming in a specific manner or have never come across the new way of
thinking before. It will require some hard work to change perceptions and alter
27

Tove Lindholm
innovativeness in the field. Consumers are more likely to try a new invention, service or
product, whereas industry partners need to evaluate carefully as they have more at stake
which might entail a longer acceptance time. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018)
Since value is not solely created within the producing company and simply by exchanging
products or services, the value creation chain needs to be carefully thought of from different
angles. A product for example, will continue to create value for the buyer after the exchange
has happened. This means, that the buyer has to know how to utilise the product to reach its’
fullest potential. Hence, depending on the product or service, the providing company must
be prepared and willing to assist the buyer in any circumstances even after the exchange has
taken place. (Vargo & Lusch 2012) This might not create more value for the providing
company, but the value captured by the user or the ecosystem as a whole is far more
comprehensive. This in turns mirrors back to the creating actor and value is co-created within
the network. (Ben Letaifa 2014) Discovering value potential is done either by studying the
market and understanding how value is perceived amongst customers and other actors, or by
experimenting and influencing the company in trying out new ideas in order to get to a
positive outcome, even if it would be unplanned. Here it is equally important to emphasize
creating value instead of capturing value. (Nenonen et al. 2019)
Vargo & Lusch (2012) argue, in contrast to the accounting point of view, that a product that
has not been sold has no value. It might have economic value as it has been produced to a
certain cost, but if there is no one who would like to buy it, it loses the value. Hence, only
products or services that are sought after and wanted, have a value. By taking it further,
product or service providers cannot provide value per se, only propose value to the consumer.
If the consumer has no need for the specific product or service, she will not cocreate value
either.

3.4.1

Products

Companies can decide to grow in various ways. According to Kotler (2016), there are four
different alternative strategies for growth. One alternative is market development which
means identifying new markets for the products offered. It does not need to be a different
28

Tove Lindholm
country, but a more subtle change in customer demographics could do the job. In the case of
identifying a new geographical market, it is important to research both possibilities as well
as challenges. Another option for business growth is product development. This includes
developing new products in markets where the company already exists. A third option for
gaining market share is through pricing and advertising; by lowering prices, the company can
attract customers from competing companies without namely updating products. This is
called market penetration. The last alternative for market growth is diversification. This
means starting an activity in a completely new field in which the company has not engaged
before. (Kotler, 2016)
According to Bradley (2005), companies need to invest in innovating their products to
successfully compete on the market. The product needs to be what consumers want as well
as being different enough compared to competing products. New products need to be
innovated and the already existing products developed further. Parment (2008) continues that
a product often fulfils not only a primary demand (e.g., hunger) but also other purposes (e.g.,
sustainable living). By analysing the product thoroughly and why customers want to buy it,
the company will understand the competition better.
According to Mele et al. (2015), if companies perceive markets as based on products or
product categories and hence solely focus on products when building up their strategy, they
might unintendedly limit themselves. By focusing only on the products, a company can have
too a narrow a view and hence fail to recognize competition from other fields and fall short
on business opportunities. (Mele et al. 2015) At the point when psychology was applied as a
tool in marketing in order to understand what customers seek from a product, it was clear
that oftentimes it was more about lifestyle than for example, the products' external factors.
Hence, understanding this makes it easier for companies to influence customers in what they
want. In this sense, marketing has successfully combined various subject fields to reach a
goal. (Araujo 2007) When introducing a product to a new market, however, adjustments
usually need to be made. What interests a consumer in one market most likely will not do the
trick in another market. (Bradley 2005). Consumers can also be divided based on how willing
they are to try novelty products or services. Consumers who strongly relate to a specific
29

Tove Lindholm
company or brand might oppose new products entering the market, while consumers who
feel like they are being part of the change process are more likely to test a new product.
(Araujo, 2007) The way it has been for long is that products are produced for the developed
countries first where after they are introduced to developing countries. Often the large
companies are the force behind this phenomenon and hence the same products are being
spread worldwide. (Bradley 2005)

3.5 Networks
An important feature when shaping a market is the network of actors. When shaping a market,
or creating a new one, it requires a network of not only business partners and customers, but
also infrastructural partners in the form of for example legislation and media. Companies
striving to shape a market have the influencing role over key partners that it sees as crucial
for the upcoming success. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018). When new partnerships evolve, they
create new patterns which in turn sets the ground for novel markets. This starts either at a
grassroots level to then travel to upper levels regarding legislation or directly at the decisive
or company level which makes the spreading even faster. (Baker et al. 2016). This is
supported by Vargo & Lusch (2012), who continue that value is created within the network
and can be seen under loop as sharing resources with another actor or by uniting as a team
and shape the market as a whole. According to Nenonen & Storbacka (2018), market shaping
means that an actor intends to shape the whole market in the favour of many actors and thus
improve the market. Changing a market with the motive of only benefitting personally, will
not work in the long run. Shaping a market requires different actors who are positive towards
redefining their role in the new market. Particularly if a new market is being made, actors
need to be at ease with unclear roles and definitions. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018)
Marketing actions require a team of players, preferably with people with different skill sets
collaborating to achieve the best result. This means not solely from the company side but
also other actors such as merchandisers and retailers. (Araujo 2007) Partnering up with others
within the company as well as outside the company alleviates the goal of creating value for
the customer by streamlining the process and being able to offer a hassle-free delivery chain.
When collaborating with different departments within the same company, it is important to
30

Tove Lindholm
maintain an open dialogue so that all parties are heard and taken into consideration. The role
of the marketer is keeping the focus on the customer and the experience provided while not
compromising, for example, the budget. (Kotler et al. 2016)
Before starting the market shaping journey, the company must distinguish its main partners,
being not only the closest providers or buyers but also actors far down the line being, for
example, customers’ customers. The company needs to take into consideration who these
actors are, what they provide and what other products they use that relate to the specific
market. Other important features to contemplate are how the different actors relate to each
other and whether all actors are necessary for the future market to come. Sometimes when
markets are being shaped, not all actors from the past might be the right partners in the future.
Hence, companies need to re-evaluate their network frequently in order to examine new ways
of working and finding new business opportunities. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) By
including new partners in an innovative renewing process within a service ecosystem, it adds
diversity to the process which in turn eases the change (Koskela-Huotari et al. 2016). Ben
Letaifa (2014) argues, that moving from a competitive approach between companies with
creating value for the specific company itself, towards a viewpoint in which value is created
within the ecosystem, is difficult. Actors who have been competitors before will not
automatically behave as collaborators immediately even if they strive for an ecosystem for
networking with each other. Factors that ease the transition towards a more collaborative
partnership are clear thoughts on where to head with the ecosystem, in other words gathering
a coordinating managerial facet to keep focused on the goal. Other factors to consider when
striving for a collaborating ecosystem are embracing the community in order to keep the right
mindset and all parties involved.
When shaping a market, the company might need to help educate both business partners as
well as customers. If introducing a new product causes mainly confusion, the product
provider might benefit from taking over an educating role. This will in the long run, help
customers and partners adapt to the new product and way of using it, as well as adopt the
product as a normal piece in their everyday life. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) This is
supported by Kindström et al. (2018) who emphasise the importance of, on the one hand,
31

Tove Lindholm
creating a demand for the offered product and, on the other hand, create trust on the market.
One is stronger together and unlike doing changes alone, affecting the market and targeted
actors is more successful when striving for the same goal.
In addition to a network of actors, creating or shaping a market often involves new
terminology which needs to be adopted by the market. This is most successfully done by
educating actors in the new area which creates a coherent approach. By shaping the market
but keeping it similar to existing markets eases the process for consumers and other actors to
grasp the new concept and to either try the product out or be involved in a partnering role.
(Baker et al. 2016) This is supported by Nenonen et al. (2019), who suggest that companies
active with a market shaping strategy benefit from not only increasing their own share but
instead gain positive impact by improving the whole market. This will also help competitors,
but the gain is mutually bigger and results in an outcome that is better for all. Moreover, the
authors emphasize that a shaping company needs to communicate with other stakeholders
such as customers, competitors and partners in order to influence the network with for
example new vocabulary or events. In these cases, value is created within the network and
distributed to everyone involved. This is supported by Gavetti, Melfat & Marengo (2017),
who indicate that shaping actions may have an impact on competitors in the field, but also
indirectly on the focal firm. By making changes to the market, it will affect other actors which
in turn will echo back to the shaping company as the network and business environment
changes. In environments that tend to change quickly, shaping strategies need to be handled
with care as the market might otherwise be “overshaped”. This might happen if many actors
are working on shaping the market and hence alter the market in a way that makes it unstable.
However, if the actors on the other hand are part of a connected network and thus working
for the same goal, they might reach the change they strive for even though many stakeholders
are involved.

3.5.1

Communication

When shaping a new market, the company needs to think about how they interact verbally.
What sort of names are being introduced and in what way is the new product or products
being communicated about? It is important to create a name for the company or product that
32

Tove Lindholm
is easily accessible, both for the customer but also for competitors. When shaping or creating
a market, ready-to-go words might not exist. Hence, it is up to the pioneers to let their
creativity flow. As an important complementary angle, also the visual and statistical side is
equally fundamental. Media and marketing agencies handle this with grace, but in most cases,
many companies do not use a different kind of depictions well enough. When naming a new
product or even a company, the name needs to be catchy and informative. A great name
works in the company’s favour and helps boost sales. If the name nor the product is not
interesting enough, the novelty product might not succeed. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) If
the product, however, becomes so popular that the name is referred to as the thing itself, it
might be slightly difficult (e.g. the zipper or trampoline, see Shontell 2010).
According to Mele et al. (2015), marketing has a greater possibility in influencing an already
existing market or the creation of a new market, by understanding the whole ecosystem
around markets. This, in turn, aids in creating value when the focus is not pointed at a single
area. For example, by creating a specific language for partners, customers and institutions to
use, marketing aids in creating new business opportunities as well as providing terminology
for novelty products or services. Ruskin-Brown (2006) continues, that one of the main
challenges in marketing communication is successfully informing customers of the value a
products offers when customers lack sufficient information.
Introducing a completely new product means familiarising consumers with something that
they are not used to. Companies need to evaluate how to make the novelty product
approachable for the audience and a part of their everyday life. This can be achieved, for
example, by using phrases or other visuals that people are already used to and hence
promoting a feeling that the product is meant to be or has always been. (Nenonen & Storbacka
2018) Pearson and Zehr (2011) emphasise the potential in Pre-commerce and market through
customers. This applies mainly for social media marketing and a company can strive to
identify core customers who can act as influencers for a product or the company. The
company also needs to create good content for sharing within the network of influencers and
customers.

33

Tove Lindholm
Besides using language for communicating the name and use of the product, connecting with
customers through information is crucial when shaping a market (Nenonen & Storbacka
2018). The marketing department needs to include various aspects when communicating in
order to create a comprehensive impression of the company (Blythe 2009). Moreover,
communication continue to be important after the customer purchases a product as when
customers call for confirmation for their purchase (Ruskin-Brown 2006). Media is
convenient as a tool of reaching out to a big audience. However, media in general are for
profit-actors and are hence investigating opportunities to obtain as many views as possible.
Media has the potential to influence what people see, although not what they should think. It
is also up to the media producer to decide on what and how it is displayed. Thus, a market
shaping company most likely wants to influence media on publishing news that would benefit
the market. Another powerful method of reaching out through informative channels is by
providing statistics of the market or how the product could influence the user or environment.
(Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) Nowadays, when the use of social media and other digital
channels is common,
To raise awareness, diverse kinds of events might prove useful. Moreover, events and other
PR occasions attract media, which is a solution where everyone benefits. If the current palette
of events goes hand in hand nicely with the novelty product, the company might take
advantage of these. Otherwise, creating innovative marketing actions is a way of making
noise and invoke interest. (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018) However, Kim and Mauborgne
(2018) point out that when making changes to the strategy and taking part in market shaping
actions, a modest start can be recommendable. If taking off too loudly and for example
launching a product in many locations at once, possible flaws are more difficult and costly
to fix. Furthermore, if the media have been interested in the companies’ actions and
additionally report possible failures, customers might react negatively. Thus, the authors
recommend starting smaller scale, investigate how the action is perceived, fixing possible
errors and to magnify when the product or service is tested.

3.6 Competition and regulation
When customers have the possibility to choose between different product or service
providers, it means that there is competition. Companies then need to think about their unique
advantage in the market and what they can offer the consumers that makes them different
from their competitors. What brings the customers value and what do they need? To create a
strategy, research must be done in order to have a clear picture of what players act as
competitors. A marketing strategy also needs to include the advantage that the company has
in comparison to competitors and in what way it can offer something that others fail to do.
(Kotler et al. 2016) For a market to develop, it quite often requires competition. Competition
allows for consumers to assess similarities and differences between two or more players,
which in turn adds value to the market. One player is weaker than two, and two players are
weaker than three when it comes to developing a market. As an example, reaching out to
potential customers through marketing is much more efficient when several companies
promote the same sort of products, although the products are competing. The knowledge
carries further when there are more actors making noise about it. (Nenonen & Storbacka
2018) As for companies to tackle competition, it is essential to know the competitors. The
company should research what the competitors do and in what way they offer value to their
customers. By knowing the competition, the company can evaluate what they can do
differently or how they can improve as well as knowing what the competitor cannot do.
(Kotler et al. 2016)
It is however possible for companies to both compete and collaborate simultaneously (Baker
& Nenonen 2020). Competition is best utilized when combined with cooperation. The
benefits of both competing and cooperating are various. By competing, companies strive for
better products and outcomes which may not be required solely by customers. Developing
new products might be needed simply to stand out and to interest customers in comparison
to the competitor. On the other hand, by cooperating, both or all companies can join forces
and profit from each other. Through cooperation, companies can focus on their core business
and still, together with the competitors, offer a wide selection of goods to the customers.
Furthermore, by working together towards the same goal, companies can gain reputation
more efficiently and make themselves known in the market. (Bengtsson & Kock 2000) Kotler
35

Tove Lindholm
et al. (2016) argue that competition nowadays is not solely between single companies but
between whole chains of production. A company with great products might lose to another
company with poorer supply but a stronger supply chain.
As an example of changing markets and hence, changing competitions, the movie and series
providing platform Netflix announce that their biggest competitor is sleep. People lack time
and if it was not for sleep, Netflix’s customers could partake in the wide selection of movies
and series at a whole different level. (Hern, 2017)
Interacting with competitors can be handled in various ways, but different studies show (i.e.
Bengtsson & Kock 2000), that a mix of collaboration and competing with competitors, gives
the best outcome when it comes to business growth and creating value. Coopetition is a gentle
blend of collaborating and competing, and it depends on the companies involved and their
situation to what degree the relationship is competing or collaborating. A coopetitive
relationship needs to be handled with care as the companies involved in this kind of affiliation
have both conflicting and connecting interests. (Bengtsson & Kock 2000). When networking
within an ecosystem, Ben Letaifa (2014) argues that for the ecosystem to be successful, a
coordinator or group is needed to lead the network forward. This role is important in order
to keep focus and maintain the vision clear in mind amongst the actors. It also assists in
creating affinity between members and hence derive a feeling of mutual respect and
aspiration to work for the same goal.
In the market for edible insects in Finland, Arppe, Niva and Jallinoja (2020) argue that up
until the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry revealed that the EU Novel Food Regulation
is going to be construed more permissibly in Finland, the Ministry had been perceived as the
actor against which all other actors were opposing. This position enabled the other actors
(producers, retailers, enthusiasts) to join forces and hence collaborate for the same goal. The
authors indicate that collaboration between the early actors might not have been a reality if
the authority hindrance would not have been there, and what is more, acting as a network
creator.

36

Tove Lindholm
Shaping or making a market often means dealing with regulations, standards, and legislation.
Actors striving to introduce a new product and hence create a new market or shape an already
existing one may strive for changes or updates in the law to enable their product (Baker et al.
2016) Following a market shaping strategy means striving to either loosen up regulation to
enable different forms of business or creating more regulation with a stabilising intention.
Changing regulations as a single company might be difficult as regulators do not want to be
perceived as affirmative towards a specific actor. Thus, teaming up with a network of players
striving for the same outcome is preferable. This can also be done by activating the
customers, meaning the demand by consumers is great enough to change regulations in their
favour (Nenonen & Storbacka 2018).
Regarding edible insects, not all Europeans have the same opportunities to try out insects as
the legislation differs. In the EU, insects are part of the Novel Food Regulation (2015/2283)
and it includes the whole insect, including for example legs and wings. Novel food, according
to the Novel Food Regulation, is foodstuffs that have not been part of a typical diet or
consumed vastly in the European Union before 15 May 1997. Food that is covered by the
regulation include products that have been consumed outside the EU as well as food produced
in an innovative way or by a new process. The new Novel Food Regulation replaced the
previous version as of January 2018. The main changes to the previous version are digital
updates to the processes and data protection. (European Commission 2018) With the update
of the regulation, also the use of insects as food was clarified. (Maa- ja metsätalousministeriö,
a)

3.7 Summary
Market shaping is an innovative marketing strategy, where the company may utilise societal
transformation as leverage for shaping the market. Market shaping includes making changes
to a market where the company by the time is present by developing it, as well as creating a
new market. Offering a solution to a problem or introducing a new product to aid market
difficulties or demand are examples of shaping actions. At the core of market shaping is
creating value throughout the whole ecosystem, including the network of customers, partners,
competitors, shareholders, and stakeholders. A market is challenging to shape for one actor
37

Tove Lindholm
alone, why collaborating with competitors and partners is to prefer. However, a combination
of collaboration and competition, called coopetition, within a network of actors striving
towards the same goal has the chance to reach the goal of a shaped market more efficiently.
Shaping or creating a market requires the strategy to consider introducing new vocabulary to
communicate with actors and customers, influence regulation, and choosing the right time to
make the required manoeuvres.

Entomophagy

Entomophagy is the definition of eating insects. It is not used only for human consumption
but for other creatures too, such as birds and other insects. Insects have been eaten by humans
through history and are not something new in that sense. There are several different edible
insects worldwide and the most popular ones are crickets and grasshoppers, beetles,
caterpillars, bees’ wasps and ants among others (FAO 2013; Raheem, Carrascosa, Oluwole,
Nieuwland, Saraiva, Millán & Raposo, 2017). The International Platform of Insects for Food
and Feed announces, that the world population is estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050, which
stresses the importance of finding innovative solutions for catering for people’s needs for
food. Approximately 2,5 billion people worldwide are already consuming insects in their
diets and insects can, in addition to the human diet, be introduced as animal feed to a wider
extent in the future. (IPIFF 2020)
Belgium and the Netherlands are often seen as example countries when it comes to
introducing insects to the everyday lives of their citizens. Belgium introduced insects as one
of the early countries in Europe and is hence often referred to (Belluco, Halloran & Ricci
2017). In the Netherlands, insects have been introduced in the form of alternatives for meat.
Products were for example nuggets made of insects and other familiar ready to eat meals.
Some of the problems faced by the company, Insecta, was that their products were perceived
as too expensive and difficult to get as they were accessed mainly through big grocery stores
accessed by car. (House, 2018)
Although consuming insects as food is common worldwide, it is not popular in Europe.
Compared to the rest of the world, Europeans mostly find eating insects as slightly disgusting.
In order to normalise consuming insects as food, different strategies have been tested broadly.
These include reaching out to the younger population and educate about edible insects at an
early age, add insects into other food products that people are already familiar with and
develop them further to increase willingness to try. Other strategies are amending the taste
for the better, taking advantage of known actors in promotional actions, equip consumers
with related knowledge to accept insects as a source for good quality nutrition and inform
39

Tove Lindholm
where insects can be bought and how they should be consumed. (Raheem et al., 2017) On
the contrary, House (2018) argues that when implementing insects as a new part of the diet,
the insects should not be hidden away but more so emphasized as one of the main ingredients.
He continues that for consumers to choose insect dishes before something more traditional,
they need to feel a positive reward and reason to do so. Otherwise, it is easier to continue as
before.
It is equally important to emphasize the environmental aspect of consuming insects compared
to meat and to amplify the benefits regarding the future dilemma of a growing population
(Raheem et al., 2017; van Huis, 2013) Premalatha, Abbasi, Abbasi, & Abbasi (2011)
continue, that insects are not only more efficient in turning feed into animal protein but are
also a sustainable addition to income for people. In conventional agriculture, insects are
considered pests and something that must be erased. However, insects consist of around 75%
of protein compared to grain and vegetable crops that consist of 14% protein at best. Insects
are hence an untapped resource in battling global food scarcity and adjustments should be
made to turn insects into an advantage and more commonly utilised. In most cases, insects
also hold more nutrients than meat or vegetable protein sources.
If the goal is to make insect as normal a foodstuff as anything else, it must be made easily
available to purchase. This is especially important in the early stage when insects most
probably are more expensive than the more traditional alternatives. In a Western society
where insects have not been consumed before, it is difficult to add insects into the diet as
they do not replace any other ingredient as it is. Hence, it is problematic to add them to
already existing products or recipes. (House, 2018) Collins, Vaskou and Kountouris (2019)
continue, that so far, no specific marketing strategy has been proven more successful than
another, and that a combination of different marketing activities needs to be used for different
markets. There is room for product development as well as price adjustment.
For a novelty food such as insects, to be adopted into the diet of people, it benefits from being
part of some specific usage rather than simply being a stand-alone product. Since insects are

40

Tove Lindholm
something that Europeans are not used to cook with, even the most open-minded consumers
do not know what to do with them. (House, 2018)
Rather than striving for a comprehensive acceptance of eating insects as they are, a more
successful strategy would be to add insects to food that already is accepted in the market
(House, 2018). In order to further promote entomophagy, there need to be further research
conducted upon the nutritional value of insects, as to assure consumers of the health benefits.
Research also need to focus on rearing insects with the purpose of enabling a comparison to
more traditional ways of farming food. Another important future aspect is the economic
benefit, as farming insects may provide an income for people in the future as well as an
alternative source for protein. (FAO, 2013)

4.1 Edible insects in Finland
Many of the first Finnish start-up companies who started producing edible insect as human
food before it was legally accepted were inspired by the FAO report. Moreover, the strong
start-up environment in Finland acted as pushing factors together with wide media coverage.
In Finland, the discussion around edible insects was mainly focused on a human diet, not on
feed for animals. In the beginning, the Finnish companies started with house cricket as the
main insect. Insects, supply and expertise were ordered from the Netherlands. The reason
behind choosing the house cricket was the thought that it would be the easiest to start with,
that consumers would adopt the house cricket easier than other possible options. At the start,
the companies did not differ massively from each other. (Arppe, Niva & Jallinoja 2020)
Growing edible insects is not particularly difficult, at least if it is kept at a small scale. Insects
are also easy to refine into other products. As the field has gotten media coverage during the
last years, it might have had an impact on how many new producers have gotten involved in
growing and producing edible insects. (Heiska & Huikuri 2017) Arppe, Niva and Jallinoja
(2020) continue that Finland is a special case regarding edible insects in the sense that the
country is small, and a few start-ups started producing insects before the change in legislation
when the future was still unsure. Furthermore, media took an active role in communicating
41

Tove Lindholm
changes and prospects and hence aided in bringing out the knowledge for the new form of
foodstuff.
In Finland, producing insects for human food became legal in November 2017 (Sillanpää,
2017). Directly after, in the end of November, Fazer launched their cricket bread, which
created a hype world-wide. The bread and the marketing campaign around it even won the
third price in the Sustainable Development Goals series at the Cannes Lions competition in
the category of Responsible Consumption and Production. (Fazergroup 2018) Moreover,
Arppe et al. (2020) continue that the environment for edible insects in Finland took off with
a considerable network of actors from different fields. The network consisted of research
centres, universities, media, distributing companies, individuals interested in the topic,
international reports, and authorities. Influences were taken from abroad and adapted to the
Finnish scene. Before the change in legislation, the authorities were the ones who were
restrictive in their approach towards insects as food. The media coverage, on the other hand,
was mainly positive.
The consumer price for edible insects has so far been high, and Heiska and Huikuri (2017)
have in their report analysed the root cause to be the small specialty market that edible insects
represent. They continue, that edible insects can be categorised as artisan food which affects
the price together with the small scale, often hand-made, production. (Heiska & Huikuri
2017). In Western countries a rule of thumb is to have less visible insects in the product and
focus on enlightening consumers about the new ingredient. As more consumers become
accustomed to insects as food, the general feeling of disgust towards eating insects might
fade over time. Targeting children at this point and familiarising them with insects is worth
taking into consideration in order to improve future perceptions towards edible insects.
(Collins et al. 2019)
One of the biggest changes in the market for edible insects in Finland has so far been the
change in legislation (Heiska & Huikuri 2017). The main reason for the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry of Finland to accept insects to the foodstuffs market was that edible
insects had raised interest among both consumers and companies. Insects were in Finland
42

Tove Lindholm
sold as i.e. kitchen decoration and eye candy which meant that the product, even though
consumed as food, was not under the Ministry’s food control. By interpreting the novel food
regulation by the European Union to include insects as food, insects can be monitored by the
food supervision division and involve the Finnish Food Authority in the control. (Maa- ja
metsätalousministeriö b 2017)
According to Arppe et al. (2020) the different actors who were active in the goal of getting
insects accepted as human food used different strategies to achieve this goal. The most
common strategies were publicity in media, testing the product, and eating the product.
Media publicity was created partly by the actors themselves, by contacting journalists and
insofar, sparking the public interest. Promoting insects as food intrigued other media
personalities and the hype was on. Product testing as a strategy on the other hand, happened
through both informative events and providing products to retail stores. When it was still
against the regulations to sell insects as human food, all events and products had to use words
that did not refer to people eating insects but preferably experiencing them. The third strategy
used was openly offering people to eat insects. This happened through events such as the
Helsinki Night Market, where crickets were sold as “non-food” and through individuals
organising events, as the legislation did only apply to commercial activities. (Arppe et al.
2020)

Methodology

This chapter will present the methodology of this thesis. The chapter will commence with
presenting the concept of research design and trustworthiness of a study. Furthermore, I will
introduce different research methods and arguments for why I have chosen a qualitative
research method for this study. Finally, the chapter will end with presenting the data sources
and how the data has been collected A table with the interviewees is presented and a brief
introduction to why they were chosen for this study.

5.1 Research Design
Bryman & Bell (2015) define the research design as “A research design provides a framework for
the collection and analysis of data”.

For the research to be clear and easy to grasp for the reader, a clear focus, and hence design
is crucial. A good research design stems from well-articulated research questions which give
the study its base. By having a thought-through design, it keeps the research neat and on
track. Furthermore, a good research design assists in connecting the theoretical part with the
methodology and illuminates the core of the research. Nevertheless, the research design
needs to be flexible enough to handle changes if the process so requires. (Flick 2007)
For this study, I have chosen to follow a case-based design and interviewing actors in the
field of edible insects. In a case-based design focus is put on understanding the separate cases
wholly and recognising differences in mindsets and situations (De Vaus 2005). The study is
explorative in nature and seeks to understand the chosen field of edible insects, but also looks
for broader signs of actions for market shaping as a whole.

5.2 Research Method
Qualitative research, compared to quantitative research, utilises text or spoken language as a
data source and the used method needs to be flexible to capture the perspectives of actors
involved (Flick 2007). This is supported by Bryman and Bell (2015); however, they continue
that qualitative and quantitative research are different research strategies. The differences
44

Tove Lindholm
between these research strategies are that a qualitative research strategy focuses on language
and creating theories, whereas a quantitative research strategy focuses on measuring theories.
Qualitative research, in contrast to quantitative research, further underlines social differences
and gives more room to the individual view instead of certain models.
The theoretical framework defines what kind of data should be collected and how (Alasuutari
2011). Qualitative research requires the researcher to be neutral to a realistic extent; however,
as the empirical data is gathered it will be analysed by the researcher who will evaluate the
data according to her ability and the purpose of the study (Flick 2007). Depending on the
purpose of the study, the data can be analysed either from a content perspective or by
analysing also interaction in detail. A recorder is the most trustworthy device for analysing
spoken language, yet it fails in communicating body expressions and nonverbal
communication. (Alasuutari 2011)
For this thesis, I have chosen to use the qualitative research method. The main reason behind
the choice is that I found it interesting to gather the individual voices of different actors
involved in the field and have the possibility to dig deeper into their answers and thoughts. I
consider the qualitative research method suitable for this thesis, to understand how the market
for edible insects has been formed and shaped, what the strategy behind shaping a market is
and how marketing has been involved in the process.

5.3 Trustworthiness of the study
According to Bryman and Bell (2015), the three most important aspects of business research
methods, are reliability, replication and validity. Reliability represents whether the study can
be re-made and obtain the same results repeatedly. This measure is especially important in
quantitative research where the results should not change regarding on who conducts the
research. Replication, the second aspect presented by the authors, means that the study
conducted needs to be documented in detail to such a degree, that someone else can conduct
the same study later if so need be. Validity represents whether the study actually measures
what it was supposed to, and whether different factors such as time and place influence the
result, or if the same study can be conducted in a different field.
45

Tove Lindholm

This is supported by Daymon & Holloway (2010), who present three alternatives for how
research can be trusted. These are the traditional perspective, the alternative perspective, and
the radical perspective. The traditional perspective suggests that research, both quantitative
and qualitative, needs to be evaluated the same way by “validity and reliability”. The
alternative perspective proposes that when conducting qualitative research different
measurements should be used as opposed to qualitative research and used the terms
“trustworthiness and authenticity”. The radical perspective suggests that the research
conducted should be evaluated regarding what is most natural for the study or common within
the field and hence not compared to other studies with different criteria. They further
recommend that the alternative perspective should be used especially if the author is new to
research. Bryman and Bell (2015) points out that reliability, replication, and validity often
seems to apply more for quantitative research rather than both quantitative and qualitative
research methods.
Trustworthiness in qualitative research is measured by confirmability, credibility,
dependability and transferability. For confirmability to be achieved, the purpose is compared
to the conclusions and how well they match, in order to show that the conductors’ own
thoughts have not been mixed up with the results. Dependability means that the findings are
accurate and that the reader easily can follow the path and make entitled conclusions.
Credibility is achieved when the reader, regardless of their positions, can follow and
understand the findings and what the research strives for. Transferability means assisting the
reader in transferring the knowledge gained from the study to other fields, even though the
study might contain a restricted and small sample of respondents. (Daymon & Holloway
2010)
As the possibility to remake the study completely is limited, it will affect the quality and
dependability. It might prove impossible to reach the same interview objects, the content of
the interviews might be affected by time and progress in the area in question, and the
researcher generally influences both the collecting of data as well as analysing it.

46

Tove Lindholm
(Denscombe 2018) Flick (2007) continues that in order to achieve quality in interview-based
qualitative research, an interview guide will assist in capturing the core for each interview.

5.4 Interviewing
The interviews are constructed based on the theoretical framework, made specifically for the
research in question (Lantz 2007). Although interviewing as a qualitative method is common,
it is still a lengthy process, including preparations, the interview itself, transcribing and
analysing the results (Bryman & Bell 2015). In order for an interview to be professional, it
has to reach up to certain demands. The interview must provide trustworthy results, the
results must be valid, and it must be possible for others to check the conclusion critically.
(Lantz 2007) Interviewing as a method may be used when the researcher strives to research
convoluted phenomena and gain deeper knowledge on a specific question. Moreover,
interviews are a good approach when the goal is to target specific interview objects who have
insightful information about the research problem and when the researcher strives to
understand the problem profoundly. (Denscombe 2018)
In qualitative interviews, the researcher can change the order of the interview questions and
even modify the questions themselves, ask new follow-up questions, and let the interviewee
talk in a way that she pleases. The focus lies in the thoughts of the interviewee and hence the
interview guide is only a guide, not a report that has to be followed strictly. Qualitative
interviews strive for long and wide answers in contrast to quantitative interviews, where the
answers must be documented and easily conserved. (Bryman & Bell 2015)
An interview guide is composed in order to make the interview reliable and for the interviews
to have the same structure. The questions need to be asked in a logical order, and without a
plan, the interview might easily lose track. (Lantz 2007) Apart from the researcher leading
the interview forward, it is also important that the interviewee has given their consent to the
interview and that what is said during the interview can be used as data for analysing the
results afterwards (Denscombe 2018).

47

Tove Lindholm
The qualitative interview can be divided into two categories, the unstructured and the semistructured interview. The unstructured interview does not follow any predetermined
questions and hence the interview resembles a normal conversation. The interviewer might
start with one question but other than that, lets the interviewee talk freely and ask questions
only when needed or to keep the interview going. The semi-structured interview, on the other
hand, follows an interview guide made beforehand by the interviewer. The questions stated
in the guide are all asked in the same way, but they do not necessarily need to be asked in a
specific order and additional questions can be asked. The semi-structured interview leaves
room for the interview to heave depending on the situation, just like the unstructured
interview. (Bryman & Bell 2015) Both forms of qualitative interviews, however, are
searching for an answer to something specific and in that sense an interview is not equal to a
discussion. (Lantz 2007)
Personal interviews are the most common form of qualitative interviews, before group
interviews and focus groups. The advantages of personal interviews are that they only require
two persons to match their calendars to find a possible slot for the interview. Moreover, they
allow for a clear understanding of who said what and it is simple to transcribe the recordings
as only one person acts as the source. (Denscombe 2018)
Regarding research ethics, the researcher must not cause any harm to the interviewees during
data collection. This is also applicable when analysing the data when emphasis must be
placed on objectivity and honesty. The researcher must value the interviewees' right to
anonymity, which additionally is a favourable method for preventing negative outcomes for
the interview objects. (Denscombe 2018)

5.5 Interview objects
Since the market for edible insects in Finland can be considered small, it put some restrictions
on choosing the interview objects most suitable for the purpose of the study. The interview
objects were chosen based on their activity in the field for edible insects in Finland. The
companies involved in the study were restricted to companies whose end products were
directed at human consumers or farmers. At the time of interviewing, the companies ranged
48

Tove Lindholm
from one-year-old to six-year-old companies. The companies sell their products both directly
to the customer through their webstore, offers or at events, but also through other distribution
channels such as grocery stores and speciality stores.
Below is a list of the persons in alphabetical order who were interviewed together with their
title, company and date of interview. ChefBug, Entis, Griidy and Muurahaiskauppa are all
companies focusing on business-to-consumers while EntoCube focuses on business-tobusiness. Muurahaiskauppa is inactive and hence Robert Ramstedt is in this study handled
as both company representative and a field expert. The other field experts have various
backgrounds; Susanne Heiska is Senior Scientist at Natural Resources Institute Finland, Topi
Kairenius and Ilkka Taponen are two of the founding members of Tuotantohyönteiset ry
which is an association for domestic food and feed insect industry actors. Ilkka Taponen is
not active in the association anymore and is hence not representing the association but acting
as a field expert with both domestic and international experience. Topi Kairenius is an insect
chef, author and speaker and has been active in the field for edible insects and promoting
insects long before it became legal to sell insects for humans, and has arranged events and
caterings for many years through his site Hyönteiskokki.

Even though all interview objects gave their consent to release their names in this thesis I
have, however, chosen to keep them anonymous in the analysis as the sample is small. I will
refer to them as C1, C2, C3, C4 and E1, E2, E3 and E4 in which the C stands for Company
representative and the E stands for Expert in the field.

5.6 Data analysis
According to Bryman and Burgess (1994), qualitative research analysis is a continuous
procedure and the researcher can choose to either start analysing the data immediately after
collecting parts of the data, or wait for all data to be collected before beginning the process.
Gibson and Brown (2009) continue that qualitative research often does not follow a straight
line from topic decision to ready paper through theory collecting and data gathering and
analysis. But rather, jumps from phase to phase and the researcher might want to consult
theory in the middle of data analysis or stop writing a collect more data. Hence, the process,
even though following a structured plan from beginning to the final version, can form
according to the need and occasion.
Analysing qualitative interviews is made based on the interviews themselves, linked together
to the bigger picture. The data collected through qualitative interviews is, as stated
previously, descriptive and according to the flow of the interview. One cannot make a
comprehensive analysis by summarising the answers, but the answers must be put into
perspective. (Lantz 2007) A condition favourable for success in analysing qualitative
interviews is that the interviews are recorded and transcribed. Transcribing takes time and
hence needs to be planned as a part of the research. Moreover, transcribing the interview
assists in both reminding about the interview, what was said and how, and offers an easier
method to analysing the data than listening to the recording repeatedly. (Denscombe 2018)
A total of eight interviews were conducted for this thesis. All of the interviews were done in
Finnish and two were done virtually due to partly long distance between interviewer and
interviewee and partly because of the recommendations by the authorities regarding the
corona virus COVID-19. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and the results translated
into English. The transcribed material amounted to 73 pages in the language in which the
50

Tove Lindholm
interviews were conducted in, Finnish. All quotations are hence translations made by the
researcher. Most of the interviews were done face to face with the interviewee at a place that
suited them the best, except for two interviews that were conducted via Skype. The interview
objects were not offered anything in return and wanted to take part in the study. The
researcher did not know the interviewees since before.
A common way of analysing qualitative data is by recognising themes that occur in the data,
called thematic analysis. Thematic analysis focuses on recognising three aspects in the data,
being commonly arising themes, opposing views and how the various components relate to
each other. (Gibson & Brown 2009) In this study, I transcribed the data into the same
structure as was used for the interview guide, highlighting topics and subtopics. This way
analysing the data and finding patterns was eased, as the interviews were unique in form due
to the respondent’s way of answering the questions.

5.7 Summary
This chapter started with briefly exploring the research method where after the
trustworthiness of a study, particularly a qualitative study, was inspected. The chapter
continued by presenting the chosen research method, why I chose to go forward with a
qualitative approach and analysing the appointed interview method more closely. Finally, the
data source was presented together with a detailed description of how the data was collected.
The interview objects were presented, as well as the procedure for how the data was collected
and analysed.

Empirical findings

This chapter will present the results of the study. Altogether eight interviews were conducted
for this thesis and the results will be presented according to the main topics in the Interview
Guide (found under Appendices). The same guide was used for all interviews and the main
topics are Background, Strategy, Customers and Competition. Although, as reliability is not
measured in the same way in qualitative research in which the interviewer has an important
role as the research conductor herself, as in quantitative research in which the same
questionnaire is used for many respondents (Daymon & Holloway 2010: 78-79), the flow
might have been slightly different regarding interviewee and progress of the interview. The
answers have however critically been analysed case-by-case and carefully implemented
under the right category.

6.1 Background
As an introduction to the theme, I asked the interviewees to tell me how they started either
the insect business or first became interested in the field and what it was that triggered the
spark. Many expressed their interest in sustainable development and sustainable food
production as reasons to explore the potential of edible insects. This was accompanied by
saving the world and finding solutions to battle famine and the unsustainable meat production
we are used to today. Another reason is overall health and finding varieties when dealing
with allergies. Finland was mentioned as a pioneer country in this field, compared to the
Nordic countries. Three of the respondents mentioned taking the leap to the field by wanting
to explore innovative and novelty things overall and to bring new products to the market. In
a few cases the spark for either interest in edible insects or found a company was triggered
through studies. Many of the respondents had food or gastronomy as a hobby and were at the
same time concerned by the world situation and the climate.
“It originally started as a hobby. As early as ten years ago, I started experimenting with
picking wild insects and raising them myself”. (E1)

52

Tove Lindholm
The Madventures show with Riku Rantala and Tunna Milonoff was brought up by a few of
the interviewees, which indicates that the show has made an impact on both the active
partners in the field but most likely also the customers, as one of the interviewees told me.
One interviewee brought up intuition and the feeling after having watched a video of a
Finnish pioneer cooking with insects, and that was a triggering factor.
As to sum up, in six out of eight cases sustainability was a main reason for entering the field
of edible insects, either as a founder of a company or as a field expert. In two cases the main
reasons were excitement over novelty products and an urge to deliver something new to the
market. The FAO report from 2013 Edible Insects: Future Prospects for Food and Feed
Security regarding usage of edible insects was mentioned as a trigger and important document
in the beginning of choosing the path for future career.
“Like many others, I had experience of eating insects through travelling in Asia, and the
FAO report threw gasoline into the flames; a big organisation stated that insects are a smart
thing. Further through the improvement of the world and ecology foremost, and also the fact
that on the hobby side food has long been close to the heart.” C4

6.2 Strategy
On the question on how they would describe their strategy, C1 said that their strategy is an
ongoing process and the focus is to create tasty and successful products for a reasonable
price. Their strategy is evolving constantly, and they must challenge their own ideas
continually. C2 emphasised the urge to normalise the products to consumers and focus on
making tasty products. The strategy was also to start small and slowly grow. C3 has the same
approach and focus on normalizing insects in the Western countries as an ingredient as they
have good nutritional values and are organic. They underlined, that trends in many cases start
in the West to then move on to other countries; by consuming insects here (in the West) it
might be possible to reach other countries where a good source of protein is needed. They
are focusing on making products that are easy to approach. C4 said that their strategy is to
acquire new customers and build networks in Europe. E3 answered that their main strategy
had been internationalisation as the Finnish market was too small. C3 also brought up that
53

Tove Lindholm
they try to focus on one main target area and do it well; the optimal situation would be to
control everything in the production chain, from farming to processing and consumers and
business, but as resources are small one has to choose a clear focus.
When I asked what their strategy is, one of the respondents thought aloud about it and ended
up saying:
“The strategy is to try and do different things all the time and advance through success. A
blind monkey in a dark room-type of strategy, where you try to find the liana by fumbling.”
(C1)
The above answer sums it up rather well. As the field is new both to the companies and the
consumers there are not yet ways that are better than others and the actors move forward by
trial and error. The companies are learning by doing and exploring new opportunities.
Strategy development
Coping with the fact that the market is new, the companies are still experimenting with what
works best for them. For some, the path has been straighter than for others, but they are still
testing and trying to determine what product is most successful. All companies mentioned
that pricing is still an issue and that the end product, in many cases, simply is too expensive.
They have been exploring different options and solutions, and some have ventured products
from consumers to animals, from processing to growing insects, whether to focus on whole
insects or insect flour, whether to be active in growing the farming network and so on. All
this have however helped the companies gain experience in the field, but they are still
finetuning their core business idea. They are all focusing on narrowing down the core idea.
One of the interviewees mentioned that they are changing their strategy more towards directto-consumer and focusing on their webstore.
Challenges
The biggest challenge for the companies is prejudice. Previously the fact that selling edible
insects was not legal was the biggest obstacle and especially two of the companies were
active in bending the rules. Moreover, price is a major challenge. E1 wished for the sake of
54

Tove Lindholm
the whole field that pricing would be more competitive. C3 said that farming insects is still
costly for three reasons; it is not yet automatised enough, it is low scale business and it is not
subsidised. Hence, it can hardly be compared to meat production. They believe that when the
price is at the same level as meat today, it will change consumer behaviour.
The business-to-consumer company representatives all mentioned quality and Finnish
produce as top factors when creating products. As C2 said, they are not striving to being the
biggest or most successful as the other criteria, being sustainability, health, and price, are
more important. E3 said that companies in Finland see marketing as an expense instead of an
investment which is challenging. Small start-ups might not have the resources, but marketing
is essential for surviving. E4 continued that many new companies seemed to have been
created based on emotion rather than experience as insects have been interesting. However,
these companies have not succeeded which shows that companies with relevant experience
in their teams are more successful.
“Prejudice is the greatest challenge. A big challenge is also the price. Awareness needs to
be raised still.” (C2)
One of the field experts, E2, mentioned, that in the beginning all companies had to do
everything, e.g. developing their business processes, marketing, develop production and
animal feed and apply for permissions, among others. This was difficult for the companies,
while at the same time trying to protect their interests. Now that the field has developed, the
companies have started to find the direction they want to proceed in and collaboration
between companies is better, which shapes the field further. E1 mentioned that the main
priority is to tell as many people as possible why insects are good. C3 however said that it is
costly to tell people why they should eat insects. E1 continued that when the interest in
Finland now is low, companies should turn their focus on international markets, and when
the interest in Finland rises one of the ultimate philosophies regarding edible insects, locality,
can be reached.

55

Tove Lindholm
Both E3 and E4 said that now might not yet be the right time for insects, and that the right
time is still to come. In that case, the companies already active are early out and this is one
challenge.
Marketing, mission, and vision
The main marketing operations done by all companies are tastings and taking part in events.
Since the core obstacle has been to encourage potential customers to try and taste insects,
that has been the number one priority. As E4 said, Finnish consumers do not have any
memories of their mothers cooking delicious crickets but when a generation like this grows
up the situation will be another. Tastings have been done at different events such as festivals
and shopping malls, but also smaller occasions such as private events have been arranged.
Media coverage was intense two years ago when Finland allowed marketing and selling
insects to consumers and the media wanted recipes for insects. The problem back then was
that no-one, in fact, could make the dishes as insects could not easily be bought.
C3 said that they communicate their vision and mission better now than before, and that they
strive to tell their existing customers about their vision, both offline and online. As an
example, both C2 and C3 add small notes with information or greetings to the customer
ordering products from their webstore. C3 emphasised repeating the core message in all
communication. E2 pointed out, that the packaging for edible insects abroad is more
informative and promotes the ecological aspects of insects. E2 continued that it seems that
companies now develop products for more thought-through forerunner customer groups.
“Now, perhaps a little more thought will be given to the fact that there are potential consumer
groups who are pioneers in insect eating and mainstreaming. And let’s think about the
products targeted for the slightly narrower target group that they fit their needs. The
marketing actions of the insect products may not be visible to such a wide audience.” (E2)
E3 had found social media marketing and Google marketing to be the most beneficial forms
of marketing for companies with small resources. Facebook and Instagram require less time
but if the company has time, then search engine optimisation is the best tool to utilise. This
56

Tove Lindholm
was supported by C3, who uses social media and influencers in their marketing, but also mass
media. The importance of media was pointed out by all interviewees, however, with the
constraint that Finnish media is not publishing articles about edible insects now as the field
is experiencing a dip. A few of the respondents pointed out however, that it is only the media
who describes the field dipping, but in reality, it is developing. E3 continued that new
applications such as TikTok probably would work for targeting a younger customer group
who are not nervous about insects. E3 pointed out that Google is good for targeting customers
who already are close to buying while social media works as informative channels.
“If you have the time and know how to write then SEO is the best. It requires you to be able
to write and you have time. And if you have less time then you should invest in either
Instagram or Facebook. Or if you know what people are buying then Google is the best as
when googling people are more likely to buy, they are looking for thing X because they need
it.” (E3)
Another event where the different actors have been collaborating to raise awareness is “Bugi
Hyönteisruokafestivaali”, an event that has been arranged two years in a row. In 2018 the
event was held in Helsinki and in 2019 in Pori. The clientele was slightly different as the
event in Helsinki was held in Maria 01, a non-profit entrepreneurial community, and in Pori
in a shopping mall. According to the actors present at the events, the shopping mall worked
well as the event attracted passers-buyers that would not otherwise have interacted. The
reason for arranging the event in Pori was because of the “Bugs and Brands” development
project in the Satakunta area, lasting from 1.3.2019 to 31.8.2020 (Bugs and Brands, 2020).
One of the companies also created a truck that drove around in Finland, serving insects to
people. It helped in reaching new potential customers who would otherwise not have tasted
insects. Creating trust amongst customers was mentioned as an important part in normalizing
and using chefs’ clothes at events had proven successful. It creates confidence for the
product.
As the Muji store opened its doors in a big shopping mall in the centre of Helsinki in
December 2019, it has for two of the company’s proven to be a big visibility factor. They
57

Tove Lindholm
managed to provide their products to a more competitive price and together with the
marketing done by the store, sales have been good. Compared to the conventional grocery
stores where products compete for visibility with thousands of other products, at Muji
visibility is better.
The company representatives all emphasised the importance of good visibility online and
having a working web store, especially for reaching out to customers abroad.
Marketing actions shaping the market
For one of the companies, the next steps in shaping the market are to stabilise production and
find the right distribution channels, and to think about what products to focus on, where they
should be sold and to whom, and put the focus on purposefully developing these elements.
E3 wish that the market would develop in a diverse manner and that the price range would
settle near the level of meat products. For another of the companies, the next steps include
focusing on protein products, meat replacements and snacks, with the aim on creating
products that can compete with other existing products both regarding price, taste and
environmental aspects. The other companies will concentrate on the web store and growing
their network. Most of the interviewees pictured a future where meat consumption has
decreased and in which insects are a part of the everyday diet.
“It’s ultimately a pretty simple thing to embrace why insects are such a sensible option in
food production. When you just get to explain and a person realizes it and gets inspired by it
herself and puts it on the end of the salad table where there’s some nuts and roasted onions
and you add crickets because it fits perfectly.” (E1)
Now is a calmer period and the market has subsided. C1 saw the positive in the situation as
they now have time to work on innovations and improve products, without pressure from the
media. On the other hand, the viewpoint of C2 who represented a smaller company wished
for the interest to take off again soon. All interviewees, however, eagerly waited for the
market to grow slowly but steadily. They commented that the market development so far has
jumped forward with peaks and lows and it has been under much work to respond to the
demand. However, E4 pointed out the, apart from what the media might communicate, edible
58

Tove Lindholm
insect sales have never reached a high peak to be followed by a crash, sales have instead
increased slowly and never been exceptional. E4 continued that as human food insects might
never become as popular as vegetable protein but as animal feed the situation is another. This
was supported by E1 who however wished for insects to be normalised as human food too.
However, diversity and different alternatives is key, and every possibility that aids in
decreasing meat consumption is good.
“Certainly, it would be nice to hope for explosive growth, but for myself, I would hope for
upward, steady growth. Since these are insects that not only appear somewhere, they need
to be bred and taken care of and the conditions put in order. Furthermore, they are living
beings

with

whom

we

are

dealing.”

(C1)

When asking the interviewees how they see that their marketing actions have shaped the
market, C1 answered that the insect truck left the biggest impact and they got lots of positive
feedback. As for now, the most important marketing activity to be done is mainstreaming
edible insects and that is done by offering good experiences to people. Two of the companies
created unconventional products containing insects before it was legal to sell insects for
human food. One of them was a jar with crickets and granola and marketed and sold as
kitchen decoration (keittiösomiste); a somewhat provocative product that was not openly
meant for food. Another product from the same producer was crickets in a bag (sirkkapussi),
sold as eye candy. The cricket bag did not pass the screening of the authorities and was forced
to be taken away from the retail store but instead sparked the authorities to react.
“I would argue that one of the absolute biggest things was getting a product on store shelves
and thereby sparking the conversation. Another thing that was done in the beginning was
talking with politicians too, no direct or targeted lobbying was done but whenever there was
a chance it was used as well. And then the footwork that was done has been a really big
deal.” (C4)
Moreover, tastings and interacting with people in different ways was seen as important by all
companies as well as experts. However, both companies and experts agreed that
59

Tove Lindholm
communicating vision and mission could be improved. E4 mentioned, that they analysed
social media marketing made by various companies in the field, and the result showed that it
was not active, and, with a few exceptions, there seemed to be no strategy behind. E4 thought
that one reason might be that long-term marketing actions fall short of short-term actions as
resources are limited. E3 continued, that companies should invest more in acquiring longterm customers, as the lifetime value matter more, and continued that marketing actions
cannot be assumed to bring back revenue immediately after one campaign but requires a
lasting action plan.
What is special in the field for edible insects compared to almost any other field, is that here
things are done that have never been done before. – E4
C1 says that there have been discussions on doing more marketing together as all companies
are small and none have massive resources. Hence everyone is needed, and the longer they
stay, the better. This was mentioned by all interviewees, that every company operates from
a slightly different angle which adds to the palette. C1 continued that they focus on products
that they think are reasonable and let other companies concentrate on other products. As the
market stabilises there has been some ideation on joining forces in order to break through the
European market, but the discussions are not that far yet.
Main drivers for the market to be created and shaped
E2 mentioned one main driver for companies to rethink their strategies was the market
struggles that occurred in the beginning and forced companies to develop. On the question
of how the market has changed since they started, C1 answered that many have already tried
and tasted insects but not everyone. C1 continued that the market is now more accepting and
hence has turned in a better, more favourable direction. Media was mentioned as one
important actor in shaping the market as it managed to create a hype. All the interviewees
however saw the media hype slightly negative as the market was not ready to deliver yet.
However, the cricket bread by Fazer was mentioned as an important product to create trust
for the field, even though all agreed that the product itself was not great.

60

Tove Lindholm
C3 said that in Finland the market has changed so that the novelty in it has faded. Many have
already eaten insects and are now waiting for the products to develop. Now it is not enough
that the products contain insects to bring added value, but they need to also be reasonably
priced, tasty and the insect should bring something relevant to the product.
E2 continued that one way of mainstreaming edible insects would be to add them to the
official dining recommendation and further implemented in the public sector. For this to
happen more research is needed regarding e.g. nutritional values and processes. However, as
this is a lengthy process E2 saw that the market first will develop with the help of early
adaptor customers and through the European market. E3 said that there will always be people
to whom the charm of novelty is enough, but one cannot build a business with it as a
foundation. E3 continued that buying overpriced products simply because they are ecological
does not make it in the long run.
“There is always a group for whom the charm of novelty is enough. As long as there is
something it’s enough. But you can't build a business on it.” (E3)
Customer acceptance and reactions
On the question of how Finnish people have reacted towards the new market, C1 and C3
answered that it divides people. Overall, all respondents answered that Finnish customer have
responded well, and in most cases, better than in other countries. The most surprising thing
for C1 was to notice that there are many people in Finland who have already been growing,
for example, mealworms at home. The time is now favourable for edible insects as
sustainable development in general and climate change in particular is an important issue
which everyone ought to think and do something about. Even though climate change is a
serious business, they do not want to make eating serious, and hence strive to keep eating
insects fun. C2 mentioned that children are well-informed about sustainability issues and that
many customers point out that insects are the future. C3 and E3 continues that Finnish people
seem to be open toward new things and one reason behind this is that Finland has neither a
strong food culture like other countries nor a strong identity when it comes to traditional
dishes. E2 said that according to earlier research, it was expected that Finns would try insects
open-mindedly. What was surprising however, was that people tried but only once. It is easy
61

Tove Lindholm
to sell an exciting product once but even more so difficult to create a continuous demand. E2
continued that Finns are however open to new foodstuffs but it requires more marketing,
better products, and time.
As the company is young, C1 said that it is easy to challenge oneself as it happens
automatically when trying to determine what works and what does not. It is good to have a
team of people from diverse backgrounds. This was supported by E3. C3 mentioned that
some products are meant only to create a market but does not necessarily solve any problems
that insect food otherwise can, referring to sustainability issues.
“The charm of novelty is gone and now the products need to develop and offer some added
value. It is no longer enough to have a cricket in the product, but it should be reasonably
priced, tasty, and cricket should really bring something sensible to that product.” (C3)

6.3 Customers
All company representatives said that they are still working on defining the different
customer segments and collecting data to support segmenting. The field experts did not either
have a clear answer on who the customers are, and one said that field does not yet have clear
data on who the customers are, compared to animal feed. All however had guesses based on
events and webstore analytics.
Defining customers have according to C1 been difficult but one cannot exclude
demographical factors. The biggest customer segment that is more visible as a group is men
under 40-50 years old. On the other hand, C1 continued, that in many families it is the woman
who decides what to buy and her preferences might be different from the males’. According
to C2’s observation, males between 25 and 35 years are the biggest customer segment as well
as children. E1 had not yet found what the linking factor is in people who are interested in
edible insects as the group is so diverse. C3 defined the main customer to be a person living
in the city who probably has a higher education and reflects on what to consume, age and sex
does not matter. This was supported by E3 who define the main customers to be males under
40 years or females over 65 years who live in the capital city area and have a certain income
62

Tove Lindholm
level to make buying overpriced products possible. However, C3 continued that it depends
more on the product what appeals to whom.
At this moment, C1 emphasised that they need to address their product to a big crowd as the
customer segments are still to be found. This was supported by E1 who however points out
that companies with a clear target group have a good starting point. C3 claimed the leading
challenge to be reducing the customer acquisition cost. They target customers by offering
their products in areas where their target customers live and utilise influencers on social
media.
E2 said that the main consumer is a working parent with several children who quickly must
pick up something from the grocery store and rapidly make dinner. A major surprise for C2
and E3 was noticing that the elderly has shown great interest in the products as they are
concerned about getting enough protein. The elderly is however difficult to reach as they
need to be met in person. They are not the ones who buy products online. E2 continued that
for this product, edible insects, the companies should focus on the early adaptor customers
who are conscious about sustainability issues.
C2 wished that insects would be introduced in schools more, for example in cooking classes.
Customers also consist of sports events and educational establishments. C3 said that they
strive to targeting a younger customer segment as they will be the future potential when the
market grows bigger and continues that is a balance between the present and the future.
Added value
C1 said, that the added value they want to give their customers is to bring interesting,
sustainable, transparent, healthy, and tasty food to people. E4 thinks that the added value in
edible insects lies in the visuals of whole insects, however, continues that insect flour is the
easiest way to reach out to the mass. This was supported by E2. C3 said that the added value
they offer their customer lies in the wide product range with products being easily
approachable and points out that their products with edible insects are dairy free, soy free,
gluten free and contains nutritional fibre, vitamin B12 and iron. The nutritional aspect was
63

Tove Lindholm
brought up by all companies. C3 continued that being able to offer customers good nutritional
value in combination with a sustainable farming method brings added value. E2 saw added
value in ethical values and ecological contribution and thinks that a product group that would
not promote insects as such but concentrate on the sustainability aspects such as ethically and
sustainably produced products. E2 thought that an ethical product group would make it easy
for consumers to know that they are making a good choice by choosing a product, which
would make them feel good without emphasising the insects too much. E2 pointed out that
certificates are important when marketing abroad.
When developing a new product, C1 said the ideation starts from two factors: it has to taste
good and it must bring some sort of added value to the customer. For some, the value might
lie in getting nutrients such as vitamin B12 or protein, for others it might be about actually
seeing the insect or just wanting to try insects and add it in their diet.
“It cannot be a product that contains insects just for the sake of insects, but that people have
some reason to buy it.” (C1)
Customer participating in marketing
All respondents mentioned that their customers actively market their products. Edible insects
are such a product that eating it is an experience that most do together with a friend and post
it on social media. However, E1 pointed out that for a product to be visually interesting it
needs to contain whole insects instead of insect flour. This has been a key factor in reaching
potential customers and helped to spread the word as a network. Consequently, thought has
been put into branding, design of packaging and development. C1 enthusiastically said that
edible insects provoke discussion and interest, which might be a reason why it was noticed
quickly. A customer finds the product and influences where the product will end up
physically by bringing it with her. One of the companies was creating a new customer
program to engage with both old and new customers. E3 said that they should have included
customers more in marketing and referred to referral concepts where the customer
recommends a product to a friend and benefits from it by receiving a discount code. This
thought was also mentioned by E4.

6.4 Competition
When asking about competition, the answers differ. One of the companies saw some of the
other Finnish actors in the same field as competition, while they cooperate with others. The
same company prefers working and developing on its own. Another company mentioned the
rest of the world that competes with the same sort of products in general, and Eastern Europe
in particular, as their main competitor as the workforce is cheaper there. C3 argued, that it
depends on the customer and from what angle they approach the products. Competition can
be composed from the meat industry but also companies providing vegetable protein
products.
“I would think about competition from a broader perspective. The biggest competitor is
people's consumption habits. They are not used to eating crickets.” (C3)
Competition also rises from different fields when customers are making choices on what to
buy or invest in, which means companies must keep an open mind to where possible
competition stems from. E2 answered that the situation has been intense, and the field is
constantly changing, and that many companies probably sense that an extra pair of eyes in
the back of one’s head would be beneficial to know what is happening. It is difficult to
perceive what will drive change as change is constant and companies need to adapt and be
proactive. C4 said that the increased competition did not affect their strategy, but it has helped
in the decision on what parts of their business to discard and what to focus on. Increased
competition was by all interviewees perceived as positive and when more actors are active
in the field it brings trust in the field as a whole. E4, accompanied by C3, said that when one
company is growing, it grows by earning shares from other fields, not by cannibalising the
other companies in the same field. Since companies increase in both number and size and the
unsuccessful ones quit, it gradually becomes clearer for the existing companies what to focus
on. Hence, the field is now starting to experience companies differentiating themselves from
one another. E3 said that a company that has taken care of its economy and has a strong brand
is competition to take seriously. The companies were however concerned about the increased
competition in a way that if any actors in the field performs poorly or causes harm it will
65

Tove Lindholm
affect the whole field. Moreover, the challenge with disagreeing on how to shape the market
was brought up. E1 answered that before it became legal to sell edible insects all actors were,
in a way, together against the authorities. Now that the market is open the foundation for
competitive setting is there, but it does not show. E1 continued that every company takes
care of their own business and strive to differentiate from the others. One of the respondents
argued that not every actor strives to normalise the products but rather rides on the product
being somewhat extreme and creating a wow effect.
E4 pointed out that the companies collaborate more than compete, and if any of the
companies active in the field is doing poorly or failing it is a loss to all the other companies
at the same time. This was supported by E3 who said that actors in this field have collaborated
remarkably well and supported each other.
“Finnish companies cooperate a lot and do not compete with each other that much. The fact
is that if one of the firms does poorly or fails then it is also a loss to the other firms. The fact
that there are more actors brings credibility to others.” (E4)
Partners
On the question of who the main partners are, all companies mention the big grocery stores
as well as smaller specialty stores in Finland. All companies acknowledged peer companies
in the same field as partners. Moreover, international chains was mentioned as exciting
potential; the cricket bags are small, and people transport them on trips when they go abroad.
Other partners are marketing agencies, insect farmers and roasters. Apart from the web store,
also restaurants are important distribution channels.
“Every single person who has the possibility to make these products visible and bring them
forward, I count as our partner.” (C1)
C4 mentioned their customers as the main partners. They have an open dialogue with the
customers and the customers contact them when they want to bring up ideas and thoughts.

66

Tove Lindholm
Hence the customers influence the product development even though the company does not
systematically ideate on future strategies for shaping the market with their customers.
Rules in the field
When asking the interviewees if any regulations or rules have been drawn up within the field
by the actors, most companies mentioned “Tuotantohyönteiset ry” which is an association
that brings all actors together and acts as an information channel to and from the authorities.
E4 mentioned, that when selling edible insects became legal in Finland, close to every actor
in the field came together to discuss rules and regulation with the Finnish Food Authority.
This has led to the point where Finland has one of the best guides for insect farming and is
consulted by other countries. A few of the interviewees, both company representatives and
field experts, said that the communication with the authorities has been open and there has
been no friction in the dialogue. However, before the regulation was changed the actors active
already then had to learn how to handle the authorities which in the beginning seemed
difficult.
E2 brought up IPIFF (International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed) as an active
organisation in Europe promoting edible insects, where actors in the field together have
formulated the guidelines.
What is the secret to success?
As the last question for the interviewees, I asked why they think that they are still in business
and have not gone bankrupt or quit. To the interviewees who did not represent a company, I
asked the same question in general. The answers were similar, and an aspect that rose were
that companies that commenced during the hype phase without any background in either
start-ups or the food industry have quit, partly due to overly optimistic expectations for
growth. C3 found that companies who try to do everything struggle to a bigger extent as the
resources will not suffice. Many newcomers started when media wrote about the prospects
in the field without further experience or solid business plan. E3 emphasized the importance
of a good team beside having a good product. C3 answered that they had a long-term vision
since the start with no expectation of immediate change or that customers would rush for
their products. C1 said that they have proceeded with patience and with a modifiable strategy.
67

Tove Lindholm
C1 continued that they want to try what works before investing heavily, divide risk and
develop products and sales through trial and error. C2 answered that quality is their main
priority, and starting small with a stable base.
“Partly because of luck and partly because of perseverance, and ability to make quick
changes of direction. It has not been easy for us either.” ( C4)
E2 pointed out that the ability to predict and to adapt to change has been strong in the
surviving companies. Moreover, diverse knowledge within the team is important. E2
continued that being part in innovative business always comes with risks and hence good risk
management is crucial. That, and luck. Companies who have been able to move forward
despite failing attempts, understand competition and the customer as well as the big picture
and networked internationally, they have succeeded.

6.5 Summary
In conclusion, it can be noted that as the companies still are small and young, none of them
had a clearly defined strategy. However, all companies had engaged in marketing activities
to both make and shape the market they are active in. This was noticed by all interviewees,
both company representatives and field experts. Main marketing activities was taking part in
events, organise tastings, market on social media and through the webpage, and through
repetition slowly but steadily work to change people’s feelings of edible insects as part of a
normal diet. The strategy was seen as an ongoing process where main factors are to create
tasty products to a good price, and that are easily accessible.
Defining the main target customer group was proven to be challenging for the same reason
that the companies did not have a clear strategy. The results showed that the main customer
is a male between 25-50 years of age, who most probably lives in the city and has a decent
income level. Moreover, children were seen as an upcoming potential segment when they
grow up, and surprisingly the elderly had shown interest.
The different actors in the field for edible insects collaborate well, although the collaboration
was more distinct before the regulation was changed and it became legal to sell insects for
food in Finland. This was thought to be because before all actors promoting edible insects
68

Tove Lindholm
had to work together against the authorities which was a unifying factor. However, many of
the respondents said that the collaboration with the Finnish Food Authority has been
frictionless and open. Apart from the companies, several actors are active in the field, and
the respondents mentioned partners such as retail, marketing agencies, customers, and each
other. Factors why the companies, who have succeeded in this field, are still operating, were
mentioned to be starting small and steadily grow, have clear business plan and not invest
heavily to soon.

Data analysis

In the previous chapter the empirical findings from the data collection was presented in
detail. In this chapter the results will be analysed further based on the theoretical framework,
in order to find similarities and patterns. The analysis will follow the same structure as the
empirical findings, using the main topics from the interview guide as headlines. However,
the different backgrounds will be integrated with the strategies used. Further a deeper
analysis of the customers is made, followed by an evaluation of the competition. Finally, the
chapter is wrapped up with a summary.

7.1 Strategy
Many of the interviewees said that one of the reasons for delving into the field of edible
insects, was a concern for the environment. Sustainable development of the world we live in
was raised as an issue. In many cases it was however not the only reason but rather combined
with other interests such as wanting to create or be part of something new, drive to build a
start-up, or learn something new.
The field for edible insects in Finland is still small as are the companies. This showed in the
interviews in the companies not having clear strategies yet, or not being able to communicate
them clearly. However, the active companies have during the past years grown their
understanding for the market and are actively working on improving their situation.
Varadarajan (2009) states that a marketing strategy includes components related to
marketing. The interviewees all mentioned various marketing related actions such as taking
part in events, tastings, and improving the webstore. Dibb et al. (2016), argues that the
marketing strategy should be based on where the company positions itself and where it is
heading, supporting the main corporate strategy and be the interpreter for the company about
what the market looks like. Even though neither of the companies had a clear strategy they
were all able to list marketing related actions that they had already done or were going to
develop. One of the companies was more active especially in social media than the others
and it was clear that they invested more in marketing. Kindström et al. (2018) says that even
70

Tove Lindholm
small actions shape the market which supports all steps taken by the actors working with
edible insects in Finland.
Theory implies that yet no marketing strategy for edible insects has proven better than
another (Collins at al. 2019). This is supported by the empirical results, where the respondents
state that they are testing different approaches.
Social media is used as a marketing channel both by the companies via their own channels,
but also by individual customers who test the products and share their experiences through
their own profiles. This can be tied together with the presented theory about creating value
together. Value is no longer created solely at the time of purchase, but value keeps being
created afterwards when the customer uses the product. The individual benefits when she can
announce what she has experienced to her network. The company benefits when information
about their products is being distributed and reaches potential new customers. The market
benefits when knowledge about the supply and market as a whole grows. To create added
value can hence in the best-case scenario benefit all actors in the same field where everyone
profits from the situation. Ben Letaifa (2014) argues that value is co-created by the company
and its customers, which supports the above results of value co-creation. Moreover, Vargo
& Lusch (2012) says, that value has previously been thought of as something that company
produces and is transferred to the customer at the stage of buying the product or service. Even
though this still is correct, the product or service should be able to create value also after the
event of purchase, which can be assumed by the results. However, a common challenge for
the companies is that the products are still on the expensive side and that customers taste the
products once but do not necessary return to buy more. The added value might not be enough
for the customer to return. This could however be a question for marketing communication
in its task to reach out to customers.
However, by inspecting marketing actions and frequency of them in various digital channels
it is clear which of the companies has more resources at hand and investing in marketing.
Time will show how it affects business growth.
However oblivious of the other respondents’ answers, all companies agreed that the core task
at this point is to offer customers tasty products, take care of hygiene and avoid scandals such
71

Tove Lindholm
as food poisoning. Parment (2008) says that products answer several demands apart from the
essential requirement. In the case with edible insects, companies answered that they want to
make products that taste good, but also emphasised other criteria such as the products being
suitable for people with allergies, insects being a positive replacement for meat as a more
sustainable option and the edible insects promoting health.
Even if all companies and field experts expressed their thoughts on heading for international
markets to be the most sensible strategy, one of the companies explicitly expressed their
vision to first conquer the Western countries and then focusing on countries where food is
scarcer. This is supported by Bradley (2005) who argues that in many cases products are first
made common in developed countries where after they enter the markets of developed
countries Bradley continues that when launching products in new markets the product most
likely needs to be adjusted as the same approach might not work the same way as in another
market. This can be adapted to the new edible insect market in Finland. Even though the
situation is slightly different, with new start-up companies introducing the product directly
in Finland instead of a multinational company, similarities are still to be seen. In Finland,
adjustments have been made to how the product have been marketed and offered. In
comparison to markets where insects have been consumed before and the insects sold as they
are and simply roasted, the Finnish market has not been ready for such an approach. Here
efforts have been made to blend in the insects into other, more approachable products. First,
before the legislation changed, crickets where sold as kitchen decoration and eye candy in a
jar with muesli ingredients. After the legislation renewal, crickets where introduced in, for
Finns so much loved and consumed, bread.
The orientation towards the field for edible insects in Finland where the actors are still small,
is supporting the literature that shows that even small actors can shape a market, even
individuals (see Baker and Nenonen 2020). Because the resources are scarcer, it might take
more time, but all marketing action contribute to shaping the market. The creation and
shaping of this market have however been supported by bigger actors such as big companies
and institutions. As an example, one can mention Fazer launching the cricket bread as soon
as it was legal, as well as changes in regulation. This is supported by the theory, where Raspin

72

Tove Lindholm
and Smith (2008) suggests that as markets are made as an outcome of several factors, the
market itself must be seen as multifaceted.
Hence, even though the companies are not consciously working for shaping the market as
such, their actions drive the market towards change. As the field for edible insects is new,
several factors such as consumer habits and processes evolve slowly. Nenonen and Storbacka
(2018) emphasise that companies who want to shape the market they are in, need to view the
market as changeable, not something stable that needs to be adjusted to. This is the case with
edible insects in Finland as the market that has evolved does not yet support the companies’
and their business. In this case, all active actors in the field are, with or without strategy,
working to shape the market in their favour. Mele, Pels and Storbacka (2015) supports this
by saying that companies should assume that the market will change and hence build a
strategy that supports this in order to manage quick turns if needed.
However, Gavetti et al. (2017) argue that market shaping done by a company will affect the
rest of the field, and besides reflect back to the starting company. A challenge here is that the
market can be overheated with several actors acting in a shaping manner and make the market
unpredictable. This can be seen as a demanding reality in the field for edible insects based
on the results, as the changes happening in the field are quick. The actors need to be alert and
in many cases proactive, however, if everyone is proactive and acting accordingly, it can alter
the market in an insecure manner.
The empirical result reveals, that marketing actions have been used before the market was
created and simultaneously as the market amends. Actions such as tastings, arranging events,
creating products and lobbying for the regulation to change have been common. This is
supported by theory that suggests that marketing alters the market through understanding the
customer needs and wants, and that marketing is involved before a market is made or changed
(Araujo 2007).
The result from the study showed, that the strategy for the interviewed companies included
creating tasty products to a reasonable price that are accessible. When analysing the results,
one can see that the companies so far have not yet fully achieved these. If a product is tasty
or not, is of course a personal opinion, but one can argue that work still needs to be done.
73

Tove Lindholm
The price range is at this moment perceived as too high and the products are according the
field experts not yet easily accessible.

7.2 Customers
As stated by West et al. (2006), marketing is the channel between the company and the
customers, which is seen in the answers by the interviewees. Particularly taking part in events
were said to be an important marketing action for the companies as the occasions supported
discussions with potential customers. One company mentioned that their customers often
contacts them with ideas and thoughts on product development, which indicates that the path
between company and customers works in a favourable manner.
Kotler et al. (2016) and Dibb et al. (2016), present that the marketing environment can be
divided in the micro- and macro-environment, where the micro-environment includes
stakeholders close to the core business and customer relationships, whereas the macroenvironment includes all phenomena and trends that influence the company on a wider scale.
Based on the results in the study, the interviewees where more or less able to name partners
or trends that affect their business. What can be seen in the micro-environment are customers
who are still not used to consuming insects, and hence a good amount of work is still to be
done to make insects as normal as vegetable protein sources. As one interviewee said, a
positive change in the market would be to add insects to the official food recommendations
and in that way support the growth of the market. Even though two of the respondents thought
that it might be too early for edible insects, the global trend regarding sustainable
development speaks otherwise. However, it might take time for trends that require change in
the perceptions of the mass to develop and hence the field for edible insects might take years
to develop.
The respondents said that it is still difficult to know exactly what the customer segments are
and how to reach out to them. One of the companies tried to produce products that would
appeal to as many as possible, while another tried to focus on a specific group more clearly.
Time will show what strategy works the best but according to theory, the company need to
understand who the customers are and communicate to them, as well as understand how to
74

Tove Lindholm
keep the customers they already have and engage with new potential customers (see Dibb et
al. 2016). Marketing does not only need to advertise the products, but also understand the
customer and strive to develop with the customer needs in mind (Kotler et al. 2016). The
results of the study showed the difficulty in defining who the target customer is. This is
because the field and the companies are new, but one can also argue that it is because people
from every possible segment have been a potential customer as so many have been interested
in trying the intriguing product that has been featured in the media. All respondents were
sceptic towards the hype partly created by the media as the market was not ready. The when
the interpretation of the regulation was changed all actors hastily developed new products,
which by a few respondents was intense. Theory implies that when shaping the market,
companies should start modestly partly because of not attracting too much attention from the
media. If media reports errors or other negativities, it might affect the market (see Kim &
Mauborgne 2018)
Some of the interviewees answered that the main customer that they can segment is a male
under 50 years who can afford buying costly new products that might still need to be
developed and lives in a city. This group can be defined as the early adaptor who is among
the first ones to try new interesting products. Children were by a few of the interviewees seen
as future highly potential customers and the elderly as an unexpected customer group. Araujo
(2007) argues that consumers who consider themselves as being part in a change of
something bigger are more prone to trying new products. People on the other hand who are
loyal to a brand or company can be more sceptic. Even though only one company at the point
of the interviews had a slightly more clear picture of their target customer, theory suggest
that a company active in market shaping needs to be clear in communication not only to
partners but also customers, in order to advise on new concepts (see Nenonen et al. 2019).
This might turn out difficult when the main customer segment is still to be defined.
According to Baker et al. (2016) market shaping activities can benefit from being kept similar
to an already existing market as the help consumers and other stakeholders adapt. The field
for edible insects lacks direct similarity to lean back on which makes it more difficult for
companies and actors to normalise insects. However, as many of the respondents answered,
75

Tove Lindholm
creating products that reminds of already existing products should be prioritised and
developed, instead of using the thrill that insects provoke in people.
The empirical result shows, that the actors actively promoting edible insects as part of human
diet, have done so by targeting the youth, include insects in common products, educate
consumers, striving for tasty products and in the future use partners in promoting insects.
These are all approaches that are mentioned by Raheem et al. (2017), however they also
included informing where to buy insects and how to use them. In Finland, the media has been
a main driver for the latter. Promoting insects as hidden in other products or showing them
as whole divided the respondents. House (2018) indicates that insects should be kept visible
to offer a clear selling argument to consumers why to buy a product and that consumers,
through seeing the insects, feel good about their choice. This on the other hand is opposed
by Collins et al. (2019) who argues that insects rather should not be visible. This shows that
whether or not to normalise insects as whole or hidden divides both researchers and
practitioners.

7.3 Competition
A division in focus area is to be noticed among the companies in the field, which happens as
a natural development when companies experiment in what works for them. The result
however showed a milder collaboration between companies than could have been expected.
This can be an aspect that Tuotantohyönteiset ry in the future can answer. When new markets
are being developed and changes it will in theory lead to actors agreeing on market-specific
rules. Such rules did not occur in the interviews to a great extent. However, all actors agreed
on that the common feeling between stakeholders was good. Some collaborated more than
others and the results show that the ones who collaborated more were more satisfied with the
collaboration and the solidarity. This is supported by theory where Araujo (2007) and Kotler
et al. (2016) argues that marketing needs a team with people with diverse backgrounds, and
the field can unify their vision and communication by working together.
Ben Letaifa (2014) presented a model for companies creating and capturing value (see
chapter 3.4). In the first phase companies create and ecosystem or network where they
76

Tove Lindholm
collaborate to create value and wok for the same goal. In the next phase they capture value
while creating it through collaboration. The third and fourth phase however do not create
value; the third phase still captures it without collaboration and in the fourth the network will
collapse as value is neither created nor captured and companies are no longer collaborating.
Based on the empirical results, the actors collaborated more when it was not yet legal to sell
insects and the actors strived for the same goal. When the regulation was changed, and the
market went through a hype the actors started competing more. On the other hand, now that
the market has calmed, the actors have come together through the association. This might
mean a boost for collaboration in order to create value for the field as a whole.
However, all interviewees agreed on competition being nothing but positive as it creates trust
for the field. This is supported by the theory, presenting that more actors promoting the same
product or service are stronger together and can reach out to a larger audience. (Nenonen and
Storbacka 2018) This is supported by Baker et al. (2016) who argues that several actors
forming a network is required to shape a market, together with possible changes in regulation.
In order for the field of edible insects to legally commence, it required a change in the
interpretation by the Finnish Food Authority, of the novel food regulation by the European
Union to include insects as food. This was mentioned as the most important driver for the
market to change.
The interview results show that all interviewees recognise the positive aspects in
collaborating. Furthermore, they all welcome more actors to the field as it provokes trust in
the field, although all companies expressed concern for any actor to blunder. This correlates
with theory by Nenonen et al. (2019) who propose that market shaping actions made by a
company should still be made even though they might benefit a competitor simultaneously.

7.4 Summary
In this chapter, the empirical findings were analysed based on the theoretical framework. The
results of the study defended the theoretical framework well and the interview guide
supported the methodology. The backgrounds of the interviewees were diverse although
sustainability and an urge to innovate were binding factors. The interviewees mentioned
various marketing actions that they had either done themselves or otherwise identified. Even
77

Tove Lindholm
though the persons taking part in this study have an extensive background and experience
regarding edible insects, the field is still new for them as well and all were still examining
the best solutions on how to proceed. As to sum up, the company representatives were not
able to present clear strategies on how the have been or are going to move forward. However,
all could answer the questions which indicates that they had a plan in mind, but it might not
have been defined as a strategy.

Conclusions

In the following chapter, the research results and analysis will be discussed further in
relation to the research questions. The aim is to find answers to the research questions that
support the purpose of the study. The chosen case-based research design focuses on
understanding the underlying thoughts and perceptions of each case, while examining the
theoretical framework against the research questions and problem discussion. The
discussion is followed by both theoretical and practical implications as well as limitations of
the study. Criticism towards the study will be presented as well as suggestions for
improvement. The chapter is completed with suggestions for further research.

8.1 Discussion
Edible insects as a field has made a spectacular entrance in Western countries as concern for
a sustainable food production and more ecological protein options are elaborated upon, and
the field is still shaping and evolving. Finland, a small country in the North, being one of the
forerunners developing the field in many aspects such as developing the process and products
and changing consumer perception on including insects in their diet, is fascinating. However,
studying how a new market is shaping did prove challenging. Since the field is new and
small, comprehensive conclusions are demanding to make since the sample is small and the
company strategies are still under construction. Theory regarding market shaping mainly
concentrate on big companies, offering insight on how companies with adequate resources
have shaped or should shape the market. Marketing with scarce resources sets limitations to
what kind of actions can be made and to what extent. Notwithstanding, studying a small field
with, for the time being, small companies offer a convenient impression on varied actions
taken by actors about to shape the market. Moreover, it requires creativity from the actors to
reach set goals with limited resources.
In the following section, I strive to present the empirical analysis according to the research
questions presented in the introduction. This way, a comprehensive description of the results
is portrayed in an uncomplicated way, linking the purpose of the thesis with the empirical
findings. The research questions presented in the introduction of this thesis are:
79

Tove Lindholm

How is a new market created, and how is it shaped?
What is the strategy behind shaping a market?
How do marketing actions contribute to market shaping?
As briefly stated in the introduction, the problem is formulated based on data and extensive
research with the purpose of generating one more piece of knowledge to the field (Alvehus
2018: 20). The above questions have been in the centre of not only the theoretical framework
but also the methodological study conducted by qualitative interviews. Further emphasis was
placed on entomophagy generally and the new market for edible insects in Finland.
How is a new market created, and how is it shaped?
The field for edible insects in Finland is a good example of a market being created from the
very beginning. This indicates that markets are not stable places that cannot be changed.
Based on the empirical analysis, for a market to be created it requires not only one but many
actors with the same vision who work together for the same goal. These actors have to unite
to create a stronger foundation and through it make an impact. In this case, creating the
market and shaping it faced different obstacles. In the creation phase, the biggest challenge
was to achieve an update in how the novel food regulation was interpreted and legalise selling
insects for human food. In the shaping phase, in which the field is now, the most significant
obstacle lies in psychology and habits of people. The actors face consumers who are not yet
used to the thought of consuming insects as part of their normal diet. A challenge that
appeared in the shaping phase, is that consumers seem to have accepted a higher price when
the field and products were new and exciting. Now, when many already have tasted insects,
the novelty feeling has faded, and the majority is no longer eager to pay a premium price.
This creates a demanding environment for the small companies, of which many do not have
the possibility to lower prices. This indicates, that focusing on consumers who have the
required interest combined with funds to create a demand and hence a market, is to prefer.
Without a high enough demand, and supply to meet the demand, a market cannot exist
successfully.
80

Tove Lindholm

For a market to develop, the product must feel both exciting and be easy to access and adopt
at the same time. Consumers also need to feel the importance of the product as it fills a
demand or offers an alternative to something else already existing. Moreover, companies
must take into consideration creating products that does not necessarily contribute to their
main philosophy if it in turn aids in creating the market, as one product might work better as
an introduction to the field than others, even if it means slightly stepping away from solving
the focal issue. Edible insects are not a new product per se, as insects have been consumed
in different parts of the world throughout history. However, as it has been uncommon to
consume insects in Finland before, insects can be considered as a new product for this market.
Companies that produce insects for human consumption have had to invent different ways of
presenting the product, and to observe the potential customers in what way they are most
likely to first try the product and later buy it.
The market for edible insects can either be viewed as a new market of its own, or just a part
of all foodstuffs. If placed in its own category, the field can be evaluated as newly created
from a market making perspective and compared with other similar fields such as hemp. In
this comparison, both fields have entered the Finnish market recently and have been
struggling with sceptic perceptions and strict regulation. In the latter case, this area leans
more strongly towards the concept of market shaping in which the field can be viewed from
a broader perspective and compared to other market shaping products such as “pulled oats”.
Both products, pulled oats and edible insects, provide a new source for protein that is more
sustainable than conventional meat. Depending on from what angle one choses to observe
the field for edible insects, it creates different challenges. If perceiving the field as unique
and a stand-alone field, it is demanding to locate customer segments as there is neither
previous data nor experience regarding most potential customers. On the other hand, if
placing the field for edible insects as an expanded, but still part of, area of foodstuffs, it
changes the structure and other angles for customer segments are discovered. In this case,
customers can be found in similar areas of products offering alternative sources of protein,
and benchmarks may be found. This implies, that a change in mindset and angle from which

81

Tove Lindholm
a market is seen can prove beneficial and offer fragments of insight into the market
impression.
Unifying for the actors in the field for edible insects in Finland, is that they all view the
market as shapeable. The actors have started with a thought to either create something new
or offer a solution to an existing problem. This is fundamental for actors seeking to shape or
create a market. Moving away from viewing the market as fixed, erases invisible boundaries
surrounding the market, and allows for disruptive strategies to be created and used.
What is the strategy behind shaping a market?
In the case of edible insects in Finland, the companies’ strategies at this point can be said to
be shaped in the same pace as the market itself. As progress takes place, it shapes the market
and makes the actors choose direction. The actors are highly responsible for what happens in
the market, even though larger entities on the macro-level make a difference that the actors
cannot mould in the same way. Based on the data analysis, the strategy behind shaping a
market does not necessarily need to be defined in order to work, at least not in new market.
The result shows that markets can be shaped by small actors working together towards the
same goal and does not need to be shaped by big actors or companies. However, when big
companies take part in the market shaping process the market benefits and might take a bigger
leap forward. Nonetheless, if a big company decides to withdraw from the market it will
express the market not being trustworthy and might harm the progress. Thus, once deciding
to take part in shaping activities it is favourable to finalise the strategy, and carefully evaluate
whether the company benefits from market shaping activities. Nevertheless, being able to
change course when realising that the calculated strategy is not working in the company’s
favour, also is a valuable decision from the single company point of view. It might however,
not prove advantageous from the market perspective.
The study indicated that the process requires actors who are eager to shape the market to
improve business, and who sees the market as shapeable. As long as business is unprofitable,
alterations needs to be considered to make a change in the situation and improve business.
82

Tove Lindholm
Even though this study did not focus on consumers and their role in market shaping, the
results implied that the role of consumers is important. The field for edible insects is still
small and as the result shows, all actors are equally important in raising awareness of edible
insects, and consumers play an active part. Activating consumers in marketing actions can
hence be recommended for future strategies.
Products, or services, are at the core of a market shaping strategy too, as it is the products
that builds the business offers and stands at the core of creating value. The results pointed
out, that companies who had a business plan on how to proceed and what to focus on, and a
realistic impression of how long it takes for a market to change tolerated market fluctuations
best. Further, strongly believing in the product together with an experienced team were corner
stones in a successful market shaping strategy. Actors who recognise that market shaping can
take several years before showing expected results, are better equipped in the process. They
build their strategies on modest achievements and set long-term goals instead of striving for
fast results and immediate growth.
Compared to traditional strategic marketing where markets are seen as constant, a market
shaping strategy identifies the market as alterable. This poses requirements on the strategy to
be proactive and take various scenarios into consideration. The marketing strategy, that goes
into more detail than the corporate strategy, should include comprehensive information on
who the target customer is, what the company seeks to achieve in the long run, and what kind
of added value the company can provide the market, to name a few. Furthermore, the strategy
needs to be agile and easily adaptable to changing circumstances, in order to maintain
business and not only stay afloat but be successful. Reflecting on the study results and data
analysis, one can conclude that actors who have the capability to innovate while focusing on
the main goal and striving to create added value for the market, are strong market shapers.
Ability to critically evaluate own products and company development, and make analysed
decisions based on data and experience are crucial for a successful market shaping strategy.

83

Tove Lindholm
How do marketing actions contribute to market shaping?
Based on the data analysis and the theoretical framework, one can conclude that markets do
change even without a well-articulated marketing strategy or market shaping strategy.
However, what is needed is collaboration between different actors who passionately strive
for the same goal. Moreover, in this field one can see that marketing actions have been present
long before the initial change in the market made the market for edible insects develop.
Marketing is important but as the companies are small, actions are modest. When media is
not actively publishing articles about edible insects to the same extent as previously, the field
soon experienced a gap in visibility followed by feelings of decline. This proves the strength
in marketing communication. Even though marketing in new markets is possible and
recommended for small companies, back-up from both media and bigger companies are to
prefer, implying that joined forces are stronger than one actor alone. Building a network of
actors with the same vision aids in combining forces and gaining a far bigger visibility and
knowledge about the field. Particularly in small fields with small actors, coopetition
regarding marketing actions are positive. As noticed in the results, the biggest challenge for
the field no longer is to improve knowledge about insects as a product, but instead
normalising the use of it. The actors work on including insects as part of a normal diet and
convince consumers to not only try the products once but keep buying the products.
Since the field is new to Finland, companies and field experts have little solid data on who
the most potential customers are and creating a clear customer profile is still challenging.
This makes marketing actions difficult to target in order to reach the most potential
customers. Hence, putting effort on clarifying customer segments and building customer
profiles is crucial. Marketing is most beneficial when reaching the target audience with a
focused message that they most likely will identify themselves with. Actors can only use a
generalised marketing strategy to a certain degree, but when striving for the best return on
investment a clear focus needs to be set. This comes down to the produced content, how the
message is communicated and what channels are used to reach the target customers. All this
while taking the limited resources into consideration. This indicates, that companies need to
84

Tove Lindholm
choose the customer segments they desire to focus on and direct their limited resources to
the specific groups for highest return on investment.
The empirical data analysis indicates, that marketing is, if not the most eminent, one of the
critical areas to focus on when shaping a market. Both theory and the study show, that various
marketing paths are to be developed and different channels used in order to figure out the
most profitable one. Building a network of both competitors, partners, customers and a
skilled inside team stands as a foundation for successful market shaping marketing. As
marketing actions, as stated previously, exists even before a market is created or shaped,
marketing is not to be excluded from a successful strategy. Marketing plays an important role
in creating demand, even though marketing cannot replace an otherwise questionable
strategy. Well executed marketing actions creates value both for the customer, the company
and for the market.
Moreover, what can be observed based on the empirical results is that marketing actions
changes in nature as the market shapes. Marketing goes from being provocative in the
beginning of creating or shaping a market, to modest when the market shaping process is
ongoing. However, the sample is small and thus conclusions regarding marketing actions
changing form cannot be drawn on a general level. When analysing the results, I could not
help but recognising features of guerrilla marketing in a market shaping environment. Most
marketing actions committed within the field for edible insects in the beginning of the
shaping process were provocative and executed with a limited budget. The marketing actions
included events and promoting products, of which not all were legitimate, and creating
extensive publicity through digital content, mostly by media. In guerrilla marketing, markets
are not perceived as static and hence more or less radical activities with the goal of shaping
the market are used. This can be seen in the studied field as guerrilla marketing characteristics
resembles then ones of market shaping.

8.2 Theoretical implications
Through the empirical study, this thesis has contributed to the earlier theoretical findings
about market shaping and to what extent marketing is contributing to changing a new market.
85

Tove Lindholm
As this study focused on how a market is shaped but chose to study a new market that still is
in the early phase of shaping, it was clear to see that market creation is one radical form of
market shaping as the theory implied. Through the chosen focus area, contributions to
entomophagy has been made in the form of studying how the specific field in a specific area
has acted in shaping the market.
Although it seems like change is the new constant, there has not been much research on how
markets shape, neither on edible insects. This study may hence contribute to the theoretical
field by providing insight in how especially new markets are shaped. Focus was in this study
placed on marketing, but as marketing is a fundamental part of a company it was blended
with theories on strategic levels within companies, aiming at covering essential parts of
market shaping.
This thesis can hopefully be beneficial for small companies striving for either creating a new
market or shaping a market. Theory and empirical findings have been compiled in a compact
format, addressing the issues with market shaping. The empirical findings have addressed
both challenges and possibilities that small companies face, both regarding market creation
and market shaping. Hence, especially small companies or start-ups that are pondering how
to proceed and what processes to undergo, will most likely benefit from a study like this.

8.3 Practical implications
Based on the previous chapters including theory and empirical study, I have made a few
observations. When shaping a market, companies need to have resources to await the change
in the market to reach the targeted point. A market shaping process can take years, and
companies who do not possess the capability to withstand the slow development will
struggle. The resources needed are not only monetary but to a high degree also mental.
Companies who believe in their business and products and have a pragmatic attitude towards
business growth seem to have an advantage compared to companies with the opposite starting
point.

86

Tove Lindholm
Investing in a skilled team and being part of a larger network are influential factors in a
market shaping strategy. The network holds more experience, skills, and resources than one
actor alone and working together to create value will result in the companies capturing value.
Marketing plays an important role in shaping and creating a market. Companies need to strive
to solve a concrete problem and offer a solution to an existing dilemma. Delving into the core
obstacles that both the consumers or the ecosystem are facing and solving them, proposes
possible growth opportunities. Marketing is the hotline between the company and the
customers and hence marketing action should not only go in one direction from the company
to the customers. Rather, the company needs to actively strive to listen to even small calls
from the customers in order to understand who the customer is and what problems she might
have. Incorporating the customer in product development is recommendable, as by doing so
the company may build a stronger customer bond while at the same time receiving first-hand
tips and suggestions for further development. This could aid in creating added value both for
the companies and their customers. Value is at the core of shaping a new market; if the
consumers cannot see the added value provided by the companies and their products,
business will not succeed.

8.4 Limitations
Since the companies that are active in the field for edible insects are small and young, it
became clear that they might not have lacked the resources to construct a business strategy
for their company. Moreover, without a business strategy, a focused marketing strategy is
challenging to create as it must be interlinked with the business strategy. The strategy in
unison for the companies at this point was mainly to attract potential customers and convince
them that insects taste good and are good for both you and the environment. The companies,
as they are small, seldom have a dedicated person to develop marketing, not to mention a
marketing department.
The sample for the study was limited, and the interviewees chosen by me. Somebody else
might have had chosen other respondents which in turn could have given another result. Since
the chosen method for the study was semi-structured interviews, the same results might not
87

Tove Lindholm
be able to achieve if made by another researcher. The study could also have focused solely
on companies, both active and companies that have already quit, for a more focused result,
instead of including both company representatives and field experts. A limitation with a casebased research design is that the result might not be consistent when remaking the study.
Moreover, the interpersonal relationships between interviewer and interviewee can differ,
and the analysis is made from my perspective.

8.5 Suggestion for further research
The field for edible insects in Finland can be seen from a smaller perspective as a new market
that has been developed during the latest years. This is the perspective I have chosen to base
y study on. On the other hand, the field can be seen as a part of a bigger context where all
foodstuffs are included, where edible insects are challenging, for example, the meat industry
as a subcategory. This could be an interesting angle for further research within the field.
Therefore, as a suggestion for further research, I would propose studying the field for edible
insects as a new competitor in a bigger market. The perspective could, in that case, be how
actors within, for example, the meat, milk, or egg industry perceive edible insects as a
competitor.
An alternative approach to study the topic is by choosing another suitable field of interest,
either in Finland or abroad, and examine similarities or differences. In Finland, the fairly new
field for hemp farming and production would be an interesting field as it resembles the field
for edible insects, both in novelty and controversy.
Another interesting angle to examine market shaping in would be to study the interaction
between marketing and sales. One could study how market shaping actions correlates with
sales results and hence combine the two fields for a comprehensive result. This could be done
through a one-case study, examining the marketing actions made by an actor and mirror it on
increased, decreased on neutral sales results.

Svensk sammanfattning

MARKNADSFÖRINGENS ROLL DÅ NYA MARKNADER OMFORMAS:
EN STUDIE OM ÄTBARA INSEKTER I FINLAND
Inledning
Marknader är konstruerade av mänsklig handling och kan således även formas och utvecklas
av människan. Utan mänsklig aktivitet skulle inga marknader existera och då företag inser
detta kan de se på marknaden de är aktiva i med nya ögon. En marknad inte bara är, utan
förändras kontinuerligt beroende på de olika aktiva aktörerna. En marknad kan vara både en
fysisk plats, till exempel ett torg, eller ett virtuellt rum där efterfrågan möter tillgång. För att
en marknad ska kunna existera måste utöver dessa krav även möjligheten att förvärva en vara
eller tjänst uppnås. Exempelvis kan ingen produkt eller tjänst säljas om inte köparen har
tillgångar.
En marknadsföringsstrategi, eller strategi i allmänhet, är inte huggen i sten och kan således
ändras på om läget så kräver. Således bör inte samma marknadsföringsstrategi användas för
olika situationer än den som den är planerad för. Då målet med en marknadsföringsstrategi
främst är att åstadkomma tillväxt, kan man argumentera för det positiva i att utveckla flera
alternativa strategier för en oförutsägbar framtid. En traditionell marknadsföringsstrategi
granskar marknaden som given och något som inte kan ändras på utan till vilken företaget
måste anpassa sig. Om marknaden emellertid inte är gynnsam för företaget kan det vara skäl
att tänka om.
Hållbar utveckling kan inte anses vara en övergående trend på basis av den information vi
besitter i nuläget. Då jordens population fortsätter att växa bör fokus i högre grad sättas på
hur vi lever. Ett sätt att minska sitt koldioxidavtryck är att minska på mängden kött man
konsumerar. Alternativa proteinkällor existerar redan, som de mer traditionella baljväxterna
samt moderna uppfinningar som exempelvis pulled havre. År 2017 ändrade Finland sin
tolkning av Europeiska Unionens ”Novel Food Regulation” gällande ätbara insekter, och det
blev lagligt att tillverka och sälja insekter kommersiellt. Insekter innehåller förutom protein
89

Tove Lindholm
även aminosyror och vitaminer som människan behöver. Ett problem är dock att finländarna,
som de flesta andra i Europa, inte är vana vid att äta insekter. Finländare är dock relativt
positiva inställda till att beakta insekter som ett födoämne.
Syfte och forskningsfrågor
I denna avhandling ämnar jag att granska problemet genom att studera vilken roll
marknadsföringen har då nya marknader förändras och koppla teorin till området för ätbara
insekter i Finland. I den teoretiska referensramen behandlar jag hur en marknad förändras
med fokus på hur finländska aktörer aktiva inom området för ätbara insekter har påverkat
och förändrat den nya marknaden. Då detta är ett nytt område är det intressant att granska det
mer ingående ur ett marknadsföringsperspektiv. Hur borde marknaden förändras och vilka
utmaningar har man stött på? Syftet är att kartlägga handlingar och åtgärder, mer specifikt
gällande marknadsföring, utförda av både företag som säljer ätbara insekter för konsumtion
och andra experter inom området.
Problemet som denna avhandling ämnar granska är vilken roll marknadsföring spelar då nya
marknader förändras och uppstår. Frågor som avhandlingen har för avsikt att svara på är:
Hur uppstår en ny marknad och hur förändras den?
En hurudan företagsstrategi ligger bakom förändring av en marknad?
Hur bidrar marknadsföringsaktivitet till förändring av en marknad?
Den teoretiska referensramen stöder forskningsfrågorna för att ge en övergripande bild över
ämnet. Genom att kombinera teori med en kvalitativ forskningsmetod ämnar jag svara på
forskningsfrågorna.
Syftet med avhandlingen är att studera hur marknadsföring har medverkat i utformningen
och förändringen av marknaden för ätbara insekter i Finland. Jag letar efter svar främst för
detta område men är även intresserad av att granska huruvida resultaten kan tillämpas på
andra nya marknader. Orsaken bakom att rikta in mig på marknaden för ätbara insekter i

90

Tove Lindholm
Finland istället för en annan nyskapad marknad är delvis på grund av personligt intresse och
delvis på grund av geografiskt läge.
Teoretisk referensram
Marknader kan betraktas på olika sätt om än att betrakta dem som rika och enhetliga är att
föredra ur ett marknadsförändringsperspektiv. Detta innebär att en marknad betraktas som ett
flexibelt system som inkluderar ett flertal olika aktörer i motsats till att inkludera enbart
säljare och köpare, samt att värde tillförs då konsumenten använder produkten eller tjänsten
till skillnad från att anse att värde skapas enbart då produkten eller tjänsten säljs. Till
yttermera visso, är strategins roll bredare och betonar värdeskapande för både kunder och
andra aktörer framom tillväxt och position gentemot konkurrenter.
Marknadsföringsstrategin är en del av företagsstrategin och kan såtillvida gå in på detaljnivå,
innehållande bland annat produkter, värdeskapande och kampanjer. Marknadsföringens
ansvar är att föra samman kundernas och företagets intressen samt uppnå mål utvecklade för
företaget. Marknadsföringsavdelningen är beroende av resurser givna i företagsstrategin
varför marknadsföringen bör medverka då företagsstrategin sammanfattas.
En marknadsföringsstrategi kan med fördel uppdateras i fall företaget märker att den inte för
dem åt rätt håll eller om marknaden förändras. Marknader förändras ofrånkomligen då olika
aktörer är aktiva och nya möjligheter uppstår. Marknadsföring är således närvarande och
verksamt redan innan en marknad förändras eller skapas. För att hantera en strategi som
fokuserar på marknadsförändring, bör företag fokusera på hur man ska utlösa samt
genomföra en förändring. Detta kan ske genom att rikta in sig på att omskapa språk genom
att erbjuda nya ord, eventuellt påverka regleringar genom verksamhet som kräver
myndigheter uppmärksamhet, erbjuda nätverket av kunder och konkurrenter möjlighet att
medverka i marknaden samt att tänka om gällande produktutveckling. Företag som anser att
marknaden är given och icke-föränderlig konstruerar en strategi som håller företaget i
säkerhet och drar nytta av befintliga möjligheter. Företag som däremot ser marknaden som
föränderlig konstruerar en förutseende strategi som för företaget i önskad riktning mot en
situation som gynnar företaget. De sistnämnda företagen är de som visar vägen och
övervinner hinder med större sannolikhet.
91

Tove Lindholm

Förändring av marknader inkluderar både förändring av en redan existerande marknad och
skapandet av ny marknad. Då en ny marknad skapas är det alltså en form av
marknadsförändring, om än en mer dramatisk variant. Marknadsförändring är inte enkom
stora företag förunnat och även små företag kan förändra marknader. För att en marknad
däremot ska förändras krävs ofta ett samspel mellan olika aktörer som strävar efter samma
mål, alternativt slumpmässigt genom självständiga val påverkar en förändring. I fall
förändringen är omfattande kan en mer dämpad strategi vara att föredra som tillåter att både
det gamla och det nya tillvägagångssättet används simultant under en övergångsperiod. Till
marknadsförändring hör inte situationer då företag utökar sin marknadsandel av en
existerande marknad eller då företaget träder in på en ny marknad med befintliga produkter.
En ny marknad kan förändras eller skapas genom att ett företag erbjuder en lösning på ett
existerande problem eller finner en lösning på ett problem ingen visste om. Alternativt kan
företaget fokusera på ett existerande problem men hantera det från en ny vinkel. Detta kan
attrahera kunder från andra företag samt kunder som annars inte hade tagit denna marknad i
beaktande över huvud taget. Marknadsförändring tar dock tid, oftast flera år, och företag bör
därför anta en långsiktig strategi och inte invänta genomslag direkt. Eftersom det är krävande
att förändra en marknad är det viktigt att invänta bästa möjliga tillfälle; att förändra en
marknad som genomgår någon form av turbulens kan vara att föredra. Å andra sidan spelar
även tur en stor roll i huruvida strategin är framgångsrik.
Marknadsförändrande strategier fokuserar på nätverket av aktörer, ser på produkterna med
nya ögon och ur kundens synvinkel, kan tvingas inverka på lagstiftning, funderar ut nya
kommunikationsmetoder och även nya ord och inkluderar konkurrenter. Främst av allt
strävar marknadsförändring efter att skapa mervärde.
Metodik
I denna avhandling har jag valt den kvalitativa forskningsmetoden som mest lämplig för
syftet med studien. Grundorsaken till detta beslut är min strävan efter att ta del av de
individuella aktörernas tankar och åsikter samt möjligheten att gå in på djupet med
resultatanalysen gällande respondenternas unika svar. Som metodform används
92

Tove Lindholm
semistrukturerade intervjuer där intervjun utgår ifrån en på förhand utvecklad
intervjuguidebok. Intervjuerna utförs som personliga intervjuer där jag intervjuar en person
åt gången. Frågor i en semistrukturerad intervju behöver inte nödvändigtvis ställas i samma
ordning i samtliga intervjusituationer, utan kan ställas i olik ordning beroende på
intervjuobjektet och flödet i intervjun. Intervjun strävar dock till att svara på avhandlingens
forskningsfrågor och kan således inte jämföras med en diskussion.
En skillnad mellan en kvantitativ och en kvalitativ forskningsmetod är att en kvalitativ metod
ger mer rum för individuella synpunkter och forskaren kommer in på djupet med den
intervjuade. En kvantitativ metod fokuserar däremot på mätbara teorier och data. En
kvalitativ forskningsmetod ger mer rum för individualitet även vad gäller analys av resultatet
och kan således vara neutral endast till en viss grad. Resultatet kan, beroende av syfte med
studien, analyseras antingen från ett innehållsperspektiv eller genom att även granska
interaktion i detalj. Bästa förutsättningen för en djupgående analys av kvalitativt material ger
ett inspelat och transkriberat material. Bandspelare är således vid mån av möjlighet att
föredra framför anteckningar under intervjutillfället, trots bandspelarens misslyckande i att
uppta kroppsspråk och icke-verbal kommunikation. Intervjuerna i denna avhandling spelades
in och transkriberades.
För denna avhandling intervjuades sammanlagt åtta personer varav fyra representerar
producerande företag och fyra är experter inom området för ätbara insekter i Finland.
Personerna handplockades för denna avhandling på basis av deras expertis.
Resultatpresentation
Samtliga intervjuer började med en lättsam fråga gällande respondenternas bakgrund och vad
som ledde dem in på området för ätbara insekter. Under intervjun framkom olika
bakomliggande orsaker till valet av inriktning samt yrkesval varav de mest framstående var
hållbar utveckling, hållbar konsumtion och matproduktion, framtidsfokus, klimatförändring,
vilja att utvecklas samt strävan efter att delta i utvecklandet av en ny hållbar bransch. Alla
ansåg att ätbara insekter är en del av framtiden och såg potential i området för ätbara insekter,
både ur ett mindre företagsperspektiv och ett större miljöperspektiv.
93

Tove Lindholm

Intervjun fortsatte sedan med ett mer strategiskt fokus. Här ställdes frågorna på lite
varierande vis beroende på om respondenten representerade ett företag eller var expert inom
området. Företagsrepresentanterna svarade utifrån företagets perspektiv medan experterna
gav sina svar ur ett större perspektiv genom att betrakta företagen och marknaden som
helheter. Eftersom området för ätbara insekter tillsvidare är litet hade inget av företagen en
specifik företagsstrategi för hur de ämnade påverka marknaden. Vad som dock framgick
under intervjuerna var företagens strävan efter en försiktig start genom att betrakta genmälet
från kunderna och marknaden för att se vad som fungerar. Företagen önskade även att
utvecklingen skulle vara försynt och marknaden skulle växa stadigt men behärskat. Alla
respondenter nämnde även den enorma medieuppståndelsen för drygt två år sedan då Finland
ändrade sin tolkning gällande EU-lagstiftningen och tillät försäljning av ätbara insekter för
konsumenter. Ätbara insekter var då på allas läppar och media skildrade företeelsen frekvent.
Detta var dock en jäktig tid för företagen då de inte kunde svara på efterfrågan. Experterna
som intervjuades nämnde även denna period men såg mer positivt tillbaka på den.
Då företagen är små har inte heller omfattande resurser kunnat sättas på marknadsföring.
Företagen underströk dock vikten av välfungerande webbplats och nätbutik där den främsta
bakomliggande orsaken låg i marknader utanför Finland. Därutöver utnyttjades sociala
medier, muntlig kommunikation, olika evenemang, distributionskanalers marknadsföring
samt gemensamma eller marknadsomfattande projekt. Evenemang där kunder anträffas
direkt ansågs viktiga i detta skede då företagen dels enkelt kommer i kontakt med kunder och
får direkt respons dels kan erbjuda potentiella kunder smakprov och på så vis vinna kunders
förtroende och smak för insekter. Samtliga företag nämnde att de strävar efter att få finländare
att tycka att insekter är goda som ett grundläggande mål. Som största kundgrupp nämnde
företagen män i åldersgruppen 25 till 50, om än samtliga underströk att de ännu inte hunnit
samla tillräckliga data för att kunna bekräfta detta. Kundsegmenten var även tillsvidare
diffusa vilket försvårade en målinriktad marknadsföring. Respondenterna ansåg att
finländare överlag har tagit till sig ätbara insekter väl och att Finland är en föregångare både
vad gäller reglering och marknadsrepresentation. Finländare betraktades dock som tudelade
vad gäller inställning till insekter som föda; en del provar gärna och anser det vara bra, andra
94

Tove Lindholm
tycker att insekter inte passar som mat. En stötesten ansågs dock vara bristen på kunskap om
hur man som konsument kan använda insekter i matlagning, och tillsvidare saknas
matprodukter som är enkla att tillaga.
Många företag, både sådana som förädlat och sådana som odlat insekter, har hunnit gå i
konkurs sedan starten. På frågan om varför de företag som de intervjuade representerar ännu
är aktiva svarade både företagen och experterna att det kan bero på företagens strävan efter
att utvecklas måttligt och hållbart. Ingen nämnde att de eftertraktade snabba vinster om än de
olika företagens ambitioner och resurser låg på olika nivå.
Eftersom marknaden för ätbara insekter är ny måste aktörerna inom området utmana sig
själva konstant. Detta ansåg respondenterna förverkligas naturligt eftersom företagen
oavbrutet måste utveckla sig och sina produkter i en riktning som tilltalar kunder. Ur
respondenternas svar framkom mer eller mindre samarbete företagen emellan, dock nämnde
samtliga uppkomsten av föreningen Tuotantohyönteiset ry (Produktionsinsekter rf, egen
översättning) för ett drygt år sedan, vars mål är fungera som informationskanal inom området
de olika aktörerna emellan.
Analys
Sociala medier utnyttjades både som marknadsföringskanal av företagen via deras egna
konton men även individer som testade produkterna delade flitigt med sig av sin upplevelse.
Detta kan knytas samman med teorin om att skapa värde tillsammans. Värde skapas inte
längre endast vid köptillfället utan fortsätter att skapas efteråt då kunden använder produkten.
Individen gynnas då hon kan tala om för sin vänkrets vad hon har varit med om. Företaget
gynnas då information om deras produkt sprids och når nya potentiella kunder. Marknaden
gynnas då kännedom om utbudet och området som helhet växer. Att skapa mervärde kan
således i bästa fall anses främja alla aktörer inom samma område där samtliga drar nytta av
situationen.
Man kan märka en fördelning i fokusområde hos företagen, vilket sker som en naturlig
utveckling då företagen provar sig fram gällande vad som fungerar och passar dem. Ur
resultatet framkom dock ett mindre samarbete företagen emellan än vad som kunde ha
95

Tove Lindholm
förväntats. Detta kan vara en aspekt Tuotantohyönteiset ry kan svara på. Då nya marknader
förändras leder det enligt teorin ofta till att aktörerna kommer överens om marknadsspecifika
regler. Dylika regler framkom inte i intervjuerna. Alla respondenter var dock överens, om än
eventuellt ovetande om varandras åsikt, om att alla företag måste erbjuda kunder
välsmakande produkter, värna om hygien samt undvika skandaler.
Inriktningen på området för ätbara insekter där företagen tillsvidare är små, stöder litteraturen
om att även små aktörer kan förändra en marknad. På grund av att resurserna är små kan det
ta längre tid men all marknadsföringsaktivitet bidrar till marknadsförändring. Skapandet och
förändringen av detta område har dock stötts av aktivitet från större företag och institutioner.
Som exempel kan nämnas Fazers lansering av syrsbröd, ändringar i reglering samt
mediebevakning.
Diskussion
Resultatanalysen speglas här mot forskningsfrågorna som har gett avhandlingen dess
struktur. Utifrån resultatanalysen kan man dra slutsatsen att marknader förändras även utan
en välartikulerad marknadsföringsstrategi. Vad som krävs är dock ett samspel olika aktörer
emellan som passionerat strävar efter samma mål. Även inom detta område kan man se att
marknadsföring i olika former har varit aktiv långt innan själva området för ätbara insekter
utvecklades till allmän kännedom.
Området för ätbara insekter i Finland kan ses som en egen ny marknad som skapats de senaste
åren. Detta perspektiv har jag valt att utgå ifrån i denna studie. Å andra sidan kan området
betraktas som en del i en större helhet där alla födoämnen ingår, där ätbara insekter är en
utmanare av exempelvis köttindustrin. Detta kunde vara en intressant vinkel att vidare studera
ämnet ifrån. Som förslag på vidare forskning skulle jag således förslå att området för ätbara
insekter i Finland skulle studeras som en utmanare inom en större marknad. Perspektivet
kunde då vara hur aktörer aktiva inom exempelvis kött-, mjölk- och äggproduktion uppfattar
ätbara insekter.
