Abstract
The 2.6 Ga Siilinjärvi alkali complex is one of the oldest carbonatite-glimmerite
deposits in the world and is currently being mined by Yara Suomi Oy in two open
mine pits. The older granitic and gneissic bedrock has been metasomatically altered
to fenite due to the alkali fluids released during the formation of the
carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion. Dioritic and metadiabase dykes intersect the
Siilinjärvi alkali complex in a northwestern-southeastern orientation.
The aim of this thesis is to identify the mineral assemblages and microtextures of the
known fenite types in Siilinjärvi and to observe local variations between fenite in
different parts of the studied area. Field mapping and sample collecting was
conducted of the entire northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. A total of 17
thin sections were examined in this thesis with optical microscopy and micro-XRF in
order to characterise the geochemical and petrological variations in the different
fenite types. The categorisation of fenites according to their fenitisation grades has
been adapted in this thesis. It is used to explain the fenitisation stages during the
formation of different fenites with different grades.
The results show that the medium-grade fenite, composed of K-feldspar (microcline
or orthoclase) and aegirine-augite, is the most common. High-grade fenites are found
near the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion and consist largely of K-feldspar, perthite
and blue amphibole. The low-grade fenites are least affected by the alkali
metasomatism and are a mix of fenitic and gneissic minerals and textures.
Microtextures in the medium-grade fenites show albitisation of primary and
secondary K-feldspar, signifying that both potassium and sodium have been present
in the fenitisation. The two alkalis (potassium and sodium) have also produced two
distinct high-grade fenites consisting of either blue amphibole and perthite (Na-fenite)
or mantle-textured K-feldspar, aegirine-augite and iron oxides (K-fenite).

1 Introduction
The Siilinjärvi alkali complex is a lenticular carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion located
in the municipality of Siilinjärvi, 20 km north of Kuopio in eastern Finland. Today
the mining of the carbonatite-glimmerite for extraction of the phosphorus bearing
mineral apatite is active under the ownership of Yara Suomi Oy. The mining for
apatite takes place in two open pit mines, in the main open pit, Särkijärvi, and in the
northern satellite pit called Saarinen.
The core of the 2.6 Ga complex consists of rocks belonging to the
carbonatite-glimmerite series. The complex runs in an N-S direction and the main
carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion is estimated to be 16 km long and 900 m wide
(O’Brien, 2015). The depth of the intrusion has been confirmed to 700 metres.
Surrounding the entire intrusion is a fenite aureole, which forks into two branches in
the northern part of the complex. The fenite aureole formed due to alkali
metasomatism, induced by the intrusion, that fenitised the 2.8 Ga basement gneiss.
The fenite is comprised of alkaline feldspar, pyroxene and alkali amphibole.
Crosscutting the complex are mafic dykes, which are dioritic to doleritic in
composition.
The purpose of this study is to define and characterise the fenite lithology in the
northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. This was done by field mapping and
sampling along with thin section and micro-XRF analysis. The different fenites are
the result of different grades of fenitisation. The hypothesis is that these differences
can be observed as mineralogical and petrographical differences between fenites and
are correlated to the fenite’s spatial relation with the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion.
It is assumed that the low-grade fenites would be least affected by desilication and
high-grade fenites would resemble an igneous syenite. These aforementioned fenite
types are observed in other alkaline and carbonatite complexes (Kresten, 1988;
LeBas, 2008; Morogan, 1994; Vartiainen & Woolley, 1976).
The approximately 8 km2-sized study area consists mainly of fenite and basement
gneiss with some mafic dykes crosscutting the main lithologies. Some
carbonatite-glimmerite series rocks are also present. The main characteristic in the
northern part of the complex are the two distinct fenite branches, the western and
1

eastern branch. Within the western fenite branch there are ore-bearing
carbonatite-glimmerite rocks, which are the source for the alkaline fluids that have
caused the fenitisation of the basement gneiss. The ore-bearing rocks seem to be
absent in the eastern branch. The structures in the study area are primarily vertical to
subvertical and striking NNW to SSE.

2 Geological outline
2.1 Basement gneiss
The Siilinjärvi carbonatite complex intruded into 2.8 Ga migmatitic basement gneiss,
which is a part of the basement gneiss complex of Eastern Finland (Fig. 1). The
basement gneiss is geochemically mostly a tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG)
migmatitic gneiss along with granitoids classified as granodioritic to quartz-dioritic
in composition. The migmatite gneiss is heterogeneous with large areas varying
between paleosome-dominated banded gneiss to leucocratic gneisses with migmatitic
textures. It is unclear if the migmatite gneiss is of sedimentary or magmatic origin.
Preston (1954) suggests that the origin of the migmatite is probably a mix of both
super- and supra-crustal rocks. The paleosome consists of biotite, hornblende,
plagioclase (oligoclase to andesine) and quartz while the neosome consists of mainly
quartz and plagioclase. Alkali feldspar (microcline), if present, exists mostly as an
accessory mineral in the migmatite gneisses close to the Siilinjärvi carbonatite
complex. Grains of blueish quartz are in abundance in the migmatitic gneisses
directly west of the northern Siilinjärvi alkali complex. Only minor mica gneiss
bands are reported in the migmatites surrounding the study area (Lukkarinen, 2008).
The granitoids are distinguishable from the migmatite gneisses because of their
significantly more homogeneous appearance. The granitoids are mostly banded
ortogneisses but the banding differs in intensity. Several gneissic granitoids have
been identified in the vicinity of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. The gneissic
granitoids are made up of plagioclase (oligoclase), quartz, biotite and hornblende
with K-feldspar as either accessory or main mineral. The granitoids occur together
with the migmatite gneisses and are cut by the Paleoproterozoic metadiabase dykes
of the area. This, together with age determinations made on a similar tonalitic
granitoid in the Maaninka area (10 km west of Siilinjärvi), suggests that these
granitoids are of Archean age (Lukkarinen, 2008).

2.2 Carbonatite-glimmerite
The ore rock carbonatite-glimmerite makes up 26% of the entire Siilinjärvi alkali
complex. The carbonatite-glimmerite rock series has been divided into four different
rock types based on the amount of carbonates in the rock. The majority of the ore
body consists of glimmerite and carbonate glimmerite which are composed of up to
10% carbonates and 10-20% carbonates, respectively. With a carbonate amount of
20-50% the rock type is called silicosövite. A modal composition of over 50%
carbonate minerals is called sövite (carbonatite). The composition of this intrusive
rock can vary locally. This is due to the irregular structural relation between the
glimmerite and carbonatite endmembers. The striking contrast between the dark
coloured glimmerite and light sövite gives the deposit a striped appearance. It is
suggested that the carbonatite intruded as veins into the already emplaced glimmerite
(Heilimo et al., 2014).
The main minerals in the carbonatite-glimmerite rock series are tetraferriphlogopite,
phlogopite, calcite, apatite and amphibole (mostly richterite). As accessory minerals
there are mainly dolomite, zircon, magnetite and sulphides. The ore mineral apatite is
mined at two open pit mines Särkijärvi and Saarinen (Appendix A). The apatite is
quite evenly distributed in the ore body despite the sometimes chaotic appearance of
the intrusion. The apatite concentration can be high in carbonatites. If the amount of
apatite is over 25%, the rock is classified as an apatite rock. In these rocks the apatite
grains can be tens of centimetres wide. A total of 10% of the ore body consists of
apatite alone (O’Brien et al., 2015).

2.3 Metadiabase dykes and the quartz diorite intrusion
The youngest rocks in the Siilinjärvi complex are the Paleoproterozoic metadiabases
and the quartz diorite. The metadiabase dykes strike NW-SE through the intrusion
and the basement rocks. The dykes are metamorphosed and are therefore called
metadiabases. They range from a width of a couple of centimetres to tens of metres.
The contact zones to the Archean rocks are sheared and brittle. Their contact zones
and relation to each other suggest that there are more than one generation of mafic
dykes. This is supported by their different compositions. The main minerals include

4

amphibole, plagioclase and chlorite with accessory epidote, quartz and calcite
(Mattsson et al., 2019).
The quartz diorite intrusion is on the western side of the complex. Apophyses of the
tonalite are in contact with the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion. The quartz diorite
consists of quartz, andesitic plagioclase, hornblende and biotite (Lukkarinen, 2008).

3 Fenite overview

Fenite is a metasomatic rock, which is formed by alkaline to peralkaline fluids that
are associated with alkaline and or carbonatitic intrusions. The metasomatic process
is called fenitisation and affects the country rock. During fenitisation the fenitising
fluids raises the alkaline content of the country rock while also causing desilication.
The metasomatic fluid is released in multiple phases from the intrusion. Therefore,
the process of fenitisation is polymetasomatic. The fenitising fluids may also have
different sources as the intrusive source for the fluids are usually both alkaline and
carbonatitic. The alkaline source is often described to be from the melteigite-ijolite
alkali rock series (Morogan, 1994).
The fenitising fluid emanating from the intrusion is composed of different elements
and volatiles. The elements associated with fenitic fluids are K2O, Na2O, CaO FeO,
MgO, H2O and - crucially around carbonatites - CO2. The ratio between these fluids
along with their temperature and pressure is mostly what controls the fenitisation
(Elliot et al., 2018). Amphiboles and pyroxenes are susceptible to small variations in
the fenitising fluid and therefore their composition can vary (Hogarth & Lapointe,
1984). Two types of fluids affected the basement gneiss in Siilinjärvi. The first type
was of low alkali content but high H2O and CO2 content. The second type has high
alkali content and low CO2 content and evolved from the first fluid type during the
emplacement of the carbonatite (Poutiainen, 1995).

3.1 Fenite mineralogy
The mineralogy varies in fenites because of the infinite combinations of country rock
and fenitising fluid compositions coupled with different temperature gradients. A
unifying factor to all fenites, though, is the increase of alkalis and alkaline minerals
and the removal of quartz within the metasomatically altered rock. The minerals are
usually microcline, orthoclase, alkali amphiboles and alkali pyroxenes. Plagioclase
with high albite content and perthite is also commonly found in fenites.

6

The mineralogy is dictated by the protolith only in low to medium-grade fenites. In
the most extreme cases of fenitisation the protolith can become a feldspar-rock where
it is entirely made up of K-feldspar (Le Bas, 2008).

3.2 Fenite in Siilinjärvi
Surrounding almost the entire carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion is a fenite halo. The
fenite is red to pale white in colour and can be found in the carbonatite-glimmerite
ore body and even up to 4 km outside of the ore body where the fenite gradually
dissipates and turns into the surrounding basement gneiss. The fenite xenoliths
within the intrusion can be multiple metres in diameter and are usually surrounded by
a mantle of glimmerite. The fenite in Siilinjärvi consists of microcline, alkali
amphibole and alkali pyroxene along with accessory minerals such as carbonates,
apatite, magnetite, zircon and titanite (O’Brien et al., 2015).
The Siilinjärvi fenite was first discovered in 1864 by A.F. Thoreld. He described it as
a syenite which in places included calcite. In 1938, a geological map of the
Siilinjärvi area was produced by W.W. Wilkman. Here the outlines of the fenite
(then syenite) were much more precise and almost the entire extent of the fenite was
mapped. No carbonatite or glimmerite was observed at that time. The discovery of
the ore intrusion was made in 1950 after which the studies made in the area
multiplied (Puustinen, 2018).
Puustinen (1971) made the first comprehensive study of the complex. At this time,
fenite and fenitisation was known to take place around alkalic and carbonatitic
intrusions. Despite this Puustinen (1971) describes most of the wall rock as syenite
and theorises that a fenite halo of a couple of metres thin may exist around the
intrusion. The syenite was categorised to different types based on the dominant
minerals found in each type e.g. quartz-aegirine syenite, carbonate syenite and
amphibole syenite. This categorisation is still in use today. The only fenite features
explained are the ones that are noticeable in areas with the basement gneiss and
syenite (Puustinen, 1971).

7

3.3 Terminology of the Siilinjärvi fenite
The turning point in the nomenclature from syenite to fenite was made by Härmälä
(1981). He argued that the previously presumed syenite was actually fenite which he
called “syenitic fenite”. The fenite described by Puustinen was named “gneissic
fenite” since it displayed gneissic textures and was in the vicinity of the basement
gneiss. From here on, the term syenitic fenite or fenitic syenite was used for the
enigmatic alkalic rock type in the Siilinjärvi alkali complex and the immediate area.
At this time, many metasomatically altered gneisses around the northern parts of the
Siilinjärvi alkali complex have been described to be similar to the syenitic fenites
found in the complex (Paavola, 1984; 1988).
Lukkarinen (2008) also adopted the term syenitic fenite because of the plutonic
appearance of the alkali rock. The term was also used since there was insufficient
evidence for the genesis of the syenitic fenite. Lukkarinen (2008) theorised that the
syenite was emplaced before the carbonatite-glimmerite rocks. The fenitising fluids,
which emanated from the carbonatite-glimmerite, then fenitised the already
emplaced syenite.
The latest terminology in use for the pale gray to red alkali rock is fenite (O’Brien et
al., 2015). The lack of a distinct sharp contact between the basement gneiss and the
alkali rock minimises the possibility of the alkali rock being of plutonic origin. Fluid
inclusions in zircon and apatite within the carbonatite-glimmerite have compositions
that are fenitic in character (Poutiainen, 1995). These fluids are thought to have
produced the fenite halo during the ascent of the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion
(O’Brien et al., 2015).

3.4 Fenitisation stages of a granitoid protolith
Multiple reactions take place within the fenitisation process resulting in many
different and sometimes complex mineral parageneses and alteration textures. The
migmatitic basement gneiss surrounds the entire northern part of the Siilinjärvi
complex and is therefore assumed to be the only fenitised rock type. The relatively
homogeneous mineralogy of quartz, plagioclase, biotite and K-feldspar has been
fenitised through multiple stages of alkali metasomatism related to the
8

carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion. These stages have been recorded at other localities
where fenitisation has affected a granitoid protolith (e.g. Viladkar, 1986; Kresten &
Morogan, 1986; Le Bas, 2008).
The first stage of fenitisation of a granitoid is the turbidisation of the alkaline
feldspars, primarily the plagioclase. Undulatory extinction and granulation of the
quartz is also evident before it is consumed by other mineral phases in the later
stages of fenitisation. Biotite breaks down rapidly and is replaced by microline
and/or orthoclase and Fe-oxides. Along the veinlets, of which the fenitising fluids are
transported, pyroxene and amphibole (e.g. richterite or arfvedsonite) start to form
(Vartiainen & Woolley, 1976; Viladkar, 1986).
Further fenitisation causes the breakdown of quartz which leads to rapid growth and
formation of green pyroxene and/or blue amphibole between quartz and alkaline
feldspar grain boundaries. Blue amphibole also pseudomorphs biotite, which results
in biotite being consumed. Albitised margins form around primary K-feldspars and
the plagioclase can be completely indistinguishable due to the turbidisation.
The development of alkali pyroxene, usually aegirine, continues and quartz is
completely consumed. The albitised corona texture around K-feldspars increases and
perthite and chessboard albite can form. The K-feldspars formed by the breakdown
of biotite can also inherit the corona texture. Perthite usually replaces the primary
alkaline feldspar during high-grade fenitisation. Veins of carbonate can be abundant
at this stage but can also be absent. New corona textures can form around the mafic
minerals where amphibole replaces pyroxene or vice versa (Vartiainen & Woolley,
1976).
The final stage of fenitisation is where no primary minerals are present and the
replacement textures are replaced by recrystallisation textures. After the
aforementioned stages, the primary alkaline feldspar has either been replaced by
K-feldspar, perthite or albite (Le Bas, 2008). The main mafic minerals are pyroxene
or amphibole. At this stage the Na/K ratio of the fenitising fluid can be assumed (see
Table 1). In a sodic fenite Na-amphibole and albitic feldspar are dominant but in a
potassic fenite the mineral assemblage is mostly K-feldspar (up to 90%), pyroxene
and phlogopite. The accessory minerals that have formed at this stage are titanite,
apatite and secondary biotite (e.g. Morogan & Woolley, 1988).
9

A further higher-grade fenite can be present in the contact to the carbonatite or alkali
intrusion. It is the highest grade of fenitisation and occurs only in extreme cases
where minerals such as nepheline, cancrinite (Ca2Na6Al6O6(CO3)2

.

2H2O),

wollastonite, melanite (Ca3Fe3+2(SiO4)3) and phlogopite can be abundant (Sindern &
Kramm, 2000; Skelton et al., 2007).

granitoid protolith and ending in high-grade fenite

3.5 Categorisation of fenites
There are countless of different fenite types (Heinrich, 1985). Therefore, it is
important to classify them under one method of nomenclature. Multiple authors have
proposed many ways to categorise different varieties of fenites. The seemingly
simplest way to classify fenites is the source of the metasomatic fluid. It is difficult
to distinguish between a carbonatitic and alkaline (ijolitic) magmatic source for
fenitisation, since these two usually occur together in the same complex as in Fen,
Norway (Kresten, 1988). In the onset of fenite research the nomenclature was joined

10

with the terminology of plutonic rocks. This is because of the fenites’ similar
composition to syenite.
Another type of frequently used classification for fenites is to separate them into
sodic and potassic fenites, with an intermediate type between them. This is done by
calculating the ratio of K and Na, which is one of the most important parameters of
defining fenites (Elliot et al., 2018). That is why this type of categorisation is widely
used. Potassium-dominant fenitisation is characterised by an abundance of
K-feldspar along with some phlogopite, pyroxenes and Fe-oxides. Sodium
fenitisation leads to a more complex fenite composed of alkaline feldspar, albite,
Na-amphibole and Na-pyroxene.
Finally, the third way to categorise fenites is by their physical relation to the source
intrusion, i.e. aureole fenites, contact fenites and vein fenites (Kresten, 1988). This
type of categorisation is usually combined with a nomenclature which reflects the
grade or intensity of fenitisation (Fig. 2). This classification method is most
effectively done by Morogan (1994) who subcategorises the aureole fenites into low-,
medium- and high-grade fenites. Fenitisation intensity is the most descriptive way to
categorise fenites since it takes into consideration the mineralogy, texture and
structure.

11

Figure 2. Categorisation of fenites into contact fenites (A) aureole fenites (B1-3)
separated into high-grade (B3) medium-grade (B2) and low-grade fenites (B1). Vein
fenites (C) are separated into vein fenites within the aureole (C2), that can cause
superimposed fenitisation of the pre-existing fenites, and vein fenite outside of the
aureole (C1) (Kresten, 1988). In Siilinjärvi the source rock is carbonatite-glimmerite
and the wall rock is migmatitic basement gneiss.

3.5.1 Fenitisation grade
The adopted nomenclature used in this thesis is the one used by Morogan (1994).
That is because of its flexibility and versatility to be used in any fenite regardless of
the mineralogy of the fenite or the protolith.
By definition the low-grade fenites are dominated by textures present in the protolith
but with a more fenitic mineralogy. Most of the primary minerals are slightly altered
by the fenitisation but some minerals such as quartz can remain unaltered. Low-grade
alteration to fenite can be detected both macro- and microscopically. In
medium-grade fenites the fenite mineralogy dominates, i.e. fenites enriched in alkalis
and depleted in silica. Some relict textures and primary minerals are present. In
high-grade fenites all primary textures and minerals of the protolith are absent. The
rock is completely alkali metasomatised and all minerals have recrystallised to fenite

12

minerals. High-grade fenites may be misconstrued to be syenites because of their
highly igneous appearance (Morogan, 1994).
In areas with low- to medium-grade fenitisation it is essential to understand the
protolith for the fenite. Relict minerals and textures belonging to the protolith, in
Siilinjärvi the migmatitic basement gneiss, may be misconstrued as products of the
alkali metasomatism. This will lead to inaccurate analysis of the fenitisation process,
and not least to inaccurate interpretations of the fenitisation grade. The analysis of
the fenites rests partially on the assumption that the metasomatically affected
basement gneiss was homogeneous. This is because of the difficulty to accurately
trace back to the exact mineralogy of the protolith, since many parameters other than
the protolith’s mineralogy affect the characteristics of a fenite (Elliot et al., 2018).
Beyond the fenite aureole in Siilinjärvi, the migmatitic basement gneiss can indeed
be called homogeneous with a few notable exceptions such as wide hornblende and
mica schist areas (Puustinen, 2008).

4 Material and methodology

4.1 Field mapping and sampling
Mapping and sample collecting was conducted during the summer months of 2018 in
an area that covered approximately 8 km2. The main focus was on the fenite
lithology and its contact relations to the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion and
basement gneiss in the northern area of the Siilinjärvi alkaline complex.
Mapping areas were planned beforehand with the help of bedrock maps and
additional mapping information provided by Yara Suomi Oy. To further plan the
mapping, digital elevation maps (DEM) with hill shade were created on the
open-source geographical information system QGIS (Appendix B). The elevation
data was acquired from the open-source provider National Land Survey of Finland
(NLS). This was combined with outcrop data gathered during 1978-1980 by the
Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) to aid finding areas with outcrops.

13

Across the entire northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex a total of 244 outcrop
observations were made (Fig. 3). Observation data gathered at outcrops was recorded
in the Kapalo mobile application developed by GTK. The geological observations
are recorded in the WGS84 coordinate system. Every observation has a unique
observation ID created by the Kapalo application. Outcrop photographs were linked
to the IDs, as well as tectonic measurements. A previous bedrock map combined
with the DEM map was created on QGIS and transferred over as a GeoTIFF file to
the Kapalo application. The Kapalo observation database was then imported to QGIS
where it was further processed to create a comprehensive point file.
Within the fenite lithology, the outcrops at high elevations were often observed to be
fenite or diabase. On low elevations the outcrops were usually fenite or glimmerite
on the western branch and only fenite on the eastern branch. This was applied later
during field mapping when the DEM could be used more effectively in light of this
information.

observation.

4.2 Micro-XRF
Micro X-Ray Fluorescence (µXRF) is used to detect quantities of different chemical
elements and generate a colour map which indicates where the analysed element is.
In this study the µXRF used was an M4 TORNADO and the Brauer software. The
µXRF is a useful method for analysing larger areas of a sample. Samples that are
chosen for µXRF analysis display a complex mineral assemblage or have minerals
which are observed in petrographical microscope to be altered. The fenitising fluids,
which alter the minerals, are identifiable by analysing a mineral that exhibits zoning
15

or more complex alteration. Therefore, a map that displays the distribution of an
element which is mobile and abundant in the fenitisation process, is an effective way
to analyse a fenite of any fenitisation grade. Both major and trace element analysis
can be conducted on µXRF. In fenites the most important elements to analyse are K,
Na, Si, Ba and Sr. These are the most mobile elements and are parameters that can
indicate different grades of fenitisation (Elliot et al., 2018; references therein).

4.3 Thin sections
Thin sections of 17 samples were prepared by the author at the thin section
preparation facilities shared by Åbo Akademi University and Turun Yliopisto. The
thin sections are prepared from 15 fenite samples and one glimmerite and one gneiss
sample. Thin sections were prepared from samples which represented different areas
of the fenite and had differing appearances on the outcrops. Clear textural differences
between fenites on outcrop scale was also an important factor in selecting the correct
samples for thin section preparation.
The polished thin sections are 30 µm thick and are glued on a glass slide varying
between 1508-1544 µm in thickness. The glue used is a 1:4 ratio epoxy blend of
hardener and epoxy glue. The polished thin sections are used to distinguish different
mineral facies and micro-textures. Primarily they are used to find indicator minerals
that can be connected to different grades of fenitisation.

5 Results

5.1 Field mapping
Out of the 244 observed outcrops 126 are fenite, 60 are gneiss, 44 are metadiabase,
14 are glimmerite and five are chlorite schist (Appendix C). Four outcrops contain
two or more of the aforementioned rock types. The lithological map provided by
Yara Suomi Oy correlated well with the observations made in the field.

16

5.1.1 Main fenite type
The main fenite type is instantly recognisable in the field compared to the basement
gneiss. It is red, pale red to dark green in colour with an unaltered igneous texture. It
contains red alkaline feldspar, dark green pyroxene and at times magnetite,
amphibole and quartz. This mineralogy is common throughout the fenite lithology in
the study area. Both the quartz and the magnetite appear sporadically either as an
accessory mineral in the matrix or as veins. Calcite can also be present in the fenite
but only in trace amounts. Textures vary dramatically from igneous unaltered
appearance to banded appearance. The grain sizes vary from small to pegmatitic and
the mineral composition of an outcrop can vary from 90% alkaline feldspar to 90%
pyroxene and everything in between. Usually the coarse-grained to pegmatitic parts
are composed of sub- to euhedral pyroxenes and quartz or pyroxene and alkaline
feldspar (Fig. 4a). Rarely do all three minerals occur together in a pegmatitic fenite.
If alkaline feldspar is present, it can be perthitic and/or exhibit a mantle texture with
a different coloured rim respective to the core of the mineral (Fig. 4b).
The pyroxene is observed to behave plastically in the fenite in contrast to the alkaline
feldspar which appears unaltered. The pyroxenes form coarse-grained aggregates
which are at places plastically folded in an otherwise igneous-looking rock with an
alkaline feldspar ground mass (Fig. 4c). Pyroxene and alkaline feldspar can form
dyke-like aggregates seemingly crosscutting the existing fenite. This occurs almost
exclusively on the eastern branch. The dykes are usually over ten centimetres wide
and can be followed through an outcrop up to tens of metres. The minerals are no
smaller than coarse-grained with the pyroxenes oriented perpendicularly to the
direction of the dyke. Along the edges of the dykes the perpendicular pyroxene
growth is increased. This is distinguishable especially in the feldspar-rich dykes (Fig.
4e).
Magnetite can behave in a similar way forming coarse-grained aggregates (Fig. 4d).
These are uncommon and have most notably been found in areas with cracks and
veins filled with abundant magnetite and quartz-magnetite. Amphibole-filled cracks
occur scarcely and have been subjected to shearing since the amphibole crystals are
elongated and close to fibrous. These cracks are no more than a centimetre thick.

5.1.2 Fenite gneiss
The contact areas between the fenite and the gneiss are gradual. The fenitisation
grade in these areas is generally low and unfenitised basement gneiss can be present
very close to fenite gneiss. The gneissic fenite is characterised by the abundant
amount of quartz and lack of pyroxenes. Bands of biotite and other gneissic textures
quickly disappear at the faint but wide transition zone between the gneiss and the
fenite. Despite this, gneissic banding with fenitic composition is observed at multiple
locations (Fig. 5a). Veins consisting of alkaline feldspar, pyroxene and quartz are
also common on the outskirts of the fenite but not limited to this area. These veins
are usually coarse-grained and at times pegmatitic (Fig. 5b). Magnetite grains are
uncommon and occur on the eastern edge of the northern alkaline complex. These
characteristics of a fenite gneiss can be present on a single outcrop as demonstrated
on outcrop SIKA-2018-41 (Fig. 5c). Outside of the fenite aureole, the basement
gneiss is unaltered with the exception of a few veins with a fenitic composition,
epidote or magnetite filled cracks and blue opalescent quartz.

coarse-grained alkaline feldspar and pyroxene with minor magnetite and can be
construed as a fenitic dyke. The gneissic parts both above and under the fenite are
mineralogically similar to the surrounding gneiss but with minimal amounts of
biotite.

5.1.3 Fenite near the intrusion
The fenite close to the intrusion (up to 100 metres) exhibits an igneous texture on the
western branch. Grain sizes vary from medium to pegmatitic. The fenite is usually
pale white or pale red in colour and is dominated by feldspars. The feldspars can
exhibit a rimmed mantle-like texture with a brown rim and a creamy white core or
vice versa (Fig. 6). Perthitic texture is also observed within these mantle-textured
feldspars. Curiously, quartz can be found in locations no more than 50 metres from
the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion. The quartz is translucent and can vary from
milky to blue in colour. Blue quartz is often in contact with a dark blue mafic mineral.
The dark mafic mineral cannot be determined in the field. It is considered to be an
amphibole since, in places, it can be close to fibrous. At these locations the texture is
banded and lineation can be observed (Fig. 7a, 7b).

from the intrusion. b) Elongated milky quartz (blue in places), feldspar and blue
amphibole. SIKA-2018-195 outcrop is a mere metres from the intrusion.

The percentage of carbonate minerals in the fenite increases near the contact to the
intrusion. The carbonates are deeply weathered and can only be detected by the
chemical reaction between hydrochloric acid and carbonate. Within a few metres up
to tens of metres from the intrusion the fenite is deeply weathered to the point were
no sample can be gathered since the fenite breaks down to small pebbles and grains
of feldspar (Fig. 8). At these places the soil can include laths of a dark mica.

22

Figure 8. Grains of feldspar from the fenite stuck on the soil at SIKA-2018-216
which is roughly 50 metres from the intrusion. Carbonates are also present at this and
the surrounding outcrops.

In an area on the eastern fenite branch there are outcrops of fenite that display similar
characteristics as the fenites proven to be within 100 meters from the carbonatite
glimmerite intrusion. These fenites have feldspar with mantle texture and are rich in
carbonates. Nearest outcrops of the carbonatite glimmerite intrusion to these fenites
are two kilometres away.

5.1.4 Glimmerite
To find possible outcrops of carbonatite-glimmerite the technique of geobotanics was
used because of the luxuriant and fern-rich vegetation that was found at every
carbonatite-glimmerite outcrop (Fig. 9a). At these locations small streams and

23

ditches filled with mica are common and the soil as well as the bedrock contain loose
laths of mica in abundance (Fig. 9b).
Rocks belonging to the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusive body are only found on the
western branch of the northern Siilinjärvi alkaline complex. Glimmerite is the only
rock type belonging to the intrusion observed during field mapping. The glimmerite
is dark to light brown sometimes with a red hue and consists a minimum of 80% of
phlogopite. Along with the phlogopite there is blue amphibole, magnetite, apatite and
carbonates. The three latter minerals are not found on all the outcrops (Fig. 10). The
blue amphibole has been recognised previously in the mine to be richterite
(Na2Ca(Mg,Fe)5Si8O22(OH)2). However, the alkali composition of the blue
amphiboles varies to such an extent that it may include different amphibole variants
(O´Brien, 2015). The amphibole and magnetite-rich glimmerites are more
coarse-grained and more resistant than the amphibole-poor glimmerites. They are
therefore found at higher elevations and form steep ridges and cliffs similar to the
metadiabase dykes in the area. Some glimmerites also contain sulfide minerals.

outcrops they occur.

5.1.5 Gneiss
The basement gneiss is characterised by gneissic banding with alternating felsic and
mafic parts consisting of light coloured feldspar and quartz, and biotite and
hornblende respectively (Fig. 11a). Quartz veins, granitic dykes and epidote filled
cracks are common. At places the cracks are filled with magnetite. Migmatitic gneiss,
which is the dominant rock type in the basement gneiss complex (Lukkarinen, 2008),
was not observed during the mapping. West of the western branch the gneiss is more
metasomatically altered. Epidotisation has affected large parts of the gneiss turning it
pale green. Blue opalescent quartz is also observed (Fig. 11b).
Between the two branches belonging to the alkali complex is an unmetasomatised
basement gneiss which belongs to the same suite as the surrounding gneisses. The
gneiss between the two fenite branches is characterised by a network of quartz
veinlets. A distinct shear zone is the main structure in this area and it can be tracked
for hundreds of metres.

the western gneiss at SIKA-2018-113.

5.1.6 Metadiabase
The diabase dykes in the Siilinjärvi area are metamorphosed and are therefore named
metadiabase. The dykes are dark green to dark brown in colour and consist mostly of
plagioclase and hornblende. The orientation of the dykes varies between NW-SE to
NNW-SSE and can sometimes be followed for hundreds of metres since the dykes
form ridges in the terrain. The grain size varies from fine to medium and the texture
is usually slightly lineated but can exhibit ophitic textures. Contact relations between
the metadiabase dykes and the main lithologies are sharp. At places the contact is
deeply sheared creating a tens of centimetres wide shear zone consisting of chlorite
schist. Epidote veinlets and cracks are observed in the metadiabase dyke west of the
alkaline complex (Fig. 12a). These are in places cut by later fractures. Enigmatic
feldspar xenocrysts are observed in a clearly oriented metadiabase dyke in the
eastern fenite branch (Fig. 12b).

5.1.7 Tectonic structures
Tectonic measurements can only be made in the gneiss, the fenite gneiss and rough
contact areas formed by the cross-cutting metadiabases. A large shear zone is located
in the gneiss between the two fenite branches. It is characterized by strong schistosity
and unique mineralogy. Talc and chlorite layers are formed in the gneiss along with
feldspar and quartz layers (Fig. 13). The schistosity has a N-S direction with a
median dip/dip direction of 70/270. This direction and dip is similar in the gneissic
banding and foliation across the entire northern alkali complex with minor local
variations. Lineation or foliation was observed at a few glimmerite outcrops. They
have a shallow dip of 40o to the north east instead of a steep dip towards west as in
the other lithologies.

5.2 Micro-XRF analysis
Micro-XRF analysis was conducted of eleven samples. Seven thin sections were
prepared out of the eleven samples in an effort to combine µXRF results with
petrographic microscopy results. The samples chosen for analysis are from different
key areas in the mapped fenite lithology. They were chosen not only on a
geographical basis but also based on their wide-ranging appearance and field
relations to the carbonatite-glimmerite (Fig. 14). Pale white fenites and red fenites
were analysed, as were the fenites with macroscopic mantle texture and blue
opalescent quartz. Along with the fenite samples one glimmerite sample was also
analysed.

28

Figure 14. Lithological map of the northern Siilinjärvi alkali complex with thin
section and µXRF sample points. The underlined sample IDs signify µXRF analysed
samples.

The main goal of the µXRF analysis was to determine the type of fenitisation along
with the distribution of mobile elements typical to the process of fenitisation. The
analysis of the main components of fenitisation, i.e. Na and K, show that Na can only
be found in trace amounts while K is the dominant element in the alkaline feldspars
and one of the most abundant elements in every fenite sample analysed. In figure 15
the quantity of K and Na is visualised in the µXRF analysis. The grainy and washed
out visualisation of Na is because of the low Na amounts in the samples as well as
the element’s physical properties, e.g. atomic mass. In contrast, the visualisation of K
is clear and sharp. This signifies high quantities of the element. Grain boundaries are
29

also distinct in the analysis which is consistent with the distribution and grain sizes
of the alkaline feldspars in the samples.

Figure 15. On the left is a µXRF analysis “map” of the distribution and relative
quantity of K (orange). And on the right a µXRF analysis map showing the
distribution of Na (green) within the same samples. Notice the scattering of Na on
the lower right corner where there’s no sample.

5.2.1 Mafic minerals
The green mafic minerals analysed with the µXRF software are clinopyroxenes
belonging to the aegirine-augite series. This is confirmed by the petrographic
analysis. The dominating mafic minerals contain varying amounts of Fe, Mg and Ca
(Fig. 16). Sodium is also present in most of the analysed mafic minerals but not in
significant amounts. The complex composition of aegirine-augite means a wide
variety of small compositional variations and element substitution within an
aegirine-augite grain is expected. In samples SIKA-2018-53.1 and SIKA-2018-177.1
there are significant Mg anomalies within the mafic minerals. The anomaly shows an
uneven distribution of Mg in the mafic minerals, suggesting that portions of the
aegirine-augite are enriched in the augite component (Fig. 16). The high amount of
Ca and low amount of Na in the element analysis supports the notion that the
clinopyroxene is augite dominated. Elevated amounts of Na is evident in only one
sample (SIKA-2018-191.1). Here the amount of Ca is significantly lower than in the

30

other samples, implicating a sodium-rich amphibole to be the dominant mafic
mineral.

Figure 16. Mg, Fe and Ca displayed on µXRF maps of SIKA-2018-23.1. All the
minerals giving off a signal are clinopyroxenes, except for the bright blue Ca
anomalies, which are carbonates. The grainy Mg signatures are due to the light
atomic mass of Mg and limitations of the µXRF method to accurately estimate the
content and placement of lighter elements.

5.2.2 Element distribution in feldspars
Macroscopic mantle texture in alkaline feldspars, which is visible in samples
SIKA-2018-144.1, SIKA-2018-144.1.2 and SIKA-2018-177.1, are characterised by a
dark gray to brown-coloured core and a pale white rim. This texture is also visible in
the µXRF when Ti (titanium) and Sr (strontium) are displayed with the
µXRFsoftware (Fig. 17). The µXRF map shows the alkaline feldspar rims depleted
of these elements or, in contrast, a core enriched in Ti, Sr and Ba (barium). The
amount of these elements is small but geochemical analysis shows an up to ten-fold
depletion of Ti from core to rim (Fig. 18). Other than this anomaly, these samples
exhibit very even distribution of potassium in the feldspars with insignificant
amounts of sodium and calcium. A µXRF map of SIKA-2018-177.1 with Ba is
included in Appendix D.

31

Figure 17. A photo and a µXRF map displaying the distribution of K, Ti and Sr in
SIKA-2018-144.1. The area with different shades of yellow are grains of alkaline
feldspar with an even distribution of K. The dark yellow anomalies represent Sr and
Ti enriched alkaline feldspar, which is evident in the spectrum analysed alkaline
feldspar grains within the green box (Fig. 18). The red anomalies outside of the
alkaline feldspars are calcites which contain strontium.

32

Point 0

Figure 18. The spectrum line analysis results of two alkaline feldspars from
SIKA-2018-144.1 show a sharp decrease of TiO2, Sr and Ba around point 150 and an
increase at point 190. This area of decreased TiO2, Sr and Ba content is the rim and
contact area of two alkaline feldspars. The spectrum line is ca. 2.2 cm long.

The potassium distribution map generated shows distinct abrupt feldspar grain edges
on samples SIKA-2018-20.1, -23.1, -47.1, -53.1, -233.1 and a less noticeable but a
similar pattern on samples SIKA-2018-48.1 and SIKA-2018-191.1. The feldspar
grains appear to be separated by a network of veinlets between the grains. The
distribution of aluminium and silica stays the same but there is a significant loss of
potassium and an increase of Na content around the rims of the feldspars (Fig. 19).
33

Because of an even distribution of Al and Si, it is assumed that feldspar with high
albite content is rimming the potassic feldspar (microcline or orthoclase).
Albite-rimmed microcline has been observed in some potassic fenites around the
world (Le Bas, 2008). This implies a late sodium enrichment in the fenitising fluid
which has affected only the rims of the potassic feldspars and caused albitisation (Fig.
20).

spectrum line analysis profiles (‘Profil’ 1-4) conducted across alkaline feldspar

Figure 20. Spectrum line analysis results of the albite-rimmed alkaline feldspars from

where albite is present. This is displayed by the increase in Na-content as illustrated
in Profil 1. The three other spectrum line graphs share the same pattern with Profil 1.

In sample SIKA-2018-191.1 the alkaline feldspars have undergone exsolution. It is
the only micro-XRF analysed sample where extensive perthitisation can be
visualised in a µXRF map. The exsolution lamellae can be visualised in a line chart
where the albite content (Na) increases when the K content decreases (Fig. 21). The
perthites in the same sample also display a corona texture, with Ti and Sr enriched
cores, as in sample SIKA-2018-144.1 (Fig. 17).

SIKA-2018-191.1. Point 0 is at the red dot on the µXRF map where orange is K and
teal is Na. The spectrum line is ca. 0.9 cm long.

5.3 Thin section analysis
Petrographic and mineralogical analysis of the samples were done by analysing them
under a petrographic microscope. Fifteen thin sections representing different fenites
were prepared together with one gneiss and one glimmerite thin section sample. The
main minerals in the fifteen fenite thin sections are alkaline feldspar and
clinopyroxene. In individual fenite thin sections the main minerals can include
amphibole, quartz and calcite. Common accessory minerals are apatite, calcite,
plagioclase, titanite and opaques.

5.3.1 Clinopyroxene
The clinopyroxene is determined to be aegirine-augite because of its dark green to
pale green pleochroism. This observation is supported by previous studies made of
the Siilinjärvi fenites (Puustinen, 1971 & Härmälä, 1981). It exists in all but three
thin sections and is an accessory mineral in only one thin section. The aegirine-augite
occurs mostly as mineral aggregates and clusters (Fig. 22). Some of the grains are
altered resulting in a blue amphibole corona around a single grain or the entire
37

augirine-augite cluster. The process of a pyroxene alteration resulting in an
amphibole is called uralitisation. Opaques, titanite and apatite inclusions can occur in
the pyroxene.

Figure 22. An aegirine-augite aggregate in sample SIKA-2018-224.1 in both PPL
(plane polarised light) and XPL (cross polarised light). The green minerals are
aegirine-augite and the pale minerals are alkaline feldspar. Width of the frame is 1.0
mm.

5.3.2 Alkaline feldspar
The alkaline feldspar is most notably microcline and orthoclase. It has formed as a
product of plagioclase and primary K-feldspar breakdown. Varying intensities of
microcline cross-hatching is observed. Orthoclase can be difficult to distinguish
because of the different alterations leading to a turbiditic characteristic of the mineral,
which is absent in primary K-feldspars. There are many structures and textures that
are imprinted on the alkaline feldspars, fracturing and chessboard twinning along
with textures related to pressure solution. Perthite is present in inconsistent amounts.
It can be highly distinguishable or barely visible (Fig. 23a). Perthite is consistently
present together with chessboard twinning, also known as chessboard albite (Fig.
23b).

39

Na-rimmed texture that is visible in the µXRF analysis maps is also observed in the
petrographic microscope. The rims of the alkaline feldspars, usually microcline, are
crowded by smaller grains of a more unturbidised feldspar i.e. an undisturbed
feldspar. It has a similar appearance to the uralitic texture formed by Na-amphiboles
found on multiple pyroxene grains. Some of the unturbidised feldspars display albite
twinning and can even form a complex chessboard albite texture (Fig. 24). Calcite
and quartz can also rim the alkaline feldspars.

The mantle-textured alkaline feldspars observed in the field do not display a similar
texture in thin section e.g. SIKA-2018-177.1. In thin section the feldspars display
cross-hatching (microcline) and perthitic textures. The feldspars have small
inclusions of high interference coloured minerals some of which are identified as
carbonates and micas. These inclusions are concentrated in the core of the feldspars

40

along with turbiditic microtextures. The rims of the feldspars are mostly devoid of
the inclusion (Fig. 25).

SIKA-2018-177.1. Width of the frame is 1.2 mm.

5.3.3 Amphibole
The amphibole in the fenites is mostly blue to dark blue but can also be blue-green
pleochroic. It can be found in almost all fenite thin sections but only as a main
mineral in fenites with minor or no aegirine-augite. The blue amphibole exists
together with the aegirine-augite and can form a corona-like texture around the
aegirine-augite grains due to uralitisation (Fig. 26). This aegirine-augite to blue
amphibole reaction is also evident along fractures within aegirine-augite grains. The
Na-rich fluids have travelled along these fractures and altered the pyroxenes in the
immediate vicinity into blue amphiboles. Na-amphibole replacing pyroxene could be
evidence of two separate fenitisation events (Verschure & Maijer, 2005). The blue
amphibole is presumed to be either richterite or riebeckite, since those amphiboles

41

are fairly common in the carbonatite glimmerite intrusion (Härmälä, 1981 & O’Brien,
2015). The amphibole also forms a pseudomorph of a mica.
Pure blue amphibole grains with no contact to pyroxene is found in four thin sections.
The most notable of these being in sample SIKA-2018-191.1. Here the blue
amphibole is rounded and has a cloudy core (Fig. 27). The characteristic 120o
cleavage in amphiboles is visible in samples SIKA-2018-47.1 and SIKA-2018-150.1.
The blue amphibole in these samples is subhedral and can occur together with the
pyroxene.

blue colour and intense pleochroism suggests that these amphiboles are riebeckites.
Width of the frame is 1.5 mm.

5.3.4 Accessory minerals
Quartz can be absent or a main mineral in the fenite thin sections. It displays
consistent textures such as undulation and dynamic recrystallisation throughout all
the thin sections quartz is present in. According to Bardina & Popov (1994) silica
does not need to be mobile during the course of fenitisation. If the protolith has a low
silica content the process of fenitisation may increase the amount of silica respective
to the protolith (Elliot et al., 2018).
Calcite exists in all but one thin section. It occurs as individual grains and aggregates.
Calcite together with quartz can also occur around the edges of other minerals and
sometimes surround them completely (Fig. 28). Calcite is considered as an
uncommon mineral in fenites (Zharikov, 2007). However, it is commonly found in
fenites formed by carbonatites. This is evident in the Fen (Norway) and Alnö

43

(Sweden) fenites, where fenitsation caused by melteigite-ijolite series rocks contain
only tiny amounts of calcite while carbonatite induced fenites contain larger amounts
of calcite (Morogan & Woolley, 1988; Morogan, 1994).

Titanite is present in minor to moderate amounts in five thin sections. The largest
amounts of titanite is found in thin section samples taken of fenites affected by the
SE-NW shearing typical to the area.
Dark mica is present in the basement gneiss thin section as expected and is
presumably biotite. In fenite sample SIKA-2018-47.1 the primary biotite is present.
Phlogopite is observed in sample SIKA-2018-220.1 it occurs together with blue
amphibole but not with the pyroxene.
Opaques are present in 11 out of 15 thin sections. The opaque minerals are assumed
to be magnetite and ilmenite, both of which were observed in the field. The opaques
are situated sparsely in most of the thin sections but in samples SIKA-2018-53.1,
44

208.1 and 215.1 the opaques occur together with either aegirine-augite or the blue
amphibole. Ilmenite is recognised by the TiO2 pseudomorph leucoxene (Fig. 29).

6 Discussion

Potassic fenitisation is the main type of fenitisation observed in the northern part of
the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. The majority of carbonatite complexes around the
world have a potassic fenite halo and as such the K-fenitisation is expected (Elliot et
al. 2018). However, most of the samples studied have displayed fenitisation where
both alkalis (K and Na) have been mobile. Even in extreme cases of K and Na fenites
respectively, there are evidence of both alkalis being active during the
metasomatisation of the wall rock (Le Bas, 2008).

The main feldspars observed in the samples and in the field are microcline,
orthoclase and perthite, which are the results of K-fenitisation in the northern part of
the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. The prevalent mafic minerals during pure
K-fenitisation are clinopyroxene and Fe-oxides (Le Bas, 2008). Both of these
minerals are observed in the field and in thin sections respectively.
Fenite xenoliths within the Siilinjärvi carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion could have
been formed by hydraulic fracturing caused by the potassic fenitic fluids before the
emplacement of the intrusion. Fenitic breccias along with fractures and cracks are
more common around potassic fenites than sodic fenites (Le Bas, 2008). The fenite
xenoliths in Siilinjärvi are mantled by phlogopite, which is of magmatic origin.
Phlogopitisation is characteristic for K-fenitisation. The H2O-rich fluids that caused
the fenitisation at Siilinjärvi are also connected to phlogopite growth evident between
carbonatite and country rock (Poutiainen, 1995; Le Bas, 2008). This could indicate
that some of the glimmerite in Siilinjärvi is formed due to alkali metasomatism.
Intriguingly, Le Bas (2008) suggests that the source for the K-rich fenitising fluids
could be a phlogopite-bearing mantle, from which the carbonatite magma has
derived. Fenite outcrops, closest to the glimmerite outcrops, also display a potassic
fenitisation since the fenite consists mostly of alkaline feldspar. In sample
SIKA-2018-220.1 phlogopite is present suggesting high-grade fenitisation or even
contact fenitisation.
Veinlets and cracks filled with carbonates are a sign of K-fenitisation. The CO2-rich
fluids cause brecciation and cracks through which the fenitising fluids propagate.
Carbonates therefore form within the microfractures, which are visible in e.g. sample
SIKA-2018-208.1. Widespread K-fenitisation is induced by CO2-rich fluids where K
is partitioned into alkaline feldspars (Rubie & Gunter, 1983). High CO2-content
fluids are present in fluid inclusions found in early formed zircons at Siilinjärvi
(Poutiainen, 1995).

46

6.2 Na-fenitisation
In many samples there is a depletion of K and an increase of Na content around the
potassic feldspars, forming a corona texture. In these samples albitisation has
affected the microcline and orthoclase. This has caused chessboard albite and small
albite grains to form on the rims of the K-feldspar. Similar albite-rimmed alkaline
feldspars have been observed in other potassic fenites in for example Silai Patti,
Pakistan and Ruri Hills, Kenya (Le Bas, 2008). In sodic fenites at Iivaara, Finland,
the secondary alkaline feldspar is rimmed by Na-rich feldspar. In high-grade fenites
at Iivara the corona texture remains during the Na-enrichment of the cores of the
alkaline feldspars (Sindern and Kramm, 2000). This further sodic-fenitisation does
not take place in Siilinjärvi.
A similar rimmed texture of the aegirine-augite is observed in multiple thin sections.
On the edges of the pyroxene the aegirine-augite has altered to a blue amphibole
causing a uralitic texture. The amphibole is presumed to be Na-rich since the uralitic
texture is also found in the most Na-rich sample SIKA-2018-191.1. Even though the
uralitic texture is also present in the same samples as the albitised alkaline feldspars
the mafic mineral does not display a similar sodium anomaly in the µXRF analyses
as to the feldspars. A pyroxene and amphibole occuring together is typical for a
sodium fenite (Elliot et al., 2018). This coeval existence of the two minerals could
reflect the development of the fenitising fluids, where the later phases replace the
first dominant fenitisation products (Hogarth & Lapointe, 1984). At Silai Patti,
Pakistan the K-fenite is cut by later carbonatite dykes which have caused sodic
fenitisation. In these fenites magnesio-arfvedsonite is found on the edges of
aegirine-augite aggregates. This is presumed to be a direct cause of the introduction
of the sodic fluids to the K-fenite (LeBas, 2008).

6.3 Categorisation of observed fenites into fenitisation grades

6.3.1 Low-grade fenite
Fenite gneiss is deemed low-grade in multiple fenite aureoles with Siilinjärvi being
no exception. Pyroxene and alkaline feldspar formation during desilication is the first
stage of fenitisation and visible furthest away from the carbonatite-glimmerite
intrusion and closest to the basement gneiss. Relict minerals and textures are
common in low-grade fenites at Siilinjärvi e.g. gneissic banding (where some relict
biotite is present) and quartz that is still visible in the matrix. Sample
SIKA-2018-53.1 from the eastern branch is a typical low-grade fenite. Patches of a
dark mineral assemblage (aegirine-augite) has formed together with alkaline feldspar
and quartz while the gneissic banding is starting to break down (I, III).
Alkali-metasomatic alteration has affected the edges of the primary minerals e.g.
albitisation around primary feldspar (II). The accessory minerals are unchanged from
the basement gneiss with carbonate, apatite and opaques present in the low-grade
fenites.

6.3.2 Medium-grade fenite
At this stage of fenitisation the gneissic minerals, quartz, plagiocalse and biotite, are
completely consumed by the alkali minerals (IV). The assemblage consists largely of
aegirine-augite and microcline/orthoclase. Perthite has started to form as well as
albitised rims on the secondary feldspars (V). Chessboard albite is also present in
some medium-grade fenites. Aegirine-augite is more developed and deuteric
alteration in the form of uralitisation is present, displaying a later sodic fenitisation
event where blue amphibole has formed around the rims of the pyroxene (Verschure
& Maijer, 2005). It is proposed that a large portion of the eastern fenite branch is of
medium-grade fenite e.g. sample SIKA-2018-2.1 and SIKA-2018-20.1. The fenite is
mostly red to pale red in colour and the mineralogy along with the microtextures
remain mostly unchanged through out. The main fenite type in the northern part of
the Siilinjärvi alkali complex is considered to be a medium-grade fenite.

6.3.3 High-grade fenite
The high-grade fenites are concentrated around the intrusion on the western fenite
branch. Replacement textures such as uralitisation and albitisation are more
pronounced than in lower fenite grades. In places blue amphibole has completely
replaced the aegirine-augite or formed witout the process of uralitisation (. New
mineral paragenesis have formed such as blue amphibole, quartz and perthite in the
center of the western fenite branch. A common form of high-grade fenite is a
mantle-textured alkaline feldspar rock with less mafic minerals, indicating a
K-dominant fenitic fluid. Increased amount of calcite that fills micro fractures,
formed within microcline and orthocalse grains is also concentrated in high-grade
fenites indicating a CO2-rich fenitising fluid which is to be expected around a
carbonatite intrusion (VIII).
The mantle-textured alkaline feldspar fenites are also considered high-grade fenites.
Not only do they occur in the vicinity of the intrusion in the western branch but
similar mantle textures are observed in perthites found in the amphibole-rich fenites
such as sample SIKA-2018-191.1 (Fig. 30). Fenites with the mantle-textured alkaline
feldspars are observed to be one of the main types of high-grade fenite.

approximately 1.0 cm.

6.3.4 Contact fenite
The contact fenite is difficult to define based on the samples analysed. In the field the
only confirmed contact fenite is observed to contain alkaline feldspar and carbonate,
further indicating a strong K-dominant fenitisation close to the intrusion. Sample
SIKA-2018-220.1 is assumed to be a contact fenite because of the phlogopite-rich
part of the outcrop which is also observed in the thin section (IX). Phlogopitisation is
widely reported from fenite aureoles with K-dominant fenitisation e.g. Sokli and Fen.
In these alkaline complexes phlogopite is observed in high-grade fenites and in direct
contact with carbonatite veins as a result of phlogopitisation of alkaline feldspars
(Vartianinen & Woolley, 1976; Kresten & Morogan, 1986).

6.4 Comparison between western and eastern fenite branches
The most notable part of the northern Siilinjärvi alkali comlex is the branching of the
fenite aureole. The principal difference between the branches is the lack of rocks
belonging to the carbonatite-glimmerite series in the eastern branch. The branches
are separated by an area of basement gneiss through which runs a shear zone.
The shear zone is debated to have a role in the branching of the fenite aureole. The
lack of carbonatite-glimmerite rocks in the eastern branch could be because of the
shear zone. The eastern branch fenite could originate from further south in the
complex, namely from the area next to the Saarinen open pit. Here the
carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion is in direct contact to the basement gneiss on the
eastern side with virtually no fenitisation that has taken place. The lack of
carbonatite-glimmerite series rocks in the eastern branch could also be explained by
a deeper emplacement of the intrusion. This would explain the absence of the ore
rock at the surface along with the general lower grade of fenitisation compared to the
western branch.
The western branch fenites are more heterogeneous to the eastern branch. The
high-grade fenitisation observed close to the intrusion varies from amphibole-rich to
almost pure alkali feldspar rock, both of which are absent in the eastern branch.
Quartz-rich fenite outcrops are also more scattered in the west and can be found in
the center of the western aureole. This can be due to the silification conditions
prevalent in the western branch (Kresten, 1988).
The fenite in the eastern branch is dominantly medium-grade along with a steady
decline of fenitisation grade to the outer edges of the branch. An area in the
northwest corner of the eastern branch is an exception. The fenite in this area is
carbonate rich and therefore moderately weathered, similar to some high-grade fenite
outcrops in the western branch. Outcrop SIKA-2018-221 also displays some variant
of a mantle textured feldspar. In the western branch the mantled textured feldspar
fenites are considered high-grade. The most striking similarity between this area and
carbonatite-glimmerite-rich areas in the western branch is the luxuriant vegetation
and somewhat micaceous sediments found in ditches and streams.
The medium-grade fenitisation is similar on both branches. They share the
uralitisation and albitisation textures which are the key microscopic textures in the
52

medium-grade fenites across the entire northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex.
The spatial alteration between different grades of fenites is more frequent in the
western branch and the fenite is therefore more heterogeneous. In the eastern branch
the bulk of the aureole is dominated by medium-grade fenites composed of different
alkaline feldspar and aegirine-augite concentrations.

6.5 Desilication and silicification
The presence of quartz in fenites is common throughout fenite aureoles around the
world including the Siilinjärvi alkali complex. Quartz exists mostly in fenites that are
on the edges of the fenite aureole i.e. the low-grade fenites. This occurs at e.g Alnö,
Fen and Iivaara alkaline complexes, where fenitisation has affected a granite gneiss
(Morogan, 1994; Sindern & Kramm, 2000; Kresten & Morogan, 1986). A quartz-rich
fenite is often categorised as a low- to medium-grade fenite since they are usually
furthest away from the intrusion and the desilication has affected these fenites less
with relict quartz still present. The desilication of the country rock is the first reaction
to occur during fenitisation and is a common denominator among fenites (Le Bas,
2008).
The destination of the mobilised silica is contested. Silicification in form of quartz
grains and quartz-rich veins is common around the edges of the Siilinjärvi complex.
This is also the suggested destination of the silica at some areas in the Fen and Sokli
complexes (Kresten & Morogan 1986 and Vartiainen & Woolley 1976). The
quartz-rich fenites near the intrusion are also formed by silicification. But instead of
the fluids travelling outwards to the periphery, the silica travels inwards, towards the
intrusion. Silicification near the intrusion has been recorded at Alnö where calcite
and silica have formed wollastonite in the contact to the carbonatite (Skelton et al.,
2007). At Melteig, in the Fen complex (Norway), quartz is observed in fenites, that
are classified as high-grade because of their close proximity to the intrusion (Kresten,
1988). Similar to the observations at outcrop SIKA-2018-191, SIKA-2018-193 and
SIKA-2018-195 the quartz in Melteig is opalescent and contains amphibole
inclusions. Speculation of the protolith can arise as well as the P-T-X conditions,
which can vary. Coincidentally, the same samples from Fen, which share a similar
silicification pattern as the aforementioned Siilinjärvi samples, also share the highest
53

gains in Na-content (Kresten, 1988). This may rule out the possibility of a different
protolith and favor the hypothesis of varying P-T-X conditions within the system
allowing silicification near the intrusion.

6.5.1 Blue quartz
The Na-rich fenites in Siilinjärvi contain quartz with a blue hue. The amount of
quartz in these fenites is abnormal since it could be classified as a main mineral. It
also occurs solely in fenites with a higher than normal sodium content together with
the blue amphibole, which is presumed to be richterite or riebeckite. Quartz can
appear blue because of small needle-like inclusions of riebeckite in the quartz.
Interestingly, blue quartz occurs also in the basement gneiss ca 5 km west of the
Siilinjärvi alkali complex. The blue quartz grains are up to 1 cm across and are
scattered over a substantial area. Their age is presumed to be Archean, since they are
absent from rocks that are determined to be Proterozoic (Lukkarinen, 2008).
According to Lukkarinen (2008) the presumed source of the blue quartz is the alkali
metasomatism that occured during the emplacement of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex.

6.5.2 Role of the pyroxenes
Pyroxene replaces quartz during fenitisation and forms as a result of fenitising fluid
phases and SiO2 (Sinder & Kramm, 2000) This is observed in early formation of
aegirine-augite at Sokli, which is in between quartz and alkaline feldspar (Vartiainen
& Woolley, 1976). The clinopyroxene aegirine-augite is the main mafic mineral in
Siilinjärvi fenites and occurs mostly as aggregates and veins. The aggregates can be
up to a metre in diameter while the veins range from 1 cm to a metre in width. These
can contain quartz grains either in the core or at the edges of the so called
pyroxenites.
The importance of the vein-type pyroxenite is highlighted by Sinder & Kramm
(2000). During fenitisation the removal of silica causes a loss of volume in the rock.
However, taking into account the vein pyroxenites the loss of volume is decreased
significantly. According to Sinder & Kramm (2000) the pyroxenite veins at Iivara are
formed by the reaction of the intrusion derived fenitising fluid phase and SiO2, which
54

is supported by the 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio of the Iivara pyroxenite veins. The Iivara
pyroxenite veins have an 87Sr/86Sr ratio between the fenitising fluid phase and the
fenite in which the pyroxenite veins occur, suggesting that the pyroxenite veins are
the result of the interaction between the fenitising fluid phase and the SiO2 released
by the surrounding fenite. This means that SiO2 is not transported out of the system
during fenitisation but instead forms pyroxenite veins and aggregates, balancing out
the volume loss of the fenite. The similarities between the Iivara and Siilinjärvi
pyroxenite veins are abundant. They share the mineralogy of aegirine-augite with
minor alkaline feldspar and quartz. The grain size of the pyrexenites is also usually
larger when compered to the surrounding fenite.

6.6 Relict or metasomatic alkaline feldspar
The composition of the basement gneiss is largely homogeneous with the only
variable being the amount of microcline. It can be completely absent or an accessory
mineral. This causes a few issues in determining the origin of microclines and
orthoclases in low- to medium-grade fenites. The alkaline feldspars formed during
fenitisation replaces biotite at the onset of fenitisation. This means that primary and
secondary alkaline feldspar can be present at the same time. Reports from Alnö and
Fen suggest that primary microcline is more stable than the plagioclase, which is
quickly turbidised and consumed (Morogan, 1994 and references therein).
Albitisation can occur along the edges of primary microcline. Albitisation is widely
observed in all fenite grades in this study. With fenitisation reaching medium-grade
the primary microline is turbidised, or in Na-fenites, completely altered in to albite
(Le Bas, 2008). In Siilinjärvi the latter does not occur. However, the existence of
perthite in medium-grade fenites and their sutured margins could indicate that these
alkine feldspars are secondary. This is because perthite is not observed in the
Siilinjärvi migmatitic gneiss and sutured margins are a sign of recrystallization
(Kresten & Morogan, 1986).
The mantle-textured feldspars are unique in a sense that they do not display albitised
margins neither in µXRF analysis nor thin section. The Ti, Sr and Ba anomaly
observed in the µXRF analysis are considered to be caused by the inclusions within
the feldspars. The inclusions are completely absent from the rim of the feldspars,
55

which creates the mantle texture appearance and the Ti, Sr and Ba anomaly. The
anomaly is also observed in perthites in sample SIKA-2018-191.1 and in the field
(Fig. 31). These inclusions could be relict mica and plagioclase from which the
metasomatic feldspar has formed (Vartiainen & Woolley, 1976).

6.7 Challenges in defining fenitisation grade
The northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex is comprised of mineralogically
and texturally different fenites in a large 8 km2-area. Identifying different fenitisation
types is usually based on the distance from the intrusion and the mineralogy of the
fenite. The gradual zoning of the fenitisation grade is successfully observed at e.g.
the Loe Sihlman carbonatite complex in Pakistan, where the fenitisation has affected
the wall rock up to 100 metres, from the intrusion (Mian & Le Bas, 1988).
Difficulties arise when judging fenitisation grades in an asymmetrical complex and
the subsequent asymmetry of the fenite aureole. In the studied area at Siilinjärvi the
asymmetry is apparent by the branching of the complex and the lack of evidence for
the carbonatite-glimmerite intrusion on the eastern branch. This means that on the
eastern branch there is no reference distance between the fenite and the intrusion,
which is one of the main methods in defining the fenitisation grade. Despite this, in
multiple fenite aureoles around the world it has been reported that a continuous
gradation of fenitisation from low-grade to contact fenite in the aureole cannot be
observed (Morogan & Woolley, 1988).
The geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of two supposedly high-grade
fenites can also differ within an aureole. The quartz-rich sample with blue amphibole
(SIKA-2018-191.1) and the perthitic feldspar with major titanite sample
(SIKA-2018-224.1) are both deemed high-grade fenites but for different reasons. In
SIKA-2018-191.1 amphibole is dominant over pyroxene, implying a developed
uralitic alteration connected to the later Na-rich fenitisation. In SIKA-2018-224.1
titanite is in abundance. Titanite is connected to multiple high-grade fenites such as
nepheline fenites and is found together with secondary biotite and garnet in other
fenite aureoles globally (Morogan & Woolley, 1988; Le Bas, 2008). However, Ti is
not considered a mobile element during fenitisation, which suggests that the presence
of titanite is not due to the high grade of fenitisation.

57

7 Conclusions
The fenite in the northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex is heterogeneous due
to the multiple mineralogical and textural variations. These variations are the result
of a polymetasomatic fenitisation that has affected the basement migmatitic gneiss
country rock. The most common type of fenite is the medium-grade alkaline feldspar
and aegirine-augite fenite, which most of the eastern fenite branch are composed of.
The medium-grade fenite has characteristic microtextures, which demonstrate that
both K and Na have been mobile during the fenitisation. The fenitisation process,
however, has been K-dominant since the bulk of the fenite consists of alkaline
feldspar, aegirine-augite and iron oxides. Na-fenitisation is responsible for the
albitisation and uralitisation textures formed on both primary and, secondary
minerals. The low-grade fenites are found close to the unaltered basement gneiss. In
these fenites relict biotite and quartz are present together with metasomatic textures
and minerals caused by fenitisation such as pyroxene and the breakdown of
plagioclase into alkaline feldspars. The formation of different high-grade fenites is a
sign of differing P-T-X conditions during the fenitisation process. Quartz-enriched
high-grade fenites show that most of the silica has stayed in the system during the
formation of the fenite aureole, which is supported by pyroxene veinlets found in
lower-grade fenites. Some phlogopitisation in the fenites is observed closest to the
intrusion, further indicating a K-dominant fenitisation of the basement gneiss. The
fenite in the northern part of the Siilinjärvi alkali complex is mostly K-dominant with
influxes of Na that has formed distinct metasomatic textures and mineral
assemblages.

Swedish summary - Svensk sammanfattning
Siilinjärvi-alkalikomplexet består av en karbonatitglimmeritmalmkropp samt
sidobergarterna fenit, gnejs och metadiabas. Karbonatitglimmeritintrusionen är ca 16
km lång och 900 m bred och sträcker sig i en nordsydlig riktning. Intrusionen är 2,6
Ga gammal och har intruderat det 2,8 Ga gamla bottengnejskomplexet. Intrusionen är
omringad av en fenitaureol och alkalikomplexet skärs av flera metadiabasgångar med
en nordvästlig-sydostlig riktning. Idag bryter Yara Suomi Oy apatitmalm i två
dagbrott i Siilinjärvi.
En fenit är en metsomatisk bergart som har formats runt eller i närheten av
karbonatiter och alkaliska intrusioner. Dessa intrusioner friger alkaliska fluider som
förändrar sidoberget till fenit. Fenitiserande fluider består till största delen av K2O,
Na2O, CaO, FeO, MgO, H2O och CO2. De förändrar sidoberget samtidigt som SiO2
lösgörs. Flera faktorer påverkar fenitisering och slutlig bildning av fenit, de största
faktorerna är de ovannämnda fenitiserande fluiderna samt tryck och temperatur.
Protoliten och intrusionens sammansättning har däremot en mindre påverkan. Alla
dessa faktorer gör att flera olika feniter uppstår och att fenitisering kan leda till en
oändlig mängd av fenitvariationer. Fenitisering beskrivs bäst som en process där
alkalierna ökar och mängden kisel minskar (desilikation), vilket även syns i fenitens
59

mineralogi. Sidoberg som påverkats litet av fenitiserande fluider innehåller kvarts
medan sidoberg som totalt förändrats till fenit innehåller alkaliska mineral såsom
alkalifältspat, pyroxen och alkalisk amfibol.
Fenitens

protolit

i

Siilinjärvi

är

en

migmatitisk

gnejs

med

en

tonalit-trondhjemit-granodioritisk (TTG) sammansättning. Gnejsen består till största
del av kvarts, plagioklas, biotit och hornblände. Kalifältspat (mikroklin) är oftast
bara ett accessoriskt mineral. Karbonatit-glimmeritintrusionen består av kalcit,
dolomit, flogopit, apatit och richterit. Malmmineralet apatit förekommer jämt i
bergarter som hör till karbonatit-glimmeritserien i gruvan.
Kategorisering av fenit i olika fenitaureoler varierar globalt. Den mest allmänna
kategoriseringen delar in fenit i Na-fenit, K-fenit och intermediär fenit. I denna
avhandling tillämpas vidare kategorisering av låg-, medel- och höggradig fenit, samt
kontaktfenit. Dessa termer beskriver fenitens intensitetsgrad, och distansen mellan
feniten och intrusionen som de fenitiserande fluiderna härstammar från. Låggradig
fenit innehåller texturer som finns i protoliten men med fenitisk mineralogi.
Medelgradig fenit är dominerad av fenitiska mineral men kan även bestå av relikta
mineral och texturer. I höggradig fenit har alla protolitens mineral förändrats till
fenitmineral. Höggradig fenit har oftast magmatisk textur och feniten kan därför
blandas med den geokemiskt liknande magmatiska bergarten syenit. En kontaktfenit
sträcker sig oftast bara några meter från intrusionen. Mineralogin i kontaktfeniter
reflekterar oftast intrusionens mineralogi.
Fenitiseringsprocessen för en granitisk protolit börjar med omvandling av plagioklas
och nedbrytning av biotit till alkalifältspat. Kvarts får en undulerande utsläckning
och förändras till pyroxen (vanligen ägirin-augit) under intensivare fenitisering.
Pyroxen och alkaliamfibol formas i första hand vid korngränserna mellan
alkalifältspat och kvarts. Vid vidare fenitisering förbrukas kvartsen totalt, vilket
formar pyroxen och amfibol. Albit formas i kornkanterna av relikt alkalifältspat eller
i nyformad alkalifältspat. I medel- och höggradig fenit kan också pertit formas i
samband med sk. ‘chessboard’-albit. I höggradiga feniter är förhållandet mellan
kalium

(K)

och

natrium

(Na)

den

största

kontrollerande

faktorn

på

mineralparagenesen. I K-dominerande feniter är huvudmineralen mikroklin, ortoklas,
pyroxen och flogopit medan i Na-dominerande feniter är huvudmineralen albit, pertit

60

och Na-amfibol.
Syftet med avhandlingen är att karakterisera och definiera olika fenittyper i norra
delen av Siilinjärvi-alkalikomplexet. I detta område fördelar sig fenitaureolen i en
västlig och en östlig gren. Fältkartering utfördes i området under sommaren 2018.
Totalt gjordes 244 bergartsobservationer på det 8 km2 stora karteringsområdet. De
plockade bergartsproven var från fenitlokaler där fenitens mineralogi och textur
representerade den lokala fenittypen. Referensprov av karteringsområdets gnejs och
karbonatitglimmerit var också tagna. Till tunnslip preparerades 17 handspecimen
och 11 tunnslip analyserades vidare med mikro-XRF.
Resultaten visar att fenitens färg varierar i fält från röd till blekröd, och kan i vissa
fall vara nästan vit. Feniten består till största delen av röd alkalifältspat och
mörkgrön klinopyroxen. Klinoyroxenen formar ställvis stora aggregat och gångar
tillsammans med kvarts. Kvarts kan vara huvudmineral i låggradig och i höggradig
fenit. Magnetit och andra Fe-oxider förekommer i feniter som observerats i östra
fenitgrenen. Amfibolen, till skillnad från pyroxenen, är blå i fält och har observerats
bara på den västra fenitgrenen i närheten av bergarter som hörs till
karbonatit-glimmeritserien.
Resultaten från petrografisk tunnslipsanalys stöder mineralogiska observationer i fält.
Alkalifältspaten är mikroklin eller ortoklas och klinopyroxenen är ägirin-augit. De är
huvudmineralen i största delen av tunnslipen. Opaka mineral, kalcit, amfibol och
kvarts är de mest förekommande accessoriska mineralen. Flera mikrotexturer är
observerbara och kan förknippas med omvandling och omkristallation. Runt
alkalifältspatkornen

formas

en

koronatextur

av

fältspatkorn

som

med

mikro-XRF-analys identifierats vara albit. Denna albitisering sker huvudsakligen i
prov som är tagna från medelgradiga feniter. En liknande koronatextur förekommer i
pyroxenerna. Pyroxenens kornkanter har ställvis omvandlats till amfibol och format
en uralitiseringstextur.
Bergartsproven som är tagna inom en några hundra meters radie från intrusionen
visar stora variationer i mineralogin. Mikro-XRF-analysen av en fenittyp med
alkalifältspat visar att Sr, Ba och Ti utarmats vid kornkanterna. Detta har lett till att
alkalifältspaten fått ett mantlat utseende. Mikro-XRF-analysen, som är kopplad till
den petrografiska analysen, påvisar att alkalifältspatens kärna innehåller små
61

mineralinklusioner. Dessa antas vara relikta mineral som förblivit i alkalifältspaten
under bildandet av mineralet i fenitiseringsprocessen. Denna fenittyp klassas som en
höggradig fenit.
Den amfibolrika fenittypen klassas även som en höggradig fenit. Mineralparagenesen
av Na-amfibol, kvarts och pertit avviker från den tidigare nämnda fenittypen. Denna
fenit har bildats till största delen av Na-dominerande fenitiserande fluider. Kvartsen
har förblivit i denna fenit trots att fenitisering är en process där kiselhalten minskar.
Minskningen av kiselhalten under fenitiseringen orsakar en stor volymminskning
från ursprungsbergarten gnejs. Kiseln försvinner däremot inte från systemet, utan
bildar pyroxenådror och -aggregat i feniten tillsammans med fenitiserande fluider.
Dessa aggregat bildas i låg- och medelgradiga feniter som tyder på att fluiderna och
kiseln

drivs

bort

från

fenitiserande

fluidernas

ursprungskälla

dvs.

karbonatitglimmeritintrusionen. Tryck- och temperaturförhållandenas fluktuering
under fenitiseringsprocessen kan ge upphov till kvartsrika feniter nära intrusionen. I
dessa fall transporteras kiseln mot intrusionen.
Feniten i norra delen av Siilinjärvi-alkalikomplexet har bildats både genom K- och
Na-fenitisering. Uralitisering och albitisering tyder på en senare Na-fenitisering efter
en K-dominerad fenitiseringshändelse. Den K-dominerande fenitiseringen har bildat
en medelgradig fenit som huvudsakligen består av alkalifältspat och klinopyroxenen
ägirin-augit. Bildningen av flogopit i kontaktfeniter som observerats i fält stöder
hypotesen av K-fenitisering. Amfibol och pertit som förekommer i vissa höggradiga
feniter är ett tecken på hög variation av Na/K-förhållande i de fenitiserande fluider
som förekommer i Siilinjärvi-alkalikomplexet.
