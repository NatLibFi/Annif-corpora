ABSTRACT
The demand for bio-based and bio-degradable products is expanding at fast rate, increasing
the need of bio-based stabilizers. In this work, the use of bio-based stabilizers in hydrophobic
nanoparticle dispersions was investigated. These dispersions are applied in surface sizing of
paperboard, making the properties of the dispersion important. The aim of reaching certain
properties concerning solids content, viscosity and particle size, along with no residual
monomers in the dispersion, was challenging. Factors, such as, pH, temperature and amount
of stabilizer and initiator, were investigated in the dispersion polymerization process.
The polymerization reaction was faster at pH 5.0 and 6.0 compared to lower pH, making the
target solids content of 25% reached in a shorter time. Furthermore, the particle size
distribution (PSD) was narrower, but the amount of residual monomers in the dispersion was
lower at lower pH values. A second feed of initiator was added to most polymerizations, to
finalize the polymerization of the monomers and to reach the theoretical solids content. The
goal of solids content was reached in shorter time at higher temperature, but these dispersions
had clear phase separations, indicating the dispersions were unstable, and the dispersions
contained large amounts of monomers.
Many dispersions had a very broad PSD and contained small amounts of very large particles,
along with unpolymerized monomers. However, the particles in the dispersions were in
average almost five times larger compared to particles in a reference dispersion, stabilized
with a known polysaccharide-based stabilizer. By increasing the amount of stabilizer with
almost 40% in addition to the original amount, the PSD became narrower and the dispersion
did not contain any larger aggregates. The colloidal stability of the dispersions was good and
even better than the reference dispersion. The particles did not degrade over a period of 16
weeks, nor sediment, making the stability of the dispersions promising.

1 INTRODUCTION
The need of bio-based and bio-degradable materials, along with low carbon footprint, are
increasing in the society of today. Better and more eco-friendly materials are constantly
investigated and developed. To change a previously synthetic non-renewable material
towards a more bio-friendly product, variables need to be replaced one at a time.
Bio-based stabilizers need to have similar or better properties to be able to replace synthetic
or inorganic stabilizers. Natural stabilizers are found in large quantities in nature, and
polymers, such as, cellulose, lignin, chitosan and hemicellulose, to mention a few, are widely
used in the industry and in different applications (Doelker, 2005). The focus in this thesis is
on the colloidal stability of a dispersion, i.e., how bio-based materials prevent aggregation of
particles in the dispersion.
In this thesis, the dispersions made will be utilized in surface sizing of paper board. In the
surface sizing process, the fibers on the surface of the paper are sealed by the addition of
specific compounds, such as starch. This increases the paper strength and improve the
surface properties for further modification of the paper (Dai, et al., 2011).

1.1 Definitions and desired properties
Nanoparticles are defined as particles with at least one dimension of 100 nm or less. The
chemical and physical properties of the nanoparticles should differ from those of the bulk
compounds (Kumar, et al., 2009). Because of high surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional
characteristics, such as electric and optical properties, nanoparticles can be utilized in many
applications, e.g., in medicine and pharmaceutical industries (Guerrini, et al., 2018).
A dispersion is a blend of a material dispersed in another material. The dispersed compound
can be in the same or in different state as the continuous phase, where the continuous phase
is defined as the phase in which fluid or solid particles are dispersed. A suspension is a
subsection of a dispersion, where solid particles are dissolved in a liquid media (Mewis &
Vermant, 2000). Furthermore, colloidal dispersions usually contain smaller particles and will
not settle over time. Nanoparticle dispersions are considered colloidal systems, where the
particles will either flocculate or remain dispersed, but not sediment, depending on the
desired stability. The stabilizer can protect the polymers inside the particles from external
influence, but the stabilizer alone cannot determine the lifetime of the polymer, i.e., how fast
or slow the polymer degrades (Katainen, et al., 2006; Mewis & Vermant, 2000).
The dispersions polymerized in this thesis work will be applied in surface sizing of paper
board, hence target properties concerning solids content and viscosity along with particle
size and particle size distribution (PSD) are of importance. Polymer particles at nanoscale
have a large surface area, and therefore, greater adhesive forces than larger particles.
Larger particles have more interaction with the paper and have a major impact on the
adhesion between the two surfaces (Katainen, et al., 2006). Hydrophobic particles have
lower surface energy compared to hydrophilic materials, and this generates a water-repellant
surface. The hydrophobicity of a material can be determined by calculating the contact angle
between the surface and a droplet, where the surface is hydrophobic if the contact angle is
≥ 90° (Güleç, et al., 2005).

1.1.1 Target properties
To be utilized in surface sizing, the dispersion must have certain properties. The desired
properties of the dispersion for the target application, are described in Table 1.1. The target
was to reach a dispersion with particles at nanoscale and with a low viscosity, to facilitate
the surface sizing process.

1.2 Electrostatic and steric stabilization
The electrostatic potential is one of many important factors concerning the stability of a
dispersion (Rescignano, et al., 2014). In the DLVO theory (established and named after
Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek), the zeta potential (ζ-potential) explains how
forces are developed between two particles approaching each other. The theory describes
two main forces between a pair of colloidal particles: van der Waals forces (attractive) and
electrostatic forces (repulsive). The overall interaction is either attractive or repulsive,
depending on the balance between these two forces. Hydrogen bonds are also considered
attractive forces in dispersions with high solids content. If the ζ-potential is close to zero, the
attractive forces might outpace the repulsion forces and the polymeric dispersion will
flocculate. Colloids with a higher positive or lower negative ζ-potential are therefore
electrostatically stabilized, since the charge of the particles repel each other (Ishikawa, et al.,
2005).
By adding electrolytes to the dispersion, more ions are concentrated around the particles,
shielding the charge of the particle, see Figure 1.1. If two or more particles are close to each
other, the concentration of ions generates an osmotic pressure and the particles will repel
each other. If the distance between the two particles is short enough, attractive forces

3

Isabella Laurén

overcome the osmotic pressure, and when these forces increase, the colloidal stability
decreases, resulting in coagulation (Bowen & Williams, 1996).

Figure 1.1 Sketch of a charged particle and its potential difference and ionic concentration.
The ions close to the particle are strongly bound to the particle, whereas in the diffuse layer,
the ions are loosely attached to the negatively charged particle. Picture adapted from
(NanoComposix, 2019).
Particle dispersions can also be stabilized by steric stabilization, where additives inhibit the
coagulation. These non-ionic macromolecules, such as hydrophilic surfactants and polymers,
are absorbed onto the surface of the particles with side chains into the medium. High surface
coverage is of importance. Sterically stabilized systems tend to persist being well dispersed
even at zero ζ-potential and at increasing concentrations of electrolytes (Parfitt & Barnes,
1997).
To maintain the stability of a nanoparticle dispersion, steric and electrostatic stabilization can
be combined. In this case, polyelectrolytes can be used as polymeric surfactants. Such
substances have polar head-group that generate the electric double layer, while its side
chains provide steric repulsion (Ivanov & Ivanov, 2012). Steric stabilization is not sensitive
to fluctuations in ionic strength or pH, however, the temperature might affect the stability
(Mewis & Vermant, 2000). Many steric stabilizers are surface active, and some stabilizers
adsorb onto the surface of the particles (Paine, 1990).

1.2.1 Stability of a dispersion
By modifying the surface of the nanoparticles, the repulsive forces between the particles are
improved and the dispersion can be more stable. One of the easiest techniques to modify
the surface is by adsorption of polymeric compounds onto the surface, furthermore, the
roughness and surface energy can as well be altered, among other things. Parameters such
as pH, molar and molecular mass, size, structure and charge of the surfactant are of
importance. To disperse hydrophobic nanoparticles in an aqueous media, polymers with both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups are used: the hydrophobic parts are involved in the
adsorption of surfactants onto the hydrophobic nanoparticle, while the hydrophilic segments
improve the compatibility between the particle and the aqueous media. In hydrophobic
systems, the interface between the solvent and the particle affect the behavior of the system
(Iijima & Kamiya, 2009).
Another method to ensure colloidal stability is by grafting polymeric macromolecules onto
the surfaces of the particles, to form a protective layer, and the dispersion is therefore
sterically stabilized. Due to van der Waals attractions, the layer prevents the particles to
aggregate (Zhulina, et al., 1990).
Considering economic reasons and the aspiration to minimize potential toxic leakages, the
amount of stabilizer or other additives to increase the stability of a dispersion should be as
low as possible. To decrease the degradation of a polymer dispersion, the stabilizer needs
to, e.g., react with free radicals or with chain ends. Generally, a variety and different
combinations of stabilizers are used for the dispersion to operate under different conditions
(Villain, et al., 1995).

1.3 Heterophase radical polymerization
Heterophase polymerization is commonly described as the process producing polymer
dispersions, or latexes, where polymers are dispersed in a continuous phase, usually water
(Asua & Schoonbrood, 1999). Emulsion polymerization is the most common polymerization
process, where the monomers are fed to the reactor with constant rate and the polymer is
created by nucleation processes (Antonietti & Tauer, 2003). The first step of the
polymerization process is the initiation, where an initiator and catalyst form radicals, and then
transferred to the monomer present. Further, more and more monomer units are added to
the chain, in a propagation process that creates the most stable radical (Reusch, 2015). A
radical polymerization of styrene is illustrated in Figure 1.2, explaining a polymerization
5

reaction. Free radicals are formed in the redox initiation process from e.g. peroxides as
initiator and with ferrous ions as catalysts (Braun, 2009).

Figure 1.2 Illustration of a radical polymerization of styrene. Equation 1 and 2 are explaining
the redox initiation process, and equation 3 and 4 are illustrating the chain propagation,
creating a polystyrene (PS) chain. Picture adapted from (Reusch, 2015).
In this thesis work, the dispersions were polymerized with a radical emulsion polymerization
process. To interrupt the polymer chain growth, a chain-transfer agent is added. This
compound has at least one weak bond and can therefore react with the radical position of
the polymer chain. In this reaction, the radical is momentarily transferred to the chain-transfer
agent and further transferred to a monomer or another polymer to initiate the growth
(Monteiro & de Barbeyrac, 2001).

2 LITERATURE STUDY
A review of potential bio-based stabilizers and their properties in the stabilization of
nanoparticle dispersions was undertaken. Only non-ionic and anionic compounds were
taken into consideration, according to the research plan. Stabilizers work according to
different mechanisms, depending on if they stabilize the interface of the dispersion or if the
stabilizer protects the material against external influences, such as oxygen or UV-radiation.
Considering the scope of this thesis, bio-based stabilizers which protect the polymer from
external influences, such as antioxidants, are not included in the literature study.
Stabilizers in dispersions inhibit or delay the degradation of the polymer, preventing the
particles to aggregate or the material to lose its properties. The stability depends on the
concentration and type of stabilizer. Using bio-based stabilizers in hydrophobic dispersions
can be divided into two approaches: doing the polymerization with the stabilizer present (insitu) or blending the stabilizer with the polymer after the polymerization (ex-situ). The in-situ
approach reduces the processing steps and potential errors and manipulations (Bel Haaj, et
al., 2014).

2.1 Soluble stabilizers
The focus in this thesis was on water-soluble stabilizers. This chapter is divided into
structures with lower molar mass (Chapter 2.1.1 - 2.1.3) and components with higher molar
mass (Chapter 2.1.4 - 2.1.7).

2.1.1 Biosurfactants
Surfactants are surface-active molecules, since they consist of both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic groups, with a diverse field of applications, e.g., in the oil, food and mining
industries (Vijayakumar & Saravanan, 2015; Rosenberg & Ron, 1999). Biosurfactants are
produced by micro-organisms, and can be used as stabilizers, emulsifiers, foaming agents
etc. The broad area of application is due to their ability to increase the solubility and the
surface area of hydrophobic water-insoluble substances, and to reduce the surface tension
(Vijayakumar & Saravanan, 2015). Biosurfactants with lower molar mass, such as glycolipids,
lower the surface tension, whereas substances with higher molar mass are more efficient in
stabilizing emulsions (Rosenberg & Ron, 1999).

2.1.2 Phenolic polymers
Natural phenols consist of an aromatic hydrocarbon group bonded to a hydroxyl group, and
are widely found in nature, where lignin is the most eminent compound (Panzella &
Napolitano, 2017).

Lignin
Lignin is a phenolic polymer found in higher plants, mostly in wood, and is generally obtained
as a by-product from the pulp production. The properties vary depending on the plant origin
and isolation method, for the moment is most of the lignin obtained used as energy. To be
used as a stabilizer for polymer emulsions, the compound should have quite low molecular
mass and limited molecular polydispersity (Gregorová, et al., 2005). Lignin is classified as a
non-enzymatic natural antioxidant and can lower the formation of free radicals and reactive
oxygen during processing and application. Lignin reacts with, e.g., peroxy radicals and
transition metals. Due to its phenolic hydroxyl groups and polyphenol structure, lignin has a
stabilizing and radical scavenging effect in polymers (Kirschweng, et al., 2017). According to
experiments mentioned in the article “Natural antioxidants as stabilizers for polymers” by
Kirschweng et al. (2017), the stabilizing effects of lignin has been mostly studied in PP, PE,
PLA and PCL. In the polymer industry, lignin is mainly used as fillers.
In research done by Schmidt et al. (2017), lignin fragments were successfully used as a
stabilizer of styrene in an emulsion polymerization process. Depending on the concentration
of the stabilizer, a polystyrene latex with a solids content of 21% was obtained. Furthermore,
the stabilizer showed comparable properties and efficiencies with those of stabilizers based
on non-renewable compounds, such as nonylphenol or methylparaben. However, the
dispersions coagulated unexpectedly to some extent, indicating on a complicated phase
behavior.

Lignosulfonates
Lignosulfonates are produced during the delignification step in the sulfite pulping process.
They have an incredibly broad range of molar mass and can be separated from the black
liquor by, e.g., ultrafiltration. As of today, the main applications of lignosulfonates are as
plasticizer and binder in concrete, making the concrete stronger by reducing the amount of
added water. The lignosulfonate molecule has both lipophilic and hydrophilic parts, and,
according to Gundersen & Sjöblom (1999), the molecule does not have high surface activity
8

Isabella Laurén

although it is divided into lipophilic and hydrophilic components. Discoloring is considered a
disadvantage concerning the use of lignin and lignosulfonates (Gundersen & Sjöblom, 1999).

2.1.3 Alginates
Alginates are the main structural element in, i.a., Phaeophyceae (marine brown algae) and
a polysaccharide in soil bacteria. They consist of varying sequences of α-L-guluronic acid
and β-D-mannuronic acid residues, see Figure 2.1. According to K.I. Draget (2009), alginates
do not have regular repeating units and the sequences depend on the species in question,
e.g. bacteria can consist of up to 100% mannuronic acid. Alginates as a resource is regarded
as an unlimited source, even for a growing industry, since the production of algae by
fermentation is possible but limited today, due to economic aspects.

Figure 2.1 Chemical structure of alginates: 1) α-L-guluronate (G) and β-D-mannuronate (M)
as monomers, 2) chain conformation and 3) block distribution of alginates. Picture adapted
from (Draget & Taylor, 2009).
In brown algae, this polysaccharide occurs as a gel that also contains, e.g., calcium, sodium
and magnesium ions (Draget, 2009). Thanks to the ability to retain water, along with their
viscosifying, stabilizing and gelling properties, alginates are extensively used in different
industrial applications (Nan, et al., 2014). The gelling abilities of alginates are based on their
ion-binding properties and are independent of temperature. On the other hand, parameters
such as chemical composition, sequence, alginate concentration and the ratio gelling/nongelling ions are important and need to be optimized. Alginates might interact with other
charged compounds, e.g. proteins, since they are polyelectrolytes, resulting in phase

9

Isabella Laurén

transitions or changes in viscosity. These interactions are of importance in stabilization of a
dispersion (Draget, 2009).
According to research done by Daemi et al. (2013), when a solution of sodium alginates and
aqueous polyurethane was prepared, the alginates were distributed as agglomerations in
the polymer matrix. Also, the hydrophilicity of the blend increased with increasing content of
sodium alginate. In another similar research, done by Yun et al. (2007), the properties of a
blend between aqueous sodium alginates and polyurethane-urea as a coating material with
high water vapor permeability (WVP), were investigated. The aim was to create a stable
formation of a micropore structure. According to the study, the dispersion was stable when
the content of sodium alginates was approximately 30 wt.%. Films containing sodium
alginates had larger and more micropores, compared to films done with only polyurethaneurea. Also, the WVP was significantly increased in dispersions containing more sodium
alginate. This study was utilized in creating better breathable fabrics.

2.1.4 Cellulose
Cellulose is the most important polymeric component in plants. It is composed of repeated
D-glucose blocks and is a linear semi-crystalline polysaccharide with fascinating properties.
Cellulose is described by, e.g., its chirality, hydrophilicity, chemical modifying capacity and
biodegradability. It has both crystalline and non-crystalline regions and is insoluble in most
organic solvents and in water, due to its supramolecular structure (Klemm, et al., 2005).
Cellulose derivatives can be grafted with synthetic polymers to create amphiphilic materials.
Grafted polymers are co-polymers where the main-chain and the branches are different
compounds. This gives the polymer new characteristics, such as adhesion, hydrophilicity or
biocompatibility (Paine, 1990). These derivatives are used in many applications, such as,
cosmetics, food, packaging and pharmaceutics, thanks to their non-toxic nature (Rescignano,
et al., 2014; Doelker, 2005).

Hydroxypropyl cellulose, HPC
Hydroxypropyl cellulose, HPC, is one of many derivatives from cellulose, this polymer is
soluble in both water and in organic solvents (Chattopadhyay, et al., 2001). HPC is a
branched, anionic polysaccharide and widely used as a thickening agent due to its surfaceactive properties (Mezdour, et al., 2008).

10

Isabella Laurén

According to experiments described in the article “Dispersion polymerization of styrene in
polar solvents. IV. Influence of reaction parameters on particle size and molar mass on
Poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-stabilized reactions”, by Paine et al. (1990), by using HPC as a
stabilizer in the polymerization of styrene, the HPC become grafted and end up as 10 – 20
nm thick layers on the surface of the styrene particles. The initial styrene concentration
determines the particle dispersity, lower concentrations result in monodisperse particles
while polydispersity is a result of higher styrene concentrations. However, the average
molecular mass remained practically constant. Depending on the solvent used in dispersion
polymerization of styrene with HPC as a stabilizer, the particle size varies (Paine, et al., 1990;
Paine, 1990).

2.1.5 Chitosan
One of the most important natural polymers is chitin, a polysaccharide found in many
crustaceans and in some insects and microorganisms. The main sources of commercial
chitin are shrimp and crab shells and is extracted by acid treatment followed by an alkaline
treatment. Chitosan is a derivative of chitin; when the deacetylation of chitin under alkaline
conditions reaches 50%, the polymer becomes soluble in aqueous acidic solution. Due to
the semi-crystalline structure of chitin, chitosan has acetyl groups distributed along its chains
(Rinaudo, 2006). The properties of chitosan depend on its degree of acetylation (DA) and
the distribution of the acetyl groups along the polymer chain (Phan, et al., 2019). Chitin is
harder to process compared to chitosan, however, chitosan has a lower stability due to a
more hydrophilic nature and pH sensitivity. Chitosan is a non-toxic cationic polymer and is
utilized to prepare films, hydrogels fibers etc., mostly in the biomedical field (Rescignano, et
al., 2014; Rinaudo, 2014).
According to research done by Marie et al. (2002), mere chitosan as a stabilizing agent for
nanoparticle emulsions is insufficient. As stated in the experiment in the article “Synthesis of
chitosan-stabilized polymer dispersions, capsules, and chitosan grafting products via miniemulsions”, chitosan cannot prevent the polymer particles from coagulation. However, by
adding small quantities of some other surfactant with low molar mass or a flexible polymer
as a co-stabilizer, the structure on the surface of the particles improves significantly and the
overall stability is enhanced.

2.1.6 Hemicelluloses
Hemicelluloses are polysaccharides found in cell walls of plants and they are the third most
abundant polymer found in plants, after cellulose and lignin. The structure and the amount
of hemicelluloses vary depending on the plant type. They are soluble in alkaline
environments, arabinogalactan (AG) from larch is also extractable in hot water. Some parts
of the hemicellulose are entrapped in cellulose or lignin or is bond to them by hydrogen
bonds. The lower the molar mass, the easier solubilized in the solution. Also, the degree of
branching and content of uronic acid and acetyl groups influence the solubility.
Hemicelluloses are destroyed during the kraft pulping process, but can be extracted from
wood by hot-water extraction (Whistler, 1993).
In a research done by Zhang et al. (2015), an emulsion polymerization of acrylamide and
butyl acrylate was done using hemicellulose as a stabilizer, generating a monomer
conversion of almost 98%. Apart from stabilizing the dispersion, the hemicellulose also
lowered the particle size significantly. This latex was used in water clarification processes,
as an absorbent towards methylene blue dyes.

2.1.7 Other polysaccharides

Pectin
Pectins are a mixture of polysaccharides found in the primary cell walls of almost every plant
grown on land. Commercially, pectin is used as a gelling agent and stabilizer in food and are
mainly extracted from citrus fruits and sugar beet pulps. The structure is quite complex and
depends on the extraction process and the original source. Best emulsifying properties were
found in pectins with a low content of acetyl groups and depending on the extraction method,
low molar mass (60 – 70 kg mol-1 according to Leroux et al. (2002)), and had also a high
degree of methoxylation (Leroux, et al., 2002; Akhtar, et al., 2002). Pectin derived from citrus
fruits have emulsifying properties and the pectin itself is a very surface-active molecule that
can create emulsions with droplets on a smaller scale in oil-in-water emulsions (Verkempinck,
et al., 2018).

2.2 Insoluble stabilizers
Stabilizers insoluble in water are described in the following chapter, with focus on particle
stabilized emulsions.

2.2.1 Pickering emulsions
Pickering emulsions are stabilized by either organic or inorganic colloidal particles, which
form a steric barrier against coalescence around the droplet, whereas surfactants stabilize
classical emulsions, see Figure 2.2 (Chevalier & Bolzinger, 2013; Horozov & Binks, 2006).
Pickering emulsions can be a replacement for classical emulsions in many applications,
since they preserve the main properties of classical emulsions (Chevalier & Bolzinger, 2013).

Figure 2.2 Illustration of Pickering oil-in-water emulsions (left) and classical emulsions
(right). Picture adapted from (Chevalier & Bolzinger, 2013).
By modification of the particle surface, they can be less or more hydrophobic, depending on
the desired outcome of the stabilization (Horozov & Binks, 2006). According to the article
“Ferritin as a bionano-particulate emulsifier” written by Fujii et al. (2009), numerous organic
particles, such as, microgel and core-shell particles or sterically- or charge-stabilized polymer
particles can work as potential particulate stabilizers, i.e., organic polymers turn the surface
of the particle more hydrophobic. Also, inorganic particle, e.g., silica, ceramics, metals or
semiconductors have possibilities in this area.
In the example illustrated in Figure 2.2, the adsorption of the particles at the interface
between oil and water requires partial wetting of the particles by both oil and water. If the
surface of the solid is very hydrophilic, the particle will be entirely wet by water. Additionally,
a hydrophobic surface will be completely wet by the oil. The stability of the emulsion is at

13

Isabella Laurén

maximum when the adsorption is as strong as possible, i.e., when the contact angle between
the solid particle and the liquid is 90° (Chevalier & Bolzinger, 2013).
In experiments explained in the article “Pickering polymerization of styrene stabilized by
starch-based nanospheres”, by Pei et al. (2016), starch is one of the most promising natural
polymers to function as a stabilizer of styrene. Inorganic particles, such as zinc oxide or silica,
have generally been used as stabilizing agents in Pickering emulsions. Nevertheless, these
compounds need modification to obtain stabilizing abilities, contrary to natural polymers such
as starch. In addition, chitosan nanoparticles, cellulose nanofibrils and modified starch
nanoparticles have been utilized in stabilization of Pickering emulsions.

Starch
Starch is a polysaccharide consisting of glucose units linked by α-glycosidic bonds,
compared to β-glycosidic bonds in cellulose. Starch is providing energy to green plants and
is a common compound in the human diets, as it is found in, e.g., potatoes, corn, rice and
wheat. Furthermore, starch is widely used in the food industry due to its stabilizing and
emulsifying properties. Starch is mainly used as a stabilizer in Pickering emulsions (Pei, et
al., 2016).
In a research done by Bel Haaj et al. (2014), latex using starch nanocrystals (SNC) as
stabilizing agent in Pickering emulsions was successfully attained. SNC hydrolyzed by HCl
showed improved stabilization effect and a reduced average particle size, compared to
nanocrystals from H2SO4 hydrolysis. However, the SNC were not sufficient in stabilizing the
monomers by themselves, due to this, a cationic surfactant was added to improve the
stabilization. In another research, done by Pei et al. (2016), starch-based nanospheres were
successfully used as a Pickering stabilizer in the polymerization of styrene.
In the article “Optimization of synthesis and characterization of oxidized starch‐graft‐
poly(styrene‐butyl acrylate) latex for paper coating” by Cheng et al. (2015), different variables
such as, temperature, monomers, initiator etc., were investigated to improve the properties
of the latex used as a binder in paper coating. The best results were achieved at 70°C with
a concentration of 40% monomers, 4.4% stabilizer and 0.3% initiator. According to the
results, these latexes can be used as coating alternatives since they improved the gloss and
picking resistance in coated papers.

3 EXPERIMENTAL PART
The aim of this work was to evaluate performance of different bio-based stabilizers in
nanoparticle dispersions and achieve satisfying dispersion properties. The dispersions will
be utilized in surface sizing of paper board. This means good properties, especially regarding
viscosity and particle size distribution, are desired. The aim to achieve particles at nanoscale
was due to the dispersion’s application in surface sizing, since smaller particles have greater
adhesive forces. Furthermore, the viscosity needed to be below a certain limit, to facilitate
the sizing process.
The reference polymerization was performed using a polysaccharide-based stabilizer, and
the same recipe was used as base recipe in the polymerizations stabilized by other
stabilizers.

3.1 Materials
3.1.1 Stabilizers
The reference polymerization was done by using Stabilizer 1, a polysaccharide dissolved in
water. In most polymerizations, Stabilizer 2 was used, which was a water-soluble compound
consisting of certain polysaccharides combined with lignin-based polyelectrolyte polymers,
and has an average molar mass of approximately 4 500 g/mol. Furthermore, several
polymerizations using Stabilizer 3 were tested, which was a stabilizer consisting of the ligninbased polyelectrolyte in Stabilizer 2, to compare its properties to Stabilizer 2. Stabilizer 1 and
3 were powders, and Stabilizer 2 was in liquid form.

3.1.2 Initiators
Initiator 1 was used in most of the polymerizations, diluted in water into a 3.5 wt.% solution.
In two polymerizations Initiator 2 was utilized, diluted into a 9 wt.% solution. In several
polymerizations, Initiator 3 was added to promote the polymerization and decrease the
amount of residual monomers. An iron catalyst was part of the redox initiation in the
polymerization process.

15

Isabella Laurén

3.1.3 Monomers
The monomer mixture contained three different monomers, named Monomer 1, 2 and 3. All
polymerizations had the same amount of monomers, with a mass ratio of 50% of Monomer
1 and 25% each of Monomer 2 and 3.

3.1.4 Other compounds
The reaction medium was distilled water, and the polymerization was executed in a
continuous flow of nitrogen (N2). Either sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4),
both 30%, were used for pH adjustment. In a few polymerizations, a chain-transfer agent
was added to modify the polymer chain, referred to as Substance A.

3.2 Methods
The standard recipe mentioned in this thesis is referring to the recipe used in the reference
polymerization by Stabilizer 1. Variations in the recipe were made to achieve better results
concerning the polymerization process. The recipe using Stabilizer 1 was used in the first
polymerization using Stabilizer 2, and only adjustments according to the stabilizer’s solids
content were made. The polymerization process is explained in the following section.

3.2.1 The polymerization process
This polymerization is referred to as the standard recipe. The first step in the polymerization
process was to add the stabilizer dissolved in water to the reactor, followed by the addition
of a catalyst as part of the redox initiation. A schematic picture of the reactor is shown in
Figure 3.1, where all these compounds are added through the valve (1). A flow of N2 was
continuously fed through the system, (2).

The compounds were mixed during 60 minutes at a given temperature (75°C; 85°C or 93°C
in this thesis). After 60 min, the pH was adjusted to a given value and a sample was taken
to assure the pH was stable at 25°C.
This was followed by the radical polymerization with monomers and an initiator to initiate the
polymerization, here Initiator 1, explained in Figure 3.1 as (5) and (6), where the pump was
feeding the monomers and initiator to the reactor at constant rate. The feeding time was 120
min and stirring rate was 200 rpm (4).
A sample was taken after 120 min (referred to as S1) through the valve at the bottom of the
reactor, (8). The same properties as the target properties, mentioned in Table 1.1 in Chapter
1.1, were analyzed. If the solids content was below the theoretical solids content of the recipe,
approximately 25%, a second feed of initiator was added, at the same rate and concentration
as before. The second feed of initiator was on until the solids content met the criteria of 25%,
but not longer than 120 min. When the targeted solids content was achieved, in other words,
the polymerization was presumably completed, a further mixing of 45 min at constant
temperature was done to finalize the polymerization and to minimize the extent of residual
monomers.

17

Isabella Laurén

The reactor and dispersion cooled down to room temperature. The pH was adjusted to
approximately 4.5, whereupon the dispersion was filtered through a 100 µm filter and, if
necessary, diluted if the solids content was too high. The dispersions were stored at room
temperature in glass bottles. The polymerization process steps are also found in Appendix
A.
The polymerization time was in total a maximum of 225 min + max.120 min + cooling time,
where the 120 min feed was depending on the solids content of S1. If Initiator 3 was added
to the polymerization, another 60 min of stirring was added.

3.2.2 Variations in the recipe
Variations in the recipe and the polymerization process were done, to achieve better results
and to investigate impacting factors.

pH
Different factors were investigated, such as, pH. The pH during polymerization was adjusted
between 1.8 and 7.0, to investigate the impact of the pH on the polymerization rate and the
properties of the dispersion. All polymerizations were made with the standard recipe,
described in Chapter 3.2.1, and with Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1, at 85°C. The polymerizations
are listed in Table 3.1. The pH mentioned was maintained during polymerization, the final
dispersion was always adjusted to approximately 4.5. The polymerization at pH 5.0 was
repeated.

process at pH 6.0. If Initiator 3 was added, an additional mixing of 60 min was necessary. A

dispersion polymerized at pH 5.0. The polymerizations were done using Stabilizer 2 and

In all polymerizations, Initiator 1 was used as initiator, apart from two polymerizations, see

due to shortage of time. The polymerization was stabilized by Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 2, at
85°C.

3.3 Determinations and analyses
3.3.1 pH and viscosity
The pH was measured with Knick Portamess 911 pH Meter, and the viscosity (η) with
Brookfield Ametek Dv1 Digital Viscometer. Brookfield viscosity was measured with spindle
18 and at 60 rpm if nothing else is stated.

3.3.2 Solids content
The solids content (SC) was analyzed by Mettler Toledo – Halogen moisture analyzer HR73.
Approximately 3 g of the dispersion was needed for one measurement.

3.3.3 Particle size distribution
The particle size distribution (PSD) and average particle size (D50 and D90) were measured
by Malvern Zetasizer Nano, where light scattering is used to measure the distribution. One
drop of the dispersion was diluted in 1 ml H2O, in some cases the ratio was increased to
either two drops in 1 ml H2O or one drop diluted in 2 ml H2O, depending on the mean count
rate that should be between 200 and 500 kcps, according to the instructions. The device can
measure particles between approximately 1 nm to 6 µm.

3.3.4 Molar mass and molar mass distribution
The molar mass and the molar mass distribution were determined by SEC Agilent 1100
series with RI detector, a method separating molecules according to their size and molar
mass, or more correctly, their hydrodynamic volume (Stevens Creek, 2015). The samples
were freeze-dried and dissolved in an eluent (DMF + 5 g/l LiCl) before the analysis.

3.3.5 Residual monomers
Residual monomers were analyzed by HPLC Agilent 1200 Series Infinity II LC Systems.
HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography, is an analysis method used to identify and
quantify individual molecules in a mixture (Stevens Creek, 2014). A few dispersions were
analyzed by HPLC to identify and quantify residual monomers, to adjust the following

22

Isabella Laurén

polymerizations by enhancing the polymerization rate to minimize the amount of residual
monomers.

3.3.6 Zeta potential
One important property of the dispersion was its stability, and the ability to remain stable
over time. The determination of ζ-potential was measured by Malvern Zetasizer Nano. The
pH of the suspension was adjusted between 2.0 and 8.0, to investigate at what pH the
dispersion was stable. The explanations of the generated values of the ζ-potential are found
in Table 3.8.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The target of this thesis was to identify and adjust impacting factors of the polymerization
and to reach approximately the same results concerning properties as the dispersions
stabilized with an already known polysaccharide. One important aspect was to identify the
correlation between various factors that affected the polymerization and optimize the factors
to improve the polymerization reaction. Different recipes and polymerization conditions were
tested to obtain optimal properties of the dispersions.
Properties such as solids content and pH were adjusted to reach the target, whereas particle
size was depending on the conditions during polymerization. The target properties are found
in Table 4.1, and are described in Chapter 1.1.

Polymerizations were generally not repeated due to shortage of time, but to receive more
reliable data, polymerizations should be done at least three times. Considering this, the
achieved data might be to some extent deceptive. Some polymerizations were repeated due
to deviant essential results. All polymerizations were initiated by Initiator 1 unless something
else is stated.

4.1 Polymerization with Stabilizer 1
As a reference, a polymerization using Stabilizer 1 was performed. The use of Stabilizer 1
has been investigated earlier and the dispersion showed good properties, hence the use as
a reference dispersion in this thesis work. This stabilizer was commonly used in nanoparticle
dispersions, since the stabilizer was grafted to the monomers and created small particles

24

(Pei, et al., 2016). The achieved properties of the dispersion are found in Table 4.2, and all
properties were within the target (Table 4.1).

The polymerization was executed according to the recipe described in Chapter 3.2.1, apart
from an addition of a pretreatment with a solution of 8 wt.% of Initiator 1, that was added to
the reactor before the monomer feed.

4.2 Polymerizations with Stabilizer 2 at different pH
All polymerizations were accomplished using the same standard recipe, using Stabilizer 2
and Initiator 1, with only variations in pH. In Figure 4.1, the solids content of the dispersion
after 120 min of polymerization, S1, and the final dispersion are shown at different pH,
compared to the amount of additional initiator.

Figure 4.1 Solids content and additional amount of initiator in dispersions polymerized with
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1, at 85°C and different pH.
Increasing the pH above 1.8, increased the solids content of S1, meaning that the monomers
did not polymerize completely at lower pH (Figure 4.1). Due to this, the initiator feed was
continued at the same rate to increase the solids content, after the monomer feed was
completed. The highest solids content after 120 min of polymerization, about 24%, was
achieved at pH 6.0, as S1 in Figure 4.1. This indicates the polymerization process was
presumably successful, since, in these polymerizations, lower solids content indicates an
unfinalized polymerization (Reed & Alb, 2014). Polymerizations were not executed at higher
pH than 7.0 since the monomers were starting to hydrolyze at higher pH. If the solids content
was high, above approximately 29%, water was added to dilute the final dispersion.

Figure 4.1. The target was to obtain dispersions with a viscosity below 200 mPas, which
making the highest obtained viscosity at approximately 22 mPas at pH 5.0 considerably
under the limit (Figure 4.2). Only small differences in viscosity were seen for dispersions
from different polymerizations; the maximum scale was 25 mPas.

Figure 4.3 D90 and D50 particle size in dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and Initiator
1, at 85°C and different pH. The final D90 value at pH 1.8 was 4 380 nm.
The average particle size did not change remarkably when comparing polymerizations at pH
2.8 to 7.0. However, as seen in Figure 4.3, the average particle size was very large at pH
1.8. The particle size D50 of the final dispersion was at its smallest at pH 6.0, about 220 nm,
along with practically no variations in particle size D90 between pH 3.8 and 6.0. The particle
sizes (D50 and D90) were larger than the target values (Table 4.1). Considering this, further
polymerizations were attained at pH 5.0 and 6.0 while changing other factors, to obtain a
smaller particle size.
As seen in Figure 4.4, the PSD was significantly broader for S1 in dispersions made at pH
2.3, compared to those made at pH 6.0. In the final dispersion, there was a second peak in
the dispersion polymerized at pH 2.3, indicating that the dispersion did contain a small
number of very large particles. Since the PSD was weighted by volume, even a small amount
of larger particles would skew the distribution graph. PSD graphs from all polymerizations
are found in Appendix F.

All dispersions contained residual monomers (Figure 4.5), which means the polymerization
was not completed even though the solids content was between 25 and 30%. The sample
marked as “pH 6.0a” was taken immediately after the solids content of the dispersion was
higher than 25% (after 195 min), whereas the dispersion labeled as “pH 6.0b” was the final
dispersion after a full polymerization time (300 min). The reference dispersion polymerized
with Stabilizer 1 contained 0 mg monomers/kg (results not shown).

taken after the solids content was higher than 25% and a mixing time of 45 min (a total time
of 195 min), while the sample “pH 6.0b” was taken after a fulltime polymerization (a total time
of ca. 300 min). Substance B was a by-product from Monomers 2 and 3.
The dispersion polymerized at pH 2.3 contained the smallest amount of residual monomers,
since the polymerization had the longest additional feeding time of the initiator, to reach the
solids content of 25%. Furthermore, the dispersion that had a fulltime polymerization at pH
6.0 (pH 6.0b) contained less monomers compared to the sample taken earlier in the same
polymerization process (pH 6.0a). All presumably successful dispersions, i.e. had a solids
content of approximately 25%, had a dark color and did not show evidence of phase
separation, see Figure 4.6.

Considering the results in this chapter, the dispersions polymerized at pH 5.0 and 6.0
generated the best average results when comparing the results from polymerizations done
at different pH to the target properties listed in Table in Chapter 4. Furthermore, the PSD
was narrower in polymerizations executed at pH 5.0 and 6.0, compared to polymerizations
at lower pH values. The polymerization was possibly hindered by impurities in the stabilizer
since it is a bio-based compound. Also, phenolic groups or inorganic salts can slow down
the polymerization reaction, making the additional feed of initiator necessary to reach the
final solids content and complete the polymerization of the monomers. Phenolic groups have
radical scavenging effects and, since the polymerization was a radical polymerization
process, the phenolic compounds might interact with the radicals formed by the initiator and

4.3 Polymerizations at pH 5.0 with Stabilizer 2 and with modified
recipe
Polymerizations executed at pH 5.0 with varying temperature, amount of stabilizer and
initiator, and feeding rate of initiator are investigated in this chapter. All dispersions were
stabilized by Stabilizer 2 and initiated by Initiator 1.

4.3.1 Polymerizations at 85°C and pH 5.0 with added stabilizer and different
monomer feed
Four polymerizations at pH 5.0 and 85°C were executed with Stabilizer 2, as polymerization
at this pH gave one of the most promising results declared in Chapter 4.2. Apart from the
dispersion polymerized at pH 5.0, two dispersions containing approximately 20% and 40%
more stabilizer and one dispersion with different feeding rates of initiator and monomers,
were executed. The modified feeding rate was executed as following: during the first 15
minutes of the polymerization, 1/3 of the initiator and monomers were added to the reactor
at a constant rate. For the following 120 min, the other 2/3 of the amount were added to the
reactor at constant rate. This gave a total time of 135 min. All other polymerizations had a
feeding time of 120 min, with constant rate.
As observed in Figure 4.7, the dispersion polymerized at different feeding rates generated
the highest solids content for the S1 sample. The polymerization rate was faster if there was
a larger amount of initiator in the reactor when the monomers started to polymerize,
considering the radical polymerization process (Braun, 2009).

Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1, at 85°C and pH 5.0 containing 0%, 20% and 40% more stabilizer,
and with different feeding rates of the initiator.
When more stabilizer was added to the reaction, the theoretical solids content was calculated
to approximately 22%. The dispersion containing 40% more stabilizer contained also 35%
more water, resulting in a more diluted dispersion and lower solids content. There was no
second feed of initiator added to the dispersion polymerized with different feeding rates. In
afterthought, a second feed of initiator could have been added to achieve higher solids
content than 21.5%.
Concerning the viscosity, no considerable variations were detected (Figure 4.8). The narrow
variations can be equally well explained by differences in repeating experiments since the
difference was only approximately 13 mPas. With increasing amount of stabilizer, the amount
of water increased proportionally. This lowered the calculated solids content of the dispersion
to 22% and made it slightly more diluted, which lowered the viscosity.

initiator. The Brookfield viscosity was measured with spindle 18 at 60 rpm.
The particle size decreased when the amount of stabilizer increased, seen in Figure 4.9.
Presumably, more stabilizer inhibited the molecules from agglomeration to some extent.
Feeding the initiator and monomers to the reactor at different rates did not have any
conspicuous impact on the particle size compared to normal feeding rates. However, the
nucleation mechanism should presumably be different at various concentrations of initiator,
making the average particle size of the dispersions different (Monteiro & de Barbeyrac, 2001).

The dispersion containing 40% more stabilizer had lower content of residual monomers in
the dispersion, as seen in Figure 4.10, presumably since the polymerization time was longer
to reach the theoretical solids content of the dispersion, compared to the polymerization
executed with the original amount of stabilizer.

a by-product from Monomers 2 and 3.
However, the dispersion containing 40% more stabilizer was more diluted than the other
dispersion, making the ratio of monomers compared to the other components lower.

4.3.2 Polymerizations at pH 5.0 and different temperatures
Polymerizations were also performed at 75°C, 85°C and 93°C, all at pH 5.0 with Stabilizer 2
and Initiator 1. The polymerization at 75°C was not expanded any further due to shortage of
time. However, three polymerizations were accomplished at 93°C. The first one with no extra
modifications, along with one dispersion containing 40% more initiator and one
polymerization having 20% more stabilizer.
The solids content was higher at 93°C (Figure 4.11), compared to polymerizations done at
85°C. Due to this, a second feed of initiator was not necessary, since the solids content was
high enough, almost 25%, immediately after 120 min of polymerization (S1).

with 40% more initiator and 20% more stabilizer. All dispersions were polymerized at pH 5.0.
The polymerization executed at 75°C, however, had a lower solids content after 120 min (S1)
and a second feed of initiator was necessary to meet the targeted solids content of 25%
(Figure 4.11). This showed that the polymerization rate was faster at higher temperatures,
and at lower temperature a second feed of initiator was needed to complete the
polymerization, compared to polymerizations at 85°C (Reed & Alb, 2014).
Major differences were found in the viscosity, see Figure 4.12. Due to a considerable
increase in the viscosity, the polymerizations done at 93°C with no extra additives and the
polymerization with 40% more initiator were not measurable at 60 rpm. All five dispersions
were measured at 1.5 rpm to retrieve more comparable data, seen in Table 4.3.

Considering these results, a higher temperature increased the viscosity. However, an
increase in the amount of stabilizer, and therefore also a significant addition of water to the
dispersion, lowered the viscosity. Furthermore, the increase in viscosity in the dispersion

38

Isabella Laurén

polymerized at 75°C (Figure 4.12), was presumably due to a significantly longer time of
polymerization compared to the other polymerizations, approximately 100 min longer. The
dispersion containing 40% more initiator was later diluted from a solids content to 27% to
23.5%, according to

(1)

𝑐1 𝑉1 = 𝑐2 𝑉2

where c = concentration and V = volume. The dilution noticeable decreased the viscosity, to
approximately 200 mPas at 60 rpm.
Likewise, differences in the average particle size were detected, see Figure 4.13.
Presumably, the dispersion achieved at 75°C did not polymerize properly since the S1 D50
value was only 44 nm.

initiator and 20% more stabilizer. All dispersions were polymerized at pH 5.0. The final D90
value of the dispersion containing 40% more initiator was 5 360 nm. The dispersions
polymerized at 93°C showed a very disperse nature and the measurements were somewhat
unreliable due to a too polydisperse solution for the Zetasizer, according to the instrument
instructions.

39

Isabella Laurén

The dispersion polymerized at 75°C did also contain several larger particles, increasing the
average particle size, see PSD in Appendix F. The dispersion containing 40% more initiator
generated a final D90 value of 5 360 nm, only partly observed in Figure 4.13 to make the
graph more comprehensible, indicating the dispersion contained very large particles.
As seen in Figure 4.14, the dispersion containing 40% more initiator and polymerized with
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1 at 93°C had three peaks instead of one, indicating the dispersions
contained aggregated particles, making the PSD broad. Especially in the distribution of the
dispersion containing 40% more initiator, the peaks were sharp, which indicates a small
number of very large particles.

Furthermore, three distinct populations indicates the average size was hard to calculate,
demonstrating that the dispersion polymerized at 93°C with 40% more initiator has somewhat

Isabella Laurén

unreliable average particle size, found in Figure 4.13. The PSD measurements of these two
dispersions declared in Figure 4.14 did not meet the desired criteria of dispersity to correctly
analyze the distribution according to the instrument instructions, meaning the data might be
slightly unreliable.
The dispersions polymerized at 75°C and 93°C were more brown in color, compared to the
dispersion polymerized at 85°C (Figure 4.15). At higher temperature, the dispersions were
more unstable and showed clear phase separation, presumably due to ineffectiveness of the
stabilizer at higher temperatures and formation of agglomerated particles.

Figure 4.15 Dispersions polymerized at 75°C (left), 85°C (middle) and 93°C (right), with
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1 at pH 5.0. A noticeable three-phase separation was observed in
the dispersion polymerized at 93°C, i.e., the dispersion was unstable. Photo: Private.
In conclusion, the monomers polymerized faster at higher temperature, and minimized the
demand of a second feed of initiator. However, at higher temperature, the dispersions were
seemingly more unstable, due to the visible phase separations and broader PSD, and the
stabilizer was not working properly. By increasing the amount of initiator, the reaction rate
increased significantly and the particles started to agglomerate and the PSD became very
broad (Monteiro & de Barbeyrac, 2001).
However, at lower temperature, the polymerization was slower, and more time and initiator
were needed to complete the polymerization. Presumably, the particles started to
agglomerate in the end of the reaction process, generating large particles. To get more
accurate statistics and to explain the major differences between the dispersions, the

41

Isabella Laurén

polymerizations should be repeated considering the measured data can be somewhat
unreliable.

4.4 Polymerizations with different additives
Dispersions containing an addition of Initiator 3, Substance A, and 20% more stabilizer, are
investigated in this chapter. All dispersions were polymerized at pH 6.0 and 85°C with
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1.

4.4.1 Polymerizations at pH 6.0
The dispersion with the properties closest to the target properties using Stabilizer 2 and
Initiator 1 was obtained at pH 6, as described in Chapter 4.2. Therefore, four more
dispersions were polymerized at this pH. A polymerization containing 20% more stabilizer
was executed but due to a misleading pH meter, the pH during polymerization was adjusted
to 6.3 instead of 6.0. The differences are presumably negligible and not taken into
consideration. To increase the rate of polymerization and minimize the amount of excessive
residual monomers, Initiator 3 was added to one dispersion, after the polymerization reaction.
To another dispersion a chain-transfer agent, Substance A, was added to the monomer feed.
Finally, a dispersion containing both Initiator 3 and Substance A was polymerized. The
addition of Initiator 3 was 0.1 g/ 100 g dispersion and Substance A was 0.3 g/ 100 g
dispersion.
As shown in Figure 4.16, only small varieties in the solids content were detected. The
dispersion containing no extra compounds had the highest solids content after 120 min (S1),
making the amount of additional initiator needed the smallest. The other dispersions were
somewhat similar concerning the solids content in S1, with minor differences in the amount
of added initiator.

20% more stabilizer; addition of Substance A; addition of Initiator 3; and a dispersion
containing both Substance A and Initiator 3.
Initiator 3 was added after S1 was taken. However, the two dispersions containing Initiator 3
did significantly increase in the solids content of the final dispersion. This indicates that
residual monomers were found in S1 and the polymerization continued to some extent after
the addition of Initiator 3. Taken into consideration, the dispersions containing Initiator 3 had
an additional mixing at 85°C during 60 min for the monomers to polymerize further. The
solids content of the dispersions containing Initiator 3 were later diluted according to
Equation (1) to approximately 25%.
The viscosities were low, differences were detected in the dispersions containing Substance
A, where the viscosity was slightly higher, see Figure 4.17. Presumably, the addition of
Substance A changed the structure of the polymer chain, and increased the viscosity due to,
e.g., branches and entanglements (Valles & Macosko, 1979). Nevertheless, the differences
were small and all values were within the target of < 200 mPas.

addition of Substance A increased the final D90 of the dispersion, especially when combined
with Initiator 3. This was the opposite found in research done by Monteiro & de Barbeyrac
(2001), were the particle size decreased with increasing concentration of a chain-transfer
agent and initiator.

stabilizer; addition of Substance A; addition of Initiator 3; and a dispersion containing both
Substance A and Initiator 3. The final D90 value of the dispersion containing both Substance
A and Initiator 3 was 4 600 nm.

As displayed in Figure 4.18, the average particle size of S1 in the dispersion containing
Initiator 3 was larger than the average particle size of the final dispersion, since Initiator 3
was added to the polymerization after S1 was taken. With this taken into consideration, the
S1 sample of the dispersion polymerized without any extra additives should be similar to the
S1 of the dispersion containing Initiator 3, since they have the exact same polymerization
conditions, but significant differences were noticed. To receive more reliable data, these
polymerizations should be repeated, considering the results should be comparable.
As mentioned, the addition of Substance A seemed to increase the value of D90, and in the
dispersion containing both Substance A and Initiator 3, the final D90 value was
approximately 4 600 nm. The difference can be explained by the results from the PSD in
Figure 4.19, where two populations in the final dispersion can be seen, the second population
was above 1 000 nm.

dispersion showed a very disperse nature and the measurement was somewhat unreliable
due to a too polydisperse solution for the Zetasizer, according to the instrument instructions.
The red curve shows the PSD of the final dispersion and the green curve shows the PSD of
the S1 sample.
The PSD results of the dispersion containing both Substance A and Initiator 3 contained
larger aggregates or particles, and was too polydisperse to retrieve correct data, therefore
these results might be slightly unreliable (Figure 4.18 and 4.19). According to similar radical
polymerizations with the addition of a chain-transfer agent, the dispersity of the PSD
increased when the agent was added to the reaction process (Ahmad & Tauer, 2003). The
addition of a chain-transfer agent effects the rate of particle nucleation, leading to fewer
nucleated particles. This would result in a broader PSD and larger particles (Smeets, et al.,
2010).
Furthermore, the molar mass was larger in dispersions with no addition of Initiator 3 and
Substance A, as seen in Figure 4.20. According to Schmidt et al. (2017), these molar mass
values are typical for these kinds of emulsion polymerizations and lead to an average particle
size of 300 – 400 nm.

4.4.2 Polymerizations at pH 3.8 and 6.0 with additives
Considering the results in the previous chapter, the addition of Substance A did not work
particularly well at pH 6.0. Hence, a similar polymerization at pH 3.8 were executed, to
compare the addition of Substance A and Initiator 3 at pH 3.8 and 6.0, polymerized with
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1 at 85°C. The solids content of S1 and the final dispersion are seen

approximately 25%, according to Equation (1). Also, the viscosity was lower at pH 3.8 (Figure
4.22). In other words, the polymerization rate was slower at lower pH, but the final dispersion
had roughly the same results concerning solids content and viscosity, as stated in Chapter
4.2. However, the viscosity of both dispersions was low and under the limit of the target
viscosity, 200 mPas.

was noticeable higher, as seen in Figure 4.23, but not as high as the same value of the

Isabella Laurén

The average particle size of dispersions containing Substance A and Initiator 3 was high and
the dispersions contained larger particles (see PSD graphs in Appendix F). As mentioned in
the end of Chapter 4.4.1, variations in the nucleation process due to the chain-transfer agent
can generate larger particles, especially over time (Smeets, et al., 2010). This fact correlates
to the data seen in Figure 4.23, where S1 has significantly lower particle size D90, compared
to the values of the final dispersion.
The addition of the chain-transfer agent, Substance A, made the dispersion more dispersed
and it contained some larger particles. Considering the particle size and PSD, the additives
worked better at pH 3.8 compared to pH 6.0. Hence, the dispersion polymerized at pH 3.8
was analyzed for residual monomers (Figure 4.24).

contained amounts as large as 24 000 mg/kg. However, as predicted, the dispersion
containing Substance A and Initiator 3 had significantly lower amounts of residual monomers.
Initiator 3 continued the polymerization after the solids content was reached, lowering the
amount of unpolymerized monomers.

4.5 Other polymerizations
Dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and another initiator, Initiator 2, are clarified and
discussed. Further, polymerizations stabilized by Stabilizer 3 and Initiator 1 are discussed.

4.5.1 Polymerizations with Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 2
Two dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 2 were executed. These
dispersions were accomplished at 85°C and at pH 2.3 and 5.5, according to the standard
recipe. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 instead of 5.0 due to a misleading pH meter. Due to
shortage of time, these polymerizations were not further investigated. The additional feed of
initiator was also Initiator 2.
As seen in Figure 4.25, the solids content at pH 2.3 and 5.5 were similar, both in S1 and in
the final dispersion. The additional feed of Initiator 2 was on for approximately 120 min in
both polymerizations, with no increase in the solids content. The theoretical solids content

Since the initiator contained larger amounts of water, the additional feed of initiator diluted

content. Hence, the solids content did not increase by the addition of a second feed of initiator.
According to these results, Initiator 2 did not initiate the polymerization process as efficient
as Initiator 1, since the solids content did not increase (compared to Figure 4.1 in Chapter
4.2).
Same tendencies can be seen in the viscosity, the more diluted dispersion caused by a more
diluted Initiator 2 resulted in a lower viscosity. As observed in Figure 4.26, the viscosity of
both S1 and final dispersion was exceptionally low, all under 4 mPas. Presumably, since the
product contained approximately 10% more water compared to the dispersions initiated by
Initiator 1, the viscosity was significantly lower for the dispersions polymerized with Initiator
2.

Observing the average particle size (Figure 4.27), neither polymerizations were successful

very broad (Figure 4.28). S1 varied from under 10 nm to almost 1 000 nm, whereas the final
dispersion had smaller indications at 50 nm and 7 000 nm.

Figure 4.28 Particle size distribution by volume, in a dispersion polymerized with Stabilizer
2 and Initiator 2, at 85°C and pH 2.3. The dispersion showed a very disperse nature and the
measurement was slightly unreliable due to a too polydisperse solution for the Zetasizer,
according to the instrument instructions. The red curve shows the PSD of the final dispersion
and the green curve shows the PSD of the S1 sample.
However, the particle size was too polydisperse to achieve reliable information, therefore,
the data explained in Figure 4.27 are questionable. The final dispersions showed clear phase
separations, as seen in Figure 4.29, indicating in an presumably unfinalized polymerization
containing agglomerated particles.

Since these two dispersions did not polymerize successfully, further experiments using
Initiator 2 were not done in this thesis work, due to shortage of time and to limit the impacting
factors in the polymerization process.

4.5.2 Polymerizations with Stabilizer 3
Stabilizer 3 consisted of one of the two main components in Stabilizer 2, the lignin-based
polyelectrolyte, so four polymerizations using Stabilizer 3 and Initiator 1 were executed. One
polymerization was executed at pH 2.3 and three polymerizations at pH 5.0: one without any
additions, along with one polymerization with the addition of Substance A and Initiator 3, and
one with 40% more stabilizer. All dispersions were polymerized by Stabilizer 3 and Initiator
1 at 85°C. Stabilizer 3 was a powder, compared to Stabilizer 2 that was in liquid form. This
acquired different ratio stabilizer-to-water to meet the theoretical solids content of
approximately 25%.
Similar to Stabilizer 2, polymerizations with Stabilizer 3 reached higher solids content for the
final dispersion at neutral pH (Figure 4.30). The pH of Stabilizer 3 dissolved in water was 8.3,
when the similar pH value of Stabilizer 2 was approximately 5.0. As shown in Figure 4.30,
the polymerization was not successful at lower pH, as the solids content of the final

54

Isabella Laurén

dispersion was below 10%. The additional feed of initiator did not increase the solids content
in S1 at pH 2.3, indicating the stabilizer inhibits or slow down the polymerization at low pH.

polymerized at pH 5.0 with no additions; the addition of Substance A and Initiator 3; and 40%
more stabilizer.
As seen in Figure 4.30, at pH 5.0, the solids content increased after a 240 min polymerization
time (a full polymerization time + 120 min of additional feed of initiator). Furthermore, the
addition of Substance A and Initiator 3 did not increase the solids content in dispersion
polymerized with Stabilizer 3 as much as in dispersions stabilized by Stabilizer 2 (Figure 4.16
in Chapter 4.4.1), the solids content was almost 10% lower. An increase in the amount of
stabilizer did only increase the solids content slightly. Considering this, Stabilizer 3 needed
significantly longer polymerization time, compared to polymerizations done with Stabilizer 2.
As noticed in Figure 4.31, the viscosity was very low at lower pH, presumably due to the low
solids content. At pH 5.0, the viscosity increased when the chain-transfer agent (Substance
A) was added to the reaction. Similar results have been showed earlier (Valles & Macosko,
1979). Furthermore, the viscosity increased significantly after an addition of 40% more
stabilizer. However, this data was contradictory to the viscosifying properties of the stabilizer
(Yang, et al., 2007).

In contrast to the particle sizes in dispersions polymerizations with Stabilizer 2, the average
size was substantially larger in the dispersion stabilized by Stabilizer 3 (Figure 4.32),
indicating the stabilizer did not hinder the particles from agglomeration.

The final D90 values of the three dispersions polymerized at pH 5.0 from left to right:
4 900 nm; 3 300 nm; 5 100 nm.
As seen in Figure 4.32, the particle size of S1 in all three dispersions executed at pH 5.0
were relatively low. Considering the low solids content of the dispersions, of approximately
10%, the polymerization was not successful during the first 120 min of the polymerization
and the dispersion was presumably containing large amounts of unpolymerized monomers
(Reed & Alb, 2014). At pH 2.3, a remarkable observation about the D50 values is seen in
Figure 4.32, where the value of S1 was greater than the value of the final dispersion. This is
explained in Figure 4.33, where the final dispersion at pH 2.3 has a peak at very low particle
size, indicating the dispersion was containing small particles.

At pH 2.3, the dispersion showed clear phase separations (Figure 4.34) and was considered
unstable. At pH 5.0 with additional amounts of stabilizer, the polymerizations were more
successful, and no phase separations were observed.

the dispersion polymerized at pH 2.3 (left). Photo: Private.
However, the dispersions stabilized by Stabilizer 3 were not stable over time. After three to
four weeks of storage, the dispersions showed signs of sedimentation and a thick layer was
created on the bottom of the bottle, in comparison to the more stable dispersions polymerized
by Stabilizer 2.
In conclusion, Stabilizer 3 did not stabilize the dispersions very well on its own and was
presumably inhibited by impurities or inorganic salts (Braun, 2009), and the initiator did not
polymerize the monomers sufficiently enough.

4.6 Particle stability and zeta potential
An important factor of the dispersion was the long-term stability. Visual observations can
immediately detected if the dispersion did not polymerize or if the stabilizer did not stabilize
properly, see number 1 and 3 in Figure 4.35, where distinct phase separations are seen.

Usually, the dispersions separated into layers had a lower solids content than the theoretical
solids content. In Figure 4.35, a notable color variation among the dispersions are shown.
The dispersions that have had a more successful polymerization and therefore are
considered stable, had a lighter color nuance. Color variations were not a part of the research
plan in this work; therefore, the variations were not investigated any further.

4.6.1 Particle stability
No significant decrease over time in average particle size was detected for a selected
number of dispersions that were investigated, seen in Figure 4.36, where the original particle
size was compared to the particle size measured after storage. The dispersions were stored
in closed glass bottles in darkness and at room temperature from 11 to 16 weeks, depending
on the time of polymerization.

dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 at pH 3.8; 5.0 and 6.0. All dispersions were initiated
by Initiator 1 at 85°C.
Smaller differences can be detected, presumably due to variations in repeating
measurements. Considering this, the molecules did not degrade over this specific timeframe,
making the dispersions stable over this period. Furthermore, no sign of sedimentation, due
to agglomeration of the particles, was detected.

4.6.2 ζ-potential
The ζ-potential was measured to investigate colloidal stability of the dispersions, see Figure
4.37. The measurements were determined at 22°C, where the pH was adjusted between 2.0
and 8.0.

Figure 4.37 ζ-potential at different pH in dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 1 at pH 2.3;
with Stabilizer 2 at pH 3.8 and 5.0; and with Stabilizer 3 at pH 5.0. All polymerizations were
initiated by Initiator 1 at 85°C. The explanations of ζ-potential values are clarified in Table
3.8 in Chapter 3.3, where the dispersion was considered unstable at 0 ± 30 mV.
The values of pH were chosen according the potential pH range in the area of application for
the product. Explanation to different values of ζ-potential was clarified in Table 3.8 in Chapter
3.3: the closer to 0 mV, the more unstable the dispersion was (or more sterically stabilized).
As seen in Figure 4.37, polymerizations done with Stabilizer 1 gave ζ-potential values closer
to zero, than dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 or 3. This indicated that the dispersion
had lower electrostatic stabilization (Ishikawa, et al., 2005).
Due to poor distribution data, it was not possible to achieve reliable data for measurements
done at higher pH. Considering earlier explained data of average particle size and solids
content, the dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1 at pH 5.0 generated the
best average results, compared to the target properties. Further, the ζ-potential was low in
the dispersion polymerized at pH 5.0, indicating in good colloidal stability (Ishikawa, et al.,
2005).

4.7 Comparison of stabilizers
The differences between the polymerizations executed at pH 5.0 and 6.0, stabilized by
Stabilizer 2 and Initiator 1, were small, and according to this research, the best average
results concerning target properties were generated at these pH values. Moreover, with an
addition of 40% more stabilizer, the properties improved further. Stabilizer 3 did not stabilize
the dispersion as efficient as Stabilizer 2. However, compared to the reference
polymerization with Stabilizer 1 and Initiator 1 polymerized at pH 2.3, the differences were
big between the three stabilizers. The polymerization time was longer for the dispersions
stabilized by Stabilizer 2 and 3, with the addition of one hour to the polymerization with
Stabilizer 2, respectively two hours with Stabilizer 3, compared to the polymerization time of
the dispersions stabilized by Stabilizer 1. All polymerizations discussed in this chapter were
executed at 85°C and with Initiator 1.
An additional feed of initiator was added to the polymerizations with Stabilizer 2 and 3, while
the reference polymerization with Stabilizer 1 achieved the targeted solids content
immediately after the end of the monomer feed, hence no S1 of the dispersion stabilized by
Stabilizer 1 (Figure 4.38).

% more stabilizer. All polymerizations were initiated by Initiator 1 at 85°C. The dispersion
polymerized with Stabilizer 3 had a final D90 value of 5 080 nm and D50 value of 425 nm.
The average particle size values of the polymerizations accomplished at pH 5.0 with
Stabilizer 2 were significantly higher compared to the polymerization executed with Stabilizer
1, but no confounding results were generated. The dispersion stabilized by Stabilizer 3
contained large particles and the distribution was broad, as explained in Chapter 4.5.2,
indicating the stabilizer did not stabilize the particles properly or the initiator was not sufficient
enough (Braun, 2009).
The dispersions stabilized by Stabilizer 1 and 2 had narrow particle size distributions, graphs
found in Appendix F, with no second peaks, indicating no larger particles were found in these
dispersions. As seen in Figure 4.40, the molar mass of the dispersion polymerized with
Stabilizer 1 was lower compared to the molar masses in dispersions polymerized with
Stabilizer 2 and 3. Furthermore, this explains the larger average particle sizes for the
dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and 3 (Schmidt, et al., 2017).

of initiator in the dispersion polymerized with Stabilizer 3, a more diluted dispersion due to
more water in the reaction, and longer polymerization time.

5 CONCLUSION
Bio-based and bio-degradable products are constantly developed, and non-renewable
material are replaced by bio-friendly components to reduce the impact on the environment.
Bio-based stabilizers are found in most plants and protect the plant from, e.g., UV-radiation,
fungi and bacteria. Many bio-based polymers, such as cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose,
are widely used in the industry today as stabilizers and emulsifiers, among other things. In
this thesis, different natural polymers and their potential as stabilizers in mainly latex
dispersions were discussed. The focus in this work was on the colloidal stability of a
dispersion, i.e., how the stabilizer prevents the aggregation of particles in a dispersion.
Furthermore, polymerizations stabilized with two different stabilizers were executed, and the
dispersions were analyzed and compared to a reference dispersion. Factors such as pH,
temperature and amount of stabilizer have been investigated and discussed.
A reference dispersion with Stabilizer 1, a polysaccharide, was polymerized and the aim of
this thesis was to achieve similar properties with Stabilizer 2 (polysaccharides combined with
a lignin-based polyelectrolyte) and Stabilizer 3 (consisting of the lignin-based polyelectrolyte
in Stabilizer 2). The chemical structure of the stabilizers was quite complex, and the chemical
composition of the impurities inhibited the polymerization to some extent, which necessitated
a second feed of initiator to successfully complete the polymerization.
The polymerization rate was affected by the pH during polymerization using Stabilizer 2 and
Initiator 1 at 85°C. Additional feeds of initiator were needed to finalize the polymerizations,
indicating the stabilizer might hinder or slow down the polymerization at lower pH.
Considering the target properties, better results were generated at more neutral pH, between
5.0 and 6.0. Here, the particle size distribution (PSD) was narrower, and the dispersion did
not contain larger aggregates. At lower pH, the solids content was lower, and the PSD was
wider. These dispersions often contained a small number of very large particles.
Keeping the pH constant at 5.0 while changing the temperature made the PSD very broad.
At 93°C, the dispersions contained small amounts of very large particles, while at 75°C, the
dispersion did not contain significantly larger particles. The rate of polymerization was higher
at 93°C, compared to polymerizations done at 85°C and 75°C, and there was no need of an
additional initiator to reach the solids content target. However, at higher temperature, the
dispersions were unstable and visual phase separations were observed.

66

Isabella Laurén

Additional amounts of stabilizer, both 20% and 40% more, made the PSD narrower.
Polymerizations having 20% more stabilizers were done both at pH 5.0 and 6.0 at 85°C, with
slightly lower D50 and D90 values in the dispersion polymerized at pH 5.0. The dispersions
containing 40% more stabilizer, polymerized at 85°C and pH 5.0, had the lowest particle size
of all successful polymerizations, with a D90 value of 217 nm and D50 of 118 nm, considering
the target values of D90 < 200 nm and D50 < 100 nm.
The relatively large amount of residual monomers in the dispersions was a disadvantage.
The dispersions cannot contain any hazardous substances due to their further area of
applications in surface sizing. The reference dispersion polymerized with Stabilizer 1 did not
contain any residual monomers. To reduce the amount of monomer residues, an additional
initiator, named Initiator 3, was added to the polymerization after the theoretical solids
content was achieved. This improved the rate of polymerization and significantly reduced the
amount of monomer leftovers. However, the dispersion still contained approximately 5 000
mg monomers/kg dispersion, in comparison to almost 25 000 mg/kg for a dispersion that did
not contain Initiator 3. Furthermore, dispersions polymerized at lower pH had lower amounts
of residues, due to the additional amount of initiator to meet the solids content of 25% and a
more diluted dispersion.
Since Stabilizer 2 consisted of two main compounds, a few dispersions stabilized with only
one of the compounds were done. This stabilizer, Stabilizer 3, was more alkaline than
Stabilizer 2, with a pH of 8.3 compared to 5.0, and as polymerizations done with Stabilizer 2,
these polymerizations worked better at more neutral pH at 85°C. However, the dispersions
had a very broad PSD, and all samples contained small amounts of very large particles. The
dispersion polymerized at pH 5.0 with Stabilizer 3 contained residual monomers as well.
After weeks of storage, the dispersions started to show signs of sedimentation, indicating
the dispersions were not stable over time.
The dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2 and 3 at pH 5.0 showed negative ζ-potential,
between -40 to -52 mV. The ζ-potential was lower compared to the potential of the reference
dispersion polymerized with Stabilizer 1, where the further from 0 mV the better colloidal
stability. Furthermore, no degradation over time in the stability of the particle size were
detected in dispersions polymerized with Stabilizer 2. The dispersions were stored between
11 and 16 weeks before the particle size was measured again. Only smaller variations were
detected, presumably due to variations in repeating tests.

67

Isabella Laurén

Impurities found in natural stabilizers are a problem, and might hinder the polymerization to
some extent, as it presumably did in this work. However, the stabilizers showed great
potential in stabilizing nanoparticle dispersions. More experiments should be done to reduce
the amount of residual monomers and to decrease the particle size further. According to this
thesis, these bio-based stabilizers worked better at neutral pH and with a larger amount of
stabilizer and initiator compared to the amount of monomers. However, only dispersions
polymerized with Stabilizer 2 did not sediment over time, indicating these dispersions
remained stable.

6 SWEDISH SUMMARY – SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Biobaserade stabiliseringsmedel för hydrofoba nanopartikeldispersioner
Nyckelord:

Stabiliseringsmedel,

stabilitet,

dispersion,

nanopartikel,

polymerisering,

partikelstorleksfördelning, ytlimning
Intresset för förnyelsebart och bionedbrytbart material har ökat märkbart det senaste
årtiondet. Plastprodukter utvecklas ständigt och komponenter ersätts en efter en av
biobaserat material. Naturliga stabiliseringsämnen finns i de flesta växter och skyddar mot
bl.a. syre, UV-strålning, sjukdomar och kemiska angrepp. Biobaserade polymerer, såsom
cellulosa, lignin, kitosan och hemicellulosa, används i stor utsträckning inom industrin som
emulgerings-, stabiliserings- eller förtjockningsmedel. Stabiliseringsmedel är nödvändiga för
att upprätthålla produktens egenskaper och för att sakta ner eller förhindra att materialet
bryts ner, t.ex. vid syre-exponering. Fokuset i detta arbete var på dispersioners kolloidala
stabilitet, d.v.s. hur biobaserade material förhindrar agglomerering av partiklar.
De i detta arbete framställda dispersioner kommer att användas inom ytlimning (sizing) av
kartong. I ytlimningsprocessen sprids en jämn yta av en dispersion på kartongen för att täppa
igen fiber och porer på materialets yta, vilket ökar kartongens styrka och dess ytegenskaper,
bl.a. tryckegenskaper. Olika ämnen såsom alginater, cellulosa, kitosan, pektiner, och
stärkelse, har diskuterats och deras egenskaper och potential som stabiliseringsmedel har
klargjorts.
Stabiliseringsmedlet som användes i detta arbete består av vissa polysackarider kombinerat
med en ligninbaserad polyelektrolyt, kallat för Stabilizer 2. Ett antal polymeriseringar utfördes
med Stabilizer 3, som består av den ligninbaserade polyelektrolyten i Stabilizer 2. P.g.a. den
kemiska sammansättningen av orenheter i dessa stabiliseringsämnen, har polymeriseringen
av monomererna till viss mån förhindrats eller saktats ner. I och med detta hade ett extra
flöde av initiator tillsatts för att nå en torrhalt på åtminstone 25 % och för att slutföra
polymeriseringen. Faktorer såsom pH, temperatur samt mängd av stabiliseringsmedel och
initiator varierades, och dess inverkan på polymeriseringsgraden undersöktes. Egenskaper
såsom torrhalt, viskositet samt partikelstorleksfördelning (PSD) var viktiga, liksom
stabiliteten samt mängden av opolymeriserade monomerer i dispersionen. Resultaten
jämfördes med varandra och med en referensdispersion med utmärkta egenskaper, som
stabiliserades med ett från tidigare känt stabiliseringsmedel bestående av en specifik
polysackarid, Stabilizer 1. Målet var att nå liknande egenskaper med Stabilizer 2.

69

Isabella Laurén

Dispersioner polymeriserade med Stabilizer 2 vid lägre pH och med en konstant temperatur
på 85°C krävde en större mängd initiator för att slutföra polymeriseringen eftersom initiatorn
fungerade bättre vid mer neutrala förhållanden. Vid pH 5,0 och 6,0 behövdes det en mindre
mängd extra initiator för att nå en torrhalt på 25 % och dispersionerna innehöll inte stora
agglomerade partiklar. Här var partikelstorleksfördelningen relativt snäv men medelpartikelstorleken var högre än önskat.
Polymeriseringar med Stabilizer 2 vid högre temperatur (93 °C) gjorde partikelstorleksfördelningen väldigt bred. Dispersionerna innehöll en mindre mängd av väldigt stora partiklar
och viskositeten var högre jämfört med dispersioner polymeriserade vid 85 °C. Däremot
polymeriserades monomererna snabbare vid högre temperatur och ingen extra initiator
krävdes för att nå en torrhalt på 25 %. Polymeriseringarna vid högre temperatur var dock
instabila och dispersionerna var tydligt separerade i faser.
Mängden stabiliseringsmedel inverkade på partikelstorleksfördelningen. Dispersioner
innehållande 20 % och 40 % mer stabiliseringsmedel polymeriserades, både vid pH 5,0 och
6,0 vid 85°C. Dispersionen som innehöll 40 % mer stabiliseringsmedel och polymeriserades
vid pH 5,0 och 85°C gav lovande resultat med en snäv partikelstorleksfördelning och innehöll
inga stora partiklar.
Dispersionerna innehöll stora mängder monomerer efter att polymeriseringen avslutats.
Halten monomerer bör vara nära noll med tanke på dispersionernas användningsområde för
ylimning av kartong. En extra initiator, kallad Initiator 3, tillsattes i slutskedet av reaktionen
för att polymerisera de resterande monomererna och enligt vätskekromatografiska analyser
minskade mängden restmonomerer i dispersionen med nästan 80 %. Mängden monomerer
var oavsett ungefär 5000 mg monomerer/kg dispersion, vilket är för mycket för att
dispersionen ska kunna användas inom ytlimning. Dispersioner polymeriserade vid lågt pH
innehöll mindre mängd restmonomerer, troligen eftersom mer initiator krävdes för att nå en
torrhalt på 25 % samt för att dispersionen var mer utspädd. Vid högre pH nådde
dispersionerna snabbare en torrhalt på 25 % och innehöll därför en mindre mängd initiator
och vatten, och därmed en större mängd restmonomerer.
Stabiliseringsmedlet som användes i detta arbete, Stabilizer 2, bestod av två
huvudkomponenter. För att undersöka ämnet närmare utfördes ett antal polymeriseringar
stabiliserade med endast den ena komponenten, Stabilizer 3. Detta stabiliseringsmedel var
mer alkaliskt än Stabilizer 2, med ett pH på 8,3 jämfört med 5,0. Initiator tillades i större
utsträckning till reaktionen för att slutföra polymeriseringen och dispersionen innehöll en

70

märkbart mindre mängd restmonomerer jämfört med dispersioner polymeriserade under
samma villkor med Stabilizer 2. Partikelstorleksfördelning för dessa dispersioner var dock
väldigt bred och dispersionerna innehöll ett antal väldigt stora partiklar.
Dispersioner som polymeriserats med Stabilizer 2 och 3 vid pH 5,0 hade god kolloidal
stabilitet mellan pH 2,0 och 8,0 baserat på resultat från ζ-potentialmätningar. ζ-potentialen
hade ett mer negativt värde jämfört med referensdispersionen, stabiliserat med Stabilizer 1,
där ju närmare 0 mV desto lägre kolloidal stabilitet har dispersionen. I dispersioner
stabiliserade med Stabilizer 2 noterades ingen förändring av partikelstorleken efter förvaring,
denna var så gott som oförändrad efter 11 till 16 veckor av förvaring. Dispersionerna som
var stabiliserade med Stabilizer 3 sedimenterade, vilket tyder på en instabil dispersion. Alla
dispersioner förvarades i glasflaskor i rumstemperatur och i skydd från solljus.
Orenheter är ett problem i naturliga stabiliseringsmedel och kan förhindra eller sakta ner
polymeriseringsprocessen, vilket förmodligen skedde i dessa experiment. Vidare analyser
samt experiment bör göras, främst för att minska på mängden restmonomerer men även för
att minska partikelstorleken, för att dispersionerna ska kunna användas inom ytlimning.
Experimenten bör även upprepas för att få mer tillförlitligt data. Enligt detta arbete
polymeriserades dessa dispersioner bättre vid neutralt pH och med större mängder initiator
och stabiliseringsmedel.

The polymerization process was carried out according to following standard example:
1. Start the N2 flow to the reactor
2. Add water into the reactor
3. Add stabilizer to water at room temperature
4. Dissolve catalyst in water and add to the reactor. Prepare the catalyst right before
use
5. Uniform mixing at 100 rpm and heat to given temperature °C in 60 min
6. Adjust pH according to the recipe with 30% H2SO4 or 30% NaOH. Mix for 5 min and
check that pH is stable at 25°C
7. Dilute initiator in water to 3.5% solution
8. Prepare the monomer mixture1
9. Measure pH and viscosity at 25°C
10. Feed monomers and initiator to the reactor during 120 min at constant rate. Initiator
feed is started 3 min before the monomer feed
11. Measure PDS, viscosity and solids content after 120 min
12. If solids content not reached, continue the initiator feed at constant rate until the solids
content is approximately 25%, but not longer than 120 min. Measure the solids
content every 30 – 40 min 2
13. After the feed ends, mix at given temperature for 45 min
79
