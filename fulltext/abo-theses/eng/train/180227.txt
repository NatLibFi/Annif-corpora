Title: “My use of social media is not Presidential – it’s MODERN DAY
PRESIDENTIAL”: A Study on How Donald Trump Frames Mainstream Media on
Twitter
Supervisor: Martin Gill
One of Donald Trump’s most important tools as president of the U.S. is arguably the
social media platform Twitter, on which he has engaged in constant attack on what he
calls ‘Fake News’. His discourse on various news networks and media professionals
largely characterizes his years as a ‘Social Media President’. The aim of this thesis is to
study how Trump addresses various media entities and what linguistic features outline
Trump’s rhetoric in a computer-mediated context.
This research is two-fold: Study 1 deals with quantitative data on Trump’s mentions of
fourteen news networks and ten media professionals during his first two years as
president; and Study 2 comprises a detailed qualitative analysis on 82 tweets which were
selected from Study 1. All data was collected from Trump Twitter Archive, a
comprehensive compilation of Trump’s tweets. Identifying and determining the political
bias of each news network mentioned by Trump was aided by online media bias charts
Ad Fontes Media, AllSides and Media Bias/Fact Check.
The results showed that Trump overwhelmingly endorses Fox News and its journalists,
and that he is consistently critical of left-wing media outlets and their employees. While
the former is usually mentioned on its own, Trump habitually frames several left-wing
news networks in a single tweet, often under a moniker, such as Fake News or Failing.
He evidently uses a narrow vocabulary which is often based on competition, success and
money and his use of speech acts resembles that of the average Twitter user. The
qualitative tweet analysis showed that there are subtle differences in how he frames
various media professionals of the same political bias, and in some cases his attitudes
change over time.
In conclusion, Trump uses Twitter to effectively create a version of reality which in
which he can promote and praise himself as well as his supporters, and, more
importantly, where he can frame his critics as liars, fakers and frauds unconstrained by
the influence of mainstream media.

1. Introduction
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and presidency have been largely considered to
be ‘Twitter-based’. He has effectively utilized the potential of this particular social media
platform to boost his political career (Hollinger 2018), and he has arguably transformed
the meaning of ‘presidential rhetoric’. One of the key themes of Trump’s discourse on
Twitter since 2015 has been his stormy relationship with American mainstream media,
and more importantly his attacks on what he regards as the ‘Fake News Media’. As a
result, debates on political bias within media, the overall credibility of mainstream news
networks and Trump’s eccentric use of social media have greatly intensified (Allcott &
Gentzkow 2017: 212–213 & Ott 2017: 62–64). In this thesis, I will conduct a study on
Trump’s language use on Twitter in regards to news networks and media professionals to
answer the following research questions:
a. How does Donald Trump frame news networks and media professionals on
Twitter?; and
b. What linguistic elements characterize Donald Trump’s rhetoric on Twitter?
Twitter is a well-known microblog which allows users to create public profiles to share
content, consume content and socially connect on the internet with other users (Chandler
et al. 2018: 375). Its influence on American politics has grown significantly over the past
decade and a considerable part of Trump’s public rhetoric as president has taken place on
Twitter in the form of computer-mediated communication (henceforth CMC). It is
common knowledge that mainstream media and social media played a major part in
Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential election (Azari 2016: 679), and I aim to explain in
detail how he has addressed major media outlets on Twitter during his first two years as
president. This means that all data in this thesis is from the period of time between 20
January, 2017 and 20 January, 2019.
I will discuss the theoretical background of Twitter and relevant linguistic
aspects in the second chapter, after which I present the quantitative and qualitative studies
in chapters 3–4. The primary source for obtaining the tweets for my studies is Trump
Twitter Archivea (TTA), a corpus of every single tweet posted by Trump.

2. Twitter, Trump and the Revolution of American Politics
Twitter is one of the most popular social networks in the world, and its users range from
ordinary people to the most powerful and influential individuals in the world. It allows
its users to produce and publicize content in tweets, which are, as of November 2017,
limited to 280 characters (Rosen 2017). Interaction and acknowledgement on Twitter is
mainly conducted by including direct mentions of another user with the “@” symbol, by
including a hashtag, i.e. using a “#” symbol prior to a word, in a tweet, and by retweeting,
i.e. sharing public content of another user. These features naturally outline a highly
fruitful platform for discourse and linguistic input within any genre, topic and language;
they will be discussed in 2.3. My focus in this chapter will specifically be on the
characteristics of Twitter and how it has influenced American politics during the past
decade as well as how Trump has made use of Twitter as a powerful political tool.
The actual content of tweets can be categorized into specific types of
discourses, stretching from ordinary and trivial to conversational and self-promoting.
Ordinary discourse is usually associated with everyday-tweeters, while self-promotion is
often used by celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Interestingly enough, the affordances
of Twitter allows for a type of alteration in regards to these attributes. The evolution of
political rhetoric in the last decade has been peculiar due to the presence of social media.
Presidential candidates – and at the moment, the incumbent president – have
progressively altered their means of communicating to the public by not only extending
their commercials into social media platforms, but by engaging in a pedestrian-style
discourse on social media in order to reach out to followers more effectively (Francia
2017 & Chute 2019). The reasons for this development could be a result of the changing
means of everyday communication and interaction in the 2010s, and how new
information is obtained on account of the increasing popularity of social networks.
Moreover, this shift has had a significant impact on the U.S. presidential elections and
politics in general.
Barack Obama is widely regarded as the first presidential candidate to
utilize social media effectively as a means to communicate with the public and promote
his 2008 presidential campaign (Hollinger 2018). He was commonly considered a “social
media president” and was characterized for his ability to take advantage of the potential
of social media following an explosive increase in the use of Twitter in the late 2000s
(Bogost 2017 & Katz et al. 2013). However, Obama did not actually start using Twitter

2

Robin Kullberg
personally until 2011, when it was announced that tweets written by him from that
moment on were signed with the “-bo” signature (Boutin 2011; Bump 2013; Milian
2009).
As stated before, this chapter will deal with the influence of Twitter on
American politics since the 2016 presidential election and more specifically with how
political discourse has been affected by its extensive use. Firstly, in 2.1, I will explain
how Trump became an avid tweeter and what characterizes his general style of tweeting.
Secondly, in 2.2, I will discuss how Trump overturned a disadvantage in overall campaign
funds compared to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election to gain so-called ‘free
media value’ by utilizing social networks effectively. Thirdly, in 2.3, I will argue for how
social affordances on Twitter have shaped contemporary American politics – and vice
versa – and how these affordances can be used to outline the form and function of Trump’s
discourse on social media. And lastly, in 2.4, I will briefly discuss the theory of speech
acts as they will be of importance in the qualitative tweet analysis. Here I will again
mention Trump’s language use on Twitter

2.1 The Linguistic Mobilization of @realDonaldTrump
Donald Trump’s Twitter account @realDonaldTrump has existed for over a decade, and
Trump himself has quite exceptionally become increasingly engaged in managing his
own Twitter account as his political career has advanced. In contrast, most politicians
typically entrust the management of their official social media accounts to public relations
professionals and media directors (Chute 2019). The manner in which Trump initially
embraced social media was rather passive. It was Peter Costanzo who first introduced
him to Twitter as part of a marketing strategy (Oborne & Roberts 2017). Former media
director of the Trump Organization Justin McConney aided Trump from 2009 onwards
by reading, printing and delivering physical tweets which mentioned him and
subsequently managing @realDonaldTrump hands-on by tweeting on Trump’s behalf
based on his verbal response to the tweets (Choi 2018). Trump only started tweeting
actively in 2012, perhaps as a scheme in order to gain publicity and support for his 2016
presidential campaign. Prior to his presidency, it was not uncommon for Trump to center
his computer-mediated discourse on self-promotion and retaliation against rivals; as
president, these particular rhetorical strategies are arguably at the very core of his
discourse strategy on social media.

3

Robin Kullberg
Just like Obama, Trump has been referred to as the “Social Media
President” (Katz et al. 2013 & Jones 2015) due to frequently utilizing Twitter in order to
reach out to his supporters, to express his opinions, and to criticize his opponents.
@realDonaldTrump is essentially run by three people as of November 2019: President
Donald Trump himself; Brad Parscale, Campaign Manager for Trump’s 2020 reelection
campaign; and Dan Scavino, White House Director of Social Media (Chute 2019). This
study will inevitably include tweets which are not necessarily written by Trump himself,
but determining the actual source of Trump’s tweets will be dependent on a number of
factors. The linguistic elements of tweets posted by Trump himself are typically easily
identifiable, and they often mirror Trump’s rhetorical tendencies in his spoken language.
They often transmit emotional content and include conversational cues which he uses in
order to emphasize specific words or names. Typically, a tweet written by Trump himself
does not contain complex terminology and will likely appear to be grammatically flawed
and devoid of spell checks. Tweets not posted by Trump usually entail recurring
promotional phrases and links to news articles or videos, and do not convey strong
emotions and opinions (Puschak 2015a).
There are many explanations for Trump’s liking for Twitter, and besides his
public acclaim on Twitter being a highly functional tool for him to conveniently
communicate with (Ingram 2017), there are a number of crucial elements of the nature of
Twitter which can be linked to Trump’s social preferences. They will be discussed in 2.3.

2.2 The Free Media Thesis and Trump’s Succès de Scandale
The financial resources and efficacious public relations are essential properties for
candidates in any political election, and research suggests that regarding the outcome of
the 2016 Presidential Election, they were pivotal. Traditional media resources, such as
television, radio, and newspapers, are still very much useful platforms with which
politicians are able to promote themselves, but the rapid technological advancements in
recent times have allowed for political affairs to be influenced by social media as well.
Comprehensively utilizing the potential of social media in a presidential election is not,
however, as simple as such; the significance of financial resources is less significant, but
rhetorical resourcefulness is crucial.
Francia (2017) presents a theory which could serve to describe how the
significance of the money race, i.e. the comparison of money raised to finance a

4

Robin Kullberg
presidential campaign, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was ultimately overshadowed by a more important factor: the free media thesis. It is based on data from
MediaQuant, which quantifies different types of media exposure and computes a media
value of said exposure in US dollars based on how many people are reached with any
given public exposure. The free media value is inherently an indicator of how much free
media exposure would have cost each candidate (Francia 2017: 447). This ultimately
outlines how the publicity of both candidates can be measured quantitatively.
To explain the increasing value of social media in politics since 2012, it is
worth mentioning that the free media value gained by candidates Barack Obama and Mitt
Romney during a 12-month period in the 2012 Presidential Election was $1.15 billion
and $700 million respectively. While these values certainly played a part in the outcome
of the election, they appear small in comparison to the free media values earned by Trump
and Clinton, which stood at $4.96 billion and $3.24 billion respectively. Furthermore, a
timeline depicting free media value earned by Trump and Clinton as well as a comparison
of their number of followers on Twitter over the course of 2016 contribute to the
hypothesis that Trump dominated Clinton in unpaid media, hence reducing and perhaps
even eliminating her gross financial advantage in the Election (Francia 2017: 447–448).
The significance of this information is not only tied to a value measured in
dollars: one critical factor when determining the influence public exposure has on an
audience is obviously what is unmeasurable. Given the extent of social media use today,
it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are exposed to a tweet, for instance,
and crucially what the ultimate effect of that exposure has on the audience. There is no
guarantee that more people have seen social media posts about and by Trump compared
to Clinton; even if the number of followers would perhaps suggest such an assumption
(Francia 2017: 446).
There is another issue about drawing conclusions from this free media
thesis: the quality of the exposure for each candidate. There is a high possibility that
mentions of Trump in mainstream media as a result of his social media use are negative
in tone (Francia 2017: 450 & Patterson 2016), which would suggest that the free media
thesis does little to confirm the reasons behind Trump’s unexpected win in the Election.
Nonetheless, all forms of publicity for a presidential candidate can potentially boost their
public image. This relates to the theory of succès de scandale, which suggests that any
type of publicity will always be beneficial and that success can be achieved by
controversial means and due to scandalous character (OED 2020).
5

Robin Kullberg
The reality of the 2016 Presidential Election outcome was, then, that the
candidate who was the most talked about and, perhaps, the most controversial one went
on to win the election. It is widely argued that this came to be because of the free exposure
– both critical and supportive – Trump gained in various media during his hybrid
campaign (Lawrence & Boydstun 2017: 150). Furthermore, Friedman (2017) argues that
“Trump rose to power in part by tapping into distrust of government and the media in the
United States”, which indeed confirms Francia’s (2017) supposition. The truly odd
element of this matter is that in terms of number of tweets posted by the candidates during
a 12-month period prior to Election Day, Hillary Clinton published 5,353 tweets
compared to Donald Trump’s 3,886. The influence of social media on the 2016 Election
and its aftermath is multi-layered and complex to isolate, though undoubtedly evident.

2.3 Relevant Affordances and Features of Twitter
There is little doubt that Donald Trump’s social media use is considered to be contentious,
distinct and controversial, but, in light of what I have discussed so far, there is an obvious
need to ask oneself why that is. The basic affordances of Twitter are linked to the way
everyday communication is transmitted in social media contexts: the promptness of social
interaction and how large volumes of addressees can be reached instantly. They can be
described as essential features which have an impact on communication between senders
and receivers and which characterize social practices and contemporary discourse. As
mentioned, Twitter is an important tool of communication for both ordinary and public
figures in terms of its purposes, therefore one could argue that the affordances for any
discourse on politics are the same regardless of the user. Ott (2017: 60–62) argues that
“Twitter demands simplicity, promotes impulsivity, and fosters incivility”. This section
will deal with affordances and features of Twitter which inherently shape the way Donald
Trump uses language on Twitter and why his discourse on Twitter bears a resemblance
to tweets by the majority of ordinary people.
First, an important feature of Trump’s general rhetoric is the lack of lengthy
and complex phrases, as he often prefers to make use of simple and repetitive language
with a highly limited terminology (Kullberg 2018: 15–20). This type of rhetoric is in most
cases one which suits the style and format of Twitter which has a limit of 280 characters
per tweet – up until 7 November 2018 the limit was 140 characters (Rosen 2017). This
feature is an important factor in how messages are conveyed on Twitter, as it sets clear

6

Robin Kullberg
limits on how multifaceted and formulated a tweet can be. Due to the tendencies of
Trump’s spoken and written rhetoric, Twitter allows him to remain true to his principal
style of speaking and writing while tweeting: keeping it short and simple.
Second, Trump is known for not enjoying direct confrontations and
challenges by his opponents and media professionals – this is not least evident in the
number of White House press briefings which has significantly reduced during his
presidency. Though the frequency of Trump’s public briefings is in decline compared to
his predecessor, he has given interviews more often than any other president since Ronald
Reagan (Breuninger 2018). However, what can be considered problematic is that the
majority of his interviews are held at Fox News, a right-leaning news network whose
journalists rarely tend to openly criticize Trump’s policies. Meanwhile the White House
press corps, whose primary tasks include covering activities and news of the White House
and the president in an unbiased fashion, have been far less occupied since the start of
2017 in terms of reporting on the president (Breuninger 2018). Trump has publicly stated
that he favors Twitter as a means to convey information to his supporters as it gives him
complete control of the message and neglects any potential bias against him (Ingram
2017). On Twitter and other social media, he is able to bypass perplexing inquiries by
media workers to instead repeatedly and fiercely condemn them without having to face
opposing counter-arguments and, more importantly, without having to interact with a
human being face to face. In a mediated context, and especially on Twitter, Trump is able
to discount the need to produce formal language and stay true to his usual rhetorical style
when addressing the public.
Third, the power of Trump’s tweets is the inevitable public interest in them,
regardless of political stance. Trump’s tweets from 2015 and 2016 earned him a
significant amount of ‘free media value’ due to an eccentric and unconventional approach
to campaigning for president (Francia 2017). It is quite certain that Trump is aware of
how influential his tweets can be, as he has done little to limit the scale of
preposterousness and incongruity in his tweets during the past years. A prominent
instance of the influence Trump’s tweets have, even nonsensible ones, is the following:
“Despite the constant negative press covfefe”b which was followed by “Who can figure
out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ??? Enjoy!”c twelve hours later. The purpose of the

Robin Kullberg
initial tweet and the properties of ‘covfefe’ are not officially known, but the instrumental
cause for the case to become subject for a nationwide discussion is both Trump’s
supporters’ and opponents’ interest in his social media persona and an urge for them to
promote his discourse as entertaining, baffling or depraved in various media (Hunt 2017).
Because his Twitter account is under such heavy scrutiny, his tweets have indeed a certain
significant influence on mainstream media and social media regardless of the content of
his tweets; this is something that indeed boosts the symbolic power of Trump’s “Tweet”
button.
One important affordance of Twitter from a user perspective which surely
influences most of its active users is the so-called ‘Jackpot syndrome’ which refers to the
notion of social media creating psychological cravings much like those of gambling
(Selfhout et al. 2009: 820–821; Kross et al. 2013: 4 & Busby 2018). Frequently engaging
on social media stimulates the hunger for self-promotion, a connection to others and
belonging to a group, and Twitter does indeed encourage and reward this kind of reductive
mentality. It is likely that this phenomenon affects Trump as much as anyone else. It is
closely related to the ‘Facebook depression’ which, in turn, deals with the psychological
effects of spending too much time on social media and fixating on ‘likes’, ‘shares’ (or
retweets) and other means of engagement and communicating (Blease 2015: 2–5).
As stated earlier, hashtags are a common method of drawing attention to
one’s tweets and contributing to current online discussions. They are a way of indexing
specific keywords or trending topics on Twitter following the hash (#) symbol. With
them, the author can engage with their target audience easily and extend the range of the
visibility and outreach of their tweets. Furthermore, a hashtag allows the author to use a
contextual cue which adds more depth to the word or expression through repeated
exposure (Wikström 2014: 131). Therefore hashtags allow other Twitter users besides
active followers to be exposed to content, and in different ways. Finally, the use of a
hashtag is sometimes a replacement for features which Twitter lacks, such as bolding or
italicizing, and can at times function as a spontaneous meta-commentary on a topic
already at hand (Wikström 2014: 148–150).
I also mentioned retweets, i.e. reposting or sharing of other people’s tweets,
at the beginning of the chapter, and even though they will not be accounted for in the
tweets of Study 1 or Study 2, they require a brief remark. The purpose of retweeting is
comparable with that of using hashtags: it is the attempt to spread a message to a wideranging audience. Retweeting is also a measurement of tweet popularity and can be done
8

Robin Kullberg
either by clicking the “Retweet” icon of a tweet or by writing “RT” at the beginning of a
Tweet to indicate that they are re-posting someone else's content. Trump evidently favors
the latter technique, as nearly 80% of his retweets are structured this way (TTA 2020);
10.58% of these are retweets of his very own tweets.
To conclude, there are many obvious features and affordances of Twitter
which explain Trump’s liking for it. He undoubtedly enjoys the narrow format of the 280
character-long tweet and how Twitter allows him to connect with his supporters but at the
same time avoids direct confrontation with anyone. He also makes use of the fact that
mainstream media inexorably reacts to whatever he says on social media. While Trump
utilizes traditional aids of Twitter, such as the use of a hashtag or the action of retweeting,
he does so infrequently; it is perhaps a suggestion that he does not need to use such means.

2.4 Speech Acts and Trump’s Rhetoric
Speech acts are utterances which are used to perform requests, warnings, invitations or
promises, for instance (Searle 1969; Searle 1976 & Green 2017). They help us understand
the pragmatics, i.e. the communicative intention, of something said or written, and derive
from the Speech Act Theory which was introduced by Austin (1962) and primarily
developed by Searle (1969 & 1976). Speech acts on Twitter may also be called tweet acts,
and are considered equivalent in this context (Saha et al. 2019); one chief difference,
however, is that tweet acts are produced on solely in the context of CMC and are therefore
affected by the textual and social features set by the internet environment (Dayter 2018:
187–191). One such feature, or affordance, of Twitter is the elimination of the need for
physical proximity in communication, and the freedom from direct, continuous and realtime speech acts between users (Chandler et al. 2018: 376). Analyzing speech acts in
tweets is significant due to the rapid increase of political conversations on social media
in recent years (Hemphill & Roback 2014: 1208).
For this study, therefore, five main types of speech acts will be identified to
help define the qualitative features of each tweet. First, declarations are speech acts with
which the speaker or writer declares something or someone as being like something;
arrests, blessings or announcements belong to this group, for instance. They usually
require a certain authority or privilege to be considered official or proper. Second,
commissive speech acts indicate that the speaker or writer commits to a future action or
shows that he or she has the intention of doing something. They include promises, vows
9

Robin Kullberg
and threats. Third, expressives are speech acts which show expression via an utterance or
make certain assessments of psychological states – greetings, apologies and
congratulations are examples of these kinds of verbal actions. Fourth, directives are
commands, requests, challenges or invitations and are characterized by attempts to get
someone to do something or react in a specific way. They also include questions, i.e.
interrogative speech acts (Zhang et al. 2011: 86). Last, assertives or representatives are
speech acts with which a speaker or writer asserts his or her belief. They include, but are
not limited to, assertions, statements, suggestions and claims. Assertive speech acts are
quite common in the context of social media, as they basically are expressions of feelings
or facts.
I reflect on performative in-tweet speech acts in both Study 1 and Study 2,
and Trump’s language use will be under scrutiny especially in the latter. His terminology
and general rhetoric are arguably notorious in the world of politics; they are certainly not
considered ordinary when compared to a politician, and are not what has been
traditionally regarded as presidential (Shear et al. 2019). Key in Trump’s Twitter rhetoric
since the day he joined the platform has been engaging in personal attacks towards and
coming up with imaginative monikers, or nicknames, for people whom he despises or
dislikes (Meeks 2019).
In regards to what policy ideas of Trump can be considered drastic or
absurd, I suggest a brief look at the Overton Window (Mackinac Center for Public Policy
2019). It is a model which suggests how a wide range of opinions can be indexed,
categorized and labelled, and it essentially includes solely implications which are
considered widely accepted; ideas with which the vast majority of a society disagrees
usually constitute either total or no freedom and lie outside the Overton Window. For
instance, Trump’s rhetoric on immigration during his presidential campaign as well as
the term “socialist” used by Bernie Sanders during the same time reshaped the American
conjectural conception of the Overton Window (Robertson 2018). Trump has
undoubtedly reshaped certain facets of language use on Twitter and has managed to use
it to manipulate the press (Lakoff & Duran 2018).

3. Study 1: Quantitative Thematic Analysis
The first study comprises a collection of quantitative data from TTA which has been
manually categorized and structured in accordance with the lexical content of the tweets.

10

Robin Kullberg
It focuses on what specific media institutions and personnel have been mentioned in
Donald Trump’s tweets and how they have been framed. The analysis of the numerical
data in Study 1 includes remarks on the general nature of each type of tweet; the analysis
in Study 2, then, will feature examples of tweets representing each news network and
center around Donald Trump’s language use in said tweets.

3.1 Materials & Methods
The primary source for data-gathering in this study is TTA which is an online corpus
containing some 30,000 tweets posted by @realDonaldTrump since May, 2009. This
study excludes retweets and manual retweets, as my focus centers around Donald
Trump’s explicit output discourse on Twitter. Though retweeting content on Twitter
suggests endorsement, gratefulness and agreement, it would be problematic and
unwarranted to concurrently analyze the pragmatic features of two different types of
tweets. Study 1 includes five main categories; each category can be further subcategorized into separate news networks of each respective data set. The time frame of
the gathered tweets is 20 January, 2017 to 20 January, 2019, i.e. the first two years of
Trump’s presidency. The total number of tweets posted during this time is 5,435, of which
527 were selected for this study. The latter number is slightly inflated due to the
possibility of overlaps where several sub-categorical news networks are mentioned in a
single tweet.
Duplicated tweets which appear in succession have been disregarded as they
appear often enough to corrupt the overall number of tweets belonging to a certain
category. Overall there were 54 individual cases of tweet correction, i.e. repetition, and
due to some tweets being split into two parts, a total of 67 tweets fall into the group of
ignored duplicated tweets. Nonetheless, they are still included in the total number of
tweets, as they are part of the TTA corpus.
The choice of categories for this study was dependent on Trump’s tweeting
habits from a thematic and quantitative perspective. The frequency at which Trump
addresses news networks is an important characteristic of his discursive strategy on social
media. Therefore the categories presented in this study represent the most prominent
pragmatic aspects of his preferred computer-mediated discourse.
First, the category of tweets mentioning at least one news network contains
527 items and has a total of three sub-categories containing further five sections which

11

Robin Kullberg
indicate the political bias of each news network. The items are restricted to every single
tweet in which a news network has been mentioned or tagged using the symbol “@”.
Each item in this category will be manually indexed according to tone and attitude to
determine its qualitative characteristic as explicitly positive, indirectly positive, neutral,
indirectly negative or explicitly negative. The second category includes mentions of
media professionals who are employees of different media networks. Tweets belonging
to this category will also be manually indexed and categorized in order to define their
qualitative characteristics as either explicitly positive, neutral or explicitly negative in
tone. The qualitative attributes of both categories will be examined in detail in Study 2
with the help of salient examples.
One major focus of this study is Trump’s attitudes towards news networks
and potential political bias in news reporting. In order to arrive at a warranted and viable
conclusion in terms of defining the pragmatics of Trump’s computer-mediated discourse,
one needs to define the categorical news networks at hand as either left-leaning, mostly
neutral or right-leaning. The classification of each member is, however, extremely
difficult; therefore I will make use of the media bias charts of Ad Fontes Media, AllSides
and Media Bias/Fact Check to identify and categorize each news network as precisely as
possible.

3.2 News networks
Despite the polarized state of American politics during Donald Trump’s presidency, the
principal national conflict has not been that of Democrats against Republicans, but in fact
between Trump and what he consistently has referred to as the Fake News Media
(Conover et al. 2011; Trump 2019; Smith 2019). He has on several occasions criticized
news networks which he finds antagonistic and deceitful, while at times he has expressed
his approval and appreciation towards other news networks. Here, the former type of news
networks are identified as left-leaning, and the latter sort as right-leaning. The results in
Figure 1 show the total number of mentions of news networks in Trump’s tweets for a
two-year period ending on 20 January, 2019. This whole category is split into five distinct
sections which indicate the general political bias of each news network: hyper-partisan
right, right-skewing, neutral, left-skewing and hyper-partisan left. The horizontal colorindexes indicate the qualitative nature of the occurrences proportionally.

12

Robin Kullberg
Figure 1. Donald Trump's mentions of American news networks on Twitter (01/20/2017–01/20/2019)

3.2.1 Partisan Right News Networks
What initially is noteworthy is how the partisan right media is represented in this category.
With 211 (40.0%) mentions out of a total 527, Fox News is evidently a media institution
highly favored by Trump. Out of all right-leaning news networks, Fox News accounts for
94.2% of in-tweet mentions. Out of 58 positive remarks on any news network, 46 (79.3%)
were in reference to either Fox News as an institution or to a renowned employee of the
network. No instances of critical remarks on or hostility towards Fox News were found
in this study, which strongly suggests that Trump is particularly partial to its coverage.
There were 165 cases of neutral framing of Fox News, and the majority of these kinds of
tweets were promotional and therefore devoid of emotion; this might correspond with the
settings in and the people to which he prefers to give interviews. Other instances of neutral
framing includes a type of indirect, manual retweet action in which a news headline is
quoted along with a “@” tag for Fox News. The only other hyper-partisan right news
network to be mentioned by Trump during this period is CNS which is acknowledged
only once.
Right-skewing news networks The Washington Examiner, Washington
Times and New York Post account for twelve in-tweet mentions in total, with six
instances of neutral framing and six positive ones. Most tweets with references to these
news networks are directed towards a particular event in a news story with 50.0%
13

Robin Kullberg
containing congratulatory comments or show gratitude towards either the news network
itself or towards the author of a certain news article. The data on all news networks
mentioned so far might in fact correspond to how right-leaning media typically depicts
Donald Trump and matters related to his actions and policies; it might also hint at the
fundamental ideological stance and bias of Trump and the news networks in question.

3.2.2 Neutral News Networks
A more versatile selection of attitudes can be identified in the category of neutral news
network mentions. The Wall Street Journal saw 23 mentions, of which two were positive
in tone, seventeen were neutral, i.e. lacking in emotional content, and four were negative
in tone. There was one single reference to PBS in which the news network was subsidiary
and the main focus was the headline of a news story.
The slight shift in Donald Trump’s overall attitude towards news networks
at this stage is by no means surprising; his focus is evidently on news networks which
are, to some extent, politically biased. However, it is obviously the number of mentions
which is different: only 4.6% of all mentions in this study comprises neutral news
networks.

3.2.3 Partisan Left News Networks
Regarding Donald Trump’s mentions of the left-skewing and hyper-partisan left news
networks on Twitter, there are two interesting characteristics to observe. First, the number
of left-leaning news networks which appear in this study is higher the number of rightleaning news networks by two. Furthermore, it is clear that the respective sub-categories
appear proportionally somewhat extraordinary, given that Fox News is mentioned in
40.0% of Trump’s media-oriented tweets while the two second most mentioned news
networks each account for only 13.9% of the entire figure. Second, the number of total
mentions of left-leaning news networks is larger than that of mentions of right-leaning
news networks with 276 and 224 mentions respectively. These facts suggest that Trump’s
comprehension of the spectrum of American mainstream media consists of two
counterparts: Fox News and the left-leaning media. They also suggest that Trump
essentially addresses each category frequently but using highly different discursive
strategies in doing so.

14

Robin Kullberg
Out of 279 mentions of left-leaning news networks, three were positive in
tone and ten were neutral. Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN were remarked in
tweets with only negatively charged discourse. 98.5% of every negative mention was in
reference to left-leaning media while the positive mentions accounted for 6.8% of the
total number of positive remarks. The results for each of the bottom seven news networks
indicate a rather comparable pattern regarding the number of mentions and the qualitative
characteristics of said mentions. This is due to a large extent to the manner in which each
network is framed on Trump’s Twitter feed.
It is important to remember that while Fox News is consistently referenced
on its own in individual tweets, the majority of left-leaning news networks are often
framed as a collective whole, regularly appearing along with the label “Fake News
Media”:
So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What
about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!

(27 June, 2017)d

This example is one of several similar ones in which the framing device “They are all
Fake News!” specifies Trump’s attitude towards the six mentioned news networks in a
single tweet. The 118-character long tweet is a prime illustration of how Trump usually
depicts left-leaning media on Twitter. Due to Trump’s style of framing the left-leaning
news networks as a collective whole, the total number of individual tweets mentioning
one or several news networks is difficult to establish. It is therefore important to
remember that Figure 1 does not demonstrate the number of tweets in which each news
network is mentioned, but the actual number of mentions in any number of tweets. For
instance, the fact that the sole mention of CBS which is neutral in tone is also the only
tweet in which it occurs on its own speaks volumes for how frequently Trump combines
left-leaning news networks into a collective whole under a specific thematic label.

3.3 Media professionals
Donald Trump often mentions news networks on Twitter to show his appreciation for or
dissatisfaction towards current topics in American media, though occasionally he shifts

d

15

Robin Kullberg
his narrative to single out particular journalists, pundits, reporters or news anchors for
better or worse. The following section continues to deal with the same topic as in 4.2, but
attention now turns to individual media professionals whom Trump has mentioned on
numerous occasions. It is worth mentioning that perhaps the most notorious sequence of
attacks on a single person is Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the 2016 U.S. Presidential
election, whom Trump has referred to as “Crooked Hillary” over 350 times from April
2016 until September 2020 (TTA 2020). He has also made frequent use of the moniker
“Fake News” in reference to most mainstream media institutions (Pak & Seyler 2018 &
Smith 2019); from December 2016 to May 2020 he used it on Twitter in over 700
individual tweets as a reaction to negative reports on him (Bump 2018 & TTA 2020). A
part of Trump’s most used vocabulary will be presented in 3.4.
The results in Figure 2 show the number of mentions of selected media
professionals in Trump’s tweets for a two-year period ending on 20 January, 2019, with
two distinct sub-categories indicating the political stance of each journalist. They have
been selected on the basis of total number of mentions and the way they are depicted in
the tweets; the initial five people are renowned right-wing media personnel and the latter
five are, in turn, distinguished left-wing media personnel. It is therefore not possible to
approach this part of the study in a similar fashion to the previous part. Journalists of
neutral news networks are not included here as they are rarely mentioned by Trump. Each
mention here equals one individual tweet.

16

Robin Kullberg
Figure 2. Donald Trump's mentions of American journalists on Twitter (01/20/2017–01/20/2019)

3.3.1 Partisan Right Media Professionals
As mentioned above, Donald Trump is essentially more likely to promote his interviews
on Fox News than on any other news network. In such cases, he is also likely to mention
the person who is going to interview him, which is a key factor in the relatively high
number of mentions of Fox News journalists. The first sub-category of media
professionals includes Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network, Sean Hannity of Fox News,
Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Maria Bartiromo of Fox News, and Jesse Watters of Fox
News.
Out of the 59 mentions shown in Figure 2, 49 (83.0%) are neutral in tone
and are either tweets which comprise a news headline in quotations along with a tag on a
journalist or promotional tweets which announce an upcoming interview; 96.9% of the
neutral mentions were in reference to right-wing journalists. 13 (86.7%) of the 15 positive
tweets were directed towards right-wing journalists and no tweet in this sub-category was
negative in tone. As seen in this category of framing tweets, Trump does not criticize
right-wing journalists but frequently endorses them – he rarely does so with left-wing
journalists.

17

Robin Kullberg

3.3.2 Partisan Left Media Professionals
The second sub-category includes Jim Acosta, the chief White House correspondent
for CNN, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, Joe Scarborough, the co-host of
Morning Joe on MSNBC, Brian Ross, former ABC journalist, and Chuck Todd of NBC
News. All 12 negative tweets as well as one (3.1%) neutral tweet in this collection were
directed towards left-wing journalists, while two tweets included positive mentions of
Acosta. The latter tweets were contradictory in terms of tone, as they included both
criticism and praise. Furthermore, the way Trump frames each journalist is different;
these differences will be demonstrated in detail in the next chapter.
While Figure 2 resembles Figure 1 in the sense that leftist journalists receive
predominantly critical remarks from Trump and right-wing journalists are either praised
or mentioned in a neutral fashion, the main difference is the number of tweets aimed at
the two groups of media professionals. Partisan left news networks are mentioned
collectively quite frequently in comparison to mentions of individual people. In terms of
what tone Trump uses when mentioning each correspondent, the tendencies are strikingly
similar to those seen in Figure 1: partisan right journalists are often praised while partisan
left reporters are mostly criticized.

3.4 Trump’s use of Vocabulary and Speech Acts on Twitter
The last subchapter in this study encompasses two subsidiary collections of data. Tables
1 and 2 include quantified key terminology in Trump’s tweets from the first two years of
his presidency; the occurrences (N) here are not limited to tweets mentioning news
networks or media professionals.
The classification of “negative” and “positive” lexes is not entirely
straightforward, as some words are not necessarily appropriate in either category. For
instance, compete, fiction, big and wow are used by Trump in various contexts and with
different purposes, but their placement in the tables below depends on how he uses them
most often. Other examples, such as weak, disaster, love and success are more clearly
established as negative or positive words.
All words in Tables 1 and 2 appear in at least two forms. For example, sad
also includes the adverb sadly and the abstract noun sadness; and win comprises (among
others) the plural form or third person singular wins, the attributive winning and the
designation of a person winner. Apart from comprising several variants such as losing
18

Robin Kullberg
and loser, the word lose is on one occasion spelt incorrectly loose. This occurrence is
included in the total count for the word lose. Trump talks of himself in the third person
on five occasions, and the rest of the mentions of his whole name appear in retweets or
quotations, hence the bracketed figure.
While words such as fake, bad, great, big and thank appear hundreds of
times on their own, the tables include a handful of less frequent words such as distort,
untruthful, remarkable and impressive in order to illustrate the patterns of Trump’s
language use and his range of vocabulary on Twitter. It is evident that short and common
words are predominant and characteristic in his rhetoric and that he rarely uses words
containing more than three syllables. This pattern is evident in his spoken rhetoric as well
(Puschak 2015).
The majority of the words in Table 1 and Table 2 appear in tweets of Study
2 and will be discussed further in more specific contexts in the following chapter.

Tables 3 and 4 show what speech acts Trump uses in his tweets. They
illustrate the quantified data extracted from the 82 tweets in Study 2 and include five
different types of speech acts as described in Chapter 2. There are no major variations in
the way Trump uses speech acts to mention and frame any news network or media
professional. Assertives comprise 49.5% of all speech acts and directives just 5.7%, while
20

Robin Kullberg
expressives, declaratives and commissives make up 17.1%, 16.2% and 11.4% of the total
number of speech acts. The result in the tables below is not rather surprising, as Twitter
is mostly suitable for assertive speech acts, i.e. stating one’s opinions and beliefs
(Steinmetz 2013). For instance, the tweet presented in 3.2.3 features the distinct assertive
speech act They are all Fake News! with which Trump delivers his sentiments on the
news networks in question. There are no clear differences in terms of speech acts used
for respective mentions of partisan right and left media entities, i.e. there are no distinctive
uses of certain speech acts for a particular news network. They are mentioned in Chapter
4 when necessary and relevant for the qualitative analysis.
In comparison to general practices on Twitter, the speech act patterns
recognized in Tables 3 and 4 resemble those seen in Vosoughi & Roy (2016): posts in
which the author comments on entities or events are most likely assertives or expressives.
The low number of requests and interrogatives in Trump’s set of tweets also correlate to
this study in the sense that these types of speech acts comprise only a small quota of his
posts (TTA 2020). The distribution of speech acts in the tables below parallel the results
of El-Habel’s (2020) study on Trump’s speech acts.

The quantitative data presented in this chapter serves as a basis for Study 2 in Chapter 4.
I have quantified the total mentions of news networks and media professionals in 3.2 and
3.3, and indexed the most frequently used words by Trump on Twitter in general and
measured his speech acts in selected tweets in 3.4. The next chapter is closely tied to the
themes presented here.

21

Robin Kullberg

4. Study 2: Qualitative Thematic Analysis
The analysis of Study 2 includes a total of 82 separate tweets, 53 of which mentioning
one or several news networks, and 29 mentioning media professionals. Key in this chapter
will be presenting, examining, analyzing and explaining said tweets with the goal of
giving substance to the results of Study 1 thus outlining the nature of Donald Trump’s
Twitter rhetoric in greater detail. The thematic frame is limited to Trump’s relation to or
opinions on news networks and media professionals.
I will start by describing the materials needed for gathering and supporting
the data, and by discussing the methodology of the study. Thereafter a brief description
of the important and relevant linguistic elements will take place. Part 4.1 will include
remarks on how I intend to approach the actual analysis; 4.2 and 4.3 deal with the
qualitative thematic analysis.

4.1 Materials & Methods
As in the previous chapter, the primary source for data-gathering is TTA. All tweets under
scrutiny here are part of the dataset of Study 1, but 83.8% of the 527 tweets have been
disregarded for practical reasons. Every tweet has been manually selected for the purpose
of presenting a wide variety of linguistic elements and being able to qualitatively analyze
the data in an effective manner. Retweets have consequently been mostly neglected,
though a small number of so-called manual retweets have been included by virtue of
additional content added to a news headline or an extracted quote by Trump. The main
focus here will thereby remain on Trump’s explicit language production on Twitter as
opposed to his political or social standpoints.
Because of the aims of this thesis, the process of thematic tweet analysis is
going to be supported by scholarly works on speech acts by Searle (1969 & 1976). By
effectively defining not only the content of the tweets, but the performed action included
in the tweets as well, it is possible to more thoroughly comprehend Trump’s social media
strategy and what linguistic devices he uses in order to frame his enemies and endorse his
associates. The description of how speech acts occur in Trump’s tweets and proper
indexing of different linguistic elements will support both Study 1 and Study 2.
The process of conducting a thematic tweet analysis will be done according
to a number of steps. First, the collected data will be indexed according to different speech
acts occurring in the tweets. The number of tweets and the number of labelled individual
22

Robin Kullberg
cases of speech acts occurring will be different due to the possibility of one tweet
including several different speech acts. Second, the various qualitative linguistic features,
including speech acts, will be presented in subheadings 4.2.1–4.2.3 and 4.3.1–4.3.2 in the
same manner as the data in Study 1 was presented. I will extract the available material
and make brief remarks on relevant and interesting linguistic phenomena. Lastly, a more
detailed discussion on the findings will follow in the next chapter, where I will attempt to
form ties between the discussed previous studies and topic, the data and results from
Study 1 and Study 2, as well as my own conclusions from this thesis.

4.2 Tweet Analysis: News Networks
The first part of this study concerns the news networks mentioned by Donald Trump on
Twitter. Sections 4.2.1–4.2.3 include the analyses of 53 tweets in which at least one news
network is mentioned; however, the news networks are not represented equally in terms
of tweet quantity in this dataset. The reasons vary from certain news networks not being
mentioned enough times to them not being addressed in a way which would be interesting
in this study.
I will present the data in a similar fashion to the data in Study 1, meaning
that the first subheading deals with partisan right news networks, the second with neutral
news networks, and the third with hyper-partisan left news networks. Study 2 comprises
ten news networks as opposed to fourteen due to the fact that retweets have been excluded
from this thesis; the four news networks which have been dropped were simply irrelevant.

4.2.1 Partisan Right News Networks
The first part of Study 2 includes tweets which in different ways include mentions of Fox
News and The Washington Examiner. Fox News proved to be exceptional in Study 1 with
an overwhelming majority of mentions by Donald Trump compared to every other news
network. Out of the other four right-leaning news networks, Washington Examiner was
mentioned the most times (seven), and with most of the tweets mentioning right-leaning
networks being rather mundane, CNS, The Washington Times and The New York Post
were subsequently excluded from Study 2.
1. Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning. Great show!

(26 April, 2018)

23

Robin Kullberg
2. Thank you @foxandfriends. Really great job and show!

(27 October, 2017)

3. Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your
ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!

(5 February, 2018)
(1), (2) and (3) are all instances of expressive speech acts with which Donald Trump
expresses his gratitude towards Fox News. In (1) he uses the powerful word Loved to
describe how he felt appearing on their news show Fox & Friends, while in (2) and (3) he
explicitly offers his gratitude to the show with the phrase Thank you. In (3) he also
mentions that Fox News are exposing the truth, strongly hinting at having a high approval
of the network in general. The orthographic lengthening in soooo suggests a high intensity
of his attitude towards mainstream media and also further indicates his endorsement of
Fox News. It is also an interesting trait of Trump’s general language use on Twitter, as
such vowel lengthening is usually more common among adolescents (Steinmetz 2013).
This technique strengthens and accentuates the compliment.
The first tweets are types of tweets which occur quite often and characterize
the elements of Twitter which Trump enjoys: short and simple messaging as well as easy
and effective use of social media to speak publicly. Still, he regularly posts longer tweets
as well:
4. Wow, @foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings.

Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly, Fake
News CNN is also doing poorly. Too much hate and inaccurately reported
stories - too predictable!

(2 August, 2018)
5. Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the

Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so
much more. We are now starting to win again!

(20 February, 2018)
6. We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not

including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political
coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive
the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!

(27 November, 2017)

24

Robin Kullberg
In (4), (5) and (6) Trump challenges the limit of a single tweet with 246, 194 and 250
characters respectively. Each tweet includes a range of targets of which he makes brief
but strong assessments. There are a number of evident patterns showing in these tweets.
First, the structure of a tweet by Trump is usually not consistent but rather
sporadic and the tweets often appear to be spontaneously written in a similar fashion as a
journal entry. There is at least one element of consistent behavior that Trump adopts quite
frequently: the tone of his tweets is often either strongly positive or negative. In (4), for
instance, he starts off by saying that Fox News has higher ratings than the competition which most probably refers to every other mainstream news network - effectively
outlining a theme of conflict and rivalry in the tweet. In the second sentence he frames
Morning Joe and Fake News CNN in a highly critical manner by connecting them to the
terms dead, sadly and poorly. The last sentence concludes his message and elaborates
how the reader ought to understand the tweet by repetition: Too much hate [...] - too
predictable!. He thus conveys emotion through careful choice of terminology.
Second, Trump’s tweets are often highly informal. For instance, in tweet
(6), the purpose is not to express sympathies, but rather to comment on media bias and
news stories on himself in a humorous and sarcastic manner. The tweet includes both a
directive speech act as he urges the reader to imagine having a ‘contest’ according to his
description as well as a declarative speech act as he pronounces all Networks bad. He also
announces himself as the definitive favorite president before rounding off with the
vigorous FAKE NEWS TROPHY! to reinforce the overall theme of the tweet. It is
noteworthy to mention that tweet (6) is one of only six instances of Fox News not being
mentioned as either @foxandfriends or @FoxNews, meaning that Trump tags Fox News
97.2% of the time using the “@” symbol.
Third, Trump actively tweets in order to promote Fox News and, as seen in
Study 1, praises both the network as an entity and people appearing on their news shows
in order to support his own achievements. Much of his focus on Twitter is on how he
views Fox News in comparison to other major news networks; it is blatantly evident that
he rates winning highly and defines his political success by empowering phrases like We
are now starting to win again! in (5).
7. Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings.
They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart!

(24 January, 2017)
25

Robin Kullberg
8. Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my

presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade
and statements. Working hard!

(21 January, 2018)
Tweets (4), (6) and (7) are all examples of Fox News being mentioned, praised and
compared to CNN as the better news network. Tweets (4) and (7) are inherently similar,
as Trump declares Fox News as the winner in terms of ratings at the start of the tweet and
then proceeds to heckle CNN using the monikers Fake News and FAKE NEWS. For the
first two years as a president, Trump has written this expression on Twitter using either
title capitalization or complete capitalization as opposed to the minuscule variant “fake
news” 342 out of 352 (97.2%) times which strongly suggests a desire to making it more
established and recognizable.
Furthermore, in (7) Trump uses an expressive speech act to congratulate
Fox News on having ‘beaten’ CNN in inauguration ratings. Through this, he not only
praises the network but attempts to confirm his own success in the process of tweeting on
the inaugural address of Trump given the existing accord between Trump and Fox News
(The Inaugural Address 2017). The rhetoric in (8) is comparable to the previous example;
Trump thanks journalists of Fox News for doing something which inherently promoted
himself as a successful president and finishes the tweet with the self boosting phrase
Working hard!. As previously stated, this is a common feature in Donald Trump’s tweets
which both illustrates the theme of the tweet and frames the tweet subject(s).
9. Great job by MichaelCaputo on @foxandfriends.

(30 October, 2017)

An expressive speech act by Trump in (8) praises Michael Caputo, whose name is not
separated by a blank space yet interestingly is not tagged either, suggesting a careless and
indifferent writing process. These types of assertive appraisals only occur for people who
appear on Fox News and do not usually include information on why Trump has decided
to praise them.
10. Wow, “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,” according to @FoxNews.

11. Gold Star father, Ceejay Metcalf, whose great son Michael was just honored

at the White House, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends. He is a
special man!

(6 June, 2018)
Tweet (10) borders on being a manual retweet of a sort due to the citation being key and
a clear reference of the origin of the citation is made to Fox News. This type of tweet is
labelled neutral in Study 1, as it does not reveal any type of standpoint on the matter nor
is there a political bias conveyed. However, the interjection Wow does signify an
emotional status and a reaction to the news and appears to have been written by Trump
himself.
In (11), Trump actively makes use of a strong but simple choice of words
in order to frame his advocates: great, fantastic and special are used to give praise to
Ceejay and Michael Metcalf. This is inherently an example of the same strategy used in
(4), in which an assertive speech act and carefully chosen terminology define the outlook
of the tweet.
12. Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.

(18 December, 2017)

13. I will be interviewed by @MarthaMaccallum on @FoxNews tonight at 7pm.
Enjoy!

(28 April, 2017)
Tweets (12) and (13) are instances of promotional tweets – commissive speech acts –
which have occurred 34 times in the timeframe of the study, 30 of which are similar to
(13); 83.33% (25 of 30) of these were in reference to upcoming interviews on Fox News.
They are most likely not written by Donald Trump himself, as they invariably adopt the
basis I will be interviewed by [...] Enjoy!, therefore lacking the impulsive feel to the tweet
- a characteristic of tweets written by Trump himself. Tweets such as these are labelled
neutral in Study 1.
14. Thank you to the Washington Examiner and @CortesSteve on the great article
- on WINNING! https://t.co/b5dfUABN5q

(15 May, 2018)
In (14), Trump expresses his gratitude towards both Washington Examiner and Steve
Cortes and puts emphasis on WINNING through letter capitalization. Much like in (5) and
27

Robin Kullberg
(9), Trump’s focus apparently lies on himself and acknowledges both his own success
and his approval of the news network and the author in the tweet. Furthermore, the linked
article is arguably pro-Trump and compares Trump’s political success with general
achievements in sports, prompting Trump to write such a tweet.
15. “I’m taking this book with a grain of salt & everyone should do the same.
Multiple sources, but almost every one of them has come out and discredited
the claims made by Woodward. You cannot take this book too seriously.”
Katelyn Caralle, Washington Examiner

(10 September, 2018)
16. Washington Examiner - “MAGA list: 205 ‘historic results’ help Trump make
case for 2020 re-election.” True!

(1 January, 2019)
(15) and (16) are conceivably borderline-retweets, but, similarly to the case of (10), they
have been ‘actively’ tweeted by the president, meaning that they are still considered
regular tweets. Such posts on Twitter indicate the acceptance, endorsement and
promotion of someone else’s content, meaning that Trump here publicly supports and
praises the book review in (15) and the news article in (16). The finishing remark True!
in (16) is a typically trumpesque way of ending a tweet with a short evaluation.

4.2.2 Neutral News Networks
This subheading is exceptional in the sense that the content available for Donald Trump’s
mentions of politically neutral news networks is highly limited. Because PBS (the only
other neutral news network in Study 1) is mentioned by Trump on one single occasion,
The Wall Street Journal is the only news network included in this category for Study 2.
17. The Wall Street Journal asks, “WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK
OBAMA?” A very good question!

(21 May, 2018)
Donald Trump’s contempt for and suspicions towards Barack Obama are well-known,
and in (17) he refers to an article in The Wall Street Journal on Obama’s neglect on certain
political affairs to encourage his own narrative. The trumpesque capitalized quote
WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA? is a citation of a news headline
(Freeman 2018). The final sentence A very good question! reveals Trump’s sarcastic and
critical response to the article.
28

Robin Kullberg

18. The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good

relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that. I said
“I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference. Fortunately
we now record conversations with reporters […] and they knew exactly what
I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!

(14 January, 2018)
In (18), Trump’s intention is to correct a statement made by The Wall Street Journal by
asserting that they had falsely reported something he had said. The correction is a modal
verb contraction I’d have instead of the simple present I have, a difference which indeed
is grammatically significant, and big according to Trump. The following sentences is a
statement of skepticism towards journalists and could be seen as an indirect threat to
interviewers; the final phrase in FAKE NEWS! is used to frame the news network to the
tone of the tweet. Here the tone is hostility towards a media institution. The tone is set by
capitalization of the most vital part of the tweet along with common simple and
straightforward terminology. Interestingly, this is the only occurrence of Trump calling
The Wall Street Journal “fake news” and it is the longest tweet mentioning them,
consisting of 65 words and 358 characters.
19. Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions

the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other
countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging
are, and will be, pouring into U.S. coffers?

(2 June, 2018)
Tweet (19) is interesting in light of the common Trump rhetoric on Twitter. The message
of the tweet is one that is critical towards The Wall Street Journal, but here Trump simply
states his doubt over why the news network have not reported on tariffs. It seems as
though Trump is surprised over this and had expected something else from The Wall
Street Journal; he even explicitly states that they are well meaning, indicating that he does
not explicitly dislike them. This tweet is different from the majority of the data in the
sense that it is interrogative and does not include any actual statements or expressions; it
is therefore a directive tweet act.
20. Check out the recent Editorial in the Wall Street Journal @WSJ about what a
complete disaster the @CFPB has been under its leader from previous
Administration, who just quit!

(25 November, 2017)
29

Robin Kullberg
In (20), Trump endorses The Wall Street Journal by urging readers to [c]heck out reports
on the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) in an apparent directive tweet. The
endorsement is affirmed by the tag @WSJ. Trump’s tone is rather spiteful and gloating
towards the bureau. His choice of words complete disaster ahead of the terms @CFPB
and its leader from previous Administration effectively shapes Trump’s attack towards
Barack Obama, though, fascinatingly, without the mention of his name.
21. The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal
with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are
surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs &
making products at home. If we meet, we meet?

(13 September, 2018)
(21) is an example of how Trump uses contrast to illustrate his meaning. He starts off by
labelling The Wall Street Journal as wrong and discrediting their reports. The key element
in this tweet is Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing: this statement is a
representative speech act based on opinion and conjecture, as there is no evidence
provided in the tweet to support the statement. It is a rhetorical device to ensure the
appearance of success of the markets in the U.S. and the failure of Chinese markets – it
is the comparison of winning and losing. This is obviously a common feature of Donald
Trump’s narrative on social media. Furthermore, Trump’s prediction of taking in Billions
and strive for domestic production are also topics which have long characterized Trump’s
policy and rhetoric. Like Fake News, he prefers the capitalized spelling of billions, adding
to his apparent obsession for large sums of money: from July 2011 to October 2020 he
used the term billion or billions over 400 times and million or millions over 500 times
(TTA 2020).

4.2.3 Partisan Left News Networks
In this section I will present tweets in which ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, Buzzfeed News, NBC and CNN are mentioned. As demonstrated in the
previous chapter, the majority of tweets mentioning left-leaning or hyper-partisan left
news networks include several news networks under the label “Fake News”, making it
challenging to analyze the tweets as in 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. Due to the fact that news networks
in this category are viewed more negatively by Donald Trump compared to right-leaning
or neutral news networks, the contents of each tweet in this subheading will be quite
different.
30

Robin Kullberg

22. Despite so many positive events and victories, Media Reseach [sic] Center
reports that 92% of stories on Donald Trump are negative on ABC, CBS and
ABC. It is FAKE NEWS! Don’t worry, the Failing New York Times didn’t even
put the Brett Kavanaugh victory on the Front Page yesterday-A17!

(10 October, 2018)
In (22), Trump refers to himself in third person, something he is known to have done both
in real life and on Twitter, to assert his thoughts on the negative coverage of him on ABC
and CBS (Rieger 2019). Here there are two errors which need recognition: the first is
Media Reseach Center, a typographical error, and the second is ABC, CBS and ABC, two
separate mentions of ABC. Regardless of the obvious blunders, the tweet was never
deleted; however, from 20 January 2017 to 20 January 2019 there were 54 instances of a
tweet being deleted and edited within a short time: they are included in Appendix 2.
Immediately after mentioning the news networks Trump frames them negatively with the
phrase FAKE NEWS!, as he does with the Failing New York Times thereafter. The tweet
uses a total of 279 characters, which hints that Trump’s priority is not to compose
linguistically appropriate messages on Twitter, but to express his views swiftly,
substantially and frequently.
23. Look what Fake ABC News put out. I guess they had it prepared from the 13
Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt! #StopTheBias
https://t.co/c0XOk1btEQ

(20 June, 2018)
Here Trump uses the chant of “Fake News” in a peculiar way: Fake ABC News, in which
ABC is framed right in the middle of the ever popular expression. (23) is an interesting
tweet as it encourages the reader to look at a screenshot from the ABC News broadcast
of Trump himself with the caption “Manafort pleads guilty to 5 charges of
manslaughter”e. He then proceeds to speculate on the Witch Hunt, with which he refers
to the Trump-Russia investigation, and the 13 Angry Democrats, most likely meaning the
special counsel (McCarthy 2018). Lastly, the hashtag #StopTheBias is used as a defense
mechanism, most likely indicating that Democrats and ABC News are plotting against
him.
Since joining Twitter, Trump has used hashtags in 10.8% of his tweets (TTA
2020). While it is problematic to accurately define hashtag use regularities and tendencies
e

Robin Kullberg
on Twitter, Saxton’s et al. (2015: 156–158) study on hashtag usage suggests that over half
of all tweets posted include one or more hashtags. This, in turn, implies that Trump’s
hashtag use is drastically lower than the average Twitter user. Comparatively, Hillary
Clinton, Congressman Mike Rogers and Senator Ted Cruz included hashtags respectively
in 16%, 53.05% and 64.65% of their tweets prior to 2018 (TTA 2020).
24. Don’t miss our GREAT @FLOTUS, Melania, on @ABC @ABC2020 tonight at
10pmE. Enjoy!

(12 October, 2018)
25. Interview with David Muir of @ABC News in 10 minutes. Enjoy!
(25 January, 2017)
Tweets (24) and (25) bear striking resemblance to (12) and (13) as they are promotional
commissive tweets with the purpose of advocating Trump himself or someone close to
him. Most of these kinds of tweets are concluded with the usual catchphrase Enjoy! and
often include mentions tagged using the “@” symbol, making them more available and
widespread to the public. The mention of Melania Trump in (24) is unsurprisingly
preceded by the capitalized modifier GREAT. What makes (25) intriguing is comparing
it to the tone of tweets (22) and (23), in which ABC News is heavily criticized by Trump.
The key difference is that the emphasis in the latter pair of tweets is on himself and his
wife, in which the tone is comprehensively neutral or marginally positive; while the
former tweets are attacks pointed at ABC News and negative in tone. Trump exhibits
strong positive and negative emotion using capitalization, repetitive terminology and
exclamation.
Out of the 25 tweets mentioning ABC News, eight included a mention using
the “@” symbol and twelve included mentions of one or several other news networks.
26. So much Fake News being put in dying magazines and newspapers. Only

AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast.

28. Will be interviewed tonight by @LesleyRStahl on @60Minutes @CBSNews at
7:30 P.M. Eastern. Enjoy! https://t.co/eUTAP0u0Uh

(14 October, 2018)
Based on the data gathered, CBS is not under heavy scrutiny from Donald Trump. Out of
nine mentions, (28) was the only tweet in which no other news network was mentioned,
suggesting that CBS is possibly viewed as part of a collective by Trump. Tweet (28) is,
like (12), (13), (24), and (25), a commissive tweet which promotes an upcoming interview
without genuine emotion and passion.
Evidently, (26) and (27) include a total of four different news networks all
piled into one single target under the descriptions Fake News, Fiction writers!, The Fake
News Networks, sick and biased, and The “Fakers”. These are examples of what has
come to shape and define Donald Trump’s rhetoric as president. His narrative is supported
by negative terminology such as dying, worse, sick and dishonest and continuous
discourse on the deteriorating relationship between himself and mainstream media. It is
quite common for Trump to make use of simple simile to describe a state of affairs using
words such as “dying”, “win”, “lose” and “enemy” (Kullberg 2018 & TTA 2020). They
are emotionally charged high-frequency words with an established meaning.
“Fake” is not the only moniker Trump has lodged for left news networks;
in (22) we saw The New York Times used with the modifier Failing. Like “Fake News”,
Trump has put effort into systematizing the term using initial capitalization:
29. Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the

Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the
Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my
opinion, don’t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!

(7 July, 2018)
30. Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of
television a day - Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both
of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called
the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting.

(11 December, 2017)
Out of 76 mentions of The New York Times, 52 included the moniker Failing such as
seen in (29) and (30). These kinds of tweets are packed with criticism and can be typified
as assertive diatribe; these tweets consist of 278 and 279 characters respectively. Though
Trump to some extent exaggerates the use of the moniker “Fake News”, he rarely applies
it when mentioning The New York Times.
33

Robin Kullberg
Both tweets include admission of belief: anonymous sources that, in my
opinion, don’t exist and CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. Even
though Trump attempts to convince the reader that the news networks mentioned are
unreliable and false, he openly states that his arguments are based on his own opinions
and assumptions. The grammatical and syntactical structure and coherence of (29) and
(30) are irregular and interruptive: the tweets contain respectively six and eleven marks
of punctuation, of which commas are mostly used; interruptive phrases such as in my
opinion and if ever halt the flow of the tweet. Trump manages to insult and attack four
separate media entities within the boundaries of a single tweet. The targets are effectively
framed using simple and punchy terminology along with the final phrase Bad reporting
which he uses to define the news networks and journalist he has attacked.
31. “Disability applications plunge as economy strengthens” Failing New York
Times

(23 June, 2018)
Here Trump has quoted a news headline into a borderline-retweet. He is known to have
focused substantially on financial matters while in office and has most likely posted (31)
to promote both his own achievements as president and The New York Times for writing
the news article. Interestingly, even in a case where Trump openly advocates and refers
to them, he insists on using the moniker Failing to still appear critical towards them.
32. Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G.

Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about
the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake
News has morphed into phrase, “Enemy of the People.” Sad!

(29 July, 2018)
In (32), Trump speaks rather fondly of The New York Times publisher A. G. Sulzberger.
His message is inherently about him and Sulzberger allegedly agreeing on the mediarelated controversies addressed by Trump ever since before becoming president. In
reality, Trump had been asked not to reveal the details of the discussion and Sulzberger
had, in fact, stated his concern for Trump’s attacks on news networks (McCausland 2018).
This tweet drastically contradicts tweet (29) which was posted 22 days prior and which
was highly critical of and hostile towards The New York Times. Trump seemingly
changes his opinion on news networks sporadically and momentarily.

33. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book, “THE RUSSIA HOAX, THE

ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD
TRUMP,” going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon. It is indeed a HOAX and
WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced.
Great book!

(3 August, 2018)
In (33), The New York Times is not the focal point, per se, but it is referred to due to the
book of Gregg Jarrett reaching success. Unlike in (31), the moniker Failing is not used
here, but the mention is simply a tag with the “@” symbol – an exceptional occurrence
and not how Trump typically frames The New York Times (TTA 2020).
34. The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Habberman
[sic], known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don’t speak to and have nothing to
do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his
relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip.” They use […] non-existent
“sources” and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with
a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who
I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets
them out of trouble, even if […] it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I
don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest
media!

(21 April, 2018)
35. If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t
retain the services of Michael Cohen!

(22 August, 2018)
Though presented here as one, tweet (34) is made up of three separate posts including
123 words and 673 characters. It is an attack towards The New York Times and White
House correspondent Maggie Haberman, whose name Trump has misspelt, and includes
several hostile arguments. As in (33), The New York Times is not tagged with the
moniker Failing, but is indeed under heavy criticism from Trump. Haberman, however,
is framed using the designations third rate reporter and Crooked H flunkie. Trump
defends Michael Cohen in (34), whom he frames in a more positive conduct with a fine
person with a wonderful family and a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have
always liked & respected. Furthermore, Trump aligns Cohen against concepts that he
dislikes: Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the
dishonest media!. It is an expression of being allied to Cohen to some extent and
endorsing him; it is also a declarative statement on the media figures mentioned. Tweet
(34) contains a high number of single-syllable words and the syntactic format is simple
in general.
35

Robin Kullberg
(35) was posted some four months after (34) and is an example of Trump
abruptly changing his opinion on a person. Here he discourages Cohen as a lawyer
somewhat sarcastically and reverses his narrative. (35) does not relate to how The New
York Times is framed, but reveals a great deal about Trump and how he uses Twitter to
frame both media outlets and prominent statesmen.
36. So true! “Mr. Trump remains the single most popular figure in the Republican
Party, whose fealty has helped buoy candidates in competitive Republican
primaries and remains a hot commodity among general election candidates.”
Nicholas Fandos, @nytimes

(8 September, 2018)
In (36), Trump expresses his approval of a news article mentioning his popularity within
the Republican Party with So true!. It is a borderline-retweet and does not frame The New
York Times or its employees in any way; the focal point is himself and his popularity.
37. The Failing @nytimes, the pipe organ for the Democrat [sic] Party, has become
a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are
wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!

(30 November, 2017)
38. The Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before.

They used the concept of “time value of money” in doing a very old, boring and
often told hit piece on me. Added up, this means that 97% of their stories on
me are bad. Never recovered from bad election call!

(3 October, 2018)
Tweets (37) and (38) were posted almost ten months apart, but include several interesting
features. Trump uses Failing to frame The New York Times in both tweets, with the
addition of the description the pipe organ for the Democrat [sic] Party and a reference to
the conception of winning and losing as a way of explaining his displeasure towards them
in (37). The expression the pipe organ is a rather unique manner of framing The New
York Times and is not used in a tweet in this timeframe; Trump uses it metaphorically to
illustrate his conception of the relation between The New York Times and the Democratic
Party.
In (38), he comments on them us[ing] the concept of “time value of money”
and expresses his amazement for this. The general tone in both tweets is negative and
mocking: They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner! indicates that due
to the heavy criticism it endured by The New York Times, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
36

Robin Kullberg
2017 will be a certain success (Kessler 2017). Both tweets are filled with trumpesque
terminology: wrong, winner and bad – words which Trump uses to depict The New York
Times negatively. They are inherently assertive tweets with a conversational style of
writing.
In (29) we saw a mention of The Washington Post combined with the
moniker propaganda machine for Amazon. Like The New York Times, The Washington
Post is a media outlet to which Trump has applied other monikers than “Fake News” and
which he often (30 times out of 43) mentions on its own; The New York Times was
mentioned on its own in a total of 67 individual tweets. These trends suggest that Trump
prefers making attacks on these particular newspapers more personal and explicit.
39. The Washington Post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not

exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give
them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a discgrace
[sic] to journalism but then again, so are many others!

(3 July, 2018)
(39) contains a relatively diverse rhetoric aimed at The Washington Post. Here Trump
questions the origin of their published content using the recurrent expression anonymous
sources in order to frame them negatively; he used it 13 times during 2018 to attack leftwing news networks on Twitterf. In this particular tweet, anonymous sources is put inside
quotation marks, with which Trump seemingly quotes The Washington Post. Anonymous
sources are a problematic aspect of general credibility of journalism; the use of such
references is disputably not entirely straightforward or established from an ethical
perspective (LaFave 2016 & Candanosa 2019). However, the fact that source protection
is often necessary in journalism makes the matter somewhat double-edged (Posetti 2017:
7–10).
The last sentence contains a typographical error discgrace [sic], suggesting
that Trump himself posted the tweet without the aid of a media director. The post was
replaced 19 minutes later with a correction on this word – most likely courtesy of a
member of Trump’s media team (Feinberg 2017; O’Connor 2017; Chute 2019 &

McWorther 2019)p. Furthermore, he indirectly expresses his malignance towards other
unspecified media outlets to conclude the tweet.
40. The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up
made [sic] garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting.
Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. Story on John
Kelly isn’t true...just another hit job!

(8 April, 2018)
Similarly as in (39), tweet (40) is a query about the credibility of The Washington Post
and an assertion of their alleged untrustworthiness in American mainstream media. Here
key terminology is what characterizes and intensifies the tweet: fiction, garbage and
poorly have been used by Trump dozens of times to depict something which he opposes,
and he metaphorically compares a Washington Post news article to an assassination with
the last sentence Story on John Kelly isn’t true...just another hit job!. There are a few
parts of (40) which resemble Trump’s ordinary oral language, such as the lack of a
moderately complex clause, the parenthetical phrase (not names) and the fact that a part
of the sentences lack the appropriate pronouns and articles: Always quoting sources…
and Story on John Kelly…. These features likely exist partly due to the restrictions of
Twitter in terms of the number of characters permitted in one tweet.
41. A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the

FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two
minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who
would do this in a public space with live security [...] cameras running. Another
False Accusation. Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the
women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home
mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn’t fit the Mainstream
Media narrative.

(20 February, 2018)
(41) is another example of a relatively long piece of discourse by Trump. It is made up of
two separate tweets containing 274 and 250 characters respectively, and The Washington
Post is mentioned in both parts: it is first depicted following the moniker Fake News and
later tagged using the “@” symbol without being explicitly under attack but with a
comparison to Fox News. Here Trump attempts to deny the sexual harassment story by
Rachel Crooks which trended on mainstream media at the time (Saslow 2018). He does

38

Robin Kullberg
not mention her name in the tweet but opts to call her A woman I don’t know and, to the
best of my knowledge, never met in order to create distance to the topic and makes a
definitive rejection of the case with the exclamatory phrase Never happened!. He then
proceeds to argue that it would be absurd to kiss someone with live security cameras
running and concludes his argument with the capitalized alliterative phrase Another False
Accusation. As seen here and in a handful of prior tweets, one of Trump’s strategies of
criticizing news networks is by questioning their actions or lack of action: Why doesn’t
@washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about
me?. The effect is that accusations and complaints appear less extreme and Trump himself
is portrayed as speculative rather than prosecuting. Finally, Trump mentions the
Mainstream Media narrative and asserts that Fox News is not part of it while The
Washington Post is.
42. Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost. It discusses
the enthusiasm of "Trump" voters through campaign [...] contributions. The
RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, and much of it by my wonderful
small donors. I am working hard for them!

(7 October, 2017)
In (42), Trump expresses his disbelief to the fact that he finally got a good story in the
@washingtonpost and indirectly praises them by celebrating the economics of the
Republican Party (RNC) in comparison to the Democratic Party and his own professional
morale. Even though he talks about the contents of the article by The Washington Post in
a positive manner, it is not a praise of them, but instead a praise of himself. Like in many
other tweets by Trump, money talks and is inherently what defines success for him: The
RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems is his way of pinpointing the upper hand of
his political party and to plainly frame the opposition in a negative way; it is also how
Trump illustrates his admiration for wealth. The tweet as a whole is made up of two
different posts but as it was published prior to 7 November, 2017, the previous character
limit of 140 per tweet intrinsically restricts its overall length.
43. A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time
against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!

(22 July, 2017)
In (43), Trump calls for INTELLIGENCE LEAK[s] from The Washington Post to stop.
He expresses his allegiance to then U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions and former director
39

Robin Kullberg
of the FBI James Comey. The moniker Amazon Washington Post is used by Trump to
castigate them and advertise the fact that both Amazon and The Washington Post are
owned by Jeff Bezos (Farhi 2013). He seemingly prefers using the moniker Amazon more
often “Fake News” in general, making the framing Fake News Washington Post a less
frequently used expression by Trump on Twitter; as of the end of September 2020, he has
mentioned The Washington Post a total of 31 times alongside Amazon but only six times
next to the expression “Fake News”g (TTA 2020). Furthermore, there are two minor errors
in the tweet in the form of omitted spacing after a comma, and after a full stop, suggesting
a rush or indifference in the actual writing process.
The New York Times and The Washington Post are news networks which
have often been criticized by Trump with 73 and 43 mentions during the first two years
of his presidency respectively. They are unique in the sense that they are usually
mentioned on their own in tweets and hold exceptional denominations such as “Failing”
and “Amazon”. Buzzfeed News are only mentioned twice in the same period following a
scandalous incident of questionable reports on the “alleged collusion between [Trump’s]
election team and Russia” in January 2019 (BBC News 2019):
44. Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited “Dossier,” paid

for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research), on
which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism, but a
great day for our Country!

(18 January, 2019)
45. Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time

restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3
years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful
Buzzfeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!

(19 January, 2019)
Tweets (44) and (45) represent a relatively coherent and nimble reaction by Trump to
events in mainstream media in comparison to most previous samples of this study. Both
tweets are long – 261 and 280 characters respectively – and contain few marks of
punctuation in comparison to other tweets. The terminology used, on the other hand, is
quite trumpesque: he depicts his enemies critically using monikers such as Crooked
Hillary Clinton, negative vocabulary like discredited, sad and disgraceful, as well as
contrastive expressions in order to frame his opponent and promote his own agenda such

Robin Kullberg
as A very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!. Words of importance
are capitalized, as seen in other tweets: Dossier, Country and Mainstream Media. In (45),
Trump makes a somewhat vague reference to [m]any people to support his argument on
mainstream media recovering its credibility. The whole tweet is made up of a single
sentence with 45 words, which according to Cutts (2009: 1–5) is well above the average
sentence length and runs the risk of being too difficult for the reader to grasp.
Interestingly there is not a single personal attack on Buzzfeed News along
the lines of Fake ABC News in (23) or Failing New York Times in (38), but instead the
entire discourse in the tweet is a medium for denouncing their reports. The expression the
disgraceful Buzzfeed story in (45) is de facto not a personal charge on Buzzfeed News as
a media outlet, but rather a kind of one-time criticism towards their published content. It
is worth mentioning that despite this quarrel, there were no direct attacks on Buzzfeed
News by Trump after 20 January, 2019. The same cannot be said of NBC and CNN:
46. Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our
U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!

(11 October, 2017)
NBC is the third most mentioned news network by Trump and has, like all partisan left
news networks, been subject to harsh criticism by him for many years. Tweet (46) is a
reaction to a news story on Trump’s meeting with US national security leaders in which
he allegedly expressed his wish to increase the capacity of the country’s nuclear arsenal
(Kube et al. 2017; Baker & Kang 2017). In the beginning of the tweet, NBC News is
framed with the moniker Fake and tagged with the “@” symbol. It is one of 17 instances
of them being tagged. Trump uses the expression made up twice in order to emphasize
his assurance that the news story he refers to is untrue. The second sentence is his reaction
to his own claim in the first sentence and binds NBC News to the expressions [p]ure
fiction and demean. The conclusion of the tweet is an exclamatory declaration that NBC
News equals CNN. This statement only gains meaning with knowledge of Trump’s
relationship with and general attitude towards mentioned news networks and essentially
indicates that he dislikes them equally.
47. NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a
disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!

(4 October, 2017)

41

Robin Kullberg
In (47), Trump expresses a similar kind of disinclination towards NBC as in (46) but does
not refer to a specific event or topic. Instead he uses a number of common trumpesque
rhetorical means to frame a news network he disapproves of: he uses the hashtag
#FakeNews to enhance the spread and recognition of the term; he attempts to demonstrate
his doubts about the credibility of NBC News by saying that they are more dishonest than
even CNN – using analogy to condemn his enemy; he makes use of negative and punchy
terminology to frame NBC News, such as dishonest and disgrace; and in the last sentence
of the tweet, he underlines the concept of success and failure, and characterizes it through
the measurement of TV ratings as an intimidation strategy.
48. NBC News has totally and purposely changed the point and meaning of my
story about General Robert E Lee and General Ulysses Grant. Was actually a
shoutout to warrior Grant and the great state in which he was born. As usual,
dishonest reporting. Even mainstream media embarrassed!

(14 October, 2018)
49. Thank you to NBC for the correction! https://t.co/L2mX3vREOl
(14 October, 2018)
NBC News was mentioned a total of 54 times in the data time frame and only once in a
positive tone. This particular instance is tweet (49), in which Trump thanks them directly
for correcting a minor mistake in an earlier tweet (TTA 2020). Tweet (48) was posted
some six hours prior, and illustrates how promptly and spontaneously Trump publishes
his reactions to news reports on himself. Both (48) and (49) were posted within hours
after a news report on Trump’s rally by NBC News (NBC News 2018 & TTA 2020). The
correction that is referred to in (49) confirms his own statement in (48). The intriguing
part of this pair of tweets is how Trump effectively frames a news network negatively in
the morning – As usual, dishonest reporting. Even mainstream media embarrassed! – and
praises them later on the same day – Thank you to NBC for the correction!.
The last news network in the first part of Study 2 is CNN, which has already
been mentioned in several tweets. It is, like most of the other hyper-partisan left news
networks, more frequently mentioned in tweets along with at least one other news
network; out of 73 mentions, CNN was only framed on its own in 32 (43.84%) instances.
As stated in Study 1, all tweets in which CNN was mentioned were negative in tone.
50. Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming
me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to

42

Robin Kullberg
September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them
they go wild and scream, “it’s just not Presidential!”

(26 October, 2018)
In (50), Trump discusses his relation to mainstream media outlets and mentions CNN
specifically above other mainstream news networks. They are framed with the moniker
lowly rated which is an uncommon label in Trump’s rhetoric on Twitter. The tweet is a
reference to the October 2018 mail bombing attempts (Rashbaum et al. 2018). He
expresses his astonishment at the media criticizing him and conveys a sense of being
treated with prejudice and hostility. The citation “it’s just not Presidential!” relates to the
authority and image of Trump as president - a topic which he has previously addressed in
public; in July 2017 he tweeted “My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s
MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.”h, thus attempting to redefine the general conception
of what ‘presidential’ means and showing that he has a rather distorted comprehension of
the original meaning of the term.
51. I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN!
(1 July, 2017)
52. #FraudNewsCNN #FNN https://t.co/WYUnHjjUjg

(2 July, 2017)

Tweets (51) and (52) were posted on consecutive days in July 2017 and are solely focused
on CNN. First Trump reveals that he is planning on changing his use of the hashtag
#FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN; the aforementioned hashtag was used by Trump
on seven occasions as a prefix to CNN before (51) was posted and the latter hashtag has
ever been used by Trump twice (TTA 2020). These facts conflict the basic purposes of a
hashtag, which include categorizing and promoting a specific person, firm or event (Kywe
2012: 337–338). Donald Trump is not known to frequently make use of hashtags in
general: only 621 (11.26%) of all tweets posted by him from 20 January 2017 to 20
January 2019 include one or more hashtags.
Both tweets above illustrate a peculiar framing strategy; Trump does not
explicitly describe CNN in any way besides using the prefixed FakeNews and
FraudNews. It is a way of depicting them negatively in an effective but concise and
simple manner – the tweets only contain 69 and 18 characters respectively. In addition to
h

Robin Kullberg
the typographical content of (52), an edited video is embedded in the tweet in which
Trump physically attacks Vince McMahon whose face has been replaced with the red
CNN logo (Mazer 2018: 187). The ties between the US president and mainstream media
are unequivocally disclosed in the linked video. Tweet (52) is the most retweeted post by
Trump with over 467,000 retweets, and the fourteenth most ‘liked’ tweet with more than
500,000 likes as of August 2020 (TTA 2020).
53. Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their
election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox

(20 March, 2017)
In (53) CNN is once again mentioned with the prefixed moniker Fake News, though this
time without it being a hashtag. The tweet was posted exactly two months into his
presidency and is a reference to election polls of late-2016. The motive is twofold; firstly,
Trump describes and depicts CNN with Fake News and bashes on their polls by calling
them a WAY OFF disaster which is emphasized in the capitalized letters; and secondly,
the familiar action of comparing a left-wing news outlet with Fox News with the help of
a comparative adjective is what defines Trump’s Twitter rhetoric. One common discourse
topic for Trump as president has been polls and how they define victory and loss; he
criticizes the polls of his enemies and celebrates polls which are in his favor in order to
affirm his own triumph (Kennedy et al. 2018).

4.3 Tweet Analysis: Media Professionals
The second part of this study will concern the media professionals, i.e. news anchors, TV
hosts, political commentators and pundits, mentioned by Donald Trump on Twitter during
his first two years as president. Sub-heading 4.3.1 is the analysis of thirteen tweets
mentioning right-leaning media professionals, and 4.3.2, in turn, comprises the study of
sixteen tweets mentioning left-leaning media professionals. Because Trump rarely
mentions journalists of neutral news networks, such a category was omitted from Study
2. Tweets are, again, sometimes presented in pairs or groups in order to analyze intertweet connections or divergences more conveniently.

44

Robin Kullberg

4.3.1 Right-leaning Media Professionals
As in the first part of Study 2, I will start by analyzing Trump tweets which mention rightleaning journalists. This section sees the mention of a total of twelve people, yet focus is
on the five following media correspondents: Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network, Sean
Hannity of Fox News, Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Maria Bartiromo of Fox News, and
Jesse Watters of Fox News. The quantitative data on their mentions by Trump is presented
in sub-chapter 3.3.
54. “President Trump has done more for minority groups in this country than any
president in decades.” @LouDobbs

(28 August, 2018)
55. Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump
Administration an A+. S.C.,reg cutting,Stock M, jobs,border etc. = TRUE!

(23 July, 2017)
Tweet (54) is a borderline-retweet in which Trump does not address Dobbs directly but
rather simply agrees with his cited statement. It is an indirect positive mention of Dobbs
and is presumably a tweet with the purpose of complimenting Trump himself. Similarly,
then, in (55), the mention of Dobbs is overshadowed by Trump congratulating himself on
the basis of Dobbs’ ‘review’ of his presidency, but here Dobbs is addressed directly – in
capital letters, nonetheless. In these cases, as in 21 (84%) of all mentions of the Fox News
pundit, he is tagged with the “@” symbol, which effectively enhances exposure and
promotion.
The previous character limit of Twitter is evident in the format of the tweet:
while the character limit of 140 is met, the syntactic rhythm and appearance changes
around halfway through the tweet. The sentence Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving
the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+ could be considered a fairly
normal expressive speech act and normal in terms of basic sentence structure. The second
part of the tweet, S.C.,reg cutting,Stock M, jobs,border etc. = TRUE! is not as easily read
and understood. It includes three instances of word clipping: ‘The Supreme Court’ is
abbreviated to form S.C., reg cutting stands for ‘regulation cutting’ and ‘stock market’ is
shortened to Stock M. Furthermore, there are three cases of missing spacing after a comma
which makes the tweet appear opaque and bulky. The increased number of spaces at the
end of the tweet highlights the concluding expression TRUE!, which is a typical way for

45

Robin Kullberg
Trump to end his tweetsi and with which he attempts to convince the reader that the first
sentence is true. Interestingly, this reveals to us the priorities of Trump’s Twitter
discourse: his acclaim, appraisal and success are set out in a neat and clear fashion while
secondary information is conveyed in a careless and detached fashion.
56. “Prosperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would

do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful
president, in modern American history.” Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs!

(17 July, 2018)
In (56) we see a series of congratulatory speech acts. Like in (54), the majority of the
tweet is a citation, but on this instance Dobbs is designated with the title the great after
being thanked. The actual statement by Dobbs is powerful and romantic in a sense, and
due to the reaction by Trump, one could state that in this case, ‘one hand washes the
other’, meaning that they both greatly benefit from the public endorsement of one another.
57. Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs. “We take up what
may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history.”

(13 October, 2017)
Tweet (57) is quite similar to (54) and (56) in terms of style and content; a comment by
Dobbs is quoted and the tweet is completed with a mention of him. In (57), there is an
even more elaborate remark on Dobbs: Such a wonderful statement from the great
@LouDobbs. He is once again given the label the great, and the mention is further
embellished by the description of the statement being wonderful. It is a very positivetoned and affectionate tweet which illustrates the accord between Trump and Dobbs.
58. I will be interviewed tonight by Trish Regan on @FoxBusiness at 8:00 P.M.,
right after the great Lou Dobbs!

(16 October, 2018)
In (58), the tweet is structured similarly to examples (12), (24) and (28); it is a commissive
tweet which serves to promote both Trump himself and the news network conducting the
interview. The only difference is the last clause right after the great Lou Dobbs! which

46

Robin Kullberg
directly promotes Dobbs’ TV program. Even if the main focal point of the message is his
interview with Regan, praise is given exclusively to Dobbs.
As seen in tweets (54) to (58), Trump demonstrates his liking for Dobbs
through a series of expressive speech acts and by calling him the great Lou Dobbs on
three occasions. This particular moniker is used by Trump quite frequently, as the great
or the greatest appears in 188 tweets during the first two years of Trump’s presidency;
the only clear pattern in its usage is the high number of references to various U.S. states
following The Great, as illustrated in (48)j.
59. I will be interviewed tonight on @FoxNews by @SeanHannity at 9pmE. Enjoy!
(11 October, 2017)
60. Big ratings getter @seanhannity and Apprentice Champion John Rich are right
now going on stage in Las Vegas for #VegasStrong. Great Show!

(19 October, 2017)
(59) is a plain and simple example of another interview promotion which includes the
same elements as seen in the previously mentioned tweets. Out of 18 mentions of Hannity
of Fox News, eleven are tweets which closely resemble the structure and style of (59);
six only include a quoted news headline or a statement along with the mention of
Hannity’s name; and one example, tweet (60), involves Hannity being mentioned and
framed explicitly. The tweets above were posted roughly one week apart. In (60) he is
described by Donald Trump as a [b]ig ratings getter and his appearance in Las Vegas is
acclaimed with the description Great Show!.
Every single mention of Hannity is tagged using a “@” symbol. His and
Trump’s relationship has grown a great deal as a result of such mutual promotion (Shaer
2017 & Abadi 2018). In comparison to how Trump mentions Dobbs, Hannity is, however,
mostly acknowledged in a neutral or semi-positive manner.
61. Congratulations to Tucker Carlson on the great success of his book, “Ship of
Fools.” It just went to NUMBER ONE!

Robin Kullberg
The relationship between Trump and Fox News presenter Carlson is difficult to
characterize, as Carlson is usually portrayed positively on Trump’s Twitter feed despite
having publicly criticized Trump on several occasions (Folley 2019). In (61), Trump
congratulates Carlson on his published book going to NUMBER ONE. The letter
capitalization indicates an emphasis on the ranking of the book – and it once again
pinpoints Trump’s predilection for competition and winning. Furthermore, Trump has
promoted his upcoming interviews with Carlson twice in the same fashion as seen in (59).
62. .@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: “How did somebody so

obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?” Now
that is a really good question! Then followed by “Richard Blumenthal of
Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...” So true, a total Fake!

(16 August, 2018)
In (62), Trump quotes Carlson firstly on his critical remarks on former CIA director John
Brennan and secondly on his interrogative statement on Senator Richard Blumenthal, and
adds brief comments of his own as a reaction to Carlson’s content. The first comment is
Now that is a really good question! – which is a similar remark as in (17), for instance –
where the criticism of someone is expressed through the assessment that someone else
has asked a good question.
The second Carlson quote includes the upper case word FAKE which has
apparently triggered Trump to do so as well: So true, a total Fake!. Inherently, Trump
does not directly bash Brennan and Blumenthal in his tweet, but uses the rhetoric of
someone he approves of to attack them. The reactions which he places after the quotes
make it seem like he is engaged in conversation with someone and that he is nodding to
and thus confirming Carlson’s remarks, but not saying them himself.
63. I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10:00
A. M. Enjoy!

(30 June, 2018)
64. Just watched Sunday Morning Futures with @MariaBartiromo on @FoxNews.

This show is MANDATORY watching if you want to understand the massive
governmental corruption and the Russian Hoax. It will be rebroadcast this
evening at 6:00 P.M. on @FoxBusiness. A must see!

(16 September, 2018)
Trump mentions Bartiromo of Fox News a total of nine times, four of which resemble the
promotional rhetoric in tweet (63). Out of the bunch, two mentions are directive speech
48

Robin Kullberg
acts in which Trump encourages the reader to watch “Sunday Morning Futures”. They
are also assertives due to the fact that Trump openly expresses his standpoint on
Bartiromo in them. He underlines his support for her with the upper case adjective
MANDATORY and the endorsing wrap-up A must see!. Tweets which resemble (59) and
(63) are marked in Study 1 as neutral mentions.
The massive governmental corruption and the Russian Hoax is a reference
to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016
election, which Trump has labelled a ‘witch hunt’ and ‘hoax’ dozens of times as president
(Burke 2018)k. The case is known as one of the most controversial domestic political
events of Trump’s presidency.

65. Jesse Watters “The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the
White House.” So true!

(3 June, 2018)
In (65), the addressee, Fox News journalist Jesse Watters (Tani 2017) is mentioned
plainly and without a tag in the opening of the tweet and is followed by the quote “The
only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.”. Out of the five
times he is mentioned, three include a tag with a “@” symbol – one of which refers
directly to Watters’ TV Show “Watters World”. The phrase So true! at the end of the
tweet is a trumpesque feature which Trump uses to praise Watters and indicate his
approval of the citation.
66. I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch
@JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the
White House waiting for Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping
our Country both at the Border and from within!

(12 January, 2019)
Trump points out three groups of different people in (66). First, he mentions Jeanine Pirro
of Fox News, whom Trump promotes as his interviewer that day. The first sentence
resembles the typical structure of a promotional tweet by Trump, but it only makes up 64
of the 276 characters of the whole tweet. It is a neutral mention with no particular
emotional stake in it.

k

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/999984492197613568 [28 September, 2020]

49

Robin Kullberg
Second, Watters and TV talk show host Greg Gutfeld are praised by Trump
in a directive speech act: Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. Trump
characterizes the three mentioned pundits with the phrase All terrific people and
drastically switches his focus thereafter.
Third, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer are framed with the recurring moniker Cryin’l (Kim 2019); Schumer has been
assigned this nickname on 13 occasions. In this part of the tweet, Trump switches from
future to present tense and neglects the use of a tag with the “@” symbol and a mention
of their full names. Moreover, the first three sentences are short – 64, 51 and 20 characters
respectively compared to 138 in the last sentence – and they end in full stops while the
last sentence is an exclamation. This suggests a change in Trump’s attitude and emotion
as he mentions people of different groups. It therefore also reveals how he writes about
people: his comments on right-wing allies are usually brief, while his attacks on left-wing
journalists are more extensive.

4.3.2 Left-leaning Media Professionals
In this section I will analyze tweets in which left-leaning journalists are mentioned and
framed in different manners. The following tweets include the mentions of a total of
sixteen people, but the following people are focal points in this section: Jim Acosta, the
chief White House correspondent for CNN, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, Joe
Scarborough of MSNBC, Brian Ross, former ABC journalist, and Chuck Todd of NBC
News. Like in the previous heading, the quantitative data on their mentions by Trump is
presented in sub-chapter 3.3.
67. Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH
sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems
caved...gambled and lost.” Thank you for your honesty Jim!

(23 January, 2018)
Tweet (67) is comprises both attacks and acclamation. It is a reaction to a tweet by Jim
Acosta as well as the end of a government shutdown (Nelson 2018)m. The first phrase is
assertive and concerns two of Donald Trump’s enemies: Acosta, who is framed as Crazy,

Robin Kullberg
and CNN itself, which is recognizably portrayed along with the prefixed nickname Fake
News.
The second part of the tweet is a citation of Acosta’s tweet posted on 22
January, 2018, which is followed by the expressive phrase Thank you for your honesty
Jim!. Trump effectively assaults and praises Acosta in the space of one 190 character
tweet, but the compliment at the end is based on how Trump himself is depicted in this
tweet. It is another example of his competitive fixation on winning and losing: Trump
wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost is a phrase with which he
confirms his own success and the defeat of his enemies. He then supports this assertion
further by saying that the author of the quote is ‘honest’. Trump actually thanking a CNN
employee can be regarded as an anomaly in the data.
68. So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time

(they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday
of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn’t! But they did say I already lost
in my meeting with Putin. Fake News...... [...] ....Remember, it was Little Jeff
Z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said I could not win
the election in that “there was no way to 270” (over & over again) in the
Electoral College. I got 306! They were sooooo wrong in their election
coverage. Still hurting!

(14 July, 2018)
(68) is a lengthy tweet consisting of two separate posts which includes many interesting
linguistic features. Five of the nine sentences are made up of only two or three words –
two of which are verbless – and there are a total of 31 marks of punctuation, which
arguably makes for a rather disjointed tweet format. It is a rather exclamatory tweet with
a total of four exclamation marks; they appear each time at the end of short sentences.
Trump describes the ratings of CNN in the second sentence using the
hyperbole dying to indicate a lack of success. The takedown which Trump then mentions
is a reference to him refusing to answer a question by Acosta in a news press conference
the day before (Schwartz 2018). He concludes the first part of the tweet with Fake
News…… as a result of CNN not reporting on the mentioned incident but rather
publishing an article on his press conference with Vladimir Putin (Collinson 2018). Even
though Trump reportedly refused to answer any questions by Acosta, who represents and
works for CNN, a news network that he openly dislikes, he acknowledges that Acosta is
actually a nice guy. This suggests that the relation between Trump and Acosta is divergent

51

Robin Kullberg
from what would normally be expected of the current president and an employee of a
hyper-partisan left news network.
The second part of the tweet starts with the directive discourse marker
Remember which is followed by a mention of Jeff Zucker of CNN who is framed with
the belittling moniker Little. The phrase Little Jeff has occurred three times on Trump’s
Twitter feed and one of them include an incorrect spelling of Zucker’s last name as
Zukern. Trump brands CNN as Little Jeff Z and his people, who are told exactly what to
say as a means to not only insult Zucker personally, but to depict the employees of the
network as a mob of indoctrinated followers as opposed to a credible group of media
professionals.
In the last part of (68), Trump takes a stab at the pre-election coverage of
CNN – a recurring topic on his Twitter feed – and boasts about getting 306 electoral votes.
There are three features in the last two sentences which Trump uses to frame CNN
negatively. Firstly, he evaluates and criticizes the opponent as he concludes the tweet:
They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage; secondly, he emphasizes said
evaluation using the vowel lengthening sooooo – a conversational cue which effectively
resembles oral and informal output; and lastly, the negative terminology is what sets the
tone: dying, wrong and hurting. The absurd thing in light of this is how Trump starts the
tweet: So funny!, which indicates that he enjoys castigating CNN and people associated
with it.
69. The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General
(Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly.
Their quotes were made up frauds, a con on the public. Likewise other stories
and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?

(4 September, 2018)
All eight mentions of Bob Woodward during this time frame occurred between 4
September and 10 September 2018, and all of them are in reference to Woodward’s Fear:
Donald Trump in the White House (2018) which paints an “unflattering portrait of
Trump’s White House” (Pilkington 2018). (69) and (70) were posted less than four hours
apart and are part of the narrative seen in all tweets mentioning Woodward.
In (69), Trump refers to James Mattis and John Kelly in a polite manner and
uses the terms refuted and discredited to support his attack towards Woodward. He then

vaguely asserts their quotes, [...] other stories and quotes to be made up frauds and a con
to the public; Trump has used “made up” and “fraud(s)” 33 and 38 times during this time
frame respectively, while “con” has appeared in a total of eight tweetso. They always
occur in attacks against hyper-partisan left media or Democrats.
Tweet (69) is concluded with two questions. The first question lacks an
interrogative word which changes the intonation and tone of the meaning: the intensity
and extreme nature of the sentence Woodward is a Dem operative? is toned down as a
result of the question mark. It creates a sense of insinuation and interrogation as opposed
to outright accusation. The last question Notice timing? further increases Trump’s sense
of bewilderment to Woodward’s book.
70. The already discredited Woodward book, so many lies and phony sources,

has me calling Jeff Sessions “mentally retarded” and “a dumb southerner.” I
said NEITHER, never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being
a southerner is a GREAT thing. He made this up to divide!

(4 September, 2018)
At the start of (70), Trump uses the detracting terms discredited, lies and phony once
again to denounce the credibility of his enemy. Here he cites Woodward twice and
explicitly denies calling Sessions “mentally retarded” and “a dumb southerner” and
furthermore denies using those terms on anyone. While it is true that (70) is the only time
the words “retarded” and “southerner” appear on Trump’s Twitter feed, it is a fact that he
has used the word “dumb” twenty times to describe events or people related to hyperpartisan left media or Democratic Party during the first two years in office. He thus
manages to use the terms repetitively while denying actually saying them.
To stress his contempt for Woodward’s book, he reverses the statement to
which he referred in the first sentence of the tweet: being a southerner is a GREAT thing.
This exclamation adds a touch of patriotism to the rhetoric of the tweet. The final attack
on Woodward in (70) reads He made this up to divide! and is in fact one of only three
cases where he is personally under fire from Trump and where his actions and character
are explicitly questioned or criticized.
Similarly as in (34) and (35) with Michael Cohen, Trump’s narrative on
Sessions differs in (70) when compared to his previous remarks on him. There were

o

53

Robin Kullberg
numerous critical remarks on Sessions by Trump from July 2017 to December 2018;
instances on which Trump praises or defends Sessions occur mainly in early 2017p.
71. The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage

of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many
have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction.
Dems can’t stand losing. I’ll write the real book!

(10 September, 2018)

In this 276 character long tweet, powerful and repetitive terminology is what composes
an effective framing strategy. The initial capitalization of Joke indicates a will to make
the term appear official; the repetition of assault adds to the significance and
aggressiveness of the word; the label fiction is a recurring term in Trump’s tweet and
usually in regard to left-wing media; and finally, Trump’s fixation on winning is evident
at the end of the tweet where he links Dems to the term losing and expresses his intent to
write the real book. Apart from the last sentence, which is an exclamatory commissive
speech act, the tweet is an assertive statement and a harsh piece of criticism towards
Woodward’s book.
Woodward is, unsurprisingly, not tagged using the “@” symbol in a single
mention, but is, curiously, not appointed a personal moniker of any kind in any of the
eight mentions. As mentioned previously, there are only three clear cases where
Woodward is personally under attack by Trump. The first case is the last sentence in (70);
the second is “Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the Midterms”
from a tweet from 10 September 2020q; and third, “The author uses every trick in the
book to demean and belittle” from a tweet from 7 September 2020r. The last instance is
very unlike the regular Trump rhetoric in this context as it frames Woodward passively
as the author.
Instead of engaging in unambiguous personal attacks, Trump looks to frame
the book and its composition; these aspects are described as refuted, discredited, frauds,
cons, fiction, a scam, made up, a Joke and a barrage of assaults (TTA 2020). Curiously,
the insults on the actual book are more variable than those on Woodward himself,
meaning that the attacks are not as personal as seen in attacks towards other left-wing

media professionals. Furthermore, Woodward has identified and spoken about the
complicated relationship between Trump and mass media; according to him, problems
arise from both the emotions and political bias of journalists as well as Trump’s criticism
of established media outlets (Concha 2018). Despite this, Woodward and Trump have
engaged regularly for interviews ever since the 2016 presidential election.
There are only five tweets from Trump’s first two years as president
mentioning the TV show “Morning Joe” or Joe Scarborough with two of those also
mentioning co-host Mika Brzezinski. It is a relatively small number of mentions given
that they have been both praised and criticized by Trump on Twitter over 70 times as of
September 2020s.
72. I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch

anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came
[...] to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on
joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!

(29 June, 2017)
Tweet (72) is one segment of a brief internet war between Donald Trump and the
“Morning Joe” TV hosts (Ortiz 2017). In contrast to (69), (70) and (71), one of the most
important features of tweets mentioning Scarborough and Brzezinski is an unflattering
prefixed nickname before someone’s name. Here Trump attacks three separate entities:
both of the aforementioned TV hosts as well as the TV show on which the recipients
appear. The Twitter account for the TV show is tagged using a “@” symbol and is framed
with the moniker poorly rated, Brzezinski with low I.Q. Crazy, and Scarborough with
Psycho. The first moniker has been used by Trump to frame left-wing media networks or
professionals a total of five times ever, three of which are in reference to Scarborough.
All in all there are 13 uses of low I.Q. and 252 uses of Crazy on Trump’s Twitter feed,
and Psycho has been put to use 26 times, of which 20 were used to frame Scarborough
(TTA 2020).
The first part starts with Trump stating that he heard [that] @Morning_Joe
speaks badly of [him], personifying the TV show into Scarborough himself or Brzezinski
herself. He then adds the parenthetical notion (don't watch anymore) to illustrate his
contempt for it to a greater extent. What follows is a 28-word question – which lacks a

question mark – which Trump uses to contradict the alleged criticism by Scarborough
towards himself.
The last sentences are rather incongruous as they portray both individuals
as intrusive and Brzezinski particularly as bleeding badly from a face-lift. Finally, I said
no! is an example of the recurring trumpesque finish to a tweet; it is short, simple and
exclamatory. It also a tool with which Trump objects to Scarborough and Brzezinski and
essentially denounces their anti-Trump rhetoric.
73. Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their
low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!

(1 July, 2017)
The basic structure of (73) is integrally similar to that of (72): Trump’s enemies are
framed at the beginning of the tweet, the middle part includes an assertion which gives a
picture of his attitude towards said enemies and a description of their character, and the
finish is a short exclamatory phrase which Trump uses to set the ultimate tone for the
entire message. Here, Scarborough is framed using the moniker Crazy, and he is
addressed by his full name, while Brzezinski is framed as dumb as a rock. The latter
moniker has been used by Trump a dozen times on Twittert. Of all 25 mentions of
Brzezinski as of August 2020, all but two cases omit her last nameu. This might indicate
difficulties in spelling “Brzezinski” but is nevertheless a suggestion that Trump tends to
avoid writing her name.
In addition to Scarborough and Brzezinski being framed again as a pair,
their TV show is under attack as well. This time Trump refers to their low rated show
[being] dominated by their NBC bosses, which implies that he thinks they are subjugated
and repressed by the NBC network. The term low rated is once again an example of
Trump’s passion for ratings, which he views as the measurement of success and failure.
Regardless of Trump persistently attacking the duo and of the already
acknowledged insults towards them both, he simultaneously defends them, saying that
[they] are not bad people. This statement contradicts much of his usual rhetoric in regard

to how he frames left-wing media professionals, and can certainly be considered a
compliment in this context.
74. So now tha [sic] Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at
NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low
ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in
Florida years ago? Investigate!

(29 November, 2017)
Tweet (74) consists of two interrogatives in which Trump mentions anchor Matt Lauer,
MSNBC president Phil Griffin and Scarborough, and is concluded with another short
punchy cliffhanger. It was posted some five months following the media feud which
included the previous two tweets and it originally included the spelling mistake tha which
was corrected 16 minutes later with a new tweet.
The tweet includes the unique remark practitioners which is prefixed with
Trump’s signature expression Fake News. This aim at Griffin is the one and only mention
of his name and is therefore not a recurring target for Trump. The “unsolved mystery” in
the second question, in which Trump encourages the firing of Scarborough, is a reference
to a death that occurred at Scarborough’s Florida office when he was a member of
Congress (Bever 2017). Here Scarborough is personally framed with the nickname low
ratings and with a heavy allegation which suggests that he has had something to do with
said incident.
While Trump indeed associates Scarborough with a death incident in (74),
he does so latently, as opposed to the mention of “Morning Joe” in (4), where the show
is explicitly described as dead. This inclination reveals a great deal about Trump’s
framing strategy: one way he attacks and slanders his enemies is by linking them to the
concept of death.
75. Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of

people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked
the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!

(31 May, 2018)
(75) is made up of two separate, yet similarly structured, lines of attacks: one is aimed at
Disney executive Bob Iger and the other at Brian Ross of ABC News (Nelson 2018b).
Both cases are initiated with questions and then followed by accusations. The tweet is,
essentially as usual, concluded with an exclamatory phrase which sets the tone for the
57

Robin Kullberg
entire tweet. Although the tweet appears to be a ‘twin attack’, meaning a tweet consisting
of two identical cases of framing, some differences occur.
To start off, Trump’s first question Iger, where is my call of apology? is
demanding and urgent, and only mentions the target by his last name. It effectively
establishes a complication which is about to be addressed and it creates pre-framing to
put the blame on Iger. Also, Trump addresses Iger directly at the very beginning which
makes the tweet appear to be directed at him personally as part of an argument. The
second sentence You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a
response. is once again a direct stab at Iger and a personal attack; here he appears in the
second person. The inclusion of the term millions of people, though vague and
unwarranted, amplifies Trump’s criticism. Furthermore, “them demanding a response”
is an alternate way of Trump saying that he demands a response, but this particular phrase
appears more powerful and is not an uncommon expression in Trump’s Twitter
vocabulary (TTA 2020).
The start of the second attack, then, is as mentioned also a question, though
of a very different kind. How is Brian Ross doing? is pragmatically not too different from
the first question, but it sets up the attack in a different way. Though it is a relatively
simple and straightforward question regardless of context, here it can be identified as a
sarcastic remark given how Trump addresses Ross in this tweet and on other occasions.
He is addressed by his full name, however, in the third person, which means that Trump
shifts his approach and implication as he switches from one attack to another.
ABC is mentioned twice and is essentially under attack in the whole tweet
with Double Standard! referring to the news network and not Iger or Ross. Similarly as
seen with the term Fake News, the term has initial capitalization. With the word apology
occurring twice in the tweet, it is apparent that Trump uses repetition to establish his
message to the reader. The contextual details of the attack date back to December 2017
when a media outrage emerged following “a bombshell – but incorrect – report on
President Donald Trump and former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s previous
outreach to Russian officials” (Griffiths 2017a). Tweets (75) to (79) are all in reference
to this and are the only instances of Trump mentioning Ross.
76. Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his

horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia
Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake
News!

58

Robin Kullberg
(2 December, 2017)
77. People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based

on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has
been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the
damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!

(3 December, 2017)
Tweets (76) and (77) were posted less than 24 hours apart and have a few similar
elements. The 217 and 279 character-long posts both mention ABC News, which Trump
has tagged using a “@” symbol, and Brian Ross, and include forthright directive speech
acts: More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News! is an
implication that news networks ought to sack journalists which report so-called Fake
News; and People […] should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC is an
encouragement for the general public to file a lawsuit against ABC News following the
aforementioned incorrect report. They are also overrun by Trump’s customary
terminology; horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report and False and Dishonest
reporting are inherently parallel phrases made up of both comparable and identical
adjectives which are used to describe the reports in question.
Because both tweets are essentially explicitly and evidently meant to be
offensive, it is astounding and somewhat humorous that (76) is simultaneously a praise
of ABC News. Of all 25 mentions of this particular news network, it is the only instance
where Trump unmistakably congratulates them (TTA 2020). It is likely that this occurs
solely because of the public humiliation of ABC News and Ross and it is, nevertheless,
conceivable that Congratulations to @ABC News is not an applause for ABC News but
a sarcastic remark.
78. Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were
caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be
immediately fired for his “mistake”). Watch to see if @CNN fires those
responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?

(9 December, 2017)
In the week after (76) and (77) were tweeted, Trump engaged Brian Ross along with ABC
News and CNN in (78). The last-mentioned is primarily under attack, and the vicious and
purposeful mistake refers to CNN being forced to correct a story about the Trump
campaign and a WikiLeaks incident concerning Donald Trump Jr. (Restuccia 2017;

59

Robin Kullberg
Griffiths 2017b & Stewart 2017). CNN is mentioned twice and tagged using the “@”
symbol, which occurs in 32.5% of all mentions of the network.
The attack on Ross occurs in the subordinate clause just like lonely Brian
Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”) in the middle part
of the tweet. Here Trump frames him as lonely, which is a low-frequent moniker in
Trump’s tweetsv. The term is presumably a remark on Ross’ suspension following the
aforementioned incidents in the media, suggesting that he is lonesome due to being
suspended by ABC News. The directive speech act in parentheses sees Trump
encouraging the immediate firing of Ross. The word mistake is put within quotation
marks to not only increase emphasis on the word itself, but to indicate that it was possibly
a purposeful and malicious doing by Ross.
He effectively links his assaults by also discussing the notion of CNN
potentially firing those responsible at the end of the tweet, though in a speculative
manner. There is not one single exclamation mark in this tweet, which instead has an
interrogative tone as it is concluded with a question mark. The assertive accusation is
placed at the beginning of the tweet and the closing directive question conveys a sense of
astonishment as opposed to allegation.
79. Brian Ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that

drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars), was suspended
for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity. He is no longer
allowed to report on Trump. Should have been fired!

(6 January, 2018)
In this 279 character-long tweet, Ross is solely framed as a result of returning to work at
ABC News following the suspension due to a fraudulent live newscast. Trump
summarizes his conception of Ross using 124 characters in the modifier the reporter who
made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points
(billions of dollars). During the first two years of Trump’s presidency, the word
“fraudulent” was used ten times to characterize his opponents in either politics or the
media; as of September 2020, the figure is 65 in totalw, which indicates that he started
using the word more often from 2019. This is repetitive rhetoric as it resembles the

Robin Kullberg
language in (77): ‘the Stock Market declining 350 points’ is Trump’s way of underlining
that the market indeed dropped 350 points at one stage after Ross’ incorrect report was
published, though the long-term drop was approximately 40 points (Feldscher 2017).
Trump supports his assertion with the parenthetical phrase (billions of dollars).
References to large amounts of money is a typical argument by Trump. He also frames
ABC News secondarily due to the network being Ross’ employer; he does so by
capitalizing its name: ABC NEWS.
The first sentence is the entirety of Trump’s observation on Ross’ return to
work, while the last two sentences comprise his own directive commentary on the matter.
In the second to last sentence, he refers to himself in a third-person narrative form which
is not an exceptional tendency in @realDonaldTrump. Though most illeisms, i.e.
mentions of the name ‘Trump’, on his Twitter feed are part of quotations, the rhetoric in
He is no longer allowed to report on Trump does occur periodicallyx (Mishra et al. 2013).
This might reflect on either Trump himself or on his social media persona.

(4 September, 2018)

The final media professional mentioned by Trump on Twitter to be presented in this study
is Chuck Todd of NBC News. He is mentioned in only three tweets, i.e. (80), (81) and
(82), over the two-year period.

Robin Kullberg
These tweets feature a number of similar elements. First of all, Trump
frames Todd with the moniker Sleepy Eyes, which he has done consistently since 2012y
(Steinmetz 2018). In 50% of all mentions of Todd as of September 2020, Trump has used
this moniker to attack him. However, it is interesting to note that, as of September 2020,
he has not used it to frame anyone else on Twitter ever, making it a moniker which is
solely devoted to Todd.
Secondly, Trump ties the framing of Todd closely to that of NBC News as
well as the capitalized word Fake. These lexes appear at the beginning of each tweet
underlining their standing, with the exception of Fake in (80), which appears along with
the secondary news content to which Trump refers.
Thirdly, the tweets are quite lengthy: they comprise 139, 279 and 258
characters respectively, meaning that (80) and (81) are one character short of reaching the
permitted limit of a standard tweet length. In (81), the quantity cap of a tweet is evident
in the style and flow of the post: two conjunctions are styled as & and the parenthetical
so great for World lacks the definite article the.
Lastly, both tweets (80) and (82) include upper case expressions
SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL, WON and CRAZY, and in all three, Trump takes a defensive
stance on specific aspects of his presidency. In (80), he dismisses the story on Russia
allegedly waging a sustained influence operation in support of Donald Trump’s 2016
campaign (Nussbaum 2017); in (81) he hits back at Todd for his reports on the preparatory
negotiations for the North Korea-U.S. summit of 2018 (Sang-Hun 2018); and in (82)
Trump reflects on his journey from presidential candidate to president and on his victory
in the 2016 election while attacking the Press – a term which presumably here refers to
hyper-partisan left news outlets and journalists.
Despite the evident similarities in the tweets, there are specific and
inconspicuous aspects in each post which disclose Trump’s different framing devices on
Twitter. (80) is an interrogative act and practically a directive, since Trump urges Todd
to start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake
Trump/Russia story. The question is very much rhetorical and is inherently a direct attack
on Todd and NBC News. Moreover, NBC News is tagged using a “@” symbol which, as
stated in the previous chapter, is uncommon in Trump’s mentions of the network.

In (81), Trump focuses on the relation between the U.S. and North Korea
and frequently uses the phrases we have and they have to explain his perception of the
situation in a decisive manner. He outlines the tweet with a report on Todd’s statement
which is that [The U.S.] have given up so much […] and they have given up nothing He
starts his counter-argument with the interjection Wow followed by a downright opposing
statement we haven’t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization. Twitter’s
280-character limit allows Trump to create such lengthy contrasting arguments in
conversation-like rhetoric.
Todd is addressed by his first name in (82) as Trump periphrastically points
his finger at him: Actually Chuck, they’ve been doing that sounds like the two are engaged
in an informal conversation and Trump initiates a sharp objection in response to his
opponent’s claims. This act implicates his dislike for Todd and is less polite in this
particular setting. Furthermore, Trump emphasizes his win in the 2016 presidential
election with upper case I WON and amusingly affirms that the Press [are] going CRAZY!
as a result.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this thesis has been to identify the different ways in which Donald Trump uses
language to frame news networks and media professionals on Twitter; I have attempted
to pinpoint the specific features of and patterns in my selection of tweets. The main
themes of Trump’s rhetoric on Twitter notably include the credibility of mainstream
media and political bias, which naturally means that these concepts are relevant in this
thesis as well. Because a significant measure of both studies is based on how political
bias among media conglomerates is illustrated in Trump’s tweets, I have allocated
fourteen news networks into different categories of political bias with the help of Ad
Fontes Media, AllSides and Media Bias/Fact Check.
I have analyzed 586 tweets quantitatively in Study 1 and chose 82 of those
tweets for Study 2, where I analyzed them individually and qualitatively. I have gathered
every tweet with the help of Trump Twitter Archive (TTA), a corpus containing virtually
all tweets from @realDonaldTrump. I have supported my analyses with various other
tweets which are included as footnotes; I have also referenced numerous tweets in Study
2 with relevant news articles in order to provide a context for the content of the tweets. I
intentionally restricted the timeframe of the data to exactly two years; all tweets in this

63

Robin Kullberg
study were posted between 20 January, 2017 and 20 January, 2019. The limitations
resulted in the exclusion of interesting events such as Trump’s meetings with North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2019 (Westcott 2019 & Taylor 2019), his alleged attempt
to purchase the country of Greenland (Dunn 2019), the impeachment (Fandos & Shear
2019), the effects of global COVID-19 pandemic (Baker & Kaplan 2020), and events
leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election (Phillips 2020). Furthermore, I have
ignored several topics on which Trump often commentates on Twitter, such as domestic
politicsz or his relationship with various foreign leaderså. Trump’s tweet ‘gaffes’, i.e.
instances of a typographic error in a tweet and a replacement post thereafter, are also an
interesting aspect of his use of social media, but such data belongs to a different study.
Moreover, I consider verbal attacks (not only on leftist media but in general) to be such a
prominent part of the rhetoric of @realDonaldTrump that they would require further
comprehensive research and examination. Lastly, I would like to stress that this thesis is
not an attempt to analyze or define Trump’s inherent ideologies, nor does it evaluate his
presidency, but it rather explains a part of it.
There are many conclusions to be drawn following the analyses of Donald
Trump’s tweets. First, as indicated in Figure 1 in 3.2, the distribution of news network
mentions by Trump is rather divergent: Trump mentions Fox News on Twitter far more
often than any other media outlet, which inherently is not astonishing. The data presented
in Study 1 and 2 demonstrates Trump’s affinity to it, and the main reason for this is not
too perplexing either: Fox News tends to report overwhelmingly in favor of Trump and
the Republican Party in comparison to other mainstream media networks (DellaVigna &
Kaplan 2007: 1189; Azari 2016: 678–679 & Grossmann & Hopkins 2018). During the
first two years of his presidency, Trump never once wrote a critical tweet about Fox News.
However, there were many different ways in which he praised and proclaimed it.
Trump arguably has a twofold view of what makes up the mainstream media
in the U.S.: the first part is Fox News which he approves of and strongly endorses, and
the second part comprises all news networks which he despises and regularly criticizes,
i.e. ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC and CNNä. This idea
is supported by how Trump frames partisan left news networks while comparing them to

Fox in (3), (4), (6) and (7). In such tweets, Trump uses terminology which emphases
competition. One way for Trump of promoting the alleged superiority of Fox News in his
tweets is by saying that they are winning, which is a highly trumpesque approach to affirm
his assertions. This behavior is one example of his obsession with triumph and success.
It can also be said that according to the data presented in Study 1, Trump does not actively
follow other partisan right news networks than Fox News.
Furthermore, Trump regularly refers to various approval rating polls to
either assert his own popularity or discredit an enemyö. Every instance of him thanking
the source of a poll which portrays him in a positive sense is inherently an act of
endorsement and promotion of himself. And in contrast, when he rejects a poll which
does not glorify him, he frames the source with expressions such as Fake News or
suppressionaa. Trump’s reactions to approval ratings on Twitter are often packed with
emotion. This is what Trump himself refers to as ‘truthful hyperbole’ and is a form of
exaggeration which serves as a powerful promotional tool (Trump & Schwartz 1987).
Trump’s love affair with Fox News is obvious in this context.
What characterizes Trump’s language use on Twitter is his repetitive use of
certain words. A large share of his most used terminology is listed in Table 1 and Table
2. It is a known fact that his rhetoric is quite simple and different from what is considered
‘normal’ in politics; it is also evident that his way of tweeting has massively changed the
appearance of political rhetoric on Twitter (Oborne & Roberts 2017). For instance, he is
fond of applying nicknames to people he criticizes.
The list of nicknames used by Trump to describe foes is long and diverse
(Schallhorn 2018), and only a handful have been mentioned in this study. Trump uses
monikers such as Crooked, Psycho, Low I.Q., Sleepy Eyes and Lyin’ to torment people
whom he dislikes; and he favors words such as Fake, Fraud and Failing to frame news
networks with which he mostly disagrees. Once he starts using a moniker, he continues
its usage in order to establish a memorable and lasting connection between the target and
their title. They are usually negative and disrespectful, and are often applied specifically
for one person or news network (Crooked Hillary, Crazy Bernie and Failing New York
Times)bb. Interestingly, Trump rarely refers to fellow-politicians or journalists by their

last or full name, but often instead by their first name along with a nickname, a practice
which suggests a lack of respect towards his targets or, at least, a lack of general
politeness.
Trump’s nicknames have developed into an essential part of his rhetoric –
not only on social media but in general – and could well be considered a rhetorical weapon
of sorts. They certainly are a totem of his presidency. However, he does not always use
them to criticize or ridicule, as seen in tweets (56), (57), (58) and (60), where journalists
Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity are called the great and Big ratings getter respectively. The
structure of how Trump frames friend and foe with a nickname is quite similar, but usually
when he uses a negative moniker, its first letter is capitalized as in Psycho Joecc, as
opposed to most positive ones. It is worth mentioning that sometimes Trump capitalizes
an adjective which has a positive or empowering quality such as Strongdd. The ultimate
effect of initial capitalization is that the expression has the appearance of a legitimate and
established term, rather than just a modifier; the influence of the actual words as such is
abundant. He uses such a powerful and forceful vocabulary to rattle, delegitimize,
embarrass and ultimately overthrow his enemies.
The results in Chapter 4 reveal a great deal about Trump’s personal values
and attractions. As said previously, one concept which he undoubtedly rates highly is that
of competition as well as general success and achievement. He has stressed his win (and,
perhaps more importantly, Clinton’s loss) in the 2016 presidential election continuously
throughout his presidencyee and considers political decisions to be unambiguously either
successful or poor. His heavy use of competition-terminology, such as win, lose and
success, attests to Trump’s passion for winning. Twitter is therefore a platform of selfpromotion for Trump, as he continuously assures himself and his followers of his own
competitiveness.
Trump’s affection for money is characteristic in his rhetoric in real life and
on social media. During his first two years as president, he mentioned money on 91
occasionsff, billion(s) on 121 occasionsgg, and various variants of the word economy 163

timeshh. He sometimes combines his favorite themes – competition and money – when
tweeting, as seen in (42): The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, which is a
direct comparison between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party based directly
on the acquirement of finances. This quote accurately portrays Trump’s manner of
asserting the superiority of his political party and crushing his opposition. In (31), he does
essentially the same thing by quoting a news headline, “Disability applications plunge as
economy strengthens”: the concealed message of the tweet is that as the economy
strengthens, Trump himself strengthens simultaneously, as he sees himself as the person
in charge of its development. In conclusion, Trump values competitiveness, success and
winning highly, and he applies his principles effectively in his language use on Twitter.
Many of Trump’s tweets feature informal language and conversation cues,
i.e. written text which resembles oral language. These linguistic components include
capitalized words, which Trump uses for emphasis and to indicate exclamation: It just
went to NUMBER ONE! in (61) is a prime example of such. Here it is used to highlight
one single expression, while in I said NEITHER, never used those terms on anyone,
including Jeff, and being a southerner is a GREAT thing from (70) it is for the effect of
accentuating two different extremities of meaning; NEITHER is used to deny said
allegations against Trump and GREAT changes the mood of the tweet to a more positive
one. Writing in all caps gives the reader the impression that the writer is shouting and that
the message is urgent.
In addition to capitalization, another typographical feature in Trump’s
tweets is orthographic lengthening, which appears in (3), (68) and fifteen other tweets
during the first two years of Trump’s presidencyii. This type of cue only occurs when he
puts emphasis on the word so, which means that its purpose is largely the same as that of
capitalized words. Whenever Trump expands the word so, he not only adds letters, but
emotion, to it, which arguably makes the word resemble a product of spoken language.
Steinmetz (2013) states that this is more common among young tweeters. In some
contexts of CMC, such as Twitter, the border between written and spoken language is
slender (Yates 1996: 29–31 & Puschak 2016). Trump also uses exclamation to stretch the
textual limits set by the written message and to make his rhetoric on Twitter resemble the
way he talks. This essentially means that Trump’s tweets are often quite speech-like and

it might just be another key reason for his liking to Twitter; it allows him to speak his
mind while not being held back by textual boundaries.
The way language is used on Twitter by ordinary users does indeed
resemble oral language and can be considered informal to an extent. Tweets often contain
everyday conventions which originate from CMC contexts, such as the aforementioned
conversation cues and emoji. More importantly, tweets usually feature an informal,
simple and speech-like discourse (Nordquist 2020); these descriptive details ultimately
characterize the Twitter vernacular. Trump’s use of Twitter arguably resembles what we
define as ordinary – his language is simple, his vocabulary is narrow, and the speech acts
he uses correspond to the general trends on Twitter – however, there are several things
which make his style of tweeting unique.
The first aspect is how Trump’s tweets are typically structured. Tweets (5),
(8), (30), (32), (60) and (68), for instance, feature a similar structure which he often uses
when framing news networks or journalists. He often starts with a personal reaction to
either a specific event or a subject in general, which can be a single interjection (Wow); a
short clause which sets up the theme and tone of the tweet (So funny! or Another false
story); an expression of gratitude (Thank you) or praise (Congratulations); a clause in
which Trump states his own action (I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of
me); or an imperative clause (Look what Fake ABC News put out). This recurring
linguistic feature and the sheer amount of reaction tweets in this context indicate that
Trump is likely to personally tweet as he watches the news.
The second part of a typical tweet by Trump is the mention, either with or
without a “@” symbol, of whomever he praises or attacks. Unsurprisingly, he prefers
tagging news outlets and journalists which he is fond of, as it increases the visibility of
the mentioned party. Thirdly, he often uses a descriptive framing device along with the
mention, such as in (7), where Fox is promoted as number one while CNN is negatively
framed as FAKE NEWS, and in (29), in which The New York Times and The Washington
Post are branded with their distinctive respective monikers the Failing and propaganda
machine for Amazon. In most cases Trump places the moniker in front of the target, which
he has done with most news networks, journalists or politicians which he has criticized
on Twitter. He also uses other framing devices: for instance, in (78), the key framing
expressions are Fake News and vicious and purposeful mistake. Trump effectively links
CNN to negative and forceful words to denigrate and diminish it. He consistently uses

68

Robin Kullberg
specific monikers for individual enemies which makes the mentions more personal and
particular; this is true regardless of political bias.
Finally, Trump frequently concludes his tweets with an exclamatory
evaluation or assessment. These types of clauses are, in a sense, also framing devices in
that they illustrate Trump’s take on a subject or a person, and they are essential for
conveying his emotion. A total of 68 (82.93%) tweets in Study 2 contain at least one
exclamation mark, and in most cases the tweet indeed ends with one. The concluding
evaluations Great show! and Working hard! in (1) and (8), respectively, are short, simple
and affirmative, and refer to the broadcasts of Fox News and the work he carries out as
president. The concluding phrases are usually short when the tone of the tweet is positive,
as seen in (55) and (59) which Trump finishes with TRUE! and Enjoy!, but also at times
when attacking someone, like in (32): Sad!. These short expressions are syntactically and
lexically trumpesque due to the fact that they reveal the meaning and attitude of Trump’s
message in a brief wording; they are almost like slogans for his social media persona.
The concluding evaluation is, somewhat ironically, a way for Trump to
make his tweets coherent to his audience. He is used to completing his message with a
punchy one-liner. He uses the same rhetorical measures in spoken language to support
his statements and to persuade the listener: he rarely engages in long, complex sentences
which include low-frequency words, but instead favors short clauses and short words.
The sentence They will both be out of business in 7 years! in (29) is inherently where
Trump expresses his opinion in the tweet and integrally frames the news networks in
question. He thus uses the exclamation mark consistently but variably as well.
The data in Study 2 reveals the qualitative differences in how Trump frames
different entities of mainstream media in the USA. Tweets (54) to (66) were mainly
positive in tone but there were a number of contrasts in the way the five journalists were
mentioned. For instance, as indicated before, Lou Dobbs has been called the great Lou
Dobbs on three occasions from January 2017 through January 2019, which suggests that
Trump emphases Dobbs’ character and personality. Also, in the case of Sean Hannity,
Trump designates the unique, though awkward, moniker Big ratings getter to the recipient
to express his admiration for Hannity’s professional accomplishments as a political
commentator. However, Tucker Carlson, Maria Bartiromo and Jesse Watters are not
given separate titles, but are instead somewhat moderately praised solely on the basis of
their work (and likely on the fact that they work at Fox News).

69

Robin Kullberg
The way Trump frames partisan-left media professionals is, in comparison,
more curious and multifaceted. Jim Acosta was the only journalist in 4.3.2 to receive
mixed framing from Trump, as he was called both Crazy and actually a nice guy, while
all other journalists in this category were unambiguously framed in a critical manner.
Trump has mostly used the former moniker to attack political opponentsjj Trump’s
attitude towards Bob Woodward, however, is peculiar; not a single tweet in this study
contained a direct assault on him, but Trump does criticize Woodward’s (2018) book on
numerous occasions and with comprehensive means. This result implies a respect towards
Woodward himself, because it is not how Trump usually frames journalists with whom
he disagrees. In contrast, when framing Joe Scarborough, Trump explicitly refers to him
and adopts multiple nicknames such as Crazy, Psycho, poorly rated and low ratings. This,
in turn, discloses his dislike for and lack of respect towards Scarborough.
Correspondingly, Chuck Todd of NBC has received numerous critical remarks from
Trump and has been consistently labelled Sleepy Eyes. However, describing Trump’s way
of framing journalists as “consistent” is problematic, as his conduct of attacking rarely
conform to a forthright pattern. It resembles random harassment at best.
I have now discussed my own conclusions following an extensive research
on Trump’s tweeting habits. Trump definitely has a simple view on what American
mainstream media consists of: Fox News and Fake News. On Twitter he tends to focus
on either self-promotion or discrediting his enemy, and he does so by using a carefully
crafted terminology which includes words from Tables 1 and 2 as well as the nicknames
which appear in Study 2. His language is often centered on competition and money – two
concepts which arguably are cornerstones of his own policies. Furthermore, he uses
Twitter much like an average user, given the speech-like features seen in many of his
tweets, such as expressive lengthening of vowels and capitalization of words. Trump
often structures his tweets by starting with a strong reaction which is followed by the
mention of either a friend or foe along with a framing device, and usually finishes a tweet
with strong exclamatory evaluation. Last, I have argued that while Trump follows a
number of patterns while tweeting, his attacks are in general seldom consistent, but
arbitrary and based on what he subjectively observes in the world of news.

Robin Kullberg
Based on the analysis of the nicknames appearing in Study 2 and on other
scholarly works, it seems apparent that there is indeed little regularity in Trump’s scheme
to frame his adversaries (Lee & Quealy 2016). He often amplifies and acclaims his friends
with cheerful assertives while promoting himself; and he starkly criticizes his foes to
defend himself. Donald Trump’s presidency is subversive, controversial and profoundly
Twitter-based. As Barack Obama was elected president, he was branded “The Social
Media President”, but following the presidency of Trump, it is apparent that he has given
this title a whole new meaning. He does not only use Twitter to speak through it, he uses
it to control mainstream media and to assert his political power; it is arguably one of his
most powerful tools as president. When he tweets, it is as though the audience or the
recipient do not matter – it is only Donald Trump who matters. He often hypocritically
accuses others of lying and enmity while publishing questionable, hostile and
controversial content on social media himself. Twitter is arguably a space in which he is
able to create a reality of his own and where he is free to express himself however he
wants; it is actually not too different to how average users tend to use social media.
Thanks to the aforementioned affordances and features of Twitter, he is able to create,
uphold and refine his own image as a strong and accomplished man via his language use
on social media, and he is able to, above all, denounce and attack anyone who opposes
him and his policies.

Swedish Summary – Svensk sammanfattning
“My use of social media is not Presidential – it’s
MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL”
En studie om hur Donald Trump tilltalar de etablerade medierna på Twitter

Inledning och bakgrund
Ett av Donald Trumps viktigaste maktmedel som president har onekligen varit den sociala
nätverkstjänsten Twitter. Han har använt den aktivt sedan 2015 inte bara för att främja
sin politiska karriär, utan också för att attackera och kritisera det han pekar ut som ”Fake
News Media” (Allcott & Gentzkow 2017: 212–213 & Hollinger 2018). Detta har gett
upphov till debatter och konflikter i USA gällande ideologier och politisk partiskhet bland
de etablerade medierna. Syftet med den här avhandlingen är att ta reda på hur Trump
framställer amerikanska nyhetsnätverk och journalister på Twitter samt vilka språkliga
element som vanligtvis förekommer i hans retorik på Twitter.
Användaren @realDonaldTrump skapades år 2009 och styrdes då
huvudsakligen av Trumps mediepersonal; idag är det han själv, Brad Parscale och Dan
Scavino som har hand om profilen (Chute 2019). Tweetar som Trump själv skriver
återspeglar hans muntliga språk, förmedlar ofta starka känslor över ett ämne eller en
händelse, är vanligen enkelt ur ett språkligt perspektiv och kan innehålla grammatik- och
språkfel (Puschak 2015). Enligt Ott (2017: 60–62) kräver Twitter enkelhet och främjar
spontanitet samt ohövlighet. Dessa kännetecken präglar Trumps retorik på Twitter.
Nätverkstjänsten begränsar nämligen s.k. tweetar till 280 tecken, vilket tillåter honom
oförhindrat publicera korta inlägg utan att behöva stå för sina inläggs konsekvenser och
reaktioner. I presidentvalet år 2016 nyttjade Trump sociala medier bevisligen mer
effektivt än sin motståndare Hillary Clinton och därför kan man argumentera för att
Twitter har banat vägen för Trumps presidentskap (Francia 2017). Han är nämligen väl
medveten om makten han besitter som aktiv ”Twitter-president” och att de etablerade
medierna reagerar på hans tweetar. Detta framgick ytterst tydligt då Trump skrev ”Despite
the constant negative press covfefe” på Twitter i maj 2017 och gjorde världen upprörd.
Han behöver följaktligen inte använda sig av traditionella medel som till exempel
hashtaggar för att öka sina tweetars synlighet.

Metoder och material
Avhandlingens två studier omfattar data från Trump Twitter Archive, en korpus som
består av alla tweetar som Donald Trump någonsin publicerat. Den första studien är en
kvantitativ analys med fokus på tabeller medan den andra studien är kvalitativ och
fokuserar på språkliga element i olika typer av tweetar. Tidsramen för insamlade data är
från den 20 januari 2017 till den 20 januari 2019, det vill säga Trumps två första år som
president. Under den här tiden publicerade Trump 5 435 tweetar, och 527 av dem har
inkluderats i den här undersökningen. Felaktiga eller olämpliga tweetar som korrigerats,
tweetar där två eller flera olika nyhetsnätverk eller journalister nämnts samt tweetar som
delats upp i två eller flera enskilda inlägg inverkar på den totala mängden tweetar.
De 527 tweetar som hör till den kvantitativa studiens första kategori är alla
de inlägg där Trump har nämnt ett nyhetsnätverk. Den andra kategorin består av 59
tweetar där han nämnt välkända journalister. Dessutom innehåller den här studien en
kvantitativ analys på Trumps mest frekventa ordförråd och de talhandlingar han använder.
Nyhetsnätverkens och journalisternas eventuella politiska partiskheter har kategoriserats
med hjälp av nätsidorna Ad Fontes Media, AllSides och Media Bias/Fact Check.
Den andra studien innehåller betydligt färre tweetar (82 stycken) som valts
ur den första studiens stoff. Studien fokuserar på talhandlingar och språkliga element från
ett kvalitativt perspektiv. I det här kapitlet är också kopplingar, det vill säga likheter och
skillnader, mellan olika sorters attacker och beröm viktiga.

Analys
Tabellen Figure 1 visar hur många gånger Donald Trump har nämnt de största
nyhetsnätverken i USA på Twitter under sina första två år som president. De första fem
nyhetsnätverken i tabellen är politiskt högerorienterade och har föga förvånande inga
kritiska omnämnanden av Trump. Avvikelsen i den här underkategorin är nyhetskanalen
Fox News, som Trump pratar om mest av alla medier. Jämförelsevis nämns de andra fyra
högerorienterade nyhetsnätverken i bara 13 tweetar sammanlagt. Av 211 omnämnanden
av Fox News är 46 stycken uttryckligen positiva. Tabellen visar också att Trump inte ofta
pratar om politiskt neutrala nyhetsnätverk, utan hans fokus ligger ofta på sådana
nyhetsnätverk som, till någon utsträckning, är politiskt partiska. Bara 4,6 % av 527
omnämnanden i Figure 1 omfattar neutrala nyhetsnätverk.

Trump

de vänsterorienterade medierna fler gånger än de högerorienterade och det totala antalet
73

Robin Kullberg
vänsterorienterade nyhetsnätverk som omnämns av Trump är högre: sju gentemot fem.
Fördelningen av hur många gånger de olika nyhetsnätverken förekommer i studien tyder
på att Trumps syn på massmedian i USA är uppdelad i två delar: Fox News och
vänsterorienterade medier främst bestående av ABC, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, NBC och CNN. Datamaterialet påverkas starkt av att Trump ofta
inkluderar flera olika vänsterorienterade nyhetsnätverk i en och samma tweet, vilket han
sällan gör då han nämner Fox News. Av de 279 omnämnanden av vänsterorienterade
medier är tre positiva, tio neutrala och 266 negativa. En tweet som ”So they caught Fake
News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes
& @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!” från 27 juni 2017 är ett vanligt
Trumpartat sätt att dra flera nyhetsnätverk över samma kam och kritisera dem med
stämpeln ”Fake News”.
Tabellerna Table 1–Table 4 visar ofta förekommande ord i Trumps Twitterretorik och de talakter som han använt då han tilltalat amerikanska nyhetsnätverk och
journalister. Orden i Table 1 och Table 2 är markanta eftersom de förekommer i de 82
tweetarna som valts till den kvalitativa studien och framställer teman och drag som
karakteriserar Trumps språkanvändning på Twitter.
Som sagt består den kvalitativa studien av 82 enskilda tweetar, av vilka 53
innehåller omnämnanden av ett eller flera nyhetsnätverk och 29 av journalister. Syftet
med denna studie är att lyfta fram, granska, analysera och förklara de kvalitativa
egenskaperna i tweetarna i fråga och därmed förtydliga resulaten i den kvantitativa
studien.
3. Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your
ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!

(5.2.2018)
Texten ovan är en av totalt 46 positivt laddade tweetar där Trump omnämner Fox News.
Här tackar han dem för att ha avslöjat sanningen och säger att deras tittarantal är mycket
högre än deras lögnaktiga motståndares. Denna tweet är ett exempel på hur Trump främjar
ett högerorienterat tv-bolag och starkt kritiserar flera vänsterorienterade nyhetsnätverk på
en gång. Han förlänger vokalen i so till soooo – ett drag som liknar talat språk – vilket
tyder på att han vill betona sitt misshag för vänstermedier och framhäva komplimangen
till Fox News (Steinmetz 2013).

27. So much Fake News being put in dying magazines and newspapers. Only

place worse may be @NBCNews, @CBSNews, @ABC and @CNN. Fiction
writers!

(17.10.2017)
28. The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased

AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast.
The “Fakers” at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest
reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!

(3.4.2018)
I de två tweetarna ovan diskuterar Trump ett flertal vänsterorienterade nyhetsnätverk. I
bägge tweetar använder han termerna Fake News och fiction (fiktion) för att attackera
dem, och den förstnämnda är, troligen inte slumpartat, skriven med versaler båda
gångerna. Det är ett uttryck som Trump definitivt har befäst i sin språkanvändning som
president. Utöver dessa använder han termer som ”döende”, ”sjuk”, ”partisk”,
”förfalskare” och ”oärlig” för att inte bara kritisera dem, men också för att försöka
utmärka hur han vill definiera dem. Dessa nyckelord är sådana som präglat Trumps
förhållande till de etablerade medierna. För övrigt är det viktigt att påpeka att Trump
taggar alla nyhetsnätverk med @-symbolen i den första tweeten från 2017 men gör det
inte i den andra tweeten som är postad nästan ett halvt år senare.
53. Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their
election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox

(20.3.2017)
I (53) använder Trump beteckningen Fake News för att attackera CNN och dess
opinionsundersökningar från 2016. Han kallar dem för en ”fullständigt felaktig katastrof”
vilket stärks i och med versaliseringen i WAY OFF och jämför CNN med Fox News, som
enligt Trump har ”ett mycket högre tittarantal”. Han skapar följaktligen igen en direkt
jämförelse mellan medier för att prisa en högerorienterad nyhetskanal och kritisera ett
vänsterorienterat nätverk. Han baserar jämförelsen på Fox News mätbara framgång
gentemot CNN:s misslyckande och orättfärdiga reportage (Kennedy et al. 2018).

Diskussion och sammanfattning
Donald Trumps syn på vad de etablerade medierna i USA består av är väldigt entydig:
Fox News och Fake News. Hans retorik på Twitter är ofta fokuserad på att befrämja och
hylla sig själv samt att förödmjuka och kritisera sina fiender. Tabellerna Table 1 och Table
75

Robin Kullberg
2 visar hurdan terminologi han ofta använder sig av och i den andra studiens tweetar visas
det exakt i vilka sammanhang han använder uttrycken. Det är tydligt att han använder
Twitter på ett likadant sätt som en vanlig användare, bland annat eftersom hans språk i
tweetar ofta liknar talat språk och vanligtvis innehåller hans tweetar hans åsikter eller
kommentarer om något specifikt ämne eller en viss händelse.
Trump strukturerar i allmänhet sina tweetar enligt följande: han börjar med
en stark reaktion eller direkt hänvisning till någon händelse (som ofta innehåller ett
utropsord), fortskrider med att nämna en person eller en institution som han
sammankopplar till någon beteckning som t.ex. Fake News eller Psycho, och avslutar med
en bedömning som i sin tur visar vad Trump menar med tweeten. Tweeten (26) är ett
praktiskt exempel på hur Trump uttrycker sig på Twitter. Trots detta är hans tweetar sällan
varken sammanhängande eller konsekventa (Lee & Quealy 2016). Hans presidentskap är
definitivt kontroversiellt och i stor grad Twitter-baserat, eftersom han använder Twitter
inte bara för att gynna sin egen image och kritisera sina fiender, utan också för att hålla
fast vid makten över de etablerade medierna samt skapa en värld där han obehindrat kan
säga vad som helst om sig själv och öppet kritisera sina motståndare utan motsägelser.

Nov 23, 2018 07:57:18 AM Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major
bipartisan support. @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @senchuckschumer have a real
chance to do something so badly needed in our country. Already past, with big vote, in
House. Would be a major victory for ALL! [Twitter for iPhone]

a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me! [Twitter for iPhone]

Jan 9, 2019 09:36:05 AM Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest
