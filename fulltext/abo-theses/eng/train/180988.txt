Abstract
In this master’s thesis, the focus was on non-competitive immunometric assays. The purpose of this
work was to develop a prototype of a fluidic analysis method based on modern immunoassays. In
this work, a synthetic human serum was used for the detection of labelled antibodies directed to
the Placental Growth Factor antigens. The developed fluidic method utilizes carboxylated latex
beads as a carrier material for the conjugated antibodies instead of plastic well plates. Luminescent
upconversion nanoparticles, in turn, were used to detect the signal from the PlGF antigen.

Svensk sammanfattning
I detta examensarbete stod fokus på icke-kompetitiva immunometriska analyser. Immunometriska
analyser används för detektion och kvantifiering av olika antigenanalyter. Syftet med detta
examensarbete var att utveckla en mikrofluidistisk prototyp av en analysmetod baserad på Wallac
Oys tvåskikts immunometrisk analys i fast fas. Mikrofluidistiksystem fungerar genom att använda
en pump som transporterar en vätska inuti ett mikrofluidistik-chip med varierande
luftflödeshastighet. I samband med mikrofluidistiska immunanalyser minskar den lilla provmängden
på diffusionsavståndet vilket tillsammans med stor bindande yta av ett stort antal små latexpärlor
gör bindningsreaktioner snabbare. Skalning av immunanalysen ned med mikrofluidistiska
filtreringskretsar minskar också på reagens- och provförbrukningen.
I detta arbete konstruerades och optimerades en mikrofluidistisk immunanalysmetod för en specifik
analyt, antigenen placentaltillväxtfaktor (PlGF). Den utvecklade fluidistiska analysmetoden
använder sig av karboxylerade latexpärlor som bärarmaterial för de konjugerade antikropparna
istället för plastbrunnsplattor. Luminescerande nanopartiklar för uppkonvertering användes i sin tur
för att detektera signalen från PlGF. Prover med olika partikelstorlekar testades för att undersöka
variablernas påverkan och beteende samt produktens prestanda. De COOH-belagda
polystyrenpärlorna som användes i detta arbete varierade från 10 till 20 μm till sin storlek.
Syftet med anordningen var att använda tryckluft för att transportera vätskor, både från
provbehållaren och tvättbuffertbehållaren, med samma flödeshastighet till filterplattan.
Immunoassayn som utvecklades under arbetet genererade ett vätskeflöde till filtreringsområdet där
provet samlades in. Enheten bestod av flera mindre enheter och processer, vilka alla utvecklades
separat; tryckluftstillförsel, ventilstyrning, programmering, tillsats av prov- och tvättlösning,
inkubationsområdet och filtreringsområdet.
Ett halvautomatiserat system för provinkubation utvecklades också. Uppvärmningen och
inkubationen var både datorstyrd. Inkubationssystemet kan användas för att optimera inkubationsoch flödeshastigheter för alla vätskor.

1. Introduction
The purpose of this Master’s Thesis work was to develop a prototype of a fluidic analysis
method based on Wallac Oy’s solid phase, two-site immunometric assay. Immunometric
assays are used for detection and quantitation of different antigen analytes. Microfluidics
systems work by using a pump moving a liquid inside a microfluidic chip with varying air flow
rates. Inside the chip, there are microfluidic channels that process the liquid. The liquid may
carry tiny particles such as cells or nanoparticles. In the context of microfluidic
immunoassays, small sample scale decreases diffusional distances increasing the binding
surface area and allows binding reactions to occur faster. Scaling the fluidic immunoassay
down with a microfluidic filtration chip also alleviates reagent and sample consumption.
In this work, the microfluidic immunoassay was designed and optimized for a specific
analyte, placental growth factor (PlGF). The analysis method utilizes antibody-coated
microbeads to detect and bind to the analyte and upconverting nanoparticle labels to
characterize the antibody-antigen interactions directly from the serum sample. The assay
platform separates, washes, and concentrates antibody-coated microbeads from an excess
label to produce a signal response proportional to the amount of PlGF antigen in the sample.
The assay was sought to achieve a readout without sample preparation beyond mixing and
loading of the reagents. Demonstration of the accuracy of the device over a large dynamic
range is also presented in this work.
A semi-automated system for sample incubation was also developed. The heating and
incubation during the incubation were computer controlled. The incubation system can be
used to optimize the incubation and flow rates for any fluids.
This Master’s thesis was divided into different chapters. Chapter 2 provides essential and
general information about immunoassays, antibodies and antigens, method sensitivity, and
interference factors. Chapter 3 deals with bead-based immunoassays, the formulation and
coating of beads, as well as an overview of microfluidic immunoassays and photon
upconversion in more detail. Chapter 4 presents the practical part and results of the work.
Chapter 5 summarizes the conclusions as well as the reflection. Finally, chapter 6 contains
the references and chapter 7 more detailed information to support the interpretation of the
results.

2. Background
Immunoassays are based on generating a signal from a target analyte in a sample.
Immunoassays involve binding the antigen to a solid surface instead of an antibody. The
reaction can occur in solution or on a solid surface. The signal can, for example, be
proportional to the amount of antigen in the sample; the more antigen, the higher signal is
obtained. The advantages of immunoassays are high sensitivity and specificity. There are two
main types of immunoassays – competitive and non-competitive assays. In a competitive
assay, a sample and labelled antibody compete for a specific antibody binding site. In noncompetitive assays, the analyte in the sample binds directly to the antibody attached to the
surface and the labelled antibody binds to another epitope of the analyte, i.e. the part of the
antigen molecule that the immune system recognizes and responds to. (1)
Many of these assays are designed e.g. for blood or fluid samples. Immunoassays become
more effective when the target analyte is large enough with enough surface area to
accommodate two different antibodies. Antibodies are the key factor in immunoassays.
Selection of the most suitable and specific antibody with the highest affinity requires
detailed background research. To optimize immunoassays, the aim of labelling should focus
on minimizing the need of modifying the binding region of the labelled molecules. In
immunoassays, a measurable signal is obtained, e.g. discoloration or light emission.
Commonly used label molecules are enzymes, radioisotopes, and various fluorescent
fluorophores. (1) The development of new analysis methods is also under constant work,
because more sensitive, faster, and more cost-effective devices and methods are desired.
The ability to test multiple analytes simultaneously is termed multiplexing. This technology
utilizes differentially dyed and functionalized beads to detect and quantify analytes in
multiplex from the same sample offering a broad range of biomolecules to be assayed. The
configuration of an assay consists of a suspension array where specific capture moieties
covalently couple to the surface of dyed microbeads. The binding reaction takes place on the
surface of the microbead forming an array. Analyte binding is detected by utilizing spectrally
compatible fluorophores. (1 p. 157)

2.1 Immunoassays
Antibodies (Ab), also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are large, Y-shaped proteins circulating
in the vascular system. Antibodies are used to identify and bind like a lock and key to foreign
compounds such as viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Antibodies also create a basis of the analyte
molecule detection in biological immunosystems by recognizing foreign invading microorganisms by binding the pathogen’s antigens or proteins. Antibodies can also form a
sandwich structure around the target analyte and, therefore, these immunoassays are called
immunometric sandwich assays. These assays are designed to detect different antibodies in
e.g. blood or human serum samples. (1 p. 7) Immunometric assays utilize the ability to
capture antibodies to recognize the target analyte that is most commonly an antigen.
Antigens are compounds or molecules causing an immune response in the body. Also, a
second detecting antibody, specific for the other site of the antigen, is used as a label. The
efficient removal of the unbound-labelled antibodies is a critical part of the assay to detect
the target antigen. Failure to completely remove the unbound antibody will result in high
background signal. This assay is better known as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA, fig 1.). In a sandwich ELISA, two different antibodies are used to form a sandwich
complex around a target analyte, with one antibody capturing the target and the other,
being labelled, is able to generate a signal directly proportional to the target analyte
concentration. In non-competitive immunochemical assays, the antigen must be polyvalent
with multiple epitopes in order to bind both capture and labelled antibodies. (1 pp. 7-8)

antigen. (d) Secondary antibody is added, and it binds to the sandwich complex. (e) Developing solution added for enzyme
reaction. Excess antibodies also need to be removed for optimal results. (modified from the source 3)

Immunometric assays also utilize a large excess of antibody-binding sites compared to the
concentration of target analyte. Immunometric assays may also be designed to detect
antibodies instead of antigens by using an antigen as an inducement. Immunometric
applications are commonly used to detect specific infectious diseases. (1 pp. 7-8)
Enzymes are proteins that can bind to specific target molecules and, in some cases, generate
colour. Enzyme labels with appropriate substrate may also create fluorescence or
luminescence and therefore they behave the same way as antibodies.

2.2 Antibody-antigen interaction kinetics
The interaction between antigen and the target analyte at single antigenic sites can be
described by the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. There are four types of forces that
promote binding: Hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals forces and
hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interactions are the major force for antibodyantigen reactions, and they are based on repulsion of water by nonpolar groups rather than
on attraction of molecules. Attractive interactions occur between non-polar residues of the
antibody and the antigen due to dispersion forces. (2)
A lack of steric factor (probability of molecules colliding with the right positioning and
orientation to achieve desirable geometry) between the binding sites of antibody and
antigen is also important among the repulsive forces and prevents an approach of the two
molecules necessary for the weak, attractive forces to be effective. Immunometric assays
involve a binding reaction between at least one antibody and antigen. This reaction may take
from a few seconds to several hours to achieve equilibrium – condition of a system in which
all competing influences are balanced. For example, pH, ionic strength, and temperature
affect the time to reach the equilibrium state. (3)
Chemical bonds are based on attraction forces between, for example, ions or molecules that
enable the formation of chemical compounds. Van der Waals forces are the weakest, but
they involve all kinds of molecules. In turn, hydrogen and ion-dipole bonds require
oppositely charged atoms. Hydrogen bonds are essential e.g. in aqueous solutions because
water easily forms strong hydrogen bonds. All antigen-antibody bindings are reversible and
follows the basic thermodynamic principles of reversible bimolecular interactions. (5)
The antigen-antibody reaction may be simplistically described by the Law of Mass Action (eq.
1 and 2). At the beginning, the chemical reaction proceeds in one direction but the reverse
rate progressively increases until both the forward and reverse rates are equal. At this point,
the components are balanced, and the reaction has reached its equilibrium and the ratio
between the concentrations of the formed complex and reactants (Ab and Ag) is constant.

[Ag] = Molar concentrations of free binding sites on the antibody
[Ab] = Molar concentrations of free binding sites on the antibody
[Ag – Ab] = Concentration of antigen-antibody complex
Ka = Association rate constant
Kd = Dissociation rate constant
Ke = Equilibrium constant

The association rate constant (Ka) describes the rate of complex formation, i.e. the number
of antigen-antibody complexes formed per second in one molar solution of antigen and
antibody. The units of association rate constant are M -1 s-1 and are typically 1 ּ 103 – 1 ּ 107 in
biological systems. (4) In turn, the dissociation rate constant (Kd) describes the stability of
the complex, i.e. the fractionation per second. The unit of dissociation rate constant is s-1
and is typically between 1 ּ 10-1 and 1 ּ 10-6 in biological systems. Kd is often presented as the
unit of concentration. Keq is the equilibrium constant, and it is also equal to the ratio between
the association rate constant and the dissociation rate constant. (3)

Example: Kd of 1 x 10-2 s-1 = 0.01 s-1 indicates 1 percent decay of the complexes per second.
(4)

It is relevant to note that if the antibody detection is increased, the ratio between bound
complex and antigen should be increased by either increasing the equilibrium constant or
the antibody concentration. The equilibrium constant value is directly proportional to the
strength of the bond. (3)

2.3 Assay sensitivity and specificity
Assay specificity describes the ability of antibodies to produce measurable response only for
the analyte of interest. Immunoassays are analytical tools consisting of several fundamental
characteristics. (5) In quantitative immunoassay measurements, the signal correlates
progressively with the analyte concentration. The phenomenon occurs because the number
of labelled antibody bonds correlates proportionally to the amount of the analyte.
Quantitative immunoassays require a standard curve to estimate the concentration of an
analyte from the signal generated, meaning that measured concentrations are compared
against the standard or calibration curves. Standard curves can be created by including
dilutions of a solution with a known concentration of analyte and generated from precalibrated solutions. (1 p. 11) Values for calibration curves are not necessarily reliable. In
such a case (fig. 2), assessment of measurement precision in an analytical technique requires
the measurement with discrete and variable concentrations using defined solutions.
Precision describes the repeatability of the analytical technique. (1 pp. 12-13)

Figure 2. Analytical sensitivity – fitted calibration curve versus true sensitivity. In the figure, the actual sensitivity does not
correspond to the calculated sensitivity. However, the calculated sensitivity gives an indication of what the results could be.

Non-competitive immunoassays have been more sensitive than competitive assays
measuring the analyte-bound sites. Competitive assays, in turn, determine the analyteunbound site. The common feature of these assays is the reaction of analyte versus excess
number of antibodies. Excess antibodies promote the antigen-antibody reaction; hence, the
antibody can efficiently capture and even trace small amounts of antigen. This explains why
the non-competitive immunoassays are more sensitive than the competitive immunoassays.
(6) Typical dose-response standard curves of competitive immunoassays and noncompetitive immunoassays are presented in figure 3. (7)

Figure 3. Typical dose-response standard curves of competitive immunoassays and non-competitive immunoassays. The
black curve indicates high concentration analytes with positive correlation and the green curve negative correlation with
low concentration analytes. (Modified from the source 8)

The resulting antibody-antigen bonds, whose quantity is usually proportionally related to
the amount of the specific analyte, are determined from coexisting free antibodies and
antigens. Thus, the non-competitive assays measure the analyte-bound sites, while the
competitive assays determine the analyte-unbound sites. The signal intensity is also
proportional to the amount of analyte, as shown in the dose-response curve in figure 3. Noncompetitive immunoassays have additional advantages, including, higher precision and
wider working range, both of which are due to the use of excess antibodies. (6)

2.4 Interference
The presence of interfering agents in a sample matrix can cause erroneous test results. These
errors might lead to e.g. misdiagnosis and fatal consequences for the patient (1 p. 405).
There is no single procedure that can rule out all interferences. The specificity of an
immunoassay is not only dependent on the binding property of the antibody, but also the
composition of the antigen and its matrix. Analyte-dependent interferences in
immunoassays are usually caused by interactions between components in the sample matrix
with one or more reagent antibodies. These components are e.g. heterophilic antibodies,
human anti-animal antibodies, and other proteins. The extent of the interfering effect
depends on the concentration of the interferant, but it is not always directly proportional.
(6)
Four different interferences in immunometric assays are presented in figure 4: an assay
without any interference (a), cross-reactivity of an interfering substance with capture
antibody resulting in false-negative result (b), a change of sterical conformation after binding
of interfering protein to fragment of detector antibody reduces the rate of a chemical
reaction (c), blocking of the epitope on an analyte surface by an interfering protein of the
sample (d). The site of an antigen that locates on the surface receptor that is bound by an
antibody molecule is called the antigenic determinant or an epitope. (6)

Figure 4. Different interferences in immunometric immunoassays. (a) Assay without interference. (b) Interfering agent
resulting false result. (c) A steric hindrance. (d) Blocking of the analyte. (Modified from the source 6)

Many commercial immunometric assays include blocking agents to eliminate the
interference. The simplest way to verify the results of an immunometric assay is to perform
linear dilution series outside the reference scale. Antibody dilutions do not typically act
linearly and, therefore, dilution ratios with large concentration differences are commonly
used. (1 pp. 409-410).

18
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

As mentioned earlier in the text, in a perfect immunometric assay there would not be a signal
in the absence of an antigen. However, there is always some signal, principally arising from,
for example, the instrument itself, the signal due to non-specific adsorption and crossreactivity. Cross-reaction is a challenging problem in immunoassays, in which endogenous
molecules with a similar construction towards the target analyte or metabolites of the
analyte have common cross-reacting epitopes and structural similarity. (7) Because many
proteins have closely related structures, evaluation of antibody cross-reactivity is necessarily
the first stage in assay design (1 pp. 15-17). If the cross-reacting agent is added to the
analyte-free matrix, a signal increase is obtained only if the analyte binds to both antibodies,
as shown in figure 5.

Figure 5. Expression of cross-reactivity. (Modified form the source 1 pp. 15-16)

The absence of signal may imply that the substance is not cross-reacting. The cross-reacting
substance may also bind to the capture antibody, the second detecting antibody, or both. If
the cross-reacting substance binds to the first capture antibody, but not to the detecting
antibody, the measured concentration decreases causing a negative interference.
If the cross-reacting agent binds to both, the first and the second antibody, the resulting
signal increases by a positive interference (1 pp. 15-17). Measurements of an antibody
response to substances other than an analyte are usually defined at the point where the
reduction in the signal corresponds to 50% of the signal achieved in the absence of an analyte
(Bound/B0 of 50%, fig. 5), as a percentage of the target analyte concentration, giving the
same fall in the signal. (1 pp. 15-16)

Agglutination is defined as the formation of particle clumps. For example, the clumping of
red cells might cause blood to sediment. Agglutination usually occurs in two stages: a specific
combination of an antibody with antigen on the surface of an antigen and the formation of
visible aggregates of the particles. Agglutination is also influenced by factors including ionic
strength, temperature, and viscosity. (8)
One common phenomenon in one-step immunometric assays is called the Hooks effect. This
effect is caused by extremely high concentrations of analyte saturating both capture and
detector antibodies. This phenomenon is caused by relatively large numbers of antibody
molecules versus antigen particles, which leads to the decrease of antigen-antibody
complexes, respectively. It can be seen in figure 6 that the formation of antigen-antibody
complexes stops increasing with higher concentrations and decreases with extremely high
concentrations creating a hook-shaped graph. An important relevance of the phenomenon
results false negatives and inaccuracy of the assays. (6)

Figure 6. A high-dose Hooks effect - an excessive amount of analyte overwhelms the binding capacity of the capture
antibody. The effect occurs when both the capture and detection antibodies become saturated by the high analyte
concentration. There is no sandwich formed and free antigen competes with captured antigen for detecting antibody
binding. (Modified from the source 6)

3. Bead-based immunoassays
The principle of bead-based assays does not significantly vary from conventional
immunoassays. Individual beads are coated with a capture antibody specified for one
analyte. The captured analyte from a sample is detected using an analyte-specific-labelled
antibody, which binds to the appropriate epitope of the immobilized analyte, and a sandwich
structure is formed. In bead-based assays, antigen-antibody reactions are induced on the
surface of the bead in the solution and the binding event of the antigen-antibody is
monitored by labelling of a secondary antibody. Bead size and optimal bead diameter affect
the resulting complex. Each micro- or nanobead is given a unique surface region, allowing
differentiation of one bead from another (fig. 7). (9) The microbead-based technology in
assay formats is divided into microbead-based multiplex nucleic acid assay formats and
microbead-based multiplex immunoassays (10).
Two particle types are used in bead-based immunoassays: magnetic and non-magnetic
particles (10). Magnetic and non-magnetic particles are both spherical, but their chemical
and physiological properties differ from one another. The magnetic tendency might lead
beads to sediment in the solution because of their higher density. Thus, constant mixing is
required during the analysis to ensure that beads remain evenly dispersed. Common
materials for non-magnetic microbeads used in heterogeneous microfluidic immunoassays
are polystyrene and glass. Magnetic beads are easy to manipulate by a magnetic field and
allow easy separation of target analytes from the reaction mixture. (11)

Figure 7. Polystyrene microbead architecture. The polystyrene core is surrounded by a polymer. The surface of the microsized bead is porous and irregular. Magnetic beads have an additional layer of magnetite within the polymer layer. (Modified

Figure 8. The bead-based immunoassay utilizes nano- or microbeads as solid material for the capture antibody. The capture
antibody is first conjugated to beads. The capture antibody detects the added analyte. The labelled marker is then bonded
to the analyte creating the basis for the signal generation. Comparing bead-based immunoassay to the conventional
immunoassay, bead-based immunoassay utilizes micro- or nanosized beads as a carrier material instead of well plates.
(Modified from the source 10)

Bead-based immunoassays (fig. 8) allow a quantitative and qualitative analysis method of
multiple target analytes with a combination of several features, including rapid data
acquisition, sensitivity and specificity, and multiplexed analysis. Nano- and microbeads have
been utilized to reduce the sample volume, expedite assays, improve the limit of detection,
and facilitate assay integration. Bead-based assays can also take various formats and for
example surface coverage assays have gained significant research interest because those
assays can be sensitive, fast, and readily implemented in microfluidics for point-of-care
diagnostics. (12) The particle size related to the binding area is presented in figure 9.

Figure 9. The particle size is related to the binding area. If the surface area of larger particles is compared to smaller
particles in constant total volume, the binding area is significantly larger in the structure to the right, consisting of a large
number of small particles (13)

3.1 Formulation and coating
Carboxylated beads are negatively charged and stabilized colloidal microparticles. These
beads are produced by polymerization under controlled conditions that induce spontaneous
coalescent bead formation.
The suspensions are composed mainly of water with small amounts of surfactant, sodium
bicarbonate, and potassium sulphate. Typically, the surface modification with carboxyl
groups improves the colloidal stability of the bead dispersion and prevents particle
aggregation. (14) There are several methods of attaching biological ligands to beads, such as
passive adsorption, covalent coupling, and affinity binding (15).
Passive adsorption is based on hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interactions.
Hydrophobic interactions occur between the hydrophobic portions of the adsorbed ligands
and the polymeric surface of the beads to form a conjugate. (14) The antibody is added in
excess to ensure the complete coverage of the surface of the bead. During adsorption, the
ligand of interest is attached to the surface of the bead by incubating for a fixed amount of
time. Because different impurities will compete with a ligand for space on the particle
surface, maximum ligand adsorption requires the use of pure reagents. If the concentration
of impurities is very high, it will become the principal coating of the particle. (9) Excess
antibody remaining in solution is removed via centrifugation or filtration after the
conjugation (3). The priority is that ligands, whose attachment is partly ionic, are affected by
the conditions of the environment in which they are suspended: pH changes, ionic strength,
a charge of the absorbent surface, and nature of proteins all affect the affinity of the protein.
The pH of the adsorption buffer is kept near the pH of the protein. (16)
Covalent bonding results in the permanent attachment of the molecule to the functionalized
bead (fig. 10). Water-soluble carbodiimide coupling agents, such as EDAC ((1-ethyl-3-(3dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide)) can be used with carboxylate modified beads to
covalently link ligands directly through primary amine groups on the ligand. The efficiency
of EDAC-mediated coupling can be increased in the presence of Sulfo-NHS. (17)

Figure 10. Covalent Coupling – Carboxylate-Modified beads. Covalent coupling is based on the formation of a single covalent
bond between the bead surface and the molecule. (18)

23
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

Nonspecific binding is a common problem in immunometric assays. The ionic strength of the
used buffer should be as low as possible, especially when beads have a low charge density
or if beads are relatively small. Since anionic beads are very sensitive to low concentrations
of multivalent cations, calcium and magnesium salts should be avoided, if possible. In
general, the smaller the size of these particles is, the more critical are these requirements –
e.g. very small beads have fewer charge groups for stabilization. (15)
The most common nonspecific binding problems are a result of hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions. Problems may be caused by charge-based interactions, i.e. a
positively charged molecule attracted to a negatively charged bead surface. To minimize
unwanted nonspecific bindings, the bead is coated with a large macromolecule, such as a
protein, which reduces nonspecific binding by blocking the hydrophobic or charged binding
sites on the bead surface. To avoid nonspecific adsorption of further proteins beads can be
coated with albumin, gelatine, or other macromolecules. These substances will fill in the
remaining hydrophobic areas on the beads. If the application of the coated beads is such
that detergents can be tolerated, a non-ionic surfactant like Tween 20 can be added to
increase the hydrophilicity of the particles. (19)

3.2 Microfluidic Immunoassays
Microfluidics is a field of science dealing with microscopic liquids and gas flows. Microfluidic
systems are referred to as lab-on-a-chips, biochips, or micro-total-analysis-systems
envisioned as miniaturized versions of their large-scale counterparts traditionally performed
in a laboratory. The advantages of lab-on-a-chip systems include less sample and reagent
consumption, reduced risk of contaminations, enhanced sensitivity, decreased costs, lower
power consumption, and higher reliability. Despite the advantages, there are limitations,
such as bubble formation and dead volume in microfluidic chips that need to be addressed.
The bubble formation disrupts the continuity of the liquid flow and may result in poor
performances. In the microscale environments, a dead volume might also cause serious
contaminations and hence poor results. (11) A generic illustrative image of a microfluidic
filter plate is presented in figure 11.

Figure 11. Microfluidic chips are usually transparent and have internal microchannels separated by thin walls connected to
the outside. Microchannels could be complex networks or straight lines. There are also holes called inlet or outlet ports
which allow the sample to be loaded and collected.

24
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

A microfluidic chip is a set of micro-channels molded into a glass, silicon, or polymer material.
Polymers, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are recommended materials because of
their relatively low cost, simple fabrication process, and biocompatibility. Liquid transport in
microfluidic immunoassays controls the flow of the sample. The micro-channels forming the
microfluidic chip transport are connected to achieve the desired features i.e. pumping or
mixing of the sample. (20) The sample liquid is injected and removed from the microfluidic
chip through tubing or syringe adapters with e.g. pressure controller or syringe pump. The
process in immunoassays usually includes labour-intensive and time-consuming series like
washing, mixing, and incubation. (21) Microfluidic platforms simplify these procedures,
reduce the assay time and sample/reagent consumption, and enhance the reaction
efficiency. The properties of substrate materials are presented in table 1. There are also
hybrid microfluidic devices providing advantages attributed to their component materials.
(11)
Table 1. Properties of the most common materials used in fabrication of a microfluidic device. (11)

Microfluidic immunoassays have gained importance as point-of-care testing. Microfluidics
technology provides an opportunity to manipulate small amounts of liquids using
microchannels. Liquid transport in microfluidic immunoassays affects the assay results.
Several approaches come along with on-chip liquid transport in microfluidic immunoassays
such as electroosmotic, pneumatic, centrifugal, piezoelectric, electrowetting, and
thermopneumatic. A comparison of liquid transport methods and external power sources,
valve integration, and flow rates for each pumping method is listed in table 2.

Figure 12. A schematic illustration of a microfluidic immunoassay. (a) The assay is performed in a capillary by controlling
the solution flow with a syringe pump. A filter is used to keep the antibody-coated beads at the incubation area to capture
target analytes and secondary antibodies. After incubation, the beads are pumped out for signal readout. (b) The incubation
zone consists of a filter and an adaptor. The right capillary is connected to a sample solution reservoir and the left is
connected to a syringe pump. (22)

The schematic illustration of microfluidic bead-based immunoassay is presented in figure 12.
The assay consists of a syringe pump, a syringe, an incubation area, and two capillaries. In
the incubation area, a filter and an adapter are connected to two capillaries at both sides. In
microfluidic bead-based immunoassay, the solution flow can be controlled by the capillary
with the syringe pump. (22)
Microfluidic platforms utilize optical, electrochemical, or mechanical read-outs. In
microfluidic immunoassays, specific antibodies are present in solution or attached to the
surfaces of the microfluidic channels. Aside from the cost advantages of consuming fewer
reagents, using smaller volumes accelerates the binding reactions by minimizing the distance
needed for analyte-reagent diffusion and increase the sensitivity of an assay. (23)

3.3 Photon upconversion of nanoparticles in immunoassays
Photon upconversion is a reverse process compared to conventional fluorescence. In
conventional fluorescence, one higher energy photon (usually UV) is absorbed, some energy
is lost, and a lower energy photon is emitted. In photon upconversion, the absorption of
several sequential low-energy photons is followed by the emission of one high-energy
photon at visible wavelengths. (24) Nanoparticles (NPs) are particles with an average
diameter below 100 nanometres. NPs allow opportunities in the development of healthcare
research e.g. bioimaging and particles are utilized as platforms in the development of
bioanalytical methods. (24)
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are inorganic materials containing lanthanide ions
(ytterbium (Yb3+) sensitizer ion and erbium (Er3+) activator ion) capable of converting lowenergy excitation light into high-energy visible light. UCNPs` use extends in the field of
biophotonics and nanomedicine for ultrasensitive biosensing, cancer therapy, and
diagnostics. (18) Figure 13 illustrates how the ytterbium ion absorbs the NIR photon and
transfers the energy to Er3+, which stores the energy in a long lifetime intermediate energy
state. This allows the second NIR photon to arrive and transfer the energy to a higher energy
state, after which a single high-energy visible light photon is emitted. (24)

Figure 13. (a) Energy level diagrams in conventional fluorescence and photon upconversion. In conventional fluorescence,
one higher energy photon is absorbed, and a lower energy photon is emitted. In photon upconversion, the absorption of NIR
photons is followed by the emission of only one high-energy photon. (25) (b) A general depiction of nanoparticle
architecture. These are anti-Stokes-type materials. The materials absorb infrared radiation and emit in the visible spectrum.
(26)

In figure 13, a general depiction of the active core of a nanoparticle architecture shows the
absorption of excitation light which is usually near-infrared (NIR). The Yb3+-rich shell is
represented in brown and the following energy transfer to the Er 3+ / Yb3+ doped core is
represented in green. Upconverted elements emit certain colours when an electron drops

27
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

from a high energy state to a low energy state. These colours are presented as blue, green,
and red, respectively. (26)
Comparing to a conventional fluorescence, in which photons are simultaneously excited in
normal fluorochrome, upconversion is a stepwise process that occurs through real electronic
states. NIR excitation demonstrates advantages over traditional UV excitation being less
harmful, low autofluorescence, and deep penetration in various tissues. Photoluminescence
properties, decay time, illumination time, brightness, and lifetime allow i.e. a tunable
wavelength. (24)
UCNPs are made of non-/low-toxic materials and low-cost materials and have the capacity
to connect with more ligands or functional groups (26). Surface functionalization of UCNPs
can be classified as originating from either the organic capping ligands or from the formation
of an inorganic shell layer surrounding the particle. Many surface modification,
functionalization, and bioconjugation strategies of colloidal inorganic NPs exist and the most
common surface functionalization techniques that impart aqueous solubility and
functionality to UCNPs are i.e. ligand exchange, ligand oxidation, and ligand absorption
(functional group could be for example a reactive moiety of carboxylic acid or NHS ester).
NPs are typically covered by ligands that prevent the aggregation of the particle cores. These
ligands are removable by, for example, excessive washing or the presence of another ligand.

Carboxylated latex beads were prepared by following and modifying the NHS and SulfoNHS activation reaction protocol from Thermo Scientific™ (27). The purpose was first to
prepare amine-reactive esters of carboxylate groups for labelling and crosslinking.
Carboxylates (-COOH) were reacted to Sulfo-NHS in the presence of a carbodiimide (EDC)
resulting in a semi-stable Sulfo-NHS ester, which was then reacted with the immobilizing
capture antibody to form amide crosslinks (fig. 14). Sulfo-NHS was added to enhance
coupling efficiency.

Figure 14. Reactions involving EDC, including activation as a Sulfo-NHS ester. EDC reacts with carboxylic acid groups
forming an active o-acylisourea intermediate. EDC also couples NHS to carboxyls and forms an NHS ester considerably
more stable than the O-acylisourea intermediate. The addition Sulfo-NHS increases conjugation efficiency. (27)

First, 1 ml of 10mg/ml bead solution was prepared to 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube. Then, the
storing solution (Vtot = 1.0 ml) was changed from pure water to activation buffer (0.1 M
MES, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 6.0). After that, 100 ml of activation buffer was prepared, and the
pH was changed with 1.0 M NaOH to the target 6.0. The amounts of NaCl and MES are
presented in table 4.

Buffer change was performed by centrifuging the beads three times in 10-minute cycles.
After each cycle, the supernatant was changed, and the pellet was resuspended. The

the reaction (5.0 mM). The reaction components were mixed well and left to react for
15 minutes at room temperature.

2. Capture antibody preparation and conjugation
The change of the storing solution was also made for the capture antibody stock solution.
The size of the IgG-antibody was expected to be 160 kDa and the storing buffer was
changed to 1X PBS solution. First, the antibody was diluted to PBS in a relation of 1:20 to
the total volume of 500 μl. Then the dilution was set to 100K centrifugal filtration unit
(fig.15 and 16), centrifuged 30 minutes, recovered, and resuspended again to 1X PBS in
a ratio of 1:25. The illustration of the centrifugal filter unit is presented in figures 15 (28)
and 16 (29) in more detail.

Figure 15. Centrifugal filtration - principle. The centrifugal filter unit was filled with 500 μl antibody solution and
centrifuged for 30 minutes. The recovery was then collected. The spin-column was turned upside down and centrifuged
again for 10 minutes. The recovered antibody was collected and resuspended to 1X PBS. (28)

collection, an inner tube for sample, and a membrane to filter particles larger than 0.22 μm. (29)

Antibody dilutions (1:25) were then diluted to PBS in a ratio of 1:5. These antibody
dilutions were added to bead solutions in a ratio of 1:10, 1:100, 1:1 000, and 1:10 000.
These dilutions are the relations towards antibody stock solution. Each antibody dilution
was added in a 50:50 ratio to beads and incubated for at least one hour at room
temperature. For each dilution, four replicates were prepared. This is how antibody was
covalently linked with carboxylated latex beads by active ester reaction.

3. Preparation and conjugation of labelled UCNPs
Upconversion nanoparticles used in this work were 74 nm by their size. These
nanoparticles were prepared from a stock solution in relation to 1:1000 in 1ml to Upcon®
Assay Buffer, which is the optimal assay buffer for UCNP particles. In order to maximize
the stability of the particulate solution, Upcon® Stabilizer concentrate was added to the
solution in a ratio of 1:50.
4. Antibody conjugation and sample preparation
After conjugation of secondary antibodies, the working buffer was changed to blocking
buffer (10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5, 0.1% Tween-20, and 1.0% BSA) to reduce overall
background and minimize non-specific signals. This separation method was
centrifugation. At this point, only one parameter concentration (i.e. number of beads,
UCNPs, or antibodies) was changed while others remained the same, allowing to modify
the varying parameter, if needed, and errors to be more easily traced.

The following volumes of reagents were added into sample wells. These amounts are
based on Wallac Oy’s DELFIA® Xpress PlGF instructions (30).
✓ 40 𝜇L of PlGF antigen (calibrators A-F)
✓ 30 𝜇L Antibody-bead solution
✓ 5 𝜇L UCNP- solution

After sampling, the plastic plate was placed in an incubator, equipped with a plate
shaker, and parameters were set at 30 min / 35 °C. After incubation, samples were
transferred to a 0.45 μm filter plate. The samples were first transferred to a plastic well
plate to prevent the premature filtration of the unbound phase before the binding
reaction.
5. Washing of excess label
After the transfer of the samples to the filter plate, the unbound label was removed by
using a vacuum pump. The plate was placed on a vacuum tray and the suction was turned
on (-10 kPa). (fig. 17) To maximize the suction power, a protective film was placed partly
on top of the plate. The vacuum was performed in 30-second cycles. Between these
cycles, 50 microliters of washing buffer (10 mM Tris buffer) was added into each well
with an in-line pipette. Washing cycles were tested and 10 times proved enough to
remove the excess unbound label. After the final wash, an extra 50 µl of washing buffer
was added to each well to ensure the moisture of the membrane and high signal
strength.

kPa.

6. Signal measurement
After vacuum filtration, the results were read with an Upcon® reader. Parameters used
in measurements are presented in table 17. Measurements were made to achieve the
optimal Ab-bead ratio, where the maximal signal occurs. The equivalence zone is
illustrated in figure 18. Excessive amounts of antibody, antigen, or even microbeads,
cause the signal decline; Excess amount of antibody will negatively affect the results, as
the antibodies may pack and clog the antigen-binding sites. Excess amount of antigen
causes falsely low signal because there are not enough antibodies to attach the antigenbinding sites. The illustration of this behaviour is presented in figure 18.

Figure 18. Optimization of antibody-antigen ratio. In the equivalence zone, the antigen-antibody ratio is ideal, and
the signal is reliable.

Four replicates were prepared and measured at different antibody-bead ratios. The
results for 20 μm beads are presented in table 6 and figure 19. The smaller the
concentration of beads is, the smaller deviation occurs within the replicates. In
measurements, the concentration of antibody remained the same in each sample. An
optimal antibody-bead ratio for 20 μm beads was achieved with 1:100 dilutions. The
signal stops increasing at some point, although the amount of antibody relative to the
number of beads is higher. This indicates that there are no free COOH-binding sites on
the surface of the beads.

Table 6. Results for each dilution. 20 µm beads, 30% laser power. Single point measurement. The signal was, as
expected, significantly lower in dilutions 1:10 000 and 1:100 000. However, the signal level no longer increased after a
1:1 000 dilution, although there were significantly more beads at a 1: 100 dilution. The full results are presented in
table 21.

The analyte-specific concentration was also studied. Measurements were made for 12
and 15 μm beads. Beads were diluted in activation buffer at a ratio of 1:100. These series
of dilutions were performed to ensure that the capture antibody was successfully
conjugated to the beads, and the conjugation of the UCNP-coated antibodies to the
analyte was successful. The results are presented in table 7 and figure 20.

The filter plate was not very reproducible in terms of results, although it was possible to
verify the functionality of the method. Problems with the filter plate included adhesion of
the sample to the membrane during filtration. This means that the antibody-analyte-label
complexes were not evenly distributed at the bottom of the plate. This, in turn, gives a higher
signal to some parts of the filter plate and a much lower signal to some other points.

This inaccuracy was demonstrated with the raster measurement. The raster measurement
allows visiting and inspecting several locations on the filter plate (fig. 21.)

Figure 21. An illustration of a raster measurement results. The main idea of raster measurement is to measure the signal
in several sections of the well. This enables to test of the uniformity of the sample.

The results of raster measurements for parallel 12 and 15 µm bead samples (calibrator F) are
presented in figure 22 and table 8. Full results and CV percentages are presented in tables
22, 23, 24, and 25. The coefficient of variation is used to compare the variances and is
defined as the quotient of the standard deviation and the mean. One 12 µm sample gave an
exceptionally large signal and was, therefore, removed from the graph and not included in
the calculations.

5.2 Filtration protocol
Beads used to develop and verify the cross-flow filtration method were 12 and 15 µm sized.
Prior to filtration, the antibody conjugation protocol described in the previous section was
followed, but the samples were not transferred from the plastic well plate to the filter plate.
The sample was placed into a 60 ml plastic bottle and washing buffer was placed in another
similar bottle. In cross-flow filtration, the flow is applied tangentially across the membrane
surface. The flow moves across the membrane surface and the filtrate passes through while
concentrate accumulates at the opposite end of the membrane. In addition to the parts
mentioned in the previous section, the following components are presented in table 9.

The cross-flow filter chip used in this work (fig. 23) works as follows: (a) An Upcon Assay buffer
used as a washing solution was fed to the filter chip. (b) The excess label with a washing buffer
formed a waste solution. (c) The sample was fed to the filter plate. (d) The sample, from which
the excess unbound label had been filtered, was removed from the filter chip. (e) All additional
sample entries were blocked.

to the filtration chip and mini luer plugs to clog unnecessary holes on the chip. (a) The washing solution is fed, (b) waste

Silicone was selected as the tubing material to carry the sample and washing solution. There
were two sized silicone tubes used in the filtration. Dimensions of silicone tubes were ID:2.5
mm/OD: 4mm, and ID 0.76 mm/OD:1.65 mm. Filtering was performed by feeding air through
compressed air hoses to airtight bottles with a 5 ml syringe. Before sample addition, the filter
chip was vented with a washing buffer. This was accomplished by blocking the air inlet for the
sample bottle. The syringe was then supplied with 2 ml of air, i.e., three full syringes. The
sample flowed smoothly through the tubing and all sample was presumably collected into the
sample container.
The compressed air flow through compressed air tubing transferred small amounts of fluid
from bottles via silicone tubing to the filter chip (fig. 24). All tubes were held in the correct
array while dispensing into the filter plate. As mentioned before, other bottle contained the
sample, other the washing solution. At this stage, it was also important to divide the supply
air into two feeds, as the sample and washing buffer must pass through the filter chip at the
same flow rate.

Figure 24. Cross flow filtration system was built to test the carryover and indicate the functionality of the filtration method.
(a) Air is fed to the system via syringe. (b) The air supply is distributed so that the same flow rate enters both hoses. (c) Sample
and washing buffer are pulled to silicone tubing after pressurization. (d) Silicone tubing leads both fluids to the cross-flow
filtration chip. (e) Sample and waste solution are separated into Erlenmeyer flasks. (f) Samples are collected to smaller
Erlenmeyer flasks for measurements.

Residual of the carryover was also investigated. Carryover means a clinging of a sample to a
tubing or a filtration chip. This remaining sample contaminates the reaction mixture of the
next test immediately following the initial assay.
The following protocol was carried out to study the carryover: First, 2 ml of air was pulled into
the tubing to filter the sample. The signal of the sample was measured resulting a clear signal.
The sample was then changed to washing buffer so that both tubes fed the washing solution
to the filter chip. 2 ml of air was pulled into the tubing and the solution in the clean sample
container was measured. This step was repeated until the carryover no longer occurred. The
results are presented in table 10.

Table 10. Carryover was studied and 6 ml of washing buffer through both tubing resulted no carryover from the initial sample.
Also, efficiency of filter chip was tested. The results on the right side indicate that the filtration is more accurate if washing is
continued after the sample has passed the filtration chip. This leads bigger sample volumes but ensures that all sample has
removed from the chip. The sample was divided into 1 or 3 wells and the waste solution was divided into 3 wells.

The measurement was performed again with 12 μm beads, but with a larger sample volume.
The total sample volume before filtration was 7 200 μl (450 μl Ab + beads + UCNP + 6 750 μl
washing buffer) so the dilution ratio was 1:16. The signal strength after the first filtration
was 7 237 counts. The carryover re-test results are presented below in figure 25.

1. Required parameters
The purpose of the device was to utilize compressed air to transport liquids, from both the
sample container and the washing buffer container, at the same flow rate to the filter plate.
The immunoassay developed during the work generated a fluidic flow to the filtration area,
where the sample was collected. The device consisted of several smaller units and processes,
each developed separately: compressed air supply, valve controlling, programming, the
addition of sample and washing solution, incubation area, and the filtration area.

43
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

The following flow chart (fig. 26) was also prepared to facilitate the design of the device and
illustrates the progress of the sample flow in green and the washing solution flow in blue.

Figure 26. The following diagram is divided into two parts ((a) and (b)) and gives a functional overview of the device. It shows
the connection of pipes and other transport routes to the filtration chip. (a) In the first part, compressed air is fed to the
pressure controller and airflow regulator. The airflow is fed to the sample and washing solution container. The airflow with
customized pressure and flow rate pushes the liquid sample from the sample solution container to the incubation area. (b)
The Arduino-controlled pump controls the sample low back and forth. After incubation, the sample is pushed with pressurized
air to the filtration chip where the waste solution and measurable sample are separated. (Modified from the source 31)

The device required clean compressed air to operate. The pressure controller controlled the
compressed air with an air flow regulator. These two were connected in series and a manual
valve 1 was placed after an airflow regulator. The airflow from the flow regulator was divided
into two different hoses connected to manual valves 2 and 3. In these manual valves, the
44
Åbo Akademi University | Suvi Marjatta Karppinen

closure element was attached to a stem that maintains an interface with the handwheel. The
compressed air led the airflow to the sample container (40 μl analyte, 30 μl Ab/bead solution,
5 μl UCNP solution) and washing solution container (UCNP washing solution). The air pressure
was adjusted to the capacity limits of the valves and to keep the solution uniform in hoses.
The aim was to keep the air pressure low (0.45 bar after pressure controller, 0.016-0.019 bar
after airflow regulator). If the pressure had been too high, the sample would have
disintegrated in tubing and not fed evenly on the filter chip.
The washing solution was pushed directly to the filtration chip and the sample into the
incubation area. The incubation area consisted of silicone tubing, a hollow plastic tubing, a
resistance wire, and a power supply. The resistance wire was twisted around the silicone tube
and covered with a hard-plastic tube. The parameter 0.68 V and 0.47 A were set to achieve
37.6 °C temperature inside the plastic tube. Valve 4 was placed after the incubation area to
prevent the sample from getting into the filtration chip before incubation.
A peristaltic pump (motor, 5 V, 0.3 A) was placed before the incubation area. The pump
controlled the back-and-forth movement of the sample (0.5 s forward, 0.5 s backward) with
the Arduino Uno electronic platform (5 V). A relay bridge was connected to the platform to
operate the pump in both directions. The following connections (fig. 27) controlled the
operation of the pump:
o
o

o

The relay was connected to the pump with electrical wires; COM1 to positive terminal and COM2 to
negative terminal.
The relay was connected to the power supply with electrical wires; NO1 (normal open, the voltage circuit
is open) and NO2 to positive terminals, NC1 (normal closed, the voltage circuit is closed) and NC2 to
negative terminals.
The Arduino Uno was connected to a relay from four different outputs; GND (ground) to GND, VDD to 5
V, EN1 to pin 13, EN2 to pin 12. The relay was also connected to the computer via a USB port. The
connection of GND to the relay guaranteed the continuous grounding for the complex.

Figure 27. The connections and nominal voltages of the motor, relay, and Arduino are shown in the diagram. The Arduino was
connected to a relay via four different outputs: pin 12, pin 13, 5 V, and GND. Arduino was also connected to the peristaltic
pump via COM1 and COM2 ports.

The activation of the circulation was performed with a Python 3.9 (64-bit) software.
Information given by the program gave a chance to modify the flow parameters if necessary.
The program worked as follows: Number 1 was pressed on the computer keyboard to activate
the pump circulation. It was also possible to set the start time of the run on the display. The
number 0 was pressed when the pump circulation was interrupted. At this stage, it was also
possible to set the end time of the run on the display. figure 28 below is taken from the
computer screen after one successful run.

The device was tested to optimize the sample flow control. Testing was done by comparing
all bead sizes. During these measurements, only 15 and 12 μm bead samples were retained
as a complete sample column. The sample decomposition might have resulted in the signal
strength of 10 and 20 μm bead samples. The results are presented in figure 30 and table 12.
The full results are presented in table 26.

Figure 30. Bead sizes were tested at the same bead concentration (1: 100). Based on these results, the tested calibration
curve was created for 12 µm bead dilutions.

The device was also tested by creating a dilutions series of calibrators A, D, and F. Two series
were made with 15 μm bead size. During these measurements, all samples were retained as
a complete sample column. The results are presented in figure 31 and table 13. The full
results are presented in table 27. The parallel dilutions results performed with rastermeasurement results are presented in table 28.

Figure 31. The PlGF analyte concentrations A, D, and F were measured with 15 μm beads. The following calibrator curve
indicates that the strength of the signal increases when the amount of the analyte is increased. Also, the signal strength of
the waste solution decreases when there is more binding area with larger amount of analyte.

The measurements for all calibrators (A-F) were carried out with a 12 µm bead size. Calibrators
A-E gave the signal as predicted, but the calibrator F gave unfavorable results. Re-tests for F
were made three times with no success. This unexpected phenomenon may be due to the
“Hooks effect” when the concentration of analyte increases above a saturation point and the
signal begins to decline. It is also possible that no conjugation has occurred due to the shape
of the sample column during the run. The results are presented in figure 32 and table 14. The
full results are presented in table 29.

5. Conclusions
The purpose of this master´s thesis was to develop a fluidic analysis method based on modern
immunoassays. In this work, the selected antigen was placental growth factor (PlGF). The
developed assay utilized antibody-conjugated beads for PlGF analyte as a carrier material
instead of conventional plastic well plates. The COOH-coated polystyrene beads used in this
work ranged from 10 to 20 μm in size. A specific anti-PlGF antibody was conjugated to the
beads and the optimal concentration and saturation point to the binding surface area of the
COOH groups were examined. In turn, the target analyte from the sample was detected using
analyte-specific upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that bind to the appropriate epitope of
the immobilized target antigen. In the filtration protocol, a problem proved to be that the
particle compounds stuck to the bottom of the membrane of the filter plate. Because of this,
the results of the counts varied, and raster measurements were carried out. 12 μm sized beads
proved the most stable behaviour and the protocol was proved to be functional, as the results
indicated that the method can detect PlGF.
A semi-automated fluidic immunoassay was developed and evaluated in this work. Samples
with different bead sizes were tested to examine the influence and behaviour of the variables
as well as the performance of the device. Overall, the semi-automated fluidic device can
detect even very small amounts of PlGF antigen in a sample. Challenges occurred mainly due
to the difficulty in adjusting the flow rate manually. The sample had to run smoothly through
the piping – if the sample decomposed, e.g. during the incubation, binding did not occur.
Possible reasons for the variable signals with parallel samples could have been the adhesion
of the beads to the piping, as well as the incompatibility of the piping materials with the
sample. Substances that alter any kind of measurable concentration of the analyte or disrupt
antibody binding reactions can potentially cause interference. To avoid possible crossreactions during sample handling, the protective laboratory equipment was always used when
samples were handled. The actual immunoassay was not located in the laminar flow cabinet,
so there was a possibility for cross-contamination from surroundings.
The future for fluidic bead-based immunoassay looks promising but will need much more
testing and optimization. Optimizing the materials of the device, as well as automating the
valves and pneumatics, would facilitate the user's operation. A pneumatic system, which
utilizes compressed air to transmit the sample, might produce air bubbles in the system. Air
vents, for example, could be an option to eliminate these bubbles. It would also be possible
to automate sample loading. This could be carried out by using separate containers from
which the beads, analytes, and antibodies would be fed directly into the pipeline in a
controlled way.

In order to fully verify the operation of the filter chip connected to the microfluidic platform,
it would be an option to add a colorant into the sample. This is how the flow of the sample in
a chip could be visually verified. The size of the sample solution container could also be
optimized for even smaller sample volumes in the future. In the current method, the sample
volume was relatively small compared to the size of the sample solution container. The sample
container had to be manually tipped during the measurement.
There will possibly be a complete fluidic bead-based immunoassay with automated computeraided systems, where machine learning, and materials and methods are further explored.
