As the problems caused by conventional plastic polymers derived from fossil raw
materials are increasing, the need for replacements is growing with an accelerated rate.
That is why this thesis aimed to produce plastic-like biomaterial from a renewable, biobased, and non-toxic resource that could be coated on paper or cross-linked as freestanding pieces. The raw material used was xylan-rich hemicelluloses from Finnish birch.
The material was fractionated using a novel BLN-method and it retained a high molar
mass and degree of polymerization throughout the isolation process. The hemicellulose
was modified in aqueous phase with methacrylic anhydride at pH 8, to introduce
functional groups in the xylan chain. The properties of the material were changed towards
plastic-like through chemical modification.
No acceptable films could be made from the unmodified xylan; the films shattered
during drying and even externally plasticized films were extremely brittle and readily
water-soluble. The preparation time was also very long. In order to increase the plasticity
of the xylan material, modifications were carried out while varying the ratio of xylan
material and added methacrylic anhydride reagent as well as the concentration of xylans
in water during the experiment. The degree of substitution varied between 0.14 and 0.63
when 2 is the theoretical maximum.
The modified material was mixed with plasticizers, a cross-linker, and a
photoinitiator to achieve a material, which was able to be cross-linked with the help of a
UV light source. The UV active suspension was radiated on a Teflon-coated surface when
free-standing bioplastic pieces were obtained. The suspension was also coated on filter
paper and cross-linked onto the cellulose substrate. The material hardened already after
30 seconds under the UV light, but in most cases, the material was radiated for 3 minutes
to ensure proper cross-linking.

Abstract

The cross-linked xylan coating decreased the air permeability and increased the
hydrophobicity of the paper. The mechanical properties changed so that tensile strength
decreased slightly, and elongation was somewhat increased. The air permeability
decreased severely, the coated paper had only 0.3% of the pure base substrate’s
permeability. The hydrophobicity of the paper also increased drastically. As a freestanding bioplastic, the cross-linked material was not water-soluble.
The materials made from modified xylans had promising properties and qualities,
but they are not yet perfect. The yield of the modification was below 50% and the
modified material required the use of external plasticizers to have the properties of a
plastic material. Nevertheless, xylans are interesting material for future research. The
modification could be done in an organic solvent and thereby increasing the DS.
Alternatively, the concentration of xylans in water after the reaction could be increased,
which might increase the yield. The material has industrial-scale potential if the problems
listed above can be solved. Overall, this renewable and easily accessible raw material
presented an attractive opportunity to be modified into a material that can partly enable
the current need to replace conventional fossil-based plastics with more environmentally
benign alternatives.

1 Introduction
In recent years, plastic material has caused problems for the environment due to its fossil
origins and poor degradability in nature. Several attempts have been made to find a
replacement for the plastic polymers as we know it, but due to its great properties and
cheap manufacturing, it is not an easy task. Luckily, people have become more conscious
of the threats of plastic and are prepared to make sustainable decisions.
Many polymers can be found in nature that could possibly solve the problems that
fossil-based plastics have caused. The interest in using renewable materials from forests
and agriculture, to produce materials replacing fossil-based plastics, is growing. For
example, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin have been under investigation to see
whether they could become new replacement materials. Also, composite materials
including these biomass components have been vigorously researched.
The main problems that have occurred during the research of replacing plastic
with natural materials are the lack of fundamental understanding, variation in the raw
material composition, the nutritious value of the raw material, analytical problems, and
the breakdown problem. Time and resources are needed for the research and product
development of new materials. While fossil-based plastic materials have had a long,
almost 200 years of product development, the replacing materials are taking their first
baby steps. It does not make the task easier that every individual tree and straw varies in
chemical composition, size, dryness, etc., not to mention the differences in accessibility
during different seasons. To ensure a continuous supply of raw material throughout the
year, it would probably be beneficial to use several sources to produce sustainable plastic
materials. This way the production is not as easily impacted by the seasonal availability
of raw materials.
The third problem is more an ethical one. For example starch has nutritional value,
it would need to be decided whether to use starch to manufacture food or bio-based
plastic. Besides, the problem of separation and analytics needs to be considered when the
raw materials are from nature. Such materials are often composite materials, which makes
them so functional. Problems occur when the different components are being isolated
because some residues of the other components always remain. Moreover, the treatments
are often so harsh that the raw material is either broken down or modified during the
separation process. The so-called “breakdown problem” requires optimization. It is not
easy to decide, to what extent it is feasible to break down a polymeric raw material just
to build it up again from monomers in order to attain certain properties to the final product.
Even though the task is difficult for all the reasons mentioned above, it was
decided to take part in this battle against fossil-based plastic. In this master’s thesis work,
a bio-based raw material and its capability to form a plastic-like substance were explored.
Also, a few ways to chemically modify the material to increase the plasticity were
investigated. The raw material, hemicellulose, was extracted from lignocellulosic

biomass, in this case, trees. Hemicelluloses are, right after cellulose, the second most
abundant plant-based carbohydrate material available on a global scale. Many kinds of
hemicelluloses exist but the focus in this work was on xylan, which is the main type of
hemicellulose in hardwood trees.

2.1 Feedstocks of hemicelluloses
2.1.1 Wood structure
Wood, a lignocellulosic composite material, consists of several different kinds of building
blocks that can be used to design new materials or chemicals, etc. The structural
components in wood are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The chemical composition
of these elements is dependent on the type or species of wood. Also, all individuals are
different, and the chemical composition varies based on the growing surroundings and
the environment.
Different parts of a tree such as bark or heartwood, which are shown in Figure 1A,
as well as specific parts in each wood cell, shown in Figures 1B and 1C, have different
chemical compositions. In Table 1, the number of different structural elements in the
specific parts of the wood cells are listed. It shows that almost all the polysaccharides can
be found in the cell’s secondary wall and the lignin and extractives have the highest
concentration in the middle lamella and primary wall. (Fardim, 2011)

Cellulose
Cellulose is the main structural element in wood and wood-like plants where it
accounts for the mechanical support for the tree. Chemically, it consists of repeating β-ᴅglucopyranose units that are linked with (1→4)-glucosidic bonds so that every other unit
is upside down. Due to its molecular structure, shown in Figure 2, cellulose creates a
linear polymer with inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen-bonding
network is the main reason for the high crystallinity of cellulose. This network also results
in the high strength and poor solubility of cellulose into water and other common solvents.
(Sjöström, 1981)

Figure 2 Schematic representation of the molecular structure of cellulose
Cellulose has a nanofibrillar structure, which means the polymer chains selfassemble into highly packed small fibrils with high crystallinity in nanoscale. Between
the tightly packed crystalline areas are amorphous areas of less well-organized polymer
chains. If cellulose is treated with a strong acid, i.e. hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), an intensive and selective degrading of the amorphous areas takes place,
which leads to the formation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). This material has the
properties of a nanomaterial, which are very different from the properties of original
cellulose raw material. (Alén, 2011)

Hemicelluloses
Hemicelluloses are heteropolysaccharides and unlike cellulose, they often consist
of different repeating sugar units. The types of sugar units i.e. the type of hemicellulose
depend on the tree species. Hemicelluloses create mechanical strength for wood together
with cellulose, but it is a considerably smaller polymer and has very different properties.
In most cases, the amount of hemicelluloses is about 20-30% of the dry weight of wood
(Sjöström, 1981). Hemicelluloses are more water-soluble and do not form crystalline
parts like cellulose does.
As mentioned, a hemicellulose can consist of several types of different sugar units.
The units can be hexoses or pentoses, which is defined by the number of carbon atoms in
the sugar ring. The most common hexoses are ᴅ-glucose, ᴅ-mannose and ᴅ-galactose,
whereas e.g. ᴅ-xylose and ᴅ-arabinose are common pentoses. In addition, acid forms of
hexoses, which are called hexuronic acids, can be attached as side groups to the
hemicellulose chains. The hexuronic acids are carbohydrate monomers with a carboxylic
acid group as one of the substituents. The hemicellulose chains can have also other
substituents attached to the free carbons in the sugar units’ ring carbons. One example of
a substituent is an acetyl group that can affect, for example, the hemicellulose’s watersolubility.
It is good to keep in mind that in wood exists small amounts of other
polysaccharides as well, which are not counted as cellulose or hemicelluloses. Starch and
pectins form a special group as an addition to the polysaccharides that can be found from
wood (Fardim, 2011).

Lignin
Lignin is the third main structural element of wood, and its task is to act as a glue
or matrix of the composite and hold the other building blocks together. It has a very
different structure compared to cellulose and hemicelluloses. Lignin consists of the
phenylpropane units: guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units, also
called coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol respectively, all shown
in Figure 3A (Lapierre et al., 1995; Duval & Lawoko, 2014). The structure of lignin has
long been under investigation, but it still is somewhat unclear. Several researchers have
made suggestions of the structure, one of which is presented in Figure 3B (Zakzeski et
al., 2010).

et al., 2010)
Extractives
In addition to the three main structural components, even many other compounds
are found in wood. The common name of these is extractives. They form a very
heterogenic and large group consisting of non-structural, low molar mass substances. This
group includes both lipophilic and hydrophilic substances and one good example of a
lipophilic compound is resin. The purpose of extractives in wood is to protect the tree

Sara Kesäläinen

Theory

from microbiological damage and function as an energy source. The extractives can, in
addition, give rise to colored substances in the tree or the fragrance from freshly cut wood.
As well as the structural elements, the amount and sort of extractives vary with
the wood species and even between the different parts of the tree. A few of the main types
of extractives that can be found in wood are terpenes and terpenoids, esters of fatty acids,
fatty acids and alcohols, and alkanes (Fardim, 2011). Some of these extractives have been
investigated and several commercialized products are derived from these, such as tall oil
soap and sitostanol (derived from sitosterol, shown in Figure 4), which is used for
lowering cholesterol levels in the blood.

Image: Sara Kesäläinen, adapted from (Fardim, 2011)
2.1.2 Hardwood
In hardwood, dominating lignin units are guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units, and the main
type of hemicellulose is xylan, and more specifically O-acetyl-4-O-methylglucurono-βᴅ-xylan. On the molecular level, the backbone consists of xylose units, linked by (1→4)bonds and substituted acetyl groups that are often at the C2 or C3 position of some of the
xylose monomers, also shown in Figure 5 (Sjöström, 1981). One of the substituents in
xylan is a hexeuronic acid, which in Figure 5 is a metylglucurono acid. Hardwoods also
contain small amounts of hemicelluloses consisting of mannan polymers, which is the
main type in softwood (Popa, 1996).

groups and (1→2) 4-O-methyl-α-ᴅ-glucuronic acid residues

2.1.3 Softwood
Like hardwood, the main types of lignin units in softwood are the guaiacyl and syringyl
units. The main type of hemicellulose in softwood trees are galactoglucomannans (GGM),
which have a backbone of two sugar monomers, β-ᴅ-glucopyranose, and β-ᴅmannopyranose units, linked with (1→4) bonds. The galactose units are as branched from
the backbone and the ratio of the galactose:glucose:mannose units can vary between
0.1:1:4 and 1:1:3 (Sjöström, 1981). The galactoglucomannan polymeric chains are often
also partly acetylated. Also, unlike hardwood, softwood has a larger range of different
species hemicellulose, and a significant quantity of xylan exists (Popa, 1996).

2.1.4 Non-wood
Today, wood is the main source of fibers for papermaking, hemicellulose, and lignin, but
other possibilities exist as well. These non-wood sources differ considerably concerning
the chemical composition, micro- and macroscopic structure, as well as the physical
properties of the fibers. Many commercially important fiber sources, such as cotton, flax,
hemp, jute, and bamboo are available. During the past decades, as people have become
more aware of global warming, replacing especially cotton and bamboo has started to
gain interest. Particularly fibers from agricultural waste are at the center of attention as
replacement materials. Biomass sources such as wheat and rice straw, sugarcane bagasse,
or corn stalk have become a popular area of research. (Fardim, 2011)
In non-wood, different plants contain different types of hemicelluloses. Most of
the agricultural residues such as corn stalks, flax straw, and kenaf stalks have a higher
content of xylose and arabinose than mannose and galactose. On the other hand, all the
above-mentioned non-woods have larger amounts of glucose monomers than the other
hemicellulose units (Popa, 1996). Also, bamboo seems to follow the pattern and has high
amounts of xylans, yet a larger percentage of glucose monomers (Sharma et al., 2018).
Unlike the lignin in wood material, the non-wood lignin consists mostly of
p-hydroxyphenyl units (Fardim, 2011; Sharma et al., 2018). The other significant
difference between wood and non-wood is the higher ash and silica content in the nonwood, especially in some agricultural waste species. The amounts of different elements
vary depending on e.g. the climate and soil, but for example, rice straw can have up to
20% ash of the whole weight (Sridach, 2010). The high silica and ash content can cause
problems during fractionation processing.

2.2 Fractionation of wood components
Fractionation is the process where biomass is separated into its structural components.
The different fractions can often be collected from different stages of the process by
different means. In some processes, some fractions may be partly or completely lost due
to harsh treatment conditions or degraded by the chemicals used. The three first
fractionation methods that are listed here are pulping-based biorefining and often mostly
focused on preserving and keeping the fibers i.e. the cellulose-fraction intact.

2.2.1 Kraft method
The kraft method produces strong fibers that are suitable for most paper grades. Cellulose
fractionated with the kraft method has a lower crystallinity than the cellulose prepared at
acidic conditions, which makes the fibrous material slightly more elastic and less rigid
(Fernandez & Young, 1996). The kraft method has somewhat low selectivity and that
causes the polysaccharides to react with the cooking liquor, but mostly it affects
hemicelluloses by causing deacetylation, peeling, and alkaline hydrolysis (Alén, 2011).
The kraft lignin that can be collected from the process contains sulfur, which gives an
unpleasant odor to the fraction.
The cooking liquor used in the kraft method, the so-called while liquor, consists
of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S). The pH in this method is
alkaline and after cooking, as the alkali-soluble lignin fragments, degraded
hemicelluloses, and other organic materials have dissolved in the cooking liquid, it is
washed from the pulp and called black liquor. The black liquor is concentrated and burned
in a recovery furnace for energy and production of the inorganic salts, which are dissolved
in water for green liquor and causticized for recovery of the original cooking liquor.
(Tran & Vakkilainen, 2008)
Salts are the most harmful components for the kraft pulping and that is why nonwood material, except for bamboo, cannot be used for kraft pulping. When it comes to
different wood species, the kraft process does not have so strict qualifications because the
extractives in wood do not disturb the cooking process. (Alén, 2011)

2.2.2 Sulfite method
The kraft method has become the most common pulping method in the world but the
sulfite method is still an important method for producing certain pulp grades. The pulp
produced using the sulfite method has fewer odor problems and has higher brightness of
even unbleached pulps. The sulfite cooking method has more strict requirements in terms
of raw material when compared to the kraft method. For example, polymerization of some

Sara Kesäläinen

extractives can cause problems during the pulp production and that is why some wood
species are not acceptable in the sulfite process. (Alén, 2011)
The sulfite method is more flexible than kraft because it covers the pH range from
acidic to alkaline, however, the rate of delignification depends strongly on the pH. It is
possible to prepare, for example dissolving pulp, which can be spun into textile fibers,
with the acid sulfite method. The cooking liquor consists of different active species
containing sulfur. The proportions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulfite ions (HSO3-),
and sulfite ions (SO32-) depend on the pH that is used in the cooking. Due to the toxic
effects of sulfur on the environment, all used chemicals are recovered and reused in the
process. (Alén, 2011)
During sulfite pulping, especially in the acid conditions, the polysaccharides,
mostly hemicellulose, is degraded to a high degree due to acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic
linkages between the sugar monomers. Also, deacetylation takes place during cooking.
The monosaccharide fragments can be found dissolved in the cooking liquor. Under acid
conditions, the lignin is sulfonated and hydrolyzed, which makes the acid-soluble lignin
fractions dissolve in the cooking liquor. (Alén, 2011)

2.2.3 Organosolv methods
The two widely used and old pulping methods described above are important for
producing paper and fiber material. However, they use harmful chemicals such as sulfur
and the reaction conditions are often so rough that some fractions are destroyed. That is
why with time new process methods have been needed to match the biorefinery-thinking
where all the valuable by-products need to be collected and refined to produce new
products, all in an environmentally healthy way. (Alén, 2011)
The name organosolv initiates from the fact that these methods utilize only or
partly organic solvents as the cooking liquids. These have included alcohols, such as
methanol, ethanol, butanol, and glycol or carboxylic acids, e.g. formic or acetic acid.
More complicated processes such as Organocell have been created during the years, but
commercial organosolv processes are still somewhat rare. On the other hand, the
organosolv methods are more flexible in terms of raw material and non-wood can also be
used in the process. Depending on the method, chemicals, and raw material used, the
properties of the material fractions vary. The process conditions are often milder and that
is why also the lignin, extractives, and hemicellulose fraction can be collected and utilized
to a greater extent. (Alén, 2011)

2.2.4 BLN-process
The company CH-Bioforce Oy has developed a method to retrieve the biomass fractions
from wood or other materials in a way that all the material fractions stay almost unaltered,
for example, the hemicelluloses recovered has a high molar mass and high purity. The
raw material is treated with pressurized hot water in the absence of oxygen (von Schoultz,
2014). The hemicelluloses are received from the process in an aqueous solution, which
can be cooled down and stored for future use. The rest of the material continues to cooking
with special parameters, after which lignin and cellulose can be separately collected as
shown in Figure 6 (Sjögren, 2018). All the collected materials can then be directly used
or modified to adapt several end-use applications.

2.3 Functionalization of wood polysaccharides
Some functionalization processes done on wood polysaccharides are fairly old. An
example of a functionalization product is the carboxymethylated cellulose (CMC), which
is a conversion process of alkali swollen cellulose in aqueous NaOH solution with an
excess of organic liquid such as ethanol or isopropanol, with the reactive agent
monochloroacetic acid or its sodium salt. This modification has been commercial since
the 1920s (Heinze & Pfeiffer, 1999). The CMC is the most widely used chemically
modified cellulose derivative and it can be found from numerous industrial applications,
often as thickener, emulsifier, adhesive, and sizing agent in paints, coatings, cosmetics,
foods, and textiles (Hollabaugh et al., 1945; Coffey et al., 2006).

2.3.1 Applications for hemicelluloses
In literature, several research studies have been done with hemicelluloses and
modification of their properties. A large number of publications covers the research of
galactoglucomannans (GGM) (Xu, C. et al., 2010; Mikkonen et al., 2013; Kisonen et al.,
2015; Xu, W. et al., 2018) but xylan-based or xylan-rich hemicelluloses have also been
investigated (Gabrielii et al., 2000; Kayserilioğlu et al., 2003; Gröndahl et al., 2004; Peng
et al., 2012; Mikkonen & Tenkanen, 2012; Fundador et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Sun
et al., 2016). For example, Mikkonen & Tenkanen (2012) have made edible films of
xylans, but as they conclude, the lack of large-scale production has been hindering the
progress. They also state that research should be concentrated on the modification of
xylan to decrease the moisture sensitivity and water solubility of the xylan products
(Mikkonen & Tenkanen, 2012). It has also been stated in the literature that plasticized
xylan films have low oxygen permeability and the potential to be used, for instance, in
the food industry (Gröndahl et al., 2004).
Already in 1996, it was known that hemicelluloses can be converted into several
different products, such as chemicals, sweeteners, materials, and drugs as shown in Figure
7 (Popa, 1996; Deutschmann & Dekker, 2012). Hemicelluloses are used also in
commercial products as emulsifiers, stabilizers, and binders in the food industry. Pectins
are widely known to be used as a gelling agent in jams and jellies and as a stabilizer in
low pH drinks such as fermented drinks (Spiridon & Popa, 2008). Hemicelluloses have
found to be important for the pulp strength in the pulping industry by making the fibers
less stiff and brittle (Molin & Teder, 2002).

2.4 Plasticity
The concept plasticity stands for a material that can undergo an irreversible deformation
due to the stress applied to it, without cracking or shattering. In principle, thermoplastics
and thermosets are the two kinds of plastics that exist. Thermoplastics soften as they are
heated and that way they can be formed. Thermoplastic materials are always processed
above their glass transition temperature, Tg. When they are cooled down, they preserve
their shape, but they can be heated up again, and be given a new form. Thermosets, in
contrast, harden as they are heated (cured), and they form cross-links with irreversible
bonds, which make the shape permanent. They cannot be re-heated or cooled and shaped
again. (University of Southern Mississippi, 2005a)
When talking about polymers, plasticity is the ability of the polymer chains to
move past each other without being tangled or caught up in each other (University of
Southern Mississippi, 2005b). The mobility of the polymer chains is dependent on the
degree of cross-linking, whether the chains are straight or branched, and how tightly
packed the chains are. These properties can be modified, for example, by derivatizing the
polymer or adding plasticizers.

2.4.1 Glass transition temperature
Every amorphous polymer has a glass transition temperature (Tg). This temperature is
defined as a midpoint of a temperature range where the change of the material properties
takes place. The amorphous polymer becomes softer, more pliable, and even rubbery
above the Tg and hard and brittle below the Tg. The glass transition is a second-order
transition, which means that the heat capacity changes but no latent heat is detected. This
can be noted when compared to melting (see example in Figure 8). When a particle is
melting, heat is required but the temperature does not rise, which means that latent heat
of melting is required. (University of Southern Mississippi, 2005)
The accurate measurement of the glass transition temperature range is not
very easy. The most common methods to determine the Tg of a polymer are either with a
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), or
through thermomechanical analysis (TMA). With a DSC the changed heat capacity of the
material is measured, TMA measures the coefficient of thermal expansion and DMA
tracks the stiffness of the polymer while heated. (Sime, 2013)
The glass transition temperature is dependent on how easily the polymer chains
can move around each other. If they can easily slide past each other without cross-linking
or being caught up in each other, the glass transition temperature is low. The Tg can be
modified by adding plasticizers or modifying the polymer by derivatizing its functional
parts. The fewer side chains, reactive parts, and the more space (or free volume) between
the chains the polymer has, the lower is its Tg. (University of Southern Mississippi, 2005)

(down) for melting (left) and glass transition temperature (right).

2.4.2 Plasticizers
Plasticizers are often small molecules, which can react with the polymer or be found
between the polymer chains. Their task is to space out the polymer chains from each other.
That is called increasing the free volume. By interfering with the polymer’s internal bonds
and increasing the free volume, the polymer chains can move around more freely, which
makes it a more plastic material. Often small molecules are used, especially when the
plasticization is done externally. On the other hand, big and bulky molecules can also be
used as plasticizers. For example, by increasing the number of carbons in the pendant
alkyl chain of methacrylate polymers in Figure 9, a lower Tg can be achieved. This is
internal plasticization as the molecule itself acts as a plasticizer to itself. (University of
Southern Mississippi, 2005)

2.5 Cross-linking with UV irradiation
2.5.1 Cross-linking
Cross-linking is a term that describes the event when individual molecules or molecule
chains link up and irregularly attach to each other. This can also be called curing when
talking about plastics. Materials can be cross-linked with different methods, which are,
for example, heat, irradiation, or special chemicals. As an example, peroxides are often
used to create free radicals, which then can be cross-linked in elevated or ambient heat.
The cross-linking can be controlled, initiated, accelerated, or inhibited with special
additives. (Murphy, 2001)
In the modern world, such cross-linking methods that are rapid and safe to use are
more preferred. The use of methods with high energy consumption or environmentally
unfriendly or possibly toxic chemical consumption is being cut back or replaced. That is
one of the reasons why in this work a controlled radical cross-linking reaction initiated
by UV radiation was used.

2.5.2 UV light
Ultraviolet light is electromagnetic radiation just as visible light, but it is not
visible for the human eye. The wavelength of ultraviolet light is shorter than the
wavelengths for visible light. The sun is the most important source of ultraviolet light on
Earth. The sun produces three different forms of UV radiation, UVA, UVB, and UVC.
The UVC is the most harmful type of ultraviolet radiation, but it is almost completely
absorbed already in the atmosphere. The UVB is the part of the ultraviolet spectrum that
causes sunburns and cell mutations or damage. UVA has the closest wavelength to the
blue light, visible for humans and it is not as harmful as UVB and UVC with shorter
wavelengths. (NASA Science, 2016)
UV light is a popular method to cross-link materials including living cells and
proteins. Ultraviolet light is also used by dentists since the late 1960s. Dentists use the
radiation to cross-link dental filling materials when they do restorations. The UV light
cross-linking method has many good qualities, but one of its limitations is the low
depth-of-cure and that is why it is not suitable for cross-linking, for example, deep holes
in teeth (Stansbury, 2000). Although, due to the UV curing method’s high speed,
effectiveness, controllability, and low cost, also other industrial and research areas have
become interested in it. The UV light has been used in the industry e.g. for deposition of
metal, semiconducting, and insulation films, hardening or curing of paints, varnishes,
pigments, and inks on paper or even textile fabric surfaces (Kogelschatz et al., 1991; Neral
et al., 2006).

2.5.3 Cross-linking additives
Sometimes it is needed to prevent unwanted polymerization, for example, during storage.
For that, some quinones or mono/polyhydric phenols can be added to ensure stability
(Murphy, 2001). Some compounds, on the other hand, speed up or initiate the crosslinking or curing of a polymer. One such example is a photoinitiator. It is a molecule that
absorbs light and either directly or indirectly generates reactive species that then lead to
the polymerization or cross-linking of a material. For the photoinitiator to be effective the
absorbance spectrum of the initiator should be a good match for the emission spectrum of
the light source (Stansbury, 2000).
The photoinitiators used in this work were 2-hydroxy-4'-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2methylpropiophenone, i.e. Irgacure 2959 or I2959 and Lithium phenyl-2,4,6trimethylbenzoylphosphinate, i.e. LAP. These both work in the range of ultraviolet light,
but their absorbance curves differ slightly as can be seen from Figure 10. Irgacure 2959
is more commonly used as a photoinitiator for hemicellulose (Fairbanks et al., 2009).

Figure 10 a) Chemical structures and absorption spectrums for b) Irgacure 2959 and
c) LAP (Fairbanks et al., 2009)
Other kinds of additives that are used for cross-linking purposes are chain
extenders and cross-linkers. Both additives function with the same intent to link two
polymer chains together with ionic or covalent bonds. The difference between chain
extender and cross-linker is the number of functional groups that can form the cross-links
between different polymer chains. The chain extender has two functional groups whereas
a cross-linker has three or more (Hanson & Wypych, 2019). In this work, one chain
extender vinyl methacrylate and one cross-linker PETMP (THIOCURE®) i.e.
pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) were used.

2.6 Goals of the master’s thesis
This master’s thesis had several goals regarding the raw material, modification methods,
and end properties. These goals were:
o To modify the properties of the hemicellulose raw material to more correspond to
the conservative plastic material properties
o Use non-toxic chemicals and sustainable methods in the modification process
o Increase in the modified material’s plasticity, i.e. mechanical strength, tensile
strength, elasticity, and toughness
o Decrease the material’s water solubility, i.e. increase hydrophobicity
o Improve the film-forming quality either as free-standing films or as a coating on
a substrate surface or both
It was not defined in advance whether a thermoplastic or thermoset material was
preferred. Also, the area of use was kept broad in the early stages of the project, but the
targets were, for example, in the food packaging industry. Due to the novelty of the
experiments, the scope and ideas were developed as the work progressed.

3.1 Materials

Hemicelluloses
The raw material, the xylan extract, was isolated by using a specific pressurized hot water
extraction process, the BLN-process, operated by the CH-Bioforce Oy (von Schoultz,
2014). The wood chips used in the extraction originated from the birch tree (Betula sp.).
The solids content of the delivered water-based extract was 20%. The unmodified xylan
was precipitated from five liters of the hemicellulose extract by using 20 liters of technical
ethanol (96%). The precipitate was allowed to sediment overnight where after about eight
liters of the ethanol-water solution was removed from above the sediment and an
additional five liters of ethanol were added to the system. The precipitate was left to settle
for three days and then about 15 liters of the ethanol-water solution was removed from
the surface. The precipitate was washed twice by adding more ethanol and removing the
dark ethanol-water phase. The precipitate in the form of a slurry was then transferred into
a vacuum oven and dried for five days. After drying the hard-caramelized pieces were
pulverized.

Chemicals
Xylitol (Fluka), sorbitol (Fluka), or glycerol (J.T. Baker) were used as external
plasticizers when producing films and coatings. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were
previously prepared in the research group of wood and paper chemistry by acid
hydrolysis. Sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (VWR chemicals) and citric acid
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used when creating films in an autoclave. Methacrylic anhydride
(Aldrich) was used for the chemical modification of xylan and sodium hydroxide (VWR
chemicals) or ammonia (Merck) was used to control the pH. The curing and cross-linking
of the functionalized xylan materials with UV radiation was studied by using two
photoinitiators, Irgacure 2959 (Alrich) and LAP (Aldrich), as well as two cross-linkers,
vinyl methacrylate (Merck) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP)
(Sigma-Aldrich). The water used was distilled unless otherwise mentioned. All chemicals
were used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned.

3.2 Methods
A schematic illustration of the different stages and analysis done during this master’s
thesis is presented in Figure 11 below.

Figure 11 Schematic presentation of the experimental work done
3.2.1 Films of unmodified xylan and external plasticizers
Several different compositions were used and evaluated when producing xylan-based
films. The films were all prepared in the same way. Most of them had a binary polyol
mixture 1:1 of xylitol and sorbitol as external plasticizers. Also, a limited number of films
were prepared with only glycerol as the plasticizer. The xylan was dissolved in water at
room temperature under constant stirring. The solids content of the different film
materials before casting was varied between 4.7% and 7%. The amount of added
plasticizers varied between 20% and 50%, of the dry amount of xylan. The plasticizers
were added to the water-xylan solution after xylan was fully dissolved. One composite
film was prepared with CNC. The nanocellulose was added to the solution as a prepared

Sara Kesäläinen

22

suspension with a 10% solids content. The films were cast by transferring the mixture
including all the components onto a Teflon-coated Petri dish and the mixture was left to
dry at room temperature.

Sodium hypophosphite and citric acid films
Two methods were investigated whether the xylan material could be cross-linked with
sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) and citric acid (CA). The first cross-linking trials were
made using 4 g of xylan, 0.4 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG), 0.2 g of CA, and 0.12 g of
NaH2PO2. These components were dissolved in 10 ml of water and poured on an
aluminum surface. The film was left to settle at room temperature for a few hours and
then it was transferred to an oven at 105°C for over 20 hours. After the material had dried,
it was cured in an oven at 150°C for about 10 minutes.
The other cross-linking method was conducted by using an autoclave. Again, 10
g of xylan, 10 g of glycerol, 0.1 g of CA, and 0.5 g of NaH2PO2 were mixed with 10 ml
of water at 50°C. Then the mixture was transferred to an autoclave where the reaction
continued at 120°C and elevated pressure for 1 hour. After the one hour, the autoclave
was turned off, the pressure and temperature were decreased to ambient where after then
the viscous solution was poured on four Teflon-coated Petri dishes. Two of the Petri
dishes were left to dry at room temperature and the other two were dried in an oven with
air circulation at 40°C. The drying of the material took about 3 days in the oven after it
came off easily from the Teflon surface.

3.2.2 Chemical modification with methacrylate anhydride in aqueous phase
The chemical modification of xylan using methacrylate anhydride was conducted in a
similar manner as described in Xu’s doctoral thesis for GGM (Xu, W., 2019). Xylan was
dissolved in water in a round bottom flask using constant stirring at 50°C. When the xylan
was fully dissolved the methacrylic anhydride was added and the pH adjusted to 8 by
adding diluted sodium hydroxide or ammonia. The concentration of the used NaOH was
5M or 10 M and the concentration of NH4OH solution 12.5 M. Several different reaction
conditions were tested. The different experiment parameters are presented in Table 2.
The reaction was continued for three hours during which the pH was constantly
adjusted to 8 by adding more alkali. After 3 h, the reaction product was precipitated using
ethanol according to the method described below. One reaction product was, instead of
ethanol precipitation, mostly isolated using dialysis with a 12-14 kDa membrane. The
dialysis was performed in distilled water for two weeks while the water was changed a
few times per day in the beginning, and once per day towards the end. The dialyzed

material was dried by freeze-drying and stored in the cold room covered with aluminum

Precipitation and drying of modified material
The chemically modified xylan was recovered from the reaction mixture by precipitation
using an anti-solvent, in this case, ethanol (96 vol-%), with the ratio 80:20, ethanol:water.
The precipitated material was filtered off with a black ribbon filter paper and the filter
cake was washed with ethanol, methanol, and technical acetone. The solid material was
left to dry at room temperature overnight and then transferred into a vacuum oven for
about half an hour. The dry material was pulverized to obtain a white powdery material,
which was then stored in the cold room, shielded from light.

3.2.3 Modified xylan samples for UV cross-linking
The material for UV cross-linking was prepared from the modified xylans. One control
material was also made by using unmodified xylan.
Different compositions and mixtures were tested to find the best properties for the
UV radiated product. Polyol mixtures of xylitol:sorbitol, 1:1, or glycerol were tested as
plasticizers. When a mixture of xylitol and sorbitol was used, the amount of combined
polyols were 50% of the dry xylan mass. The polyols were weighed separately and added
to the xylan powder. When glycerol was used as a plasticizer, it was weighed into the

Sara Kesäläinen

Experimental

24

xylan–water-slurry. Glycerol was used in a 1:1 ratio of the dry xylan mass. Other
substances, i.e. cross-linker and a photoinitiator, were weighed separately and added to
the slurry. Calculated from dry xylan powder, 5% of cross-linker and 0.5% of the
photoinitiator were used.
Method for the addition of photoinitiator and cross-linker was dependent on their
water solubility. Irgacure 2959 and PETMP are not water-soluble and therefore they were
pre-dissolved in a small amount of methanol. The methanol solution and water were
mixed with a vortex mixer and then added onto the dry xylans and polyols. The LAP
photoinitiator and vinyl methacrylate cross-linker have better water solubility, so they
could be first dissolved in water and thereafter added together into the mixture of xylans
and polyols.
The water solubility of the xylan polymer was changed due to the modification.
The higher the degree of substitution was, the less water-soluble the xylan polymer
appeared to be. Some of the materials needed heating to be dissolved in water. The
solutions were prepared by heating the mixtures in a 70°C oven for 5-10 min and stirred
using a vortex. Some samples produced a foam on top of the liquid phase, so they were
set in the shaker until the foam had collapsed before the material was used for any tests
or radiated.
The dry content was increased by adding less water into the mixture, which led to
a suspension with about 30% dry content. A small amount of technical grade DMSO was
added to improve the solubility and prevent the foaming effect. These formulations were
used to produce free-standing pieces of “bio-plastic” or alternatively coated on a cellulose
filter paper surface for studying the barrier properties of the material.
The samples were exposed to UV light from Honle UV-LED laser, in the
wavelength of 365 nm. Distance from the sample, time, and intensity of the radiation were
the parameters that were varied during the radiation. The varied parameters and their
effect on the cross-linking have been summarized in Table 4.

3.2.4 Coating of a cellulose surface with the modified xylan material
The dry material content, of the modified xylan slurry used to coat cellulose filter papers
(grade 1 qualitative), was 30%. Pure cellulose surface was used instead of a normal copy
paper in order to ensure high affinity between the coating substrate and paper substrate
and to prevent filling agents or other additives from interfering.
The suspension with 2 g of 1:3-conc. xyl-MA, 2 g of glycerol, 0.1 ml of vinyl
methacrylate, 10 mg of LAP, 2 ml of technical grade DMSO, and 4 ml of distilled water
was prepared in a beaker while heating and constantly stirring using a magnet stirrer. The
suspensions were transferred into 10 ml or 5 ml syringes and applied to the cellulose filter
paper base.

Sara Kesäläinen

The coating layer was applied with a K Control Coater (RK Printcoat
Instruments) using different speeds and wire-wound bars. The close wound bars 2, 4, and
6 were used, which have the wet film deposit thicknesses of 12 µm, 40 µm, and 60 µm,
respectively.
Immediately after the coating layer had been applied the coated paper was exposed
to UV light. Depending on the shape and size of the coated area, it was either held still
under a stationary UV light or slowly glided under the light source, as it would have been
on a conveyor.
Some of the samples were left to dry at room temperature and some were dried
immediately after the UV treatment. The drying was done with an infrared light source
with 6 W power situated about 20 cm above the dried surface.

Free-standing pieces
The free-standing pieces of modified xylan material were prepared from a similar
suspension as described above for coating material. The material was spread on a Tefloncoated Petri dish and irradiated with UV for 180 seconds. Immediately after the gelation,
the solid piece was detached from the Teflon surface and turned around. The other side
was irradiated for 120 seconds and removed from the Teflon surface. The piece was left
to dry at room temperature with as little contact to the coating surface as possible to
prevent cracking during drying.

3.3 Determination and analysis

3.3.1 Sugar content
The monomeric sugar composition of the xylan hemicellulose material (extract and
precipitated) was determined by performing acid methanolysis and gas chromatography
(Sundberg et al., 1996). All samples were made as duplicates.
In the acid methanolysis method, the samples were freeze-dried and weighed into
vessels. The calibration solution, including 0.1 mg/ml of the sugar units Glc, Xyl, Gal,
Man, Rha, Ara, GlcA, and GalA in methanol, was added to another vessel and dried under
a nitrogen gas flow. The actual methanolysis reagent, 2 M HCl in dry methanol, was
added and left to react in sealed vessels at 100°C, in an oven for 3 hours. The samples
were cooled down and the excess HCl was neutralized with pyridine. Internal standards
were added containing 0.1 mg/ml of sorbitol, resorcinol, and pentaerythritol. Again, the
samples were dried under a nitrogen gas flow and subsequently placed in a vacuum oven.
The silylation was done by adding pyridine after which the vessels were shaken
and immersed in an ultrasonic bath briefly. Then, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and
trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added and the samples were thoroughly shaken in a
vortex mixer and by immersing in an ultrasonic bath. The samples were left to sediment
overnight and the next day the liquid phase of the samples was transferred to the gas
chromatography.
The gas chromatography instrument used was a GC PerkinElmer AutoSystemXL
and the columns were HP-1, 25 m (L) x 0.200 mm (ID), film thickness 0.11 µm and HP5, 25 m (L) x 0.199 mm (ID), film thickness 0.11 µm. The carrier gas used was hydrogen,
injector pressure 14 psi and the injection volume was 1 µl, split ratio 25:1. The
temperature program during the analysis was 100°C (1 min), rate 4°C/min, 170°C,
12°C/min, 300°C (10 min). The temperature in the injector was 250°C and in the FID
detector 310°C. The results were calculated with TotalChrom software (PerkinElmer,
Inc).
To ensure the comparability of samples, a correction factor was calculated. It was
calculated for every sugar separately by comparing the peak areas of a specific
carbohydrate monomer to the area of the calibration according to Equation 1. No
calibration for the 4-O-methyl-glucuronic acid was available, so an average of the
correction factors for glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid was used.

3.3.2 Molar mass
Determination of the molar mass of the xylan hemicellulose material was performed with
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Waters UltrahydrogelTM 125/500 columns in
combination with a multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector. The sample
preparation was made by dissolving the freeze-dried samples in deionized (18 M MΩ)
water (3 mg/ml) using a shaker overnight to ensure that also the high-molar fractions were
dissolved. The samples were filtered through a nylon filter with a porosity of 2 µm. The
eluent used, 0.1 M NaNO3 was prepared and filtered through a 0.02 µm filter to avoid
particles that can disturb the laser detector. The injection amount used was 100 µl and the
flow rate was 0.5 ml/min.
The molar mass was calculated using pullulan calibration samples and Equation
2 received from the linear estimation from the pullulan samples. In the equation, x is the
retention time. The chromatograms of the xylan materials are shown in Figure 13.
Equation 2
𝐿𝑜𝑔10 𝑀 = −0,24528762 ∗ 𝑥 + 11,64572352
The degree of polymerization (DP) for the xylan polymers was calculated from
the molar mass results, according to Equation 3. The Mw(xylose) and Mw(water) can be either
calculated or searched from the literature.

3.3.3 NMR
The modified materials were characterized using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
instrument. All the NMR experiments were performed at 298 K in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker
AVANCE III spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C.
About 100 mg of the samples were freeze-dried until dryness and dissolved in 0.7 mL
DMSO-d6. The solution was slightly heated when transferred into NMR tubes. In order
to achieve quantitative carbon spectra, samples were analyzed for 14-15 h with the
number of scans 4100. The quantitative 13C experiments were recorded using a 5 mm Zgradient BBO (Broadband Observe) cryoprobe and a 10 s pulse delay (D1 = 10 s).
The anomeric carbon signal was used as the calibration point for the calculation
of the DS. For the different materials and integrals of the carbonyl C=C double bond as
well as the methyl signal peaks were used to determine the DS in the modified xylans.
The spectra for each sample from the 13C NMR analysis are shown in the Appendices (0).

3.3.4 DSC
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the thermal properties of
the modified and cross-linked xylan materials. The used instrument was a TA instruments
DSC250. Runs were conducted under a constant nitrogen gas flow of 50 ml/min. The
materials that were tested were the precipitated unmodified raw material xylan, modified
1:3 xyl-MA without any UV treatment, UV treated 1:2 xyl-MA, UV treated 1:3 xyl-MA,
UV treated 1:3 xyl-MA with glycerol as a plasticizer, UV treated 1:4 xyl-MA, and UV
treated 1:5 xyl-MA. The used pan was an aluminum Tzero and the lid was a hermetic
aluminum lid with a pinhole.
All the samples included water, so during the first heating cycle of the sample,
evaporation of water from the samples was conducted. The runs started from -50°C and
to evaporate the water inside the samples, the temperature was ramped up 20°C/min to
125°C and kept there isothermally for 5 minutes. Then the temperature was taken up to
150°C with a slower rate of 10°C/min and kept there isothermally for 1 min. The meaning
of that ramp up was to present that the curve after evaporation was back at the baseline.
The cooling of the sample was done from 150°C to -50°C at the rate of 20°C/min. The
second heating was conducted evenly by heating from -50°C to 200°C with the ramp of
20°C/min, except the unmodified raw material, which was heated up from -20°C to 180°C
due to its lower decomposition temperature.

3.3.5 Properties of the modified xylan-coated filter paper
Some properties of the cellulose filter papers that were coated with xylan and cross-linked
were determined and compared to the pure cellulose filter paper (grade 1). Due to the
limited amount of test material, some samples were not suitable for some measurements.
Also, in most cases only three duplicate measurements were conducted to one sample, so
the standard deviation does not produce a reliable result. Therefore, the standard deviation
is not presented in the results.

Mechanical properties
The area of the papers was measured, and the samples were weighed. The grammage was
calculated by Equation 4 and the values were used in the tensile strength measurements.

The thickness of the paper samples was measured with an L&W Micrometer
(Lorentzen & Wettre Products) at three different locations of each paper. The average of
the three measurements is the reported thickness value.
Tensile strength and elongation at break were measured with an L&W Tensile
strength tester (Lorentzen & Wettre Products). The paper samples were cut into standardsized pieces. The measurements were conducted three times for each paper grade. The
given values are calculated by the instrument and are averages from the three tests.

Air permeability
Air permeability was measured with an L&W Air Permeance Tester (Lorentzen & Wettre
Products) and three measurements were conducted for each sample. Unfortunately, some
of the samples were too small in diameter to cover the whole measuring area and therefore
were not measured. The given values are calculated by the instrument and are the average
of all three measurements.

Microscopic imaging
The surfaces of the uncoated and coated filter papers were magnified with a Nikon Eclipse
E200 microscope. The CFI E Plan Achromat objectives with a 4x, 10x, and 40x
magnification were used. These have the numerical aperture (N.A.) of 0.10, 0.25, and
0.65, respectively.

Contact angle
Cobb’s test did not produce measurable results, so the contact angle was measured
instead, to study the water permeability. The contact angle measurement was conducted
with a CAM 200, KSV NIMA from Biolin Scientific Oy with a 4 µl droplet. The timedependent contact angle was measured from the filmed video and the water transfer rate
on top or into the paper was observed. Also, the free-standing pieces’ hydrophobicity was
measured with the contact angle measurement.

4.1.1 Sugar content in extract and precipitate
Results from the gas chromatography confirmed suppositions and showed that
hemicelluloses in the extract received from the BLN-process of birch tree as well as the
precipitated material consisted mostly of xylans and very small amounts of other
carbohydrate monomers. This can also be seen in Figure 12.

Calculations with a correction factor showed that the percentage of xylose units out
of the total amount of sugar units in the extract and precipitated xylan was 78% and 80%
respectively. Most of the other sugar monomers did precipitate with the xylans, but not
to an equally high degree. This indicates that some of the non-xylose units were in the
extract as low molar mass substances, even as monomers or oligomers, and these did not
precipitate with the xylan. Some units, such as the glucuronic acid monomers, which are
associated with the xylan, precipitated to an equally high degree as the xylose units. On
the other hand, a lot less arabinose was found in the precipitate than in the xylan extract,
which indicates that arabinose occurs to a large extent as monomers or oligomers and
therefore it was not precipitated to the same level.

4.1.2 Molar mass determination
The molar mass distribution was more narrow for the precipitated xylan due to the loss
of low molar mass fraction, which does not precipitate from water into ethanol. The
results are presented in Figure 13 as the refractive index in relation to the retention time
measured with laser in MALLS.

Figure 13 The results from molar mass determination with SEC-MALLS presented in a
graph with hemicellulose extract and precipitated xylan
Results from the analysis with SEC-MALLS (Figure 13) and calculation with
Equation 2 showed that both the hemicellulose extract and the precipitated xylans were
of high molar mass, i.e. Mw over 8 000 and 12 000 g/mol, respectively. The average
degree of polymerization of xylans in this study was 61 for extract and 91 for precipitated
xylans. Some problems occurred during the measurement, caused by particles in the
sample (seen in Figure 13 at approximately 22 minutes). For that reason, the pullulan
calibration curve was used to achieve the values presented above.

4.2 Films of unmodified xylans with additives

4.2.1 Films with external plasticizers
Pure xylan had a poor film-forming ability. By adding external plasticizers such as xylitol,
sorbitol, or glycerol the film-forming ability could be somewhat improved, but the films
were still quite brittle and had poor mechanical properties. The amount of added external
plasticizers had a significant difference as can be seen from Figure 14, which presents
pictures of externally plasticized films formed by unmodified xylan.

Figure 14 Pictures of films with externally plasticized xylan with 20% of polyols (left),
and with 50% of polyols (right). Percentages calculated on dry xylan mass.
The addition of plasticizers to increase the film-forming ability works up to a
point. The problems occur if the properties should stay constant during a longer period or
if the material is in contact with water or other polar solvents. The plasticizers only
prevent the xylan polymer chains from aggregating and create more free volume between
the chains. Because the polymer chains in the films are not by any means fixed to place
or attached to each other, the small polyol molecules migrate away from the structure,
which causes the material properties to decrease over time. The same happens when the
film is introduced to water. The material is still as hydrophilic as before forming the film
and that means that it is equally water-soluble.

4.2.2 Composite films with nanocellulose
Films were also prepared as a composite of unmodified xylans and nanocellulose. These
films were smooth and had better strength properties than the unmodified xylan-polyol
films (4.2.1). As Figure 15 shows the composite films had also high opacity.

Percentages calculated on dry xylan mass.
In literature, it is also stated that xylan films are mostly improved if some other
carbohydrate polymer such as chitosan or cellulose is added (Gabrielii et al., 2000). It
prevents xylan from forming aggregates, which causes the film to crack (Linder et al.,
2003). The same phenomenon can be noted when xylan film or suspension is dried on
paper (Peresin et al., 2012). Figure 16 shows an illustration of this phenomenon.

al., 2003)
This thesis aimed to increase the plasticity of xylans, which could be done
momentarily by external plasticization, but after a while when the plasticizers escape from
the material it becomes brittle again and cracks. This happens even with CNC as

Sara Kesäläinen

reinforcement, because the xylan chains and polyols or nanocellulose are not bonded
together by any means. The external plasticization did not either make the xylan material
less hydrophilic, which was another goal of this work.

4.2.3 Films with sodium hypophosphite and citric acid
Cross-linking of polysaccharides by sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) and citric
acid (CA) has been reported for other carbohydrate polymers, such as cellulose and starch
(Azeredo et al., 2015; de Cuadro et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2015). In this work, it was studied
if the same method would be useful for xylan cross-linking. When films were prepared
with NaH2PO2 and CA, the aim was to cross-link the xylan material mildly with itself and
the plasticizers in a one-pot reaction. The first method had PEG as a plasticizer, and the
solution was cast and dried. After drying the product was cured, but it shattered and did
not produce an acceptable film. The material was almost burned-like pieces as they were
taken out of the 150°C oven. The water solubility did not decrease either.
The other method, which was performed in an autoclave, was more successful. The
reaction took only an hour, but the drying of the material was a long process. Even in
40°C oven with air circulation the material did not come off the Teflon surface before
3 days had passed. After drying the material was flexible and tough and otherwise
plastic-like in many ways, as can be seen in Figure 17. The film could be melted in an
oven set just under 200°C after which it was re-moldable. Also, the heating and remolding
process was repeatable. Unfortunately, no time remained for DSC tests. The material was
water-soluble, although not immediately but after a few minutes.

Figure 17 Pictures of the xylan films prepared in an autoclave with NaH2PO2 and CA
The material prepared in an autoclave was interesting, but it still did not fill all the
aims that were set for this work. Some future research could be done for this material as
well, but the focus in this work was placed on the chemical modification of xylans done
in aqueous phase with methacrylic anhydride.

4.3 Chemical modification experiments

4.3.1 Experiment with methacrylic anhydride in aqueous phase
The main reactions that take place during the chemical modification are esterification of
the hydroxyl groups in xylan (1), hydrolysis of the anhydride (2), and neutralization of
the acid released in the first and second reaction by alkali and the formation of salt (3).
The reactions are illustrated in Figure 18. The desired reaction is the esterification of the
hydroxyl groups in the xylan as the objective was to try to reach as high DS as possible.
Also, deacetylation is a possible reaction that can take place during the modification.

Figure 18 The three different reactions taking place during the modification of xylan
with methacrylic anhydride: Esterification of the hydroxyl groups in xylan (1),
hydrolysis of the anhydride (2), and neutralization of the acid by alkali (3)
All the different modification experiments were stable and similar to each other
except for the 1:5 xyl-MA experiment (see Table 2). This particular experiment was
conducted with the highest concentration of xylans and methacrylic anhydride in the

Sara Kesäläinen

36

reaction solution. The more vigorous experiment, in the case with 1:5 xyl:MA, was
observed by a much faster consumption of the alkali needed to adjust the pH and the
exothermic behavior overheating the reaction solution from the desired setpoint, 50°C, to
approximately 60°C. The stability of the other experiments may be caused by a larger
amount of water, which has the capability to dilute the acid formed from methacrylate
anhydride and to remove heat from the reaction solution.
The yield of isolated xylans from the modification experiments were about 44%,
which is unreasonably low, especially when talking about industrial-size production. It
would not be profitable if only 44 kg of modified material could be produced out of
100 kg of raw material xylan. One solution to this problem might be to increase the
concentration of xylans in water before precipitation in ethanol and that way to improving
the precipitation rate. Some other more nonpolar anti-solvent could also be tested, e.g.
acetone might work better than the ethanol used in this work.

4.3.2 Degree of substitution
The quantitative carbon NMR spectra of the different modified materials can be seen in
Figure 19.

Sara Kesäläinen

Results and discussion

37

The spectrum of the unmodified raw material xylan is presented at the bottom of
Figure 19 in blue color. The five peaks between 60 and 102 ppm are the carbon atoms in
the sugar ring. The DMSO solvent peak is presented at 39.5 ppm and used as a reference
point in the spectra. The lowest and highest peaks at 21, 169.5, and 173.7 are from the
acetyl groups and hexuronic acid, which are substituted in the xylan chain at C2 and C3
positions. The peak at 21 is the methyl part of the acetyl group and 169.5 is the carbonyl
part. The small peak at 173.7 is the carbonyl carbon at the carboxylic acid of the hexuronic
acid substituent.
Proof of the chemical modification was visible in the NMR quantitative carbon
spectra. The deacetylation of the xylan chains takes place during the experiment, which
is shown as a shrinking of the acetyl group peaks in Figure 19. As the methacrylate groups
substitute either the acetyl groups or hydroxyl groups in the C2 and C3 positions of the
xylan chains, it creates new peaks to the spectrum at 165, 136, 126, and 18 ppm.
The red spectrum in Figure 19 shows that the modification experiment in which
ammonia was used as the base, to adjust the pH, did not produce any chemically modified
product. This result was a little surprising while it was not expected that the selection of
alkali should have a big negative effect on the reaction outcome. But apparently, ammonia
is not suitable to use for the esterification of xylan with methacrylic anhydride. One
possible explanation might be the changes in the electrostatic environment as the
positively charged sodium ions are missing from the ammonia solution. Changes in
charges may affect the polymer’s tertiary configuration and accessibility of the hydroxide
groups in the xylan chain, although, no proof of this was found. Another possibility is that
the alkali otherwise affects the reaction mechanism and hinders the esterification reaction.

When the integral of the peak region at 102 ppm was set to 1, integrals of the other
peaks at 173.7, 169.5, 165, 136, 126, 21, and 18 ppm revealed the degree of substitution
and the degree of deacetylation. The values are presented in Table 3. The original spectra
are presented in Appendices. Even though the quantitative NMR carbon method is not
fully guaranteed to be perfectly quantitative, it is exact enough to give reliable information

Sara Kesäläinen

about the substitution degree. It would be good to in future research double-check the
results with another method as well, for example, titration.
As named before, the methacrylate groups have two possible places for
substitution in the xylan sugar ring, at the C2 and C3 positions. That is why the theoretical
maximum for DS is 2. In that case, every single xylan monomer would have two
methacrylate groups as substituents and no hydroxyl groups or hexuronic acids would be
left. The highest DS that was achieved in this study was 0.76, which means that at least
one methacrylate group is attached to every other xylan monomer and still some acetyl
groups are left as well.

Water solubility
Due to the stronger reaction conditions, especially the 1:5 xyl-MA showed a higher DS,
as can be seen from Table 3. This also caused the 1:5 xyl-MA to have a lower solubility
in water as well as DMSO. The concentration of xylans in DMSO-d6 was the same as in
the other samples, but the viscosity of the 1:5 xyl-MA sample became too high for the
NMR experiment. Due to that, the peaks in the NMR spectrum were not as sharp as in the
other spectra. As the degree of substitution increases, the water solubility decreases.
If the desire would be to make even more hydrophobic material, the water
solubility of the xylan could be decreased more by either increasing the DS or substituting
larger hydrophobic substituents (Whistler, 1973). The DS could be made higher in an
organic solvent instead of water, where the chemistry of the experiment would be
different.

As can be seen from Table 4, all such materials that had the modified xylan
material and the other photoactive substances did form a cross-linked material that
appeared as a gel right after radiation. Another parameter that affected the cross-linking
was the concentration of the modified xylans in water. The higher the concentration was,
the better the gelation, i.e. a higher degree of cross-linking took place even during short
periods of radiation. Also, the materials seemed to be stronger and have lower water
solubility, although no tensile strength or hydrophobicity results were recorded.
The time and intensity of UV irradiation were assessed, and no extra tests were
focused on the optimization or the irradiation parameters. In the case of the coated papers,
the distance from the paper was restricted to the area of radiation because as the light
source was moved closer to the paper, the area of radiation became too small to cover the
whole material surface. Better and faster radiation could possibly be achieved if the light
source would be a plate or otherwise better shaped to suit the radiation of larger surfaces.
Radiation time, concentration, and the effect of other added materials such as
cross-linker or photoinitiator should be more investigated. For example, an investigation
of viscosity versus time under radiation would give more insight into the degree of crosslinking and whether the mostly used three minutes were enough to produce a well cross-

linked material. As the cross-linking degree is an important factor in the behavior and
properties of the material, it should be further investigated.

Additives
Different additives were tested during the irradiation cross-linking of the modified xylanbased materials. From the radiation reactions seen in Table 4, photoinitiator Irgacure 2959
was used in reactions 2 and 3, and LAP was used in 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. At first
Irgacure 2959 was used because it was found from literature where similar tests had been
previously made. After a few radiation tests, the photoinitiator was changed to LAP due
to its better water solubility and a more appropriate absorbance curve at the UV
wavelengths that were used (Fairbanks et al., 2009).
The two different cross-linkers were compared in reactions 2 and 3 (in Table 4),
and at first, the pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) i.e. PETMP seemed to be
more effective. However, when higher concentrations of modified xylans were used, the
vinyl methacrylate showed to be nearly as effective. The vinyl methacrylate was watersoluble and more environmentally friendly chemical to use because unlike PETMP, it
does not contain sulfur. That is why vinyl methacrylate was used in the rest of the
radiation reactions as cross-linker (1, 4-11).

4.5 Thermal properties of the cross-linked materials
The DSC measurements were conducted twice due to the findings of big endothermic
valleys from the first measurement curves (one example shown in Figure 20). These
valleys were concluded to be water from the samples evaporating as the samples were
heated. Besides, some of the samples were heated to too high temperature, which leads to
the decomposition of the material. After the sample starts to decompose, the second
heating round does not produce reliable and reproducible information.

Figure 20 DSC measurement curve of unmodified xylan from the first measurement
round
All the samples included water, which showed in the curves as a big endothermal
valley (see Figure 20). The water evaporation started at after 50°C. Both the unmodified
and 1:3 modified xyl-MA without UV treatment showed a much larger valley, at lower
temperatures, whereas the materials that had been UV treated had a more subtle valley
that started also at a higher temperature (see an example in Figure 23). This is probably
due to the cross-linking of the material where water molecules are captured into the
polymerized structure. Water functions as a small molecular size plasticizer in the
polymer material. Water’s plasticizing feature could be noted in a few of the DSC curves
(curves in appendix 0) in a way that the Tg changed to a higher temperature after the water
had been evaporated. Due to the water disturbing the glass transition temperature
measurement, a second measurement was conducted and the result for the same material
sample is shown in Figure 21.

Figure 21 DSC measurement curve of unmodified raw material xylan after the
evaporation stage from the second measurement round
During the second measurement, water was evaporated, and the temperature was
kept below the decomposition temperature for all samples, to ensure that the results were
reliable and reflected the material properties. One test run was done on the unmodified
xylan where the sample was heated, cooled, and heated again after the water had been
removed. The received curve demonstrates that the data is reliable as the same line is
produced twice during both heating runs (Figure 21). This phenomenon also proves that
the sample was dry. The graphs from the dried samples were collected into one graph,
which is shown in Figure 22. All the individual graphs are presented in Appendices (0).

Figure 22 DSC measurement curves of all samples after evaporation stage from the
second measurement round
The glass transition temperature was found for three of the UV treated samples
(shown in Figure 22). For these materials, the Tg was found to be between 7°C and 11°C,
slightly decreasing with the increasing DS. The material 1:2 xyl-MA, 1:4 xyl-MA, and

Sara Kesäläinen

43

1:5 xyl-MA had the Tg’s at 10.14°C; 8.55°C and 7.59°C, respectively. The reason why
the 1:3 xyl-MA did not show a Tg during the measurements was not clear and could not
be explained. One possible explanation for the sample with glycerol can be that its Tg
could be outside of the measuring range, possibly below -50°C.
The DSC measurements showed that the pure precipitated xylan does not
crystallize or have a clear Tg in the temperature range of -20°C to 180°C. The fact that the
sample showed no signs of crystallization is supported by the literature (Gabrielii et al.,
2000). The non-crystallization can be explained with acetyl groups substituents that
prevent chain crystallization. The decomposition rate and temperature could have been
investigated with a TGA instrument, but the instrument was unfortunately out of order at
the time the experiments were conducted. The literature suggests and DSC measurements
(see Figure 23) support that the decomposition of pure xylan starts at about 200°C
(Fundador et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2013; Werner et al., 2014).

Figure 23 Comparison of the DSC graphs of unmodified xylan, 1:3 modified xyl-MA
without UV treatment, and 1:5 modified xyl-MA from the first measurement round
The measurement with TGA could not be conducted, but it can still be concluded
that the material is thermally stable under its decomposition temperature. Supported by
literature findings, the thermal stability can be increased by derivatization, chemical
modification, and cross-linking (Fundador et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2013). This was also
the case with the modified and unmodified xylan material. As can be seen from Figure
23, the unmodified xylan starts to degrade at lower temperatures compared to all the other
materials, already at about 200°C. The 1:3 xyl-MA, which has not been UV treated, only
chemically modified, starts to degrade at about 220°C. The 1:5 xyl-MA material with
cross-linking and the highest DS starts the degradation after 240°C. It needs to be noted
that in the results from the first measurements, some water was possibly still present in
the samples (for example in Figure 23), which might affect the thermal behavior.

The different parameters used for coating modified xylan on a filter paper followed by
UV treatment are listed in Table 5. The table shows that the wire bar no. 4 was mostly
used because it produced the smoothest coating surface on the cellulose filter paper. The
surface of the coated paper was light yellow/brown and sparkled gently (see Figure 24).
The marks from the wire bar were visible on some samples, especially on the coated paper
no. 4. The surface on the coated paper no. 4 was clearly white-yellow striped even to the
naked eye. Some unevenness was noticeable in samples 7. and 8. when observed more
closely under a good light.
The phenomenon of shrinking was noticeable in the coated products as they curled
up during drying. Some samples curled already during the drying with the IR and all
curled up to some degree during the following 24 hours. It is also a feature of a cellulosebased substrate when it is wetted on one side only. This curling can be the result of the
development of new hydrogen bonds in the base paper, between the base paper and the
xylan coating, as the water evaporates from the cross-linked polymer substrate.
Visually no differences in the coated papers were noted comparing between IR
drying and air drying at room temperature. The only difference was that drying with the
IR was faster. If the coating would be done on a larger scale, infrared drying as part of
the coating process would speed up the drying. It must be noted that the IR drying is a
surface drying method and it was most likely enough to dry thin coatings that were made
during this thesis. If the layer would be made thicker, it might not dry from the inside
before burning on the surface. In such cases, other drying methods might be more
practical.

As can be seen from the microscopic images in Figure 25, the base paper is a
highly porous material consisting of randomly organized cellulose fibers. The coating
material, in turn, is an even layer of a matrix that includes a vast number of air bubbles.
The material had a high viscosity, which led to the encapsulation of air into the material.
The air bubbles were captured and transferred with the material into the paper where they
evened out and integrated between the fibers.

paper, (G-I) double xylan-coated filter paper, and (J-K) dried and cross-linked xylancoating material with the magnifications of x4 (left), x10 (center), and x40 (right).
As the material was cross-linked, the bubbles also froze in position, followed by
drying of the material. During the drying, the bubbles cracked, which is visible in Figure
25K. The dried material had numerous concave half-bubbles integrated and fixed in
position by the cross-linked coating, which probably caused the material to sparkle as
light was shined on it. The bubbles refract and reflect the incoming waves of light with
all possible angles, the same way as diamonds or glitter, and in that way makes the surface
sparkly.
Even though the coating was a continuous matrix, it seems not to have covered
the paper surface evenly as the images D, E, G, and H in Figure 25 shows. Lighter and
darker areas are visible as light is shined through the coated paper. It can also be the result
of a thinly applied layer, which does not block light very well. To be able to reach definite

conclusions about the evenness of the coating, it would be necessary to take a microscopic
image of the precisely same spot of paper before and after coating to be able to subtract
the effect of randomly organized fibers.

Figure 26 Graph of the mechanical properties of the uncoated and xylan-coated filter
papers. Values are from Table 6.
An increase in the grammage in Figure 26 was an expected result and followed
somewhat proportionally the added amount of xylan substrate. The uncoated paper had
the lowest value, the coated papers no. 6 and no. 8, which had one layer of the coating
had almost the same value that was higher than the uncoated sample, whereas the doublecoated no. 7 had the highest value. The small difference between the grammage of no. 6
and no. 8 is due to the different rod numbers and the coating speed. The difference would
probably have been bigger if the papers had been coated with the same speed and different
rod number or vice versa. With higher speed and bigger rod (no. 6), little more of the
xylan suspension was left onto the base paper but the amount would have been even
bigger if the speed had been lower.
The difference between the thickness of the uncoated and once coated paper is
small (as seen in Table 6 and Figure 26), which indicates that the xylan coating substrate
penetrates the base paper. That way the applied coating layer does not increase the
thickness in the same manner as it does grammage. Another reason that might explain
this phenomenon is, when the rod applies pressure on the paper as the substrate is coated,
the paper may be pressed down slightly. As the wet cellulose substrate dries, new
intermolecular hydrogen bonds can be formed, which additionally supports the thinning
of the paper.
Tensile strength is the highest in the filter paper (see Table 6 and Figure 26). This
is due to the strong inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bond network between the
cellulose fibers. The coated papers had lower tensile strength, especially the double-

coated paper. It may be suspected that the xylan material has lower mechanical strength
than the paper substrate, which would lead to poorer tensile strength in the combined
material. It is also possible that the xylan-coating interferes with the hydrogen bond
network, which reduces the tensile strength of the base paper as well.
It needs to be noted that the test papers had not been held in the conditioned room
with controlled humidity (50%) long enough, according to standards, so tensile strength
and elongation values are not comparable to other cases. All the tested materials were,
however, equally treated so the values are comparable with each other.

4.7.3 Air permeability
The air permeability was measured to be an average of 2680 ml/min for the uncoated
filter paper. For the coated paper no. 5, it was measured to be 7.01 ml/min (not in Table
6) and for no. 6 it was 8.17 ml/min.
The air permeability thus decreased drastically as the filter paper was coated with
the cross-linked xylan coating. Already the addition of one layer of the xylan substrate
decreased the air permeability with 99.7%. The air permeability of the coated material
was 0.3% of the uncoated filter paper and 1.4% of normal copy paper. Measurements also
showed that the air permeability was higher towards the end of the coated paper. This is
caused by the rod coating, which leaves more of the coated substrate in the beginning, as
the coating substrate is not continuously added in front of the rod.
It was surprising to note how much the air permeability decreased with the coating
of the filter paper, especially after the microscopical images did not show a continuous
matrix of the coating substrate, on the contrary, a considerable amount of free space
seemed to exist between the cellulose fibers. Somehow, the xylan substrate blocks the air
through the cellulose fiber network very effectively. The concave, dried half-bubbles can
affect the air permeability as the air cannot flow through these bubbles. Even when
compared to newspaper and copy paper, which both have filling agents and other
materials that restrain the airflow through the paper, the values are almost ten times higher
than for the xylan-coated paper.

4.7.4 Hydrophobicity
Contact angle determination showed an increase in hydrophobicity of the coated filter
paper. Results can be seen as pictures from the contact angle measurement in Figure 27
and as a graph plotted from the contact angle values in Figure 28.

Figure 28 Contact angle measurement of pure cellulose filter paper and two xylan
coated filter papers during the first two seconds after a water droplet hit the surface
As can be seen from both figures 27 and 28, the filter paper absorbs water
extremely quickly. The droplet disappeared in less than one second. Both of the coated
papers that were tested resisted the water absorption much longer. The behavior of the
coated papers was quite similar in the first 10 seconds but after that the coating no. 8
started to absorb water slightly faster. This can also be seen in Figure 27 when comparing
the images e) and h) that have been taken 30 seconds after the droplet first touched the
surface.
The graph in Figure 28 shows that the coated paper no. 8 has a slightly higher
contact angle in the beginning. The most probable reason for both phenomena was the
difference in coating parameters (see Table 5). Paper no. 6 had more material and a thicker
coating because it was coated with a bar with deeper wires. Paper no. 8, in turn, was
probably more even due to slower coating speed and more frequently wired bar. For these
reasons the surface of the coated paper no. 8 was more hydrophobic during the first second
but after the water got through the thinner coating layer, it absorbed faster into the base
paper.
When looking at the two free-standing pieces (see 3.2.4), basically their only
difference is the small amount of added DMSO. From the contact angle measurement can
be concluded that the material without DMSO seems to be more hydrophobic. It needs to
be noted that both the materials were quite uneven and that caused some problems in the
contact angle measurement and interpretation of the results. Also, the piece with DMSO
was prepared some days after the material without DMSO, so the time of drying at room
temperature can play a role in the results of this measurement as well.

5 Conclusions
Unmodified xylan precipitate, which was used as a raw material in this study, cannot
produce films as such and even externally plasticized, with small-molecular plasticizers,
the film’s properties are not good. The film-forming quality can be somewhat increased
by forming a biocomposite, for example, with nanocellulose but if the different polymer
chains are not covalently bonded together by any means, the film will deteriorate with
time. The water-solubility is not affected either by just mixing the hydrophilic xylan
polymer with polyols or cellulose.
The results show that chemical modification of the xylan material is required for the
internal plasticization of the polymer, thereby increasing the plasticity and changing the
properties. When the hydroxyl groups in the xylan chains are substituted to bigger and
more hydrophobic side groups, the material becomes more applicable and hydrophobic.
It was also found during this study that the factors affecting the degree of substitution
were not only the ratio of xylan and methacrylic anhydride reagent but also the
concentration of xylans in water during the modification experiment.
The modified material was suitable to cross-link with ultraviolet light when it was
combined with a chain extender or cross-linker and a photoinitiator. Even a short
1-3-minute radiation time created enough cross-linking for the material to be held together
and in shape. This modified xylan was both used to create free-standing pieces and coated
on a filter paper and then cross-linked. The modified and cross-linked xylan coating
decreased drastically the air permeability of the filter paper. Also, hydrophobicity
increased even though the applied layer was very thin.
The modified and cross-linked xylan produced during this work was an interesting
material that still needs some research and development, but it has the potential to become
an industrial product. The material has the possibility of becoming a plastic replacement
in, for example, packaging for the food industry or cosmetics where non-toxicity is a
requirement. Besides, as all the possible barrier properties were not investigated, it may
have some features and advantages that are not yet known. After all, the chemically
modified xylan material may offer some solutions towards a more sustainable and plasticfree future.

6 Summary in Swedish – Svensk sammanfattning
Förbättrad plasticitet och filmbildning av xylaner genom en kemisk modifiering
utförd i vattenfas
I dagens värld har vi ständigt växande behov för material som kan ersätta plast
producerat av fossila råvaror, till exempel råolja. Bionedbrytbart material, producerat på
ett hållbart sätt av förnybara råvaror med likadana egenskaper som vanlig plast, skulle
vara en lösning på problemet. Detta diplomarbete utfördes för att bidra till kampen mot
plaster från fossila råvaror. Målet var att undersöka möjligheter att producera plast av
vedbaserad hemicellulosa. Detta gjordes genom att kemiskt modifiera xylaner för att få
ett material som skulle ha plastliknande egenskaper.
Råmaterialet som användes var xylanextrakt från finsk björk. Extraktet var
fraktionerat från ved med hjälp av en BLN-process av CH-Bioforce Oy och extraktet
innehöll xylaner med hög molmassa (Mw 12 kD) och polymerisationsgrad (91).
Xylanerna isolerades ur extraktet genom utfällning i teknisk etanol. Utfällningen torkades
och maldes, varefter den bildade ett ljusbrunt fint pulver. Xylanerna utfällda på detta sätt
bildade ingen film då de upplöstes i vatten och sedan torkades på en teflonyta. Då
mjukgörare som xylitol, sorbitol eller glycerol tillsattes, bildade materialet en film som
dock var spröd och svag.
För att kunna tillverka ett mer plastliknande material modifierades xylanerna
kemiskt i vattenfas. Xylanerna löstes upp i destillerat vatten under konstant omrörning
och förhöjd temperatur (50 °C). Metakrylsyrans anhydrid (MA) tillsattes till lösningen
och pH justerades till 8 genom kontinuerlig tillsats av NaOH. Efter att reaktionen hade
pågått i 3 timmar isolerades produkten genom utfällning i en stor mängd kall etanol.
Fällningen som bildades fick sedimentera över natten, varefter den filtrerades och
tvättades med etanol, metanol och aceton. Fällningen torkades först i luft och sedan i
vakuumugn i 40 °C. Det erhållna ljusa pulvret lagrades kallt och skyddades mot ljus.
Genom att förändra processparametrarna kunde substitueringsgraderna av de
modifierade xylanerna styras. De erhållna substitueringsgraden bestämdes med
kvantitativ kol-13-NMR. Deutererad DMSO användes som lösningsmedel i
bestämningen. Substitueringsgraden konstaterades vara mellan 0,14–0,63, då det
teoretiska maxvärdet är 2. De erhållna värdena samt acetylgruppernas hydrolysgrad var
beroende av förhållandet mellan xylan och MA-reagens, men påverkades också av
xylanernas koncentration i vattenlösningen. En skillnad i vattenlöslighet noterades för
material som hade låg eller hög mängd av substituerade metylmetakrylgrupper,
vattenlösligheten minskade då substitueringsgraden ökade. Orsaken till detta är
substitution av hydrofila hydroxylgrupper med hydrofoba metakrylgrupper.
Det modifierade xylanmaterialet formade en tvärbunden polymerstruktur efter
några minuters UV-bestrålning då den kombinerades med mjukgörare, tvärbindare och

Sara Kesäläinen

fotoinitiator. Samma material kunde också användas för att bestryka filterpapper och på
det sättet ändra papprets egenskaper. Eftersom torkning av materialet utan sprickor var
problematiskt, användes så hög torrhalt på bestrykningsmedlet som möjligt. Det ledde till
att beläggningsmaterialet var suspensionsliknande och hade hög viskositet. Den låga
vattenlösligheten av xylanerna förbättrades genom tillsats av en liten mängd DMSO.
Små luftbubblor stabiliserades inne i beläggningsmaterialet som gjorde att
fristående filmer hade lägre densitet än vatten och därför flöt på ytan. Också i bestruket
papper var de inkapslade bubblorna så stabila att de efter tvärbindning med UV-ljus var
synliga under mikroskop. Under torkning av beläggningen sprack bubblorna och blev
kvar som halva bubblor inne i matrisen. De tusentals bubblorna spred och bröt vitt ljus så
att den bestrukna pappersytan såg glittrig ut för blotta ögat.
Då det modifierade xylanmaterialet beströks på filterpapper, ändrades flera av
papprets egenskaper. Ytvikten hos det bestrukna pappret ökade linjärt beroende på hur
många bestrykningsskikt det fanns. Trots det, var en gång bestruket filterpapper inte
avsevärt tjockare än obestruket filterpapper vilket betyder att åtminstone en del av
beläggningsmaterialet tränger in i baspappret.
Den största förändringen i egenskaperna var i luftpermeabiliteten. Filterpapper är
ett poröst material som släpper igenom luft ganska lätt, över fyra gånger lättare än vanligt
kopieringspapper. Efter ett bestrykningsskikt av xylanmaterialet på filterpapper minskade
luftpermeabiliteten med 99,7 %. Det bestrykta filterpapperets luftpermeabilitetsvärde var
endast 1,4 % av värdet för vanligt kopieringspapper.
De mekaniska egenskaperna hos det bestrukna pappret ändrades endast lite.
Dragindexet försämrades lite medan töjningen ökade beroende av bestrykningen.
Eftersom filterpapper består av rena cellulosafibrer har den högt dragindex på grund av
interoch
intramolekylära
vätebindningar.
Under
bestrykningen
kan
vätebindningsstrukturen förstöras då xylanmaterialet tränger mellan cellulosafibrerna,
varpå dragindexet försämras. Å andra sidan är det plastliknande xylanmaterialet mer
elastiskt, så töjningen förbättrades.
Hydrofobiciteten mättes med kontaktvinkeltest. Bestrykningen av filterpapper
med xylanmaterialet ökade papprets hydrofobicitet. Precis som de modifierade xylanerna
blev mindre vattenlösliga då substitueringsgraden ökade, skedde detsamma för bestruket
papper och hydrofobiciteten ökade i samband med bestrykningen. De tvärbundna,
fristående xylanfilmerna var totalt olösliga i vatten och vattendroppen bara spreds på ytan.
Det tog 5–10 sekunder för kontaktvinkeln att bli konstant 20°–50°, lite beroende på
materialets innehåll.
Som slutsats kan konstaterats att materialegenskaperna förändrades och blev mer
plastiska efter en lyckad kemisk modifikation i vattenfas med metakrylsyrans anhydrid. I
detta arbete användes samma råmaterial under hela försöket, men
modifikationsreaktionen har påvisats fungera också för andra kolhydrater och andra typer
av hemicellulosa (Xu et al., 2018).

Summary in Swedish

Modifikationen av xylanerna fungerade men utbytet var ganska lågt (44 %), vilket
kan vara ett problem om man skulle vilja framställa denna produkt i industriell skala.
Ytterligare krävs det lika mycket extern mjukgörare d.v.s. glycerol som modifierade
xylaner, vilket är en annan nackdel. För framtidens undersökningar borde man fokusera
på att försöka få ännu högre substitueringsgrad genom att göra modifieringen i ett
organiskt lösningsmedel, till exempel DMSO. Då skulle man också kunna förbättra
tvärbindningen och på det sättet producera ett starkare material. För att kunna öka utbytet
efter modifieringen i vattenfas, skulle ett annat mer opolärt lösningsmedel kunna testas,
till exempel aceton, för att bättre kunna fälla ut också mer hydrofoba delar av det
modifierade materialet, som kanske är lösliga i etanol och därmed inte faller ut.
De modifierade xylanerna skulle kunna användas i industrin i olika tillämpningar
till exempel för bestrykning på papper eller kartong för ökade barriäregenskaper eller som
en fristående film. Xylanerna innehåller inte toxiska eller farliga kemikalier som skulle
hindra dess användning i till exempel livsmedelsindustrin. UV-ljus som
tvärbindningsmetod har använts med tanke på att det är ett lätt, allmänt och billigt sätt att
använda i produktion även i en större skala.
