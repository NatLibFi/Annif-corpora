ABSTRAKT
Automatiseringen av fabriker är ett världsomfattande fenomen som har växt från år till år. Det

här är en av orsakerna till varför optimerade leverantörskedjor är allt viktigare, ekonomiskt
men också med tanke på miljön.

Den optimerade leverantörskedjan har idag blivit ett måste för att man ska kunna nå
konkurrenskraftiga fördelar gentemot andra företag. I det här diplomarbetet kommer logistiken

delas upp i mindre delar för att skapa en ny process. Målet är att skapa en smidigare
leverantörskedja med ett miljövänligt synsätt samtidigt som avkastningen ökar.

Som metodologi har både kvantitativa och kvalitativa analyser använts, så som FMEA, fivewhys och fishbone diagram. Det här resulterar i en ny logistisk process som sparar både pengar
och miljö. Utsläppskalkyler, besparingar och en kontrollplan presenteras som resultat till följd
av detta arbete.

I diplomarbetet skapades en ny logistisk process för att sänka transport- och lagerkostnader
samtidigt som mera miljövänliga metoder tillämpades. Den uppnådda processen ger ett
jämnare materialflöde och därtill en kontrollplan för framtida förbättringar.
Nyckelord: Grön logistik, leverantörskedjor, utsläpp, materialflöde

ABSTRACT
Factory automation is a worldwide phenomenon growing from year to year. This is
one of the reasons why optimized supply chains become more and more important,
economically but also environmentally.

Optimized supply chains have become a crucial part of gaining competitive

advantages against other companies. In this thesis, the logistics process will be

divided into smaller sections when creating a new logistics process. The goal is to

create a smoother supply chain with a more environmentally friendly approach while
increasing the profit.

For the methodology, both qualitative and quantitative analysis such as FMEA, fivewhys and fishbone diagram have been used. This has resulted in a new logistics

process saving both money and the environment. Emission calculations, savings and
a control plan are presented as a result of this thesis.

In this thesis, a new logistics process was created to lower transportation and storage

costs while implementing greener logistics methods. The achieved process allows a
smoother inventory flow with a control plan enabling further optimization.

Key words: Green logistics, supply chain management, emissions,
material flow

INTRODUCTION

As the factory automation is growing worldwide it becomes increasingly important for
companies to optimize their material flows in order to gain advantages towards
competitors. The amount of materials imported from other countries is growing from

year to year and because of these two considerations, freight optimization is becoming

even more important focusing on a high-quality supply chain. This was also noted in
a study regarding transportation by Xiang Zhou et al. (2016:2): “With the worldwide
energy shortage, economic globalization, development of international logistics,

global warming and the protection of the ecosystem and environment, the research on
the optimization and strategic planning of the freightage network, development of the
freight collection and distribution system with the port as its center as well as the

optimization of the supply chain has become a hot-discussed topic and focus all over
the world.”

The importance of logistics is also noted by Bravo and Vidal (2013:1) in “Freight

transportation function in supply chain”: “Freight transportation is undoubtedly one of
the most studied issues in the scientific logistics literature to date, mainly because of
the high costs that this component typically generates compared with total logistics

costs faced by any kind of industry.” According to them, on average 64 per cent of

logistics costs result from transportation costs. This clearly indicates that freight
optimization should be considered as an important topic.

The above-mentioned factors have been detected at ABB Oy, Smart Power, which is

why the decision was made to investigate the possibilities of developing the logistics
process. ABB Oy, Smart Power, is a highly automated factory manufacturing electrical
switches for different needs. This factory is located in Vaasa, Finland, but the

manufactured switches are exported worldwide. In recent years, the manufacturing
process has been optimized during various production development projects and this
has created a strong need to optimize the logistics process as well. This Master´s thesis
is one of the recent projects with the aim of enabling further growth for the factory.

In their 2009 research, Zu et al. conclude: “The logistics industry becomes more and
more important in the national economy. It makes a rapid transition from the tradition

logistics to a modern logistics.” This sums up the intentions for this Master´s thesis,

to make a partial transition towards a more modern logistics process. As mentioned,
the volumes of imported materials have increased from year to year and in this

Master’s thesis the scope will be inbound logistics, focusing on a high-quality supply
chain. The most important objectives will be cost savings, flexibility, streamlined

processes and green supply chain management. The goal for this thesis is to create a
more reliable inbound freight while improving the efficiency of the current inbound

program. It is important to keep the green logistics in mind in the whole supply chain
and this is one of the aspects that will be taken into account. (Zu et.al, 2009:1)

“Today, climate change is the greatest challenge for future generations”. This is one

of the key statements in Aktas, Bloemhof and Fransoo’s (2018) study on green
logistics solutions. They continue the introduction with some important aspects. “In
particular, logistics is perceived as a key sector to contribute to sustainable

development meeting the future generations’ needs in terms of low greenhouse gas
emissions in a socially and economically responsible way. Green logistics involves all
attempts to reduce the ecological impact of peoples’ mobility, traffic systems and of

transport in regional and global supply chains including the reverse flow of products

and materials.” This sums this thesis up regarding the goal of investigating green
logistics and why this topic is a central part of the project.

2.1

THEORY
Definition of logistics system

Logistics is a term used to describe the flow of different materials, starting from raw

materials ending up as final products for customers. Typical stages in a logistics system
are transportation, storage and handling, which are key elements in McKinnon,

Browne and Whitening (2012) Green Logistics: “The prime, and in many cases sole,
objective has been to organize logistics in a way that maximizes profitability. The
calculation of profitability, however, has included only the economic costs that

companies directly incur. The wider environmental and social costs, traditionally
excluded from the balance sheet, have been largely ignored – until recently.”

Amodeo, Chehade and Yalaoui introduce the term of logistics as follows: “To remain
competitive, business must design, produce and distribute their products and services
while taking account of delays and increasingly restrictive quality requirements. To

succeed, they put in place new technologies and methods to continually improve their
production and distribution tools. Such a system is called a production system, or more
commonly a logistics system. These systems combine the set of processes due to which

a business produces a product or service, thus allowing it to satisfy a demand.” This is
a typical example of how close production systems and logistics system are to each
other today.

According to McKinnon et al. (2012), the importance of optimizing the logistics

system has increased during recent decades enabling companies to grow the business
and improve efficiency.

2.2

Logistics efficiency and objective

The purpose with logistics is designing a system that enables growth for the business

with a higher profit rate. Through changing different variables, a company wants to

achieve a system that fits their strategy. The variables affect different sections and it
is the overall achieved properties that need to suit the business. This is how Patrik

3

Jonsson and Stig-Arne Mattsson describe the objective of logistics and how logistics
efficiency has an impact on the business. In “Logistik” from 2016, they have picked a
couple of different sections that are important when discussing logistics efficiency and
objective. These sections will be presented below.

The first section is Customer care. Creating good relationships with customers is a
crucial factor for keeping the cash flow on a continuously good level. Good
relationships are maintained by keeping the service on a high level, which means that
the on-time delivery needs to be on point. All this indicates that the material flow needs

to be on point to have any chances keeping the deliveries on time. (Jonsson and
Mattsson, 2016)

After having customers and orders, one of the most important sections is found, costs
and profitability. This section affects the business from many points of view. A well-

designed system keeps personnel costs low and offers the opportunity to lower the
depreciation costs. However, operating costs will be higher if logistics has not been

organized well. This is a topic that will be further processed in the next chapter,
logistics and profitability. (Jonsson and Mattsson, 2016)

One of the major determinants concerning logistics systems is the amount of money

spent in order to keep the risks as low as possible. This section investigates the logistics

process from a capital-related point of view. The biggest investment usually takes

place when building stock-levels in the warehouse, investments like this have to be
compared to other ways of growing the capital. The investment also needs to be
compared to the risk of hitting a stock-out, as Harish Patil and Rajiv Divekar point out

in their article “Inventory Management Challenges For B2C” (2014). Facing a stockout can be expensive if the customers start to look for other options and this quickly

becomes more of a question regarding risk management than tied-down capital. Risk
management will be further discussed in chapter 2.7.

Another important section when thinking through the objective and efficiency of

logistics is the flexibility. Increasing the flexibility gives the company a chance to
create additional value to the customers. Typical factors in creating flexibility are

4

delivery times and delivery volumes. To make this possible, a dynamic logistics

system that responds to the customers is needed. The dynamic system has to
communicate with the available information regarding seasonal changes and other

factors affecting stock quantities. In this way, customers can be offered great service
which is more than only a great product. (Jonsson and Mattsson, 2016)

Related to flexibility and capital, the next section is lead time. To minimize the tiedup capital, lead time has a central role and flexibility is a required factor to make this

possible. There is a crucial need to optimize the lead time in order to make the cashflow
as smooth as possible. Possible attributes to be varied are order quantities and transport
modes. (Jonsson and Mattsson, 2016)

The final topic is green logistics, which has received more attention for every year and

there are many ways to influence this. The transport mode is one important point but
also packing material and packing style need to be designed according to the needs of

the company. A carefully planned packing process can shorten the lead time because
of less handling time. All the information concluded in chapter 2.2 can be found in
Logistik from 2016 by Jonsson and Mattsson.
2.3

Logistics and profitability

The long-term goal for almost all companies is to gain as high return on investment as
possible and a great mechanism to achieve this is a fully optimized logistics system.

The costs are kept as low as possible to affect positively on the return. One way to
illustrate this phenomenon is using the DuPont model shown below. Here it is

visualized how the logistics system has its impact on the return on investment. This is
how Jonsson and Mattsson (2016) have concluded the overall idea of profitability
regarding logistics systems.

On the left side, that finally affects the asset turnover, the yellow boxes all have a direct
impact on the assets. This means that the asset turnover becomes lower. On the right

side, the operating expenses affect the earnings negatively which means that the profit
margin becomes smaller. Summarized the template gives the information that through

5

a well-optimized logistics system a positive influence can be reached on many points,
which all have a direct positive impact on the return on investment. (Jonsson &
Mattsson, 2016)

Figure 1 Return on investment (Dupont analysis template, 2017)

Another aspect when discussing logistics and profitability is how and where logistics

profitability is monitored. This is a topic that has been discussed by Radulescu et al.
in their article “Increasing the company´s profitability through logistics management”.
In their conclusion they point out the importance of analyzing the supply chain as a
single chain instead of analyzing each part without connecting them to each other. This
is necessary when searching for maximized competitiveness.

Another point of view regarding competitive advantages is thinking long-term instead
of short-term. This topic has been discussed by Laari, Töyli and Ojala. Their study

indicates that one of the largest areas where long-term thinking can create more
profitability is the area of green logistics. This green thinking needs to be long-term
implemented but can attract customers willing to choose green products instead of
competitors´ non-green products. This can increase the income and, in that way,
increase the return on investment.

Peter Mesarc (2018) concludes his article regarding a company´s logistics efficiency

in a simple and straight forward way. Only focus in value-adding work and eliminate

6

non-value adding work. This can be done through optimizing or outsourcing while the
main target is accessing more space for making more money.

2.4

Perspective of logistics

There are different ways to observe a logistics system and to make decisions and
changes accordingly. It is important to have the ability to divide the system into smaller

pieces when searching for better solutions. These three approaches by Jonsson and
Mattsson (2016) are all presented below.
Strategical and tactical perspective

Here the main focus is achieving better future conditions through decision making.

These are long-term decisions that will be a part of the company’s business strategy.

Typical decisions could be outsourcing or choosing where to locate the warehouse.

Another tactical decision could be choosing the correct suppliers according to the
business strategy. (Jonsson & Mattson, 2016)

Also Grzegorz Lichocik and Adam Sadowski (2013) point out the role of strategical
perspective: “Correctly planned and fulfilled logistics tasks may result in improving

performance of a company as well as the whole supply chain. Disregarding the
importance of the designing and strategic analysis processes will surely make a supply
chain less effective. In a company aware of its importance, supply chain management

may play a key role exerting the same impact on its performance as sales, marketing
or production.”
Operative perspective

Through the operative decisions better solutions can be achieved while using the same
resources as before. To enhance the capability of systems in use they are optimized. It
is important that the flow of information works well between strategical and operative

decision makers, otherwise the business can suffer because of dissatisfied customers
who are not aware of changes that have been made. (Jonsson & Mattson, 2016)

7

Internal and external perspective

When designing a logistics system, it is important to have the ability to separate the
internal and the external perspective. The needs for each section are different but the
cooperation needs to be exceptional to gain the most from it.

Focusing on the internal perspective the needs of the production are mainly checked
and, according to that, the orders are placed. To make the return of investment as high
as possible it is needed to focus on the external perspective as well. This can be a way

to lower the price of components ordered from the suppliers. In large business units,
there is something called network perspective as well. This needs also to be taken into

account. How are the sub-suppliers affected by decisions made? When using large and
long supply chains good relationships and understanding of different working
processes are critical. (Jonsson & Mattson, 2016)
2.5

Supply chain management

2.5.1 Introduction
Management of logistics systems is all about three points: planning, organizing and
controlling. With planning good decisions are searched for to give a secure base to

build on. Then it is all about organizing the resources to make the best out of the
decisions made. To be able to continue the development of the system the last section
“controlling” is important. The need of good ways of measuring the performance is

critical to provide the opportunity to develop the existing system. Introduction to
logistics system management is a book written by Ghianpaolo Ghiani, Gilbert Laporte
and Roberto Musmanno. The introduction above is summarized with their thoughts as
basis.

In Lee Tzong-Ru’s article Powerful Supply Chain (2010), supply chain management
is pointed out to receive considerable interest because the companies do not only

expect cost reductions and reduced lead time, but also a competitive advantage when

reaching out for the dynamic market today. Tzong-Ru continues that the objective of

supply chain management is not to focus on local optimizations but to improve the
entire process.

8

According to Ghiani et al. (2013), the planning area is usually divided into a couple of

different decision-making areas: Forecasting, location, supply, storage and
distribution.

The forecasting is a procedure where the future capacity and stock level are in focus.
With a correct forecast, the production quantity and the order quantity can be adjusted
to give a better material flow. Location and supply both belong to the strategical

perspective of decisions that were mentioned in chapter 2.4. These are decisions made

according to the company’s business strategy and they are heavily influenced by the
type of business sector operated. Concerning storage and distribution, the main focus
is on the material flow. These two sections are crucial when searching for great cash
flows. (Ghiani et al. 2013)

As mentioned, next step after planning is organizing. Here the spotlight is how to
distribute the resources correctly and how to split responsibilities and tasks. Factors
affecting these decisions are operating sector, values and expectations shared by the

organization and how good the company’s use of technology is. The target is to

achieve a logistics system that can handle all types of problems without having any

major stops. Ghiani et al. continue to formulate the organization section with some
facts about how to organize the resources for reaching better decision making. For

medium-large firms the power needs to be delegated and functions must be created.
This will establish relationships of authority. (Ghiani et al. 2013)

To follow up the efficiency of a logistics system different indicators are required.

These indicators can be used to calculate the performance of the system, and usually
this is done in the last section of managing the logistics system. Generally, these are

called KPIs which stand for key performance indicators. By following the progress of
these indicators, adjustments can be made before problems occur. Typically, the KPIs

are classified into three categories: volume, effectiveness and efficiency. The quantity
of work done is measured into the category volume, the quality of the work done is
measured into the category effectiveness and the costs are measured to the third

category, efficiency. When the KPIs are defined, the creation of an easily readable

control panel needs to be done, the information needs to be near at hand and the layout
has to be nicely designed. (Ghiani et al. 2013)

9

2.5.2 Managing inventory in the supply chain
When managing the inventory’s material flow, there are some important elements to
be considered. A game plan is urgent and the awareness of how to handle different

demands is essential. A vital topic to be considered when managing inventories is

EBQ, which stands for economic batch quantity. The perfect batch size is calculated
to please the needs of the production, but it also needs to be economically optimized

to give the possibilities to grow the return on investment. The problem when

calculating the EBQ is that the demands are assumed to be stable but usually this is
not the reality. This chapter about managing inventory in the supply chain is based on

Logistics Management and Strategy written by Harrison, van Hoek and Skipworth
(2014).

The first subsection is safety stock. This is a common way of handling stock and

keeping the volume on a certain level. This safety stock will cover different surprises

that occur, such as large orders or transport delays. As shown in the figure below, there
is a safety stock level on the right and the inventory level should never land below this.
Purchase orders are placed to keep the stock quantity above this level. The safety stock
is calculated on the basis of how high the service level is chosen to be and the goal is

that the stock quantity always is higher than the safety stock. This means that the order

should be placed exactly one lead time before expecting the stock level to be lower
than the safety stock. This point where a new order is placed is called the reorder point.
(Harrison et al. 2014)

10

Figure 2 Purchasing cycles (Purchase assist technology, 2020)

When having the safety stock sorted out and calculated the next step is to calculate the
EBQ. The question at this point is how large orders can be placed without affecting

the logistics cost too much. Below there is a formula for how to calculate the EBQ

without considering any risks during the process. This formula is called the Wilson
formula. (Harrison et al. 2014)

𝐸𝐵𝑄 = √

2∗𝑧∗𝐶𝑠
𝑐∗𝐶

(1)

𝑧 = 𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡
𝑐 = 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑆𝐾𝑈 (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 𝑘𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡)
𝐶𝑠 = 𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑡, 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑙𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒
𝐶 = 𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡
When using this formula, the outcome will be a point where the annual carrying cost

crosses the annual setup cost. However, no risks have yet been calculated. Another

point to consider is the quantity of pieces that fit in one box or the maximum number
of boxes on one pallet. This means the result will not be exactly at the crossing between
those two lines, but it is a first step when deciding the ordering quantity. (Harrison et
al. 2014)

2.6

Strategies

The challenge when developing the logistics strategy is considering not only the

logistics needs, but also all restricting factors for the other sectors that are affected by

the logistical decisions. The range of a logistics system is all the way from supplier to
customer and this is the biggest challenge when forming a logistics strategy. There are

different elements needed to be dealt when creating the strategy, and to achieve a well-

working system the strategy has to deal with the problems of all elements. Kent N.

Gourdin continues his introduction of logistics strategies in Global Logistics
Management – A Competitive Advantage for the New Millennium with some key points
to think about when creating and establishing the logistics strategy. These key points
that will be presented are customer service, channels of supply and distribution,
inventories, transportation and information management.

As mentioned in chapter 2.2, the importance of customer service is high. When

forming the strategy this sector is a great place where information can be gathered.

The customers should always be placed in the center and their opinions should always
be considered when the strategy is established. The choices made should be best for

the customer when developing a long-term strategy. Without customers, there will not
be any business. (Gourdin, 2001)

12

Keeping the quantity of suppliers on an appropriate level can be the way to achieve a
logistics system to work better. In this way, each logistics channel can be optimized to
match its needs. One strategy worth considering is bolstering the suppliers to create

stronger relationships with long-term contracts. This is a strategy that gives
opportunities to all partners in the supply chain for keeping the development
continuous. (Gourdin, 2001)

When creating strong supply chains, the discussion about inventories is also worth
taking. Today, there is better understanding for the costs of having inventories

and through coordinated operations and smoother material flows the costs can be
minimized. This is a section where large amounts of money can be saved if the

inventory management is on point. This topic about controlling inventory levels is not
only about the levels at the factory but also throughout the supply chain. (Gourdin,
2001)

Moving forward to the transportation of the materials the main question is all about

what transportation mode should be used for every supplier and every delivery. The
next question is how large the shipment quantities should be. This is a question that

could belong to the management of inventories as well and is an excellent example of

how these sections affect each other. Here the EBQ calculations can be used to provide
a good starting point. The last question is who should handle the shipment? There are
considerable amounts of money that could be saved when asking for offers by different
companies. (Gourdin, 2001)

The last step in creating a strategy, according to Gourdin, 2001, is thinking about the

information flow. How should the system be planned to gather as much information
as possible? This is the main question that has to be considered when making the

strategy and focusing on information management. There are many ways information
can be gathered, and the quantity of technical tools is increasing quickly. This section
is close to customer care and through good information flow the customers can be even
more satisfied, which gives the company more business. (Gourdin, 2001)

13

To summarize the making of the logistics strategy, the understanding of the internal

material flow is clear, and the internal logistics activities should be known. Then it is
possible to move on to the whole supply chain, and as Kent Gourdin mentioned in
Global Logistics Management, the supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
With this said, a great supply chain with great capacity can be ruined if one link in the
supply chain cannot fulfil its tasks.
2.7

Risk management

Even though everything possible is done to make a process as good as possible, there
will always be certain risks. These can be risks that could be avoided by changing the

process, but then new risks will come up. In the supply chain there will be risks at

every single stage and when managing the process, the target is to minimize these
without losing efficiency. A stable process is wanted to be achieved and this means
that the whole supply chain needs to be taken into account. (Waters, 2011: 1-13)

2.7.1 Defining risk
“The fundamental of risk is that unforeseen events may happen in the future” is how

Donald Waters (2011) defines what a risk is in Supply Chain Risk Management. This
means that risks occur because of uncertainty about the future and the result will be a
damaged supply chain.

According to Waters (2011), there are two ways of dealing with risks. The most
common way is to quietly ignore the risk and continue working with the thought that

it is very rare that the damage could occur. The other way is to have a proactive policy

where plan b is already available. Using a proactive method, the effects of different

problems can be reduced. In this way, the costs of the damage will not be as large as
the costs of using a reactive policy.

Even though it is unlikely that a risk could happen, it is needed to be aware of the fact

that some of the risks will probably happen sooner or later. The awareness of the harm
is crucial for the managers who are dealing with risks. Common harms are lost
deliveries and lost customers.

14

2.7.2 Identifying risks

When identifying risks for a supply chain the first general step is dividing the
procedure into smaller operations to make it easier to notice particular risks. Below is
a list of how the dividing can be done. (Waters, 2011)
1. Define the overall supply chain process.

2. Divide this into a series of distinct, related operations.
3. Systematically consider the details of each operation.

4. Identify the risks in each operation and their main features.
5. Describe the most significant risks in a register.

Even though there is a process for identifying risks it will always be impossible to

identify every single risk that may occur. Forecasts will be made to avoid problems

but because of the unpredictable future, surprises will always appear. Critical when
talking about risk management at a firm is that the employees have been educated
properly regarding risk identification. Some may fear that revealing a risk might

suggest that things have been done incorrectly, but a risk should not be hidden because
of this. This scenario is typical when developing the management of risk identification
in companies.

Other problematic risks that exist are time-, progress- and response-dependent risks.
All of these are impossible to identify before reaching a certain period. Examples could

be decisions made by the government or actions taken due to the result of another risk.
Below is a figure describing the identification stage involved in the bigger picture of
risk management (Waters, 2011)

Figure 4 Summary of risk identification (Waters, 2011)

15

2.7.3 Risk analysis

In this chapter, a couple of different methods of analysis will be presented. Even

though these are the most used ones, it is important to be aware of the fact that these
methods can be modified and adjusted to better fit and please a business form.

Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
This is a method using a process chart as basis and ranks each risk according to a point
system. Every potential failure is ranked by three factors: Occurrence, severity and

probability of detection. These factors are scaled 1-10 and multiplied together. The

final factor will be on a scale from 1 to 1000. This is a good way to decide where to
start developing a process. Ciofu (2018) has described this analysis method in the

article FMEA – Basic Concept in Product Quality and states the width of this method
of risk analysis. It can be used for manufacturing purposes but also for logistics
processes. Ciofu (2018) has quoted Murphy’s law which is the main reason behind this
method. “Everything that can fail, will fail”. Below a simple FMEA model is
presented.

Figure 5 FMEA analysis (Moresteam, 2018)

Scenario analysis
A method that is often used in the early stages is scenario analysis and, has the what-

if approach. Waters (2011) has described this method in Supply Chain Risk
Management and mentions that this type of analysis is a brainstorming method where

experts are gathered to compare different solutions. If solution A prevents a risk that

solution B does not, solution A can surely be preferred. When considering using this
method it must be taken into account that many resources in the form of experts are

required to make it possible. Chen, Yang and Chen have used this method in their
published study Scenario Analysis and Path Selection of Low-Carbon

Transformation in China Based on a Modified IPAT Model. Here they describe this

type of analysis as a way of making assumptions and forecasts of what may happen in
the future. Most common is to use statistical data as basis, but also political and
economic development can be used.
Simulation
The basis of this method is like scenario analysis, but the outcome is a more detailed
quantitative analysis than the what-if method. Computer modeling is used to imitate

how a process would work over a longer period. Typical variables that are measured
are output and waiting time. When using this method of analysis a great benefit is
gained when different solutions can be compared without making huge modifications
in the production area. Even though simulation modeling has taken a huge step
forward, this is a method that can be really time consuming. (Waters, 2011)

2.7.4 Analyzing past events
By the point noticing that a problem has occurred an analysis has to be made to prevent

the failure from happening again. There are different methods available and below two
of the most common are listed. Both methods are described in Supply Chain Risk
Management by Waters (2011).

17

Five whys
This method is a commonly used root cause analysis and the benefit is the possibility

to connect symptoms with causes. With this method of analysis, risks that already have
occurred are analyzed to find out what the root cause is. Waters (2011) used the

following example. Here it can clearly be seen how the root cause can be found using
this method.

Figure 6 Five whys (Waters, 2011)

Cause-and-effect diagrams
Cause-and-effect diagrams are a commonly used method of analysis when making

grids of different causes that all affect the same section. This type of analysis method
is called a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram. The benefit of using this type of diagram is
gaining a wider perspective of how the process is working and how a process can be
affected by different risks and causes. The analyzed topics are always the same:

material, measurement, machine, method, environment and people. These topics can
be observed as fishbones in the diagram. Below an example is presented. (Waters,
2011)

18

Figure 7 Fishbone diagram (Lean six sigma definition, 2020)

2.7.5 Analyzing operations
The ability to minimize the risks requires awareness of how different processes work
in the reality. This creates a strong need of valuable information. There are a few

different methods and the two most common are interviews and meetings. Interviews

have the strength that the source can be chosen differently and, in that way, have a

wider perspective of the risks for a process. Meetings have the strength of developing
discussions where different solutions can be discussed. (Waters, 2011)

A mistake that often occurs during different projects is not noticing that people react

and operate in different ways. Some people are more dominant than others and because

of this many good ideas can be held aside. To counter this, the delphi-method can be
used. This is a method where questionnaires are sent out to experts in the company.
Every expert must answer the questions and an important point is that the answers are
anonymous. In this way, the fear of saying something stupid is eliminated and all ideas
can be processed. (Waters, 2011)

When analyzing the risks in a process the importance of having an up-to-date process

chart is significant. The process should be broken down into smaller activities and

19

operations giving the processor hints where to find the risks. As an example, the
sequence when moving goods from a delivery truck into stores has been divided into
the activities below.
-

Use a forklift to take pallets out of the delivery truck
Move the pallets to the receiving area

Take the goods off the pallets and remove transport packaging
Inspection of the goods

Move goods into bulk storage

Keep the materials until needed in the picking stores

There are different ways of presenting this kind of information, but a diagram is often
used. This allows the user to add information regarding different risks for each activity.

Other information that is often added to the process chart are duration and distance.
(Waters, 2011)

2.7.6 Responding to risks
Moving on to the next step after the analyzing stage is done the focus will be on how
to respond to the risks. An appropriate way to handle each risk and a proper

implementation of the response is required. There are huge variations in how to

respond to risks, but normally these can be divided into the groups listed below. This
same division has been done by Shayb (2019) in Risk Management – Identifying,
Assessing and Responding to Risks.
1. Ignore or tolerate the risk
This is a decision that must be made by the manager. When noticing a risk,
either something has to be done to avoid the consequences, or then the option

can be chosen not to do anything and simply accept the consequences. It is not

always a bad or negative decision to ignore a risk. If the analysis has been done
properly and the impacts of the risk can be accepted, it can sometimes be

20

economically profitable to ignore the risk and, for example, accept the
increased scrapping costs.

2. Reduce the probability or the consequences
If there is a high risk that something will go wrong, the managers often try to
reduce the probability of it happening. This can be an alternative when the cost

of completely removing the risk is too high, but the consequences need to be
prevented. This is a more cost-productive solution, but the risk is still there.

Instead of reducing the probability, the consequences can be minimized.
Waters (2011) uses an example of reducing the lead time from a supplier. This

means that the consequences will be reduced if there is a material shortage, but
the likelihood of it happening is still the same as before.
3. Transfer, share or deflect the risk
Move the risk from one organization to another. Sometimes another
organization has better knowledge or better possibilities to take care of

different risks and, in these cases, it needs to be considered if a transfer could
be the solution to make the supply chain stronger.
4. Make contingency plans
This is a plan done before the risk occurs to be able to react quickly enough.
This is also called a plan B. As an example, Waters uses the freight mode. If
everything goes well according to the plan, low-cost road transport can be used

but as soon as issues are faced the transportation can be changed to air freight.
5. Adapt to it
This is a passive response similar to contingency plans. The focus is to make
the process agile, which means the risks can be countered with small changes.

21

6. Oppose a change
When a major change is being made by a large company or by the government,
organizations can try to prevent the change. Through different types of
campaigns and price increases, a major change sometimes can be prevented or
modified.

7. Move to another environment
An extreme response is to completely move to another environment. This is

generally a decision made from a business perspective and can, for example,
mean that a company completely changes its business environment. Waters
(2011) uses ICI as an example. In the 1990’s, they changed their business
strategy from making bulk chemicals to more rare chemicals because of a risky
industry.

2.7.7 Logistics risk management

When dealing with risk management for logistics, there are some methods that are

widely used. These methods should always be considered when facing different
challenges regarding the supply chain. It is also important to remember that many of

the risks are directly connected to other sections, which means that some risks need
more attention because of their wider impact area. Continuing this topic, some of the
most important methods will be presented below.

In Supply Chain Risk Management (2011), there are two main ideas when focusing on
low-risk supply chains. The first step is to always have a layout of the supply chain

where parallel paths are possible. This is a method to prevent complete disasters. An
example of this type of thinking is to always have alternative transport routes.

Artsiomchyk and Zhivitskaya (2013) have pointed out the priority of this type of

design in their article “Designing Supply Chain with Robustness Analysis”. There is
no need to have parallel paths in the supply chain if there is one point where there is
only one source. One critical example could be raw material.

22

Step number two is to use a shorter supply chain. This means that the suppliers are
closer to the organization, which means the transport time is reduced.

Another option is to reduce variability. This section connects two main areas in the

organization, logistics and quality. When reducing variability Waters (2011) points out
that the quality increases. This means that a minimized variability should always be

aimed for. Regarding the logistics variables, a good example is the lead time. There is
no need to receive the materials too early because then there will not be enough stock

capacity. However, neither is it desirable to receive the materials too late, because the
on-time delivery will suffer. (Waters, 2011)

Waters (2011) describes the approach of keeping stock as simple as the higher the
stock level is, the greater will the risk be. To keep a production running continuously
it is necessary to use some sort of stock. This is the most traditional way of reducing

risks, but the trend is that today organizations focus on lean thinking and cost
reduction. With this said, a large safety stock is not always the best way to minimize
the risk because of its cost. In addition, there is always a risk that the materials on stock

will not be accurate when needed in the production. Instead of growing the stock, the
working capacity can be increased. This point is like the previous, but instead of

keeping material on stock, there is extra capacity to be used when needed. This spare
capacity can be needed when receiving large orders or when covering for unexpected
incidents.

As mentioned in chapter 2.8.6, it is a clear advantage to have a flexible organization.

When the conditions are changing, it is possible to make quick responses and still have

a process that delivers high-quality service. Examples of ways to improve agility could

be cross-trained employees and alternative suppliers. Artsiomchyk and Zhivitskaya

(2013:1) have indicated this in “Designing Supply Chain with Robustness Analysis”:

“Modern supply chains face various challenges caused by uncertainty. On one hand,
customers are more demanding than ever on service and product qualities. On the other

hand, in light of highly volatile demands, many supply chain decisions involve a high
degree of risk and channel members will suffer if the supply chain is not sufficiently
robust.”

23

Moving on to collaboration and planning, Waters (2011) specifies a couple of elements

that should always be considered. Depending on what type of business is managed, it
should always be reflected how long a suitable forecast should be. Typical factors

impacting this are how big variations are needed to be handled and how long lead times
there are to work with. These types of considerations influence the collaboration

between suppliers and can decrease risks. The key is to share as much information as
possible to improve the visibility for both partners.

To reduce the risk, it is often easier when there is a legal contract saying who is
responsible for what part. This increases the liability for both partners and the
information flow can have a boost due to the higher level of responsibility.

2.8

Green logistics

In Green Logistics (2012:3), McKinnon, Browne and Whiteing describe the major
outlook of logistics over the past 10-15 years as follows: “The prime objective has

been to organize logistics in a way that maximizes the profitability”. This is an outlook

changing and turning into an environmentally friendlier one, investing in sustainability
and branding.

Another one sharing same information is Ping. In her article “Strategy of Green
Logistics and Sustainable Development” (2009:1), she is pointing out the importance

of coordinating the relationship between the logistics and the environment: “The
purpose of green logistics is to realize economic benefits of certain subject, and at the
same time, to look after saving resources, protecting environment especially. The aim

has both economic and social characteristics.” This is one way to achieve a more
reasonable logistics through sustainable development.

The constant growth of freight transport has made its impact and there is a crucial need

of planning what transport mode should be used for each supply chain. McKinnon

24

(2012) has identified that the domestic freight transport in the UK has risen by 69
percent from 1969 to 2010. This is an enormous increase that needs to be optimized.

From picture 3, it can be noted that the transport sector is enormous when investigating

the impact on the environment. This picture is from EU Transport in Figures,
Statistical Pocketbook (2017) and tells how important this topic is. The sector has risen
about 50% in the last 25 years.

Figure 8 EU transport in figures (Statistical pocketbook, 2017)

2.8.1 Strategic perspective of green logistics
When discussing the strategical perspective of green logistic it is most often connected

with the design of the network. According to McKinnon (2012), there are two typical

strategies when trying to reduce the environmental impact. The first one, which is the
more traditional one, is to develop the existing design as a straight-lined network.

25

Evaluations are made for each object and actions are made according to that. The
second strategy is to design an extended supply chain. This means that it is a closedloop supply chain where reversed logistics can be used. Typical subjects when
designing these kinds of networks are recycling and using environmentally friendlier
packing methods.

Figure 9 Extended supply chain (Beamon, 1999)

Even though there are a few different aspects when designing an environmentally
friendly logistics system, there are some factors that always need to be included.

Energy consumption, emissions and waste are factors that need to be reduced.

However, recycling and reusing need to be increased. Optimizing all these factors will
help to achieve a greener supply chain. (McKinnon, 2012)

Another point when discussing the strategy of green logistics is the sustainability. In

the article The Interrelation between Sustainability and Green Logistics by Nagham

El-Berishy, Ingrid Rügge and Bernd Scholz-Reiter (2013:1), a sentence from Hans
Carl von Carlowitz has been quoted: “Do not fell more trees than could grow back.”

26

2.8.2 Greener transport modes
The most interesting point when comparing the environmental effects of different

transport modes is the CO2 emission. In this chapter, different freight modes will be

explained and compared to each other. To summarize the chapter a graph with the CO2
emissions of the most common freight modes will be presented.
Road freight
When comparing different road freight options to each other the most critical element
is the size of the vehicle. In this chapter, heavy goods vehicles and vans will be

separated to make it clearer. This is also the way Alan McKinnon has made his
comparison in his article CO2 Emissions from Freight Transport in the UK (2007).

In this article, McKinnon has stated some key facts needed to be mentioned. The first
point is that road freight has had a stable increase from year to year, but at the same

time, there have been reductions in empty running and improvements in fuel
efficiency.

According to the calculations McKinnon has used in his article, the result is that vans

have had the CO2 emissions of 360 gram/tonne-km compared to heavy goods vehicles
138 grams/tonne-km.
Rail freight
When measuring CO2 emissions from rail freight there is one aspect that needs to be

estimated, the ratio of diesel rail freight compared to electric rail freight. According to
Professor Alan McKinnon (2007), 90% of tonne-kms in the UK are hauled by diesel

locomotives. McKinnon has also mentioned some ratios of CO2 suggested by IFEU

(2005) for European rail freight. According to this comparison, electric rail freight has
18 grams/tonne-km while diesel rail freight has 35 grams/tonne-km.

Another study undertaken by the University of Leuven has reached the CO 2 result of
33 grams/tonne-km. This summarizes that both McKinnon’s estimation and IFEU
calculations are aligned.

27

Air freight
Air Freight is the smallest sector when looking at total kg transported but when looking

at CO2 emissions, this sector is number one. McKinnon (2007) has listed a couple of
studies where estimations have been made for CO 2 emissions and the results are quite
similar to each other. For short airfreight services (distance 425 – 500km), the results

are 1420, 1580 and 1925 grams/tonne-km. For international air cargo services, where

we have longer distances, the results have been 637, 800, 800 and 867 grams/tonnekm.

Waterborne transport
The last freight method to be compared is shipping. This method can also be divided
into smaller sectors depending on the size of the ship.

Small vessels produce about 60 grams CO2 per tonne-km, while the movement of a

slightly bigger ship generates around 30-40 grams of CO2 per tonne-km. However,
when discussing large bulk carriers good results can be reached, 7 grams/tonne-km.

It needs to be added that the environment is also affecting the emissions. Usually, it is
more efficient to transport materials through inland waterways where the conditions
are not as tough as at coastal shipping.
Comparison
Below a comparison from a study done by Meiler-Maerks is presented. This study was

conducted in 2014 which is one reason why some of the values differ from those
presented by McKinnon. As mentioned, there has been much development for
decreasing the emissions for different motorized vehicles and this can clearly be
noticed here.

One important point is that even though there have been improvements for CO2
emissions for different vehicle types, we have to remember that all motorized vehicles
cannot be renewed at once.

28

Figure 10 Comparison of CO2 emissions (Meiler-Maersk, 2014)

2.8.3 Reverse logistics
The most common way of improving the supply chain is to control the flow from

supplier to customer but, in this chapter, the supply chain will be extended into a loop

including reverse logistics. This is an alternative that provides the ability to manage
the waste.

In Green Logistics (2012:255), McKinnon describes the process of reverse logistics as
follows: “Reverse logistics has been defined as the process of planning, implementing

and controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory,
finished goods, and related information from the point of consumption to the point of

origin, for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal”. McKinnon also
indicates that products do not necessarily need to be returned to the original point at

the supply chain; there is also the possibility to return materials or waste to a point that
in general can increase the sustainability of the supply chain.

Regarding reverse logistics the network can be identified as four different structures.
The first network is integrated outbound and returns network. This means that returns
are back hauled with same vehicles that provide the deliveries from the suppliers. A

network working this way is best suited for supply chains where the volumes and the
delivery frequency are high.

The second network type is the non-integrated outbound and returns network. This

29

structure has a separate process for the returns and the provider is typically a third
party. The typical environment where this network works well is where the return
volume is low.

Third party returns management is the next network type to be described. This way of
working can be compared to outsourcing. Practically, another company is paid to take
care of the return’s management. The third party takes care of required technologies,
refurbishments and disposition programs.

The last type is return to suppliers. Here materials are exchanged back to the suppliers

for credit. This is an easy process to handle, but the transportation costs may be
expensive. (McKinnon, 2012)

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Current logistics system

To be able to analyze different stages and sections of a process it is crucial to have an

accurate understanding of how the system in use is working and how different sections
and stages are cooperating with each other. A proper visualization is needed to get

going with the project and this is the reason why a process chart was created to support
both the qualitative and the quantitative analyses.

With this process chart as basis, the different working phases could be divided into

sections that are affected similarly by different decisions. For example, both the goods
reception and the forklift drivers are affected if the lot sizes are changed, as smaller lot
sizes give higher inventory turnover but affect the workload for both working units.

Continuing with analyses of the current logistics system the process map is urgent and
this is the ground for the data collecting. Every step must be evaluated and the impacts
from these steps are plotted and mapped according to importance. This will be the

starting point for the project and according to this process map, the optimization will
be done. The process map is presented below as figure 11.

The next step is to find proper data that support the project and the main source for

this will be the ERP system. Here data can be found for all departments mentioned in
the process map. This will be further described in chapters 3.2 and 3.3.

31

Figure 11 Process chart of current logistics system

3.2

Qualitative analysis

When a proper logistics model is mapped and ready to be evaluated, it is important to
have a priority list showing in which order the analysis should be done. To overcome
this problem the qualitative analysis called FMEA will be used. This method is
described in chapter 2.7.3 and is suitable for this project as the analyzing stage has just

started, which means there is a critical need of finding information about where and
how the optimization should start and proceed. As mentioned in chapter 2.7.3, the

outcome of the FMEA analysis method will be a table which puts the risks in priority
and gives the project manager hints where development of the current process can most
easily be done. The complete FMEA will be presented in chapter 4, Results. One detail

regarding this qualitative analysis method is that the result of the current FMEA can
always be re-evaluated and used later to optimize the processes even further.

The second qualitative analysis method used in this thesis is the five whys approach.

As mentioned in the theory chapter, this is a root-cause analysis method and the idea
when using it is to provide more depth to understanding why different problems occur
and what the risks of these problems are.

The third and last analysis model used for this freight optimization project is the

fishbone model. The purpose of this qualitative analysis method is the same as for fivewhys, namely providing depth to understanding why something has happened.

Important to notice is that with the fishbone method it is always checked if it somehow

could relate to an area that was not discovered during the five-whys analysis. Common
for these two root-cause analyses is that the check-ups were held in a group of
specialists to gain influences from different departments. Represented departments

were logistics, quality, maintenance and manufacturing. These check-ups are held

every week to process all notifications presented by both customers and internal
people. The result of these qualitative analyses is presented in chapter 4, results.

33

3.3

Quantitative data analysis

In this chapter, the focus is to collect proper data that can be the ground for the business
case and evaluating how the current process is working. When we have this data
available, we can easily compare the outcome of this thesis with the old process.

Basically, the qualitative analysis is used to get going with the quantitative analysis
that in turn is used to create the business case.

When searching for ideas of how to optimize the logistics model the process map and
the FMEA analysis were used as basis. Through these analyses, the collecting of data

could start for every single step of the processes according to the process map. First, a
short table was made with the most crucial points where data was needed for making
further decisions. This table is presented below.

When the strategy for quantitative data collecting was clear, the first step was to sort
low-running materials away from the analyses. In appendix 4, we can clearly see that
the variations are large, and this table is the first step towards our quantitative analyses.

After choosing which materials to further analyze, the quantitative evaluation could
continue according to table 1 presented above. All these data were summarized into a
table that was the center for the implementation that will be presented in chapter 4,
Results. The summarized data are presented as appendix 5, Quantitative data 2.

34

3.4

Business case

To be able to continue with the thesis, a business case had to be created. A positive

business case shows the involved persons that this project is worth carrying out and

fulfilling. Without a proper business case, no resources can be assigned for the project,
which means the project will not proceed.

The starting point of the business case is evaluating the costs and environmental effects
of the current logistics system that was processed in chapter 3.1. This process map is

connected with the data that were collected when making the quantitative analysis. At

this stage, the business case is kept as simple as possible to give a clear overall picture
of the possibilities for the project. Invoices were collected from year 2017 and these
prices were used as the reference point for all calculations related to savings.

The next step of the business case is presenting different ideas of how to improve the
process. An estimation of the costs is added, and these costs are compared to the
current costs that we have analyzed in chapter 3.3. An important point is to define in

what order the implementation could be done and the most common way is to start
with the point that has the biggest impact compared to the time used for

implementation. The goal is to achieve lower costs with a more environmental
logistics approach, which means this chapter is crucial.

The last point for the business case is creating a time schedule. Depending on what

resources are available, a rough time schedule needs to be plotted to give a hint when
and how the implementation could take place.

When all these steps and stages are done, the business case can be stated as finished.
The sequences for how the project will continue is clear and the benefits of the project

is pointed out once more, which is the most important point with the business case.
This is needed to have the project accepted by the management and, in this way, earn
the investments needed for continuing the project.

35

3.5

Environmental comparison

One of the targets with the thesis was to achieve a more environmentally friendly

process and as the new process is still at the planning stage, there are possibilities to
influence the process with all kinds of environmentally friendly methods. To be able
to compare the old process with the new process, the available data regarding the

routes for material shipped must be analyzed. According to these data, calculations can

be done to show the result as CO2 per kilogram shipped material. This is the most
relevant way to compare the two processes, because there can be large variations in

shipping weight per month. When making calculations for the new method, the same
measurement unit is needed, i.e. CO2 per kilogram shipped material.

When having the result from both processes a proper comparison can be done to check
how well we have optimized the new process compared to the old one. Some further
improvements will also be mentioned.
3.6

Implementation of new logistics process

Taking all the analyses into calculation, a new process will be presented and an
implementation plan needs to be done. Important is that all partners involved and

affected by this new process are aware of the changes. The information needs to be

shared to everyone to make the change as quick as possible. Another factor to be
considered is the time required before being able to use the new process. Risk
management is crucial, which means that stock levels and other possible safety levels

need to be at the highest possible point. When all possible stages are considered, the
implementation date will be stated and the control part can start.

3.7

Control plan

When it has been decided how the implementation will be done, plans for how the
logistics process will be controlled and optimized in the future also need to be created.
All analyses are used to make the control plan as wide as possible, covering all possible
risks. The complete control plan will be presented in next chapter, Results.

4.1

RESULTS
Result of analysis

Our first method of analysis, FMEA, was chosen to provide information about where
to start and which phases were the most critical ones. The complete FMEA is found as

an attachment and the result of this analysis will be described below. As mentioned in
chapter three, the whole process is analyzed which means all different phases are

evaluated in order to find all potential failures. Some of the process stages are close to
each other and those stages were combined to make the result clearer.

The first point of the logistics process, beside raw-material suppliers, is the supplier

delivering materials to the external warehouse or straight to the factory. At this point,
there were two common issues regarding the logistics process, wrong packing method

and wrongly marked materials. These issues are close to each other, and possibly even
overlap each other, but still there was a need to keep them as two failure modes because

of the big difference in severity. This difference in severity is due to different factors
which result in different failures.

Phase two, external warehouse, and phase three, receiving, have been combined in this
analysis due to their similar working methods. These two points are the process phases

where most potential failures are faced, but all of them usually have the same cause,
material shortage. Two of the potential failure modes are associated with how the

reception of the goods is done. The goods receipt process is a phase where mistakes

can easily be made and listed in the analysis there are GR wrongly done and GR done
too late. These two can sometimes be overlapped but are kept as single issues because
the steps where the failure happens are at different stages of the process. The result is

similar to a total point difference of 36. Another failure mode worth mentioning is
material wrongly guided. This means there is a lack of information and unnecessary
movement of the materials to the wrong warehouse.

The next point at the logistics process evaluated is the warehouse and the picking area
called supermarket. Here some ergonomic difficulties and complications at the picking

37

process are faced. These two phases are classified as individual failure modes because

of the huge difference in severity. Ergonomic work is a topic needed to take seriously
and because of that this has one of the highest severities of all failure modes in the
FMEA.

The last point in the FMEA analysis concerns supply chain management, more

specifically how orders are placed to the suppliers. There has been a huge lack of
reaching a smooth material flow for some of the components delivered by some
suppliers. The reason for this is that the ERP system has been unable to use the forecast
in an efficient way.

Our second analysis method that will be presented is 5-whys. In this thesis, 5-whys
analyses are made for two incidents connected to logistics even though they have
different approaches. Both are found as attachment.

The first analysis is called incorrect delivery of fuse links and is a root-cause analysis
of why 35% of incorrect deliveries are connected to fuse links. Turning this around

the same analysis can be used to improve the deliveries from the suppliers to the
warehouse, which is important when planning a new logistics process.

The next 5-whys analysis presented is a case where a customer received the wrong
type of switch, as the customer had ordered a type D switch but received a type B
switch. When doing the 5-whys analysis, it was detected that the root cause for this
faulty delivery was an error in the warehouse management process. Even though the

problem was a faulty delivery, this method of analysis is a good option when looking

for detailed root cause information. The complete 5-whys analysis can be found in the
appendices.

The last qualitative method of analysis used for this thesis is the fishbone diagram.
According to the FMEA analysis, the most common problem is that the factory will

have a material shortage because of a delay of some sort. The fishbone analysis
presented below will cover the risks for a delay caused by the transportation.

38

According to chapter 2.7.4, the fishbone diagram should contain the following bones:

Machines, methods, people, materials, environment and measurements. In this case,
the measurements were not relevant and, thus, not considered. Under the bone affected

by people “harsh handling during transportation” can be found. As comments we have
terminals and forwarder, both of these are typical places where this kind of problem

has been observed. Another bone affected by the forwarder is “late loading”, because
this typically happens because of the forwarder or the supplier.

For this case the machine in use is the truck and, therefore, this bone will be “truck
breakdown”. Typically, reasons are bad maintenance or an old vehicle.

Regarding the environment, the risk is that there will be some problems because of a

traffic congestion and generally the only option is to choose another route. Important
when choosing the route is to make the plan according to green logistics. This will

make the process environmentally friendlier and more economical when the diesel

consumption decreases. Another subheading where we can involve green logistics is
the materials. The recycling needs to be outlined and another factor is preparing
packing instructions for the suppliers.

Figure 12 Fishbone diagram of a late delivery

With these qualitative analyses as ground the quantitative analyses could start and the

39

collection of information could begin. In the appendices, there are two tables with
quantitative data where all sharable information is presented.

The first table is a simple quantitative analysis of how many pieces the factory is using
of high-running materials from two of our biggest suppliers located close to each other.
This is a first step when aiming for a smaller scope.

In the second table, the most high-running materials have been analyzed even further.

The consumption at the final factory is analyzed on a weekly level and packing

methods are added and compared to give hints of how big volume and mass is

consumed per week. As a final step, it is investigated how big the load 80% would be.
This would be a weekly baseload to cover the mass production. As a result, we have a
weekly load of different materials added with the total mass and volume.

4.2

New logistics model

When all aspects of the analyzes were summarized decisions had to be made. Through

discussions with the P&L manager, the decision was made to start a milk run process.
This process contained all the factors improving the stability of the supply chain.

This new logistics model is a complete one-way route from supplier to factory

including two loading points. This means there will not be any loadings at terminals

causing damage to the materials. Another aspect worth mentioning is that this shortens
the transport lead time with about two days per route.

The milk run deliveries are made once a week, always the same materials and always

the same quantity. The quantity is based on the average consumption calculated in the
quantitative analysis. In the beginning, 80% of the total consumption would be
included to the milk run. Peak consumptions will all be handled by regular

transportations. This is also a great way to achieve cost savings if having the possibility
to maximize the load. A higher load gives better price per kilogram, which means
better profitability.

40

4.3

Savings

When calculating the savings, the unit is price per kilogram. This is the most evenhanded way to compare transportation costs when the volume is shifting from one year

to another. Figure 13 below shows the result of our price comparison per month. For
different reasons, the decision was made to present the price development as
percentage of the original price 2017.

It can be noted that the blue line (minimum price) is steady at 76%, which is the
maximum amount of savings that can be reached using this new process. To achieve
76% savings, it requires that the truck is loaded to its maximum weight capacity.

When starting the process, savings slightly under 50% were achieved. The graph is
then aiming towards the minimum price which is our target. During the year, the saving

percentage has steadily increased except for two months, during which some quality
issues were faced at the supplier.

Supply chain

When implementing the new logistics model, the supply chain was updated with some
new values for critical factors. These factors all have an impact on how to determine
the most common preferences.

Number one where everything starts is the lead time. With the old transport model, the
transport lead time was 7-9 days. With the new transport method, the transport lead
time has been shortened to 5-7 days. This means that the quickest possible transport

time earlier is the slowest possible with the new model. On average, the lead time has
been shortened by two days.

Another aspect that is optimized with the new model is the material flow. According

to the analyses, there were huge variations in quantities received per week. This variety
matters when setting the safety stock level. With a shorter transport time, optimized

material flow and the information of knowing that there is always one shipment
incoming, the stock level could be decreased by 25%. When decreasing the stock level

and still managing to deliver on time the inventory turnover increases, which was one
of the aims of this project.

Regarding the material flow, steps towards a more even flow can also be seen. In the
comparison shown below, a blue line represents the new process and a red line

represents the old process. It can clearly be noted that there is an increase of the weekly
deliveries of this material to have it stabilized. There are still peaks when covering
bigger orders and there is still room for optimizing the process even further. For
example, from week 4 to week 11 there were no deliveries at all which resulted in a
peak at week 12. This is a problem which needs to be adjusted.

Environment

When setting the frames for this thesis, it was clear that this project is not all about

savings; there was a need to know how good the transportation methods are

environmentally. Below are the calculations for the CO2 emissions of the new logistics
process. For the calculations, the emission factors in chapter 2.8.2. have been used.

It can clearly be seen that most of the route is transported by truck on the road; actually,
this is 97.5% of the total route. Even though the road transport covers 97.5% of the

total transport it covers 99.4% of the CO2 emissions. This is because road transport
has higher emissions than transport on the water.

These calculations have also been compared to an emission report done by the

transport company. According to their calculations, the tank-to-wheel emission is

4 928kg. This means that their transport vehicles are more environmentally friendly
than average vehicles. Another factor that affects this result is that, with this new
process, the load is full from start to finish, which has a positive effect on the
environmental impact.

Another comparison done is the new process by road transport compared to express

delivery by air. The table below shows the calculations of the emissions of an express
delivery of the same weight as in the new process.

This means that the express delivery has CO2 emissions multiplied by 4.5. The total

length of this express route is 316km longer than the normal transportation route due
to a more inefficient flight route.

4.6

Control plan

The last step of this project was to make a control plan. Through this the optimizing

can be done and the control plan needed to be as wide as possible to gain a positive

development in the near future. The complete control plan can be found in the
appendices and below the different points will be discussed.

44

The first point is savings and will be followed-up internally. As mentioned earlier, the
calculations will be done with the unit price per kilogram. These will be calculated

every month and documentation is saved under the project in OPEX, which is an
internal program used for documentation.

The next step is to re-evaluate the FMEA that has been done. Every sixth month this

will be done, and the re-evaluated report will be saved in the internal logistics folder.
This is one of the most important points of the process control plan, because it affects
how safe the working site is.

Point three and four are both connected to the supply chain, but these are divided into

two different points because two different follow-ups are wanted, one internal and one
together with the supplier. Both reports are updated once a month.

The last point in the process control plan is reliability. This will give information of
how well the new logistics system is working and can be compared to the old process

as well. To gain a more objective view of this follow-up the decision was made to

update this report once a quarter. This will provide more information and can also be
compared more easily to last year’s seasonal differences.

45

5 DISCUSSION
When defining the frame for the thesis it was clear that improvements were needed

for the inbound freight concerning almost all aspects. A better process, with a more
environmentally friendly approach was aimed for and through different methods of
analysis the new process was defined.

The most time-consuming part of this project was finding all information needed for
the analysis methods chosen. Especially mapping the process at that point was time

consuming and this was critical for being able to start the analyses. The following point
when having the process mapped was searching for ways of receiving usable data from
the ERP-system telling how good the process is working and what stages need most

improvements. This was an interesting stage of the project when recognizing that the
project is moving closer to finding solutions for the new way of working.

When making the FMEA analysis it was important to be objective and try to compare

the different valuations to each other. This is crucial when making the FMEA;

otherwise the ranking system is unusable. Being fair and even-handed was the most
difficult part for this method. It is also suitable to discuss different scenarios with

people who have been involved in similar projects earlier. Discussing with

experienced people was also the way to analyze the result of the 5-whys method. This
helped to understand the working method and how not to end up into a closed loop

when using this method of analysis. This problem is the most common mistake people
do when searching for the root cause through the 5-whys method.

Calculating emissions from different transport options and comparing these to each

other is a good way of bench marking how good the transport process is and how big
improvements can be achieved using other options.

The result of the calculations shows that if there are no critical demands, there is no
need for express deliveries. This means the environmental impact is minimal and the

process can be considered environmentally friendly. Next step in the future is to
develop the process so that reusable packing materials are used on a larger scale, which
could also involve return loads to the suppliers. Another thing that could be considered

46

as an environmentally friendly step forward is the improvement of the supply chain. It

cannot be stated at this point that it has affected the scrapping in a positive way yet but

when having a supply chain using smaller stock quantities than before, it should result

in smaller amounts of scrapped materials. Currently, as much materials as possible are
recycled but, unfortunately, there are always some materials that cannot be recycled
and thus affect the environment in a negative way.

When creating a control plan it was important to keep the tasks on a level that can be
operated, even if there are new inexperienced people at new positions. The idea behind

the tasks were to give the controller a hint where to look for further improvements and

what needs to be pointed out is that the most important point with the control plan was

that it does not lock the process in some way in the future. The flexibility is important,
and this is considered when creating the control plan.

47

6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the beginning of the thesis project, there was a need for a better process with a

more environmentally friendly approach. This made it slightly difficult not to expand
the frame of the thesis. However, this leaves plenty of improvements for the future
and numerous possibilities for future supply chains.

One of the most interesting parts that was not involved in this particular process was
the extended logistics chain, but this will be added in the near future and this will be

a major point when comparing how environmentally friendly the process is. Making
the transport process into a loop does not only minimize the amount of waste, it can
also improve the ergonomics. The improvement of ergonomics is a hot topic at the
moment, this makes the project improvements even more meaningful.

Another interesting aspect of this new process is that it could be implemented to any
transport route regardless the transport mode. The only criterion is that we have

enough volume to find a pattern of deliveries. For the future, I would not be surprised
if the process were implemented for Asia – Europe transports. One reason is that the
transport price is high, and another reason is that the current process is not green at
all. We need to improve our business in a sustainable way without causing

unnecessary emissions. These emissions observed as unnecessary can surely be
avoided with a well-planned process.

Another aspect that has not been included in this thesis is the follow-up of the quality
for material delivered. One of the reasons why the milk-run process was chosen was
the quality aspect and this could be documented. The loading and reloading of

materials have heavily decreased and this should result in better quality and smaller
economic losses.

Regarding the methods of analysis, there is one area which needs to be further
investigated. The FMEA presented is made for the old process and now when we have

a new process we not only need to update the values for different points, but we also
need to investigate if we have found new phases in our process where potential failures

can be found. This needs to be done during the control phase to secure the safe
environment for involved persons.

48

As we can see above, there are many areas that can be developed even further. This is
an important part of the project and also the reason why the control plan was made. In
today’s business environment, people more often change functions and this will give
everyone involved a better overview of what areas need to be followed up.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Optimering av frakt
Inledning
Den globalt växande automatiseringen har gjort det viktigt för företag att effektivisera

materialflöden för att kunna uppnå konkurrenskraft gentemot andra företag. Mängden

importerade material mellan länder ökar ständigt och optimeringen av frakter blir allt
viktigare när man fokuserar på en högkvalitativ leveranskedja.

Logistikens betydelse har blivit allt mer uppmärksammad med otaliga studier kring
ämnet. Studier visar att upp till 64 % av logistiska kostnader kommer direkt från
transportkostnader och det är en av de främsta orsakerna till att ämnet intresserar
företag. En annan aspekt är den ständigt växande kunskapen om miljötänk och så
kallad grön logistik. Dessa kombinerat gör att ämnet intresserar många.

Ovannämnda faktorer har även uppmärksammats vid ABB Oy, Smart Power, och
därför togs beslutet att undersöka möjligheterna att utveckla de logistiska processerna.

Smart Power är en högautomatiserad fabrik som tillverkar strömbrytare för olika
behov. Fabriken är belägen i Vasa men produkterna säljs globalt. De senaste åren har

produktionen effektiverats vilket har skapat ett behov för en effektivare logistisk
process.

Avhandlingen avgränsades till inkommande logistik med fokus på en högkvalitativ

leverantörskedja. Målet var att skapa en effektiverad men samtidigt tillförlitlig process
för inkommande material. Grön logistik låg i fokus för att skapa ett hållbart koncept.

Material och metoder
Det första steget för projektet var att få en helhetsbild av utgångsläget. Viktigt var att
ha förståelse av hur olika avdelningar samarbetar och hur olika beslut påverkar

processen. En visualisering var nödvändig för att komma vidare med projektet, och

50

därför var steg 1 att sammanställa ett schema för processen. Med visualiseringen av
processen kunde analyserna börja. Först utfördes de kvalitativa analyserna och därefter
de kvantitativa.

Inledningsvis gjordes en feleffektsanalys, förkortat FMEA. Den här metoden är en
ypperlig startpunkt för resultatet ger en rangordning där de mest kritiska bristerna
finns. Den andra analysmetoden var five-whys-metoden. Här närmar man sig
problemen från andra hållet. Metoden är nämligen en rotfelsanalys vilket betyder att

något ska ha gått snett innan man kan använda sig av metoden. Den tredje kvalitativa
analysmetoden var fishbone-metoden, även kallad Ishikawa. Här simulerar man vad
som kan hända i en viss del av processen, till exempel vid transporten.

De kvalitativa analyserna kunde därefter starta med ovannämnda analyser och

processchemat som grund. Utifrån visualiseringen av processen valdes ett antal
punkter där kvantitativa data skulle samlas in och analyseras. Detta sammanställdes i
två separata tabeller som gav en referenspunkt för hur bra processen fungerat och var
brister fanns.

Med resultatet från analyserna planerades den nya processen och därefter gjordes de

miljömässiga kalkylerna. Målet var att veta hur effektiva transportmetoderna är och
jämföra olika alternativ. Här beräknades två olika rutter som jämfördes sinsemellan.

Till sist gjordes en kontrollplan för att underlätta fortsatta optimeringar. Målsättningen
med kontrollplanen var att omfatta så stor del av processen som möjligt för att kunna
eliminera eller minimera framtida risker.

Resultat och diskussion
När alla analyser gjorts och resultatet från dem sammanställts kunde den nya processen
planeras. Beslutet var att starta en så kallad mjölkrunda. Det här var ett alternativ som

ansågs vara bästa möjliga med tanke på företagets ändamål. Den här processen innebär
en veckovis transport som innehåller samma mängder material varje vecka. De främsta

positiva aspekterna var förbättrad lönsamhet, bättre kvalitet och mindre svinn.
Dessutom kunde ledtiden för transporten förkortas från ett medeltal på åtta dagar till

51

ett medeltal på sex dagar.
När lönsamheten beräknades och priserna jämfördes användes enheten €/kg för att
kunna jämföra olika tidsperioder. De maximala inbesparingarna kalkylerade enligt

offerter var 76 % av transportkostnader. Den första månaden efter implementeringen
var inbesparingen knappa 50 % och efter 10 månader knappa 70 %.

En annan aspekt som analyserades var leverantörskedjans funktionalitet. Ett jämnare

materialflöde eftersträvades och bättre optimerat för den interna logistiken. Även på
denna punkt påvisar studien förbättringar. Här jämfördes veckovisa mottagna
kvantiteter och målsättningen var att eliminera topp- och bottenvärden. Stora framsteg
gjordes men fortsatta förbättringar kan göras.

på

transportprocesserna som visade hur viktigt det är att försöka optimera
vägtransporterna för att undvika flygtransporter. För att säkerställa att beräkningarna
var korrekta jämfördes de med transportbolagets beräkningar.

Efter avslutat arbete kan man konstatera att målsättningen uppfylldes. Det finns rum
för förbättringar och framförallt kan processen implementeras hos flera leverantörer.

Ämnet är väldigt intressant med tanke på framtida utsläppsrestriktioner och satsningen
på miljövänliga alternativ ständigt ökar. Man kan konstatera att den logistiska
effektiveringen spelar en meningsfull roll i utvecklingen av produktionskedjorna hos
stora företag.
