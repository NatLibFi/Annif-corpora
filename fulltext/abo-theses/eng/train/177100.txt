ABSTRACT
The use of natural gas (NG) is increasing worldwide due to its clean energy source and
the fact that it offers a reduction of emissions related to global warming compared to
other fossil fuels. It can be stored and transported as liquified natural gas (LNG) at a
temperature of -162°C and pressure above 1 atm due to safety and economic reasons.
The demand for LNG import has increased with the energy demand.
This has resulted in LNG receiving terminals being built onshore to import LNG. The
LNG is stored in storage tanks, and it is vaporized through a regasification process
before it is supplied to the end-user. After vaporization, it is delivered by pipelines to
the end-users. However, not all end-users can be reached by a pipeline. This is where
the use of an LNG satellite terminal comes into place. An LNG satellite terminal is a
small-scale LNG receiving terminal, which includes all necessary processes and
equipment to receive, store and vaporize LNG to end-users. The delivery of LNG
arrives by mobile transport equipment.
The monitoring and the control of LNG processes in a safe manner are the most
important parts of any LNG facility. Therefore, the control system needs to be reliable
and designed accordingly, all the way from the control room to the measuring
instrument of the process. Precise data needs to be delivered from the measuring
instrument.
The objectives of this thesis are to a) review the instrumentation used for a standard
pressurized LNG satellite terminal, b) analyze the need for the instrumentation c) find
new methods and instruments that meet the requirements of the different measurement
points in the systems, d) review control and instrument communication and connection
from a reliability, safety and economical point of view, and lastly e) to finalize the
instrumentation specifications according to the findings.
This thesis contains a technology overview of current and new monitoring methods
for cryogenic conditions. These methods have been established and reviewed as
suitable for the monitoring of LNG processes. Guidelines for design in the form of
international standards have also been found and are included to help with selection,
installation and recommendations for the design of the LNG processes. The result of
this thesis is meant to help process design engineers to understand the background and
the thought process for establishing the monitoring instrumentation in a pressurized
and cryogenic process.

ABSTRAKT
Användning av naturgas har ökat runtom i världen på grund av att energikällan är ren
och påfrestningen på miljön mindre jämfört med andra fossila bränslen. Transport och
förvaring sker som vätska kallad flytande naturgas (LNG). Detta sker vid en
temperatur på -162 °C och tryck över 1 atm på grund av säkerhet och av ekonomiska
orsaker. Efterfrågan på LNG-import har ökat med energibehovet.
Resultatet är ett ökande antal LNG-mottagningsterminaler på land för import av LNG.
LNG förvaras i lagringstankar och innan leverans till slutanvändaren förångas den till
naturgas i en återförgasningsanläggning. Efter förångningen levereras naturgasen till
slutanvändaren via rörledningar. Detta är dock inte möjligt för alla slutanvändare på
grund av geografiska hinder. Då kan man istället bygga en LNG-satellitterminal. En
satellitterminal är en mindre version av en mottagningsterminal som innehåller alla
nödvändiga processer och anläggningar för att ta emot, lagra, förånga LNG och
leverera naturgas till slutanvändaren. LNG fraktas med tankbilar till satellitterminalen.
Det viktigaste med övervakning och kontroll av LNG-processer är att det utförs säkert
och gäller för alla LNG-anläggningar. Därför måste styrsystemet vara tillförlitligt och
designat så att detta gäller hela vägen från processens mätpunkt till kontrollrummet.
Exakta data måste levereras från mätinstrumentet och ju mer tillgänglig information,
desto bättre.
Syftet med denna avhandling är att granska mätinstrument som används i en standard
LNG-satellitterminal, analysera behovet av mätinstrument och hitta nya mätmetoder
eller instrument som uppfyller kraven på de olika mätpunkterna. Därtill undersöks
kontrollsystemets och mätinstrumentets kommunikation och anslutning för att bedöma
deras tillförlitlighet och säkerhet samt för att överväga ekonomiska perspektiv.
Slutligen presenteras instrumentspecifikationerna utgående från erhållna resultat.
Avhandlingen innehåller en teknisk översikt över nuvarande och nya
övervakningsmetoder för kryoteknik. Metoderna har granskats om de är lämpliga för
övervakning. Internationella riktlinjer har också inkluderats för att hjälpa till med valet
av mätinstrument och hur de installeras samt rekommendationer för design av LNGprocesser. Resultaten i avhandlingen ökar förståelsen av processen att designa
övervakningen och kontrollsystemet i en LNG-anläggning.

INTRODUCTION

Natural gas (NG) is found in large quantities and is the cleanest fossil fuel sustainable

for combating the concern of global warming (Reddy et al., 2019). Most regions of the
world use NG as a clean energy source. It can be stored and transported as liquefied

natural gas (LNG) at a temperature of −162°C and pressurized above 1 atm for
financial and safety considerations (Hong et al., 2019). The increase of NG worldwide,
compared to other fossil fuels, is because of less pollution and higher heating capacity.

The demand has increased significantly in the past few years as power plants have

replaced the fuel with the efficient use of NG. This trend will continue to rise and the
need for LNG import is necessary to supplement the growth (Pattanayak & Padhi,
2018).

LNG receiving terminals are being constructed worldwide due to the continuously
increasing demand of LNG. An LNG receiving terminal located onshore or offshore,
as a barge or a floating storage regasification unit, is needed for transporting the LNG
from the carrier and supplying it to end-users. LNG is stored in storage tanks at the

LNG receiving terminal. Prior to delivering LNG to the end-user, LNG is vaporized

through a regasiﬁcation process. Vapor continuously evaporates from LNG due to heat

absorption in the storage tank and in the cryogenic pipelines during unloading. The

vapor is called boil-off gas (BOG) which can cause safety problems in the LNG
facilities since pressure increases with the generated BOG (Park et al., 2012). After

being vaporized it is transported by long distance pipelines for distribution to the endusers. However, this is not possible for all potential end-users. For scattered or isolated

populations, factories, or power plants located at geographical hurdles, it is
uneconomical to build pipelines if the demand is low. Ensuring the gas supply for

potential end-users can be done by direct LNG distribution with the use of mobile
equipment. Distribution of LNG by road is used in cases where the existing pipeline
grid is either incomplete or under capacity (Chrz & Emmer, 2007).

Ensuring access and availability is necessary for the use of mobile equipment
delivering LNG. An LNG satellite terminal can be built where the gas infrastructure is

8

poor but the potential demand of NG as a fuel for industries is substantial (Wärtsilä,

2018). Storing and transporting NG is economical in its liquid form, whether via LNG

carriers or trucks to remote locations for end-users (Mokhatab et al., 2014f). Direct
deliveries of LNG to end-users by an LNG satellite terminal are still in an early phase
but continue to increase worldwide (Chrz & Emmer, 2007).

Monitoring LNG processes is critical for safety in any LNG facility and it is necessary

to have a reliable monitoring system for predicting and preventing process related

issues (Hong et al., 2019). The system should be designed to handle changes,

speciﬁcations, and the environment in an economic and safe manner. Performance is
controlled by the system as well as by the process (Chawankul et al., 2005). With a
well-planned system, risks of operational problems, losses and redesign for new
process can be reduced (Michelsen et al., 2010). Availability of precise data is essential

for LNG processes. Whether it is related to unloading, storage, or distribution, correct

information needs to be delivered to the control room for the process to perform
correctly (Wärtsilä, 2018).

This thesis is meant to offer process design engineers a better understanding of

measuring instruments in an LNG process. These can be general understanding of
terms, design guidelines, selection, or installation of an instrument. It can also be used
to clarify why a specific instrument is used for monitoring a part of the process in

current design. Therefore, this thesis is meant to give background knowledge. The
main objectives of the thesis are as follows: review the standard pressurized LNG
satellite terminal piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) and list requirements on
all instruments. Analyze the real need for each instrument. Find new methods and
instruments that meet the requirements of the different measuring points. Review the

control and instrument communication/connection from a reliability, safety and
economical point of view. Lastly, finalize instrumentation specifications according to
findings.

This thesis will focus on the control systems of storage, regasification, and
unloading/loading of an LNG satellite terminal. Flaring, odorization, and send-out will

not be mentioned. These systems are in the form of modules and instrument sizing

9

should be considered but not limited to the size. All the new methods that were found

cannot be applied for LNG processes. However, the new methods found are used in
processes for other cryogenic liquids. Therefore, the methods are theoretically

applicable for LNG processes. The focus will be on intelligent instruments, meaning

digital instruments which are connected to the control system and can transfer data
information. Limitations to flow measurements were made due to the amount of
available flow meters. All possible meters for cryogenic measurements are mentioned

briefly. However, the focus will be on those used for custody transfer and common
methods for flow measurement of LNG.

THEORY

This chapter includes information about LNG, safety from a process perspective, the
processes and the main equipment in an LNG satellite terminal, the control system, the
measuring instruments, custody transfer of LNG and finally standards and regulations
for instruments, installations and processes in LNG facilities.
2.1

LNG characteristics

The LNG properties varies with its composition, which depends on the gas source.
Methane is the main component, but other hydrocarbon components are found as well

(Mokhatab et al., 2014a) and can be seen in Table 1. The table includes examples of
the LNG composition, the boiling point, molecular weight, density, and volume at
atmospheric pressure. The variations of the composition will affect the properties and
therefore, typical values are used for LNG.

The LNG is noncorrosive, colorless, and odorless at atmospheric pressure. In its gas
form when used as a fuel, it is considered as a clean source of energy due to its low

carbon emission and low particle emission compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. It is

nontoxic, but if leaked into an uncontrolled environment it can lead to suffocation and

11

ignition can occur with the right concentration of air (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).
As mentioned above, the properties of LNG varies with the composition and as seen

in Table 1, the properties have deviations compared to typical properties. The typical
boiling point is -162°C for the liquid. The liquid volume is 600 times smaller compared

to natural gas and the density falls between 430 and 470kg/m3 (Mokhatab et al.,
2014a). LNG is commonly classified according to the density but can also be according

to heat value, Wobbe index, methane, or nitrogen amount (Dobrota et al., 2013). In
Table 1, the lighter LNG has a higher methane number and lower density compared to
the heavy LNG. The methane number has been calculated using the Wärtsilä methane

calculator, based on the molar content of the LNG examples. An important attribute
of LNG is the dielectric constant, which is needed for certain instruments. The LNG

dielectric constant is on average ε = 1.75 and it is utilized to detect LNG (Paillou et
al., 2008). Knowledge of the LNG properties and behavior is crucial for a successful

design, operation, and process of all types of LNG facilities (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).
2.2

Safety

LNG safety is the number one priority for LNG facilities and several factors contribute

to this safety. First, safe and secure operations have been developed for the LNG
processes. Second, the LNG properties are well understood, and the design of the
processes have been tested through multiple years of operation. Third, standards have

been developed for the LNG industry and they are continually improved to ensure
LNG safety (Mokhatab et al., 2014a). LNG hazards are still a concern, and the
responsibility to prevent incidents should not be understated and is the focus when

designing an LNG operation. The main hazards are fire, explosion, freeze burns,
embrittlement of materials, and confined spaces hazards (Mokhatab et al., 2014d).

The main safety features at an LNG facility are primary containment, secondary
containment, plant safety system, and separation distance. LNG storage tanks have a

primary and secondary containment, meaning double tank walls. The primary
containment is in contact with LNG and requires to be designed and tested for
cryogenic use. The task of the containment is to remove BOG, prevent entry of air,

12

frost heave, withstand filling, emptying, cooldown, and heating operations. Secondary

containment is designed for a capacity greater than the volume of the primary

containment. An insulation system is located at the inner wall and is constructed of
materials with a low thermal coefficient which does not embrittle in the case of contact

of LNG. Secondary containment devices are also included such as tank level gauge,

cooldown temperature sensors, and leak detection (ABS Consulting Inc., 2004). This
is discussed further in Chapter 2.6.

Explosion risk is reduced by storing the LNG above atmospheric pressure so that air
is not leaked into the tank (ABS Consulting Inc., 2004). In order to determine the risk

of explosion, a hazardous area needs to be established. A hazardous area is an area in
which explosive gas atmosphere is expected or present. In this case special precautions
for construction, installation, and use of equipment need to be considered. A hazardous

area can be divided into zones 0 – 2 for an LNG satellite terminal and can be seen in

Table 2. Determining the zones for the presence of explosive gas atmosphere depends
on several factors, e.g., flammable substance, sources of release, elimination of release,

and grade of the release. The approach for the classification can be found in EN 6007910:2015 (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2015b).

Table 2. The zones and the definition of hazardous areas for an LNG satellite terminal. Information adapted from
(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2015b) into a table.

Terms

Zone 0
Zone 1
Zone 2

Definition

An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere is present continuously, for long periods or
frequently.
An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere is likely to occur periodically or
occasionally in normal operation.
An area in which an explosive gas atmosphere is not likely to occur in normal operation
but, if it does occur, it will exist for a short period only.

Plant safety systems are designed with two layers of protection, a prevention system

which prevents loss of containment, such as pressure relief valves, and an emergency
system which includes multiple layers of emergency protection (Mokhatab et al.,
2014d). These are discussed in Chapter 2.4.

Separation distance means that the location of storage and processes needs to be a at
minimum distance away from each other at the terminal site. This can be done with
risk analysis tools such as qualitative methodologies. From a process perspective,

13

hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) are an important method to identify risks in
the process system. HAZOP is a systematic risk assessment examination of designed

operations and consequential effects on the facilities (Crowl & Louvar, 2019). The
HAZOP team includes designers and operators to review a given process. Piping and
instruments are reviewed in sequential order and each piece of equipment is evaluated

in case of operational problems. The equipment is documented by key cautions,
controls, and needs for improvement (Mokhatab et al., 2014d).
2.3

LNG satellite terminal

The LNG satellite terminal plays the role of transporting the LNG from the tanker and
supplying it to industries by pipelines (Mokhatab et al., 2014a; Park et al., 2012). It is

a small station where LNG is delivered in trucks, stored in tanks, and vaporized at site

(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2019). It is usually a
single-use type of terminal, e.g., providing gas for a power plant. However, it can also

be multi-use which includes, e.g., send-out, truck loading, and bunkering. The size

range of the terminal is 100 – 20,000 m3 and the storage tank is usually the most

expensive part of the terminal. Therefore, it is defined according to its size. The type

of tank used is mainly bullet tanks, and the terminal capacity is determined by tank

size, frequency of refilling, and operational specifications of the power plant. A 50

MW baseload plant with an average of 12 days between refilling requires a storage
capacity of approximately 5000 m3 (Wärtsilä, 2018).

The main functions are unloading, storage, vaporizing, gas quality adjustment, LNG
recovery, and pressurizing (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,
2019). The main process units in a Wärtsilä LNG satellite terminal are truck

loading/unloading, storage tank, regasification, and metering station (send-out and

odorization). These units are designed and delivered in the form of modules (Wärtsilä,

2018). These units can be seen in Figure 1. Imported LNG is stored in its liquid state
in the storage tank at the terminal. For the LNG to be delivered to the customer, it
needs to be vaporized into NG through a regasification process before being sent-out

to the power plant. LNG continuously evaporates due to heat absorption from storage

tank walls and pipelines due to warmer ambient environment compared to cryogenic

14

storage of LNG. The evaporated gas is called boil-off gas (BOG). The BOG can cause
safety problems in the LNG facilities because of the pressure build-up and temperature

that increases with the generated BOG (Park et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2007). If the BOG
is not treated in time the structure of the tank will be damaged and cause dangers (Shin

et al., 2007). The safety valves of the storage tank will open, if the pressure is too high.
The BOG will then be released into the atmosphere, resulting in economic loss and

pollution (C. Liu et al., 2010). Therefore, handling of BOG is required, but since BOG
is the same as NG, it can be released directly to the power plant in order to prevent

dangerous situations (Wärtsilä, 2018). However, other solutions exist (e.g., BOG

condensation process) which condensates and recovers BOG by utilizing LNG cold
energy. The LNG cold energy is the energy released when it is vaporized. The cold
energy is carried away by air or the heating system of the vaporizer. Solutions to
recover the cold energy has been investigated in order to reduce the heat loss in the

overall vaporization process and combining it with other LNG processes (Yuan et al.,
2019).

Figure 1. A Wärtsilä LNG satellite terminal used for a power plant – adapted from (Wärtsilä, 2018).

The unloading of LNG depends on the size of the truck but the unloading bay is

typically designed to unload LNG at 100 m3/h or less (Mokhatab et al., 2014c). The
typical process description for a satellite terminal starts with the LNG being pumped

from the truck to the storage tank. To balance the volume of the pumped LNG from

the truck, a small amount of LNG is vaporized and returned. This is done through an

15

atmospheric vaporizer or pressure-build up unit (PBU). The gas (BOG) inside the

storage tank can also be used and be sent via a vapor return line to the truck. The gas
flow rate is controlled by the trucks pressure.

The periods when the storage tank is in holding mode and there is a high pressure in

the tank, the BOG can be sent out. The BOG is warmed prior through a heat exchanger

(HEX). When the LNG is to be sent out to the customer, it must be vaporized to NG
before delivery (Chrz & Emmer, 2007). Nitrogen is used to sub cool the HEXs, the
tank storage, and pipe system prior to commissioning. Nitrogen is also used for
purging the transfer system after the unloading phase is completed (Mokhatab et al.,
2014c). A typical process of the satellite terminal is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. A flow schematic of an LNG satellite terminal (Chrz & Emmer, 2007). The LNG is unloaded at “FILL”
and enters the bottom or the top of the storage tank. It can also be sent directly to the PBU. The gas inside the
storage tank can be sent to the truck to balance the volume of the unloading. There is another separate pipe
leading to the PBU to increase the pressure which then leads back to the top of the tank as gas. Prior to the LNG
being sent out to the customer it is vaporized, heated and odorized. The storage tank includes a monitoring
system and a safety release valve to the atmosphere.

2.3.1 Modularization
Due to increasing developments in remote locations, the modularization concept has

been applied to LNG processes. The concept is used where site construction space is

limited, labor mobility is difficult, or have a sensitive environment, (Tanabe & Miyake,
2010). The concept is to design and build self-supporting, transportable structures

16

which include main components, equipment, and piping. For complex LNG plants this
can be difficult but for small-scale LNG this is an excellent option. Module design is

different compared to normal design. Limitations of the module size and weight

require safety design to be planned well and redistribution of the process equipment

compared to normal design. The design should occur from the ground up and the
redesign of the process is difficult and time consuming (Mokhatab et al., 2014e).

Modules are meant to be cost-efficient, while in order to ensure cost-efficiency. The

design needs to be innovative. The workflow must be redefined compared to normal
design and needs to consider all levels from design to installation. A successful module

should produce improved labor productivity, safety, quality, environmental footprint,
operations, maintenance, reduced startup time, and cost. In order to achieve a
successful module, these guidelines should be followed. Cooperation from all project
team members and owner personnel should be involved from the start to ensure

module configurations for operations and maintenance requirements. The basic

concept of process and piping design of modularization for the design must be known

as well. The design of the module cannot be finalized without knowledge of the details
and fabrication methodology. The design to create a module will take longer but the
quick plug-and-play connection should reduce the project schedule (Mokhatab et al.,
2014e)

2.3.2 LNG loading and unloading
When LNG consumers are located inland, the LNG needs to be delivered by truck or

train in the form of road trailers, ISO cryogenic containers, or smaller delivery units.

The unloading of the LNG trucks is done at a truck loading bay and the main purpose
of this unit is to unload the LNG to the storage tank. There is also the possibility to

load the truck with LNG if needed (Mokhatab et al., 2014a). The unloading and

loading can be done using pumps, PBU, or by pressure differential transfer between
truck and storage tank (Chrz & Emmer, 2007; European Industrial Gases Association,

2015; Sharafian et al., 2019). An example of LNG unloading with PBU, pump, or both
can be seen in Figure 3. Typical operating pressure is between 0.4 to 0.6 MPa but
depends on specifications (Chrz & Emmer, 2007).

17

Figure 3. The truck to storage tank transfer with/without vapor return by using a pump, PBU or both (Sharafian
et al., 2019). The PBU and its pipe system is removed when using the pump and the pump is removed when using
the PBU.

The truck is connected to a flexible filling hose or loading arms. Depending on the
loading rate and the capacity of the arms, multiple arms can be used and there can also

be a vapor return arm and spare arm (European Industrial Gases Association, 2015;
Mokhatab et al., 2014a). Vapor return can be added to the transfer system. This sends
vapor from the storage tank to the truck, reduces the pressure in the storage tank before

the unloading, and keeps a steady flow rate throughout the unloading process. This
process is important when the transfer system only relies on a PBU. The unloading

process cannot be started if the storage tank pressure is too high. If there is no vapor
return, the pressure will increase in the truck and reduce the pressure difference of the

truck and the tank, leading to a reduction in flow rate and an increase in the unloading
time (Chrz & Emmer, 2007; Sharafian et al., 2019). During the unloading the operation
is continuously monitored by both the truck operator, who has access to an interface

panel, and the control system using measuring instruments. For custody transfer, a
flow meter or a weigh scales can be used (European Industrial Gases Association,

2015). After the unloading is completed, nitrogen purging is used in order to drain the
remaining LNG in the arms (Mokhatab et al., 2014a) and the system is depressurized

before the truck can be disconnected from the fueling system (European Industrial
Gases Association, 2015).
2.3.3 Storage tank
Deciding the tank for storage is project-specific and should address site conditions,

design criteria, safety, geological considerations, environmental requirements, and

18

regulations. The two main types of tanks are in-ground or above ground storage tanks.
For above ground storage there are three types of tanks: single, double, and full
containment tank (Mokhatab et al., 2014a). Bullet tanks are commonly used when

storing smaller volumes of LNG. These are vacuum insulated pressure vessels which

can be vertical or horizontal depending on site size and safety concerns. They are
modular, flexible to install, and can be arranged in any desired amount depending on

the storage capacity. These tanks are designed and operated so that no BOG
compressor is required (Wärtsilä, 2018).

The vessel consists of an inner vessel, an outer vessel, perlite-vacuum, inner supports,
outer supports, LNG spray line and LNG inlet/outlet, as seen in Figure 4 (Chrz et al.,

2005; Wärtsilä, 2018). The inner vessel is composed of a self-supporting cylindrical

container made of 9% nickel steel or stainless steel and the outer vessel is composed
of carbon steel. In the annular space there is vacuum pressure and perlite is used for

insulation. This construction is made in a way that the LNG will still be contained
within the outer vessel, if the inner vessel breaks. It also limits the dispersion of vapor

(Mokhatab et al., 2014a). This ensures that LNG can be kept in the tank for several

weeks without any withdrawal or needing to be vented. With a small consumption of
LNG the pressure is reduced quickly in the storage tank (Chrz & Emmer, 2007).

Figure 4. Bullet tank storage for LNG – adapted from (Chrz et al., 2005).

There are four modes of operation for the storage tank: holding mode, the period when

there is no truck unloading/loading, unloading mode, the period when the storage tank
is being filled, loading mode, the period when the truck is being filled, and send out

mode, the period when the satellite terminal produces the NG for the power plant. Gas
can be sent out during all the modes if needed (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).

19

Operating pressure can be up to 3.5 MPa (European Industrial Gases Association,

2015) but is designed at around 1.25 MPa (Chrz & Emmer, 2007). There are multiple

operating variables that need to be ensured to maintain storage tank pressure. The fill
connections of the storage tank can be top or bottom and are permitted by internal

piping. Bottom loading is used if lighter LNG is loaded to enhance mixing and to
increase the storage tank liquid level. If the LNG is heavier, it should be loaded from

the top via a spray device or splash plate to promote flashing, mixing with the

inventory of the tank, and to reduce the storage tank pressure. By using both top and
bottom filling at the same time, the LNG flow in the process will increase. Transfer

line and tank cooldown is also required to ensure the reliability and continuous use of

the LNG process (Mokhatab et al., 2014c). There is no danger of rollover in a vacuum
insulated vessel (Chrz et al., 2005). Rollover is when two different densities of LNG
mix together and result in a large amount of vapor causing pressure build-up. Lastly

BOG is the main issue when it comes to LNG storage. However, as mentioned

previously, BOG is not an issue with bullet tanks since the BOG volume production is
less than 0.2% per day and the storage tank is capable of handling the pressure build-

up (Mokhatab et al., 2014c; Wärtsilä, 2018). To increase the pressure in the tank, a
PBU is used to vaporize LNG (European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization, 2002). A portion of the LNG is sent to the PBU, where it is evaporated

in a HEX. When evaporated, the vapor is sent back to the top of the storage tank to
create a higher pressure (Sharafian et al., 2019).
2.3.4 Regasification
The regasification units main functions are to convert LNG to NG trough vaporization
and to increase the temperature of the gas before being sent out to the end-user

(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2019). The design of the
vaporization system is determined by the site selection, environmental conditions,
regulations, and operability. Large LNG import terminals use two types of vaporizers,

mainly open rack vaporizer, and secondly submerged combustion vaporizer.
Additionally, there are ambient air vaporizers (AAV), shell and tube exchange
vaporizer, and intermediate fluid vaporizer (IFV) (S. Liu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018).

20

The AAV and the IFV are both common vaporizers used in an LNG satellite terminal.

The AAV is the preferable vaporizer due to its low operating cost and environmental
reflection (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).

The IFV is a closed loop process with an intermediate heat transfer fluid (HTF). This

is used to transfer the heat between the LNG vaporizer and the heat source. The HTF
is either ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or hydrocarbons. The heat transfer occurs
in a shell and tube HEX. The glycol-water IFV has a compact design due to the high

heat transfer coefficient. Warm glycol-water fluid is used to heat the LNG (Xu et al.,

2018). A pump is used to circulate the HTF in the system and a storage tank is placed

upstream of the pump to accommodate the volume of the fluid during operations.
Multiple options can be used to heat the HTF. It depends on what is available at site,

e.g., fired heater, air heater, waste heat recovery, or seawater exchange (Mokhatab et
al., 2014a). The process system is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. An example of the IFV process (Mokhatab et al., 2014a). A pump is used to circulate the glycol-water
(HTF) in the process. A surge drum is located upstream of the pump. The heat source HEX is the located
downstream of the pump where the glycol-water is heated. The warm glycol-water is then pumped towards the
IFV and transfers the heat to it in order to vaporize the LNG to natural gas.

Instead of glycol-water, hydrocarbons can be used as the HTF, e.g., propane or butane.
This type of IFV utilize seawater as the heat source and the vaporized HTF condensates

on the LNG HEX. By using this type of HTF, freezing can be prevented which can be

21

encountered with other types of HTF. This type of system has its limitations as it can

only be used where seawater is available and can be a significant investment while the
glycol-water can be used anywhere with the appropriate heat source (Egashira, 2013;
Mokhatab et al., 2014a).

The AAV extracts heat from the ambient air in order to evaporate LNG and do not
require a separate heating system like the IFV. It is considered more environmentally

friendly because of this and is cost competitive. However, a greater amount of AAVs
is needed in order to achieve the same effect compared to the IFV. This will require

more space at the site. For satellite terminals direct air vaporizers are used but there
are AAVs which utilize an intermediate fluid as well. The air exchange can be natural
draft or forced air operation. Typical AAV design can be seen in Figure 6 and consists

of vertical and long direct contact HEX tubes that facilitate downward air draft. This

is due to there being colder and denser air at the bottom which is heavier than warm
and less dense air (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).

Figure 6. Typical AAV schematic (Mokhatab et al., 2014a). LNG flows through a series of surface heat
exchangers. The ambient air flows downward in the AAV and heats up the LNG to NG. The cooled air and water
condensate exit the AAV at the bottom and the NG is sent to the customer.

The water condensation buildup can be collected and used as service water. In order

to prevent the ice buildup on the surface of the HEX tubes, periodic defrosting is
required multiple times daily. The longer the operating cycle of the AAV, the longer

the defrosting time (S. Liu et al., 2019). The defrosting can be done by the natural draft

22

of air or by air fans. The use of air fans will only slightly decrease the defrosting time.
However, it will help with the dispersal of fog generated from the AAV as well as with
the visibility. At locations with a warm humid temperature, the fog generation will

occur and its impact on the environment should be accounted for. The fog is generated
when the cold air from the vaporizer meets the warm and moist ambient air. The fog

can create visibility issues and interfere with the process. The AAV is advantageous
in equatorial regions with a hot climate and where the ambient temperature is high

throughout the year. The IFV is preferred in subequatorial areas where winter
temperature will affect the ambient air temperature (Mokhatab et al., 2014a).
2.4

Control system

A control system is needed in order to operate the processes at an LNG satellite

terminal. From the selection of field sensors to available information in the control

room, the choices for control and automation system impact the profitability and
effectiveness of an LNG operation. A control system which is well designed and

maintained will reduce start-up time, avoid forced shutdowns, keep operating and

maintenance cost low, uphold environmental compliance, and support operation safety

and security. The main functions of the control system are to ensure a safe and reliable
operation as well as optimize the process (Mokhatab et al., 2014b)

Safety is the most important objective in the automation. Design and functionality of
process automation is directly related to this. To achieve this, the process variables
need to be maintained in the safe operating limits which is performed by the base and

advanced regulatory loops in the system. The alarms and trips in the distributed control

system (DCS) are designed to warn operators or act during violations of the safe
operating limit. The emergency shutdown (ESD) system is designed to safely

shutdown the operation or satellite terminal in case of significant violations detected
(Mokhatab et al., 2014b).

Smooth and stable operation is another important objective of the automation. This is

achieved by the base regulatory controls. The designs and tuning of these control loops
are critical to the stable operation. For operation optimization the advanced regulatory

23

and process controls can be used to enhance the operation to be as beneficial as
possible (Mokhatab et al., 2014b).

Traditionally the design is performed sequentially where the process is designed first.
Later, the control system is designed, meaning the engineers do their work separately

(Michelsen et al., 2010). The meaning of control design is to achieve the best dynamic
performance, i.e., to maintain a specific control variable at a setpoint. This is ignored
during the design phase as the process design engineer works on selecting the best

process flow with the minimum capital and operation cost based on steady state

considerations. Later on, the control engineers will have to optimize the dynamic
performance for the given design (Chawankul et al., 2005). In order to achieve the best
possible control system for any given process, an integrated design method is required

for the process and control system. With the use of an integrated method, both the
design and the operation can be improved (Michelsen et al., 2010).
2.4.1 Distributed control system
DCS, or basic process control system, includes instrumentation, input/output devices,
control devices and operator interface devices which execute control and indication

functions, permit transmission of control, measurement and operating information to

and from single- or multiple-user at specific locations which are connected by single
or multiple communication links (Liptak, 2003).

As mentioned above, the key role of the DCS is to maintain the various process

variables for smooth and stable operation during day-to-day operations in the satellite

terminal with the use of regulatory controls and loop management (Mokhatab et al.,
2014b). The base regulatory control is the main control layer, ensuring the operation
variables being maintained. These consist of proportional, integral, and derivative

(PID) control loops. These PID control loops regulate the pressure, temperature, and
flow in the process with a response time of one second or less (Mokhatab et al., 2014b).
Advanced regulatory control handle loops that are challenging and cannot be handled

by regular PID control loops. These can be, e.g., cascade and override control. The
cascade control is when there is a master and slave controller. The override control is

24

when there are competing control objectives and an output from a loop is given priority
over another output (Mokhatab et al., 2014b).

Loop management is used to supervise the processes in the satellite terminal. This

includes controller monitoring where the performance of the PID loops are monitored
on a continues basis. Controller tuning is done with various tools in order to identify

the tuning parameters of the PID control loops. It is also used to optimize the controller
with either setpoint tracking or disturbance rejection. Remote monitoring is utilized to
identify and troubleshoot any field related problems. The system can also be accessed

remotely with a smart device if the system allows for it via ethernet or internet at any
location (Mokhatab et al., 2014b).

Real-time event management provide information for performance and tracking. This
can be used to improve the lifecycle of the process. It can also be used for alarm

management. Alarms indicate abnormal conditions in the process. If an alarm occur,
the operator will need to do adjustments of the process in order to prevent a trip or a
shutdown of the process (Mokhatab et al., 2014b).
2.4.2 Intelligent field instrument
The meaning of a device or an instrument is that it is designed for direct or indirect

measurement, monitoring, or control of a variable. This includes primary elements,
indicators, controllers, final control elements, computing devices, and electrical

devices such as annunciators, switches, and pushbuttons. The meaning of field is that
the instrument is in the vicinity of its primary element or final control element (Liptak,

2003). Intelligent relates to the instrument being connected to the control system to
transfer data such as process and equipment information to enable process control,

asset optimization, and safety functionalities (Mokhatab et al., 2014b). These

instruments are usually connected to a local control panel which connects to the control
system. By monitoring the process, the instrument senses the magnitude of one or more

variables for the purpose of deriving useful information. This can be used for analyzes,
indication, or alarm. (Liptak, 2003; van de Kamp, 2006).

25

It is important to understand the difference of a sensor, a transmitter, and a transducer.

A sensor is a separate or integral part of the instrument that senses the process variable
value. It assumes a corresponding predetermined state and generates an output signal
indicative of or proportional to the process variable. A transmitter senses the process
variable through a sensor or measuring element and has an output whose steady-state

value varies only as a predetermined function of the process variable. The sensor can
be an integral part as indirect pressure transmitter or separate as in thermocouple
temperature transmitter. Lastly, a transducer is a part of the instrument which can be a
primary element, a transmitter, a relay, or a converter that receives the information in

the form of physical quantities, modifies the information, or its form if required and
produces a resultant output signal (Liptak, 2003).

Instruments can be invasive or non-invasive and intrusive or non-intrusive. If
transducer is in contact with the fluid, it is invasive, and if it is not in contact, it is a

non-invasive sensing. If the transducer is protruded into process flow or changes the

flow profile, it is an intrusive method, and if it does not change the flow profile, it is a
non-intrusive method (Basu, 2019d).

The use of intelligent field instruments increases safety, reliability, and productivity in
the processes with precise measurement, and with the use of multivariable field

instruments, the number of instruments can be reduced. The more information
available from these instruments, the easier it is for the control room operator to
manage the system. The instruments can be connected via fieldbus, a two-way

industrial network communication system for real-time control, or remote I/O where
the instrument is connected via cable to a local control panel so that the system cannot
be altered by software. These instruments are capable of self- and process-diagnostics

to ensure that the data transferred is reliable (Mokhatab et al., 2014b). Reliability is
the probability that an instrument will perform its objective adequately, for the period

specified and under the operating conditions specified (Liptak, 2003). It is important
that the instrument used is capable of this and a high reliability is to be expected of

any system. Operators with the use of a human machine interface can easily pinpoint
locations of errors. Operators can also use instrument diagnostic tools to perform
troubleshooting. Alerts can be generated to enable operations and maintenance of

26

equipment or process conditions in LNG processes (Mokhatab et al., 2014b). Typical
response time according to EN 61298-1 is defined as 150 – 180 milliseconds (ms),
where dead time is typically 50 ms and time constant of 100 – 140 ms (Basu, 2019g).
2.4.3 Accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity
Accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity are terms that needs to be understood, when

dealing with instruments. The purpose of all measurements is to obtain the true value.

The error of the measurement is the difference between the measured and the true
value. It is impossible to know the exact error since it is impossible to measure a value
without an uncertainty. However, it is possible to state the limits of the true value. The

term accuracy, more precisely inaccuracy or uncertainty, is often misunderstood
(Liptak, 2003).

Accuracy is the ability of the measuring instrument to indicate values closely

approximating the true value of the quantity measured. Uncertainty is the true value of
the measurement that cannot be determined but estimated by statistical analysis.

Uncertainty can also be the range which the true value can be found. Precision can be
described by repeatability. Repeatability is the closeness of several measurements of

the output quantities, where the input and operating conditions are the same (Basu,

2019a). Sensitivity is the smallest amount of change that can be detected by an
instrument (Rys, 2011).

The accuracy terminology is illustrated with the help of Figure 7. The spread of the
dots located on the upper right corner represents the random error of the measurement.

The distance from the mean random error to the bullseye is the systematic error. The

systematic error is a displacement of the measured value from the true value, which
can be reduced by calibration. Repeatability is the range from the furthest points of the

dots and cannot be reduced. The dot on the lower left corner is an illegitimate error

which can be eliminated. The uncertainty is defined as the sum of the random error

and the systematic error. There is no need to know the true value of the measurement
if the purpose is to maintain the process conditions. The goal is then to reduce the

random error without worrying about the systematic error. This is common for many

27

industrial installations. However, if determining the true value is needed, the
repeatability is insufficient. The total accuracy can be obtained by reducing both the
random and the systematic errors. This is achieved by recalibration (Liptak, 2003).

Figure 7. Accuracy terminology in the form of a shooting target. Adapted from (Liptak, 2003). The bullseye
represents the true value of the measurement. The dots represent the measurement of the instrument. The distance
between them represents the uncertainty of the overall measurement.

2.4.4 Emergency shutdown system

The ESD system, or the safety instrumented system (SIS), is designed to protect

personnel, equipment, processes, and environment by reducing the likely hood or the
impact of an identified emergency event. This system is independent of the DCS and

include safety instruments. However, both systems can use the same instruments
during certain conditions. The main components of the ESD system are sensors that
collect the necessary information to determine an emergency, i.e., storage tank

overfilling. Logic solvers are used to determine the actions based on the information
from various instruments. The logic solvers have a high reliability and provide fail-

safe operations. The output of these transfers to the final control elements to implement

the required action. Final control element implements the actioned from the logic

solver to ensure the safety of the process. It can also include communication and
ancillary equipment (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,
2017a; Mokhatab et al., 2014b).

28

A small proportion of leaked LNG in the process can cause loss of containment as a
result of an explosion or a fire incident. The ESD system in the LNG satellite terminal

is used to automatically stop the LNG process and isolate leakage sections. Therefore,

the ESD system is considered an important system and requires attention. To improve
the reliability of the equipment and the operational procedures, the root cause of
undesired failures are investigated (Cheng et al., 2009).

The ESD system is based upon specific criteria’s and built upon safety instrumented

functions (SIF), which are used to maintain a safe state of the process in the case of a
specific hazardous event. The SIF is designed to achieve a required safety integrity

level (SIL), which is the ability of the ESD system to perform the required SIF when
required. The SIL consists of levels 1 to 4 and the higher the number, the higher safety
integrity. The SIL is determined by the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the
instrument used for the ESD system. The higher the SIL, the lower the PFD, the lower
the frequency of a dangerous failure causing a hazardous event (European Committee
for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2017a).

In order to achieve the required SIL and SIF, an overall safety lifecycle is found in EN

IEC 61508-1. The safety lifecycle can be seen in Figure 8 and should be followed in a
systematic manner to ensure the lifecycle of the ESD system (European Committee
for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2010).

In order to ensure the requirement of the SIL, calculations must be done. The
calculations are based on supplier data. The supplier must provide the following
information: failure rates of the components, mean time to failure, safe failure fraction,
and test intervals. Based on the SIL calculations, the safety function operation mode

is defined as a high or a low PFD, which the instrument must achieve. In order to
determine the PFD, the following values are needed from the supplier: periodic proof

of testing, failure rate of safe failures (1h), failure rate of dangerous failures (1h),

failure rate of dangerous detected failures (1h), and failure rate of dangerous
undetected failures (1h). An instrument is proven reliable if there is enough operational
experience in a restricted area, a specified functionality and documented evidence. The
supplier must follow a quality management system (VDMA, 2009).

31

2.5

Custody transfer

Custody transfer (CT) applications are mainly used in oil and gas industries. It is a
special flow measurement, where the fluid flow is defined as a metering point and

measured for sales transaction. The accuracy is the most important aspect as any errors
or uncertainties can be expensive for either parties. Therefore, this is highly regulated,

involving governments, notified bodies and contractual agreements between CT
parties (Basu, 2019a). The measuring system can be of the empty hose or the full hose

method (International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007) and includes flow
conditioning, pressure, and temperature measurement on the CT pipe referred to as

stream. The use of steam flow computers, meter prover, prover automation, density
measurement, sampling measurement, flow computation, and quality measurement are
also required (Basu, 2019a). An example of the set-up is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Custody transfer measurement with multiple streamlines (Basu, 2019a). The streamline includes
multiple meters monitoring the line. The streamlines also includes a flow conditioner, safety valves and by-pass
valves.

The following flow meters are accepted for CT of LNG by American Gas Association:

Coriolis, ultrasonic, and turbine flow meters. The first one measure the mass flow and

the others measure the volumetric flow. All the flow meters used for CT need to be
approved by a notified body (Basu, 2019a; International Organization of Legal

Metrology, 2007; The European Parliament and the Council, 2014). The three meters

and the orifice plate can be used for CT of NG. The orifice plate restrict the flow in a

pipe and calculates the mass flow based on the pressure in the pipe (Basu, 2019a). The

32

CT can also be done by weighing the total mass of the LNG trucks before and after the
unloading with a mass flow meter found in the unloading process (The European
Parliament and the Council, 2014). All the flow meters mentioned are discussed in
later chapters.

2.5.1 Cryogenic flow measurement
Due to a greater demand for cryogenics and liquified gases in the past years, there have

been an increased demand for effective measurement. At cryogenic conditions, the

liquid offers little lubrication for moving parts, and thermal shock of fluids is
problematic for transportation. Keeping elements cold, below boiling point, and
ensuring that the materials are in their purest form is challenging. Special treatment is

needed because of the temperature and two-phase behavior. Because of the presence
of bubbles within the cryogenic liquid, there will be interference on the precise
measurement. The major constraints associated with cryogenics are the two-phase

nature of the liquid, the selection of materials for the operating temperature, the
calibration at the operating temperature, and the density correction for volumetric flow
measurement and temperature correction factors (Basu, 2019f).

The selection of the correct meter is of extreme importance and the following points
need to be considered. Quality, design, and calibration must be of the highest standard,

with independent verifications. The meter must be precision crafted with the best
available materials and able to handle harsh conditions, including a wide range of
temperatures. Reliability, material quality, workmanship, proper installation, and

calibration are key influences for a reliable operation. No moving parts in the meter

are preferred over moving parts. Therefore, meters with moving parts should have
quick fault detections and spare parts. The turbine flow meter should be equipped with

a specially designed turbine rotor that spins freely, ensuring the precision. Monitoring
displayed in real time is a must for high-quality meters. Independent calibration
provides a greater level of accuracy and reliable operation (Basu, 2019f).

2.5.2 Measuring instruments directive
Measuring instruments directive (MID) is a directive that specifies the requirements

of the measuring system for CT of liquids and gases. It provides the requirements for

all applicable meters, surrounding system, installation, operation, and verification

procedures (Hägg & Sandberg, 2017). In order to use the instruments for CT, they
need to be MID certified, which means that the total system needs to have a high

enough accuracy rating (International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007). MID
certification requirements are discussed in Chapter 2.6.3.

Standards for LNG design

The design of any LNG facility needs to follow design standards, national, and local
regulations. These include, e.g., material selection, design, safety operations, and

technologies. European and American standards are commonly used around the world,

and American standards can be applied in Europe and vice versa. An international

work group was formed in 2006 under the International Organization of
Standardization. Their main task is compatibility and harmonization of LNG standards

between all countries (GIIGNL The International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas

Importers, 2019). The main standard to follow for onshore design is EN 1473
“Installation and Equipment for LNG Design on Onshore Installations”. This is a risk-

based standard that focuses on achieving a desired level of safety for the LNG facility.
Additional standards are also available and used for LNG onshore design (Mokhatab

et al., 2014d) and can be found in Chapter 5.5. The standards include requirements for
measuring instruments, installations and process specifications. These specifications
are mentioned below.

2.6.1 Standards for instruments in LNG facilities
All electrical equipment shall be installed in non-hazardous areas. If this is not

applicable, it should be installed in the area with least likelihood of an explosive
atmosphere (ATEX) (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,

2014b). All electrical equipment, instruments, and installations in hazardous areas

34

shall be followed according to EN 60079. The required number of instruments needed
is determined by HAZOP and reliability studies. Enough instruments shall be installed

to commission, operate, decommission in a safer manner (European Committee for

Electrotechnical Standardization, 2019), and include safe process control within

operation ranges and safe operations in the event of alarm or shutdown (National Fire
Protection Association, 2019). The instruments used are liquid level indicators,

pressure indicators, and temperature indicators. The accuracy of instruments used for
LNG is not specified. The only attribute given is that the accuracy shall be sufficient
for the purpose of the instrument (European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization, 2019).

The following requirements are needed for selection of the appropriate electrical
equipment: classification of the hazardous area including the equipment protection
level requirements. The classification of protection group or subgroup for electrical
equipment in the presence of gas, vapor, and dust. The specification of the temperature

class protection and ignition temperature of the gas or vapor present in the facilities.

The minimum ignition temperature of dust cloud and layer in surrounding area is
needed. The whereabouts and intendent use of the equipment must be specified.

Finally, external influences and ambient temperatures are required for the selection.

Certain output parameters for radiating or ultrasonic equipment cannot be exceeded.
Unintended ignition from radiating and heating from ultrasonic equipment need to be
considered, such as sunlight reflection and energy release (European Committee for
Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014b).

2.6.2 Standards for instruments when measuring NG
Pressure and temperature sensors with their according NG installations shall comply

with EN ISO 15970 (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,

2015a). The accuracy of these instruments is divided into four classes (A-D). The class

is based upon type of installation, capacity, and maximum permissible error (MPE).
Accuracy class A or B are suited for satellite terminal because pressure and
temperature measurements are done on pipeline. Accuracy class A has an uncertainty

less than or equal to 1.2% and class B has an uncertainty greater than 1.2% and less

35

than or equal to 2.5% (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,
2015a).

The pressure can be measured with an absolute pressure sensor or a gauge pressure
transmitter and typical selection is capacitance, strain gauge, or resonant sensors.

Capacitance and strain gauge are discussed in Chapter 3.2.1 and 3.2.4, resonant sensors

are not mentioned in this thesis. With the use of intelligent transmitters, the signal is
measured electronically, converted to digital format, sent to be stored in a
microprocessor and can be transmitted in a suitable format to instruments. For analog
transmitters, 4 to 20 mA is used for current and voltage outputs. To avoid measurement

errors, the installation shall be installed according to ISO 2186 and manufacturer

specifications. The piping between the process and transmitter shall transmit the
process variable accurately. The general requirements are to place the taps on the top
or the side of the pipeline. The mounting of the transmitter should be beside or above

the taps so that the liquid drains into the process. Impulse piping should be as short as
possible, to enable independent activities of environmental conditions. The slope of
the impulse line should be at least 0,08 m per meter downward towards the process

connection. The impulse pipes should be large enough to avoid friction and ingress of
moisture. Lastly, the impulse pipes should prevent sediment deposits and should never

be for sampling. For differential pressure transmitters (DPT), both impulse legs should
be the same temperature. The height difference between the sensing point and sensor

shall be as short as possible to avoid the effect of gravity on the measurement. For
maintenance, the connection shall include a valve in order to prevent a shutdown of
the whole process and the transmitter should be accessible (European Committee for
Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a, 2015a).

The resistance thermometer detector (RTD) is the most common measuring instrument

for temperature of NG. Errors caused by noise due to long wires, between the sensor
and the device, requires extra wires to compensate the noise. The transmitter converts
an analogue electrical signal to a digital signal which is transmitted for processing

(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a). The RTD is

discussed further in Chapter 3.3.1. A cylindrical sensing element is used for
temperature measurement. For invasive measurements, a thermowell should be used

36

to protect the sensing element. The thermowell is also intrusive. Heat losses will occur

via the probe due to thermowell but can be reduced with applying thermal insulation.

For a non-invasive and non-intrusive measurement, a pipe clamp or a welded pocket
can be used. There is no information in the standards on how these should be installed.
The pipe clamp is the cheapest option and the thermowell is the most expensive

(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a). The accuracy is
higher for the invasive measurement compared to the non-invasive. The accuracy for

invasive measurement depends on the homogenous temperature distribution and the
adiabatic compression at high velocity. The accuracy of the non-invasive methods
depends on residual heat load, vacuum and flow conditions, and thermal resistance

between the sensor and the fluid integral measurement of the surface temperature of
the piping. The accuracy of a non-intrusive measurement is between 1 – 2%. The

reliability of the instrument for the non-invasive measurement is higher than the
invasive measurement due to the risk of leakage (Müller & Süßer, 2010).

The thermometer probe shall be mounted in a thermowell to protect it from corrosion,

vibration, or excessive pressure and give easy access to the unit. The thermowell shall

mechanically resist static and dynamic loads caused by the gas flow (European
Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a). The installation can be seen
in Figure 10.

Figure 10. The RTD installation. (1) Power input, (2) transmitter, (3) sensor hex, (4) sensor adapter, (5) union of
coupling, (6) extension nipple, (7) thermowell hex, (8) wall of pipe, (9) sensitive portion of sensor, (10)
thermowell, (11) connection head, (12) thread, (E) extension length and (L) immersion length (European
Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a).

37

The RTD should be mounted vertical to the pipe wall to prevent vibration of the probe.
The temperature transducer should be electrically isolated to prevent disturbances.

Thermowells should not be installed near each other to prevent downstream probes to

endure stress as a result of vortex, shedding and vibrations. The spacing of the
thermowells should be radially around the pipeline. To ensure a good temperature
measurement, the thermowell shall protrude one third of the inside diameter measured

from the inner wall for DN 50 and above. For DN 300 and above, the design of the
thermowell can restrict the depth of insertion and is usually 75 to 100 mm. For smaller
pipes where the insertion becomes larger than three quarters of the inside diameter, the
thermowell shall be inserted in a pipe bend or obliquely at 45° to the flow direction.

Precautions should be taken regarding external temperature conditions to ensure that
the measured temperature is the same as the gas in the pipeline. Thermal insulation
around the pipe and RTD at a length of 5D on both sides should limit the effects
(European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a)
2.6.3 MID certification
There are a limited number of standards for installation and selection of instruments

for loading and unloading onshore with a truck. The NFPA 59A include requirements
for loading and unloading facilities but focus more on bleed connections, isolation,

and emergency valves (National Fire Protection Association, 2019). However, as
mentioned in Chapter 2.5, there are requirements for the measuring system during CT.
The operating conditions of the measuring system is determined by minimum measure

quantity (MMQ), flow rate (Q̇ max:Q̇ min), type of liquid, pressure range, temperature

range, Reynolds number, design of the system corresponding to the environment, and
voltage supply (International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007). The flowrate
of cryogenic liquids for meter and measuring system shall have a minimum ratio
Q̇ max:Q̇ min of five to one. The properties of the liquid to be measured by the instruments

should be specified, which are temperature, pressure, density, or viscosity (The
European Parliament and the Council, 2014).

There are five accuracy classes for meters, and cryogenic liquefied gases measured at

a temperature below -153°C are in the 2.5 class, which is the lowest accuracy class.

38

For associated measuring systems, the accuracy class is the same. The accuracy for

quantities equal or greater than 2 liters or kilograms, a meter has an MPE of 1.5% and
a measuring system of 2.5%. The associated measuring instruments’ accuracy for

temperature measurement is ± 1.0°C, pressure less than 1 MPa: ± 50 kPa, from 1 to 4

MPa: ± 5%, over 4 MPa: ± 200 kPa and density ± 5 kg/m3 (The European Parliament
and the Council, 2014). For liquid measurement the tank shall ensure a constant level

either visible or detectable at the beginning and the end of the measurement operation.

The level is constant when it settles within a range corresponding to a quantity no more

than the minimum specified quantity deviation. This is applicable for truck unloading
(International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007). The instruments should have
a high durability and be suitable for the measurement. Gas undetectable in the liquids

should not lead to an error variation greater than 0.5%. However, the error variation is

not allowed to be smaller than 1% of MMQ (The European Parliament and the
Council, 2014).

If no gas release is occurring in the liquid upstream of the meter, the need of a gas
elimination device is not required. Gas indicators should be placed downstream of the
meter. In an empty hose it may be in the form of a weir-type sight glass and used as

the transfer point. The transfer point is located downstream of the meter in delivery
systems and upstream in receiving systems. The empty hose and the full hose system

are the only allowed systems. The empty hose means a system which ensures the

emptying of the delivery hose after each measuring operation. In the full hose system,
the delivery end has a free end and the closing device must be installed as close as
possible to the end. The meter and the pipework between the meter and the transfer

point shall be kept full of liquid during measuring and shutdown periods. If this is not
met, the filling of the measuring system up to the transfer point shall be affected
manually or automatically and be monitored. A venting device shall be placed to
eliminate gases. If the reversal of flow could result in errors, a non-return valve shall
be installed (International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007).

In the empty hose measuring system the downstream pipework of the meter, and if
necessary, the upstream pipework, shall have a high point, so that all parts except the

hose in the measuring system remain full. Emptying of the delivery hose is ensured by

39

a venting valve. However, it can be replaced with a pump or compress gas injector
which is operated automatically. If this is impossible due to technical or safety reasons,

the measured quantity should be smaller or equal to the minimum specified quantity

deviation. It should not be possible to bypass the meter in normal conditions. A
manually controlled outlet may be available for purging of draining but should prevent
passage of liquid during normal operations. If there is a risk of overflowing the meter,
a limiting device shall be provided and shall be installed downstream of the meter with
sealing possibilities. The position of multi-way valves shall be visible and located by

notches, stops, or fixing devices. Deviations from this are permissible if the position

of controls form an angle of 90° or more (International Organization of Legal
Metrology, 2007).

The measuring system shall be designed according to metrological functions and MPE
is not exceeded. Non-interruptible processes shall be designed so that significant faults
do not occur or so that the facility can detect significant faults and prevent them. The

system shall automatically correct a malfunction, only stop the faulty device, and have

a visible or audible alarm for the operator that continues to alarm until the malfunction
is corrected (International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007).

For measuring systems for liquefied gases under pressure, only the full hose measuring
system is authorized. However, if a device is installed to compensate the delivered

quantity by a quantity of vapor returned in the gas line or compensation is made by

automatic calculation, a connection between the gaseous phase of the truck tank and

the receiving tank is permitted. In both cases the liquid flow shall be prevented from

the truck tank to the receiving tank by the gas return line. The design shall ensure that

the product remains in liquid state during the measurement. A thermometer well and
pressure measuring device shall be installed downstream and close to the meter for
verification purpose. Safety valves can be installed to prevent high pressure. If located
downstream they shall open to the atmosphere or have a pipe system connected back

to the receiving tank. If located upstream they should not be connected downstream to
prevent bypass of the meter. If the operation requires detachable hoses, they shall

remain full of their quantities, but they are not mandatory if there is a vapor return line
(International Organization of Legal Metrology, 2007).

40

2.6.4 Standards for storage tank instruments and processes
Storage tanks shall be installed with instruments to ensure overfill and overpressure
protection. To monitor the level of LNG, the level instrument needs to have continuous

measurement of the fluid level and high-level detection (European Committee for
Electrotechnical Standardization, 2019). If an overflow pipe is installed it should be
placed at least at the same level as the high-level detection (European Committee for
Electrotechnical Standardization, 2002). Pressure instrument should allow for

continuous pressure monitoring, and detection of high pressure must be done by an
independent instrument (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,
2019).

2.6.5 Standards from control system point of view
The system shall include safety control, process control and all the instruments shall

be functionally tested prior to operation. Some instruments can have individual
shutdown signals. The control system shall have a high reliability, configured to fail-

safe, and data transmission shall be designed to maximize reliability. The reliability of
the instruments is measured by the instruments to be able to maintain normal

operations. Instruments related to safety operations require redundancy when

maintenance is required. Threshold detectors which have a safety function are to be

independent of the process measurement. Temperature transmitter shall be installed in
vent stack and flare line downstream of relief valves to trip the ESD system in case of
liquid detection (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2019).

The safety system shall check the instruments for their availability, suitability of the

measuring range, correct performance of operation, safety operation, appropriate
arrangement, safe venting location and their performance in the event of a power cut
or

loss of

pneumatic supply (European Committee for Electrotechnical

Standardization, 2003).

For the ESD system, all SIF must be identified with their input and output signals. The

communication interface needs to ensure that any failure shall not affect the ability of
the ESD system to achieve or maintain a safe state of the process. The communication

41

interface shall be robust in order to withstand electromagnetic interference including

power surges. The connection interface shall be suitable for instruments referenced to
different electrical ground potentials, meaning alternate mediums, e.g., fiber optics.
The connections between the instruments and the ESD system shall have a response
time within the process safety time. The process safety time is the time period between

a failure occurring in the process or the DCS alarming a hazardous event, and the

occurrence of the hazardous event if the SIF is not performed (European Committee
for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2017a).

The maximum allowable response time of the ESD system starts when the process is

at trip condition. It ends when the final elements reach their safe state and are still able
to prevent the hazard. A response time of one minute or less is considered adequate

for each SIF unless otherwise noted (European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization, 2017b). Instruments should be selected and installed to minimize
failures that result in inaccurate information due to the operating environment.

Corrosion, freezing of materials in the pipes, suspended solids, polymerization,
coking, temperature extremes, pressure extremes, and finally condensation in dry-leg
and wet-leg impulse lines should all be considered (European Committee for
Electrotechnical Standardization, 2017a).

CRYOGENIC MEASURING TECHNOLOGY

This chapter includes parameters for the standard satellite terminal, the measuring
methods for cryogenic processes, the information and attributes needed for comparing
the measuring methods. The comparison of the methods is done in order to determine
the best fit for the process. The parameters of the LNG satellite terminal are shown in
Table 4. The parameters are based on Wärtsilä’s internal design parameters used in a

standard pressurized LNG satellite terminal. These are used to determine if an
instrument is suitable for monitoring the LNG process.

3.1

Cryogenic measuring methods

The range of low temperatures is referred to as cryogenic. The range is not defined in

literature but general agreement is temperatures less than -153°C and are, e.g., liquid

nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane (Shokrani et al., 2013). The methods found as
possible measuring methods for monitoring cryogenic processes, can be seen in Table

5. These methods are according to literature and vendors. The flow measurements have
been divided into three groups as there are multiple ways of measuring the flow rate.

If the method deviates from the parameters of the LNG satellite terminal, the method

will not be investigated further. To determine which method is the best fit for the

satellite terminal, information and attributes are needed. The information and attributes
are method description, research, or commercial availability, technical specification,

accuracy, measurement range, transmitter, installation method, reliability, cost,

advantages, and disadvantages. These will be used to compare the measuring methods.
For the flow meters only Coriolis, turbine, ultrasonic, and orifice will be discussed

thoroughly. This is because they are the most common methods used for LNG flow

measurement. They can also be used for CT of LNG, expect orifice, as mentioned in

Chapter 2.5. The other flow measurement methods found will only be mentioned
briefly.

44

3.2

Pressure measurement

The pressure is an important parameter to monitor in cryogenic applications (Arpaia

et al., 2018). This is monitored to prevent overfilling, leakage in a storage tank,
ensuring high enough pressure in pipelines, or detecting pressure drop in a process
(Roos & Myers, 2015). A common and easy method for measuring pressure at

cryogenic temperatures is to install a capillary line between the pressure location and

pressure transducer at ambient temperature. This method is however limited in
measurement of static pressure and at low pressure ranges. Most commercial pressure

sensors are designed for use at ambient temperature and cannot be used at cryogenic
temperatures (Radebaugh, 2016). The five methods presented below are exceptions
and are commonly used at cryogenic temperatures.
3.2.1 Capacitive
The operating principle in a capacitive pressure sensor is the measurement of
movement of an elastic element. An example of the capacitive pressure sensor can be

seen in Figure 11. The element is exposed to the process pressure on one side and to

the reference pressure on the other side. Absolute, gauge, or DP can be used depending
on the reference pressure. These sensors are used as secondary standards for low
absolute or low DP operations (Liptak, 2003).

45

Figure 11. A capacitance pressure detector with two capacitor plates (Liptak, 2003). The pressure of the process
will cause changes on the diaphragm. The change can be detected by an oscillator and is then converted into
capacitance.

These sensors have an accuracy of ±1 to 2% of span. Depending on the elastic element

they can operate between pressure ranges of 80 Pa to 35 MPa (Liptak, 2003).
According to Radebaugh (2016) capacitive sensors in the range of 20 – 50 pF have a
5% change of sensitivity when cooled from 27 to -269°C.

Two research articles on capacitive pressure sensors for cryogenic conditions were

found, the first a DP sensor and the second a gauge pressure sensor. The first one has

a sensitivity of 0.02 Pa/Hz(1/2) with changing of less than 10% from a temperature range

from -270 to 27°C (Swanson et al., 2001). The second one was tested in conditions of
temperature ranges from -196 to 100°C and pressure range of 0 to 5 MPa. The
measurement systems had an accuracy of 1% (Lago et al., 2014).

The advantages are a high accuracy, rangeability, linearity, and fast response time. The
disadvantages are the temperature sensitivity, the short leads from the sensor, a high

output impedance, sensitivity to stray capacitance, sensitivity to vibration, low

overpressure capability, and sensitivity to corrosion (Liptak, 2003). A coaxial cable
between the sensor and the electronics is required. The capacitive pressure sensor is a

common type of pressure sensor used for cryogenic temperatures in laboratory

environment. However, it is not commercially available for cryogenic temperatures

46

(Radebaugh, 2016). Therefore, information regarding installation method, transmitter,

and reliability has not been found. They can however be used to measure the
temperature of NG and the installation method is described in Chapter 2.6.2.
3.2.2 Inductive
Two kinds of magnetic pressure transducers have been tested for use in cryogenic

applications (Arpaia et al., 2018). These magnetic phenomena are induction and
reluctance. Inductance utilize the amount of electromotive force in an electric circuit

while reluctance is the resistance to magnetic flow. These utilize the magnetic

phenomena in converting the elastic movement of a sensor into an electric signal.
When the pressure sensor detect a pressure change the inductance or reluctance will
change in an electric circuit (Liptak, 2003).

An inductive pressure sensor use inductance to convert the flexing of a diaphragm into

the linear movement of a ferromagnetic core. The movement of the core is used to vary
the induced current generated by an AC power primary coil on another secondary coil
(Arpaia et al., 2018). A schematic representation is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12. Schematic of an inductance pressure transducer (Liptak, 2003).

Academic researchers have developed a superconducting pressure gauge and

controller system to stabilize pressure within 1 mPa in the pressure range of 0 – 3 MPa

at temperatures below -267°C for liquid helium (Geng et al., 2000). The transducer is
based upon another academic research project using a superconducting technique

called “superconducting quantum interference device” or SQUID magnetometer

(Pobell, 2007). A rod is attached to the center of the diaphragm which supports a
superconducting plate. A spiral-superconducting coil is in proximity and the SQUID
magnetometer measures the magnetic field change caused by the pressure change

47

(Figure 13). A disadvantage with this method is the lack of immunity toward external
magnetic fields (Arpaia et al., 2018). A commercial inductive pressure sensor for
cryogenic conditions has not been found.

Figure 13. General architecture of the superconducted transducer for pressure measurement (Arpaia et al.,
2018).

3.2.3 Reluctance

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the reluctance pressure sensor is a magnetic
pressure transducer. Electrical reluctance is the equivalent of electrical resistance in a
magnetic circuit (Liptak, 2003).

The sensor has inductive coils on both sides of the diaphragm (Figure 14). The
magnetic reluctance is the function of the gap between the diaphragm and the “E” core.

When the DP is zero, the magnetic flux in the coils have equal reluctance. When

pressure is applied, the reluctance will change the inductance of the two coils and is

measured by using an AC bridge where the output voltage is proportional to the
pressure (Liptak, 2003; Pavese & Beciet, 2012; Radebaugh, 2016).

Figure 14. Reluctance pressure transducer and cross section (Radebaugh, 2016).

48

Commercial reluctance transducers are available on the market. For cryogenic

applications an all welded construction is the only viable option (Radebaugh, 2016).

Radebaugh (2016) reports of various models of reluctance transducers that have been
tested for cryogenic conditions with positive results. However, these have been tested

at a pressure below 100 kPa. From 27 to -196°C, the transducers showed a decrease of

12% in sensitivity at the mentioned pressure. One case of a pressure test at 5 MPa is
presented, and the result is a large deviation from linearity at a low temperature

of -269°C. No result of a test between the pressure range of 0.1 to 5 MPa has been
found.

The calibration and the vibration test of the reluctance pressure transducers are

reported in a research article with successful results. However, the same problem as
above is that the pressure range is below 1.4 MPa. A 6% decrease in sensitivity was

presented when the temperature was dropped from 27 to -231°C. After repeated

temperature cycling, the pressure transducer had an accuracy of ±1% in liquid helium
(Kashani et al., 1990).

The advantages are as follows: the applicability to a wide temperature range, a good

dynamic response of measurements, low sensitivity to shock and vibration, and high
output signal. The disadvantages are sensitivity to temperature, requirement for AC
excitation and susceptibility to magnetic fields (Liptak, 2003; Validyne Engineering,

2020). The cost of the transducer has not been found. The general installation
procedure is as follows: the transducer should be mounted on a flat and vertical surface

to prevent strain of the transducer body. By mounting the transducer above the pressure
point, less dirt is trapped in the system and the interior is cleaner. For gauge pressure

measurement, a simple shutoff valve should be installed on the pipeline for the

maintenance of the transducer. For DP measuring, two shutoff valves need to be
installed on both sides of the pressure source to the transducer. A bypass valve need to
be installed parallel to the transducer as well as a drain valve (Validyne Engineering,
2020).

49

3.2.4 Piezoresistive
The piezoresistive pressure sensor or strain-gauge sensor is the most common
commercial pressure sensor and can detect absolute, gauge, and DPs. It utilize a strain
gauge to measure the deflection of a diaphragm from the pressure on one side
(Radebaugh, 2016). The piezoresistive material changes the resistance value when it

is compressed or strained. The sensor connects the diaphragm to four piezoresistors,
installed as a Wheatstone bridge (Figure 15). The resistance is converted into voltage

variations and correlates to the pressure on the diaphragm (Arpaia et al., 2018; Liptak,
2003)

Figure 15. Piezoresistive pressure sensor for cryogenic media: (1) pressure channel, (2) housing, (3) membrane,
(4) cartridge clip, (5) strain unit, (6) metal-glass contact unit, (7) cantilever with two strain gauges and (8) cover
with a Wheatstone circuit (Maryamova et al., 2000 and Liptak, 2003).

The use of the piezoresistive sensor has grown due to a technique called Micro ElectroMechanical Systems. The technique is used to make the sensors small, inexpensive,

have a low power usage, and a fast response time. With the proper selection of
materials, the sensor can be used at cryogenic temperatures. Research efforts have been
made to make them suitable for low pressures and wide temperatures (Arpaia et al.,

50

2018; Radebaugh, 2016).
Piezoresistive sensors have been designed and manufactured to measure the cryogenic
fluid pressure with an accuracy of 0.25% up to 30 MPa for liquid hydrogen (Shams et
al., 2001). Other sensors have also been reported for use in cryogenic conditions with

operating ranges of 0 to 10 MPa and -231 to 27°C (Maryamova et al., 2000). The cost
of the transducer is between €450 to €1,600 and for equipment €70 to €1,400. The
cabling can be done with a four-wire conductor, shielded or twisted pair. The sealing

surface must be smooth and free from irregularities when mounting the transducer.

The use of excessive torque during the installation or improper placement of the

sealing can lead to distortion and the sensitivity of the instrument is affected (Carter et
al., 2018).

This type of transmitter is also safety certified according to IEC 61508 series, meaning
it has a high reliability and SIL. The transmitter is also approved for ATEX areas. The
transmitter should be installed as close to the process as possible with a minimum

amount of piping for best accuracy. The transmitter is usually only capable of handling
an ambient temperature of -40°C, therefore, cannot be in contact with the fluid. The

transmitter should be installed parallel to the ground and if it is mounted on its side,
the coplanar flange must ensure proper venting and draining. The process flanges

should be mounted with enough clearance for process connections (Emerson
Automation Solutions, 2017).

For liquid measurement the impulse piping should be placed to the side of the line to

prevent depositions on the transmitter process isolators. The transmitter should be
beside or below the taps to ensure the gas can vent into the process line. Drain/vent
valve should be mounted upward to allow gases to be vented. For gas measurement,
the impulse pipe taps should be on the top or the side of the line, and the transmitter

should be beside or above so the liquid will drain into process line. The installation

procedure in Chapter 2.6.2 can be used, but the slope of the impulse pipe should be
upward. The piping between the process and the transmitter must accurately transfer

the pressure to obtain accurate measurement. Five possible sources for errors can be

pressure transfer, leaks, friction loss when purging, trapped gas in liquid line, and

3.2.5 Piezoelectric
When the piezoelectric pressure sensor is exposed to pressure, the sensing element in
the form of crystals will produce an electric potential and a flow of the electric charge

is presented (Figure 16). With an amplifier this charge is converted into a voltage
output but will decay with time. Therefore, this sensor cannot measure the static

pressure but instead measure the pressure change or the dynamic pressure (Liptak,
2003; Radebaugh, 2016).

Figure 16. Piezoelectric pressure sensor (Liptak, 2003).

The materials of the sensor and the installation method are suitable for cryogenic use.

Commercially available sensors can be found for temperatures down to -196°C and
operate at a pressure range between 0.3 to 35 MPa. The accuracy for the sensor is low.

Typical error is 5% and it can be 0.07%/°C which results in low accuracy at low
temperatures (Radebaugh, 2016).

The advantages are their small size, a high-speed response time, a rugged construction,

and self-generated signal. The disadvantages are limitations on dynamic measurement,
temperature sensitivity, and a special cabling and output amplifier is required (Liptak,

52

2003). The price of the transducer is between €600 to €5,500. The price of the
equipment is between €360 to €3,000. This is because the required coaxial cable is

expensive. The transducer is installed in the same way as for the piezoresistive
transducer but it is smaller in size as it eliminate a case-mounting (Carter et al., 2018).
3.3

Temperature measurement

The modern temperature scales follow the International Temperature Scale of 1990

(ITS-90). The scale extends from -208 to 1085°C and is a near approximation to a true
thermodynamic temperature scale. Most commercial thermometers for cryogenic
temperatures are resistors, thermocouples, diodes, or capacitors. These are mentioned
below with the addition of fiber Bragg grating sensors, which have been developed for

cryogenic temperatures. A good thermometer should be stable over time and have a

high sensitivity. It should also have a fast response time when dealing with dynamic
measurement (Radebaugh, 2016).

3.3.1 Resistance temperature detector
The RTD is based upon increasing electrical resistance of conductors with increasing

temperature. The RTDs are made of pure metal and the most common one is made of

platinum. A standard platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) can be seen in Figure 17.
The PRT is the international standard for temperature measurement between the triple

point of hydrogen (13.8 K) and freezing point of antimony (904 K). It can be found
commercially for ranges between -200 to 850°C (Liptak, 2003).

Figure 17. Cross section of a capsule type standard platinum resistance thermometer (Radebaugh, 2016).

The relationship between the temperature and the resistance changes of an RTD is
referred to as an alpha curve. The PRT has a temperature coefficient which can be

calculated by using Equation (1). In order to satisfy the ITS-90 conditions, the

53

temperature coefficient should fulfill the European standard curve (DIN IEC 60751)

found in Equation (2). For the best accuracy, the actual temperature coefficient should
be specified (Liptak, 2003; Radebaugh, 2016).
−
∗
Where

α = Temperature coefficient

R100 = Resistance of RTD at 100°C

This technically has units (Ω/Ω°C) because the 100 in the denominator represents a

100°C temperature change but conventionally α is dimensionless (Radebaugh, 2016).
≥

⁄

(2)

The instrument used with an RTD must be configured to use the same alpha curve or

significant errors will occur. For an industrial PRT, the resistance at 0°C is 100 Ω and
can be of three different tolerance grades (A, B and C). The A-grade has the least

uncertainty of ±0.47°C at -200°C and ±0.13°C at 0°C (Liptak, 2003; Radebaugh,
2016).

In order to determine the process temperature, the change in total resistance of the

RTD must not be affected by anything other than the process temperature. In order to
achieve this, two- to four-lead wires are installed between the RTD and the transmitter.

The two-lead wire application is rare since the error introduced by the lead wires may
cause significant errors. This is avoided for installations where a high accuracy is
required (Liptak, 2003).

When using three-lead wires, the accuracy is increased, but terminal corrosion and

loose connections can still create significant errors. A 1 Ω difference for a PRT can
cause an error of 2.6 °C. In Figure 18, the three-lead wire connection can be seen.

Wires A and B are connected to different halves of the bridge therefore the total lead
resistance will be the difference between B and A. The connection to devices with

three wire extension cables will produce errors that will wary with the environmental
conditions. For high-precision measurements the four-lead wire connection should be
considered as it completely eliminates the lead wire effect (Liptak, 2003).

54

Figure 18. Three lead wire connection. The lead wire effect is reduced to the difference between lead wire A and
B (Liptak, 2003).

The total lead resistance will be eliminated by using the four-lead wire connection.
The RTD can either be connected to a null-balance bridge or a constant current source
(CCS). The null-balance bridge connection is shown in Figure 19. It operates by
making alternate null-balance measurements in the two configurations which cancels

out the lead wire effect. This method is complex and expensive. The other method
achieves the same accuracy and is inexpensive. The CCS with a four-lead wire

connection can be seen in Figure 20. The bridge is replaced by a digital voltage meter
which only measures the resistance of the RTD. The digital voltage meter is insensitive

to the lead wires since there is no current flowing through them. The lead resistance

will not contribute to any errors since there is no voltage drop measured (Liptak, 2003).

Figure 19. Four lead wire connection using null-balance bridge. The connection results in the lead wire effect
being eliminated (Liptak, 2003).

55

Figure 20. Four lead wire RTD connected to CCS and DVM readout (Liptak, 2003).

The three wire RTD is used for industrial processes, but for cryogenic processes the

use of the four wire RTD is recommended due to their high precision measurement. In

order to protect the RTD from its surroundings, a protective thermowell and fixed
length leads are recommended (Liptak, 2003). In Figure 21, the typical thermowell
protection with an assembled RTD can be found. The best location to have the RTD is

on top of the thermowell which can be seen in the figure. The location eliminates leadwire and noise effects. If the placement of the RTD is impossible, the lead wires should

be twisted and shielded (Liptak, 2003). In Figure 22 two types of surface mounted
RTDs can be seen and in Figure 23 the alternative surface mountings are shown.

Figure 21. Commercial RTD and thermowell installation (Liptak, 2003).

Figure 23. Alternative mounting for surface mounted RTD and thermocouple (Liptak, 2003).

In Table 6, the performance of the RTD transmitters are summarized. Intelligent

transmitters have better performance but still have a minimum error. The digital output
provides better performance than the analog output. The Intelligent transmitters are

flexible meaning they can be used for multiple thermocouples and RTD elements.
They also have self-diagnostic and self-calibration. The RTD transmitter can also be

included with dual RTDs, which provides temperature differentials, high/low
capability, or redundant backup. The dual method is unfortunately only available for

57

three lead wire connections because of the limited terminal connection. These

transmitters have a wide variety in universal input, configuration, and protocol
selection (Liptak, 2003).

The RTD has a high accuracy, stable operation, and sensitive thermal abilities. That is

why it is used to define parts of ITS-90. A disadvantage with RTDs is the error
produced by self-heating which increases with the size and resistance of the RTD.

Other disadvantages are as follows: a higher cost, more fragile construction, and bigger

size compared to thermocouples. An RTD sensor with a transmitter and thermocouple
can range between the price of €300 to €1,800. This depends on the level of
intelligence and features of the instrument (Liptak, 2003).

The transmitter can be installed on top of the thermowell or it can be field mounted
with a threaded sensor. The thermowell should be attached to the measuring point of

the pipe or the process container wall. For the on top installation, the transmitter should
be assembled to the sensor and an extension is added in accordance to the transmitter

being in the range of the ambient temperature. For field mounted installation,
necessary extension nipples and adapters to the thermowell should be attached, sealed

and then the wire to the sensor should be connected to the remote transmitter. Leadwires should be attached from the sensors to the transmitter. The lead-wires should be

thermally anchored at multiple points between the ambient temperature to ensure that

58

no heat conduction occurs for the sensor. The temperature transmitter is SIL certified
(Emerson Automation Solutions, 2018).
3.3.2 Semiconductor
The semiconductor-like resistance thermometer has an operational temperature range

between -173 and -270°C (Radebaugh, 2016). This temperature range is lower than
the LNG boiling point and the design parameters of the LNG satellite terminal. The

PRT is a proven superior temperature measurement for the design temperature and

most semiconductors does not follow a standard response curve as the PRT do.

Therefore, the semiconductor-like resistance thermometer will not be investigated
further.

3.3.3 Diode
Diodes are two-terminal electronic devices that allow the current to flow in only one
direction. There are two types of diode thermometers that can be used for cryogenic
applications, silicon (SI) diodes and germanium (GaAlA) diodes. Originally, the SI

diode was limited to a temperature range of -51 to 149°C, but special SI diodes have
been researched and manufactured to handle the same range as for GaAlA diodes,

which are -251 to 43°C (Liptak, 2003; Radebaugh, 2016). The GaAlA diode is shown
in Figure 24.

The diodes are sensitive, linear and have an accuracy of 0.2% at cryogenic
temperatures. The sensor can detect small temperature differences, has a high

accuracy, available in small sizes, and low cost. The SI diode follows a standard
temperature curve while the GaAlA diodes must be individually calibrated therefore
increasing the cost. Magnetic fields effect the SI diode measurement. A calibrated

diode with packaging, mounting for cryogenic use and monitoring readouts cost
approx. €1300 (Liptak, 2003; Radebaugh, 2016). No installation method has been
found for the diodes or the type of transmitter used.

59

Figure 24. GaAlA diode thermometer circuit (Liptak, 2003).

3.3.4 Thermocouple
A thermocouple (TC) utilizes the thermopower or the Seebeck Effect. The assembly

includes two different types of wires which are joined together at one end, referred to
as the hot end. The other end, cold end, is connected to an instrument measuring the

Seebeck voltage or the open circuit voltage. The voltage appears from the temperature

difference of the two ends and the Seebeck coefficients of the two wires (Liptak, 2003;
Radebaugh, 2016).

A 0°C reference junction is the most common type of TC which is show in Figure 25.

However, the reference junction can be at any temperature. TCs are characteristic for
measuring a small temperature differences and the set-up can be seen in Figure 26.

Several types of metal combinations can be used for the TC and are decided by melting
points, reaction to various atmospheres, thermoelectric output, electrical conductance,

stability, repeatability, cost, and ease of handling and fabrication (Liptak, 2003;
Radebaugh, 2016). The most common types of TCs used for cryogenic temperatures

are shown in Table 7. The table includes information such as the type, wire pair,
temperature range, standard error, advantages, and disadvantages.

The TC is manufactured with a protective outer sheath which uses the insulating

material to electrically separate the TC from the sheath. The sheath also provides
environmental and mechanical protection. The TC require an electrically isolated
measuring circuit. The TC insulation will breakdown with time and measurement

errors will occur. Therefore, an instrument with full isolation should be used to
eliminate the possibility of the breakdown. The accuracy of the TC depends on the
wire material and should be made from the same coil of wire to ensure the accuracy.

TC types for cryogenic use have specific extension wires which are designed to be
installed at the cold junction of the loop. A Thermowell is supplied to protect the TC
from mechanical damage, the fluid and its environment (Liptak, 2003). The assembly
of the thermowell for the TC can be seen in Figure 27 and the mounting techniques is
shown in Figure 23.

61

Figure 27. TC and thermowell installation (Liptak, 2003).

The transmitter, the protocol, and the flexibility of the TC are similar to the properties
mentioned in 3.3.1. With the use of extension wires for cryogenic processes issues are

associated and the best alternative is to have the transmitter on top of the thermowell,
which can be seen in Figure 28. It can be expensive to have the transmitter on top of

the thermowell since the cost of the cabling can be high from the TC to the control

room. The transmitter is ATEX proof and has an accuracy of 0.05% of full range
(Liptak, 2003).

Figure 28. Thermocouple with transmitter mounted on top of thermowell (Liptak, 2003).

62

The advantages are as follows: low cost, large variety of sizes, ruggedized
construction, versatile installation, wide temperature range, accurate readings, and fast

response time. The disadvantages are a weak output signal because of its sensitivity to

disturbance, the requirement of amplifiers, and the fact that calibration errors are
induced over time. The largest size of lead wire should be used for the measurement.

Stress and vibrations should be avoided in the process. The price of the thermocouple

element, including the transmitter and the thermowell, is between €700 and €1,800.
This depends on the design and additional features (Liptak, 2003). The method of
installation is the same as for the RTD, found in Chapter 3.3.1.
3.3.5 Capacitance
The capacitance thermometer has a temperature range between -271 and 27°C and a

high accuracy. It is mostly used for applications where a strong magnetic field is
present (Radebaugh, 2016). For that reason alone, it will not be investigated further
since the magnetic field is not an issue for the processes of an LNG satellite terminal.
3.3.6 Fiber Bragg grating
The FBG sensor uses optical technology where the Bragg wavelength shifts are
measured to establish the temperature of a treated section on the core fiber material.

When exposed to UV light, the specified Bragg wavelength related to its grating period

is reflected from the source light. As the temperature changes, the Bragg wavelength

shifts which correlates to the measured temperature. The FBG sensors have not been
applicable for cryogenic use (Liptak, 2003), but with the help of research a solution
developed for cryogenic use has been found for monitoring in the LNG storage tank

(Hong et al., 2019). The basic principle of the gratings, the wavelength of the reflected
spectrum, and the design of the FBG sensor can be seen in Figure 29.

63

Figure 29. Operation and design of an FBG sensor for cryogenic use (Hong et al., 2019).

The reason for developing the FBG sensor for cryogenic tank monitoring is because
traditional electric sensors has a high risk of explosion caused by sparks. Optical fiber

sensors are therefore a suitable option given their dielectric nature (Hong et al., 2019).

The sensor has been tested in a tank with 3 m3 liquid nitrogen at 2 MPa because of the

safety hazards of LNG and RTD sensors are used as reference and validation. The test

proved that the FBG sensor could be used in a temperature range of -190 to -80°C for
LNG tank monitoring with an accuracy of ± 0.35°C at the lowest temperature. The test

also proved that there is a linear relation between the wavelength and the temperature

(Hong et al., 2019). The equation for determining the temperature is shown in Equation
(3).

The constants can be determined from the correlation of temperature and the reflected
wavelength. The FBG sensor can effectively measure the temperature in an LNG tank

and it has similar dynamic performance as to an RTD sensor. However, they are not
commercially available but will be in the near future (Hong et al., 2019).
3.4

Level measurement

There is no ideal level measurement technology. In a perfect world all measurements
would be nonintrusive and noninvasive (Liptak, 2003). This is however not practical

and the determining of the liquid level can be a problem (Radebaugh, 2016). Selecting
a level instrument should be based on the affecting factors and the desired qualities of

the instrument. In practice there is a tendency to select a DP sensor and the
performance is what it is. This is often not the best solution. This type of instrument

can run into problems for low pressure tap handling. If the level indication must be
independent of density, radar, or capacitive measurement can be used (Liptak, 2003).
An example utilizing radar for pressurized bullet tank is shown in Figure 30. The
following chapters include DP sensor, radar, capacitive, and five other level
measurement methods for cryogenic use.

Figure 30. Tank gauging configuration for pressurized horizontal tank. Adapted from - (Hägg & Sandberg, 2017)

65

3.4.1 Capacitive
A capacitive sensor allow for continues measuring of the liquid and utilizes the

difference in the dielectric constant for liquid and gas state (Matsumoto et al., 2011;
Sawada et al., 2003). It can also be used for level detection and the capacitance is

decided by the medium (van de Kamp, 2006) and is formed when a level sensing

electrode is installed in a tank. The electrodes of the sensor refer to one plate of the

capacitor and the second plate is the tank wall or the reference electrode. As the

medium level changes, the electrode is displaced by the different dielectric constant of
the gas/liquid phase and a charge in the capacitance occurs. The capacitance is

proportional to the dielectric constant and as the medium level raises the parallel plates
will increase the capacitance as a function of height. The transducer is designed in the
form of two coaxial tubes isolated from each other as seen in Figure 31 (Arpaia et al.,
2018).

Figure 31. Capacitive transducer for liquid measuring. C is capacity, H is height of the transducer, D is the outer
diameter of electrodes, d is the inner diameter of the electrodes, h is the height of the cryogenic liquid, ∊rl and ∊rg
are the dielectric constants of the liquid and the gas (Arpaia et al., 2018)

The accuracy of the capacitive sensor depends on the transducer and the electronics

used (Celik et al., 2001) but can be down to a sub-millimeter of a meter (Matsumoto

et al., 2011). The measurement is affected by temperature, distance between electrodes

66

and contamination of the dielectric material (Arpaia et al., 2018). Research has been

made to increase the accuracy, the sensitivity of the capacitive sensor, and for use of

different types of cryogenic liquids, e.g., liquid nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen (Celik

et al., 2001; Matsumoto et al., 2011; Medeova et al., 1998). This method is
commercially available and used for liquid nitrogen (Radebaugh, 2016) and also in
petrochemical industries (van de Kamp, 2006). Therefore, this method is applicable

for LNG, but no information has been found on it being used for LNG tank level
measuring.

3.4.2 Superconductive
Conductive sensors cannot be used at cryogenic temperatures and for this reason
superconductive sensors have been developed. The superconductive sensor works by

applying current through a superconducting wire. The wire is partially absorbed in the
liquid. The part of the wire which is in the gas state will function as normal while the

liquid state part of the wire will be superconducting. Due to the liquid part staying
superconducting, the wire resistance is proportional to the length above the liquid
(Arpaia et al., 2018). A simplified schematic can be seen in Figure 32.

Figure 32. Principle of superconductive level measuring. (Arpaia et al., 2018).

An increase in sensitivity and a reduction of heating can be done with the proper

selection of wire material, so that the superconducting wire has a critical temperature

slightly higher than boiling point of the liquid (Radebaugh, 2016). Superconductive

sensors are used in liquids (e.g., helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen) (Karunanithi
et al., 2015; Maekawa et al., 2015) and are commercially available (Radebaugh, 2016).

67

Superconductive sensors have shown higher precision and linearity compared to other
sensors such as capacitive sensors. A drawback of the superconductive sensor is the
heat input (Matsumoto et al., 2011) but this can be overcome with a pulsed power
supply (Arpaia et al., 2018).
3.4.3 Optical fibers
Optical fiber-based sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference, chemically

inert, spark-free, and can include multiple fibers in one sensor which reduces its cost.

It operates by using the change of the refractive index between liquid and gas phase.
A fiber optic sensor includes a LED or a laser transmitter, a sensing element, and a
receiving photodiode. It can be used for both discrete and continuous level measuring.
Due to cryogenic liquids having smaller refractive indexes compared to water,
commercial methods cannot be used. Therefore, techniques based on light scattering

of self-heated fiber immersed in liquids have been developed. Because of the larger
specific heat and thermal convection rates of liquid the temperature rise is smaller than

the gas. The light of the optical fiber sensor is scattered and by the temperature
difference of the phases, the liquid level is detected (Arpaia et al., 2018).

As mentioned above, no commercial optical fiber level sensor has been found.

However, researches have been found on the method for cryogenic use. The first

method is an array of the FBG sensors which have been tested for liquid nitrogen
at -196°C (Chen et al., 2011). The second one is based on Optical Frequency Domain

Reflectometry (OFDR) measurement of fiber Rayleigh scattering and is shown in

Figure 33. The light from the laser is split into measurement and reference. Based on

the measurement light reflected from the tank, compared to the reference, the time

delay between them is proportional to the liquid level. Depending on the angle of the

light sent out from the optical fiber sensor, the liquid or vapor of the medium can be
measured. The refractive index of the medium will reflect the light back. The response

time of the measurement is different, if the measurement is from vapor to liquid or

submerged in the liquid (Yang et al., 2001). This method has been tested for liquid

nitrogen at -196°C and liquid helium at -270°C with an accuracy of 12 pm/°C in a 70
m deep tank (Chen et al., 2012).

68

Figure 33. Schematic of fiber Rayleigh scattering method (Chen et al., 2012).

3.4.4 Acoustic wave

In literature there are several methods based on acoustic wave sensors or ultrasonic
level detection for cryogenic liquid measuring (Arpaia et al., 2018; Fisher & Malocha,

2007). However, the maximum pressure limitation is below 0.5 MPa due to
mechanical limitation of the sensor. The sensor can also not handle vacuum pressure
(van de Kamp, 2006) and for those reasons, it will not be investigated further.
3.4.5 Differential pressure
The pressure in liquid is proportional to density and height of the liquid. Pressure is
independent of volume and shape of the vessel. The reading by hydrostatic pressure at
a fixed point can be used to determine the depth of liquid in a tank, if the density is

known and the weight of the liquid above the fixed point is also known (Thipse, 2013).
However, hydrostatic pressure can only be measured at atmospheric pressure or above

in open vessels. In order to measure gauge or absolute pressure, a DP measurement is
used instead (van de Kamp, 2006).

The DP can be detected by sensing two pressures separately and by calculating the
difference, the liquid level is obtained. A pressure sensor based on piezoresistive
pressure method is shown in Figure 34.

69

Figure 34. Differential pressure measuring level sensor for cryogenic use: (1) electrical contact, (2) drainage
pipe, (3) cover, (4) cantilever, (5) membrane, (6) housing (Maryamova et al., 2000)

In practice, a single pressure difference sensor should be used to avoid measurement
errors (Liptak, 2003). An example of level measuring using a single pressure
difference sensor can be seen in Figure 35.

Figure 35. Cryogenic liquid level measuring in vacuum-insulated tank. LP is low pressure side, HP is high
pressure side and LT is differential pressure level transmitter (Liptak, 2003).

The height range of the pressure sensor is large with a reasonable accuracy. They are

not sensitive to changes in conductivity or product composition but are sensitive to the
specific gravity of the liquid. The system is used to measure the pressure and the liquid

70

level can then be calculate in the tank. It is advantageous to measure the weight of the
liquid rather than the volume with this method. The system is easily assembled, the

sensors are reasonably accurate and easy to calibrate if the mounting position is taken

into consideration. The disadvantages of this method are the density of the liquid is
needed and it can be expensive. The accuracy of the measurement is dependent on the

quality of the LNG, which affects density. The density will affect the temperature,
therefore, the accuracy is lowered with each step of affection (van de Kamp, 2006).

As the pressure transducer must be exposed to the pressure it is usually mounted near
or at the bottom of the tank. If the sensor is mounted on extension nozzles or pipes, it

must be ensured that the LNG will not crystalize or congeal in the pipe. A second

transducer can be mounted to measure the vapor pressure on top of the liquid in the
tank (van de Kamp, 2006). The pressure above the liquid affects the pressure measured

at the bottom of the tank. To measure the true liquid level the tank, the top pressure
must be subtracted from the bottom pressure. A pressure tap must be placed at the top

and connected to the low side of the transmitter. The tank pressure is then equally
applied and then the DP is proportional to the liquid height multiplied by the liquid

specific gravity. The impulse line must be provided with a minimum of two elbows

and straight minimum lengths of 500 mm in three planes in order to allow for line
contraction. Otherwise, a spiral from the tube must be done to allow for contraction.
The total minimum line length is 2 m. The impulse line must also be uninsulated to

prevent the appearance of two-phase condition. The low-side transmitter piping will
remain empty if the gas does not condensate. This is a dry leg condition which is
required for DP level measuring. The range determination of the high and the low

threshold for the transmitter can be calculated. The high threshold is calculated by the

specific gravity of the liquid multiplied by the vertical length between minimum and
maximum desired level. For the low threshold the specific gravity is multiplied by the

vertical length between transmitter datum line and min level. The transmitter is ATEX
certified and the cost starts at €3,000 but can be higher. The associated system can be
just as expensive (Emerson Automation Solutions, 2017).

71

3.4.6 Weighing
Weighing the storage tank is an indirect level measuring method that can be used for

cryogenic liquid. However, this method relies on the density and with LNG varying in
density this becomes difficult. It also measures the weight, not the level, which requires

large mechanical equipment and is expensive (van de Kamp, 2006). Therefore, this
method is not investigated further.
3.4.7 Guided wave radar
Microwave technology utilizes either guided or impulse-echo method. The guided
method is preferred for its ability to measure a lower dielectric value, handling vapor

and has similar properties as a superconductive sensor (Liptak, 2003; van de Kamp,
2006).

Radar uses time domain reflectometry technology to detect and measure liquid levels
in a tank. The radar is composed of an electric transmitter and a wave guide or a probe.

A high frequency with a low amplitude pulse is sent through the probe which is
immersed in the liquid. The probe impedance decreases when it reaches the liquid with
the higher dielectric constant than of air or vapor and the pulse is reflected. The
reflected pulse amplitude is then sampled and displayed on a time scale. Therefore,
with the samples and the interval time, the liquid level can be measured (Liptak, 2003).
This is shown in Figure 36.

72

Figure 36. Guided wave radar level measurement set-up (Liptak, 2003).

The minimum dielectric constant for the measurement range is 1.4 but can be lower

with special techniques. It can perform measurements at cryogenic temperature and

vacuum pressures with an accuracy of 0.3 mm or 0.1% depending on which is higher.

The operating tank depth can be from 0.7 to 60 m. The selection of the probe is the
important aspect when deciding the radar to be used. The process conditions, dielectric
sensitivity, mounting, probe length, turbulence, and hazardous area classification must

all be considered. An important aspect is overfilling prevention in the tank. By only

measuring at the top of the tank can be problematic and cause errors in the
measurement. This is because of the risk of false reflection if the probe meets
something other than the liquid and the distance to the liquid affects the accuracy.
Therefore, it can be useful to have another measurement system or another radar which
specifically detects high level alarm. The mounting of a radar is easy and usually it is

calibrated at the factory. The radar can be used with any communication protocol
(Liptak, 2003; van de Kamp, 2006).

The instrument is mounted via a standard pipe, mounting boss, or flange. To prevent

deflection of the probe on to the sides of the tank, nozzle, or external coupling, the
solid pin at the start of the cable must project into the tank and the nozzle diameter
should be at least as wide as high. To avoid false impedance changes, the measurement

range of the cable must be a minimum of 30 cm from the wall and other objects in the
tank. This also applies to the filling streams of LNG. If the cable can be moved by the

73

medium causing the probe to touch the side of the wall, the end of the probe can be
tied down (van de Kamp, 2006). The price on this instrument varies but is
approximately €3,400 and is ATEX certified (Emerson Automation Solutions, 2019).
3.4.8 Radiometric
This method is the only existing non-invasive level detection method. It should only

be used if the transducers cannot be applicable to a tank because of extreme process

or environment conditions (van de Kamp, 2006). Therefore, this method is not
investigated further.
3.5

Mass flow measurement

Mass flow measurement can be obtained as an indirect measurement of the mass flow

or as the product of volumetric flow and density in the process (Liptak, 2003). The

mass flow of a cryogenic fluid is important for CT from the tank or the truck to the
customer (Radebaugh, 2016). Mass is independent of pressure, temperature, density,

and viscosity (Basu, 2019e). As mass is an intrinsic property, it is always better to

measure mass flows in industrial processes but the volume flow measurement is also
popular (Basu, 2019b). Mass flow measurement is deployed for critical flow
applications. The reliability and the performance of the mass flow meter is important.
Since mass can only be measure indirectly is it necessary to accelerate the fluid to
measure the inertia effects (Basu, 2019e).

As the Coriolis flow meter is the only type of mass flow measurement allowed for CT

of LNG (Basu, 2019a), the other measurements will only be mentioned briefly and are
capacitive, microwave, optical, virtual, angular momentum, thermal or calorimetric,

hot-wire anemometer, and dual turbine flow meter (Arpaia et al., 2018; Basu, 2019e;
Radebaugh, 2016).

The capacitive flow meter measure electrical charges that appears when a liquid comes
in touch of a solid, creating a charge separation area. This can be utilized for slush

hydrogen but since slush is not appearing in LNG processes, this method cannot be

74

used (Arpaia et al., 2018).
The microwave flow meter consists of two circular waveguides placed upstream and
downstream of a flow pipe. The cut-off frequency of the waveguide changes with the
density of the liquid that flows. By knowing the distance between the two waveguides

and measuring the time between the cut-off frequency, the flow velocity is estimated.

The densimeter exploits the shift of a microwave due to variations of the dielectric

constant of a fluid. By using a network analyzer, the fluid density can be estimated.
This is used for slush hydrogen (Arpaia et al., 2018).

Optical techniques can be used to measure the direction and the speed of a fluid. By
using optical absorption and acoustic-optic signal processing, the mass flow rate can

be determined for the fluid. This is used to measure the mass flow of the propellant for
a rocket (Arpaia et al., 2018).

A virtual flow meter is an indirect measurement which combines data sensed by a

group of sensors. It calculates the mass flow of the fluid indirectly by using
temperature and pressure at the input/output of a valve. This has been used to monitor
and control cryogenic superconducting operations using hydrogen as a fluid (Arpaia
et al., 2018).

An angular momentum flow meter uses a rotating member with vanes which are

parallel to the axis. The rotating member is powered by an electric motor. The liquid
retards to the rotational speed, and the rotor speed sensed by a magnetic pickup is
treated electronically to indicate the mass flow rate. The maximum flow rate is

between 2 – 15 kg/s and has a pressure drop between 20 – 50 kPa. Liquid hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, and argon have been tested with this type of flow meter (Radebaugh,
2016).

In a thermal or a calorimetric flow meter, the fluid is heated with a constant power

which causes the fluid temperature to increase. A TC measures the temperature
difference of in- and outgoing fluid. The mass flow can be calculated when the specific

heat of the fluid is known. This has been tested for hydrogen and helium in its gas

75

phase at temperatures between -173 and 27°C at a low mass flow rate (Radebaugh,
2016).

A hot-wire anemometer deduces the mass flow rate from the heat transfer rates

associated with a heated element. The resistively heated element has a large
temperature coefficient of resistance and a large length-to-diameter ratio. The

electrical power to the element varies as the element maintains a constant resistance

and therefore the flow rate can be deduced from the voltage squared. This has been
tested for helium gas at temperatures down to -196°C (Radebaugh, 2016).

Dual turbine flow meters are used for cryogenic service (Radebaugh, 2016) but are not
popular outside of aerospace industry. This meter includes two closely coupled rotors

which can operate in the same or the opposite direction. As the fluid swirls the rotor
speeds can be sensed. The sum or the average speed can be used to estimate flow rate.
This can be utilized for liquids and gases down to -200°C (Basu, 2019d).
3.5.1 Coriolis
The Coriolis mass flow meter (CMFM) is the most popular mass flow measurement

for processes and utilizes the Coriolis effect. The liquid passes through a set of tubes,
which are vibrating at a natural frequency to minimize energy requirements. The use
of two tubes are the common practice, but the same result is achieved with only one

tube. However, for a higher sensitivity and to facilitate the measurement, two tubes
are required. The liquid flow enters U-shaped tubes and is returned to the main flow

process after passing it (Figure 37). The U-tubes will vibrate and when no flow is
present, the Coriolis force will be zero, as liquid starts to flow it will try to oppose the
vibrations (Basu, 2019b).

76

Figure 37. CMFM with main parts (Basu, 2019b)

The directions of the flow will be opposite at the inlet and the outlet. The inlet section

will decelerate the movement of the vibrations and the outlet section will accelerate

the movement. A phase shift will be introduced, meaning there will be a difference in

time of the peak for the vibrations which is proportional to the mass flow (Figure 38).

The sensor measures the motion of the flow tubes either by position, velocity, or

acceleration. The time lag is measured with an electromagnetic pick off to calculate
the mass flow (Basu, 2019b).

Figure 38. Flow direction of liquid in U-tubes and ΔT of inlet and outlet to measure mass flow (Basu, 2019b)

The main components of CMFM are as follows: meter body, connection flange, flow
splitter, flow tubes, casing enclosing flow tube, drive coil and magnet, sensors, and

transmitters. The typical CMFM is designed according to the twin-tube principle with

flow splitter and tow bent meter tubes. This allows for symmetry and is unaffected by

77

process parameters such as density, viscosity, and temperature. CMFM is an inline
type meter. Vibrations will not affect the measurement or the meter housing. The flow

splitter should split the flow equally. If not, the sensors located at both ends of the flow
tubes will measure the displacement, so additional errors will not occur. Therefore, the

flow profile is not needed, and no straight length is required. The critical points for
selecting a CMFM are flow sensitivity, pressure loss, tube size, and frequency of
operation. The tubes should be as short as possible to decrease pressure loss and
minimize the space requirement (Basu, 2019e). Elasticity changes with change of
temperature and temperature compensation is needed (Basu, 2019f).

The CMFM is designed to handle pressure up to 2.5 MPa, temperatures down
to -200°C, ambient temperatures from -40 to 70°C with a relative humidity up to 95%.
Typical accuracy is 0.25% and is dependent on zero stability. Zero stability is an error
caused by that the Coriolis sensors will show an offset signal even when the true mass

flow is zero. Zero stability is also a function of turndown ratio, the higher turndown
ratio the lower accuracy but less pressure loss. Zero stability is specified for all CMFM.

The relationship between these can be seen in Table 8. Typical turndown is 20:1.
Transmitter can be placed remote or is an integral part of the design. The response time
is less than one second and can use all kinds of protocols (Basu, 2019e).
Table 8. Relationship amongst accuracy, turndown and pressure loss (Basu, 2019e)

The advantages with CMFM are as follows: direct measurement of true mass flow,

multivariable measurement, i.e., mass flow, density, and temperature with lower

amount of instruments, volume flow can be computed, used for all kinds of medium,

measuring flow in both directions, low power consumption, no moving parts, and no
straight length requirement. The disadvantages are as follows: capital cost, limited
sizes of the meter, affected by external parameters, and pressure drop. CMFM is used

for different types of applications (Basu, 2019e), but is specially used for CT of LNG
and for other cryogenic liquids (Basu, 2019a).

78

The measuring tube should be full when measuring the flow. The entrapment of gas
and build-up should be avoided. Both vertical and horizontal mounting is allowed.

Vertical mounting should be used for upward flow. This is preferred as it ensures a
complete fill up of the measuring tube. It also ensures that dirt is drained downwards,

and entrapped gas is released from the top. Downward flow is allowed if there is a
restricting orifice and valve downstream to ensure the line is full. Horizontal mounting

can be done head up, which is used for liquids, or head down, which is used for gas.
There should be isolation valves placed up and downstream of the CMFM for

maintenance or part replacement. A bypass line with a valve should be placed so that

the process line remains uneffaced if the meter is inoperative. The meter housing
should not be placed on a flange, and therefore, a short meter section is needed. The
CMFM should not be placed near valves with frequent ON/OFF functions as it will

cause pulsation and vibrations which will affect the performance. Piping should be
firmly connected to prevent additional vibrations. Calibration of the instrument is done
individually with water as the medium, which brings major uncertainty to other
cryogenics (Basu, 2019e). Calibration of any instrument for cryogenic use is difficult

as there are not many calibration facilities for cryogenics in the world. It is still
recommended to test the meter in an independent laboratory for precise measurement

(Basu, 2019f). The CMFM is designed to be used in hazardous areas. The cost of this

type of instrument starts at €8,500 and increases depending on application type and
additional functions (Instrumart, 2020b). Additional information regarding selection,
design, installation etc. can be found in ISO 21903.
3.6

Volumetric flow measurement

As mentioned in Chapter 3.5, volume flow measurement is popular in industrial

processes. It is possible to arrive at mass flow from volume flow by multiplying
measured volume flow with the density at the operating condition. Some limitations

to this approach are that correct fluid properties might not be obtainable. When
changing operating conditions, temperature and pressure compensation are applied.

Therefore, the mass flow computed from the volume flow will include all inaccuracies
of the overall measurement (Basu, 2019e).

79

To compute the volumetric flow, the common method is to measure the velocity of the

fluid inside the pipe and multiply the area of the pipe. The velocity profile of the fluid
is a function of pipe geometry and Reynolds number. There is also a straight pipe

length requirement for the flow meter which is required to achieve the required

accuracy. Typical values for liquid velocity are between 0.15 and 4 m/s. The flow
meter is typically fitted with flanges to be mounted to a pipe. Turbine and ultrasonic

flow meters can be used for CT of LNG. However, they must be approved by a notified

body and density of LNG must be established (Basu, 2019b, 2019a). Positive
displacement and vortex shedding can be used for LNG processes (Arpaia et al., 2018;
Radebaugh, 2016) and will therefore be mentioned briefly.

The positive displacement method uses a mechanical flow meter with moving parts.

Volume is directly measured and is independent of fluid velocity, pipe inside
diameters, and flow profiles. The mechanical moving parts located in the flow stream

will physically separate the fluid into known volumes based on the dimensions of the
meter. The known volume increments are counted or totalized (Basu, 2019b). They

are used for various cryogenic applications where there is a low flow rate between
3.6 – 36 m3/h (Radebaugh, 2016).

Vortex shedding in fluids occurs when placing a non-streamlined object in the path of

a fluid with a high Reynolds number. Intervals between the vortices are constant,

regardless of velocity, and the function of the diameter of the pipe. The fluid will

alternately separate from one side to the other downstream. A bluff body is a crosssectional shape that offers large resistance to incoming flow to retard it. On the bluff
body where the vortex shedding occurs, the fluid velocity increases, and the pressure
will decrease. On the opposite side, pressure will increase, and velocity will decrease.

This will cause a net pressure on the bluff body and will be reversed as the next vortex
is shed from the opposite side. This is known as Karman’s principle and is utilized for

vortex flow meters (Basu, 2019b). Vortex flow metering is suited for LNG
measurement with a low Reynolds number. However, this has yet to penetrate the

market (Basu, 2019h) as it is a comparatively modern flow measuring technology
(Basu, 2019d).

80

3.6.1 Turbine
The turbine flow meter (TFM) is an inferential measurement which calculates the

volumetric flow from temperature and pressure conditions (Basu, 2019d). It is used

for CT of low-viscosity fluids which can be applied for LNG (Basu, 2019a). The TFM
is used for a large variety of application areas for cryogenic liquids and gases (Basu,

2019d). The TFM is an instrument where the kinetic energy of a moving fluid is
converted into rotational energy (Basu, 2019d). The process fluid flowing against the
turbine causes the blades to rotate at a speed proportional to the velocity. An axially

mounted rotor with blades is assembled in the flow and supported by ball or sleeve

bearings on a shaft. This is found inside the TFM, as shown in Figure 39. As the liquid
passes through the blades, the rotator speeds up, and the flow rate can be sensed by the
magnetic pick-up. As the rotator blades pass the magnetic pick-up, a voltage pulse is
generated, and a totalized flow can be calculated by the total number of pulses (Basu,
2019b).

Figure 39. Turbine flow meter and working principle (Basu, 2019b).

The main parts of the TFM are the meter body, flanges for process connection,

threaded electrical connector, flow conditioner (up- and downstream), hanger blade

(up- and downstream), hanger hub, sharp upstream cone, rotor assembly, rotor
bearings, shaft, smoother downstream cone, and top electrical enclosure. It can handle

pressures up to 4.0 MPa (Basu, 2019d) and cryogenic temperatures down to -267°C
(Basu, 2019f). The operational temperature range is -20 to 70°C and a relative

humidity of 90% (Basu, 2019d). The accuracy rating is between 0.15 – 0.5% and can

81

handle a range ability larger than 10:1 (Basu, 2019b). Another important parameter is
the K-factor, the number of pulses per unit volume. This is dependent on the viscosity

and determined by the size of the TFM (Basu, 2019d), which can be from 5 to 700 mm
(Basu, 2019b).

The TFM is a well understood measurement method that is suitable for both gas and

liquid. The advantages are as follows: a wide operational envelope, inline or insertion
type of measurement, suitable for high pressures and low flow rates, an easy

installation method, and a wide design of the electrical enclosure for safety

applications and harsh environments. The disadvantages are as follows: high wear,

erosion and damages due to the moving parts which affects accuracy, the long straight
length requirement (U:10D/D:5D), viscosity changes of the liquid, and a robust pipe
system is needed. Any vibrations of the pipe system will cause distortion to the flow
profile and disturb the measurement. (Basu, 2019d)

For the installation of the TFM, the environmental considerations must be done

considered. The flow direction must be followed for the mounting and a flow
conditioner must be used. Shielded cables should be used and earthed. Excess torque

should be avoided for the installation. The tapping points should be placed in the outlet
section of the meter housing. For pressure tapping the distance is 3 x the nominal width

and for temperature tapping, 5 x the nominal width. A calibration of the instrument is
needed to fix the specific K-factor. The calibration of the TFM used for cryogenic
liquids is hard to achieve as a comparison method of calibration is the only option. The

instrument is compared with another type of flow measurement, which will increase

the probability of a higher uncertainty. Since the TFM has moving parts, frequent
calibration checks are needed. For more information regarding installation of TFM,

ISA – RP31.1 can be advised (Basu, 2019d). The cost of the TFM depends on the size

and additional applications. The starting price is €850 but can be up to €30,000 for the
instrument with installation costs (Universal Flow Monitors Inc., 2020).

82

3.6.2 Ultrasonic
The ultrasonic flow meter (USFM) utilizes electrical properties, ultrasonic energy in
the form of acoustic waves, to measure the flow rate. It is a noninvasive measurement

and there are three types of USFM: Doppler type, transit time type, and correlation

type (Basu, 2019d). The transit time type is used for cryogenic applications (Basu,
2019f). There are two configurations of transit time USFM as can be seen in Figure

40. In the first version, transducers are placed on opposite sides of the pipe and the
transit time from transmitter to receiver, both with and against the flow direction, is
measured to compute fluid velocity. In the second version, the transducers are placed
on the same side of the pipe and the transit time is measured from one transducer and
reflected from the pipe and returned to the receiver (Basu, 2019b).

Figure 40. Transit time ultrasonic flow meter (A) different side configuration, (B) same side configuration (Basu,
2019b).

The transit time of the USFM depends on the velocity of the ultrasonic and of the
flowing liquid. The flow measurement is affected by flow profile, pipe influence,
environmental interference, and temperature of the fluid. The USFM consists of a set

of transducers, an electrical housing, a pipe section, and/or a spool piece. The pipe
section in this case means clamp type mounting. The liquid is needed for the acoustic

waves to travel, therefore, the density, pressure, and temperature must be defined
(Basu, 2019d).

The transducer can fit into the spool piece and be welded with the pipe or it can have
a flanged type connection. The transducer is the main part of the instrument. It includes

83

piezoelectric technology which vibrates when a current is applied. The transducer can
be wetted or non-wetted. A wetted transducer is an invasive but non-intrusive method.
It is shaped flat and comes in sizes of 1 to 30 cm in diameter. The connection type is

a tilted diameter where the transmitter is on opposite side of the pipe or in an axial
offset on the same side. The minimum diameter for the tilted diameter of the pipe is

50 mm and for axial offset, smaller pipes are used in sizes of 6 to 50 mm. A non-wetted

transducer includes a clamped connection and is mounted outside on the pipe. The

non-wetted method is non-invasive and used for pipe sizes above 50 mm. For smaller
pipes, the transducer must be preinstalled. The location of the transducer is important

for the accuracy and for the measurement to take place. A straight pipe is required,

10D upstream and 5D downstream in order to achieve an undisturbed flow profile. If
a flow conditioner is used, the requirement is less strict. Transducers should be located

horizontally with the pipe. It cannot be mounted at the top or bottom for horizontal
pipes. This is because if there is entrapped gas at the top or containments of the liquid

in the bottom the measurement will be affected. If the pipe is full, mounting on vertical

pipes is allowed but downward flow should be avoided. Pressure and temperature

tapings should be mounted downstream. The recommended location for the
temperature probe is 3D from the flow meter (Basu, 2019d). Calibration for the
instrument was not found for cryogenic liquids but it is assumed that it is like other
types of cryogenic flow measurement.

The advantages are as follows: the larger the size of the USFM and pipes will result in
a higher accuracy of the measurement, miniscule pressure loss due to the non-intrusive

measurement, no moving parts, high overall accuracy, reliable, easy installation, both

weld-on and pipe clamp type connection can be used, low maintenance, and low power
consumption. The disadvantages are the cost compared to other flow meters,
measurement according to the full hose philosophy only, and the measurement is
affected by flow profile, deposits, or the entrapment of gas or dirt (Basu, 2019d).

The USFM is used for a large variety of liquids and gases (Basu, 2019d). It can be
used for CT applications for larger quantities of NG and LNG (Basu, 2019d;

Hogendoorn et al., 2007). It can handle ambient temperatures of -40 to 70°C and

relative humidity of 95%. It has an accuracy between the range of 0.5 to 2%, the

84

operating temperature range is between -200 to 80°C. It is independent of pressure and
can therefore handle a high pressure. This type instrument is suitable for use in

hazardous environments (Basu, 2019d). Various suppliers can be found for this
instrument but no available cost of the USFM has been found. For information related
to installation and selection of USFM, ISO 21903 can be advised.
3.7

Differential Pressure flow measurement

Flow rates based on a non-flow measurement is used by inferential flow meters. It is

accepted for measuring gas or liquid flows. All DP flow measurements are static and

have no moving parts. In head type flow measurement, a differential head is created
with the help of a restriction which can be measured. The principle of the measurement

is based on the pressure drop across the restriction which is proportional to the square
of flow rate. The flow rate is calculated by extracting the square root of the reading

(Basu, 2019b). The orifice plate measurement is the only one allowed for CT but for
NG only. It is however a common method used to measure the flow of LNG (Basu,
2019a).

A venturi is a gradual tapered restriction at the inlet and outlet, referred to as the throat.

It has a very high discharge coefficient and low pressure drop. The convergence and

throat area is responsible for the pressure drop and is where the head type flow is
calculated (Basu, 2019b). The venturi has been used for helium. Its design prevent it

from being used in reverse flow, which is a possibility with the orifice plate
(Radebaugh, 2016).

A laminar flow element creates a linear relationship between the mass flow rate and

the pressure drop. This can be used for a wider range of flow rates compared to the
orifice plate and the venturi. However, this is not commercially available and only
used in laboratory environments (Radebaugh, 2016).
3.7.1 Orifice plate
The orifice plate is the most used fluid flow element in processes. An orifice inserted
into a pipeline causes an increase in velocity and a corresponding decrease of pressure

85

will occur downstream. The Vena contracta is the location in the orifice where this
occurs and where the diameter of the stream is the smallest. An orifice plate is a flat
piece of metal with a specified sized hole (Basu, 2019b) as shown in Figure 41.

Figure 41. Orifice plate inlet pipe with standard orifice and conditioning orifice – adapted from (Basu, 2019b)

Orifice assembly includes the orifice plate, a flange or carrier ring, gasket, pressure

tapping, studs and nuts as shown in Figure 42. It offers acceptable uncertainties at
comparatively low costs. There are mainly four types of orifice plates: the measuring,

integral, senior, and restriction. Depending on the pipe size, the thickness of the orifice
plate changes. An orifice plate based on Bernoulli’s theory is referred to as a
conditioning orifice plate (Basu, 2019c). This is an integral orifice plate and used for

cryogenic measurements (Basu, 2019f). There are some deviations from with the

conditioning office compared to the standard orifice plate. These deviations are the
plate thickness, orifice/beta ratio, piping requirements, and the accuracy.

The advantages of the conditioning orifice compared to the standard orifice are as
follow: the self-conditioning flow which increases the performance, short straight pipe

requirement (U:2D/D:2D), tight fit application, and improved wet gas applications
allowing condensate to pass. It has a compact design which includes a transmitter for

a higher accuracy and lower installation costs. A conditioning orifice plate includes
four holes placed in a pattern, as can be seen in Figure 41. This design will make the

86

fluid flow condition itself. It is designed to have the same beta ratio or the equivalent
to a standard orifice (Basu, 2019c).

Figure 42. Orifice flange assembly and carrier ring with flange tapping - adapted from (Basu, 2019c)

The advantages of using an orifice plate compared to other flow meters are as follow:

no moving parts, robust construction, available in a wide variety of size and beta ratio.
It is inexpensive and the cost is similar for all sizes. It is easy to design, manufacture,

install, and require low maintenance (Basu, 2019c). The disadvantage is a permanent

pressure loss and therefore has a higher power requirement. The accuracy is at best 2%

which is affected by the density, the pressure, and the viscosity (Crabtree, 2009).
Measurement errors due to density variations will affect the differential pressure ratio

and should be less than 0.25 (Liptak, 2003). This instrument is not suitable for
measurement where Reynolds number is < 10.000. The size of the vent and drain hole

should be < 10% of orifice diameter, otherwise corrections of the flow calculation are
needed. Head type meters with connection to a DPT through an impulse line have
multiple leakage points (Basu, 2019c). Large temperature gradients present concerns

when O-rings, glands, welds, or dissimilar metals are present in the ﬂow stream (Basu,
2019f).

The suggested pressure range is 0 – 25 kPa for maximum accuracy but the range can

be up to 10 MPa. It has an range ability of 5:1 and the accuracy is 2 – 4% over full
scale (Basu, 2019b). The design, including the transmitter, can handle fluids with
temperature at the boiling point of -196°C (Basu, 2019f). The conditioning orifice

87

utilize a smart multivariable transmitter which can measure absolute pressure, DP, and

temperature (Basu, 2019g). For high accuracy flow measurement, in smaller pipe
sizes, a meter run assembly design is common. This assembly is built as one unit to
avoid inaccuracies. For high pressure applications, a raised face or ring type flange

connection is used for mounting to the pipeline (Basu, 2019c). The starting price for

the orifice plate flow meter is around €3,000 and upwards, depending on the
application and process connection (Instrumart, 2020a).

Tapping points must be placed for measuring. There are five types of tapping styles
which are corner, flange, radius, vena contracta and pipe tap. Corner and flange

tapping are the most common practice in Europe. The corner taps are located
immediately adjacent to the plate faces, between the plate and the pipe wall. Flange

tap design places the tap holes every 25 mm upstream and downstream of the orifice
plate. The basic mounting steps for the orifice plate are as follows: confirming the

placement of the orifice in the pipe, assure proper orientation, measure the inside
diameter at the tapping point, welding the orifice assembly flange connection to the

pipe, ensure that cleaning, draining, and purging are applicable, ensure the pipe is

unpressurized and purged, and lastly check for leaks (Basu, 2019c). For DPT to
measure the process conditions, impulse lines must be installed. The line can be either
an impulse tube or pipe, where the tube is the preferred option as it is cheaper. There

is also no need for screws and welding. The DPT is placed above or below the source

point. All transmitters are connected to an impulse line via a valve manifold which has

a three- or five-valve manifold connection (Basu, 2019c), as can be seen in Figure 43.

88

Figure 43. Valve manifold with DPT and impulse line set-up – adapted from (Basu, 2019c)

For liquid measurement, it is common for vapor and dirt to be entrapped and
accumulated in the liquid. To avoid this, tapping should be done from the horizontal

side of the pipe, so vapor vents up and dirt flows down. If this is not applicable, then
the tapping point should be 45° to the horizontal on either side. This is only valid for

horizontal pipes. The transmitter location should be below the source point, so a higher
positive head is available and entrapped vapor is released towards the pipe. If the
transmitter must be placed above the source point, the impulse line should be at an
elevation slightly above the transmitter level and then make a downward loop

connection to the transmitter. The impulse line should be as short as possible. The
impulse line is upward or downward depending on the case but should be at a slope of
a 2/25 gradient (Basu, 2019c).

There is a lack of calibrating equipment for operations at cryogenic temperatures. The
calibration is done at room temperature and afterwards, calculations are made by

extrapolating cryogenic conditions from readings at room temperatures. For a
complete understanding of pressure tapping, design, placement, installation etc. for the

orifice plate, EN ISO 5167-1 & -2 can be used. ISO 2186 can be used for impulse lines
(Basu, 2019c).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

This chapter focuses on explaining the work process and the critical instruments. It
also analyzes the requirements for the instruments, investigates the available

measuring methods, the accuracy requirements for the instruments, and the findings of
the thesis.
4.1

Reviewing the standard pressurized LNG satellite terminal

The standard pressurized LNG satellite terminal was reviewed to see which types of

instruments it contains. This was required in order to analyze the need for instruments.
This was done by reading the P&IDs and process descriptions for the process modules.

From the P&IDs, the process line and the main equipment were established as well as

the type of measurement and the location of the instrument. Based on this, a list of

each module was created, including instrument name, type, model number,
manufacturer, enclosure protection, atmosphere protection, design range, operating
range, process connection, description of location, I/O-type, control system
connection, types of signal, and if it is a critical instrument. All attributes are important

in order to understand the logic of the selection and to get a complete picture of the

instruments used for the process. From the process description, the procedure of the
process was established. By establishing the step by step of the LNG process, the logic
of the process and the measured values were determined.

Firstly, a critical instrument in this thesis is defined as an instrument that is not working

as intended. Secondly, another solution would be preferred to the existing one. Thirdly,
the instrument should be upgraded to present better results in a more cost-effective
way regarding purchase and installation costs.

After the lists were created, a summary of the types and total amount of instruments

was established for each module. Detailed information was investigated by reviewing
technical specifications and data sheets of the instruments used for the modules. The

parameters for the standard pressurized LNG satellite terminal were done during this
time as well.

4.2

Critical instruments

A discussion with Mr. Krooks and Mr. Latvasalo was held to determine if an

instrument was critical or not. Eight instruments were deemed critical out of all the

instruments used for the modules. Most of the critical instruments were related to
temperature measurement. The other instruments were related to level and flow
measuring. This discussion was helpful as it gave insight into questions not considered

earlier and guidance in order to find related information to certain instruments. It also

gave a wider perspective for the search information on analyzing the real need for
instruments.
4.3

Analyzing the need for instruments

After reviewing all the instruments used for the modules, it was time to understand the
usage and the need. Initially, this was discussed with Mr. Krooks. The process design

and instruments used were based upon HAZOP, the knowledge of design engineers,

and common practice within the industry. It was decided that deeper and broader
background knowledge was to be investigated. This was done by reading standards for
design of onshore LNG facilities.

EN 1473:2019 is the standard used for LNG onshore installations. Within this standard
there are additional standards that can be read and interpreted for design. By using the
internal engineering workbench and with the help of Mr. Krooks, additional standards

were found to include valuable information. Unfortunately, not all interesting or
relatable standards to instrumentation or process design were accessible.

In the beginning, only information related to instruments of LNG process was searched

for. Information related to the installation and the design specific for LNG process

were also included with time. With the help of the determined critical components,
additional information such as custody transfer, MID certification, and specifications

related to control system were added. Open access information not part of standards

was also searched for. However, all the information found referred to the standards. A
list of requirements was created. The list includes all information found for

instrumentation, installation, and process design. The list of requirements is meant to

91

be used to analyze the real need for the instruments. The list of requirements is
presented as Chapter 2.6 and the standards used can be found in Chapter 5.5.
4.4

Measuring methods for process variables

It was now time to find instruments and methods that can be used for monitoring LNG

processes. The focus was originally on new methods or instruments. Theoretically,
new methods can include measurements that can be applied to LNG processes.

Therefore, all measurements applicable for cryogenic conditions and liquids were
included as well, since the operating conditions for cryogenic liquids are similar.

Unfortunately, this is not always possible in practice as certain conditions or
parameters are related to a specific liquid. The method or instrument was investigated

if it can be used for cryogenic conditions. The methods mentioned in this thesis are all

used for cryogenic measurement. However, certain methods are only mentioned

briefly as they are not applicable for LNG (e.g., capacitive flow meter) which needs to
be in contact with a solid to create a charge in order to measure the flow rate.

The materials used for cryogenic instruments in this thesis are obtained from different

sources, including distinguished papers and articles published by research institutions

and handbooks for cryogenics, LNG and other measurements. The instrument or
method is validated by extensive use in the process industry or by the academic

research of institutions. The methods mentioned are either available for commercial

use, for use in laboratory environments or experimental set-ups. Most of the methods
are available for commercial use. The mentioning of methods used in laboratory

environments or experimental set-ups are important. As technology improves, certain
methods might be applicable in the future for use in the industry.

To have a clear list of technical specifications and attributes was important in order to

compare the methods that were discovered. This is to determine if a method is more
valuable than the other methods. The technical specification is important as it relates

to the instrumentation being applicable with the operating conditions. The accuracy of
the instrument is equally important due to the readings of the variables. This is to

ensure a safe operation of the process controlled by the system. The advantages and

92

disadvantages are great for understanding the instrument and if it is applicable or
deviates from the design of the process. The installation method of the instrument is
needed in order to know how to integrate the instrument and additional equipment with

the process. The cost of the installation is also needed. E.g., is it enough to have a

transmitter mounted with a pipe clamp or must it be welded with a pocket into the

pipe? The kind of information and attributes can make or break the selection of an
instrument. Certain attributes can lead to more problems such as, a pipe clamp is
cheaper than a welded pocket. Will the accuracy still be the same? These are
considerations that are important and therefore must be included.
4.5

Accuracy

The accuracy for meters and measuring systems for MID certification and CT, can be
seen in Table 9. A meter is an instrument designed to measure continuously, memorize

and display the quantity at metering conditions of the flowing liquid. A calculator is a
part of the meter that receives the output signals from the measurement transducers,
the associated measuring instruments, and displays the result. The associated

measuring instrument is connected to the calculator for measuring certain quantities
which are characteristic of the liquid. The measuring system includes the meter and all

the devices required to ensure correct measurement (The European Parliament and the
Council, 2014).

The accuracy for liquid level measurement in a storage tank has not been established.

General agreement for instruments and methods for CT in LNG carrier’s tanks is ± 5.0

mm or better (GIIGNL, 2015). This agreement is based upon information found in the

93

ISO 18132-1:2011 standard, which is used for carriers and floating storage. The ISO
18132-2:2009 has been found. This standard refers to refrigerated shore tanks for

hydrocarbon fluids and could include information regarding the accuracy for liquid
measurement in storage tanks. However, the standard has not been found accessible.

For the NG side in an LNG facility, the accuracy shall be better than 2% and the
repeatability better than 0.6% on full scale. This applies to an ambient temperature
between -20 to 40°C (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization,
2009).
4.6

Establishing and finalizing instruments

All the methods applicable for LNG monitoring and a comparison between them, are
summarized in Chapters 5.1 – 5.4. The creation of a procedure to select an instrument
to be used has been discussed. This would be in the form of a logical thought process.
The procedure includes the requirements related to the instrument such as operating

conditions, technical information, availability, safety regulations, and certificates. The
information needs to be compared to the technical data sheet of an instrument from the

supplier. An example of how this procedure would look like can be seen in Figure 44.

monitoring (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, 2014a).

RESULTS

The results of this thesis are meant to give process design engineers a better

understanding of measuring instruments used in an LNG process. In the following
subchapters, the results presented are as follows: a comparison of the instruments

based on their attributes and recommendations of which instrument to be used,
international standards that will help with the design of LNG processes and instrument

specifications, the results of the critical instruments and finalized instrumentation
specifications according to findings.
5.1

Pressure measuring methods

A comparison in terms of accuracy, measurement range, operating temperature,
influence quantities, and commercial availability among the described pressure

sensors are reported in Table 10. The inductive method is interesting because of its
high accuracy and wide operating temperature, but neither it nor capacitive
measurements can be used for cryogenic measurement since these are not
commercially available.

Based on the information in Chapter 3.2, the piezoresistive pressure sensor exhibits

the best use for cryogenic measurement due to it having the largest operational range
with a high accuracy. Its small size, low power consumption and commercial

availability makes this sensor an attractive choice and the clear favorite for LNG

pressure monitoring. It is SIL certified which is important. It is favorable in price
compared to the other methods. The installation method is the same as for the

95

piezoelectric, but the accuracy is superior, and it is cheaper. It is also the most common
type of pressure sensor. It is available in a wide variety of different specifications and
finding the right type is likely due to the great number of suppliers.

For measurement of NG, the piezoresistive sensor is recommended as well but there
is also the possibility of using a reluctance pressure transducer. The piezoresistive

sensor is still preferred since it has a higher accuracy. It is difficult to compare these

two, since no price was found for the reluctance pressure transducer. Depending on
the type of LNG process it might be worth to have less accuracy for a cheaper
measurement system.
5.2

Temperature measuring methods

Six methods for measuring cryogenic temperature were discovered but only four are

redeemed as viable for LNG processes. The semiconductor-like resistance

thermometer is decided not suitable for LNG since its preferred temperature range is
far below the boiling point of LNG. The capacitance thermometer is also decided to
not be used. This is because of the lack of a strong presence of magnetic fields in LNG
processes, which is the atmosphere where these thermometers thrive.

The remaining four methods are compared in Table 11. The FBG sensor is an

interesting solution for temperature monitoring in the LNG storage tank as it performs
like an RTD. However, the accuracy is not as great as for the other measurements.

There are also unknown factors regarding the safety and since it is not commercially

available, one can only wait for the future to know if it will stay as an experimental
set-up.

The diode thermometer can be cheaper than the RTD and the TC but is still not
recommended because of the inferior accuracy. The set-up may be expensive and with

the current accuracy it still might not be suitable compared to the other measuring

instruments. It is also not suited in LNG facilities from a safety perspective, as no
information has been found regarding it.

The RTD is more accurate and stable while the TC is more economical. They are both

interchangeable with each other, if one method is used then the other could be used as
a replacement. They have a similar installation method as well as the mounting of the
sensor. In the end, the deciding factors are accuracy, safety, reproducibility,
temperature range, resolution, size, cost, magnetic field, and measuring instrument.

Based on these factors the RTD is the favorite choice for temperature measurement in
LNG processes. The use of the RTD is also the common practice for LNG processes

and the TC is more suited for experimental set-up or laboratory environments where
safety is not of the greatest concern and where less accuracy is enough.

The thermometer probe of the RTD or the TC can be placed in a thermowell or a pipe

clamp. If the measurement is intrusive a thermowell must be used to protect the probe
from the environment. Thermal insulation must be used to reduce heat losses due to

the intrusive installation method. A pipe clamp or welded pocket can be used for noninvasive and non-intrusive measurement. The difference between them is that pipe
clamp is cheaper than the welding cost and a thermowell is the most expensive method.

The accuracy will be higher for an intrusive measurement, but the reliability will be

lower due to risk of leakage. The accuracy for a non-intrusive measurement is between
1 – 2% but will be more reliable.
5.3

Level measuring methods

Out of the eight level measuring methods mentioned earlier only five remain. Acoustic
wave, weighing, and radiometric level detection were deemed not applicable for the

process conditions. The remaining five methods can be seen in Table 12 where their
accuracy, measurement range, operating temperature, and influence quantities are
compared.

Optical fiber sensors with self-heated fibers such as FBG sensors appear to be a good
choice for cryogenic storage application. This is based on the technical specification

in Table 12. It has been specifically designed to reduce safety concerns that are present

in current level measuring methods and to be applicable in ATEX. However, it is not
available for the LNG industry yet but the research investigating the method confirms

the possibility of working in storage applications. Hopefully, this method will be
available for commercial use in the future. If the cost is reasonable, this can be a viable
option for future storage applications.

Capacitance and superconductive level sensors are used for cryogenic liquids, but no
evidence on them being used for LNG have been found. The guided wave radar senses

the dielectric constant of LNG in order to measure the liquid level. The use of this
method has increased in recent years for monitoring the storage tank. However, there

are some issues that can occur with radar and a separate high-level alarm might be
needed to prevent overfilling the tank as seen in Figure 30.

The first consideration when it comes to level measurement in a tank is usually DP
measuring. It is accurate, reliable and can be modified depending on the service

needed. The downside of this is the handling of the low-pressure side. Depending on
the ambient temperature change, the density will change, and the level reading can
become inaccurate.

98

The best decision for level measurement is between guided wave radar and DP

measuring. The DP measuring is used in a wider range of tank storage than radar, but
they have similar technical specifications. The price of the instruments is similar, and

both are designed according to safety recommendations. The installation of the guided

wave radar is straight forward compared to DP measurement. However, there are
challenges when installing a radar in a vacuum insulated tank. A chamber should be

used to prevent disturbances and to isolate the measurement. The DP measurement
must heed to stricter installation requirements than guided wave radar (e.g., placement

of the transmitter, impulse line length, slopes, and uninsulated pipes) in order to
achieve correct measurement of the liquid level. Accuracy related problems appear

when the impulse line cannot ensure if the measurement is on gas or liquid phase. If

the measurement must be independent of density, then radar is the clear choice.
Otherwise, the choice is not that clear between which measurement is better. A lot
comes down to what kind of information is known regarding the selected level

measurement and what are the recommendations from the manufacturer side. Other
than that, it comes down to the cost of the measuring system and the general design of
the storage tank.
5.4

Flow measuring methods

The flow measuring methods CMFM, TFM, USFM, and conditioning orifice are found
in Table 13. There their accuracy, influence quantities, straight length requirement,

operating pressure, and operating temperature are compared. All methods are viable
for flow measurement of LNG, while the orifice plate is not applicable for CT of LNG.
If CT of LNG is required, the Coriolis flow meter is the best choice. All flow meters

must be approved by a notified body to be used for CT. It has the highest accuracy and

is applicable for the process conditions. It is a cheaper choice compared to the other

flow instruments. It has no straight length requirement and less requirements for
installation in general. The TFM and the USFM require additional density
measurement. They can be used for CT but may have to meet additional requirements

or is approved with remarks. The TFM has moving parts which is not preferred for CT
as this affects the reliability of the process. It also cannot compete with the other

99

instruments when it comes to the lower side of ambient temperature. There are more

requirements for the installation of the TFM and the USFM compared to Coriolis flow
meter. The list of order for CT of LNG flow meter is Coriolis, USFM, and TFM. All
meters can be found in various sizes for different pipe sizes. However, if large
quantities are to be measured, the USFM is the preferred option. This is because the

larger the pipe diameter, the more time for the traversing of the beam and hence a

higher accuracy on the measurement. It can also be more cost-effective for the larger
pipe size.

If the meter is meant to only be used for LNG measurement, the same list of order is
applied but the conditioning orifice must be included in the list. The main disadvantage

with the conditioning orifice compared to the other flow meters is the accuracy.

However, it is considerable cheaper compared to the other methods. In terms of size

all are applicable for placement in a module, except for USFM which tend to be larger
in size. All meters have their downside and careful consideration should be placed to

the specific design conditions. Either Coriolis or conditioning orifice is recommended
for LNG measurement. It all comes down to the accuracy specification, the design of

the process, and the cost of the total design. Even if conditioning orifice is cheaper
than Coriolis as an instrument, the total installation cost should be considered as well.
If the best accuracy is required than Coriolis is the clear favorite.

Standards

In Table 14, the standards used in the thesis can be seen. These standards need to be

taken into consideration when designing an LNG facility. The standards for the
instrumentation and the control system are included as well. Limited or no

Critical instruments and finalizing specifications

During the writing of the thesis, most of the issues related to critical instrument have

been answered. The critical instruments were a better solution would be preferred has
been presented. Questions related to the critical instruments were answered with the

help of standards and information that can be found in this thesis. However, for one of
the critical instruments an answer has not yet been found at this point. The problem

with the critical instrument cannot be answered with just information regarding the

instrument, but the equipment in the process must also be considered. In order to move
further, more information is required. The answers to questions and suggested

instruments for the critical instruments found were written in a separate document and
will not be presented publicly in this thesis. The finalizing of instrumentation

specifications according to findings can be found as the standards for LNG design in
Chapter 2.6.

DISCUSSION

The measuring instruments presented in the results are all applicable for the monitoring
of LNG processes. Not all the measurements are available for the industry as certain

instruments are only reported for use in laboratory environments. Generally, the

preferred instrument type presented for monitoring the process variable complies with
what is used in the industry today.

For monitoring pressure, the piezoresistive sensor is the best option. This is the case

for the LNG industry. It is the most common method with a high accuracy and a low
price compared to other available pressure instruments. It would be great to see more

research added into the inductive pressure measuring method. The research articles on

the method present a promising solution for the cryogenic process industry. It is a
simple method of measurement capable of handling cryogenic temperatures with an
accuracy greater than piezoresistive sensors.

The selection of the temperature instrument comes down between the RTD and the

TC. This is not surprising as both are common temperature instruments. They are in
extensive use within cryogenic processes. They have similar attributes and installation
methods, resulting in them being easily interchanged for temperature measurement.
The selection comes down to the total cost of the measurement and the installation if
the manufacturer provides the needed safety certifications.

The only new instrument discovered for cryogenic temperature measurement was FBG

sensors. The accuracy is slightly lower than the accuracy of the RTD and the TC. It
presents itself as a unique measurement utilizing optical technology. It is specifically

designed for LNG storage monitoring from a safety perspective. It has only been tested
for liquid nitrogen with successful results. It is a new instrument which is currently
being developed. Hopefully more research and technical information will be accessible
in the future. This can be a future temperature method for commercial use.

For liquid level measurement in cryogenic conditions, there are two given options, DP
measurement or radar. This is not a surprise as has been the case with the other

measurements. DP measurement has always been a common solution to establish the
liquid level in a tank. The use of guided wave radar has increased over the years. They

104

utilize completely different measurement methods, where the guided wave radar
measures the actual liquid level and the DP measurement is used to calculate the liquid

level if installed accordingly. There are certain scenarios where one method is
preferred. Both methods have their own related issues. The decision comes down to

the total cost of the package. With the increase of guided radar used for liquid
measurement, it is worth to request quotations from manufactures.

Optical technology was not only a newfound method for temperature measurement but
also a method for level measurement. This can be done with FBG sensors to measure

the liquid level in an LNG storage tank. By using the refractive indexes of LNG with
the time delay of the light being sent and received the level can be measured. The

temperature and the liquid measurement could be done with one instrument. Therefore,

reducing the cost of using multiple instruments to monitor the storage tank. At this
stage it is still being developed.

For CT of LNG, the clear winner is Coriolis mass flow measurement because of the

highest accuracy. It is the only one that has no problem being certified for CT

compared to USFM and TFM. It is cheaper and has less requirements for the
installation. For flow measurement of LNG, Coriolis is still the clear favorite compared

to orifice plate. However, the cost of the orifice plate still makes it attractable even
with lover accuracy compared to the other methods. Coriolis and orifice are both

common methods used in LNG processes. USFM and TFM are also common but not
as extensively.

Some limitations had to be made to reduce the further research of flow measurement.

Only common methods were in focus. However, more information about vortex
volumetric flow measurement should have been presented. It is known to be suitable
for LNG flow measurement, but it was later revealed that it is possible for CT. It is a
new method for CT and has not penetrated the market yet.

All methods applicable for LNG should be included in this thesis. However, there

might be methods missing. These methods might be newer research methods with
limited accessibility of information or outdated methods not applicable anymore. A

considerable amount of time has been put into searching all methods used for
cryogenics. There are articles and handbooks which mention monitoring methods for

105

cryogenic process. However, all the methods mentioned have not been included in one
single document except for instruments for flow measurement. Certain methods are

only used in laboratory environment or are experimental. These cannot be used for

now in the industry. They were important discoveries and they were included in this
thesis as they can be future monitoring methods.

Certain attributes could not be found for some instruments, e.g., the cost and the

installation method. This is due to the lack of available information that reduces the
reliability when comparing instruments. The comparison of the methods could be

improved by requesting quotations from manufacturers. With the design conditions

and other requirements, the manufacturer could send technical information of the

measuring instrument. A direct comparison of instruments could be done with the
technical specification and therefore provide a more reliable result. This would also
include other types of information (e.g., safety certifications, installation methods and

total cost), which would give more accurate information. However, this is more time
consuming. Direct contact with the manufacturer is needed and it is important that the

technical information is in accordance with the design specifications for the
comparison.

Based on the results, certain instruments deserve more focus than others. However, in
order to achieve the results, the information needed to be documented. All possible
methods were of interest and specific information related to the methods was needed.

The list of standards includes information regarding instruments, design, installation
method etc. The list increases the available information, since only few standards were

known from the start. Within the standards further reading is provided as they include

other standards. The standards helped with finding the real need for instruments and
design decision, but there are still some limitations. Certain standards can be used for

certain processes. There was little to no information specified directly for LNG
satellite terminal, truck loading/unloading, or cryogenic control system in general.

Standards related to specific instruments were found but could not be accessible. Those
standards could provide additional information.

Information and standards for CT of LNG between a carrier and a storage tank are well

documented. For truck unloading to storage tank, the information is lacking or non-

106

existing. It can be hard to standardize this because the truck container design varies

between countries. The trucks are usually operated by another company than the one
running the LNG satellite terminal. The LNG satellite terminal design was originally

derived from cryogenic standards. The cryogenic industry generally has fewer control
and automation operations compared to LNG processes, resulting in a lack of available
information. The truck loading/unloading process is often not the focus compared to

other LNG processes. The LNG satellite terminal design is a new concept, hence no

standard is developed for the satellite terminal and the truck transfer. A standard
reflects the industry’s good practice and requires consensus. Hopefully with time, a
standard will be established.

As mentioned in the results, all questions have not been answered for the critical
instruments. Certain answers were found but other problems are yet to be resolved.

Specific answers to problems can be hard to find. This applies especially to industry

related issues, as industries might not want to report the issues. Therefore, the problem
is never presented, and a solution is never considered.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The thesis focuses on the LNG satellite terminal, but the instruments and methods
presented can be used for other LNG processes. They can be used for e.g., large import

terminals, liquefaction plants, and flat bottom tanks, if the operating conditions are the

same. Therefore, this thesis provides measuring methods applicable for all LNG
facilities.

The results reflect well onto the expectations of this thesis. The main objectives of the

thesis are accomplished in one way or another with valuable results. The instruments

used for the standard pressurized LNG satellite terminal were reviewed. The technical

information from the instruments was established. The second objective of analyzing
the need for each instrument was achieved with the help of standards in order to have

a baseline of requirements. From there, why the instruments are needed can be found.

The third objective of finding new methods or instruments for measuring process

values was achieved as well. Several new methods were found, and the result of the
best methods complies with what is currently used in the industry. Most of the focus
was allocated to this part since more information was requested of the measuring

method. The fourth objective, reviewing the control and instrument communication
from a reliability, safety, and economical point of view, was not achieved. This was

included when finding new measuring methods instead, in order to compare the
methods with each other. The final objective of finalizing instrument specifications

was achieved. The need for the instruments and guidelines to be followed was

established. New methods were found and compared to existing methods in order to
determine which is the best measuring method. Answers related to critical components
were found, but not all of them were answered during the time of writing this thesis.

The thesis improves the knowledge of terms, standards and methodology for
instruments to the design engineer. The focus is to give the design engineer knowledge
of instruments from an instrument perspective. Usually, the LNG process is developed

first, and then the instrumentation for the process is included. This thesis is meant for

the design engineer to integrate the design for both the process and the instrument at
the same time. This is to ensure a dynamic solution that focuses on presenting the best
solution with both objectives in mind.

108

From the company’s perspective the results are satisfying as most of the objectives
have been answered. The work presented in this thesis is of value to the company. The

subjects of the thesis have evolved around the information that the company requested.
If more knowledge of a subject was needed, it has been investigated in order to give a

more detailed description. The only objective which is not discussed extensively is the

fourth objective. Here further work can be done by performing reliability calculations
of the current instruments that are used in the LNG satellite terminal.

The third and the fourth objective can be investigated even further. By contacting

manufacturers and receiving technical information regarding an instrument, a better
result of the comparison can be achieved. Other valuable information such as an

accuracy rating, an installation guide, and the total cost of the instrument can be
received as well. With the technical information, reliability calculations can be made
on all the instruments. This can be compared with other related measuring instrument
to discover which instrument is the safest to use in the LNG process.

Further research can be done by investigating why certain measuring methods are not
available for commercial use. This is interesting since certain methods have been

available for years, but not implemented for the industry. The reason behind this could

provide answers and would be good to have, e.g., knowing if it is related to operational

performance, safety of the process, or selection of materials for the design of the

instrument. Information regarding the time when instruments can be used for the
industry would also be interesting to know. Can certain instrument be available within
a couple of months? Is it a five-year period including test runs and other certification
procedures that needs to be performed before becoming available? The answers to

these questions can help when planning the control system and the design of an LNG
process.

The possibility of building a test facility is something that can be performed in the
future. When a suitable monitoring method has been established, a practical test should

be performed to see if the theoretical information is correct. The test facility should
include all the equipment in an LNG satellite terminal. It should also be possible to
interchange the instruments ensuring all methods can be tested. The data received from

the measuring instruments should be stored. Therefore, the data can be compared over
a longer time period with measurement data from other instruments. This is of course

109

expensive, and careful consideration should be done whether the information achieved
is worth the cost.

There are new methods developed for the LNG industry as proven in this thesis, but
they are not of the highest priority. Considering the technology and processes that can

be researched within the LNG industry, less focus is placed onto the control system

and even less on instrumentation. There are applicable measuring methods within the
LNG industry which have yielded a good operational performance for a long period

of time. More research on instrumentation for cryogenic conditions can be found when
the operating environment is harsh, e.g., strong presence of magnetic field or space.

However, the research into the instrumentation for the LNG process should be focused

on as equally as on improving the overall performance of the LNG process. After all,

the safe operation of an LNG process is the most important factor within the industry.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Optimering av mätinstrument och kontrollsystem för en standard
trycksatt LNG-satellitterminal
Naturgas

är

en

ren

energikälla

jämfört

med

andra

fossila

bränslen.

Den kan förvaras och transporteras som flytande naturgas (LNG) vid en temperatur på
-162 °C och ett tryck på över 1 atm. Detta av ekonomiska orsaker, volymen för LNG
är 600 gånger mindre än för naturgas, och säkerhetsskäl, explosionsrisken minskar

med ett högre tryck och förhindrar att luft läcker in. Byggandet av
mottagningsterminaler

för

LNG

har

ökat

under

de

senaste

åren.

En

mottagningsterminal har som uppgift att ta emot LNG som transporterats av

hangarfartyg, förvara, återförgasa och leverera naturgas till slutanvändaren via långa
sträckor med rörsystem.

Av geografiska skäl kan inte alla tänkbara slutanvändare nås via långa rörsystem, och
därför används LNG-satellitterminaler. En satellitterminal är en småskalig

mottagningsterminal. Den innehåller samma processer och utrustning som en större

mottagningsterminal men LNG levereras med hjälp av vägtransport till
satellitterminalen.

Övervakningen av LNG-processer är viktigt för säkerheten i alla LNG-anläggningar.

Det är nödvändigt att ha ett pålitligt övervakningssystem för att förutse och förhindra

problem som är processrelaterade. Tillgängligheten av noggranna mätdata från
processens mätinstrument är viktigt och korrekt information ska överföras till
kontrollrummet för att kunna kontrollera processerna.

Syftet med denna avhandling är att ge en bättre förståelse av mätinstrumenten som

används för en LNG-process. Målet är att undersöka vilka mätinstrument som används
i en standard trycksatt LNG-satellitterminal. Vidare analyseras kraven på och behovet

av mätinstrumenten. Avsikten är att hitta nya mätmetoder eller mätinstrument för
övervakningen av LNG-processer. Därtill undersöks kontrollsystemets och

111

mätinstrumentens kommunikation för att bedöma deras tillförlitlighet och säkerhet

samt för att överväga ekonomiska perspektiv. Slutligen ska specifikationerna för
mätinstrumenten presenteras utgående från erhållna resultat.

Alla processer i LNG-satellitterminalen beskrivs inte i föreliggande arbetet, utan
endast förvaring, återförgasning och påfyllning. Processerna levereras som
nyckelfärdiga moduler och därmed måste mätinstrumentens storlek beaktas. Alla

tänkbara mätmetoder som kan användas för kryogenisk temperatur nämns kortfattat
och undersöks för att bestämma om de kan tillämpas i LNG-övervakning. Gällande

flödesmätare begränsades undersökningen till att omfatta de flödesmätare som är
vanligast och som kan användas för överföring av LNG.

En LNG-satellitterminal är en liten terminal för mottagning av LNG, förvaring och
återförgasning som allt sker inom satellitterminalen. Den används ofta i kombination
med

ett

gaskraftverk.

Storleken

på

satelliteterminalen

definieras

enligt

förvaringstankarnas storlek och kapaciteten ligger mellan 100 och 20 000 m 3. De utgör
den dyraste kostnaden för satellitterminalen. Processen i satellitterminalen börjar med
att LNG levereras med tankbilar. Tankbilen ansluts till mottagningsmodulen med hjälp

av slangar och förvaringstanken påfylls via ett trycksatt rörsystem. Den maximala
flödeshastigheten är 100 m3/h och styrs av trycket som är ca 1 MPa. Trycket i systemet

kontrolleras med hjälp av en pump eller en tryckökningsenhet.

Förvaringstanken är cylinderformad, vakuumisolerad och antingen horisontellt eller

vertikalt installerad beroende på säkerhetsanalyser. Flera förvaringstankar kan
användas för att öka förvaringskapaciteten. Tanken består av ett inre och yttre kärl för

att kunna förvara LNG säkert. Om det inre kärlet går sönder kommer LNG fortfarande
att förvaras inuti tanken. Konstruktionen förhindrar också spridning av naturgas som
förångats i förvaringstanken.

Då LNG ska levereras till slutkunden sänds LNG till förångningen. Här värms LNG

upp och blir till naturgas igen. Den vanligaste typen av förångare i LNGsatellitterminaler

är en luftförångare

eller

förångare med mellanliggande

värmeväxlare. Förångare med mellanliggande värmeväxlare är ett slutet system med

112

en värmeöverförande vätska från en värmekälla. Vätskan är vanligen en blandning

mellan vatten och glykol vilket ger en hög värmekoefficient. Värmekällan kan vara
upphettat vatten, ånga eller spillvärme beroende på vad som finns tillgängligt.

Luftförångaren extraherar värme från omgivande luft och kräver inte en
mellanliggande värmeväxlare. Luftförångaren föredras för att den har konstaterats
vara miljövänligare och billigare. Däremot krävs flera stycken för att uppnå samma
effekt.

Kontrollsystemet är uppbyggt att vara så säkert som möjligt. Det består av ett
processkontrollsystem och nödstoppssystem. Processkontrollsystemet består av

mätinstrument och apparater som övervakar och reglerar processerna. Huvuduppgiften
för detta system är att upprätthålla processens variabler och en stabil process.
Processvariablerna är tryck, temperatur, flöde och vätskenivå. Nödstoppssystemet är

uppbyggt av säkerhetsinstrument och är ett separat system. Dessa instrument har som
uppgift att förhindra uppkomsten av problem och stoppa processerna vid ett nödalarm.

Säkerhetsinstrumenten innehåller olika funktioner som måste uppfyllas för att
upprätthålla en säker process vid en eventuell fara. Dessa funktioner består av
säkerhetsintegritetsnivåer från 1 – 4. Nivån indikerar hur bra säkerhetsinstrumentet

hanterar processen vid en fara. En högre siffra indikerar en lägre risk för att det uppstår
en fara. Säkerhetsintegritetsnivåerna kan beräknas och ska bekräftas av tillverkaren.

Mätinstrument används för direkt eller indirekt mätning, övervakning och kontroll av
processvariabler. Digitala mätinstrument kan uppkopplas till kontrollsystemet för att

överföra noggranna mätdata. Mätinstrument som kan utföra flera typer av mätningar
är att föredra. Det är viktigt att förstå skillnaden mellan mätinstrument som används.

Till exempel om det är en detektor, sändare eller elektronisk omvandlare. Med ett
digitalt mätinstrument ökas säkerheten, tillförlitligheten och effektiviteten i en process.

Överföring av LNG är vanligt inom LNG-industrin. För detta krävs speciella
flödesmätare med en stor noggrannhet. Det kringliggande systemet kräver också en

stor noggrannhet. Andra krav och regler måste också följas. Dessa och själva
överföringen av LNG övervakas av myndigheter och anmält organ.

113

Den standard trycksatta LNG-satellitterminalen undersöktes för att ta reda på vilka
mätinstrument som används. Information om dessa dokumenterades för att kunna

hänvisa till vad som är kraven för mätinstrumenten. Samtidigt konstaterade det att det

finns avvikande mätinstrument. Med avvikande mätinstrument avses de mätinstrument

som inte fungerar som förväntats, ett annat mätinstrument föredras eller
mätinstrumentet ska leverera noggrannare mätdata och vara kostnadseffektivt. Totalt

var åtta mätinstrument avvikande för LNG-satellitterminalen och majoriteten av
problemen var relaterade till temperaturmätning. Övriga problem gällde nivå- och

flödesmätning. Dessa avvikande mätinstrument medförde att informationssökningen
måste utvidgas för att analysera varför instrumenten är nödvändiga.

För att analysera behovet av mätinstrument behövdes information. Informationen
innehåller

behovet,

valet,

konstruktionen

och

installationen

för

varför

mätinstrumenten används. Det framkom att valet av mätinstrument baserade sig på

riskanalyser, designingenjörens egen kunskap och normer inom branschen. Bredare

kunskap om ämnet krävdes och därmed granskades tillgänglig information i nationella
standarder för LNG-anläggningar.

EN 1473:2019 är en standard för landbaserad konstruktion av LNG-anläggningar. I
denna standard kunde övriga standarder hittas som kunde användas för att få
information relaterad till mätinstrument. I början söktes endast information relaterad

till mätinstrumenten. Detta utökades till att inkludera information så som

installationsmetoder och konstruktion av LNG-processer. På grund av de avvikande
mätinstrumenten krävdes information om överföring av LNG, krav på mätsystem och

specifikationer för kontrollsystemet. Alla använda standarder och resultat av
informationssökningen återges i detta arbete.

Undersökningen av nya metoder för övervakning av LNG-processer utvidgades
genom att tillämpa mätinstrument som används inom kryogena processer. De flesta

kryogena mätinstrument kan användas för LNG med vissa undantag. Alla tänkbara

metoder nämns i detta arbete men om metoden inte kan tillämpas för LNG utesluts

den. Metoderna eller mätinstrumenten är tagna ur tekniska handböcker och
vetenskapliga undersökningar. Vissa metoder är väl etablerade inom branschen medan

114

andra endast är experimentella eller används i laboratorium. För att undersöka vilka
metoder som passar bäst för övervakningen undersöktes olika egenskaper. Dessa
egenskaper är tillgänglighet, teknisk information, noggrannhet, mätområde,

driftområde, installation, tillförlitlighet och kostnader. För- och nackdelar undersöktes
också.

Totalt har fem metoder för tryckmätning hittats och alla är anpassade för LNG. Sex

metoder hittades för temperaturmätning men endast fyra som lämpar sig för LNG. Åtta
nivåmätningsmetoder hittades men endast fem rekommenderas för nivåmätning i
förvaringstanken. 16 metoder hittades för flödesmätning men detta begränsades till

endast fyra tänkbara flödesmätningar. Dessa jämförs i resultatet för att se vilken metod
som är bäst anpassad för övervakning.

Dokumenteringen av de nya metoderna som hittades är viktiga att ha inför framtiden.

De kan finnas tillgängliga inom en snar framtid och då är det viktigt att veta att man
har sett metoderna tidigare. Metoderna kan vara billigare, ha enklare konstruktion och
installationsmetod, större driftområde eller presentera bättre resultat med en stor

noggrannhet. En av de nya metoder som hittades är Fiber Bragg Grating, som använder

sig av optisk teknologi. Denna metod har utvecklats specifikt för temperatur- och
nivåövervakning av LNG i förvaringstankar. Den är av intresse för att den eliminerar

säkerhetsrisker som finns med nuvarande mätinstrument som används i
förvaringstankar.

De tillgängliga mätinstrument som undersökts i denna avhandling och som anses vara
bäst lämpade för övervakningen av LNG-processer är sådana som används inom

industrin i dagsläget. För tryckmätning är piezoresistiva tryckgivare den bästa

lösningen. De har högst noggrannhet, brett driftområde och är kostnadseffektiva. För
temperaturmätning står valet mellan en resistent

temperaturdetektor eller

termoelement. Båda används inom branschen i en bred utsträckning, har liknande
användningsområden och kan bytas ut sinsemellan. Skillnaderna är att en resistent

temperaturdetektor är lite mer noggrannare och har stabilare drift medan ett
termoelement är billigare. Termoelement används oftare i laboratorier.

115

För nivåmätning står valet mellan en differentialtrycksensor eller en guidad nivåradar.

Differentialtrycksensorer har länge varit ett naturligt val för nivåmätning och är
piezoresistiva tryckgivare. En differentialtrycksensor använder sig av trycket för att

kunna beräkna nivån i tanken medan guidad nivåradar innehåller en kabel som placeras
inne i tanken och känner av vätskan och gasen. Användningen av guidad nivåradar har

ökat under de senaste åren och blir allt vanligare. Båda har stor noggrannhet och ett
brett driftområde. Båda har dessvärre brister inom olika delområden. Om mätningen
ska vara oberoende av densitet ska guidad nivåradar användas. Valet mellan dessa
avgörs av den totala kostnaden och förvaringstankens konstruktion.

För flödesmätning används olika typer av flödesmätare. Den första är en Coriolismätare som använder sig av Corioliseffekten för att mäta massflödet. Nästa är en
volymflödesmätare som använder sig av en turbin. Följande är en akustisk

flödesmätare som använder sig av ultraljud för att mäta volymen. Slutligen används

en strypfläns med en differenstryckmätare för att beräkna massflödet. För överföring
av LNG kan de tre fösta användas. Strypflänsen är inte tillåten på grund av för liten

noggrannhet. Coriolis-mätaren är det bästa alternativet för överföring av LNG. Den
mäter massflödet med en stor noggrannhet och är billigare än de två andra
flödesmätarna. Volymflödesmätarna kan också användas men har större krav för att

bli godkända för överföring av LNG. Volymflödesmätaren med en turbin innehåller
rörliga delar vilket man helst undviker. Coriolis-mätaren har den bästa noggrannheten

och mäter direkt massflödet medan strypflänsen är minst noggrann. De två övriga
flödesinstrumenten mäter volymflödet i processen med lite sämre noggrannhet än
Coriolis-mätaren. Trots att strypflänsen är minst noggrann är den ändå ett starkt

alternativ till Coriolis-mätaren då det kommer till flödesmätningen. Den är betydligt

billigare och då kraven för överföring av LNG inte behöver följas, är det en
flödesmätare som hellre används för att spara på utgifterna.

Det är viktigt att känna till standarder och veta var man hittar information om
mätinstrumenten och design på LNG-processerna. Det finns dock ingen standard som
är specifikt skriven för en LNG-satellitterminal. Detta beror på många olika saker men

framför allt är en LNG-satellitterminal ett nytt koncept inom LNG-industrin. En

standard återspeglar god praxis inom branschen och kräver konsensus mellan

116

medlemsländerna i internationella standardiseringsorganisationen. Med tiden kommer
förhoppningsvis en standard för LNG-satelitterminal att kunna upprättas.

De metoder som presenteras i avhandlingen är alla lämpade för användning i alla
LNG-processer och inte bara för en satellitterminal. Målen med denna avhandling
uppnåddes i stort. När det gäller kontrollsystemet och mätinstrumenten kunde vidare

undersökningar göras med avseende på säkerhet, tillförlitlighet och ekonomiska

perspektiv. Då man valt ett instrument kunde pålitlighetsberäkningar göras utgående
från teknisk information från tillverkaren. Jämförandet av mätinstrumenten kan
förbättras genom att få teknisk information från tillverkaren. Då får man information

om det mätinstrument man vill ha istället för att utgå från generell information och kan
utföra en noggrannare jämförelse. Med att ta kontakt med tillverkaren får man också
information som till exempel noggrannhet, installationsanvisningar och totala
kostnader.

Nya mätmetoder utvecklas inom LNG-industrin vilket visas i denna avhandling. Det

har dock inte högsta prioritet då det kommer till utvecklingen. Fokuset inom

LNG-industrin ligger mera på processerna i sin helhet och utrustningen än på
kontrollsystemet och mätinstrumenten. Det finns etablerade övervakningssystem inom

branschen. Flera undersökningar om nya mätinstrument går att finna där driftmiljön är
mera krävande som till exempel i rymden. Det vore även viktigt att utveckla nya
övervakningsmetoder eftersom en säker drift av en LNG-process är det viktigaste
kravet inom LNG-industrin.
