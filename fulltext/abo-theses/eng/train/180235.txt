Extractives cause various problems in pulp and paper mills, so the removal of extractives
from the process is desired. To assess the efficiency of the removal of extractives,
accurate analysis techniques need to be employed, and the analyses should also preferably
be fast and easy to perform. Calcium causes additional problems because it decreases the
washing efficiency. This work aimed at finding the best analytical method for unbleached
birch kraft pulp and wash filtrate, especially at high calcium levels. This was done by
performing several analysis procedures on mill samples, and from these methods the three
most promising methods for pulps and the three most promising methods for wash
filtrates were chosen for further analysis on laboratory samples cooked specifically for
this work.

Six laboratory cooks were made, three with added betulinol and fatty acids to the cooks.
Three different calcium contents were used; low with acid-soaked chips, normal with
water-soaked chips, and high with water-soaked chips and added calcium. The three
cooks without added extractives and the three cooks with added extractives had different
contents of calcium. The raw materials were analysed, as were all the fractions from the
cooks, i.e., pulp, black liquor, and wash filtrate. This resulted in a complete picture of the
extractives, i.e., if everything that was added to the process could also be detected after
the process, and in which fractions the different extractives were detected.
With low calcium content, most extractives were found in the wash filtrate. When the
calcium content was increased, more extractives were found in the black liquor, and at
high calcium content, more extractives were also found in the pulp, showing that calcium
decreased the washing efficiency. There were some discrepancies between the detected
extractives before and after the cooks.
Regarding the recommendations of analysis methods, the most accurate, fast, and easy
method for pulp was ASE with a solvent mixture of acetone, water, and acetic acid in the
ratio 95:4:1, and for the wash filtrate the most accurate, fast and easy method was
acidification of the wash filtrate to pH 3.5, followed by liquid-liquid extraction with
MTBE. The extracts should then be silylated and analysed with GC.

Introduction

1 Introduction
Kraft pulping is currently the most widely used chemical pulping technique (Alén,
2011a). During pulping of wood, cellulose fibres are liberated, and these fibres can then
be used for papermaking, or they can be refined into cellulose derivatives or regenerated
cellulose after additional treatment. As much as possible of lignin and extractives are
removed in the pulping process, as well as some of the hemicelluloses. If extractives are
not removed, they can cause various problems in the pulping process and reduce the
quality of the final product (Alén, 2011b). Pulping of birch wood is more challenging
than pulping of softwoods because the content of saponifiable extractives, which facilitate
the removal of other extractives, is lower in birch than in most other woods (Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000).
Metal ions are detrimental to the deresination in kraft mills (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).
Especially calcium has been found to complicate the deresination by forming insoluble
calcium soaps with fatty acids. This hinders the fatty acids from forming micelles and
thereby decreases the washing efficiency (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000; Ström, 2000).
Analysis of extractives is important to make sure that the pulp product is of good quality,
i.e., contains as little extractives as possible. This work has focused on finding the best
analytical method for extractives analysis of unbleached birch kraft pulp and filtrate. The
effect of calcium, especially in high concentrations, on extractives in the kraft process
and on the analysis of the extractives has also been an important part of this work.

2 Theory
This chapter will focus on extractives and their relation to the kraft process. Extractives
in birch will be in the spotlight.

2.1 Extractives
Trees consist mainly of cellulose, as well as notable fractions of hemicelluloses and lignin
(Alén, 2000b). In addition to these structural components, there are also non-structural
components in trees, such as inorganics and extractives (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b;
Alén, 2011b). The extractives group comprises many compounds with different structures
and they usually have a low molecular mass. They are mainly found in the parenchyma
cells of the tree, and according to Back (2000b) parenchyma cells in birch contain 40 %
extractives. Softwoods also have resin canals, which contain oleoresins, mostly
monoterpenes and resin acids (Alén, 2000b; Back, 2000b). The function of extractives
can be to protect the tree from harmful microbes or insects, or to serve as energy storage
(Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b; Alén, 2011b).
Due to the vast number of compounds that are identified as extractives, they are further
divided into subgroups. For example, extractives can be characterized based on their
hydrophobicity. Hydrophobic extractives are commonly referred to as wood resin and can
be extracted by neutral organic solvents, e.g., acetone, hexane, or methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE), but not by water (Alén, 2011b). These components include fatty acids, steryl
esters, sterols and triterpenoids (Back & Ekman, 2000).
The composition and content of extractives varies between tree species (Alén, 2000b).
For example, silver birch (Betula pendula) comprises 1.0–3.5 % extractives, whereas
scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) can have between 2.5 % and 4.5 % extractives. The content
also varies between the trees in a species, the time of year, the age of the tree, the
geographical location of the tree (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000), and the part of the tree
(Sjöström, 1993; Nisula, 2018). After a tree is felled, or when heartwood is formed, the
parenchyma cells die and the extractives can undergo enzymatic hydrolysis (Back,
2000b). For example, tri- and diglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids, which are
usually found only in small amounts in the sapwood of living trees. The storage conditions
affect the content of extractives in the wood material, for example wet conditions speed
up the hydrolysis of glycerides as opposed to dry conditions (Alén, 2000b; Alén, 2011b).

2.1.1 Extractives in birch wood
Birch wood contains 1.0–3.5 % extractives, all of which is located in the parenchyma
cells of the tree (Back, 2000a; Back, 2000b). In the heartwood of trees, i.e., the middle of
the stem, where the parenchyma cells are dead, some extractives undergo chemical
reactions. For example, esterified components such as triglycerides and steryl esters are
hydrolysed into mostly fatty acids.
Fatty acids in the sapwood of the tree are mostly in the form of triglycerides (Holmbom,
2011), which are esters of fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are found both as saturated
and unsaturated. The most common fatty acids in trees are unsaturated, namely linoleic
acid and oleic acid (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000), the structures of which can be seen in
figure 2.1. Birch trees usually have a fatty acid content of 1–2 %, one of the highest in
hardwoods, which more commonly have a fatty acid content of 0.2–0.5 % (Holmbom,
2011). Birches also have an especially high content of triglycerides, where linoleic acid
is the most common fatty acid component (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).

Figure 2.1. Molecular structure of the two most abundant fatty acids in wood: linoleic
acid and oleic acid (modified from Karlsson, et al., 2001).

Triterpenoids and sterols are found in most trees (Alén, 2000b). These components
usually form esters with fatty acids (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b; Holmbom, 2011),
resulting in steryl esters. Sterols and triterpenoids are sometimes referred to as different
groups, but because of their similar structure (Sjöström, 1993), they will in this work be
referred to as belonging to the group triterpenoids. The most abundant triterpenoid in most
hardwoods is sitosterol (figure 2.2) (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b; Ekman & Holmbom,
2000). Other triterpenoids that are usually present in hardwoods in high quantities are
cycloartenol, 24-methylene cycloartanol and citrostadienol (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).
Squalene is a precursor to the triterpenoids (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b; Yin, et al.,
2012) and is present in all trees (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000a). Most trees contain

Pinja Lillrank

Theory

triterpenoids, but only hardwoods also contain compounds belonging to the subgroup
triterpenyl alcohols, such as betulinol, lupeol and methyl betulinate (Holmbom, 2011),
the molecular structures of which are found in figure 2.2. Triterpenoids are lipophilic
compounds, and they function as protection against harmful microbes and insects (Back
& Ekman, 2000; Yin, et al., 2012).

Figure 2.2. Molecular structures of sitosterol and the triterpenyl alcohols betulinol,
lupeol and methyl betulinate. The differences in the structures between the triterpenyl
alcohols are marked in orange (modified from Vikström, et al., 2005).

Betulaprenols are specific to birch (Sjöström, 1993; Alén, 2000b; Ekman & Holmbom,
2000). They are prenols with six to nine isoprene units and are in the form of fatty acid
esters in the tree. The general structure is shown in figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3. General structure of betulaprenols (modified from Vikström, et al., 2005).

Heartwood and sapwood differ in their composition of extractives (Back, 2000a). For
example, heartwood contains less esters and more free fatty acids, since the esters are

Pinja Lillrank

Theory

hydrolysed. In sapwood, the fatty acids are mostly in the form of di- and triglycerides and
steryl esters.
2.1.2 Extractives in birch bark
Birch bark consists of a hydrophobic outer bark and a hydrophilic inner bark (Holmbom,
2011). The outer bark has been studied in more detail, and it has been found that 40 % of
the outer bark of silver birch (Betula pendula) consists of extractives, most of which is
betulinol. In addition to extractives, the outer bark also contains suberin (45 %), lignin
(9 %), hemicelluloses (4 %) and cellulose (2 %). Almost a third of birch outer bark has
been found to consist of betulinol, which gives the bark its characteristic white colour
(Alén, 2000b; Back, 2000b; Ekman & Holmbom, 2000; Holmbom, 2011). Other
extractives in birch bark entail lupeol and other triterpenoids (Holmbom, 2011).
Birch bark contains ten times as much extractives as birch wood (Back, 2000a; Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000). Betulinol, which is abundant in the bark, is absent from the wood. This
means that if bark enters the kraft process, it causes problems. Especially the high content
of betulinol, which is not soluble in the kraft process waters, can cause problems (Back,
2000b). Birch bark also contains up to ten times more calcium than the wood, adding to
the problems in pulping if bark enters the process (Back, 2000a).
2.1.3 Extractives in birch pulp
Glycerides and esters hydrolyse during wood storage and alkaline pulping, which means
that pulp has a higher content of free fatty acids and a lower content of esterified
components than native wood (Ström, 2000). Sitosterol, which is the most abundant
triterpenoid in trees, is also the most abundant triterpenoid in the pulp (Alén, 2000a).
Squalene, which is present in all trees, is found in higher contents in birch pulp than in
other pulps. Birch pulp usually contains some betulinol even though there is no betulinol
present in the birch wood (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). The betulinol in the pulp is a
residue from the birch bark, which is hard to remove completely and is usually a source
of impurities like betulinol in the pulp.

2.2 Kraft pulping
The kraft pulping process was developed in the end of the 19th century and was first
named the sulphate process (Kleppe, 1970). The process was widely adopted in

Pinja Lillrank

Theory

6

Scandinavia, where they noticed that the products from this process were stronger than
products originating from other pulping processes. The word “kraft” in Swedish means
“strength”, and the sulphate process was referred to by this new name, which is widely
used today as a standard name for the sulphate process. Today, kraft pulping is the most
widely used chemical pulping process and has been so since the mid-20th century
(Kleppe, 1970; Alén, 2011a).
In the kraft process, the cooking chemicals are known as effective alkali (EA) and consist
of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphide (Na2S) (Alén, 2011a). These
chemicals are added to the cook with the white liquor. After the cook when the chemicals
have been used, they are removed from the cooking process as black liquor. The black
liquor also contains some extractives, inorganics, lignin fragments and degradation
products of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses. To recover the cooking chemicals, the
water is evaporated from the black liquor until the dry content is about 65–80 %, after
which the black liquor is burned in the recovery furnace. This also generates energy and
heat, which is recovered. The resulting smelt from the combustion of the black liquor
contains sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium sulphide (Na2S) and some sodium sulphate
(Na2SO4). Water is added to the smelt, resulting in what is called green liquor, which is
then causticized with lime (CaO). The result of this recovery process is white liquor, as
Na2CO3 reacts to NaOH in the causticizing step. The recovery process is incomplete, and
the white liquor also contains some Na2CO3 and sodium salts.
Most of the extractives in the pulping process are recovered from the gases as crude
sulphate turpentine or are skimmed off from the black liquor during the evaporation stage
as tall oil soap (Alén, 2011a). The majority of the extractives remaining in the black liquor
after this are fatty acids, or if using softwood, fatty and resin acids. Crude tall oil is
acquired after liberating the fatty acids by adding H2SO4 to the skimmed portion of the
black liquor. The content of fatty acids in crude tall oil is about 20–40 % and contains
mostly linoleic and oleic fatty acids.
The chemical reactions in the kraft process are complex and not yet fully deciphered
(Alén, 2011a). Around 50 % of the original wood is degraded in the kraft process, most
of which is lignin, but some polysaccharides also degrade.

2.2.1 Extractives in the kraft process
Birch is one of the hardwood species that has a high content of extractives, which makes
it problematic for pulping (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). Compared to softwoods, birch
has a higher content of unsaponifiable extractives. It has been suggested that instead of
just focusing on the total content of extractives, a better estimation of the severity of pitch
problems in pulping can be achieved by looking at the ratio of saponifiable-tounsaponifiable extractives. A lower ratio would mean more pitch problems, and birches
have a much lower ratio than e.g., pine and spruce. For less pitch problems, the ratio
should be 3:1 or higher, and in birch the ratio is usually around 1:1 or 2:1.
The division of extractives into saponifiables and unsaponifiables is helpful when pulping
and papermaking processes and the effects of extractives on these processes are discussed
(Ström, 2000). Fatty and resin acids belong to the saponifiables, whereas neutrals such as
glycerides and steryl esters of fatty acids, as well as triterpenoids, make up most of the
unsaponifiables. The extractives in hardwood pulps from alkaline pulping usually
comprise roughly two thirds fatty acids and one third unsaponifiables.
The saponifiables and the unsaponifiables behave differently in aqueous solutions (Ström,
2000). In alkaline environments, the saponifiable organic acids dissociate and form soaps,
which can form micelles. In the form of micelles, the organic acids are easily washed out.
The micelles also help to solubilize other polar extractives, neutrals and metal soaps and
wash these out as well. The more micelles there are in the solution, the more extractives
can be solubilized. The ratio of resin acid soaps to fatty acid soaps also affects the
solubility; the ratio 1:1 seems to result in the highest solubility. Since hardwoods do not
contain resin acids, the solubilization of the neutrals is less efficient than when softwoods
are used for pulping (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). Other factors also affect the solubility,
mainly through affecting how easily micelles are formed (Ström, 2000). Such factors are
temperature, pH, ionic strength and hydrophobicity of the medium. Another factor that
may affect deresination negatively in hardwoods compared to softwoods, is that
hardwoods contain a higher proportion of long chain fatty acids (C20–C24) (Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000).
Because birch is a hardwood and as such does not contain resin acids, tall oil is usually
added to the beginning of the cook for improved deresination (Back, 2000a). However,
extractives that might deposit on fibres and other surfaces also enter the cook with the
added tall oil. For the tall oil to be beneficial for deresination it needs to contain mostly

Pinja Lillrank

Theory

8

fatty and resin acids. If the added tall oil has too high a concentration of neutrals, it will
harm the deresination. For better deresination, the tall oil should have a high acid number
and it should contain unsaturated acids as well as short chain fatty acids (C14–C16). When
tall oil is added to the cook, more washing needs to be done for the extractives to be
removed.
Most of the extractives are dispersed or dissolved in the black liquor in the last stages of
the cook (Back, 2000a). In this part of the cook, a high amount of effective alkali is
beneficial for deresination. If the temperatures are kept at normal cooking temperatures,
the extractives are removed with the black liquor. However, extractives precipitate from
the black liquor when the temperatures are lowered, so if this is done before removing the
black liquor, the extractives will precipitate and adsorb onto the fibres.
2.2.2 Effects of calcium on pulping
Calcium reacts with fatty and resin acids, forming metal soaps (Ekman & Holmbom,
2000). Resin acid metal soaps are more soluble than fatty acid metal soaps, and because
hardwoods such as birch do not contain resin acids, the calcium soaps are more
problematic in hardwood mills than in softwood mills. The fatty acids in the metal soaps
need to be converted to their protonated form in order for extraction of them to be
possible. The conversion can be facilitated by acidifying the sample, after which
extraction can be performed. To prohibit the calcium from reacting with the organic acids,
it can be bound by complexing agents (Ström, 2000). Lignin is an example of such an
agent, but it loses its complexing ability rapidly with decreasing pH. Instead, chelants
such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) can be used to form complexes with calcium ions (Alén, 2011b).

2.3 Extraction
In order for analysis of the extractives to be possible, extraction is needed (Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000). To separate the extractives from the other components of the pulp,
organic solvents are often used. The solvent of choice depends on the hydrophobic
character of the extractive component of interest.

Pinja Lillrank

Theory

9

2.3.1 Pre-treatment
The extractability of a component is affected by its pKa-value, so the pH is very important
for extraction efficiency (Kanicky & Shah, 2003). Alkaline process waters should be
neutralized or acidified before extraction, which can be done by adding mineral acids or
solid acids (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). Metal ions, such as calcium ions, can affect the
extraction negatively. These negative effects can be decreased by complexing the metal
ions with chelating agents (Ström, 2000; Alén, 2011b).
2.3.2 Solvent
A good solvent is the basis of a successful extraction and analysis of the extractives
(Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). Ideally, the chosen solvent should not be toxic and should
extract all extractives completely. In order to do this, the solvent has to penetrate the wood
cells, which can often be problematic. The ideal solvent should also extract only the
extractives of interest, which helps in the interpretation of data by resulting in clean
chromatograms.
Important solvent properties for extraction are polarity and the dielectric constant (Ekman
& Holmbom, 2000). Acetone is a polar solvent with a high dielectric constant (20.7),
which makes it good at penetrating the cell walls and thus it is an efficient solvent for
extraction. However, it is not very specific and there will also be lignans and sugars
present in the extract, which causes extra peaks in the chromatogram and makes the
results harder to interpret. Hexane is a nonpolar solvent and has a low dielectric constant
(1.88). Therefore, it is very specific at extracting only certain extractives, making the
results easier to interpret. However, the samples need to be completely dry when hexane
is used.
2.3.3 Extraction methods
Various extraction methods are used on wood chips, pulp and process effluents from pulp
mills. Three methods are described below, all of which were used in this work. For
information on the standard Soxhlet and Soxtec methods, see SCAN-CM 49:03.
Accelerated solvent extraction
Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is a relatively new extraction method, that has been
proved by different studies to be more efficient than the conventionally used Soxhlet

extraction when extracting from different materials, including pulps (Thurbide & Hughes,
2000), foliage (Péres, et al., 2006) and natural products (Kaufmann & Christen, 2002). In
ASE, the extraction solvent is heated to temperatures above its boiling point, and the
solvent is kept in liquid form by applying a high pressure (1500 psi has been used (Péres,
et al., 2006)). According to Thurbide & Hughes (2000), ASE is 30 times faster and uses
75 % less solvent than traditional Soxhlet extraction.
Reflux
In reflux extraction, the solvent is heated to its boiling point in a flask (Chua, et al., 2016).
The solvent evaporates and is then cooled down so that it condenses and returns to the
flask. The material to be extracted is in the flask, in constant contact with the boiling
solvent. Refluxing is done for a suitable amount of time, depending on the sample.
Liquid-liquid extraction
Liquid-liquid extraction with MTBE on process waters acidified to pH 3.5 is, according
to Valto et al. (2012) the most common extraction technique for process waters and
effluents, and in combination with GC analysis it is the most accurate technique. The
method is presented by Örså & Holmbom (1994).

2.4 Analysis
Analysis of extractives can be divided into three levels: gravimetric determination of the
total content of dissolved solids, determination of extractives groups, and analysis of
individual extractives (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). The recommended method for
quantitative determination of extractives groups is short column GC. Other methods, like
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC), can
also be used, but they are not as accurate as short column GC, because some extractives
groups elute at the same time in these methods. They can, however, be used in
combination with GC to gain information of the individual extractives.
With long column GC, individual extractives can be quantitatively analysed (Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000). A mass-spectrometer can be connected to the GC, in which case the
components’ structures can be analysed and accurate information about which
components are present in the sample is obtained.

In order to acquire reliable results with GC, the extract needs to be derivatized, for
example by silylation (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). In addition, internal standards need to
be used.

3 Experimental
In this chapter, the materials, chemicals, and methods used in this thesis are listed and
explained.

3.1 Materials
The mill pulp samples for the thesis were obtained from a kraft pulp mill in Finland. The
laboratory pulp samples were obtained from six laboratory kraft cooks, done at VTT,
Finland. For the laboratory cooks, birch chips of the same size were chosen for every
cook. The birch chips did not have any visible bark or visible differences in morphology
or colour. These carefully selected birch chips were soaked in either acidified tap water
or in tap water over night before the cook. Sunflower oil, birch bark and CaCl2 were used
as additives. The procedures done at VTT are described in chapter 3.3.
Solid acid Smopex was used in extraction of the mill pulp. DTPA was used in solid form
and to make a DTPA solution, by adding 10 mg DTPA to 40 ml water. This solution will
be referred to as DTPA solution. Phosphate was used in solid form and to make a
phosphate solution, by adding 25 mg phosphate (NaH2PO4) to 10 ml water. This solution
will be referred to as phosphate solution.
A mixture of 0.02 mg/ml cholesterol, heneicosanoic acid (acid 21:0), cholesteryl
heptadecanoate (CH17) and 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol (TG-std) in MTBE was
used as an internal standards mixture for GC analysis. A mixture of pyridine, BSTFA and
TMCS in the ratio 1:4:1 was made for silylation. This mixture will be referred to as
silylation mixture. Bromocresol green (0.04 %) and thymol blue (0.04 %) were used as
pH indicators. Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was used for acidification of samples. All
chemicals used were of analytical grade.

3.2 Mill samples
Pulp from a Finnish kraft pulp mill was treated on site to obtain pulp samples and filtrate
samples. A schematic overview of the samples, pre-treatments, extraction methods and
analyses and determination done on the samples can be seen in figure 3.1.

3.2.1 Preparation of mill samples on site
The pulp at process temperature was diluted to a consistency of 10 % solids directly after
sampling. The pulp was kneaded before it was put in a warm water bath at 60 °C, where
it was kept for an hour. During the time in the warm water bath, the pulp was kneaded by
hand three times for a couple minutes each time. The pulp was filtered on a Buchner
funnel to obtain 100 ml filtrate (termed filtrate). The pulps were then washed twice by
adding 500 ml of water on top of the filter cake and filtering out 500 ml of liquid. These
preparations of the samples were done in duplicate.

samples. The arrows that go straight from the pulp/filtrate sample to the extraction
represents the samples that were not pre-treated.
3.2.2 Pre-treatment of pulps
Three different pre-treatments of the pulps were done before accelerated solvent
extraction (ASE): acidification of the pulp to pH 1, addition of DTPA to the pulp and
addition of phosphate to the pulp.
Acidification to pH 1
An aliquot of the pulp was diluted to 10 % consistency at room temperature, and sulphuric
acid (H2SO4) was added until the pH of the pulp suspension was 1. The pH was measured

Pinja Lillrank

Experimental

14

with an electronic pH meter by squeezing the pulp so the pH could be measured from the
liquid. When pH 1 was reached, the acidified pulp was kept at room temperature for
30 minutes and was kneaded a few times. After this, the pulp was frozen and freeze-dried
before extraction and analysis.
DTPA and phosphate pre-treatments
5 mg/g of solid DTPA or solid phosphate were added to two different bags of 10 %
consistency pulp. The pulps were kneaded before the bags were immersed in a 60 °C
water bath for one hour and further kneaded for one minute every ten minutes while in
the warm water bath. After the pre-treatments, the pulps were frozen and freeze-dried.
3.2.3 Extraction, gravimetric determination and analysis of pulps
The extractions of the pulps were done either with ASE or with reflux.
The TDS (total dissolved solids) was determined gravimetrically for most samples. Every
extract was analysed with long and short column GC. Some samples were further
analysed with GC-MS. The analysis methods and the necessary preparations of the
samples are described below. Most analyses were done in triplicate, some in duplicate.
ASE extraction
ASE extraction was done with a Dionex™ ASE™ 200 Accelerated Solvent Extractor
system. The ASE was set to perform three 15-minute cycles under a pressure of 1500 psi
and using a temperature of 120 °C. Freeze-dried pulp was weighed into ASE cells, the
pulp was packed tightly with a rod and the rest of the cell volume was filled with clean
sand. After extraction, the extract was adjusted to 50 ml by evaporation under nitrogen
gas in a 40 °C water bath or by addition of acetone. The pulp was discarded and the sand
was recovered. The extracts were stored at +4 °C.
The pulps that were not pre-treated were extracted with a solvent mixture consisting of
acetone, water, and acetic acid in the ratio 95:4:1, termed acetic acid solvent. The acetic
acid solvent was also used for extraction of the pre-treated pulp that was acidified to pH 1,
the DTPA and phosphate pre-treated pulps, and the untreated pulp with additions to the
ASE cell. Phosphate and Smopex were used in separate ASE extractions as additions
directly to the cell. Additionally, the acetic acid solvent was used for extraction of the
outer and the inner parts of a pulp filter cake to see if there was a difference in the

Pinja Lillrank

Experimental

15

extractives depending on the part of the filter cake. The extract of the pre-treated pulp
acidified to pH 1 formed after drying a thick black precipitate, which could not be
properly silylated and therefore it was not analysed with GC. An additional extraction
with MTBE of this ASE extract was performed before silylation and analysis with GC.
The pulp that was not pre-treated was also extracted with a solvent consisting of acetone,
water and phosphoric acid in the ratio 95:4:1, termed phosphoric acid solvent. The extract
from this method also resulted in a thick black precipitate after drying, as described in the
previous paragraph, and had to be further MTBE extracted before it could be silylated
and analysed with GC.
In addition to being extracted with the acetic acid solvent, the pre-treated pulp acidified
to pH 1 was also extracted with a solvent mixture of cyclohexane and acetone in the ratio
9:1, termed cyclohexane solvent.
Sequential extraction, first with the cyclohexane solvent and then with the acetic acid
solvent, was done on the DTPA pre-treated pulp.
Reflux extraction
Two reflux extractions were done on the mill pulps, one with no additives and one with a
phosphate addition of 40 mg.
Anti-bumping granules were added to a round-bottom flask along with 1 g pulp. The same
was done for another round-bottomed flask, but with the addition of the phosphate. The
solvent was 50 ml of an acetone-water solution in the ratio 9:1 and the refluxing were
done for two hours in both cases. The extract was filtered on a Buchner funnel with a
glass fibre filter and the volume was adjusted to 100 ml by adding acetone. The extracts
were stored at +4 °C.
Gravimetric determination of TDS
The gravimetric determination was done on the ASE extracts of the pulps that were not
pre-treated and that were extracted by the acetic acid solvent. The gravimetric
determination started with drying and pre-weighing a test tube before adding 5 ml of the
sample. The sample was dried under nitrogen gas in a water bath of 40 °C, followed by
further drying in a 40 °C vacuum desiccator oven. When the sample was completely dry,

Pinja Lillrank

Experimental

16

the test tube was weighed, and the TDS was calculated from the difference in the mass of
the test tube with and without sample.
Silylation, GC and GC-MS analysis
For silylation, an aliquot of pulp extract was added to a test tube. The aliquot was 2–16 ml
depending on the concentration of the extract. Two millilitres of the internal standard
described in chapter 3.1 was added and the sample was dried under nitrogen gas in a 40 °C
water bath. In some cases, the samples were further dried in a vacuum desiccator oven to
ensure complete dryness. Two hundred microlitres of the silylation mixture, described in
chapter 3.1, was added to the dried samples and the samples were silylated at 70 °C for
45 minutes. The samples were agitated on a vortex mixer after the first 10 minutes in the
oven, again after the next 15 minutes, and one last time after 15 more minutes in the oven.
After the oven, the samples were moved to GC vials. The samples were analysed by long
column GC and by short column GC. Some samples were also analysed by GC-MS after
the GC analyses.
The long column GC was a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL with a column length of 25 m,
an inner diameter of 0.20 mm and a film thickness of 0.11 µm. The initial oven
temperature was 120 °C and the temperature increased by 6 °C/min until the temperature
was 300 °C. The injection temperature and detector temperature were 260 °C and 300 °C,
respectively.
The short column GC was a PerkinElmer Clarus 500. The column length was 6~7 m, the
inner diameter was 0.53 mm, and the film thickness was 0.15 µm. The injector
temperature was 80 °C and increased by 50 °C/min until the temperature was 110 °C.
After this, the temperature increased by 15 °C/min until it was 330 °C. The initial oven
temperature was 100 °C and increased by 12 °C/min until the final temperature of 340 °C
was reached. The detection temperature was 340 °C.
Additional extraction, silylation and GC analysis
The ASE extracts, which had been extracted with the phosphoric acid solvent, were
further liquid-liquid extracted with MTBE, as will be described in chapter 3.2.5. The same
procedure was done for the ASE extracts of pH 1 pre-treated pulp, which were extracted
with the acetic acid solvent. The extracts were silylated and analysed by GC.

Pinja Lillrank

17

The other extracts were just silylated and analysed by GC as described previously in this
chapter.
3.2.4 Pre-treatment of filtrates
The filtrates were pre-treated with DTPA or phosphate and acidified to pH 3.5, or directly
acidified to either pH 1 or pH 3.5.
Acidification
The filtrates were acidified to pH 1 or to pH 3.5 with sulphuric acid (H2SO4). An aliquot
of the filtrate was put into a screw-capped test tube and a pH indicator was added; for
pH 1 thymol blue was used and for pH 3.5 bromocresol green was used. Sulphuric acid
was added until the colour change was observed, and pH paper was used on some of the
samples to verify the pH.
Acidification and extraction were also done on a blank sample (distilled water) to make
sure that the acid in itself did not result in any peaks in the GC chromatograms.
DTPA and phosphate
The phosphate solution and the DTPA solution listed in chapter 3.1.3 were added to
separate aliquots of the filtrate. Half a millilitre of the filtrates, two millilitres of the DTPA
solution and one millilitre of the phosphate solution were used. One millilitre of water
was also added to the sample with phosphate solution. The samples were put in a 50 °C
oven for 30 minutes, after which they were acidified to pH 3.5 as described previously in
this chapter.
3.2.5 Extraction, gravimetric determination and analysis of filtrates
The extractions of the filtrates were done by liquid-liquid extraction with MTBE.
Gravimetric determination of TDS was done on some samples as described in chapter
3.2.3. Every extract was analysed with long and short column GC. Some samples were
further analysed with GC-MS. The extraction and analysis methods are described below.
Most analyses were done in duplicate.

Pinja Lillrank

Direct silylation and GC analysis
An aliquot of filtrate was put in a test tube, dried under nitrogen gas in a 40 °C water bath,
silylated and analysed with short and long column GC as described for the pulps. These
samples were neither pre-treated nor extracted.
Liquid-liquid extraction and GC analysis
Aliquots of the filtrate were pipetted into screw-capped test tubes and either pre-treated
according to the methods described in chapter 3.2.4 or extracted and analysed as such,
mainly according to Örså & Holmbom (1994). Two millilitres of the internal standard
described in chapter 3.1 was added to the samples. The test tubes were vigorously shaken
manually for one minute, after which they were left to stand so that phase separation
would occur. In the case that the top phase was an emulsion, the sample was carefully
shaken to break the emulsion and was put in a centrifuge for five minutes on 1300 rpm to
facilitate phase separation. The clear MTBE supernatant was moved to a separate test
tube. The second and third extractions on the same filtrate were done with 2 ml of pure
MTBE. After this, silylation and GC analysis was performed as described for the pulp.
Some samples were also analysed by GC-MS after the GC analyses.

3.3 Laboratory samples
3.3.1 Laboratory cooks
Six different cooks with carefully selected birch chips were done at VTT, Finland. The
black liquor from the cooking, the washed pulp, and the wash filtrate from each cook
were collected.
In table 3.1 the samples and treatments of chips are depicted. The chips for the RefLCa
(reference low calcium) and the SpiLCa (spiked low calcium) samples were soaked in
5 L of water with sulfuric acid at pH 2 at room temperature overnight before the cook to
wash out metal ions such as calcium. The chips for the rest of the cooks, RefNCa
(reference normal calcium), RefHCa (reference high calcium), SpiNCa (spiked normal
calcium) and SpiHCa (spiked high calcium), were soaked in 9 L of tap water at room
temperature overnight. All cooks were done in a 1 L vessel as a standard kraft cook
(2.5 mol effective alkali/kg, 40 % sulfidity, 5:1 liquid to wood ratio, 900 H-factor).
Calcium was added to the cooks of the RefHCa and SpiHCa samples in the form of

Pinja Lillrank

calcium chloride (CaCl2). Food grade sunflower oil and birch bark were added to the
spiked samples (SpiLCa, SpiNCa and SpiHCa).

Table 3.1. Treatments and names of the samples cooked at VTT, Finland. 100 g of chips
was used in every cook. The added calcium was anhydrous CaCl2, of which 2.77 g was
added.

3.3.2 Pre-treatment of pulps
The only pre-treatment that was done on the laboratory cooked pulps was the acidification
to pH 1. This was done as described in chapter 3.2.2.
3.3.3 Extraction, gravimetric determination and analysis of pulps
ASE extraction
Extraction with ASE was done with a Dionex™ ASE™ 300 Accelerated Solvent
Extractor system as described in chapter 3.2.3. Pulp with no pre-treatment was extracted
with the acetic acid solvent consisting of acetone, water and acetic acid in the ratio 95:4:1.
The pre-treated pulp was extracted with the cyclohexane solvent consisting of
cyclohexane and acetone in the ratio 9:1.

Reflux extraction
One reflux extraction was done on the laboratory pulps, as described in chapter 3.2.3,
with the exception that the amount of added phosphate was 100 mg and the extraction
continued for four hours.
Gravimetric determination of TDS
Gravimetric determination was done on all ASE pulp extracts as described in chapter
3.2.3.
Silylation, GC and GC-MS analysis
The silylation and analysis by GC was done in triplicate on all extracts as described in
chapter 3.2.3. Analysis by GC-MS was done on some of the samples.
3.3.4 Pre-treatment of wash filtrates
The acidification of the wash filtrates to pH 1 and to pH 3.5 was done in the same manner
as described in chapter 3.2.4.
3.3.5 Extraction, gravimetric determination and analysis of wash filtrates
Direct silylation and GC analysis
The direct silylation and subsequent analysis was done in triplicate on the laboratory wash
filtrates in the same manner as described for the mill filtrates in chapter 3.2.5.
Liquid-liquid extraction and GC analysis
The liquid-liquid extraction, silylation and GC analyses of the laboratory wash filtrates
were done in triplicate as described in chapter 3.2.5 for the mill filtrates.
Gravimetric determination of TDS
Gravimetric determination was done on all wash filtrates and wash filtrate extracts as
described in chapter 3.2.3.
3.3.6 Black liquor
The black liquor was diluted, extracted and analysed for extractives by Jarl Hemming at
the Laboratory of Natural Materials Technology according to the method developed by

Pinja Lillrank

Experimental

21

McGinnis (1998). The method for black liquor extraction and analysis is similar to the
method used for filtrates, which is described in chapter 3.2.5.
3.3.7 Miscellaneous
The birch chips used in the laboratory cooks were extracted by ASE using an acetonewater mixture in the ratio 95:5 at 100 °C and with three five-minute cycles. The ASE
extract was submitted to alkaline hydrolysis and analysed by GC. The birch bark added
to the spiked laboratory cooks was extracted by ASE and analysed by GC. The ASE
extraction was done sequentially, first with hexane at 90 °C with three five-minute cycles
and then with acetone-water in the ratio 95:5 using three five-minute cycles. The
sunflower oil added to the spiked samples was analysed by GC after alkaline hydrolysis.
The extractions and analyses of the birch chips, birch bark and sunflower oil were done
by Jarl Hemming at the Laboratory of Natural Materials Technology.
Additional analyses, as Kappa number and metal content, were done on the chips and the
pulps at Kemira R&D Center in Espoo Finland.

4 Results and discussion
This chapter will start with a discussion about the mill samples, after which the results of
the laboratory cooked samples will be presented and discussed. Several extraction
methods were tested and evaluated on the mill samples. Three of the methods for pulp
extraction and three of the methods for filtrate extraction were thereafter chosen to be
used on the laboratory cooked samples. The laboratory cooked samples were prepared
explicitly for this work to be used for evaluation of the analytical methods and to aid in
the final recommendation of extraction and analysis methods for unbleached birch kraft
pulps and filtrates, especially at high calcium levels.

4.1 Mill samples
4.1.1 Pulps
The results from the mill pulp extractions using different methods are shown in figure
4.1. The first four bars are the results from ASE extraction with the acetic acid solvent
(acetone:water:acetic acid 95:4:1), done on the same pulp sample, using 3x15 minute
cycles, 120 °C and 1500 psi. The first two bars (reference 1 and reference 2) show the
results of the same extraction method, where the pulp sample was taken at random from
the pulp filter cake. Even if the method was the same, the results were very different.
More extractives especially in the triterpenoids + squalene group and the prenols group
were found in reference 1. To investigate whether these differences were due to
differences in the contents of extractives between the outer part and the inner part of the
pulp filter cake, samples of these two regions of a filter cake were used for extraction with
the same method (the third and the fourth bar in figure 4.1). However, the content of
extractives in the inner part and in the outer part of the pulp filter cake was similar, which
means that there was some other reason to why the content of extractives differed between
reference 1 and reference 2. Possible reasons for the differences could be differing
contents of extractives in the top and bottom parts of the filter cake, which were not
evaluated separately, or contamination of the sample, the ASE apparatus or the GC
injector or column.

The fifth bar in figure 4.1 shows the results of ASE extraction with the phosphoric acid
solvent (acetone:water:phosphoric acid 95:4:1). The content of extractives was at the
same level as for ASE acetic acid reference 1 (see above), which was higher than the other
reference samples. These two extractions (bars one and five in figure 4.1) were done
before the rest, which might suggest that there was a similar problem with these two
samples. Possibly the samples, ASE apparatus or GC injector or column was
contaminated. The phosphoric acid method was somewhat problematic to perform. A

thick black precipitate was formed during drying of the extract in the silylation stage and
it took a very long time to dry completely. The resulting chromatogram had some strange
peaks (figure 4.2 a), so in order for silylation and GC-analysis to work, the ASE extract
needed to be liquid-liquid extracted with MTBE before silylation and GC analysis. A
chromatogram of the sample on which additional MTBE extraction was done, is seen in
figure 4.2 b.

Pinja Lillrank

25

two methods gave similar results when compared with each other and when compared to
ASE acetic acid reference 2. With the addition of phosphate, slightly more prenols were
extracted. Phosphate has previously been used as an addition to acetone when extracting
calcium soaps of fatty acids from pulp samples (Holmbom & Stenius, 2000).
The eight bar in figure 4.1 shows the results of the reflux extraction and the ninth bar
shows the results of the reflux extraction with added phosphate. The results from both
reflux extractions were similar, and the content of extractives was also on similar levels
as for ASE acetic acid reference 2.
The tenth bar in figure 4.1 shows the results of ASE with the acetic acid solvent on pulp
that was pre-treated with DTPA and the eleventh bar shows the results of ASE with the
acetic acid solvent on pulp that was pre-treated with phosphate. The results of these two
extractions were similar to each other and to ASE acetic acid reference 2. DTPA was used
because it is a chelating agent that should bind metal ions such as calcium ions, and thus
render them less problematic (Alén, 2011b).
The twelfth bar in figure 4.1 shows the results of ASE with the acetic acid solvent on pulp
that was pre-treated to pH 1. The total content of extractives was similar to ASE acetic
acid reference 2. There were, however, some differences in the contents of the different
groups of extractives. More fatty acids were detected with this method, and less prenols
and triterpenoids + squalene. Bergelin et al. (2003) also found that acidifying unbleached
birch pulp to a pH of 2.1–2.5 with phosphoric acid and pH 2.8–3.0 with acetic acid
resulted in the extraction of more fatty acids. Their explanation was that fatty acids were
extracted more easily due to the fatty acid metal soaps being in their acid forms. Another
possibility is that some sugars, released from oligo- and polysaccharides during the
treatment at pH 1, were wrongly identified as fatty acids in the GC chromatograms. The
extraction of the pulp that was pre-treated to pH 1 was problematic. A thick black
precipitate was formed during drying in the silylation stage and it took very long to dry
the sample completely. The black precipitate looked visually similar to the extract of the
pulp sample that was extracted with phosphoric acid when it was dried during silylation,
and since the resulting chromatogram from that extraction was difficult to interpret, this
sample was not analysed by GC. Instead, the ASE extract was further extracted with
MTBE before it was silylated and analysed by GC.

Bar thirteen in figure 4.1 shows the extraction of the pH 1 pre-treated pulp with
cyclohexane. This solvent was used in order to extract the extractives more selectively
than the acetic acid solvent and avoid simultaneous extraction of sugars and lignin
fragments. However, the total content of detected extractives was lower with this method,
especially the triterpenoids + squalene, while the content of fatty acids was similar to that
of ASE acetic acid reference 2.
Bars fourteen and fifteen in figure 4.1 show the results of sequential ASE extraction on
the same aliquot of pulp that was pre-treated with DTPA. The first of these two bars shows
the results of extraction with the cyclohexane solvent and the second of the bars shows
the results of the following extraction with the acetic acid solvent. The sum of these two
bars is shown in the next bar (sixteenth bar in figure 4.1). The extraction with cyclohexane
solvent on the DTPA pre-treated pulp yielded significantly less extractives than extraction
with the cyclohexane solvent on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp. This implies that the pretreatment at pH 1 released more fatty acids, perhaps occurring as metal soaps or as esters.
The sum of the content of extractives from the sequential extraction was lower than the
content of extractives in ASE acetic acid reference 2 and in DTPA pre-treated pulp that
was extracted only with the acetic acid solvent. This method was less efficient at
extracting and it required more work than the other methods. Sequential extraction with
ASE has previously been reported by for example Conde et al. (2014).
In a previous work (Bergelin, et al., 2003), extraction with ASE using acetone or hexane
as solvent was shown to be slightly more efficient on unbleached birch pulp than the other
methods used in their work, which were Soxhlet, Soxtec, reflux, reflux with excess
KH2PO4 and ultra-sonic extraction. For bleached birch pulp, reflux with an excess of
KH2PO4 was the most efficient extraction method.
Regarding the solvents that were used, acetone was efficient at extracting components
because it can easily penetrate the cell wall into the cell, where the extractives are located,
due to its high dielectric constant (20.7) (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000). However, acetone
was not very specific at extracting the desired components, and also extracted sugars and
lignans, which made the chromatograms harder to interpret. The reason for this is the high
polarity of acetone, the polarity index being 5.1. Cyclohexane is a more specific solvent
due to its low polarity. The polarity index of cyclohexane is only 0.2. Cyclohexane,
however, was not as efficient at extracting the whole content of extractives, its dielectric
constant being only 2.0, so some of the desired extractives are bound to be left inside the

wood cells if cyclohexane is used on its own. To increase the extraction power of
cyclohexane, some acetone was added to the solvent mixture so that one tenth was
acetone. According to Snyder (1974), a mixture of a polar solvent and a nonpolar solvent
largely maintains the extraction power of the polar solvent. When comparing bars twelve
and thirteen in figure 4.1, this seems to make sense: the extraction with the acetic acid
solvent on pH 1 pre-treated pulp extracted more fatty acids than the other methods, but
when the cyclohexane solvent was used on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp, the content of
observed fatty acids was about the same as with the other methods, suggesting that there
were impurities that eluted at the same time with fatty acids when the acetic acid solvent
was used. The cyclohexane solvent extracted less of the other groups than the other
solvents, which was probably due to the specific extraction properties of cyclohexane.
The results of the pH 1 pre-treated pulp differed from the results obtained from the DTPA
pre-treated pulp. The determined extractives in the DTPA pre-treated pulp were on the
same level as with the other methods when the acetic acid solvent was used, but the
cyclohexane solvent extracted significantly less. It would be unlikely that the pulp had
such a high content of impurities that the real content of extractives was depicted by the
content obtained with the cyclohexane extraction of the DTPA pre-treated pulp. Maybe
the high pH of the DTPA pulp had an effect on the extraction capacity of the cyclohexane
solvent. Not even when the DTPA pre-treated pulp was extracted with the acetic acid
solvent after being extracted with the cyclohexane solvent did the content of detected
extractives equal the content of extractives when only the acetic acid solvent was used on
the DTPA pre-treated pulp. The SCAN-CM 49:03 standard states that a higher content of
extractives can be detected with acetone if the pulp is acidified to a pH below 3 prior to
extraction. This could explain the differences in the content of extractives found in the
pulp acidified to pH 1 and the pulp that was pre-treated with DTPA when the cyclohexane
solvent was used. Some differences in the content of extractives were observed between
the different groups of extractives when the acetic acid solvent was used and when the
cyclohexane solvent was used. Below pH 3, the fatty acid sodium soaps become
protonated, and hence they are more easily extracted. Fatty acid calcium soaps need a
more rigorous acidification in order for them to be fully extractable. (SCAN-CM 49:03)
The SCAN-CM 49:03 standard presents a method that acidifies the pulp with acetic acid
prior to extraction. The standard states that this method is not sufficient for fatty acid
calcium soaps. Bergelin et al. (2003) used the acidification method described in the

Pinja Lillrank

28

SCAN-CM 49 standard with acetic acid. They also used the same method but substituted
the acetic acid with phosphoric acid and obtained somewhat more acidic pulp (pH 2.8–
3.0 with the acetic acid and pH 2.1–2.5 with the phosphoric acid). These two acids were
also used in this work. However, according to the standard SCAN-CM 49:03 method, the
acidification with the acetic acid should be done prior to extraction. In this work the acid
was simply added to the extraction solvent to save time. Fardim et al. (2005) used a
mixture of acetone and acetic acid as a solvent for extracting pulp samples. However, they
used the reflux method and a larger proportion of acetic acid than was used in this work,
and the results they obtained were similar to those when using only acetone as the
extraction solvent. The samples that were used by Fardim et al. (2005) were also different
from the samples used in this work. Whereas they used bleached kraft pulp and recycled
deinked pulp, the samples in this work were unbleached kraft pulp. Results obtained by
Bergelin et al. (2003) show that different methods might have different advantages
depending on whether the sample used is bleached or unbleached, so the results obtained
by Fardim et al. (2005) cannot directly be used as a reference for the results in this work,
but their research shows that a mixture of acetone and acetic acid has been used for
extraction previously.
When optimizing the analytical methods, simplicity and as few steps as possible are
desired characteristics while maintaining good results. Based on the results in figure 4.1
and previous results (Bergelin, et al., 2003), three methods were chosen for further testing
with the laboratory pulp samples:
1. ASE with the acetic acid solvent. The method is simple, no pre-treatment of the
pulp and no additions to the ASE cell are needed. Based on the results in figure
4.1, this method is also at least as effective at extracting as the other methods.
2. Reflux with addition of phosphate. This is an easy method and no ASE equipment
is needed.
3. ASE extraction with the cyclohexane solvent on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp. ASE
with the acetic acid solvent on pH 1 pre-treated pulp gave the highest content of
fatty acids of all the methods, but the extraction with the cyclohexane solvent gave
a chromatogram that was easier to interpret.

4.1.2 Filtrates
The results of the six methods that were used on the mill filtrates are found in figure 4.3.
When the filtrate was extracted without pH adjustment, the concentration of extractives
was much lower than when the extract was acidified to pH 3.5. Slightly higher
concentrations were obtained when the extract was acidified to pH 1, compared to pH 3.5.
The largest difference was found for the fatty acids. They are largely deprotonated at high
pH, which means that they dissolve in water (Allen, 2000; Sundberg, et al., 2009). In
order to increase their solubility in MTBE and thereby their extractability, the filtrate
needs to be acidified.

and six).

Slightly more fatty acids were detected with direct silylation (bar four in figure 4.3) than
when the filtrate was acidified and liquid-liquid extracted (bars two and three in figure
4.3). Comparing these methods, the biggest difference in the concentration of extractives

Pinja Lillrank

Results and discussion

30

was that no prenols were found after direct silylation. Direct silylation seemed to work
well for analysing fatty acids, but not for analysing prenols. There might have been a
problem with the silylation in the case that other compounds were silylated before prenols,
and thus the silylation reagents would be used up before everything was silylated. The
high concentration of identified compounds, however, suggests that this was not the
problem. Another, more likely, explanation could be that the chromatograms of the
directly silylated samples had so many peaks of degradation products that the prenols
could not be properly identified among them.
The concentration of extractives found with the pre-treatment methods and subsequent
acidification to pH 3.5 (bars five and six in figure 4.3) were similar to those found in the
sample that was just acidified to pH 3.5, meaning that the extra work done for the pretreatment methods was unnecessary.
Liquid-liquid extraction with MTBE on process waters acidified to pH 3.5 is, according
to Valto et al. (2012), the most common extraction technique for process waters and
effluents, and in combination with GC analysis it is the most accurate technique. The
method was presented by Örså & Holmbom (1994).
The methods chosen for the filtrates based on the same criteria as for the pulps were:
1. Acidification to pH 3.5. This is the current standard method, and it extracted as
much as the pre-treatment methods but without the extra steps.
2. Acidification to pH 1. This method resulted in the highest concentration of
extractives based on the results in figure 4.3.
3. Direct silylation. This is the easiest method and it gave similar results as the
standard method of acidification to pH 3.5.

4.2 Extractives in chips, oil and bark used in laboratory samples
In this chapter, the raw materials used in the laboratory cooks will be described, starting
with the acid-soaked and water-soaked birch chips, continuing to sunflower oil, and
finishing with birch bark. After this, the analytical methods for pulps and filtrates will be
discussed, as well as the extractives found in the washed pulp, black liquor and wash
filtrate.

4.2.1 Extractives in birch chips
The extractives in the acid-soaked and water-soaked chips were analysed by extracting
the chips with ASE using acetone-water in the ratio 95:5, submitting the extract to alkaline
hydrolysis and determining the extractives with GC. In figure 4.4, it can be seen that more
fatty acids were found in the acid-soaked chips than in the water-soaked chips. The largest
difference was in the content of acid 18:2. According to findings by Piispanen & Saranpää
(2004), the average content of acid 18:2 in silver birch stem wood is 5.5 mg/g wood,
which is significantly higher than what was found in the acid-soaked chips (2.1 mg/g
chips), which had a higher content of detected fatty acids than the water-soaked chips, as
can be seen in figure 4.4. The analysis methods used by Piispanen & Saranpää (2004) and
in this work differed, which may account for some of the differences. The species of birch
might have been different, as well as the geographical location of the birch used, which
might affect the content of acid 18:2 (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).

Pinja Lillrank

explanation to the differing content of extractives found in the different chips could be
that the acid-soaked chips were contaminated. Alternatively, the acid soaking might have
affected extractability of the unsaturated fatty acids. Another explanation could be that
the acid soaking released fatty acids from metal ion soaps or other types of aggregates.
According to Sundberg et al. (2009), unsaturated fatty acids are generally more soluble
in water at neutral pH values than saturated fatty acids, and therefore a plausible
explanation for the different content of unsaturated fatty acids between the chips would
be that a portion of the unsaturated fatty acids were removed from the chips when they
were soaked in water.
For both prenols shown in figure 4.5, the content was higher in the acid-soaked chips than
in the water-soaked chips. The acid-soaking could have increased the extractability of
prenols, or of other compounds that elute in the same region as the prenols in the gas
chromatogram. Another possibility is that the water-soaking released some prenols,
thereby removing them before the chips were analysed.

Figure 4.6 shows that more triterpenoids + squalene were extracted from acid-soaked

Pinja Lillrank

33

sitosterol with a difference of 0.16 mg/g. For betulinol, there was almost no difference
between the chips. The total content of betulinol was significantly lower than the content
of the other extractives in this group. According to theory, betulinol is located in the bark
of birch and none is present in the wood, but the bark is hard to remove completely so
traces of bark might have been present in the analyses (Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).
Piispanen & Saranpää (2004) found a similar content of citrostadienol in birch wood
(0.39 mg/g) as was found in the acid-soaked chips in this work (0.41 mg/g). They found
slightly more squalene (0.48 mg/g) in birch wood than what was found in the acid-soaked
chips in this work (0.31 mg/g) and almost double the content of sitosterol (0.81 mg/g) and
sitostanol (0.27 mg/g) compared to the acid-soaked chips in this work (0.49 mg/g and
0.14 mg/g). The content of cycloartenol and methylene cycloartanol that Piispanen &
Saranpää (2004) found in birch wood was similar to that found in the acid-soaked chips
in this work, but the content of 7-prenol was more similar to that found in the watersoaked chips in this work.

between extractives and other compounds, or that the acid-soaked chips were
contaminated. Another explanation could be that the chips used in acid-soaking were
different from the ones used in water-soaking even though they were carefully selected.
Yet another possibility is that extractives were removed with the water-soaking but not
with the acid-soaking.
The content of calcium in the water-soaked chips was measured to be 650 mg/kg and in
the acid-soaked chips it was measured to be 300 mg/kg. This shows that the acid soaking
was an efficient way to decrease the content of calcium in the birch chips. A table of the
contents of other metals present in the chips can be found in appendix A2.
4.2.2 Extractives in sunflower oil
The concentrations of extractives in the food grade sunflower oil were determined after
alkaline hydrolysis and are seen in figure 4.7. The most abundant fatty acids were acid
18:2 and 18:1(9).

Pinja Lillrank

35

and low linoleic – high oleic. The sunflower oil used in this work seemed to be of the
high linoleic – low oleic type, 53.4 % of the sunflower oil consisting of acid 18:2 and
30.2 % consisting of acid 18:1. The high linoleic – low oleic sunflower oils that
Chowdhury et al. (2007) analysed consisted of 61.2 % or 66.6 % acid 18:2 and 27.8 % or
22.8 % acid 18:1. The average concentration of other fatty acids in the samples analysed
by Chowdhury et al. (2007) were 6.5 % of acid 16:0, 2.0 % of acid 18:0 and 0.1 % of
acid 18:3. The corresponding concentrations of the fatty acids found in the sunflower oil
sample used in this work were 5.8 % for acid 16:0 and 3.6 % for acid 18:0, while
acid 18:3 was not detected at all. In addition, minor concentrations of other fatty acids
were detected in the sunflower oil sample used in this work, a table of all detected
components is found in Appendix A3. Overall, the concentration of the fatty acid
components in the sunflower oil used in this work seem to be on the same level as those
found by Chowdhury et al. (2007).
4.2.3 Extractives in birch bark
The extractives in birch bark were determined by sequential ASE, first with hexane and
then with acetone-water in the ratio 95:5. In figure 4.8 it can be seen that most of the
extractives in the bark was betulinol, which is in accordance with the literature
(Holmbom, 2011). Of the total content of extractives found in the birch bark, 90 % was
betulinol. This was a higher percentage than the literature gives, i.e., 75–85 % (Back,
2000b; Holmbom, 2011), which might be due to the specific selection of predominantly
the white parts of the bark to be analysed in this work. Some lupeol was also detected.
Rizhikovs et al. (2015) also stated that birch bark consists mainly of betulinol and lupeol.
Tiny contents of other triterpenoids were also detected, a table of these can be found in
appendix A3.

4.3 Pulp from laboratory cooks
The metal content and other properties of the pulps will be discussed first, then the
extractive content in the pulps will be discussed.
4.3.1 Metal content and other properties of the pulps
A picture of the pulps from the laboratory cooks is shown in figure 4.9. The pulps from
the cooks with added calcium, i.e., RefHCa and SpiHCa, are much darker than the other
pulps. These observations were confirmed by the brightness values, as can be seen in table
4.1. The Kappa numbers were also highest for the samples with a high calcium content,
suggesting that a high calcium content during the cook decreases washing efficiency,
resulting in more residual lignin remaining in the pulp. According to Back (2000a), pulp
with a lower Kappa number usually contains less extractives than pulp with a high Kappa
number.

The content of calcium in the pulp samples was different depending on if the birch chips
were acid-soaked or water-soaked prior to cooking and if calcium was added to the cooks.
The acid-soaked chips contained 300 mg/kg calcium, less than half the content in the
water-soaked chips, which contained 650 mg/kg calcium, as can be seen in table 4.1. It
was therefore clear that the acid-soaking removed some of the calcium from the chips.
According to Alén (2000b), the content of calcium in wood is 400–1000 mg/kg.
The lowest calcium contents were found in the pulps that had been cooked using the acidsoaked chips. As shown in table 4.1, RefLCa contained 170 mg/kg calcium and SpiLCa
contained 190 mg/kg calcium. These contents of calcium were lower than in the acidsoaked chips, resulting in the conclusion that some of the calcium was removed with the

Pinja Lillrank

38

black liquor or the wash filtrate. The calcium content in the pulps using water-soaked
chips was between 410 mg/kg and 450 mg/kg. The pulps from the cooks with added
calcium had the highest contents of calcium: 5700 mg/kg for RefHCa and 4900 mg/kg
for SpiHCa. One gram of calcium was added to these cooks, so the content of calcium
should be 10 000 mg/kg higher in these pulps than in the pulps cooked without added
calcium. This was, however, not the case, further suggesting that much of the calcium
was removed with the black liquor or washed out with the wash filtrate.
4.3.2 Extractives content in pulps
In this chapter, the three analytical methods that were selected based on the results from
the mill samples are compared and evaluated. The pulp samples will have different
contents of extractives depending on the chips used and the additions made to the cooks.
For RefLCa (i.e., acid-soaked chips), ASE with the acetic acid solvent and reflux with
added phosphate extracted very similar contents of all groups of extractives, as can be
seen in the first group of bars in figure 4.10. ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp with the
cyclohexane solvent extracted as much fatty acids as the two other methods, but much
less of the other groups of extractives, especially triterpenoids + squalene. ASE on pH 1
pre-treated pulp extracted some fatty alcohols, while no fatty alcohols were extracted with
the other two methods. As for the degraded fatty acids, ASE with the acetic acid solvent
and reflux with added phosphate extracted small contents, but no degraded fatty acids
could be detected with ASE on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp.
For RefNCa (i.e., water-soaked chips), as for RefLCa (i.e., acid-soaked chips), ASE with
the acetic acid solvent and reflux with added phosphate resulted in similar contents of
detected extractives in all groups of extractives, as can be seen in the second group of bars
in figure 4.10. The ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp with the cyclohexane solvent extracted
slightly less triterpenoids + squalene as well as prenols, but the differences were smaller
than in RefLCa. With ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp, some fatty alcohols but no degraded
fatty acids were extracted. With the other two methods no fatty alcohols and some
degraded fatty acids were extracted.
For RefHCa (i.e., added calcium) the results obtained with the different methods varied
more than for the other reference samples. Reflux with added phosphate extracted the
most, as can be seen in the third group of bars in figure 4.10. ASE with the acetic acid
solvent extracted somewhat less, especially from the group triterpenoids + squalene. ASE

on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp with the cyclohexane solvent extracted remarkably less than
the two other methods, however, a similar content of fatty acids was detected with all
three methods. ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp extracted some fatty alcohols, while no fatty
alcohols were extracted with the other two methods. Both ASE with the acetic acid
solvent and reflux with added phosphate extracted some degraded fatty acids, while none
were detected with ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp.

In SpiLCa (i.e., added extractives, acid-soaked chips), similar contents of extractives were
detected with ASE with the acetic acid solvent and reflux with added phosphate, as can
be seen in the fourth group of bars in figure 4.10. There was a slight difference in the
content of extractives in the different groups; ASE with the acetic acid solvent extracted
somewhat more fatty acids and somewhat less triterpenoids + squalene than reflux with
added phosphate. ASE on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp extracted a similar content of fatty
acids as the other two methods, but significantly less triterpenoids + squalene. Fatty
alcohols were extracted with all three methods, slightly less with ASE on pH 1 pre-treated
pulp than with the other two methods. Degraded fatty acids were not detected with ASE
on pH 1 pre-treated pulp, but a small content was detected with the other two methods.
ASE with the acetic acid solvent and reflux with added phosphate extracted similar
contents of extractives from SpiNCa (i.e., added extractives, water-soaked chips), reflux
with added phosphate extracting slightly more fatty acids, triterpenoids + squalene and
prenols, as can be seen in the fifth group of bars in figure 4.10. ASE on the pH 1 pretreated pulp was less efficient at extracting, with this method a smaller content of
extractives was detected in all groups except for the fatty acids, of which a similar content
was detected as with the other two methods.
For SpiHCa (i.e., added extractives, added calcium), ASE with the acetic acid solvent
detected a somewhat higher content of extractives than reflux with added phosphate, as
can be seen in the sixth group of bars in figure 4.10. The difference was notable for the
fatty acids. With ASE on the pH 1 pre-treated pulp, less than half of the content was
detected than with the other two methods.
For all samples, ASE with the cyclohexane solvent on pH 1 pre-treated pulp detected the
smallest content of extractives. This might be because cyclohexane is a very selective
solvent. Another thing that might affect the results was the acidification to pH 1, which
is very harsh; cellulose and possibly other components present start to degrade at the
highly acidic conditions. ASE with the acetic acid solvent and reflux with added
phosphate seem to have had similar extraction capacity for all samples.
Similar contents of extractives were detected in the two pulp samples with low calcium
content, see RefLCa and SpiLCa in figure 4.10. This suggests that the washing efficiency
was maintained when the calcium content was low, even if the content of fatty acids and
betulinol was much higher in the spiked cook. Somewhat more extractives were detected

Pinja Lillrank

41

in the spiked sample with a normal content of calcium than in the reference sample with
a normal content of calcium, which suggests that the washing efficiency decreased
slightly when the content of calcium was normal, see RefNCa and SpiNCa in figure 4.10.
A notably higher content of extractives was detected in the spiked sample with a high
content of calcium than in the reference sample with a high content of calcium, suggesting
that with a high calcium content, the washing efficiency decreased significantly, see
RefHCa and SpiHCa in figure 4.10. These findings are in line with theory (Bergelin,
2008), which states that when the content of calcium is high, the washing efficiency
decreases, and extractives are retained in the pulp to a higher degree than with lower
contents of calcium.
The fatty acid fraction was the largest extractives fraction in all samples and with all
methods (figure 4.10). With a high content of calcium, more of the fatty acids should be
retained in the pulp (Bergelin, 2008). This could clearly be seen in the SpiHCa sample.
Perhaps there has to be a high excess of fatty acids for this to be observable, as in the
SpiHCa sample, or perhaps the calcium content was so low in the SpiNCa sample that it
did not have a clear effect.
Triterpenoids + squalene was the second biggest group in all samples, but the content
varied more between methods and samples than the content of fatty acids. ASE extraction
on the pH 1 acidified pulp with the cyclohexane solvent could apparently not extract this
group of extractives as efficiently as the other methods.
Fatty alcohols were only present in some of the extractions of the spiked samples. The
high content of added fatty acids might have contributed to fatty alcohols being produced
in the cooks in such quantities that they could be extracted and detected. Both fatty acids
and fatty alcohols were mostly found in the SpiHCa sample.
Degraded fatty acids could be observed in all pulps with both ASE with the acetic acid
solvent and with reflux with added phosphate. Degraded fatty acids could only be detected
in trace amounts when ASE on pH 1 pre-treated pulp was used.
Prenols was a minor group in all pulp samples with all methods. ASE on the pH 1 pretreated pulp with the cyclohexane solvent was least efficient at extracting prenols from
all pulps.

4.4 Wash filtrate from laboratory cooks
In this chapter, the three analytical methods selected based on the results from the mill
samples are compared and evaluated. As with the pulp samples, the wash filtrate samples
will have different contents of extractives depending on the chips used and the additions
made to the cooks.
4.4.1 Extractives content in wash filtrates
For RefLCa, similar contents of extractives were detected with the acidification to pH 3.5
and the acidification to pH 1, slightly more being detected with the pH 1 treatment, as can
be seen in the first group of bars in figure 4.11. Out of the three methods, the highest
content of extractives was detected with the direct silylation, especially of the fatty acids.
The pre-treatment to pH 3.5 resulted in the highest content of detected degraded fatty
acids. A small content (0.01–0.02 mg/g) of fatty alcohols were detected in the extracts of
the samples that were acidified to pH 3.5 and pH 1, but none were detected by direct
silylation.
The acidification to pH 3.5 and the acidification to pH 1 resulted in similar contents of
detected extractives in the RefNCa sample, the acidification to pH 1 detecting slightly
more, especially of the fatty acids, as can be seen in the second group of bars in figure
4.11. The direct silylation resulted in more detected extractives than the other two
methods, most notably extractives in the groups triterpenoids + squalene and fatty acids.
The acidification to pH 3.5 resulted in more degraded fatty acids than the other methods.
A small content (0.02 mg/g) of fatty alcohols was detected in the extracts of the samples
that were acidified to pH 3.5 and pH 1, but none were detected in the analysis of the
directly silylated sample.
In the RefHCa sample, similar contents of total extractives were detected with the
acidifications to pH 3.5 and pH 1, more degraded fatty acids being detected in the sample
acidified to pH 3.5, as can be seen in the third group of bars in figure 4.11. More
extractives were detected with the direct silylation than with the other two methods,
especially fatty acids and triterpenoids + squalene. Small contents (0.01–0.02 mg/g) of
fatty alcohols were detected in the extracts of the samples that were acidified to pH 3.5
and pH 1, but none were detected in the analysis of the directly silylated sample.

Figure 4.11. Detected contents of groups of extractives in each laboratory wash filtrate
sample and with each method. pH 3.5 shows the method where the wash filtrate was
acidified to pH 3.5, pH 1 shows the method where the wash filtrate was acidified to pH 1,

and analysed. RefLCa = reference low calcium, RefNCa = reference normal calcium,
RefHCa = reference high calcium, SpiLCa = spiked low calcium, SpiNCa = spiked
normal calcium, SpiHCa = spiked high calcium.

For the SpiLCa sample, the acidification to pH 3.5 and the direct silylation resulted in
similar contents of detected extractives, as can be seen in the fourth group of bars in figure
4.11. With the acidification to pH 1, more extractives were detected than with the other
two methods, especially more fatty acids. The acidification to pH 3.5 resulted in more
detected degraded fatty acids than the other two methods.
For SpiNCa, similar contents of extractives were detected with all methods, as can be
seen in the fifth group of bars in figure 4.11. The acidification to pH 3.5 resulted in more
detected degraded fatty acids, while the direct silylation resulted in more detected
triterpenoids + squalene and slightly less detected fatty acids than the other two methods.

For the SpiHCa sample, the acidification to pH 1 resulted in a smaller content of detected
extractives than the other two methods and the direct silylation resulted in a higher content
of detected extractives than the other two methods, as can be seen in the sixth group of
bars in figure 4.11. The direct silylation resulted in more triterpenoids + squalene and less
degraded fatty acids than the other two methods.
The results are possibly skewed because the chromatograms from the direct silylation
were more difficult to interpret than the chromatograms from the other two methods.
Other compounds may have eluted at the same time as the identified compounds,
especially in the region of the fatty acids.
The fatty acids was the largest group of detected extractives in each sample (figure 4.11).
The second largest group in all samples was triterpenoids + squalene. These were also the
two largest groups extracted from the pulp samples. The extractives groups of which
higher contents of extractives were found in the spiked samples compared to the reference
samples were primarily fatty acids, followed by triterpenoids + squalene, as well as fatty
alcohols. Fatty alcohols were not found in the sunflower oil that was used for spiking
(figure 4.7), so these compounds were probably the result of reactions taking place during
the cook. Some fatty alcohols were detected in the spiked pulp samples, but the content
was much higher in the spiked wash filtrates.
The content of extractives in the wash filtrate decreased with increasing calcium content.
This was mostly notable for the fatty acids, and in the spiked samples the trend could also
be observed for the group triterpenoids + squalene. According to theory, calcium forms
soaps with fatty acids, which are retained in the pulp to a high extent (Ekman &
Holmbom, 2000; Bergelin, 2008). Therefore, when there was less calcium present, the
fatty acids were washed out with the wash filtrate (and black liquor) and did not remain
in the pulp, as seen in figure 4.10.

4.5 Extractives content in black liquor from the laboratory cooks
The content of detected extractives in black liquor, seen in figure 4.12, was small for all
the reference samples (0.51–0.67 mg/g).
For the spiked samples, the content of detected extractives increased linearly with an
increasing content of calcium, as can be seen in figure 4.12. The fatty acids mostly
followed the linear trend, but the other extractives groups did not. The content of

triterpenoids + squalene increased with increasing contents of calcium, but the content of
degraded fatty acids was fairly constant (±0.01 mg/g) and the content of prenols was
smaller when the content of calcium was high.

4.6 Overview of the results
In figure 4.13 the total content of extractives found in pulp, black liquor and wash filtrate
from each cook are shown, as well as the total content of extractives from the raw
materials (acid-soaked and water-soaked chips, sunflower oil and birch bark). The
extraction methods used on the samples were ASE with the acetic acid solvent on the
pulp, and acidification to pH 3.5 on the wash filtrate, since these methods generally
yielded the highest contents of extractives and were easy to perform.
The bar with the acid-soaked chips, the sunflower oil and the bark corresponds to the
samples with low content of calcium (LCa), and the bar with water-soaked chips,
sunflower oil and bark corresponds to the samples with normal and high content of
calcium (NCa and HCa). The detected content of extractives in RefLCa should be equal
to the detected content of extractives in the acid-soaked chips, because all the chips that
were added into the cook were removed as pulp, black liquor and wash filtrate after the
cook. The total content of extractives in the RefLCa samples was 3.7 mg/g chips, and the
content of extractives in the acid-soaked chips was 7.6 mg/g. This would indicate a loss

Pinja Lillrank

Results and discussion

46

of extractives, which was expected to happen to some extent due to losses when extracting
and analysing, but these losses would be minor. There was also some degradation of
extractives in the cook, which probably accounts for some decrease in extractives.
Another explanation could be that the extraction was easier on the chips than on the pulp,
black liquor and wash filtrate, and thus a lower content was detected in the different
fractions than in the chips. Yet another explanation could be that the extractives reacted
during the cook and formed other compounds that could not be extracted or were not
identified in the analysis. The extractives that were included in figure 4.13, were only
ones that were detected both in the raw materials (chips, oil and bark) and in the pulp,
black liquor and wash filtrate. When comparing the total content of extractives (all
identified and unidentified compounds) for the RefLCa sample to the content of
extractives in the acid-soaked chips (only the identified compounds in the chips), the
content was higher for the RefLCa sample (9.1 mg/g in RefLCa vs 7.6 mg/g in the acidsoaked chips). This would suggest that the extractives in the chips reacted in the cook into
other compounds that were not taken into consideration in the analyses. However, some
of the unidentified peaks also originated from carbohydrates and lignin fragments.
Like the content of extractives in the acid-soaked chips should be the same as in the pulp,
black liquor and wash filtrate of the RefLCa sample, the content of extractives in the
water-soaked chips should be equal to the content of extractives in the pulp, black liquor
and wash filtrate of the RefNCa and the RefHCa samples. The difference between the
samples and the water-soaked chips was lower than with RefLCa and the acid-soaked
chips. The total content of extractives in RefNCa was 3.0 mg/g, in RefHCa it was
3.3 mg/g and in the water-soaked chips it was 4.5 mg/g, so there was only a 1.2–1.5 mg/g
difference between the content of detected extractives in the water-soaked chips and in
the samples that these chips were used for. The total content (also unidentified peaks) of
compounds detected by GC in the RefNCa sample was 6.8 mg/g and in the RefHCa
sample it was 8.8 mg/g. Both when the unidentified extractives were taken into account
and when they were not taken into account, more extractives were found in the sample
with the higher content of calcium than in the sample with the normal content of calcium.

raw materials: chips, both acid-soaked and water-soaked, as well as sunflower oil and

the acid-soaked chips and in the water-soaked chips differed, hence the two bars depicting
the content of extractives in chips, with the sunflower oil and birch bark added on top.

The same way as the extractives in the chips should correlate with the extractives in all
the fractions of the reference samples, the total content of extractives in the chips,
sunflower oil and birch bark should be equal to the total content of extractives in the pulp,
black liquor and wash filtrate of the spiked samples in figure 4.13. The biggest difference
between the content of extractives in the raw materials and in the sample fractions was
between the acid-soaked chips and SpiLCa, as with the reference samples. There was also
a notable difference between the extractives in the water-soaked chips plus additions, and

Pinja Lillrank

SpiNCa and SpiHCa, but not as big as between the acid-soaked chips and SpiLCa. The
reasons could be the same as discussed previously, in other words losses during extraction
and analysis, degradation or modification of the extractives during the cook, or
contamination of the acid-soaked chips. During the cooking procedure, the SpiLCa
sample foamed more than the other samples, and some of the foam wound up in the
suction flask, i.e., in the black liquor, and was removed. This is the most plausible reason
for the bigger difference in the content of detected extractives between the acid-soaked
chips plus additions and SpiLCa.
Similar contents of extractives were detected in all reference samples, slightly more being
detected in the sample with the low calcium content (RefLCa). This was to be expected,
since RefLCa was cooked from the acid-soaked chips, in which more extractives were
detected than in the water-soaked chips. In all reference samples, most of the extractives
were found in the pulp fraction, followed by the wash filtrate. At high calcium content
(RefHCa), slightly more extractives were found in the pulp fraction than at normal
calcium content (RefNCa). In table 4.1 it was also shown that the Kappa number increased
and the brightness decreased at high calcium levels, implying that the washing efficiency
was lower when the calcium content was high.
Similar contents of extractives were found in the pulp fractions of SpiLCa and SpiNCa,
implying that a low to moderate content of calcium did not significantly affect the
washing. Less extractives were found in the black liquor in SpiLCa than in SpiNCa. The
accidental removal of some of the foam from the SpiLCa cook could explain the lower
content of extractives in the black liquor. The foam could also have been precipitated in
the digester, explaining the lower total content of extractives. A low content of calcium
in combination with a high content of fatty acids may also have changed the interactions
in the black liquor and the extractability. The content of extractives was significantly
higher in the pulp and black liquor fractions and significantly lower in the wash filtrate
fraction at high levels of calcium. This was because the calcium soaps of fatty acids were
more difficult to wash out and thus stayed mostly either in the black liquor or in the pulp
(Ekman & Holmbom, 2000).
The acid-soaked chips had more than double the content of acid 18:2 and more
acid 18:1(9) than the water-soaked chips, as can be seen in figure 4.14. The content of the
fatty acids in the acid-soaked chips should be in the same range as in the RefLCa sample.
However, higher contents of the fatty acids were found in the acid-soaked chips than in

Pinja Lillrank

Results and discussion

49

RefLCa. The difference was especially notable in the content of acid 18:2. The content of
the fatty acids in the water-soaked chips should be the same as in the RefNCa and the
RefHCa samples. In these cases as well, the contents were lower in the samples than in
the chips, but the difference was smaller than between the acid-soaked chips and RefLCa.
The content of acid 18:2 and acid 18:1(9) should be the same in the acid-soaked chips
plus the added sunflower oil and in SpiLCa. Accordingly, the content of the two fatty
acids should be the same in the water-soaked chips plus the added sunflower oil and in
SpiNCa and SpiHCa. In all cases more extractives were detected in the raw materials than
in the cooked samples, which suggests that some of the extractives were degraded or
modified during the cook.

Figure 4.15 shows the content of betulinol in the chips and in the birch bark that was
added to the spiked samples as well as the content of betulinol that was found in all the
samples. A very low content of betulinol was detected in the chips, the content being as
low as 0.02 mg/g for the acid-soaked chips and 0.01 mg/g for the water-soaked chips.
Therefore, it is strange that a notable content of betulinol was detected in the reference
samples. Maybe traces of bark somehow slipped into the cooks despite careful selection
of the chips. A higher content of betulinol was detected in the spiked samples than in the
added birch bark. These results indicate that something happened in the cooks that may
have made betulinol easier to extract, or that some other compounds were eluted at the
same time as betulinol. On the other hand, betulinol was so overloaded in the spiked
samples, as can be seen in figure 4.16, that the quantification with GC was difficult. This
was possibly the reason for the seemingly higher content of betulinol in the spiked
samples than in the birch bark.

5 Conclusions
In this chapter, the most important conclusions based on the results of the extractions and
analyses done in this work will be presented, especially regarding samples with high
contents of calcium. First, some conclusions regarding sample handling will be presented.
Regarding pulp sample handling it is important that pulp filter cakes are homogenized
before taking aliquots for extraction. Due to pressing, and thus the water movement
(downward and outward in the filter cake), extractives are most likely unevenly
distributed between the outer and inner parts of the pulp filter cake and between the top
and bottom parts of the pulp filter cake. The lack of homogenization of certain filter cakes
may have affected the results obtained for the mill pulp samples. For further information
on the problem, see chapter 4.1.1.
Of the solvents tested with ASE, acetone:water:acetic acid 95:4:1 was the easiest to use
and resulted in the highest content of detected extractives. When the pulp was pre-treated
by acidifying it to pH 1, and when phosphoric acid was used in the ASE solvent instead
of acetic acid, an accurate analysis of the extractives was impossible, because the extracts
formed a thick black precipitate when they were dried in the silylation stage, and this
precipitate could not be silylated and analysed properly with GC. Even after additional
liquid-liquid extraction of the ASE extract in these two cases, the identification of
components was difficult.
When the content of calcium was high, the washing efficiency decreased, and more
extractives were retained in the pulp than at lower calcium contents. With a high content
of calcium, the Kappa number (i.e., content of lignin) of the pulp was high, which also
suggests a less efficient washing. At a high calcium content, more extractives were also
found in the black liquor, and less extractives were found in the wash filtrate than at low
calcium contents.
There were some discrepancies between the contents of extractives detected in the raw
materials and in the cooked sample fractions, especially for the acid-soaked chips and the
corresponding samples with a low content of calcium. This, and the fact that more
extractives were detected in the acid-soaked chips than in the water-soaked chips,
warrants further investigation into the effect that acid-soaking has on birch chips. The
chips should also be analysed before soaking to assess if water-soaking could be
responsible for releasing and removing certain extractives. Variables in ASE, such as the

Pinja Lillrank

Conclusions

53

effect of cycle length and possibly the number of extraction cycles, could also be further
investigated. Regarding reflux, different refluxing times could be compared as well as
different solvents, e.g. acetone:water:acetic acid 95:4:1 that was used in ASE, versus
acetone:water 9:1. This solvent comparison could also be done for ASE, since acetonewater was not used as a solvent for ASE in this work.

5.1 Recommended analytical procedures for optimized extraction of
unbleached birch kraft pulp and wash filtrate at high calcium
levels
An analysis method should be as accurate as possible and in addition be as fast and easy
as possible in order to save time, resources and to minimize errors. These factors have
been taken into account when making the recommendations for the analytical methods.
5.1.1 Recommendations for pulps
For extraction of birch kraft pulp, ASE with the acetic acid solvent (acetone, water and
acetic acid in the ratio 95:4:1) and reflux with added phosphate were the most efficient of
the extraction methods used in this work. ASE is a faster extraction method than reflux,
and there are fewer instances where human error can skew the results. ASE is also more
automated than reflux, so if the equipment and expertise is available, ASE with the acetic
acid solvent is the recommended extraction method for unbleached birch kraft pulps. If,
however, ASE equipment or expertise is not available, reflux with added phosphate can
be used to yield similar contents of extractives. The extract should be silylated and
analysed with GC.
5.1.2 Recommendations for wash filtrates
When analysing wash filtrates, it is important to acidify the samples prior to extraction.
Acidification to pH 3.5 and acidification to pH 1 yielded similar results, which means that
pH 3.5 is sufficiently low for effective extraction of wash filtrates and is therefore the
recommended extraction method for unbleached birch kraft wash filtrates. After
acidification, the filtrates should be liquid-liquid extracted with MTBE and the extract
should be silylated and analysed with GC.

Extraktivämnen i oblekt kraftmassa och tvättfiltrat av björk: Fokus på utveckling
av analysmetoder
Träd består till största del av cellulosa, hemicellulosor och lignin. Utöver dessa
komponenter finns det i träd en grupp som kallas extraktivämnen. Extraktivämnena består
av tusentals småmolekylära organiska föreningar som har olika uppgifter. Till exempel
fungerar vissa ämnen som energireserv medan andra har i uppgift att försvara trädet mot
insekter och skadliga mikroorganismer. Mängden och typen av extraktivämnen varierar
mellan olika trädslag, och ibland även mellan träd inom samma släkte, beroende på var
de har vuxit och hur gammalt trädet är. I regel utgör extraktivämnena under 5 % av trädet.
Trots att extraktivämnena är en så liten del av träd, utgör de ändå ett problem vid massaoch papperstillverkning. Om extraktivämnena fälls ut på fibrerna och på det sättet hamnar
i produkten, försämras produktens kvalitet, till exempel kan papprets styrka bli sämre.
Med den stigande fokusen på miljövänlighet har processvattnets cirkulation stängts
alltmer, vilket betyder att extraktivämnen ackumuleras i processvattnet och orsakar
problem i högre grad än tidigare. Dessutom orsakar vissa oorganiska ämnen, speciellt
calcium, problem med extraktivämnen genom att göra dem svårare att tvätta bort. För att
kunna minska problemen som uppstår på grund av extraktivämnen bör det finnas pålitliga
och exakta metoder för att analysera extraktivämnen i industriella processer. För att
analys av extraktivämnena ska vara möjligt behöver de först extraheras, vilket således är
en del av analysen. Målet med detta arbete var att hitta den bästa analysmetoden för
extraktivämnen i oblekt kraftmassa och tvättfiltrat av björk.
Först analyserades massa- och tvättfiltrat från en massafabrik i Finland med flera olika
metoder. Av dessa valdes tre metoder för analys av massa, och tre metoder för analys av
tvättfiltrat ut för fortsatta tester. Dessa är de enda metoderna som kommer att behandlas i
denna sammanfattning.
Sex olika laboratoriekok gjordes specifikt för detta arbete. I tre av koken ändrades endast
kalciumhalten, så att ett kok hade mindre kalcium än vanligt, ett kok hade oförändrad
mängd kalcium och ett kok hade tillsatt kalcium. Den björkflis som användes för koket
med låg kalciumhalt tvättades med syra före koket för att minska kalciumhalten. Före de
två andra koken tvättades björkflisen med vatten. Tre ytterligare kok gjordes, där
kalciumhalten ändrades på samma sätt som tidigare, och dessutom tillsattes björkbark och

Pinja Lillrank

55

solrosolja för att öka mängden extraktivämnen i dessa prov. Genom tillsats av björkbark
ökades mängden betulinol och genom tillsats av solrosolja ökades mängden fettsyror.
Obehandlade massaprov extraherades med accelererad lösningsmedelsextraktion, ASE
(eng. accelerated solvent extraction), med ett lösningsmedel som bestod av aceton, vatten
och ättiksyra i proportionerna 95:4:1. Obehandlade massaprov extraherades också med
reflux med tillsatt fosfat och med ett lösningsmedel som bestod av aceton och vatten i
proportionerna 9:1. Massaproven förbehandlades också före extraktion genom att surgöra
dem till pH 1. Därefter extraherades de med ASE med ett lösningsmedel som bestod av
aceton och cyklohexan i proportionerna 9:1.
Tvättfiltraten surgjordes före extraktion, både till pH 3,5 och till pH 1. Efter surgörningen
extraherades proverna med vätske-vätske extraktion med lösningsmedlet MTBE (metyltert-butyleter). Tvättfiltraten analyserades också direkt, utan extraktion.
Analys av extrakten och tvättfiltratproven gjordes genom att silylera lösningarna och
använda GC (gaskromatografi) för att identifiera enskilda extraktivämnen och grupper av
extraktivämnen. Gravimetrisk bestämning av totala mängden fasta partiklar utfördes på
de flesta proverna.
Svartluten analyserades också för att få en helhetsbild av den totala mängden
extraktivämnen i varje laboratoriekok. Detta för att jämföra hur kalciumhalten i koken
påverkade extraktivämnena.
För att få en helhetsbild av den totala mängden extraktivämnen som borde hittas i varje
laboratoriekok analyserades även råvarornas extraktivämnen. Till råvarorna hör
solrosoljan och björkbarken som tillsattes till tre av laboratoriekoken, samt syratvättad
björkflis som användes i laboratoriekoken med mindre kalcium, och vattentvättad
björkflis som användes i resten av laboratoriekoken.
I björkbarken upptäcktes överlägset mest betulinol, vilket är i enlighet med teori.
Solrosoljans mest förekommande beståndsdel som analyserades var fettsyra 18:2. En
skillnad i de upptäckta extraktivämnena i den syratvättade och den vattentvättade
björkflisen var att den syratvättade björkflisen verkade innehålla mycket mer
fettsyra 18:2. Överlag extraherades det större mängder extraktivämnen från den
syratvättade björkflisen än från den vattentvättade björkflisen. Det är oklart varför de
olika björkflisen verkade ha olika mängd extraktivämnen. Möjligen kan den syratvättade
björkflisen hamnat ut för kontamination, eller så påverkade syran extraktionen så att

extraktivämnena lättare extraherades ur träcellerna. Alternativt tvättades en del av
extraktivämnena bort från björkflisen med vattnet men inte med syran.
Mängden extraktivämnen i massan, tvättfiltratet och svartluten ändrade inte märkbart
mellan koken med olika kalciumhalt för de kok dit ingen björkbark och solrosolja tillsatts.
I de kok där tillsatserna gjordes var skillnaden i andelen extraktivämnen mellan de olika
fraktionerna märkbar. I det kok där kalciumhalten var låg hittades mest extraktivämnen i
tvättfiltratet och minst extraktivämnen hittades i massan. I koket med normal kalciumhalt
var trenden likadan, men en större mängd extraktivämnen hittades i svartluten jämfört
med koket med låg kalciumhalt. I det kok som hade hög kalciumhalt hittades den högsta
mängden extraktivämnen i svartluten, och den minsta mängden i tvättfiltratet. I massan
hittades en större mängd extraktivämnen än i koken med mindre mängd kalcium. Dessa
resultat tyder på att det är svårare att tvätta bort extraktivämnena från massan då
kalciumhalten är hög, vilket är i enlighet med teori.
Då de olika extraktionsmetoderna för massaproverna jämförs är det tydligt att det
upptäcktes minst extraktivämnen med metoden där massan förbehandlades genom att
surgöra den till pH 1 och sedan extraherades med ASE med lösningsmedlet innehållande
cyklohexan. Detta tyder på att denna metod inte är en effektiv extraktionsmetod. Både
ASE med lösningsmedlet innehållande ättiksyra, och reflux med tillsatt fosfat verkade
vara ungefär lika effektiva extraktionsmetoder.
Av analysmetoderna som användes för tvättfiltraten upptäcktes den största mängden
extraktivämnen med den direkta analyseringen av tvättfiltratet för de kok dit ingen
björkbark och solrosolja tillsatts. I övrigt upptäcktes väldigt lika mängd extraktivämnen
med alla tre metoder i varje kok. Dock var det svårare att identifiera extraktivämnena då
analysen gjordes direkt på tvättfiltratet utan att extrahera det först.
På basen av dessa resultat rekommenderas extraktion med ASE med aceton-vattenättiksyralösningen som metod att användas för extraktion av massa. Detta för att den är
en snabbare och mer pålitlig metod än reflux, vilken med fördel kan användas ifall det
inte finns tillgång till ASE. Fastän det upptäcktes mest extraktivämnen i tvättfiltraten efter
den direkta analysen av tvättfiltrat rekommenderas inte denna metod eftersom
kromatogrammen var mer svårtolkade än för de två andra metoderna, vilket kan medföra
problem i korrekt identifiering av extraktivämnen. För tvättfiltrat rekommenderas istället
en surgörning av tvättfiltratet till pH 3,5, eftersom den metoden extrahera lika mycket

som surgörningen till pH 1, och det är onödigt att surgöra provet mer än nödvändigt.
Extrakten bör silyleras och analyseras med GC.
