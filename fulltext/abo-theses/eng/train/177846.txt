ABSTRAKT
Gällande dagens energifrågor eftersträvar man att förbättra redan existerande teknologier samt
att producera nya, grönare teknologier för att skapa en miljövänlig och hållbar framtid. Som
ett resultat av restriktioner på växthusgasutsläpp för att motverka global uppvärmning, globala
och lokala mål för kolneutrala samhällen samt ökande krav på energieffektivitet bör företag
nu se över deras energianvändning och hur de ska uppfylla dessa mål.
Denna avhandling och det underliggande arbetet fokuserar på det aktuella företagets
energianvändning gällande elektricitet och fjärrvärme. Målsättningen med detta arbete var att
få en helhetsbild över användningen av elektricitet och fjärrvärme samt att få en bättre
förståelse av de faktorer som påverkar energianvändningen och dess kostnader. Utgående från
denna

helhetsbild

kunde

man

sedan

kartlägga

problematiska

områden

eller

användningssituationer inom företagets verksamhet som är i behov av förbättringar eller
ytterligare analyser.
Denna helhetsbild skapades genom att samla data gällande energianvändningen från interna
och externa källor. Helhetsbilden över den årliga användningen användes som grund vid
vidare analyser och beräkningar. Dessa beräkningar har bestått av exempel på potentiella
förbättringar och användningssituationer, där resultatet som erhölls indikerar hur dessa
förändringar skulle påverka de årliga energikostnaderna, den årliga energiåtgången och
potentiella minskningar i utsläpp av växthusgaser.
Utgående från de beräkningar och analyser som gjordes för detta arbete konstaterades att
energisystemens uppbyggnad och användningssätt var aningen föråldrade och att det fanns ett
verkligt behov av förbättring och förnyelse. De föreslagna förbättringarna bestod av att
effektivera hanteringen av överloppsvärme och återcirkulering i värmesystemen samt att
förbättra fördelningen av internt producerad elektricitet. Beräkningarna visar att företaget
genom de föreslagna förbättringarna beräkningarna har stor potential till att markant minska
energiåtgången får externa leverantörer, samt att minska såväl energikostnaderna som onödiga
utsläpp som uppstod från ett ineffektivt användningssätt av energin.

ABSTRACT
In terms of energy in the current society, efforts are made to improve existing technologies
and to produce new greener technologies for a climate-friendly and sustainable future. With
emission restrictions to counteract global warming, global and local goals towards a carbon
neutral society, and increasing demands on energy efficiency to prevent energy losses and
reducing emissions, companies have to analyze their energy usage and investigate what
changes are needed to meet these demands.
This thesis and the underlying project focuses on the case study company’s electricity and
district heating energy usage. The aim of the study was to establish a general picture of the
current energy usage for the company and to get a better picture of what factors have an impact
on the energy usage and the corresponding energy costs. From this general picture it was
possible to locate key factors and problem areas within the company’s operation which are in
need of improvement or further analysis.
This general picture was established by collecting data regarding the energy usage from
internal and external sources. The general picture of the yearly energy usage served as a ground
for further analyses and calculations. These calculations have consisted of examples of
potential improvements and usage scenarios, where the results obtained indicates how the
changes would affect the yearly energy costs, the yearly energy consumption and potential
emission reductions.
From the calculations and analyses in this study, it was concluded that the existing energy
system setup was slightly outdated and there existed an need for improvement and renewal.
The suggested improvements consisted of make the handling of excess heat more efficient and
utilizing recirculation in the heat systems as well as improving the distribution of own
internally produced electricity. The calculations shows that the suggested improvements offers
great potential for the company to significantly reduce the energy consumption from external
suppliers, the yearly energy costs and reduce unnecessary emissions which arose from an
inefficient way of handling the energy.

Key words: energy usage, electricity, district heating, emissions

INTRODUCTION

In terms of energy in the current society, efforts are made to improve existing
technologies and to produce new greener technologies for a climate-friendly and
sustainable future. With emission restrictions to counteract global warming, global and
local goals towards a carbon neutral society, and increasing demands on energy
efficiency to prevent energy losses and reducing emissions, companies have to analyze
their energy usage and investigate what changes are needed to meet these demands
(Huttunen, 2017). A transition from fossil fuels into greener technologies and
renewable energy sources creates further requirements on energy systems. With these
requirements energy systems need to be more flexible to be able to provide a
sustainable production. Especially energy-intensive industries, such as forest and
metal, have a need to look over their energy usage to be able to improve their processes
to meet these demands (Paiho, et al., 2018).
This also the case for Wärtsilä, for whom this project has been conducted. With the
plans of relocating the business sectors in Vaasa such as engine production and engine
testing to new facilities the question of energy usage surfaced. The aim of the study is
to establish the current energy usage at the existing facilities as well as the energy used
on a yearly basis and, thereby, the yearly costs. Further, the study will discuss how the
energy usage can be improved in the new facilities to enhance the energy utilization,
reduce emissions and be more economically beneficial. The thesis focuses mainly on
the costs and emissions that can be reduced from external suppliers.
This thesis focuses on electricity and district heating usage. Although engine
production, engine testing and surrounding equipment for power plants and marine
vessels are the main products for the company, electricity and district heating play a
key role in the engine testing and production processes. This is because of the fact that
vast amounts of electricity are both consumed and produced during these processes
and similar is the case for district heating and excess heat. The scope of the thesis was
divided into three parts. The first one was to investigate how the current energy
landscape in Finland, which would serve as background theory and as a baseline for
part two. Part two consisted of gathering data on electricity and district heating usage
at the existing facilities and analyze the data. Part three was, from the results obtained

2
from the analyses, to locate key factors in need for improvement in the new facilities
to create a more efficient and economically beneficial energy system setup.
In terms of efficiency, the calculations conducted as a part of the thesis does not
include the efficiency coefficient of the facilities or the possible changes in the
coefficient. Instead efficiency is employed as a term of utilizing the energy in more
useful ways and not as a numerical value. The efficiency utilization comes from
reducing losses by harnessing excess heat, distributing produced electricity in a
smarter way etc.
For the thesis and the underlying project there have been some delimitations in the
scope the thesis. The thesis focuses only on the Järvikatu facilities and the Vaskiluoto
Engine Laboratory. The Runsor facilities and smaller independent offices have
purposely been left out, since they are not affected by the relocation or their energy
usage are not so vast that they have a great impact on the overall results. Production
costs such as fuel and engine testing emissions have not been included in this thesis
and the underlying project, since these will still be present in the future facilities as
well.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In today’s world, reliable and affordable energy is a necessity in the everyday life.
Finland has succeeded in building an energy system which is diverse and efficient.
Because of the systems’ diversity, Finland is not dependent on one individual energy
source (Finnish Energy, 2020). A balanced production mix has guaranteed that the
price of electricity and district heat in Finland is among the lowest in Europe. With
constant renewal and maintenance of the Finnish district heating and electricity
network as well as the power plants, a reliable energy flow has been established where
outages and disruptions are rare.
Compared to the rest of the countries in Europe, Finland is one of the top countries in
terms of electricity consumption per capita. According to Kauniskangas (2013), this is
due to the structure of the country’s industry and its northern location. In Finland, the
industry accounts for about half of the total electricity consumption. This is due to the
vast majority of energy-intensive industries, such as forest and metal, whose
production processes consume copious amounts of electricity. However, the industries
also own a majority of the country’s electricity production.
As a part of the thesis was to investigate how the energy landscape in Finland looks
today as a basis for further investigation into the company’s own energy usage, a part
of the work conducted for the thesis is presented as background theory in this chapter
and the following subchapters. The following chapters and subchapters will cover the
electricity and district heating usage in Finland today and what the trend has looked
like for the last decade. Also factors which affect the energy prices in Finland and
therein the electricity market will be presented and explained as they are a part of the
investigation into the costs and profits of the company’s energy usage.

2.1

Electricity market

Finland was one of the first countries, in addition to Great Britain, Sweden and
Norway, to open its electricity market for competition (Kauniskangas, 2013). The
market began to open up in stages in 1995. Since 1998, also households can request
for tenders from different electricity suppliers. But tenders cannot be requested for the
electricity transmission and distribution, because it would not be beneficial for
consumer with several parallel electricity networks. Opening of the electricity market
for competition has been facilitated by the fact that traditionally there have been a lot
of different electricity producers and suppliers in the Nordic countries.
To establish an efficient functioning of the electricity market, it requires openness and
free competition. Because of the free competition in market, the produced electricity
is selected on basis of supply and demand. Electricity generation methods with low
variable costs are utilized first, and power plants vary from one another in great extent
in terms of their cost structure and regulating properties (Kauniskangas, 2013). For
example, nuclear power plants and hydro power, have low operating cost but are
expensive to construct. However, with their low running and operating costs, they are
worth running for as many hours a year as possible. These kind of power plants are
called base load power plants. Sometimes the demand for electricity grows so high
that it pays and is necessary to start up power plants with higher operating costs and
fuel costs. These kind of power plants are called peak load power plants and often
powered by gas or coal.
Peak load power plants come in to use when the demand is very high, e.g. on very cold
days in the winter. However, Kauniskangas (2013) noted that the electricity production
is also affected by the weather in additional ways. Hydro power is the most utilized
energy source in the Nordics and stands for a about half of the electricity needs. During
a very dry year with low rainfall, the hydro power production diminishes especially in
Finland since most of the hydro power plants are run-of river plants. That means that
they need a constant river flow to produce electricity, and with low rainfall the amount
of water that flows in the river decreases. Further, with warmer winters with low
snowfall, the amount of water in reservoirs in storage power plant decreases and can’t

5
produce as much electricity during the year.
2.1.1 Fingrid Oyj
Fingrid Oyj is a Finnish public limited liability company which is responsible for the
electricity transmission in the high-voltage transmission system in Finland (Fingrid
Oyj, 2020). The nationwide grid that Fingrid operates is an essential part of the
electrical power system in Finland and the transmission grid is a high-voltage trunk
network which entirely covers Finland. Connected to this nationwide grid are major
power plants, industrial plants and regional distribution networks. The transmission
system in Finland consists of over 14,000 kilometres of 400, 220 and 110 kilovolt
transmission lines plus more than 100 substations. In addition, the Finnish power
system is part of the inter-Nordic power system. The inter-Nordic system is connected
to the system in Continental Europe by means of high-voltage direct current
transmission links. Moreover, there are high-voltage direct current links from Finland
to Russia and Estonia. Fingrid provides its contractual customers, in other words
electricity producers, network companies and industrial enterprises, with system,
cross-border transmission and balance services. Fingrid serves the electricity market
by attending to adequate electricity transmission capacity, by removing transmission
restrictions between countries, and by proving information on the electricity market.
The high-voltage trunk network, or the nation-wide main transmission grid, in Finland
is used in long-distance transmission connections and high transmission voltages. The
power lines of the main grid are mainly built as overhead lines, as it much more
expensive to use underground cables in long transmission distances (Finnish Energy,
2020). In order to minimise transmission losses in the main grid, the voltage is high
and operating between 110 and 400 kilovolts. The second level in the Finnish
electricity network are the high-voltage distribution networks, which continues the
main grid. The high-voltage distribution networks distribute electricity at the regional
level, for example, in different provinces. Regional networks are connected to the main
grid and distribute electricity regionally usually on one or more 110 kV lines.
Distribution networks are either connected directly to the main grid or use the grid
services via a local network. The distribution networks operate at a voltage level of 0.4
to 110 kV. Households are linked to distribution networks. Industries, trade, services

6
and other consumption (e.g. agriculture) are connected to a distribution or regional
network or to the main transmission grid, depending on each individual case. Power
plants are connected to a distribution or regional network or to the main grid as
appropriate in each case. The layout of Finnish power transmission network is show
in the following Figure. 1 (Fingrid Oyj, 2020).

2.1.2 Nord Pool market
In the Nordic countries approximately 80 percent of the consumed electricity is traded
on the Nordic power exchange, Nord Pool. The power exchange was first established
in 1993 in Norway and then the exchange started to expand by degrees (Kauniskangas,
2013). Nord Pool is owned by the different Nordic transmission system operators,
which in Finland is Fingrid Oyj.
The power exchange functions as a marketplace in the electricity market in the same
way as the stock exchange functions in the stock market. Produced electricity is bought
by industrial retailers and enterprises. At the exchange the wholesale market price is
determined on a basis of supply and demand. According to Kauniskangas (2013), this
means in practice that the electricity buyers tell the exchange how much electricity
they want to buy and at what, and the sellers correspondingly make their own bids at
which price they want to sell at. Then the wholesale price is determined in the
intersection of the supply and demand, all sales and purchase bids. The Nord Pool
market consists of two different markets, the Nord Pool Spot and Elbas. The Spot
market of the power exchange, the wholesale electricity price is formed separately for
each hour of the following 24-hour period. However, the need electricity demand may
fluctuate, for example, when sudden unexpected changes occur in the weather forecast
or the consumption expectations. A power plant may develop a fault and the producer
must acquire more electricity to sell. In these kinds of cases, electricity buyers can
acquire their electricity from the Elbas intra-day market, where the electricity price
often deviates from the Spot market price.
For the electricity the producers, the price level of the offered electricity is affected by
the means the electricity is produced, i.e. the variable costs of the power plants they
are using. If the demand of electricity peaks momentarily, peak load power plants
might be needed to accommodate for the increase in electricity demand. When these
situations occur, the electricity price rises and correspondingly when the demand is
low and only base load plants are running the prices will fall (Kauniskangas, 2013). In
the Nordic market, the electricity only has the same wholesale price throughout and
area for a couple of hours of the year. Price differences occurs in so-called bottleneck

8
situations and to provide for these the Nordic market has been divided into different
price areas. These are situations when congestions in the transmission network occurs.
Congestions in the transmission networks may arise when more electricity should be
transmitted to for example Finland than the transmission line between Finland and
Sweden can deliver. That is when the price of electricity is cheaper in Sweden than in
Finland, and thus is more expensive to produce electricity in Finland than it is to import
from Sweden. Efforts are constantly made to prevent bottleneck situations and
congestions in the transmission networks, efforts such as increasing the transmission
capacities. If a congestion situation arises inside the different price areas, the
transmission system operators will reduce the transmission need by increasing
production in areas with underproduction and decreasing in areas with overproduction.
2.1.3 Emissions trading
Another factor that affects the price of electricity, especially on power plants using
combustion technologies, are the EU emissions trading. The European Union has
selected emissions trading as a method of reducing emissions to the required by
international agreements (Kauniskangas, 2013). It is based on international climate
negotiations and the Kyoto protocol, the signatory countries of which are committed
to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The target with this method is to reduce
the emissions of greenhouse gases from energy production and industry, and to
increase the use of renewable and other emission-free energy sources. The emissions
emitted from energy production and industry can also be reduced by increasing the
efficiency of the production processes (MEE, 2014).
The Kyoto Protocol is a specification for the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 (MOE, 2020). It is the first
legally binding agreement on the reduction of emissions on an international scale. The
Kyoto Protocol commits the signatory industrial countries to the mitigation of climate
change and agreed to cut their country’s emissions five percent below the 1990 level
between 2008-2012. A second commitment period was agreed upon in 2012, which
added new emission reduction targets for participating countries for the time period
2012-2020. However, the 2012 agreement was short lived. Because in 2015 at the
sustainable development summit held in Paris, all United Nations Framework

9
Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, participants signed yet another pact to
combat climate change. This Paris Climate Agreement did in fact replace the Kyoto
Protocol (Huttunen, 2017). The Paris agreement entered into force in 2016 and the
goal of the agreement is to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Another purpose of the
agreement is to strengthen the participant states ability to adapt to climate change and
to steer financial flows towards new low-carbon technologies and progress which is
sustainable from a climate point of view.
Huttunen (2017) notes that Finland’s long term goal is to have a carbon neutral society.
In 2017 the Finnish government presented a new National Energy and Climate
strategy, which outlines the actions needed for Finland to reach the targets specified in
the Government Programme and targets agreed upon European Union for 2030. The
aim is to systematically set the course to achieve an 80-95 percent reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To achieve this there is plan to reduce the domestic
use of imported oil, increase the share of transport biofuels and to increase the share
of renewable energy. Also there is an aim to increase the amount of electric and gas
powered cars in the Finnish car park, to reduce emissions.
The EU has defined how much carbon dioxide its industry and energy production can
produce. This means that companies must verify their own emissions each year. They
can buy or sell emission allowances according to their need on the international
exchange. The price of these emission allowances is affected by the expense of
emission reduction and the number of emission allowances on offer (Kauniskangas,
2013).
Because of this trading system of emissions, electricity generation with fossil fuels is
becoming more expensive. Kauniskangas (2013) claims that emissions trading has had
a great impact on the mutual competitiveness of different production methods. For
example, the profitability of using hydro or nuclear power plants has grown compered
to power plants using fossil fuels as production method. The emission trading increases
the production costs of electricity produced from fossil fuels, which in turn raises the

10
price of electricity in the wholesale market.
2.2

Energy taxes

In Finland taxes are an added cost to the electricity or the district heating prices, both
for consumption and production (Skatteförvaltningen, 2020). Apart from the standard
Value Added Tax, VAT, there are other excise taxes and fees. Excise taxes are indirect
taxes on the consumption or sales of specific products. Excise taxes are collected for
fiscal reasons, but they are also intended to promote social and health policy objectives
as well as environmental and energy policy goals. In addition, excise taxes are imposed
on products manufactured in Finland and products imported into Finland. Further,
excise taxes are product-specific, which means that the amount of taxes paid is based
on the number of products consumed in taxable use or products supplied for taxable
use. In the EU, there are two types of excise taxes: excise taxes that have been
harmonized by directives and excised taxes that are set by individual Member States.
Harmonization means that the products are subject to excise taxes in all EU Member
States and that minimum tax rates have been set for these products. There are also
product groups, which the excise taxes have been set at national level.
According to Skatteförvaltningen (2020), there is an excise tax on electricity in
Finland, and the most central operators which are liable for excise tax on electricity
are electricity producers and network operators who needs to register with Finnish tax
administration. Buyers and sellers of electricity and electricity importers as of rule is
not liable for excise tax on electricity, unless they are also electricity producers or
network operators. There are two different tax categories for the electricity excise tax,
one lower and one higher level. The lower level, category II, is levied on electricity
that is consumed and separately metered in the industrial manufacturing, data centers
and server rooms and professional greenhouse cultivation. Lower category taxes are a
state aid, which means the benefactor must register with the beneficiary registry. The
higher level, category I, is levied on all other electricity consumption such as
commercial buildings and offices. Certain types of electricity consumption and
transmission are however tax-free. These are electricity transmitted between grids,
electricity transferred to the grid from a producer or an importer, transmitted for

11
consumption in another area than Finland, transferred to an electrical producer and
electricity which is consumed in production of electricity or in combined heat and
power production in the power plants electrical equipment for own consumption.
All taxable electricity is also liable for a security stockpile fee (NESA, 2020). The
reason for the security stockpile fee is, as the name says, security of supplies in
Finland. The general objective is to safeguard the supplies of societal basic needs,
which in emergency situations are vital for the populations life condition, the society’s
functionality and security as well as the material prerequisite for the country’s
defences. These supplies include provisions, energy, transports, warehousing and
distribution systems, technical systems, health services, and manufacturing and repairs
for the military defence.
District heat per se as a product is not liable for excise taxes in Finland. But the fuels
and methods used in the production are. Different fuels have different excise taxes if
they are used for heating and combustion purposes, but aren’t liable if used for
electricity production. However, then the electricity itself might be depending on the
categories mentioned earlier. For example in the case of combined heat and electricity
production, excise taxes are paid on the fuel and excise taxes are paid on the produced
electricity. But the fuel used in the production is divided separately in heat production
and electricity production, and only taxes are paid on the part of the fuel which has
been categorized as a part of heat production (Skatteförvaltningen, 2020).
2.3

Electricity in Finland

Finland is one of the top countries in regard of electricity consumption per capita. The
following claims are based on information provided by Statistics Finland (2020), see
Table. 1. For the last decade the total electricity consumption has been about 84 TWh
per year with an interval of 6 TWh. The electricity production has been about 70 TWh
per year with an interval of 10 TWh. In regards of electricity production, Finland has
its production distributed among several different energy sources and production
types. The distribution of energy sources in electricity production have been fairly
constant over the last decade. The biggest energy sources are nuclear power, combined

12
heat and power, CHP, and imported energy, which each has contributed with around
25 percent of the total production. Nuclear power is the largest individual energy
source since CHP uses different types of fuel and the imported energy comes from
different kind of energy sources.

With greater emission regulations and a goal to decarbonize Finland, a third nuclear
reactor, Olkiluoto 3, is being built on the Olkiluoto Island next to the two existing
reactors Olkiluoto 1 and 2. According to latest schedule the plan is to start up regular
production at the plant in March 2021 with an electrical output of 1600 MW. This
would correspond to an energy output for a year of roughly 13 TWh. That amount
could replace about half the electrical energy consumption from CHP production,
which will have a significant impact emissions. However, there is a problem with
replacing that much of the CHP production with nuclear power and that is that the
majority of Finnish district heat is produced in CHP plants (TVO, 2009). District
heating production as a part of nuclear power is a concept that has become a hot topic
for public discussion. Leppänen (2019) claims that the main challenge with using
district heating reactor technologies or co-generation with power reactors are problems
related to urban siting. Existing regulatory guidelines in Finland are historically based
on the idea that nuclear power plants should be constructed far from densely populated
areas, and to reduce the consequences of severe accidents by limiting public exposure.
In practice this is done by defining large emergency planning zones (EPZ) around the
site. And since it is not cost-effective to transfer heat over large distances, due to losses,

reactors designed for district heating have to be constructed closer to consumption
points which is not really applicable for power reactors.
2.3.1 Imported electricity
The following claims are based on information provided by Statistics Finland (2020),
see Table. 2. The imported electricity to Finland has changed quite a bit over the last
decade. The total amount of imported energy has increased with about 7 TWh, from
15.46 TWh in 2009 to 22.55 TWh in 2018. However, based on Brink (2017), the
biggest change in the electricity import is the change in which country whom Finland
imports its electricity from. In the beginning of the decade Russia was Finland main
exporter of electricity, but from 2012 and onwards Sweden was the main exporter of
electricity to Finland. This can be seen in Table. 2 below. One of the main reasons that
this change in importer happened is because of in late 2011 the new High Voltage
Direct Current, HVDC, connection between Sweden and Finland named Fenno-Skan
2 was taken into use. This new cable has a capacity of 800 MW, adding to the existing
400 MW capacity of the existing Fenno-Skan 1 connection. Another factor that
changed the import was that in 2011, Russia raised its export taxes significantly, which
lead to that the import to Finland had to be substituted by another country.

2.3.2 Electricity exports
There have been large variations in the electricity export from Finland during the last
decade. Export is conducted to Sweden, Norway, Estonia and Russia, but the amount
of electricity varies. In the beginning Sweden was the country which most electricity
was exported to, but from 2012 and forward, Estonia is where the majority of
electricity is exported to. This can be seen in Table. 3 below, based on information
provided by Statistics Finland (2020). Exporting electricity to Russia only became
available during 2014, when an up 350 MW connection was established. Before that
only importing from Russia was possible. However, the export to Russia is very small,
resulting in just a couple of GWh per year (European Union, 2014).

2.3.3 Consumption by sector
The electricity consumption in Finland has been quite consistent at about 84 TWh per
year the last ten years. Industry has been and is still the largest consumer sector. Next
comes the household and agriculture sector with the services and public sector tightly
following, which can be seen in Figure. 2 below with shows consumption data from
2018. The Finnish electrical network is not an ideal entity and there are some losses in
the network. But the transmission and distribution losses only stands for a couple of
percent of the total electricity consumption, which in 2018 was 3 percent according to
Statistics Finland (2020). Compered to Sweden, Finland has less transmission and
distribution losses. Sweden had about 7 percent in losses of their total consumption in

15
2018. One of the reason why Finland have less transmission losses is because of the
Finnish electrical network is slightly different built than Sweden’s, with shorter
distances between transformers and switching substations (Svenska Kraftnät, 2020).

Figure 2. Finnish electricity consumption in 2018

2.3.4 Electricity consumption in Vaasa
Vaasa as a municipality has a fairly low electricity consumption when considering the
population as well as the amounts of people that work in the municipality but lives in
surrounding regions. In 2018 Vaasa was ranked 14th in population in the country but
only 35th in electricity consumption, which can be seen in Table. 4, provided by
Statistics Finland (2020). Overall the electricity consumption in Vaasa has been fairly
constant over the last ten years for all sectors. Housing and agriculture sector consumes
approximately the same amount as the service and building sector, while the industry
sector consumes roughly half of what the other two sectors do (Finnish Energy, 2020).

The industry electricity consumption has started to slowly decrease during the last
years and the reason behind this is most probably also the reason why Vaasa is so lowranked in electricity consumption compared to population. The largest energy

16
technology concentration of the Nordic countries, called EnergyVaasa, is located in
the Vaasa region (Haveri, 2018). The cluster has become internationally significant
especially in the fields of smart electrical solutions, sustainable energy, flexible power
generation and digitalisation. Due to the fact that Vaasa has a vast amount of
companies that develops products in these areas, it stands to reason that the
municipality itself would also benefit from these companies in terms of electricity
consumption.
2.4

District heating in Finland

In district heating networks, thermal energy is produced in production plants which
then transmits the energy to customers as hot water in a closed district heating network
consisting of two pipes (supply and return pipes). According to Finnish Energy (2020),
the majority of district heating water is produced in CHP plants and the rest is produced
in heating plants, heat pumps and excess heat from industries. District heating water
does not circulate in the heating networks of buildings, as the district heating water
releases its heat to the building network via a heat exchanger. Meaning the district
heating supply pipe enters the heat exchanger, the heat is released to the buildings
heating network and the district heating water is conveyed back to the production plant
for re-heating through the return pipe. The temperature of district heating water in the
supply pipe varies according to the weather between 65 and 115 ºC and in the return
pipe usually between 40 and 60 °C. To prevent corrosion inside the district heating
pipes, the water is treated to remove mechanical impurities and oxygen. It is often also
coloured to localise any leaks. The colourant that turns the water slightly green is not
hazardous to health or the environment.
During the last decade, the consumption of district heating have been fairly constant
at around 34 TWh with a difference of about plus minus 3 TWh (Finnish Energy,
2018). Finland has a quite well built up district heating network with distributed district
heat in 168 towns around Finland in 2017. The length of the district heating network
at the end of 2017 was 14 920 km and the length of the network increases by 250–500
km each year, mainly as extensions to the existing network and as branch lines to
connect new buildings to the system. There were 108 power plants with a district

17
heating capacity of 8 300 MW. Power output of these CHP plants was 5 500 MW.
Also, there were 773 stationary heating plants as well as 14 separate heat recovery or
heat pump units. The heat capacity of the stationary heating plants and heat pumps was
14 000 MW. The district heating pipes have an effective thermal insulation, but there
are still heat losses in the network. Especially in rural areas with longer pipelines. Of
the energy produced in production plants and then transmitted by the pipes in Finland,
heat losses in the distribution network account for 8–9 percent, 5–8 percent in the
networks of the largest towns and 10–15 percent in the networks of small population
centres in rural areas. The total supply of the district heat that was produced in 2017
was 36 600 GWh, where 33 300 GWh of that was produced with fuels, mostly in
boilers (Statistics Finland, 2020). The remaining 3 300 GWh was produced with heat
recovery and heat pumps. As mentioned earlier the majority of district heating water
is produced in CHP plants, but production from heat pumps and heat recovery has
started to increase during the last decade. In 2017 68.0 % of the total supply was
produced in CHP plants or comparable cogeneration heat from gas turbines, gas
engines or Diesel engines. The electricity produced in the CHP plants was 10 900
GWh. In Table. 5 below show the allocation of fuels used in the last decade in district
heat production.
Table 5. Fuels used in Finnish district heating production

As can be seen in Table. 5, according to the Finnish goals of reducing emissions and
usage of fossil fuels, the usage of fossil fuels have decreased during the last decade
and renewables have increased. However, in line with Finnish Energy (2018) the
amount of fossil fuels used is still in majority which need to be reduced further to
accomplish the goal of a carbon neutral country. And even if wood-based are cleaner
than coal or oil, they still produce a lot of emission and slag products, which means

18
that they are just a temporary solution in replacing coal and oil.
2.5

Carbon dioxide emissions in Finland

Finland has a long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and eventually
achieving a carbon neutral society. With these goals the emissions such as carbon
dioxide has reduced during the last decade. The reduction has not been steadily each
year, as some years have resulted in a slight increase from the previous year. But the
overall trend for the last decade is that the carbon dioxide emissions and emissions
overall are reducing in correlation with the climate agreements and strategies. The
majority of the emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, with remaining gases
consists of methane, nitrous oxide etc. All this can be seen in Table. 6 below, based on
information provided by Statistics Finland (2020).

As can be seen in Table. 6, the emissions from industrial processes and agriculture has
been fairly constant. The largest reductions on emissions, but also fluctuations such as
slight increases, has been in the energy sector. This is expected due to several reasons.
One of the reasons is that energy sector includes the transport sector, where
improvements on engine efficiency have decreased fuel consumption and engine
emissions as well as transition towards cleaner fuels. Another factor is that for energy
production, the transition towards cleaner technologies, renewable resources and
increasing energy efficiencies have resulted in emission reductions. But the energy
production is also the reason for the fluctuations in yearly emissions, mostly due to
changes in supply and demand affected by seasonal and weather changes. Higher
energy demand results in higher emissions, especially since many peak-load power
plants uses fossil fuels. Therefore, the emission might increase one year even if the

19
overall trend is that emissions are reducing.
The city of Vaasa also follows the national trend of emission reductions. As for the
rest of the country the largest reductions in emission has happened in the energy and
transport sector. For the rest of sectors such as agriculture, the emissions are reducing
even if the amounts are not so large. This is shown in Table. 7 below, based on
information provided by Statistics Finland (2020).

Flexibility and optimisation of energy systems

With Finland’s goals of a wider adoption of a variable renewable production, a general
transition towards decarbonization, and reducing emissions, it is apparent that future
energy systems need increased flexibility. According to Paiho et al. (2018), one
challenge with an energy production based on renewable energy resources is that it
often fluctuates due to seasonal or other weather conditions, e.g. solar and wind power.
However, this supports the decentralization of the energy systems, and it also increases
flexibility requirements for the entire energy system. The long-term target of an energy
transition towards decarbonization of energy production has similar effects on energy
systems.

20
2.6.1 Flexibility
There is a current societal discussion on the need for flexibility in future energy
systems, but there is not a clear uniform definition of what flexibility means or what it
is. However, it is agreed upon that energy systems need flexibility to match with the
energy demand which varies over time (Paiho, et al., 2018). In terms of electricity and
the grid’s capability to be able to operate properly, the power system needs to be in
balance, which means that power supply and demand in the electric grid have to match
each other at each point of time. The electric system is built in such a way that it, up
to a certain point, has a capability to cope with uncertainty and variability in both the
demand and the supply of power. For example on the supply side, this kind of
flexibility is accomplished through power plants with different response time, which
are then the base-load, intermediate and peak-load power plants. From the electricity
system point of view, flexibility is closely related to the grid frequency and voltage
control, the delivery uncertainty and variability, and the power ramping rates (Lund,
Lindgren, Mikkola, & Salpakari, 2015).
In a future scenario where 100 percent of the energy is produced by renewable energy
sources, it is important that additional flexibility is created by connecting electricity,
heating, cooling and transport sectors together. One core idea is to consider flexibility
as a whole energy system concept, instead of only focusing on the flexibility of
individual branches. This highlights the fact that different energy sectors and branches
should provide flexibility services to other systems, even if the infrastructures are
separately owned and operated (Paiho, et al., 2018).

21
2.6.2 Optimisation and increasing flexibility
To achieve flexibility in energy systems and to optimise energy usage, energy storage
is a valid solution because they increase the flexibility to utilize sources of energy that
are not available at the same time as the demand (Paiho, et al., 2018). The different
storage technologies are often categorized in five different categories, which are
chemical, electrical, electrochemical, mechanical and thermal. However, how far the
advances in technologies for these categories has gone varies as many thermal storage
technologies are already in commercialization phase while many electric storage
technologies still remain in research and development or demonstration and
deployment phases.
Electrical energy storage is still an expensive technology (Xia, et al., 2018). With the
premise of instantaneously balancing power generation and consumptions, electrical
energy storage systems are often operated to store surplus energy in off-peak hours
and release it during energy-deficiency hours such that temporal arbitrages can be
obtained via economical scheduling of the stored energy. This leads to a solution which
is flexible and could be economically beneficial. However, with concerns on that
energy storage systems high capital costs outweighing its profits, the determination of
the optimal size for storage systems has become an important issue for its practical
utilization. There are no clear-cut guidelines on the most profitable solution, but are
instead very case dependent. Energy storage sizing and profits are vastly dependent on
the type of energy source, energy output amount and the energy system solution. Based
on Paiho et al. (2018), with their high capital cost, battery storage have not widely
implemented in the Finnish energy systems. But two large-scale commercial
implementations of lithium-ion batteries were taken place in Southern Finland in
2016–2017. These electricity storages are the largest in the Nordic countries. They are
both first used for experimental purposes and later on as parts of the distributed energy
systems.
In district heating and cooling systems, energy storage in form of thermal storage has
been used since the early heating and cooling generations. Utilizing thermal storage
for storing heat in hot water tanks or water reservoirs can increase energy flexibility

22
and potential of heat generation by shaving the peak load demand and balancing the
variation between supply and demand on both short-term and long-term basis (Ma,
Knotzer, Billanes, & Nørregaard Jørgensen, 2020). Studies in the field have
demonstrated the energy flexibility potentials of combining CHP and heat pumps in
district heating systems using thermal storage. The same results have been concluded
for the industries heating and cooling systems or HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning) systems in buildings, this by easier regulation of heating or cooling
demand and efficiency will increase with feedback loops for excess heat from system
processes. Thermal energy storage (TES) systems can store heat or cold which can be
used later when the demand is higher, under different conditions such as temperature
variations e.g. winter and summer, place or power. Implementing storage in an energy
system provides many benefits for the system, like better economics, reduction of
pollution and CO2 emissions, better performance and efficiency of the system and
better reliability in load changes. The CO2 emissions reduction is achieved as a result
of reusing stored energy and therefore not consuming fossil fuels or other greenhouse
gas emitting energy sources during energy generation and thus preventing emissions
from being emitted (Cabeza, Martorell, Miró, Fernández, & Barreneche, 2015).
Moreover, thermal energy storage enables the optimal control strategies by scheduling
energy generation better according to supply and demand, and therefore reducing fuel
costs and consumption, increasing the efficiency and as said earlier also reducing the
greenhouse gas emissions (Ma, Knotzer, Billanes, & Nørregaard Jørgensen, 2020).
2.7

Energy and climate program in Vaasa

The city of Vaasa has set up their own energy and climate program (City of Vaasa,
2015). The program is a compilation of goals and actions set up by various
administrations. It includes the European Union’s and national climate targets and how
they affect they every-day operation of the city. The main focus of the program is how
it affects the city’s own activities and matters which can be influenced on a municipal
level, but also takes into account importance on how residents, companies and other
organisations help achieve these goals.

23
In short terms Vaasa aims to achieve higher energy efficiency, increase usage
renewable energy resources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions levels from 1990 with
30 percent until end of 2020 and eventually achieve carbon neutrality in the year 2035
(City of Vaasa, 2015). To achieve higher efficiency Vaasa intends to decrease energy
consumption, increase the energy production efficiencies to reduce energy losses,
utilize energy storage solutions and to increase the energy awareness of the consumers.
Energy efficiency also contributes to emission reductions, but to further reduce the
emissions Vaasa intends to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources such as
solar and wind power. The plan of emission reductions also extends to the transport
sector, where Vaasa intends to increase usage of public transports to reduce the
residents private car usage.
As previously stated, Vaasa intends to increase energy awareness of consumers, which
would result in less energy consumption and emissions (City of Vaasa, 2015). This
because the largest greenhouse gas emitters in Vaasa is caused by the consumers
district heat and electricity consumption as well as the road traffic. Therefor, every
resident, company and other organizations plays a key role in the actions for Vaasa to
achieve their goals stated in the energy and climate program.
A major desired effect of this energy and climate program is to reduce emissions to
counteract the effects of global warming and create a sustainable future, but it is not
the only one. By increasing energy efficiency and lowering consumption, one can save
significantly in energy costs. The money saved can then for example be invested in
further development in to cleaner and more efficient technologies to further reduce
emissions and increase efficiency. By saving energy and lowering consumption, it
ensures that the energy supply is able to meet the energy demand, which reduces the
need for imported energy and further reduces energy costs as prices go down. The
energy and climate program also ensure that the city follows its vision of “an
international Vaasa – the Nordic energy capital”, as Vaasa has a versatile industry
within the energy sector with great expertise as well as an wide range of educational
programmes, from vocational schools to university level (City of Vaasa, 2015).

MATERIAL AND METHODS

One aim of this thesis was to collect data on energy consumption and production at
two of Wärtsila’s locations in Vasa, which are the Järvikatu facilities and the
Vaskiluoto Engine Laboratory. The energy data collected consists of electricity
consumption and production as well as the consumption of district heating. After the
data was collected, it underwent an analysis both from a technical and an economical
point of view to firstly provide an accurate reading of how much energy is consumed
or produced during a year and what costs the energy usage accumulates. This work
process will be explained in the following chapter. Much of the data collected and
information regarding the energy systems are classified by the company and will not
be presented in the published version of this thesis. The main tool for this thesis has
been Microsoft Excel.
3.1

Data collection

The data collection for this thesis has been done from several different sources, internal
as well as external, during a one year span from the beginning of September 2018 to
the end of August 2019. The internal data was gathered from inhouse energy meters,
while the external data was from energy vendors and their invoices and credit notes.
In the project over 200 invoices or credit notes have been processed and several
thousand datapoints and values have been collected. All in all, the thesis has focused
on seven different electrical connection points, of which five are consumption points
and two are production points. A third production connection exists, but was not
included in this thesis because of major rebuilds at that site which resulted in extremely
low production during the timespan focused upon in this thesis. On the district heating
side, three connection points were included in the thesis. Each connection has its
specific sheet in the Excel table for easier analysis and overview, and the total sums
are gathered on one master sheet for a total overview of consumption and costs. As
mentioned earlier in the thesis, the electricity bill is mainly divided into two parts, one
transfer part and one energy part. The transfer part is billed from the local grid operator,
which in this case are two operators, and the energy part of the bill has been handled
by two different vendors over the timespan in question. One vendor handled it in 2018

25
and another in 2019. This resulted in slight variations in fees between the two
companies, but they follow the same baselines.

3.1.1 Electrical transfer costs
Both of the local grid operators have slightly different fees and charges, which will be
listed later, both on the amount and what they are based on. However, in both cases
there are three main factors which they charge for in case of electrical consumption.
These are the total consumption for the billable period, in this case every month, the
highest power peaks and the reactive power consumption.
For company one there are the following charges:
•

A monthly meter fee

•

A distribution fee day/night in euro per kWh, which is based on the electricity
energy consumption in kWh. Day time fees are for consumption between
07.00-22.00 and then night time fees are between 22.00-07.00.

•

A demand charge in euro per kilowatt, which is billed every month and is based
on the highest one hour load peak during the last twelve months.

•

A reactive power charge in euro per kVAr per month, which is based on the
highest registered value during an hour for each month. Some of the reactive
power is duty free. For inductive load, or the outtake from grid, X percent is
duty free and on capacitive load, or the intake to grid, X percent is duty free of
the monthly highest one hour peak load.

•

Electricity taxes and security stockpile fee depending on tax category.

•

Value Added Tax

•

For electricity production to the grid there is one transfer fee based on the
amount of energy transferred in euro per kWh produced.

For company two there are the following charges:
•

A fixed monthly customer specific fee

•

A monthly connection point fee

•

Energy consumption fees in euro per MWh, which are based on the electricity

26
energy consumption in MWh. One for output from grid and one for output to
grid.
•

A fixed monthly compensation fee

•

Reactive power charges. Two charges for reactive power peaks that exceeds
the set limit both for reactive power to and from the grid in euro per MVAr.
Also an reactive energy fee in euro per MVArh is paid on the surplus reactive
energy.

•

A fee to the main grid owner Fingrid Oyj is paid in euro per MWh, which is
called Powerplant short operating time energy fee

•

Value Added Tax

The information for electrical transfer costs have been gathered and compiled in Excel
from monthly invoices for each connection. These fees and charges are quite straight
forward. The amount is usually fixed for a whole year, with changes in tariffs being
made at the end of a year. The only variable unit is the energy amount which varies
every month. Here follows a few tables which illustrates with fictious numbers how
the information has been gathered and compiled in Excel. Table. 8 below shows an
example of the table model used for electricity consumption

Table 9. Electricity production and transfer cost example

3.1.2 Electrical energy costs and sales
As an opposite of the transfer fees which are straight forward, the fees, charges and
sales price are much more complex. From the company that is handling the energy buy
and sales for Wärtsilä, only a couple of fees are constant during a whole year. The rest,
which are portfolio fees, trading costs and derivatives/clearing, are based on the market
value, trading commissions and the market price of electrical energy. Due to the fact
that they are market dependent, it results in that they vary heavily every month.
The two fees that are constant during a year are mark-up price or margin price and
Fingrid fee. The Fingrid fee is an energy consumption fee paid to Fingrid via the
electricity vendor for imbalance power. Through Fingrid’s balance services, the
customer, in this case the vendor, balances the difference between its electricity
acquisition and electricity supply by means of imbalance power and obtains the
services related to imbalance settlement which determines the electricity deliveries
between the parties operating in the electricity market. The mark-up price is added into
the total cost incurred by the vendor in order to cover the costs of doing business and
create a profit.
On the electrical energy sales and purchases information has been gathered from
invoices, credit notes for sales and cost reports from the electricity vendor. As for the
transfer costs, the table model used for the data collection on the electrical energy part
will now be illustrated with fictious numbers. Firstly the energy costs will be presented
in Table. 10.

3.1.3 Internal electrical energy meters
To acquire accurate data for further assessments of the energy usage, information was
gathered from internal electrical energy meters in the company’s facilities. The reason
behind this is the fact that not all of the produced electrical energy derived from engine
testing and factory acceptance tests are sold to the electrical grid. A small amount of
the produced electricity is used as the facilities internal consumption in different
processes. A large part of the produced electricity, at least for the time period which
was investigated, was consumed in large resistors or load banks. These load banks
consume and dissipate the electrical power produced by the engine’s generators. They
are for example used in certain types of engine testing and running curves where grid
connection cannot be applicable. That can include ramping curves which produce
frequency fluctuations or simply that the engine running speed is not high enough to

29
produce the required frequency for grid connection. The load banks are also used when
the grid capacity output is reached. These are the situations when there is so much
electricity produced that the existing setup of transformers and frequency converters
connected to the grid don’t have enough capacity to consume ell the electric energy,
so parts of the produced energy has to be consumed by the load banks.
3.1.4 Hourly production and consumption
From the local grid operator that the Järvikatu facilities are connected to it was possible
to get hourly load data for both electricity production and consumption. In the project
the main focus were on data for total production and consumption, meaning that the
focus was not on excessively done on specific connections instead an overall view of
all connections together. The data were presented graphically in Excel for a week at a
time for easier analysis of production/consumption trends and patterns. An example
model of the graph is shown in Figure.3 below.

Figure 3. Hourly production and consumption example graph

The energy unit and the actual amount have purposely been left out, as the vital part
is to illustrate what the graph looks like. On the x-axis is the time and on the y-axis is
electrical energy sum of both consumption and production. Production is represented
as negative values and consumption with positive values. This meaning that when the
curve is on the negative side of the axis the production amount is much higher than the
consumption and vice versa when the curve is on the positive side. The company has
a constant electrical consumption, while the production varies according to engine test
schedules. Therefore, the curve fluctuates greatly from day to day and this is well
illustrated in the graph.

30

3.1.5 District heating
In the existing setup, district heating plays a huge role in the different processes in the
company’s facilities. Some of these applications are heating of HVAC, preheating of
engines and heating of fuels etc. There are three district heating connections that have
been included in this thesis and data have been collected accordingly. One of the
connections is located at the Vaskiluoto facility and the remaining two connections,
one large and one small, are located at the Järvikatu facilities. The smaller connection
is mainly for building heating purposes while the larger one is used also for engine
testing purposes. The information needed for the thesis has been collected from
monthly district heating invoices from the vendor. Costwise, district heating is
straightforward. There are only two charges; one energy consumption charge in euro
per MWh and one basic fee in euro per month. The basic fee is essentially a connection
fee, whose quantity is dependent on the size of the connection. The larger the
connection is, so is the basic connection fee. Using fictious numbers, the following
table illustrate the table models used for the data collection on the three different
district heating connections.

Data analysis

Various analyses have been done on the data collected on the district heating and
electrical energy usage. One of the main goals of the analyses was to get an overall
view of the total energy usage in terms of costs and earnings as well as the energy
consumption and production for the two locations over a one year period. From there
the analyses could be broken down in different segments for further deeper analysis,
where questions such as which energy form, between district heat and electricity, is
larger both costwise and energy in terms of energy consumption could be answered.
Another goal was to find potential problem areas and deviations from the expected
usage trend. These deviations includes reactive power consumption and if there is
larger consumption at one connection point than it theoretically should. These
deviation markers could indicate that there is some fault or underlying problems that
needs to be corrected when moving to the new facilities. In general the intention of all
analyses is to locate areas where the company can improve and optimize their energy
usage, to improve efficiency and reducing energy costs.

3.2.1 Electrical energy storage possibility
A part of the data analysis was to investigate the possibility of using battery packs as
an energy storage system at the new location. For this investigation one testing facility
was chosen, which has both electrical consumption and production. Two different
scenarios were considered, one where the stored energy is used during night time and
one where the stored energy is used for consumption peak shaving. The night time
operation was considered to be between 22.00-07.00 in this scenario. In both cases it
is considered that all produced electricity is used to charge the battery pack. How the
two scenarios were investigated and calculated will be explained as follows.
For both scenarios the data used is hourly energy load data for a whole year for both
electrical production and consumption for the testing facility. In both scenarios highly
generic technical data on battery packs where assumed, since manufacturers are not
keen on having their technical specifications open for the public. The information on
the battery packs that where assumed were the energy capacity, depth of discharge

32
(DOD) and inverter efficiency. The depth of discharge is a factor of the amount of
energy that can be utilized from the total capacity of the battery pack, meaning that
one cannot completely drain the stored energy. The DOD is meant to extend the life
cycle of the battery. There are some losses in the inverter when it converts the stored
DC current to AC current, and hence there is an efficiency coefficient for the inverter.
The rated capacity was assumed to be 5 MWh, the DOD to be 0.95 and the inverter
efficiency to be 0.97.
For the night time consumption Excel’s functions COUNTIF and AVERAGE were
used to determine three parameters which is listed below:

Energy calculation tool

An energy calculation tool has been constructed in Excel where one can manipulate
energy usage. The intent of the tool is to see how different usage scenarios would affect
the total energy costs for a year and use the data collected for the project as a base in
the calculations. The base values used are the total amounts for consumption,
production, net costs and net sales for a whole year. Only variable cost are taken into
consideration with the tool, since the fixed costs such as meter fees are not affected by
different energy usage scenarios. A yearly average value for the spot price was
assumed for easier calculations. Trading costs, clearing values and portfolio fees were
left out, because they are too market dependent which results in large fluctuations.

34
Therefore, it is problematic to get a trustworthy average value for a whole year. These
limitations and assumptions contribute to the fact that the calculations are not exactly
accurate. However, they give a good approximation on how the different scenarios
would affect the energy usage costs.
The tool also takes into consideration the environmental aspects of the different
scenarios in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. By increasing the efficiency with
manipulation of the different scenarios, the tool gives an estimate on carbon dioxide
emission reduction. This will be explained further later in this subchapter.
As previously mentioned, the tool uses total values as a base and the information used
from the data collected will be explained hereafter. The total electricity consumption
is both the billed electricity consumption and the internal consumption from the
facilities’ own produced electricity. The next factor is the total electricity production,
which includes all the generated electricity from the engines. The total reactive power
consumption has also been included even if its costs are marginal compared to the total
energy usage costs. The last factor is the total district heating consumption.
In the calculation tool there are four values that it is possible to create different
scenarios by either increasing or decreasing the values by button pressing, using the
Excel’s Spin button developer add-in. The four values that can be manipulated are the
following:
•

The percentage of produced electricity used for own consumption

•

The percentage of produced electricity used in resistors / load banks

•

The reactive power compensation percentage

•

The percentage of heating needs produced by internal processes

Figure. 4 below shows an example of the layout of the tool where one can manipulate
the values.

Figure 4. Energy calculation tool layout

35
The calculations for the distribution of own internally produced electricity used the
following datasets and the corresponding formulas (9-12) are shown in Appendix 2:
Table 15. Internally produced electricity distribution datasets

The internal consumption value is achieved by multiplying the actual total electricity
production with the set percentage of internal consumption. That value is then
subtracted from the total electricity consumption to leave the amount of electrical
energy that is billable from network operators and market vendors.
The billable consumption is then divided in half to calculate an assumed day and night
time consumption, which is then multiplied by their respective transfer fees to get the
transfer costs. The assumption is made for easier calculations, but in reality the
majority of the consumption occurs during the day time as more business sectors and
processes are active during the day. The total billable consumption is multiplied by the
assumed average spot market price, the margin price and the Fingrid fee to receive an
estimate on electrical energy cost, shown in Figure. 5 with fictious numbers below.
Table. 16 shows the datasets used in the economical calculations and the
corresponding formulas (13-16) are shown in Appendix 2.

From the total produced electricity, the internal consumption and the resistor
consumption are subtracted to receive the produced electricity which is available for
grid sales. That amount is then multiplied with the average spot market price to get the
production sales and then also multiplied with the Fingrid fee and margin sales price
to get the production sales costs.
For the reactive power one can change how many percent of the total reactive power
consumption is compensated. The remaining percentage is then the reactive power
amount which is liable for consumption charges, as shown in Appendix 2 with
formulas 17-19. The following datasets are used in the calculations:

From these calculations all the costs are added together and compared to sales profits
to get the difference between costs and sales. This gives the final loss/profit from
electricity usage. The calculated total electricity costs, total sales and their difference

is also compared to the actual electricity usage to get a cost save estimate by
manipulating the different factors. The datasets for these calculations are shown in

Next up in the calculation tool are the district heating costs. The plan is that in the new
facilities district heating consumption from external supplier should be lowered by
utilizing feedback loops and heat recovery systems to collect excess heat from internal
processes and in that way replace existing consumption needs from the district heating
network. The calculations are based on an yearly average volumetric flow on heat
consumption, derived from the total consumption volume and running hours in a year
In the calculation tool this is done as follows, illustrated with fictious values. The
datasets used in the district heating calculations are shown in Table. 19 and the
corresponding formulas (23-32) are shown in Appendix 2.

The average volumetric flow is assumed to be outgoing flow to new facilities heating
needs and the average volumetric flow is the sum of incoming district heat flow and
heat flow from internal heating processes. Both separate incoming flows are multiplied
by yearly running hours go get a total consumption volume estimate for both flows.
These volumes are then multiplied by an average energy density factor, derived from
total energy consumption and total consumption volume, to get the energy
consumption for both flows.

Figure 8. Heating calculations part 2

The calculated energy consumption from the district heating network is then multiplied
by the consumption fee to get an cost estimate. This estimate is compared to the actual
district heating costs for look up of potential cost reductions.
From an economical point of view, the last part in the calculation tool is to compare
the total overall costs and earnings whit each other. Meaning comparing the difference
between the total sums for the calculated scenario and the actual scenario at the
existing facility. The datasets used in the calculations are shown in Table. 20 and the

3.3.1 Emission calculations
The calculation tool takes into consideration carbon dioxide emission reductions from
different scenarios, by utilizing collected numbers from Finland overall in 2019 on
specific carbon dioxide emissions in g CO2 / kWh for both electricity production and
district heat production. By using the specific carbon dioxide emission factors and
multiplying them to both actual consumption and calculated scenario consumption and
comparing the results, one gets an estimate on emission reduction.
On the electricity side the emission reduction is considered as follows. Wärtislä’s
electricity production always produce emissions, but by lowering the amount of
resistor consumption one can lower unnecessary emission. Because all energy
consumed in the resistors only produces heat that goes out to the atmosphere. But by
reducing the resistor consumption and instead increasing internal consumption or
supply to grid, the energy consumed is used in a useful way and not resulting in just
heat losses. Therefor on electricity the emission reduction is considered as reduction
on unnecessary emission and not on the total production emissions.
By utilizing excess heat from internal processes to accommodate the facilities heating
needs, which in the existing facilities is done by district heating, the district heat
consumption is lowered. By reducing the district heat consumption, the district heat
production from the supplier should also be reducing, which in turn results in less
emissions from the district heat production by the supplier.
These are the factors that are taken into consideration in the tool calculations. By
varying the resistor consumption and heat consumption from internal processes, one
gets the difference in emissions as illustrated in Figure. 12 below with fictious values.
The datasets used in the calculations are shown in Table. 21 and the corresponding
formulas (39-45) in Appendix 2.

RESULTS

The results and findings obtained from the analyses and calculations done in the
previous chapter will be presented in this chapter and the following subchapters. The
results and findings will be presented in the same order as the analyses, and the
majority will be presented with percentual differences and indicators, since the
majority of the actual results and numbers are classified by the company.
4.1

Electrical energy usage

Table. 22 below shows the allocation of the total yearly consumption for each
connection, as well as what percentage of the total electricity cost the consumption
corresponds to. The majority of the consumption amounts and trends are according to
expectations, except for Consumption connection 1 which is highlighted in Table. 22
and Table. 23, and the reason why will be explained later. Otherwise the consumption
amount follows according to what was expected; which means that the connection with
largest consumption processes connected to it also have greatest consumption of
electricity.

Consumption connection 1 is highlighted because of two reasons. The first reasons is
that in an ideal solution, there would not be any consumption on that connection, only
production. The consumption on this connection mainly comes from no-load losses in
energized transformers and frequency converters while they are idle. The transformers

42
are idle and energized during the time that no load is produced by the engines’
generators. As long as the transformers are energized, they constantly consume
electricity. The second reason why Consumption connection 1 is highlighted is
because it consumes the majority of consumed reactive power. The cause of this is
connected to reason one. Because there are so many transformers connected to that
connection, it consumes vast amounts of reactive power, both with and without load.
As can be seen in Tables. 22 and 23, the relation between consumed reactive power
and consumed electrical energy is significantly higher in Consumption connection 1
than the rest of the connections. Consumption connection 1 consumes 179 kVAr /
MWh of consumed electrical energy, while the second highest is Consumption
connection 3 with 3.8 kVAr / MWh. From this relation it is clear that the reaction
power is a small problem area on Consumption connection 1, which in the new
facilities needs to be optimized. The no-load losses are a necessary evil, since that is
the way how the system functionality is built, and over a one year span the
consumption is not so vast.
Tables. 24 below shows the total distribution of produced electricity during the year
investigated. The majority of the produced electricity is supplied to the local grid and
is a positive result. By supplying it to the local grid, it can be utilized as useful energy
by the local grid operator and does not contribute to any large losses and by selling the
energy, the company reduces the overall energy costs. Production connection 1
produces the most electricity in total and thus also distributes more electricity to both
grid and to resistors. The production to resistors / load banks are rather large as well
as the production to the facilities own consumption is rather small in comparison. This
is a situation that needs to be optimized in the new facilities to achieve a more
beneficial setup. By reducing the resistor consumption and increasing the own
consumption from produced electricity, the company will be more energy efficient,
lowering the unnecessary emissions as more energy is utilized as useful energy as well
as reducing economical energy costs.
Table 24. Distribution of internally produced electricity

43
Since Production connection 1 produces and distributes more electricity to the grid
than Production connection 2, it is not surprising that it also accumulates the majority
of the profits from the electrical energy sales. This can be seen in Table. 24.
4.2

District heating usage

For the district heat usage no real surprises occurred. Consumption amount is followed
according connection size, so District heat connection 1 which is significantly larger
than the two other consumes a vast majority of the total district heat consumption. The
significant difference in consumption amount can be seen in Table. 27. A month by
month consumption comparison is shown in Figure. 13 below. The left-hand y-axis is
for District heat connection 2 and 3, while the right-hand y-axis is for District heat
connection 1. In the figure it is shown that the consumption trend curves for each
connections follows each other well. The curve rises during the colder months of the
year and decreases during the warmer months. From this it can be concluded that there
should not be any leakage or abnormal consumption on any connection, for example,
if there was a sudden consumption increase during the summer months. Because
during the summer months the heating needs are low as well as limited ongoing
production due to vacations, and hence there should be low consumption.
Table 25. District heating consumption and costs

44

Figure 10. Monthly district heating usage comparison

4.3

Overall energy usage

From an overall standpoint of view, electrical energy stands for the majority of both
energy consumption and energy costs. This can be seen in Table. 28 below. In terms
of euro per MWh, district heating costs about 30 percent less than electricity per MWh.
However, district heating prices are constant during the whole year while electrical
energy prices fluctuates greatly. Depending on the market variations and weather over
a year, the electricity costs could be closer to the district heat costs or even larger than
they were for the year investigated.

Total

Total energy consumption (MWh) Percentage of total costs

100%

It was concluded that almost all energy costs are variable costs with only four percent
being fixed costs. This means that all monthly fees such as connection and meter fees
do not have a great impact on the total energy costs for a whole year. Instead all
variable costs such as consumption fees and market prices stands for the majority of
the costs. It are these variable costs which needs to be addressed if one wants to lower
the overall energy costs for the company.

4.4

Electrical energy storage

As earlier mentioned in the thesis, two different scenarios on one connection were
investigated on the possibility of utilizing electrical energy storage solutions. The first
scenario was to charge battery packs and use the stored electrical energy during
nighttime, when consumption is lower. The second scenario was utilizing battery
packs in a peak-shaving setup, where the stored energy would be used to reduce
consumption peaks and keep more constant consumption level which in this case was
set at yearly average consumption level. Figure. 14 and 15 shows what the peak
shaving scenario would look like.

Figure 11. Electricity curve without peak-shaving

Figure 12. Electricity curve with peak-shaving

46
Table. 27 shows the results from the calculations of the two potential electrical energy
storage scenarios. As the table shows, both from an energy and economical point of
view it is more beneficial to utilize energy storage to replace night-time energy
consumption bought from the local grid and energy vendors.

Scenario
Reduction in bought electrical energy (%) Energy cost reduction (%)
Night-time consumption
32.20
29.72
Peak-shaving

19.47

The table shows that both scenarios are a possible solution to reduce electrical energy
consumption from the grid by utilizing stored internally produced electricity. Both
scenarios would also reduce the energy costs of bought electricity.
However, one must keep in mind that these numbers are only for that individual
connection and not for the total consumption. For that specific connection the
reduction numbers are good, as in the night-time consumption scenario the
consumption would reduce almost by third over a whole year. When one considers
reduction in total energy consumption from all other connections as well, the reduction
is not as great. Of course utilizing energy storage on the specific connection in question
would have an impact on total energy consumption and cost for all connections, but
the impact would be an reduction of three to five percent for both energy consumption
and costs. This is shown in Table. 28 below.

Energy tool calculations

Several different scenarios where tested in the project using the energy calculation tool
that was created. For this thesis four different scenarios are presented to illustrate the
impact on reductions for energy costs and unnecessary carbon emissions the scenarios
have. The four different scenarios and their parameters used in the tool are presented
in Table. 29 below. For comparison the actual as-is situation parameters are presented

47
as well, to get a better understanding on how the scenarios differs from the actual
consumption.

In Table. 30 the results from the scenarios are presented. Each scenario and how they
differ from the actual setup will be thoroughly explained, but firstly the parameter
outputs will be explained. The difference in electricity sales means the percental
difference in electricity sales when the amount of sold electricity is either increased or
decreased. Simply put, does the sales profit increase or decrease. Second is the
reduction in consumption costs, which is the percental reduction of both electrical and
district heat consumption costs. The reduction in total energy costs is as the name says
the percental reduction of the sum of all energy costs minus the electrical sales profits,
meaning it includes both electrical and district heat consumption costs as well as
electrical production costs.

4.5.1 Calculation scenario 1
In scenario 1, six percent of the electricity sold to grid has been internally consumed
instead, otherwise the scenario follows the actual setup of electricity distribution and
district heat consumption. As can be expected, by reducing the amount of electricity
sold to the grid the electricity sales will also reduce. As the internal consumption
increases from own production, the electrical consumption costs will reduce and in

48
turn reduces the overall consumption costs. However, it will not affect the total energy
costs significantly which is illustrated in the table. The reasons behind this is that even
if one reduce both consumption and production costs, the coherent reduction in sales
profits results in that the total energy costs stay roughly the same. Also this scenario
do not result in any reduction of unnecessary emissions, since the resistor consumption
is the same as the actual setup and no internal heat production is existent. So the same
amount of district heat has to be produced by the supplier, and even if the internal
electrical consumption from own production is increased the corresponding loss in
grid sales has to be produced by another electricity supplier to the grid. Hence the same
emissions are emitted and no reduction in unnecessary emissions.
4.5.2 Calculation scenario 2
In scenario 2, the electricity distribution of own produced electricity is the same as for
the actual setup. Instead 20 percent of the district heating needs has been replaced with
internal heating processes. By replacing district heat consumption with internal heating
processes both the consumption costs as well as the total energy costs goes down. In
Table. 30 it is shown that for this scenario there is an almost seven percent reduction
in consumption costs and over ten percent reduction in total energy costs. The reason
why the total energy costs has reduced more than the consumption costs are because
the grid sales have stayed the same as the actual setup. With less consumption costs
and the same grid sales, the difference between costs and profits have decreased and
hence the total energy costs have reduced. With this scenario there have also been a
significant reduction in unnecessary emissions, over 14 percent which roughly
corresponds to three percent of the industrial process and production emissions levels
of 2017 in Vaasa. From this result it is clear that the more heating needs that can be
produced internally from other processes excess heat, the more the unnecessary
emissions would reduce. When the company increases their utilization of excess heat
and etc. the district heat supplier have less heating demand to fulfill and reduces their
emissions.
4.5.3 Calculations scenario 3
In scenario 3, seven percent of the electricity consumed in resistor has been redistributed with four percent to internal consumption and three percent added to grid

49
sales. No heating needs has been replaced by internal processes in this scenario. As
can be seen in Table. 30, this scenario setup has resulted in both an increase in sales
profits as well as reductions in consumption costs and total energy costs. By reducing
the resistor consumption, the unnecessary emissions have also reduced by roughly the
percentage as he resistor consumption reduction. These results gives an clear
indication of that the electricity consumption in the resistors are efficient and
sustainable solution from both an economical and an environmental point of view. The
electricity consumed in the resistors only result in heat losses and the energy consumed
is only useful in engine testing purposes and cannot be utilized by another processes.
Additionally, this also result in a lot of unnecessary emissions.
4.5.4 Calculation scenario 4
The energy distribution for scenario 4 is an theoretical estimate on how the company
would like the distribution to look like in new facilities in the future. Half of the heating
needs are produced internally and all resistor consumption have been substituted with
grid sales and internal consumption. The majority, or 80 percent, of the produced
electricity is sold to the grid while the remaining 20 percent is consumed internally. In
Table. 30 it is illustrated that this setup would have great impact on energy costs and
emission reductions. This setup would increase the grid sales by 40 percent and reduce
the consumption costs by almost a third, which in turn would lower the total energy
costs by over half, or 64 percent. Unnecessary emissions would also reduce by 64
percent, which would account for almost one percent of Vaasa’s total emission levels
in 2017 and over twelve percent of the industrial process and production emission
levels. From these results it is clear that the company have a great potential to reduce
both energy costs and unnecessary emissions significantly in the new facilities. It takes
some investments to reach these setup goals, but the reductions would give good
payback potential financially as well as making the company more energy efficient
hence increasing their efforts in the battle against global warming.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this project was to investigate the energy usage for electricity and
district heating at the existing facilities, and the possibilities on how to improve the
energy usage at the new facilities. These needed to be done from technical, economic
and environmental standpoints to get a deeper understanding of the company’s energy
usage. By doing so, this study follows the intentions of the city of Vaasa in 2015 to
decrease energy consumption, increase the energy production efficiencies to reduce
energy losses, utilize energy storage solutions and to increase the energy awareness of
the consumers. These regional plans reflects a national (Huttunen, 2017) and
international (MOE, 2020) endeavour to reduce emissions and develop carbon neutral
societies.
Based on the results of this project, the company now have a better understanding of
what their yearly energy usage costs are and where they have areas which needs
improvements when they move to the new facilities. By looking at the results from the
data analyses and calculations, one can assess that the existing energy usage setup is
slightly out of date. There are a fair amount of energy consumption that could be
handled internally by the company’s own energy production instead of buying the
energy from an external supplier. Both on the electrical side and the district heating
side there are considerable amounts of energy losses where the energy could be utilized
in a better way. When looking at the total electricity consumption for the company,
one can make the assessment that the total amount is in the range of what an industry
complex of this size should have even if it is outdated. The electricity consumption
amount corresponds to roughly 21 percent of Vaasa’s industry sectors’ electricity
consumption in 2018. It is expected that Wärtsilä’s share of the industries’ electricity
consumption would be large, since Wärtsilä is the biggest industry company in Vaasa.
On the electrical side the resistor consumption is in fact nearly only an energy loss,
since the resistors convert the electrical energy to heat that goes into the atmosphere.
Indeed, for some certain types of engine tests they are needed when it is not possible
for the generators to be connected to the grid. However, in the as-is situation a majority
of resistor consumption comes from the fact that the grid connections’ capacities

51
cannot handle all electrical energy that is produced. In the new facilities the grid
capacity will be higher as well as the capabilities for internal consumption, which
means that less electrical energy will be consumed in resistors and instead utilized as
useful energy, either internally or by local grid consumers. Theoretically one would
achieve the largest cost savings by consuming all produced electricity internally.
However, that is not an liable solution mainly because of two reasons. Firstly the
electrical system setup becomes more complex to be able to consume all produced
electricity and distribute it according to need across the new facility. Secondly, in
correspondence with the first reason, is that the internal electricity production is not
steady. Electricity production heavily fluctuates according to engine testing schedule
where one possibly have large production for a couple of hours and then suddenly no
production for a couple of days. Therefore, one cannot achieve a steady and sustainable
production without making large changes in engine testing schedule which affects the
company’s main business operation.
In terms of district heating, there are a lot of energy losses where energy could be
utilized in a more efficient way. For the company district heat is used in many other
applications and processes than just building heat. However, with all the processes
active in the company’s facilities there are vast amounts of heat generated that in the
existing setup are not utilized. By recovering this excess heat and utilizing it by feeding
it back to the heating system, the company could significantly lower the consumption
of district heat and by that also lowering energy costs as well as emissions. The effects
of this possibility is clearly shown in the results for Calculation scenario 4.
When it comes to the energy storage, the utilization of heat storage is meant to be
implemented in the new facilities. This will be done in the form of heat recovery and
feedback loops to the heat system, where hot water will be stored in a tank for easier
regulation according to heating needs. However, the potential case of electrical energy
storage is still under investigation. As the calculations done for this project shows, the
possibility of electrical energy storage exists and would have an impact on reducing
energy consumption and costs. The main issue with this solution, as stated by Xia, et
al., 2018, is that battery packs are very expensive, especially with the capacity needed
for an industry facility of this size. Accordingly, there is need to further investigate

52
where the breakpoint is to find the best solution of storage capacity and price, so that
the payback time is not too long. By finding the right setup, the company can then
further invest in battery packs to further improve energy efficiency and usage in their
facilities.
As previously established, as long as the company tests and produces engines for
marine and power solutions there will always be emissions emitted. Wärtsilä always
aims to improve their engines to reduce emissions and researching new fuels.
However, there have not been too much focus earlier on the fact that the existing
energy usage contributes to the abundance of unnecessary emissions on their
secondary products derived from their processes, which are electrical energy and heat.
By improving their energy usage in the new facilities, the company can contribute
further in the battle against global warming as well as further contributing to the city
of Vaasa’s goals for a cleaner and more energy efficient city. As the city of Vaasa
declared in 2015, the largest greenhouse gas emitters in Vaasa is caused by the
consumers district heat and electricity consumption as well as the road traffic.
Therefore, by improving their energy usage in these areas, Wärtsilä will contribute to
both local and global goals.
With the improvements in the energy system setups the company achieves higher
flexibility of their systems, by integrating both electricity and heat more with each
other and improving the flexibility on the individual systems. This corresponds to the
statements made by Paiho, et al., 2018, that additional flexibility is created by
connecting electricity, heating, cooling and transport sectors together. By being more
self-sustaining in their energy usage and with more flexible and smarter system setups,
the company will contribute to the trend of decreasing energy consumption and
emissions in Finland. By utilizing existing internally produced energy in the company
in a smarter way and thus reducing the energy demand from the suppliers, the suppliers
can lower their production and thus also lower their emissions. The energy
consumption decrease on a nationwide level will happen through the reduction of
existing double production of energy. The double energy production in this case refers
to the fact that parts of the energy amount of the company’s heating needs, which is
supplied from external sources, exists internally in the company’s operations but is not

53
utilized at the current time. This is also the case for the electricity consumed in the
resistors. All electrical energy that is consumed in the resistors that could potentially
be utilized elsewhere, however, is currently produced by external suppliers instead.
Do however note that part of the calculations are based on estimations and average
values, such as an average yearly spot market price. These estimations are mainly
derived from yearly fluctuations in values affected by several different factors such as
market variations, and are therefore hard to calculate with exact values. Accordingly,
the calculations are more of an approximation. They do however provide a good
indication on what the possibilities are and the impact they would have on the energy
usage. To create more accurate calculations would be a highly time consuming and
complex task given the vast amounts of data and fluctuations. This is especially the
case, such as in this thesis, if the focus is on the energy usage for the whole facilities.
In this thesis, the focus has been on whole facilities with the highest energy usage
which are affected by the facility relocation, which where the Järvikatu and Vaskiluoto
Engine Laboratory facilities. While not a part of this thesis, it would be possible to
achieve more specific results if the focus would be a smaller segment or particular part
of these facilities.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

It is clear that Wärtsilä has a great potential to reduce the energy costs, reduce
emissions as well as improving the company’s energy usage in a smarter way, and this
thesis and the underlying project serve as a background for that. The relocation of the
business operations in the centrum of Vaasa to the new facilities in Vaskiluoto is
therefore an excellent opportunity for these improvements. When planning both the
building and the building’s processes simultaneously, it tends to be easier than trying
to rebuild a process in an old building.
There have been some challenges in working on this thesis and the project itself. One
challenge was the classification of data. This classification resulted in parallel work
processes where reporting of the actual findings was done to the company and a
redacted version of the findings in the thesis. With restrictions on what results, data,
names etc. could be published, it was difficult to write a coherent and clear thesis where
the reader could follow and understand the work process and the associated results.
Another challenge was the vast amounts of data, where much of it was heavily variable
and fluctuating. This resulted in difficulties getting specific and exact results in the
different calculations, and instead, the findings became more of an approximate
estimate. However, the estimates have been done with credible methods and
assumptions, so the findings should not stray too far away from the truth.
This thesis and the underlying project are, as earlier mentioned, a fairly broad and
overall investigation of the energy usage with a great potential for further research.
Firstly, to get more accurate results one can focus on one specific object area instead
of a whole location. By doing so, it is easier to counteract data fluctuations in the
calculations and to get a more detailed result. Secondly, when the new facilities are up
and running, it is possible to do a follow up and re-evaluation of the results from this
thesis and project. When the new facilities are up and running and the improvements
have been done, it is possible to follow up how the new setup has impacted the energy
usage. Then is it possible to evaluate if the calculation and analysis results in this thesis
were accurate long term and if the goals of energy, emission and cost reductions for
the company have been accomplished.

55

Not only does this thesis offer guidance for other of the company’s business areas
around the world, but it might be helpful for other companies as well. This thesis
highlights the importance for companies to investigate their energy usage. In line with
the global demands for a more sustainable future, it is worthwhile to investigate the
potential affects of improving the internal energy systems.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
Kontroll och optimering av energianvändning inom ett företag. En fallstudie
Inledning
Gällande dagens energifrågor eftersträvar man att förbättra redan existerande
teknologier och att producera nya, grönare teknologier för att skapa en miljövänlig och
hållbar framtid. Som ett resultat av restriktioner på växthusgasutsläpp för att motverka
global uppvärmning, globala och lokala mål för kolneutrala samhällen samt ökande
krav på energieffektivitet bör företag nu se över deras energianvändning och hur de
ska uppfylla dessa mål. Dessa mål ställer också krav på att energisystemen behöver
vara mera flexibla för att upprätthålla en hållbar produktion.
De aktuella behovet att se över den egna energianvändningen berör även Wärtsilä, som
det här arbetet utförts för. I och med deras planer på att flytta verksamheten inne i
Vasa centrum till nya lokaler i Vasklot uppstod frågan om deras energianvändning.
Målet med detta arbete var att fastställa den årliga energianvändningen och därmed
också de årliga energikostnaderna. Vidare diskuteras även företagets möjligheter att
förbättra energianvändningen, minska utsläpp och vara mer ekonomiskt lönsamt.
Resultatbehandlingen i detta arbete har varit tudelad, på grund av sekretessbeläggning
från företaget, med parallell rapportering åt företaget och universitetet. I denna
avhandling presenteras redigerade resultat medan företaget har erhållit de oredigerade
resultaten. Denna redigering har skett i form av pseudonymer, fiktiva värden eller med
procentuella variationer istället för korrekta värden.
Denna avhandling och det underliggande arbetet fokuserar på energianvändningen
gällande elektricitet och fjärrvärme. Även om testning och tillverkning av motorer
samt kringliggande utrustning för kraftverk och fartyg är företagets huvudprodukter,
spelar även elektricitet och fjärrvärme en viktig roll i verksamheten. Deras verksamhet
både konsumerar och producerar stora mängder elektricitet och detsamma gäller för
fjärrvärme och överskottsvärme. Arbetsprocessen för detta arbete var uppdelat i tre
olika delar. Första delen var att undersöka energilandskapet i Finland och hur trender

57
i energianvändning har sett ut de senaste 10 åren. Detta utgör bakgrundsteori för
avhandlingen samt en baslinje för del två. Del två bestod av att samla information och
data om företagets användning av elektricitet och fjärrvärme i de existerande lokalerna.
Vidare skulle denna information och data sedan analyseras. I del tre användes
resultaten från tidigare delar som bakgrund för att identifiera nyckelfaktorer och
områden som företaget behöver förbättra i de nya lokalerna för att skapa ett effektivare
och mera lönsamt energisystem.
Syfte
Syftet med detta arbete var att få en helhetsbild över användningen av elektricitet och
fjärrvärme samt att få en bättre förståelse av de faktorer som påverkar
energianvändningen och dess kostnader. Utgående från denna helhetsbild kan man
sedan kartlägga problematiska områden eller användningssituationer som är i behov
av förbättringar eller ytterligare analyser. Vidare undersöks också hur förbättringarna
av energianvändningen påverkar mängden onödiga utsläpp och hur detta reflekterar
och bidrar till staden Vasas klimatmål.
Material och metoder
Ett mål med detta arbete har varit att samla ihop data från både interna och externa
källor om företagets energianvändning och energiproduktion under ett års tid vid två
av deras verksamhetsställen i Vasa. Dessa var anläggningarna vid Träskgatan och
Vaskiluoto Engine Laboratory i Vasklot. Informationen har erhållits från interna
mätare och fakturor från energiförsäljare och lokala elnätsinnehavare. Tidsperioden är
från september 2018 till augusti 2019. De samlade data sammanställdes sedan i
Microsoft Excel för vidare analyser och undersökningar. En av huvudanalyserna var
att ta reda på de totala energikostnaderna som uppstod under ett år. Företaget
konsumerar stora mängder elektricitet och fjärrvärme och producerar stora mängder
elektricitet genom sina motortester.

58
I detta arbete ingår sammanlagt tio stycken anslutningar. Tre stycken är
fjärrvärmeanslutningar, fem stycken är anslutningar för elkonsumtion från elnätet och
de två sista elproduktionsanslutningar till elnätet. I och med den energi som köps in
och den energi som företaget säljer i form av elektricitet, fanns det ett behov att
kartlägga alla kostnader och inkomster för att få en bild över det slutliga ekonomiska
resultatet av energianvändningen. Från denna ekonomiska analys samt den tillhörande
informationen

gällande

mängden

energiåtgång

kunde

man

identifiera

problemområden och områden i behov av ett effektivare sätt att hantera
energiåtgången.
För detta arbete gjordes en undersökning om möjligheten för energilagring. Wärtsilä
hade redan planer på energilagring för värmeåtgången, men det fanns behov av en
undersökning om energilagring av elektricitet. Detta gjordes med beräkningar på två
teoretiska situationer för en anslutning. Den första situationen var att antingen ladda
upp batterier genom egen elproduktion och sedan använda den lagrade energin under
nattetid när konsumtionen inte är så stor. Den andra situationen var att använda
batterier för att utjämna toppbelastningen, s.k. peak shaving vilket innebär att man
använder lagrad energi under konsumtionstoppar och på så sätt håller en konstant
konsumtionsnivå i elnätet. För dessa två situationer gjordes beräkningar om
energiåtgång och inbesparningar i kostnader.
För detta arbete skapades ett beräkningsverktyg i Excel där man genom att variera ett
visst antal parametrar kan se hur olika situationer påverkar energiåtgången, dess
kostnader och onödiga utsläpp från energianvändningen. Parametrarna man kan
påverka i verktyget är hur företaget procentuellt fördelar elektriciteten som produceras
mellan försäljning till elnätet, intern konsumtion i företagets processer och konsumtion
i resistorer. Man kan även påverka den procentuella andelen av det årliga
värmebehovet som företaget själv ska producera. Med detta verktyg var det möjligt att
se hur företaget kan börja fördela sin energianvändning för att uppnå potentiellt bästa
möjliga resultat samt att se hur den planerade energianvändningen i den nya
anläggningen skiljer sig från den existerande anläggningen.

59
Resultat och diskussion
Utgående från beräkningar och analyser gjorda i detta arbete kan det konstateras att
energisystemens uppbyggnad och användningssätt i de existerande anläggningarna är
aningen föråldrade och att det finns ett verkligt behov av förbättring vid flytten till den
nya anläggningen. Inom företaget finns planer på hur man kan effektivera
användningen av värmeenergi genom återcirkulation och genom att lagra energi och
använda överloppsvärme. I de existerande anläggningarna finns det mycket
överloppsvärme som går till spillo, som i den nya anläggningen kommer tas till vara.
Detta kommer att resultera i en markant minskning i fjärrvärmekostnader och onödiga
utsläpp. I och med att företaget självt står för större delar av sitt värmebehov genom
att använda värme från interna processer, kommer produktionsbehovet för
fjärrvärmeproducenten minska och på så vis minskar deras utsläpp. Detta ökar också
effektiviteten på anläggningen då mer värmeenergi tas till vara än tidigare.
Det finns även möjligheter till förbättring gällande användningen av elenergi. I dagens
läge konsumerar resistorer stora delar av den producerade elenergin främst av två
orsaker. Den ena är att det finns vissa motortestscenarion då det inte är möjligt att ha
generatorerna anslutna till nätet på grund av att man till exempel inte uppnår en stabil
frekvens. Den andra orsaken är att kapaciteten för nätanslutning inte har varit
tillräckligt stor i de existerande anläggningarna för att man ska kunna sälja elen till
nätet, utan man har istället varit tvungen att konsumera den i resistorerna. Detta har
lett till att stora mängder elenergi har resulterat i värmeenergi som släppts ut i
atmosfären och inte använts på ett nyttigt sätt. Genom att minska andelen
resistorkonsumtion och istället öka försäljningen till nätet och den interna
konsumtionen i företagets processer, kommer företaget att markant minska
energikostnaderna och utsläppen samt effektivera energianvändningen.
I och med dessa förbättringar kommer företaget bidra till både lokala och globala mål
att motverka den globala uppvärmningen. Detta uppnås i och med minskade utsläpp
av växthusgaser och då energiförlusterna i företagets processer minskar. Vidare kan
man även genom att minska på energikostnaderna bidra till bekämpningen av den
globala uppvärmningen, då man kan satsa mer kapital på att fortsätta förbättra sina
produkter och anläggningar.
