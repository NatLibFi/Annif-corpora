Abstrakt:
The gun debate in the United States has been going on for decades. Whether or not new gun
legislation should be implemented in the wake of repeated mass shootings and the public
outrage that follows them is constantly debated, but little progress has been made in the way
of lawmaking. This thesis explores the way that differing sides of the gun debate – those for
gun control and those against – use different definitions and ways to present keywords that
are frequently used in the gun debate.
The study is an analysis of four speeches that were given by four different speakers in the
wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018. The four selected speeches have
been given by Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, both students at the school, NRA CEO
Wayne LaPierre and Republican Senator Marco Rubio. The hypothesis is that people on
opposing sides of the debate will speak about and use the keywords in the text differently.
Theoretical approaches used in the analysis include critical discourse analysis and strategic
maneuvering. The keywords have been preselected by me and include words such as gun,
Second Amendment, United States and victims.
The analysis of the speeches shows that the speakers differed the most when speaking about
guns, laws and the United States. Guns were presented either as objects without any agency
and therefore lacking any moral implications or as direct reasons for the mass murder of
innocents. Current laws were presented as either fundamental for American society or were
not mentioned at all, and future legislation was either referred to as desirable change,
ineffective, or as oppression of the rights of American citizens and a slippery slope towards
the complete banning of firearms. On the other hand, the ways in which each speaker
referred to the victims of the shooting were very similar, and the name of the gunman was
not mentioned in any of the speeches. Issues that would have been more difficult to deal with
by each speaker, depending on the side of the debate they represent, were frequently left out
of the speeches. Hogg and Gonzalez, for example, never mention what should happen to
weapons already in circulation if gun ownership is banned, nor do they bring up their
thoughts about the Second Amendment. LaPierre and Rubio, on the other hand, while vocal
about the harms of introducing new gun legislation, fail to mention what should be done to
prohibit criminals from having continued access to firearms.
It would appear that there is no clear solution to the gun debate on the horizon. The different
attitudes towards gun control that predominate the discussion are recycling the same
arguments in each debate, which would appear to have brought the issue to a standstill.
Whether or not the number of mass shootings will lessen in the coming years can only be
determined by how actively the gun control activists fight for their cause, and how strongly
gun owners and the NRA will continue to resist their efforts.

Introduction

The gun control debate continues to be a hot topic in the United States of America.
Mass shootings frequently make headlines within and without the nation, and the
most shocking ones are then discussed publicly while people ask themselves how
such tragedies should be prevented in the future. The incidents that garner the most
media attention are typically shootings of an exceptional scale, such as the Pulse
nightclub shooting in June 2016 and the Las Vegas massacre in October 2017.
However, the most disturbing ones usually involve children getting shot in schools,
such as the infamous Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in December 2012,
in which 20 young children were fatally shot by 20-year-old Adam Lanza.
The discussions following such shootings have turned out to be extremely polarized.
Those affected by gun violence frequently express their dismay over the National
Rifle Association and politicians who, in their view, are blocking legislation that
would prevent future mass killings, while the opposing side feels that their individual
right to own firearms is being threatened on unfair grounds. The significance of the
Second Amendment in the 21st century is constantly debated, and there seems to be
no clear solution on the horizon.
In this thesis, I explore the discourses of the opposing sides regarding gun legislation
in the United States following a school shooting. The school shooting of interest in
this thesis is the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which took place
on February 14, 2018. Nicolas Cruz, a student at the high school, fatally shot 17 of
his fellow students, and wounded 17. The shooting resulted in very public activism
by some of the young survivors. This student activism eventually led to the March
for Our Lives campaign, where students and their supporters took to the streets to
protest gun violence in schools and to implore politicians to take legislative action in
order to prevent future school shootings. I conduct a discourse analysis exploring the
wordings used by two of the students who survived the shooting and went on to
speak publicly on behalf of stricter gun control, Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg.
The opposers of these measures are here represented by Senator Marco Rubio and
National Rifle Association (NRA) CEO Wayne LaPierre, who both expressed their
thoughts on the issue in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. Even
though discourse analysis on the gun debate has been done many times before,
1

Ella Nordberg
minors who have experienced school shootings themselves have rarely entered the
spotlight to express their thoughts on gun legislation. One of the aims of this thesis is
to find out whether their personal experience of the attack affects their reasoning for
more gun control.
Before turning to my analysis, I provide background information on the Second
Amendment and the general views and concerns of the opposing sides in the matter. I
discuss the role of the NRA in the debate, and the history of prior school shootings
and reactions that they have inspired. I also touch upon the importance of issue
framing and strategic maneuvering in the debate about gun control and the right to
bear arms. This backgrounding is followed by my analysis of each individual speech
given, after which I sum up my findings and offer my concluding remarks and
thoughts on future research.

2.

The Gun Culture

2.1.

The Second Amendment

The Second Amendment lies “at the heart” of the defense of gun rights (Utter &
Spitzer, 2016:xvi). Its meaning is frequently debated, and according to Utter &
Spitzer, two questions tend to predominate the discussion, namely whether the
amendment protects a state or individual right to militia service, and whether the
right of individuals to bear arms applies to states as well as the national government
(2016:274). Gun rights advocates insist that the amendment protects both the right to
keep and the right to bear arms – therefore, it supports not only states’ right to bear
arms, but individuals’ as well, since the people are the ones who “have a need to
keep arms in their homes for both self-protection as well as to maintain readiness
against a threat to the public peace” (2016:274). Supporters of the “militia
interpretation”, on the other hand, consider the amendment simply a guarantee that
states have a right to maintain militias and believe that it does not concern
individuals’ rights to own weapons – which is countered by the statement that, since
individuals are what form a militia, the amendment refers to them by extension
(Utter & Spitzer, 2016:274). Supporters of the militia interpretation then argue that
not all individuals used to qualify for the militia – one had to have been 18-45 years
of age and “have received appropriate training” (2016:275), which would negate the
2

Ella Nordberg
interpretation that the individual right to bear arms would concern everyone equally.
Another argument used by gun rights advocates is that the Second Amendment
secures the right of citizens to rebel against tyrannical governments, whereas
opposers of this view argue that no nation would guarantee its citizens the right to
overthrow “legally established institutions” (2016:275).
According to Williams, the early drafts of the Second Amendment referred to “the
Body of the People, rather than to individuals or persons” (2003:90), and that the
original legal meaning of the Second Amendment is as follows: “To ensure that The
Body of the People is prepared to resist a corrupt central government, The Body of
the People shall have the right to keep and bear arms” (2003:69). Together with the
Congress, the American people therefore had “two modes of expressing their will
about the use of political violence – representatively in the Congress and directly in
the militia” (2003:69). Williams also states that there is no modern equivalent to the
militia, which causes the confusion in the modern-day gun debate (2003:70) – and
since it does not exist, its rights cannot be legally protected (2003:272). He states that
“the Second Amendment simply cannot, under modern conditions, mean what it
meant under eighteenth-century conditions” (2003:271).
Another problem with the framing of the Second Amendment would be, according to
Williams, the complexity of the militia – which, in the 1780s, “had a dual nature: it
was raised and trained by the state to ensure its universality and its virtue, but it was
also a popular body to resist government” (2003:17). Therefore, on the one hand, the
militia had “important connections to the government” (2003:9), but on the other
hand had to “exercise independent judgment” (2003:10). The militia was therefore
neither simply a governmental institution nor a mass of individuals – it was a mixture
of both. The opposing sides of the gun debate, however, tend to emphasize only one
of these functions (2003:17). Over time, the militia developed into what is today
known as the National Guard, thereby moving from state to federal control, and since
members are no longer expected to supply their own weapons, the guarantee offered
in the Second Amendment would therefore not be threatened by the institution of gun
control (2003:110).
When it comes to the Second Amendment, gun control supporters argue that the
Second Amendment, “like any other freedom, is not absolute” and are of the opinion
3

Ella Nordberg
that the government may “institute reasonable firearms restrictions to maintain an
ordered society” – although this is often interpreted by the opposing side as a way to
ease into a complete banning of firearms (Utter & Spitzer, 2016:xvii).
2.2.

The Debate
Perhaps with the exception of abortion, gun control is the most controversial issue in
American politics, appealing strongly to the emotions of those who support, as well
as to those who oppose, further regulation of firearms.

(Utter & Spitzer, 2016:xv)
The United States is deeply divided on the issue of guns, and the matter of gun
control is frequently debated by politicians and citizens alike. According to Blanco,
the gun control debate can essentially be boiled down to one question, which is
“whether more guns make society more or less safe”. Gun control supporters believe
that the ready availability of guns is the main cause of gun violence, whereas those
opposed believe that guns keep people safe by enabling them to ward off potential
attackers (2016:620). Those opposed to stricter gun laws consider themselves
“supporters of a vital constitutional right to keep and bear arms”, whereas those in
favor see themselves as “struggling for a more civilized society against the ‘gun nuts’
and profit-hungry firearms manufacturers and dealers” (Utter & Spitzer, 2016:xv).
Essentially, the gun control issue, among other sociopolitical issues in America, boils
down to disagreements about whether individual rights or the common good should
take precedence (Blanco, 2016:624).
Both sides of the debate enforce their own message by casting a negative light on
that of the opposing side. Gun control advocates express concern for the attitudes
expressed by the opposing side (the “gun nuts”) regarding the ownership and use of
firearms, and the association of firearms with death and violence. Gun rights
supporters, on the other hand, highlight the “irrational fear of guns” expressed by the
control side (the “gun grabbers”), and the tendency to depict guns as inherently evil
in themselves, without regard for how they are used (Blanco, 2016:631). Blanco
highlights how the gun control debate is also a question about semantics in that the
way the disagreeing sides talk about each other nurtures their polarization:
The worldviews and interpretations assigned and the signification attached to each
other makes society’s polarization and dichotomization even more pronounced,
magnified, and exacerbated because the way interaction and discourse are done and
4

Ella Nordberg
the manner of treatment each side puts on the discussion table. The social labeling
and stereotyping allows people to cast judgments and aspersions which may be
baseless and unfounded but remains and endures because of the way they construe
and interpret the meaning of a gun without cultural bases.

(Blanco, 2016:632)
2.3.

Gun Control

According to James D. Wright, one of the main issues when talking about gun
control is that claiming to be for or against it is highly ambiguous. He clarifies this
by saying:
In the present-day American political context, “stricter gun control” can mean
anything from federal registration of firearms, to mandatory sentences for gun use in
crime, to outright bans on the manufacture, sale, or possession of certain types of
firearms. One can control the manufacturers of firearms, the wholesalers, the
retailers, or the purchasers: one can control the firearms themselves, the ammunition
they require, or the uses to which they are put. And one can likewise control their
purchase, their carrying, or their mere possession. “Gun control” thus covers a wide
range of specific interventions, and it would be useful indeed if the people who say
they favor or oppose gun control were explicit about what, exactly, they are for and
against.

(Wright, 1988:25-26)
Wright also states that gun laws are, in fact, not obsolete, but that they vary
enormously within the nation, and that sometimes, “regulations carried on the books
are not or cannot be enforced” (1988:26).
Different groups and classes of people have, in general, differing views about guns
and the meaning of guns (Blanco, 2016:629). Blanco states that these differences
should be taken into account by policymakers before trying to predict the people’s
reaction to gun control, because the reactions to stricter gun laws cannot truly be
realized before people’s backgrounds, values and attitudes are fully understood
(2016:629).
2.3.1. Supporters
The gun control advocates want to change things, whereas gun proponents are happy
with the way things are. This means that “the burden of proof” lies with the gun
control proponents, since they have to be able to prove that current conditions can be
improved upon. This means that the gun control side often cites statistics and studies,
whereas gun proponents typically just reference the Second Amendment in their
5

Ella Nordberg
arguments (Wright, 1988:37). According to Utter and Spitzer, gun control advocates
(or “the liberal elite”, Williams, 2003:170) are “at a definite disadvantage” in the gun
debate due to “the large membership in gun rights organizations and the many
popular publications dealing with firearms” (2016:xxi).
In his article, Rood discusses how “the warrant of the dead” is used when dealing
with the aftermath of public shootings. He defines the term as “an explicit or implicit
claim that the dead place a demand on the living” where the “living are called on to
act and the dead are invoked as justification for that action” (2018:47). This refers to
the way gun control proponents use victims of gun violence as reasons for why gun
control is necessary. Rood states that this argument is more often assumed than
argued outright by the gun control movement (2018:48). During his presidency,
Obama frequently used the warrant of the dead when arguing for stricter gun laws
(2018:49). However, the warrant of the dead is used in a restricted manner, since
most deaths involving a firearm do not make the news or result in political debate.
According to Rood, to use the warrant of the dead as an argument for stricter gun
control laws, some criteria need to be met – in general, shootings that happen in what
is thought to be a safe environment or that claim a great number or particularly
young victims garner more media attention than bar shootings in an unsafe
neighborhood (2018:52). The biggest problem that Rood identifies with this kind of
argument is “the problem of fleeting engagement”, where the public feels sympathy
for and mourns the victims for short periods of time before moving on with their
lives without pursuing societal changes.
Fleeting engagement is not caused simply by a failure of rhetoric or lack of effort.
Fleeting engagement is a cultural, economic, and technological problem; it is a
problem of limited time, energy, and attention in a world in which our media and our
newsfeeds prize speed and the next interesting thing (whether important or not).

(Rood, 2018:55)
The problem, it appears, is not the lack of support for gun control laws (such as
background checks, which, according to statistics is supported by the vast majority of
Americans) but the lack of activism from gun control supporters (2018:53).
2.3.2. Opposers
Those who support Americans’ right to bear arms frequently argue that guns are not
to blame for the violence that occurs in the nation – the saying “Guns don’t kill
6

Ella Nordberg
people, people kill people” is often heard as an argument against gun control.
Instead, gun proponents often argue that owning guns is “natural” and that American
citizens have a constitutional right to defend themselves against a potential attacker
with deadly force (2016:xvi). Henigan (2016) claims that the point of the “guns don’t
kill people” slogan is to point out that guns are “morally neutral” and “not dangerous
in and of themselves” – rather, they only become dangerous when they are being
used by dangerous people. The “gun problem” should therefore rather be understood
as a “people problem” (2016:15).
The warrant of the dead is also problematic in that the pro-gun side often denounces
it as “violating decorum and manipulating emotions” (Rood, 2018:62). According to
Rood (2018),
gun rights advocates often reject the notion that there is any obligation to the dead by
claiming that now is the time for mourning, not action; or that if there is an
obligation to the dead, it is not as important as the obligation to support the Second
Amendment; or that if an obligation to the dead is in fact most important, that
obligation is for greater access to guns to make sure that citizens can protect
themselves— that a “good guy” is not defenseless against a “bad guy.”

(Rood, 2018:55)
According to Williams, proponents of “the gun culture” are not simply people who
own guns, but rather people who place a special meaning to owning guns – people
who, in general, are “white rural males” from the South (2003:168).
Gun proponents often claim that outlawing guns would mean that only criminals
would end up possessing guns, a situation that most people would want to avoid at
all cost. For a criminal, “a firearm is an income-producing tool with a consequent
value that is several times its initial cost” – a robber, for example, can easily get his
money back after buying a firearm since it has enabled him to rob “more lucrative
targets” (Wright, 1988:30). Wright also claims that having guns available to someone
(e.g. police force) means that guns would most probably end up being available to
anyone – just at a certain price (1988:30). The corruption within groups of people
with access to guns cannot be excluded from the debate.
2.3.3. The National Rifle Association
On the NRA website, the NRA is presented as “a major political force” and
“America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights” (“A Brief History of
7

Ella Nordberg
the NRA”). The website encourages people to join the association due to the fact that
America’s gun rights are under threat and need to be protected. The executive
director of the NRA, Jason Ouimet, has published a number of articles on the website
that shine some light into the NRA point of view, two of which I mention here.
In “Why We Fight To Preserve, Safeguard Our Important Second Amendment”
(2019), Ouimet explains his point of view as an NRA member – he states that his
will to own a gun was established due to growing up in a bad neighborhood. He
states that the NRA protects the right of “law-abiding citizens” to carry firearms
when “they need them the most”. He thanks the NRA members for their continued
fight for their Second Amendment rights, and claims that there is “no question that
the forces aligned against you, me and our Second Amendment rights are more
organized and better-funded than anything we’ve faced before”. In “Armed Citizens
Save Lives” (2019), he claims that gun control supporters have “abandoned all logic”
in their support of gun laws that do not work. They will not work, he claims, because
criminals will not obey these laws – “which is why we call them criminals”. As an
example, he uses a home invasion where the homeowner was able to avoid getting
robbed and killed due to the presence of a firearm in the house that was used to kill
the assailant, and an attack on a civilian in Chicago, who was able to neutralize his
two assailants and save his own life because of his legally acquired firearm.
According to Ouimet, restrictions to gun ownership are therefore “potentially
deadly” for law-abiding citizens, which is why they are inherently flawed.
Based on these stories published on its website, the NRA prides itself in being the
supporter of the people who find themselves at a disadvantage in a physical
altercation, and this also includes women. However, Carlson (2014) states in her
article that the NRA’s thoughts on female safety are quite contradictory – on the one
hand, the organization promotes their guns to women, claiming that they prevent
women from becoming victimized, while at the same time, the NRA “has regularly
opposed laws that would make it more difficult for people who are suspected of
domestic violence to access firearms” (2014:60). The NRA’s opinion on gun control
is widely known to be negative, and the organization tends to claim that gun laws
simply do not work. Henigan identifies this argument as the “futility argument” –
gun laws do not work because criminals will not obey them, and since they will not
obey them, only law-abiding citizens will be affected by the laws in that they will be
8

Ella Nordberg
defenseless when they are facing an armed criminal (2016:42). The NRA has,
however, supported strict sentencing of those who have provably used firearms in
crimes (Wright, 1988:27).
Henigan, who is heavily critical of the NRA rhetoric concerning gun legislation in
Guns Don’t Kill People, People Kill People: and other myths about gun control,
believes that comparing guns to other potentially dangerous products, such as cars
(which the NRA has done on multiple occasions when opposing the introduction of
stricter gun control), is fallacious due to the fact that guns are manufactured, sold and
used as weapons, while cars are not (2016:23). He states that, while it is true that
guns do not kill people on their own, they do enable people to kill others in a much
more effective way than other weapons, such as knives and baseball bats (2016:28).
He also states that the NRA has resorted to the “slippery slope” argument (the
argument that gun control will eventually lead to the complete banning and
confiscation of firearms) due to the difficulty in opposing so-called common-sense
measures:
because it is so obviously difficult for the pro-gun forces to persuasively argue that
many reasonable and popular measures – such as waiting periods, background
checks, licensing and safety training, registration of gun sales, curbs on largevolume gun sales, and mandatory consumer-safety standards – are objectionable in
their own right, it becomes essential to argue that these measures will ultimately lead
to policies that have far less popular support and may be more difficult to justify.

(Henigan, 2016:82)
In this way, the NRA can switch the main point of the argument into being one about
values – which its supporters are more likely to feel defensive about (2016:84).

School Shootings in America

An issue that is often discussed when debating gun rights is the concern that students
will bring firearms to schools (2016:xxii), a concern which has proven valid due to
the substantial number of school shootings in the United States. However, gun rights
supporters have argued that firearms “in the hands of authorized persons” in schools
are likely to deter school shootings (2016:xxii). According to Utter & Spitzer, there
are two reasons for why students would take firearms with them to school: “selfprotection” and “impressing fellow students” (2016:269). It is typically after a
violent incident that measures are taken to prevent guns from entering school
9

Ella Nordberg
property, such as installing metal detectors or hiring security staff. At the start of the
21st century, measures such as these were becoming “common practice” in
American schools (2016:270).
According to Utter & Spitzer, the chances of a school student being injured during a
school shooting is “vanishingly small” when taken into account that there are
approximately 50 million school students in the United States – however, in the same
paragraph, it is mentioned that over the last twenty years, “shooting deaths account
for three-quarters of all violent school deaths” (2016:270).
According to Henigan, the mass shooting of young people in spaces that are
supposed to be safe – such as schools – are the ones that cause the most grief and
outrage in the general population. Therefore, he believes that gun advocates do their
best to minimize the significance of such shootings by comparing them to other ways
young children die senselessly, such as by drowning in swimming pools or in car
accidents (2016:34). It will be interesting to see whether this is the case in the
speeches given by Wayne LaPierre and Marco Rubio.
3.1.

The Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting

The Stoneman Douglas High School shooting took place on February 14, 2018. The
gunman, Nicolas Cruz, entered the school building in a premeditated attack on his
schoolmates and teachers. When he arrived at the school, he had a “backpack filled
with magazines and [he was] carrying a black duffel packed with his legally
purchased AR-15 semi-automatic rifle” (history.com Editors). Once inside the
building, Cruz started firing his weapon in a corridor, and managed to kill 11 people
in less than two minutes. The whole attack lasted just over four minutes. He
abandoned his weapon and managed to leave campus without being caught, although
he was arrested later the same day. Despite the school having organized school
shooter drills before the massacre and employing an armed officer on campus in
order to stop any potential shooter, the attack could not be prevented.
Three weeks after the shooting, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a bill imposing a
21-year age limit for the purchase of firearms. Additionally, the same bill allowed the
arming of some school employees in an attempt to stop future attacks (history.com
Editors). Cruz confessed to the killings, and is currently awaiting trial.

Following the shooting, surviving students started the Never Again movement,
whose intention was to prevent further mass shootings by fighting to implement
stricter gun laws. According to Livni, these students “made sure that the tragedy at
their school was impossible to ignore” (2019). The students’ advocacy even resulted
in stricter gun laws in Florida. The same students organized and partook in the March
for Our Lives demonstrations, where they gave speeches and showed their solidarity
with the gun control movement. However, on federal level, little progress has been
made (Livni, 2019).

Discourse Analysis

The concept of choice is what marks all discourse analysis – choosing to say one
thing instead of another to further one’s own point. Gee (2018), explains the
phenomenon as follows:
Choices have meaning not just by themselves, but also in relation to all the other
choices that were available, but excluded, once a choice was made. […] Choices can
allow us to try to capture the truth as we see it; to lie effectively; or to shape how
people think without directly lying to them. They allow us to express what we want
to say in ways that can reach people’s emotions and minds, and even encourage
them to act. We see here an important principle at work, the principle of choice. This
principle is at the heart of discourse analysis. This principle says that what
something means depends both on what we said and on the possible choices we had
to pick from in saying it. Both what we picked (the choice we made) and what we
didn’t (what we excluded) are meaningful and play a role in interpretation.

(Gee, 2018:4)
According to Gee, speakers themselves must signal to their audience the context in
which they are speaking by using “contextualization cues”. These clues indicate to
the audience what the context is, what statements are important, and helps the
audience understand the speaker’s viewpoint. These cues also tell the hearer “what
sort of person the speaker takes (or wants) the hearer to be for this communication,
what sort of person the speaker takes herself to be for this communication, and what
the speaker assumes of the world” (2018:106). According to Fairclough, “discourses
may represent the same area of the world from different perspectives of positions”
(2003:26). In Analysing Discourse, he states that:
Different discourses are different perspectives on the world, and they are associated
with the different relations people have to the world, which in turn depends on their
positions in the world, their social and personal identities, and the social
11

Ella Nordberg
relationships in which they stand to other people. Discourses not only represent the
world as it is (or rather is seen to be), they are also projective, imaginaries,
representing possible worlds which are different from the actual world, and tied in to
projects to change the world in particular directions. The relationships between
different discourses are one element of the relationships between different people –
they may complement one another, compete with one another, one can dominate
others, and so forth.

(Fairclough, 2003:124).
Further, Fairclough points out that each separate representation of the same issue is
not necessarily a separate discourse, but rather, that one single discourse may
generate several different representations (2003:124). The gun debate, for instance, is
one single discourse, but the opposing sides of it are two representations of it. In
these differing representations, guns may be presented as things that cause mass
shootings, things that prevent mass shootings (in the hands of possible security
personnel), or neutral agents that are used for mass shootings by deranged
individuals.
Fairclough states that, when different discourses (or their representations) come into
conflict, their vocabularies “may be partly different, but are likely to substantially
overlap” (2003:130). The same vocabulary may be used, but the words are frequently
used in different ways (2003:131). One way of discovering these ideological
differences is to identify words that frequently co-occur with the words in the shared
vocabulary – such as collocations, attributes and prepositions that are assigned to
these shared words. This is certainly true of the gun debate, where the same
vocabulary is often used on both sides when referring to weapons, victims of gun
violence and potential regulations, but where the ideological differences are
especially pronounced.
4.1.

Framing

Issue framing relates to how different evens, in their aftermath, come to be
understood (Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2001:521). How events such as mass shootings
are framed in discussions will directly impact how people relate to them and decide
how to handle them, and political debates contribute a great deal into this (2001:521).
Depending on which viewpoint dominates, policies get put in place that correspond
to these. In other words, frames decide what is considered important. However,

12

Ella Nordberg
Haider-Markel and Joslyn also state that the effects of framing “are not unlimited”
(2001:522).
In their article, Haider-Markel and Joslyn review two field studies conducted when
researching opinions on guns after a school shooting in Littleton, Colorado in 1999.
The first study examined “support for concealed handgun laws”, and was conducted
through phone interviews, whereas the other examined “blame attribution following
the shootings at Columbine High School” (2001:520).
In the first study, adults in Kansas were asked about their opinion on concealed
handgun laws. The issue was framed in two ways: either by emphasizing how
carrying a handgun has been considered an individual right or by stating that
handguns have been argued to threaten public safety, especially in schools
(2001:524). The frames can therefore be called the individual rights and the public
safety frames. Partisanship and political knowledge were also taken into
consideration when analyzing the results. It was found that the opinions of
Republicans and Independents were “most influenced by alternative frames”,
whereas the same effect could not be found with Democrats. Haider-Markel and
Joslyn speculate that the variation in the Republican answers stems from the
Republican emphasis on both individual freedom and public safety (2001:528).
People with considerable political knowledge were also more prone to “opinion
stability” (2001:529).
The second study was a telephone study conducted in Kansas where the interviewees
were asked why they thought the Columbine High shooting took place. The people
interviewed were divided into three groups: a control group, a “blame gun laws”
frame group, and a “blame violence in the media” group (2001:531). The results of
the study clearly show that frames affected the responses of the “blame gun laws”
and “blame violence in the media” groups when compared with the responses of the
control group (2001:532). Haider-Markel and Joslyn also state that Democrats are
the “most sensitive to the blame gun laws frame whereas Republicans and
Independents are not” and that Republicans are the “most influenced by the blame
media violence frame”, whereas Democrats are not (2001:535). All in all, HaiderMarkel and Joslyn concluded that “influence was possible if frames were accessible,

13

Ella Nordberg
political predispositions were consistent with the frame, and political knowledge was
low” (2001:536).
We find that alternative gun frames influence opinion about concealed handgun laws
as well as attributions of blame for Columbine. However, the effect is conditional,
hinging on the nature of respondents’ predisposition and existing knowledge.

(Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2001:520)
Obama’s speeches in response to mass shootings, especially those involving
children, have framed the issue of gun control as a parental responsibility –
according to Rood, Obama suggests that citizens have “an enduring obligation to act
as metaphoric parents” in order to protect the innocents in society (e.g.
schoolchildren) from becoming victims of a mass shooting (2018:60).
Seeing the dead only as statistics or as part of an abstract, mediated spectacle is not
enough. Instead, he asks listeners to recognize that the dead were real people and
that real families and friends and neighbors have been left behind. The dead will no
longer be able to celebrate “birthdays and anniversaries and graduations.” Moreover,
he asks us to imagine the dead as if they were part of our families and, more subtly,
to recognize that our own loved ones—whether we imagine our partner, child,
parent, grandparent, friend, neighbor, or someone else—could become a victim of
gun violence. Finally, he urges us to identify with all of the dead, even those
forgotten or ignored. Race and class should not matter. Proximity should not matter.
And questions about guilt and innocence are not the only ones that matter.

(Rood, 2018:61)
These findings are relevant when analyzing the speeches given by Emma Gonzalez,
David Hogg, Marco Rubio and Wayne LaPierre. Their different views on gun
control, and their desire to influence their listeners, means that they will frame the
issue in varying ways. For example, it would be reasonable to assume that when
David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez speak about guns, they will associate them with
negative things, such as increased violence, less safety and more unnecessary deaths.
Marco Rubio and Wayne LaPierre, on the other hand, will most likely want to bring
up the positive sides of gun ownership, such as increased possibilities for selfdefense.
4.2. Strategic Maneuvering
Strategic maneuvering plays a key role in the art of argumentation. According to van
Eemeren and Houtlosser, those who engage in argumentative discourse “are
characteristically oriented towards resolving a difference of opinion and may be
14

Ella Nordberg
regarded as committed to norms instrumental to achieving this purpose – maintaining
certain standards of reasonableness and expecting others to comply with the same
critical standards” while at the same time attempting to resolve the issue in a way
that is favorable to their own agenda (1999:480).
Topical potential, audience demand, and presentational devices are, according to van
Eemeren and Houtlosser, what create “rhetorical strategy” (1999:485). Using these in
order to reach an agreement is described by van Eemeren and Houtlosser as follows:
…strategic manoeuvring can take place in making an expedient choice from the options
constituting the topical potential associated with a particular discussion stage, in
selecting a responsive adaptation to audience demand, and in exploiting appropriate
presentational devices. Given a certain difference of opinion, speakers or writers may
choose the material they find easiest to handle; they may choose the perspective most
agreeable to the audience; and they can present their contribution in the most effective
wordings.

(1999:484)
Choosing the topical potential includes restricting the “disagreement space” in such a
way that is beneficial to the speaker, i.e. “in such a way that the confrontation is
defined in accordance with the speaker’s or writer’s preferences”. The opening stage
is about creating “the most advantageous starting point” by finding points that the
other party can (or must) agree with. During argumentation, a line of defense for the
speaker’s point of view is chosen from those available, and in the concluding stage,
the speaker attempts to reach their desired conclusion by, for example, pointing out
“the consequences of accepting a certain complex of arguments” (van Eemeren &
Houtlosser, 1999:484).
In order for argumentation to be successful, it also needs to be adapted to the
audience at hand. This is usually done by creating common ground and establishing
empathy, and may manifest itself “by avoidance of unnecessary or unsolvable
contradictions”. The speaker usually attempts to establish shared values, and use may
be made of experts that the audience agrees with or “referring to argumentative
principles that they adhere to” (van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 1999:485). One way to
establish common ground with the audience is to further one’s argument by using
concepts generally considered social goods, defined by Gee as follows:
A social good is anything some group of people take as valuable, good, wanted, or
necessary to have. Some social goods are society wide: nearly every human being
considers respect and freedom to be social goods.
15

Ella Nordberg
(2018:144)
What the speakers present as social goods may differ, depending on the point they
are trying to get across.
Zarefsky also identifies persuasive definitions, i.e. “those that convey an attitude in
the act of naming” (2007:399) as a part of strategic maneuvering. According to
Zarefsky, there are two ways to define a rhetorical situation – one is “a single
advocate addressing an audience” and the other is “two or more advocates in
competition for the adherence of an audience” (2007:402) – in other words, speeches
and debates. However, these two frames are often combined “in the midst of ongoing
controversies” (2007:402), such as the gun debate. Persuasive definitions are used by
speakers to convey and strengthen their own points of view. Another term for this is
“loaded language” – a way to use language itself to boost your own position, as
opposed to just logical arguments (2007:403):
a persuasive definition is a non-neutral characterization that conveys a positive or
negative attitude about something in the course of naming it. The name is, in effect,
an implicit argument that one should view the thing in a particular way. But the
argument is never actually advanced. Rather, the definition is put forward as if it was
uncontroversial and could be easily stipulated.

(Zarefsky, 2007:404)
In a controversy as emotionally loaded as the gun debate, it is reasonable to expect
that loaded language will also be used in the speeches analyzed in this thesis.

5. Methods and Materials
The materials for this study include four speeches, given by four different people.
The first two speeches are by Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, both students at
Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School, and both survivors of the shooting in
February 2018. Both of them spoke out on behalf of stricter gun control. The other
two speeches are by Senator Marco Rubio and Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice
President and CEO of the National Rifle Association, both of whom spoke against
further gun legislation. The lengths of the speeches range from two to six pages. In
my analysis, only the words used are of interest, so aspects such as body language,
facial expressions, and audience reactions, although relevant to the delivery, will not
be taken into account.
16

Ella Nordberg
Firstly, the analysis consists of discovering which words are used in combination
with certain key words that I have preselected, that frequently appear on both sides of
the gun control debate. Secondly, it consists of discovering the attitudes that hide
behind the specific word choices, and how they help further the speaker’s argument.
The preselected key words include the following:
5.1.

Any word for firearm: gun/firearm/weapon/arms

Due to the fact that guns are the very issue that is being debated here, words referring
to them simply had to be included in the analysis. The interest here lies in what
adjectives and other nouns guns are associated with in each speech, and what this
could mean for the effect of the delivery. Those in favor of gun control are more
likely to apply negative connotations to guns than those who oppose gun control.
Those in favor of gun ownership, on the other hand, are more likely to talk about
guns as tools for self-defense.
Cothran (2003) brings up differing opinions about guns in her book Gun Violence:
Opposing Viewpoints. The book contains a number of articles that bring up different
points of view in regard to gun violence and gun control. An article by the Violence
Policy Center describes how a “crisis” started when gun ownership in America
became more common in the following words:
The explosion in the country’s homicide and suicide rates has paralleled a
corresponding boom in its firearms population. Usually purchased for self-defense,
the easily concealable and portable handgun is used in the vast majority of gun
violence – even though it is outnumbered two to one by such traditional long guns as
sporting rifles and shotguns. The increased popularity of high-caliber, high-capacity
semiautomatic handguns – both standard and assault-weapon configurations – has
added to the carnage.

(The Violence Policy Center, 1998:18)
This point of view obviously supports the idea that the availability of guns would
play a significant part in the gun violence epidemic. The Violence Policy Center also
concludes that, in contrast to the position often touted by gun advocates, most
murders are committed by people who know each other and who often have a close
relationship (such as family members), rather than criminals (1998:19).

17

Ella Nordberg
However, Don B. Kates Jr.’s article offers a different take on the subject – he
believes that the rise in gun sales is not the reason for the increase in gun violence
during the 1960s:
The fact is that mere correlation between increases in gun buying and in homicide
does not and cannot prove guns cause murder. Assuming that there is any cause and
effect relationship, the most obvious one is the reverse, i.e., that it was the rise in
murders that caused increased gun buying. Alternatively, the upsurges in both
murders and gun sales may have been caused by a third factor, e.g., the enormous
increase in burglary and violent crime that also began in the 1960s.

(Kates, 2000:25)
Gun ownership should therefore be seen as a response to already occurring gun
violence, and not the other way around.
5.2.
Words relating to current gun legislation: The Second Amendment,
Constitution
Since gun owners frequently bring up their belief that their right to own firearms is
written in the Constitution, these words had to be included in the analysis. In his
article, LaCourse brings up arguments for why the Second Amendment protects the
right of private citizens to own firearms – the key here, according to LaCourse, is
how you choose to interpret the use of the term “the people” (which is mentioned in
the Second Amendment):
In order to find the true meaning of “the people”, one must simply read the first Ten
Amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as the Bill of Rights. The term
“the people” was used in the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
The First Amendment has never been interpreted as giving “the states” the right to
peaceably assemble. Nor has the Fourth Amendment been ruled as providing only
protection for state officials from unreasonable searches and seizures. Why should
the Second Amendment be treated differently?

(LaCourse, 2000:65)
Simmons claims that, from the middle of the 19th century, “a consistent line of
Supreme Court and federal appellate court decisions holds that the amendment does
not concern private citizens” (1997:69).
LaPierre and Rubio will most definitely incorporate the Second Amendment
argument into their speeches. I am interested to see whether Emma Gonzalez or
David Hogg will incorporate them into their message as well – and if so, how they do
it.
18

Ella Nordberg
5.3.
Words relating to potential gun legislation:
law/control/regulation/ban/legislation
These words are also a key element in the entire debate and can therefore not be
excluded.
Sobran claims that gun control is unconstitutional – he points out that the Second
Amendment “clearly forbids the federal government to ‘infringe’ that right [to keep
and bear arms]”. Additionally, since people have the intrinsic right to “life, liberty
and property”, then people also have the right to defend those rights – with deadly
force, if necessary (1999:75). The Second Amendment should be considered as
important as the First Amendment, since it “ensures that the federal government will
never get a monopoly of weaponry” in the same way that the First Amendment
protects the freedom of religion and press (1999:75.)
However, Blek Jr. sees the situation differently. He states that responsible gun laws
are essential, and that the belief that such laws would somehow violate the
constitution needs to be put to rest (1999:78). He claims that the NRA is misusing
the First Amendment right by spewing misinforming propaganda in order to allow
the continued widespread ownership of firearms. Blek Jr. points out that even the
First Amendment has restrictions to its use – and therefore, the Second Amendment
should, too:
The NRA uses our First Amendment right of freedom of speech to repeat their
misinformed rhetoric. In comparing First and Second Amendment rights, we all
recognize that freedom of speech, as broadly as it is interpreted, still has limitations.
For example, we are not allowed to yell “fire” in a crowded theater when none
exists. However, if we are to believe the NRA, the Second Amendment grants an
unconditional right to individuals to possess arms.

(Blek Jr., 1999:78-79)
Gonzalez, Hogg, Rubio and LaPierre will most likely have very different
connotations that they combine with each of these words.
5.4.

America(n), United States

Gun supporters often speak about guns as something inherently American. It can
hardly be denied that guns are quite a prominent element of American lifestyle. The
interest here lies in exactly how America is being defined by each speaker – how the
words are used and what connotations they are given by both sides of the debate.
19

Ella Nordberg
5.5.

freedom/right(s) and safe(ty)/protect(ion)

The debate inevitably hinges on which is more important, and how each of these
things is presented. Is safety something that is brought on by everyone having guns,
or by no one having them? Is the right to own guns brought up by the gun control
side, or the right to life by gun supporters?
In his article, Rosenblatt (1999) states that what ultimately will bring change to the
ongoing gun violence in the United States is not legislation in itself, but the people.
There comes a time in every civilization when people have had enough of a bad
thing, and the difference between this moment and previous spasms of reform is that
it springs from the grass roots and is not driven by politicians or legal institutions.
Gun-control sentiment is everywhere in the country these days – in the White House,
the presidential campaigns, the legislatures, the law courts and the gun industry
itself.

(Rosenblatt, 1999:50)
The fact that people are so tired of ongoing gun violence is what will spring them
into action and lead to firearms being banned.
Goldstein, on the other hand, recalls in his article an instance where he was almost
shot to death. As a result of this experience, he has become a firm believer in the
Second Amendment, and maintains that it is the right of every citizen to carry a
firearm for their protection if they so desire (2000:56). He believes that disarming the
people will “pave the way for major-league mass murderers, such as Adolf Hitler”
(2000:57).
5.6.

victims and perpetrator

I also explore how the speakers each refer to the victims of gun violence, be it as loss
of life, victim(s), death(s), and how they each refer to the perpetrator of gun violence,
Nicolas Cruz, be it as terrorist, shooter, kid, or any other variation. This will
hopefully show their attitude towards the tragedy and give an indication of where
they place the blame for the incident.

20

Ella Nordberg
5.7.

we/us and they/them

Additionally, I investigate how the speakers refers to themselves and the side of the
debate they represent, what they identify as their duties and what they consider to be
the failings of the opposing side.
Full transcripts of the speeches are provided in the Appendix.

Speeches

6.1.

Emma Gonzalez

Emma Gonzalez gave her speech at an anti-gun rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in
February 2018. In her speech, she accuses politicians of taking donations from the
NRA and not caring about the children whose lives are in danger as long as they get
paid. She speaks critically about the ease with which an automatic and semiautomatic
weapon may be purchased, and the inaction of the people in charge. The speech can
be described as aggressive, and the influence of her audience should be noted – at an
anti-gun rally, it is reasonable to assume that the audience will side with Gonzalez on
the gun control issue. This means that she is freer to speak her mind without
bothering about being diplomatic. Gonzalez’s speech is both a blame attribution to
the people in charge and a call for action.
6.1.1. gun/weapon/firearm/arms
Gonzalez mentions weapons 23 times in her speech. She uses the word gun 19 times,
weapon once and firearm once. Additionally, she mentions the word gunshot twice.
She also mentions the words rifle and shotgun once, respectively.
Gonzalez begins to present her stance on guns by stating that, since the Founding
Fathers, guns have “changed” drastically and have “developed at a rate that leaves
me dizzy”. This is to make the point that weapons are not what they used to be when
the Second Amendment – the law most frequently used by those supporting gun
rights – was written, and that laws should reflect this development. Due to this
development, guns can be used to do much more damage than the guns referred to in
the Second Amendment were able to inflict.

21

Ella Nordberg
Gonzalez also mentions how easy it is to obtain guns under the current legislation.
She claims she does not understand “why it should be harder to make plans with
friends on weekends than it is to buy an automatic or semi-automatic weapon”. Here,
she is comparing the act of buying a dangerous weapon with a normal occurrence in
a teenager’s life – making plans with friends. This highlights her youth and brings it
into strong contrast with the trauma she has been through because of these relaxed
gun laws. Next, she lists the amount of freedom the people of Florida enjoy when it
comes to purchasing a weapon:
…to buy a gun you do not need a permit, you do not need a gun license, and once
you buy it you do not need to register it. You do not need a permit to carry a
concealed rifle or shotgun. You can buy as many guns as you want at one time.

Pointing out all the things that are not needed to acquire a gun implies that these
things should be needed in order to obtain one. Gonzalez does not directly prescribe
specific attributes to guns in the way one would expect when someone is trying to
convince people to not buy or limit the purchase of a certain product. Perhaps she
feels that her audience knows enough about guns that she does not need to highlight
their deadliness. Instead, similarly to Rubio, she is speaking of guns as something to
be obtained, something used, something seen in gun shows. She is not vilifying guns
in themselves, at least not in an obvious way. She is merely pointing out the
recklessness of legislation that permits just about anyone to purchase one. However,
she also admits that guns cannot be described as “just tools like knives” or accused of
being “as dangerous as cars”, as those not sharing her viewpoint would claim.
According to Gonzalez, guns are dangerous, and should therefore be legislated more
effectively – but she does not suggest that guns are evil.
There are several points where Gonzalez calls “BS” on what gun supporters claim,
such as that “tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence”. This is a statement she
does not agree with, and it is obvious that gun laws are viewed by her as something
good, whereas gun violence (obviously) is not, and that gun laws can be used to
tackle the problem of gun violence in America.
6.1.2. Second Amendment, Constitution
Gonzalez only mentions the Second Amendment and the Constitution once in her
speech. She mentions how the amendment was added to the Constitution in “the time
22

Ella Nordberg
of the Founding Fathers”, which highlights its age and is perhaps meant to illustrate
how out of place it is in modern society. This is made especially clear considering
that Gonzalez continues by mentioning the alarming rate at which guns have
developed since the 18th century. The fact that the amendment is not mentioned
anywhere else in her speech suggests that she does not think it is worth considering
when discussing the matter of guns. Either she disagrees with the current
interpretation of the Second Amendment, or she does not think it has any intrinsic
value in the modern-day United States.
6.1.3. law/control/regulation/ban/legislation
The word law is mentioned a total of four times in Gonzalez speech, control once
and regulation twice.
Gonzalez first mentions laws in comparison with guns – “the guns have changed, and
the laws have not” – suggesting that the laws should have developed at the same rate.
Laws are therefore presented as critical in a society where gun ownership is so
widespread. Later in her speech, she states that “we are going to change the law”,
which again indicates that “change” is the thing to be sought after and what is
needed. At the end of her speech, she suggests that tougher gun laws are the key to
ending gun violence.
Gonzalez also mentions gun control once in her speech, when she compares the
United States to other developed countries in the world. She states that after Canada
and the UK experienced mass shootings, they introduced gun control. In comparison,
she says, the US has developed a website to track mass shootings in the country. In
conclusion, gun control works, if only the nation would choose to implement it into
its legislation.
Regulation is mentioned twice in her speech, in an allusion to an Obama era
regulation that would have limited the ability to sell firearms to people with
diagnosed mental illnesses. She mentions that the Trump administration repealed
said regulation, which she describes as “a really dumb idea”, no doubt concerned
about how this has made it possible for people with violent tendencies to acquire
firearms even with background checks being performed.

23

Ella Nordberg
6.1.4. America(n)/United States
Interestingly, America is only mentioned once in Gonzalez’s entire speech, when she
mentions “mass shootings in America”. This unflattering connotation highlights the
very essence of her speech – the United States is the only major western nation that
struggles with mass shootings. The situation has gotten so bad that the country is
actually known for the number of mass shootings that happen there every single year.
In a nation as patriotic as the United States is, this should be a cause for concern –
even among those who support gun ownership.
The United States is mentioned only once in her speech, as Gonzalez mentions “the
number of gunshot victims in the United States”. Again, the connotation is less than
flattering.
6.1.5. victims and perpetrator
Gonzalez mentions the word victim four times in her speech, and includes herself in
the definition (seen by her usage of the word we in the second paragraph). A victim,
by definition, is either subjected to something unpleasant or unpleasantly impacted
by something that is out of their control. The phrase “the number of gunshot victims”
is used twice in the speech, in an estimate as to how much money President Trump
received in donations from the NRA per gunshot victim lost to gun violence. Turning
the statistics of gun-related deaths into a math problem is a macabre illustration of
how gun control activists perceive the current situation – children’s lives are not as
important to politicians as money is. Gonzalez makes the point that, the more
shootings happen, and the more people die, the less each individual life’s monetary
worth is for politicians.
Gonzalez also uses the word students to refer to the victims of this particular mass
shooting. This highlights their position as young people who are at the mercy of their
elders when it comes to protection – students are, typically, minors, and most people
agree that children need to be protected by adults and other people in charge.
Gonzalez mentions how “the students at this school have been having debates on
guns for what feels like our entire lives”, which illustrates how they, apart from
being victims, are also taking part in a discourse about things that they in reality have

24

Ella Nordberg
no control over – even though their lives have been directly affected by the issue at
hand.
Just like Tinker v. Des Moines, we are going to change the law. That’s going to be
Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook and it’s all going to be due to the
tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and
most importantly, the students – the students who are dead, the students still in the
hospital, the students who are now suffering from PTSD, the students who had panic
attacks during the vigil because the helicopters who wouldn’t leave us alone,
hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.

Here, the word students is combined with words relating to the trauma and violence
they have suffered because of the shooting. It is very likely that Gonzalez is doing
this intentionally, in order to evoke emotions in her audience and inspire them to do
something to protect students and children in the future.
Gonzalez refers to Cruz as the shooter four times in her speech, and once as kid
(“you didn’t know this kid”). The fact that she does not use his name and simply
calls him a shooter strips him of any redeeming qualities and simply paints him as a
terrorist. However, Gonzalez’s mentions of him are kept rather short and she does
not go into any details as to what kind of person he was, or what his motivations may
have been – she simply states that learning he was the perpetrator of the act “was no
surprise to anyone who knew him”. Clearly, the signs of danger had been there for
some time, and yet Cruz was able to acquire firearms in order to perform a
premeditated mass murder.
6.1.6. freedom/right(s) and safe(ty)/protect(ion)
Gonzalez does not mention the word freedom in her speech. This is hardly surprising,
since she is actively advocating for more restrictions. This word is more often used
by those supporting gun ownership.
Rights are mentioned three times in her speech, all of them within the quote she has
chosen: She brings up a quote from a teacher, which is intended to sum up the
viewpoint of those opposing stricter gun laws: “When adults tell me I have the right
to own a gun, all I can hear is ‘my right to own a gun outweighs your student’s right
to live.’ All I can hear is mine, mine, mine, mine.” This is a statement that most
likely no one will admit to supporting, but this is how gun control activists view the
situation – unless something is done to limit the ability of people to freely purchase
25

Ella Nordberg
any weapon they want, this effectively means that the lives of the people who will be
lost because of this are put second to the individual’s rights to purchase said
weapons.
Gonzalez mentions the word safety once, in combination with the word gun. She
states that, since Australia introduced gun safety after a mass shooting in 1999, they
“haven’t had one since”. Australia has, in other words, done what the United States
ought to do, in her opinion. Gun safety made sure that there would be no further
massacres. The word protect(ion) is not mentioned in her speech at all. This is
somewhat surprising, since Gonzalez is addressing adults and placing blame on them
for not introducing proper gun laws – adults are the ones bearing responsibility over
the children in society, and in effect should protect children, such as Gonzalez
herself.
6.1.7. we/us & they/them
Gonzalez creates a connection with her audience when she refers to herself and them
as we throughout her speech – in the beginning, she states that “we are up here
standing together”. She obviously views the audience as standing on her side and
sharing her goals. She also uses the word we when referring to the United States and
the dire situation the nation is in:
Japan has never had a mass shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and
they both introduced gun control and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to
reporting these tragedies so that they can be formulated into statistics at your
convenience.

Gonzalez mentions different ways that we are going to change the system – “when
we have had our say with the government”, “we are going to be the last mass
shooting”, “we are going to change the law” – the word we is associated with change
that is desirable.
Gonzalez uses the word they when she wishes to distance herself from an idea or
claim. Her speech begins with her stating that they (meaning the politicians in the
House of Representatives) have not held a moment of silence for the victims lost in
the shooting. She seems to be suggesting that the politicians do not care about the
victims, which places a very strong divide between Gonzalez and the people in
charge, since she herself is one of the victims affected by the mass shooting. She also
26

Ella Nordberg
refers to the Founding Fathers as they – “since they added the Second Amendment to
the Constitution” – which makes it seem like she is distancing herself from them and
their principles, as well. Gonzalez speaks about how they (it is unspecified who she
is referring to) are claiming that mental illness is the reason for the shooting, which
she clearly does not agree with. She also blames those in the life of the shooter,
Nicolas Cruz:
…the people who let him buy the guns in the first place, those at the gun shows, the
people who encouraged him to buy accessories for his guns to make them fully
automatic, the people who didn’t take them away from him when they knew that he
expressed homicidal tendencies…

These people are, according to Gonzalez, not just the people who sell the firearms or
the politicians defending relaxed gun laws, but also “the people he [Cruz] lived with”
and “the people who saw him outside holding guns” – in essence, people who
witnessed troubled behavior and yet did nothing.
The motivations of the politicians opposing gun control are presented as purely
monetary – President Trump receiving thirty million dollars in donations from the
NRA, and the senators “who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the
NRA”. Gonzalez even calculates the monetary worth of each shooting victim to
President Trump:
Thirty million dollars! And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United
States in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800.
Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don’t do anything to
prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and
the number that they are worth will go down! And we will be worthless to you! To
every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you. If your
money was as threatened as us, would your first thought be, “How is this going to
reflect on my campaign? Which should I choose?” Or would you choose us, and if
you answered us, will you act like it for once?

The politicians taking donations from the NRA are portrayed as people looking to
make money off tragedies, as people who do not care about the consequences or the
loss of life as long as they are getting paid.
Gonzalez ends her speech by listing all the claims made by those opposing her
agenda – and even though these may represent different groups of people, they are all
lumped together and simply referred to as they: “they hush us into submission”,
“they say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence”, “they say a good guy
27

Ella Nordberg
with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun”, “they say guns are just tools like knives” and
“they say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless
tragedies”. She counters all these claims with “we call BS”, once again uniting
herself and her audience in a mutual cause. At the very end of her speech, she urges
her audience to “give them [local congresspeople] a piece of your mind”.
Gonzalez is very obviously critical of the politicians making the decisions that lead
to lax gun laws, but in her view, everyone who partakes and supports gun culture and
witnesses people misusing guns also shares the blame.
6.2.

David Hogg

David Hogg gave a speech at the March for Our Lives rally in March 2018. His
speech differs somewhat from the three others in that he does not directly mention
many of the keywords selected for my analysis, which frequently appear on both
sides of the debate. His speech mainly focuses on electrifying his audience and
inspiring them to be a part of the change he and his supporters wish to see in the
United States – to end unnecessary gun violence and to get rid of the politicians who
he claims have been bought by the gun lobby. He urges his audience to vote and to
be the heroes that the country needs.
6.2.1. gun/weapon/firearm/arms
Hogg only mentions the word gun four times in his speech and uses no synonyms.
His opinion on guns is made clear early on in his speech when he states that “96
people die every day from guns in our country”. Here, the middleman (the gunman)
is left out of the equation, and it is made to appear that guns are the root cause of
those deaths. Hogg is directly associating guns with death to further his point of the
danger they pose to Americans – and despite this, he claims that “most
representatives have no public stance on guns” (implying that this is an important
issue, and that they should have one).
The other times Hogg uses the word gun is when he talks about the gun lobby and
gun violence. The gun lobby is presented as the enemy in his speech, as it is
portrayed as an entity that stands against what he is trying to convey to the audience.
Hogg states that Americans should have the ability to “live without fear of gun
violence” – here, guns are associated with both fear and violence, and are vilified and
28

Ella Nordberg
clearly viewed as a problem to be solved, and not simply tools used by an
unbalanced person who wishes to cause damage.
6.2.2. Second Amendment, Constitution
Hogg makes no mention of either the Constitution or the Second Amendment in his
speech. This is quite unusual, considering how prominent these concepts usually are
in a discussion about firearms. However, since these concepts do nothing to support
his agenda, it is understandable that Hogg would leave them out.
6.2.3. law/control/regulation/ban/legislation
Hogg does not mention any of these words in his speech. His speech is more abstract
than this, even though his intentions are made perfectly clear – regulations, laws, and
control need to be implemented, but what is more important than the details is getting
people actively involved.
6.2.4. America(n)/United States
America is mentioned once in Hogg’s speech, American once and Americans four
times. It is obvious that the definition of what America means is important to Hogg
and the main theme of his speech. Hogg speaks about how the people running for
office need to run “not as politicians, but as Americans”, how people need to come
together “not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans”, and how they are
“Americans of the same flesh and blood”. To Hogg, the concept of American-ness is
in people working together for the greater good. Instead of focusing on what divides
them, Hogg’s message is that people should focus on what unites them, which is
being American. Hogg’s wish is that “every American can live without fear of gun
violence” – his speech is therefore sets a both unifying and hopeful tone for the
future. At the end of his speech, he utters the familiar patriotic phrase “God bless
America”.
Hogg’s frequent use of the word America makes his patriotism very evident.
However, it is patriotism of a different kind than what gun supporters are presenting
– Hogg is very clearly supportive of American ideals and values, but guns are left out
of the equation. While there are some that would accuse him of being disloyal to the
United States by not supporting gun ownership, the way he presents his viewpoint
29

Ella Nordberg
makes it very obvious that the concept of America is of great value to him – even if
he believes that things need to change.
6.2.5. victims and perpetrator
Hogg only directly mentions the victims of the Parkland High School shooting once
in his entire speech. At the beginning of his speech, he places a price tag in front of
his podium to illustrate “how much [Republican Senator] Marco Rubio took for
every student’s life in Florida” (one dollar and five cents, according to Hogg). The
lives lost are represented by this price tag.
Hogg also mentions the word children twice in his speech in reference to victims of
mass shootings in the United States, and identifies them as the future of the nation as
he speaks of the “continued slaughter of our children and our future” that politicians
are currently allowing. He states that Americans should care about “one thing and
one thing only, and that’s the future of this country and the children that are going to
lead it”.
The use of the word children is of course a tactical move that is supposed to
highlight the innocence and dependency of the young people on the adults as
decision-makers. It also enhances the reality that children are going through
traumatic events all over the country due to the inaction of those in charge – children,
who should be happy, go to school and grow up safely, are forced to go through
unimaginable traumas multiple times a year due to current legislation. Hogg is
blaming decision-makers for simply standing by and watching their futures get
slaughtered without doing anything about it.
Hogg does not mention Cruz in any way during his speech. This could be due to not
wanting to give Cruz any more media attention than he has already received, or
perhaps because he feels that the issue is much bigger than Cruz. Instead, his speech
is entirely focused on changing the status quo.
6.2.6. freedom/right(s) and safe(ty)/protect(ion)
Hogg mentions neither freedom nor rights in his speech, which is understandable
since he, just like Gonzalez, is advocating for more restrictions and less individual
freedoms. He does mention the words safe, safety and protective once, respectively,
30

Ella Nordberg
but not in the way that might be expected. He does not talk about how people should
be safe from being shot, but rather, how politicians have chosen to be “protective of
their position, the safety of inaction”. He suggests that politicians, rather than
keeping the public safe, have chosen to protect themselves, instead. They have
chosen not to do anything for fear of possible backlash at the expense of those who
die every year from being shot by a random perpetrator. This highlights their
incompetence and how unsuitable they are to hold office due to their complete
disregard of the public’s welfare. Hogg wants to change this, and states that “inaction
is no longer safe”, because the public will bring about change. Those who do not take
their responsibilities as politicians seriously enough to implement changes intended
to protect the public will, according to Hogg, be removed from office.
6.2.7. we/us and they/them
Hogg mentions the word we 14 times in his speech. Apart from creating solidarity
with his audience, it is most often used by Hogg as a call for action. Five times, he
uses the exact same phrasing – “we say: no more” – in response to a number of the
government’s wrongdoings that he mentions. The other nine times we is used to state
something that Hogg and his audience and those supporting him will make happen –
“we are going to make this the voting issue”, “we are going to take this to every
election”, “we are going to make sure the best people get into our elections”, “we
will come together”, “we will get rid of these public servants that only serve the gun
lobby, and we will save lives”, “we will not stop”, and so on. Hogg ends his speech
by stating that “we can, and we will, change the world”, which has brought his
message full circle from one of anger to one of hope and determination.
However, Hogg does see obstacles in his way. He states that there are people who
oppose his message and says that “they will try to separate us in demographics” to
weaken the chances for gun control. He does not clarify who he is referring to, but it
could be a number of groups – the gun lobby, politicians, gun owners, or anyone else
who does not agree with his message. However, his hope is not shaken, as he
responds to these statements by saying “they will fail”.

6.3.

Wayne LaPierre

The speech by Wayne LaPierre was given at the Conservative Political Action
Conference (CPAC) a week after the Stoneman Douglas shooting. The speech is
roughly 35 minutes long, easily the longest out of all four speeches selected for this
thesis. In the middle of the speech, LaPierre shows a video clip of himself speaking
about background checks. Since this video clip has nothing to do with the shooting of
interest in this thesis, LaPierre’s comments on the video and its contents have been
left out of the transcript.
Like Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, LaPierre is also facing an audience that he
can presume to be on his side. This means that he does not need to be careful in his
comments, and he can freely place blame away from himself and the NRA. He does
not need to convince anyone, so he does not waste time by weighing the pros and
cons of each side. In his mind, Democrats and liberals are in the wrong, and
Republicans and the NRA are not.
6.3.1. gun/weapon/firearm/arms
Unsurprisingly, LaPierre’s view on firearms varies drastically from those of David
Hogg and Emma Gonzalez. The first mention of guns comes in his speech when he
states how people are trying to eliminate “our firearms freedoms”. LaPierre does two
things here – he brings himself and the audience together in their mission to preserve
their right to own firearms with his use of the word our. He is stating that they are all
on the same side, and that all of them are affected by what the liberals are trying to
do. At the same time, he is combining the word firearm with the word freedom,
which is known as a very important and frequently brought up American value.
Essentially, he is making guns an important part of the lives of American people,
something that affects everyone in the audience.
LaPierre also mentions “gun-free zones”, and casts a rather negative light on them –
immediately following his mention of these zones, he adds that they are “wide open
targets” for anyone with bad intentions. Essentially, when guns are not around, an
area becomes vulnerable. He mentions that schools need to be protected with
“effective, trained, armed security” that will protect the most valuable thing of all,
the children. Therefore, guns should be associated with safety.
32

Ella Nordberg
Interestingly, LaPierre does combine the word weapon with destructive properties.
However, here, he is not referring to firearms when he talks about weapons – instead,
he is referring to “the art of the smear” that he feels the “socialists” are doing to the
NRA and gun owners in order to rob them of their liberties:
And socialism is a movement that loves a smear – racist, misogynist, sexist,
xenophobic, and more. These are the weapons and vitriol these character
assassinations scream to permanently hang on their targets and create a growing
segment of victims.

The smear campaign initiated by the socialists is connected with nouns that
otherwise would be associated with firearms – assassinations, targets, and victims.
LaPierre is taking the negative connotations of firearms and projecting them onto
something else. It is a remarkable shift of blame, and very likely intentional.
LaPierre does, however, make some concessions. He does admit that guns should be
kept out of the hands of those who pose a danger to society:
No one on the prohibited persons list should ever have access to a firearm. No killer,
no felon, no drug dealer. And anyone that is adjudicated is mentally incompetent or
danger to society should be added to the check system and prevented from getting
their hands on a gun.

However, it is unclear whether the NRA has actually done anything recently to
implement these restrictions – LaPierre also talks about the citizens’ right to privacy,
and goes on to mention how “your conversations with your doctor” should be kept
out of government databases. This begs the question as to how people with mental
health diagnoses could be prevented from purchasing firearms.
LaPierre urges his audience to remember that he is not advocating armed resistance
when it comes to people protecting their firearms. Instead, he points out that this
movement should be “a resistance armed with the United States Constitution and the
Bill of Rights in our country”. He ends his speech with a known quotation,
frequently used by supporters of the Second Amendment: “to stop a bad guy with a
gun, it takes a good guy with a gun”. The gun is therefore never the problem in itself
– it all depends on the person who wields it.

33

Ella Nordberg
6.3.2. Second Amendment, Constitution
The Second Amendment is mentioned a total of 12 times in LaPierre’s speech,
whereas the Constitution is mentioned five times (constitutional once). In his speech,
LaPierre is presenting the Second Amendment as something that is being threatened
by the gun control movement (and the politicians supporting it) that should be
protected at all costs. He claims that they – identified as “Chris Murphy, Nancy
Pelosi, and more” – “hate the Second Amendment” and want to eliminate it along
with “our firearms freedoms”. Whereas the gun control movement, according to
LaPierre, “hates” the Second Amendment and the individual freedoms associated
with it, he himself, and the people who support him, “revere their Second
Amendment freedom to protect themselves”.
LaPierre asks the audience to imagine a scenario where “an elderly couple that,
because they sought help to do their taxes, that they could no longer exercise their
fundamental Second Amendment right” (a misrepresentation of the Obama
administration’s proposal to ban the purchase of firearms for people who had given
authority of their financial assets to someone else). The Second Amendment is
presented as a fundamental right of the American people, something which cannot
simply be taken away on a whim. He claims that the “socialists” are trying to deny
people their “Second Amendment rights”. By definition, denying someone their
rights is illegal, so what the liberals are essentially trying to do is, according to
LaPierre, criminal. He claims that “socialists” dislike the Second Amendment in the
same way that they dislike free speech – and that they revel in stripping people of
their individual liberties:
They like only limited speech, controlled speech, controlled by them, through safe
speech zones, where they can shame the outspoken, or riot to shut them up. If you
still think we have full First Amendment freedom in this country, try going right
now out to Berkeley and speaking out in favor of conservative causes or even the
Second Amendment.

LaPierre claims that, if the “socialists” gain power in the United States, Americans
will end up losing a great deal of their individual freedoms, and that the Second
Amendment and the Constitution “will be the first to go”. Essentially, gun control
activists – or socialists, as LaPierre describes them – are a threat to American values
in general, and the Constitution is a representation of those values, which should be
34

Ella Nordberg
protected. The Second Amendment is now being “despised” in American schools
due to propaganda from the gun control movement and must also be protected.
At the end of his speech, LaPierre calls the audience to “stand and unflinchingly
defend the Second Amendment, the one freedom that protects us all in this country”.
This sentence seems to sum up the intention of his whole speech – instead of
mentioning the children that were killed because the purchase of firearms lacks a
proper screening, LaPierre wants the audience to protect the law that allows this
practice to continue. Instead of focusing on how such tragedies could be prevented in
the future, he focuses his speech on convincing his audience that it is the right to
possess firearms that is under threat, and to portray this as the main issue, and the
attempt to impose more restrictions as unnecessary government control of lawabiding citizens.
The Constitution is given the same treatment in LaPierre speech – it is presented as
something fundamentally American, something that is being threatened by
“saboteurs” who “don’t believe” in the Constitution, and therefore, don’t believe in
“America as we know it”. LaPierre claims that the Constitution is the sole thing
preventing “the privileged and the powerful” from taking charge completely. In the
same way that the Second Amendment is “despised” in schools, the Constitution is
being “ignored”. Out of the six times that the Constitution is mentioned, four times
LaPierre calls it “the United States Constitution”, which is evidently intended to
highlight the Constitution’s importance in American society. The United States is the
Constitution, and through the Constitution being under threat, the United States is
also under threat.
6.3.3. law/control/regulation/ban/legislation
The word law(s) is mentioned 19 times in LaPierre’s speech, control(led) 9 times,
and banned twice. Most of the time, these concepts are given negative connotations.
LaPierre identifies the “calls for more gun control laws” as shameless exploitation of
tragedy performed by the gun control movement. Aside from the Second
Amendment and the Constitution being under threat, also the law-abiding are being
threatened by sanctions that they have not deserved. In essence, LaPierre is claiming
that those suffering from further gun control laws are not criminals, but rather
35

Ella Nordberg
responsible gun owners who have done nothing wrong. Therefore, the victims of
these laws are going to be gun owners in general, and not criminals.
Next, LaPierre goes into why he thinks laws are not the solution to the problem. He
claims that gun control activists “fantasize” about imposing more laws, even though
laws in general are ineffective. He talks about how laws have “failed to stop”
problems in society, and how laws only succeed “when people obey them” – in
essence, you cannot expect a criminal to respect any new laws that Democrats can
come up with, because if criminals cared about the laws, they would not be
criminals. Laws are, according to LaPierre, being “ignored” on a regular basis, they
“don’t stop” gang violence or illegal immigrants from crossing the border, and they
“haven’t stopped the plague of opioids”. In essence: laws do not work, and should
not be considered the solution to the gun problem in the United States. At the same
time, LaPierre identifies the NRA to be “one of the largest law enforcement
organizations in the United States”. It is unclear what is meant by this, although it
could have something to do with the sale of firearms to law enforcement.
LaPierre considers the movement for more gun control to be a ploy by the socialists,
the Democrats, and the government to exercise more control over law-abiding
Americans. They want “even more government control”, “care more about control”,
they want to “get more control over people” – their agenda is presented as nothing
more than a ploy to be in charge of Americans and strip them of their freedoms.
“Absolute control” is supposedly “their ultimate dream” – control of the people, their
guns, social media, everything.
They like only limited speech, controlled speech, controlled by them, through safe
speech zones, where they can shame the outspoken, or riot to shut them up.

Control is essentially a dirty word for LaPierre, who believes that Americans do not
need (or want) that type of government interference in their lives. It is to be seen as
the very opposite of freedom, which is what LaPierre himself appears to cherish
more than anything else.
In his speech, LaPierre also describes a dystopian society, one which, according to
him, could be brought on by “political disease” rising to power. In this dystopian
world, people are repressed, their rights are “destroyed”, and their firearms “banned
and confiscated”. The right to own guns is presented as something essential to a free
36

Ella Nordberg
society, and only a society of repression would even consider taking its citizens’
firearms away. To him, the issue is not about the safety of the masses, it is a ploy by
the government to try to keep control of the masses.
6.3.4. America(n)/United States
America(n) is mentioned 23 times in LaPierre’s speech, whereas the United States is
mentioned 8 times.
LaPierre begins his speech by saying how another tragedy has taken place in an
“American school”. While Americans were searching for solutions, those opposing
LaPierre’s message – “Chris Murphy, Nancy Pelosi, and more, cheered on by the
national media” – are unreasonably blaming the NRA for what has happened. But in
reality, LaPierre states, these people “don’t care, not one wit about America’s school
system”. The “American mental health system” has failed, and now laws
implemented have been able to keep crime out of “every major American
community” or “American streets”. This gives the impression that the actions of the
Democrats, in their pursuance for stricter gun laws, are anti-American. In turn,
LaPierre states that “we at the NRA” are “Americans who continue to mourn and
care and work every day at contribution real solutions”.
LaPierre states that he has “had the pleasure of working with a number of Democrats
who believe America to be the greatest country in the world” (suggesting that he
thinks this, too), but that the party has changed during the Obama era. He claims that
the current Democratic Party is a party that does not “believe in America as we know
it”. The party is trying to change the very essence of what the country is all about.
LaPierre describes “individual liberty” as the “American ideal”. He claims that this
liberty is being infringed upon by the government demanding too much information
from the people:
This growing socialist state dreams of manipulating schoolchildren, to squeeze and
squeeze information about their parents. They'll be asking your kids if mommy and
daddy spank them, or what mommy and daddy feeds them for dinner, they'll want to
know what TV shows you watch, what magazines, newspapers you read, and, oh,
yes, do mommy and daddy own a gun? And all that private information will be
entered into that ultimate list that cloud of data storage that couldn't care less about
due process and constitutional freedom and your privacy as an American citizen.

37

Ella Nordberg
The government is trying to strip people of their rights as American citizens by
taking away their guns and taking away their privacy, and all this is, according to
LaPierre, “the real consequence of this new socialist wave in America” – and as a
result, “American freedoms” will be lost.
LaPierre talks about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as documents of genius
that are responsible for “the brilliance of America”. He even goes as far as claiming
that the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense is “not bestowed by man but
granted by God to all Americans as our American birthright” – however, it is unclear
why God would choose to bestow that right only on Americans. LaPierre is not only
turning to the Constitution to defend his beliefs about guns, but now he is also
appealing to religion.
According to LaPierre, the United States Constitution makes it clear that the
privileged and powerful are not in charge, but rather, the people are. The ability to be
in charge is presented as being made possible by the right to own guns. LaPierre
believes that the United States has come under threat from the liberals, who have
caused a situation where “United States Constitution is ignored”, and “United States
history is perverted”. The words United States are mostly used in combination with
the word Constitution, which makes it seem like those two things are roughly the
same thing, in LaPierre’s mind.
6.3.5. victims and perpetrator
LaPierre refers to the victims of the attack as the innocent once, schoolchildren once,
our children four times, our kids three times, and innocent child once. By doing this,
he is showing that he is not indifferent to the suffering of the families, and that he is
aware that children need to be protected. By calling the victims children, he is
assigning them attributes that make people want to take action to protect them – and
by calling them our children, he is creating solidarity with the audience proving to
them that he, personally, is in this, too. However, LaPierre’s idea of protecting
schoolchildren differs drastically from the ideas of the gun control movement –
instead of limiting the sale of firearms, he claims that firearms bring safety – if they
did not do this, he claims, they would not be used in the White House, Capitol Hill
and Hollywood. He states that “our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL

38

Ella Nordberg
games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians” are all protected more
thoroughly than the children at school – through guns.
In reference to the shooter, LaPierre remains quite vague. He never refers to Cruz by
his name, as a “shooter”, “terrorist”, “kid”, or any other usual name. Instead, he
states that “evil walks among us” – turning school shootings into something abstract
and the enemy into something that is hard to defeat. By dehumanizing the threat to
safety, LaPierre is creating an image in the audience’s mind that will most likely
have them reaching for their firearms in a bid to protect themselves and their loved
ones. As he speaks more generally about school shootings, he mentions that schools
are “wide open targets for any crazy mad man bent on evil” – suggesting that, when
that happens, the only proper thing to do is to have another armed person there to
eliminate the shooter. Evil and madness are both forces that are difficult to reign in
by creating new laws, which I suspect is precisely the message LaPierre wants to
convey.
6.3.6. freedom/right(s) and safe(ty)/protect(ion)
LaPierre mentions freedom(s) 21 times, right(s) 9 times, safe(ty) 8 times and
protect(ion) 13 times. LaPierre claims that his opposers “hate individual freedom”,
that their goal is to “eliminate” firearms freedoms and “eradicate all individual
freedoms”. At the same time, the Second Amendment freedoms are “revered” by
those who support him. He refers to the freedom Americans have as fundamental
freedoms, basic freedoms, individual freedoms, essential freedoms and our freedom.
Freedom is obviously a key word in his message, which is in line with earlier
argumentations for keeping the Second Amendment unchanged in the Constitution.
He often combines the word freedom with an adjective or attribute that indicates that
it is worth defending – examples being basic and fundamental, which indicate that
freedom is something that people naturally are entitled to, our and individual to
indicate that it is something everyone shares. He also talks about Second Amendment
freedoms, First Amendment freedoms, constitutional freedom and American
freedoms, connecting the concept of freedom very firmly with American values and
as a fundamental part of American lifestyle. Freedom is what sets America apart,
freedom equals life itself, since there is “no greater personal individual freedom than
the right to keep and bear arms, the right to protect yourself, and the right to
39

Ella Nordberg
survive”. The Second Amendment is identified as “the one freedom that protects us
all in this country”. LaPierre states that the NRA not only protects the Second
Amendment, but all of our freedoms – because protecting all of the citizens’
freedoms is what leads to having real freedoms.
LaPierre often talks about Second Amendment rights as something that cannot be
denied American citizens, as they in his mind are connected with “the right to protect
yourself” and “the right to survive” – he even claims that “the right to keep and bear
arms” is an “American birthright”. To him, the threat to take guns away from
American citizens is literally a matter of life and death.
LaPierre claims that he, his audience and even his opposers “share a goal of safe
schools, safe neighborhoods, and a safe country” – however, opinions about the
methods with which these goals are to be attained are vary drastically between the
parties. LaPierre also claims that, for his opposers, the gun issue has nothing to do
with schoolchildren – “for them, it is not a safety issue, it is a political issue”. This
should be interpreted to mean that LaPierre himself is only concerned about safety –
which, in his mind, can only be brought about through the presence of guns.
Claiming that armed security makes people less safe is, according to him,
“completely ridiculous”, and armed security is what keeps the rich, famous and
powerful safe. The same courtesy should therefore be afforded to children in schools.
In contrast, “safe speech zones”, that socialists support, are simply a platform where
free thinkers are shamed into silence.
LaPierre believes that the duty of the adults is to protect schoolchildren and
themselves from danger. This duty is fulfilled by being armed and prepared in the
face of danger. He claims it is “bizarre” that “our banks, our airports, our NBA
games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians, they're
all more protected than our children at school”. Also “the innocent law-abiding
people of this country” need to be protected “from being falsely accused, politically
abused and permanently stigmatized unjustly” simply for owning a firearm, as such
protection is currently not in place. LaPierre also states that “real freedom requires
protection”. His view of being protected is equal to having the right to carry a
firearm or be protected by someone else who carries one.

40

Ella Nordberg
6.3.7. we/us and they/them
LaPierre starts his speech by stating that “we have serious discussions ahead and
serious issues that impact each and every one of us”, and how a week earlier “we
were all horrified” by the shooting in the Parkland high school. This we likely
includes himself, his audience, and every other American. However, his tone quickly
shifts, and he starts to distance himself and the audience from anyone that does not
share their view:
Think about that, in the midst of genuine grief, and a very understandable passion, as
millions of Americans searched for meaningful solutions, what do we find? Chris
Murphy, Nancy Pelosi, and more, cheered on by the national media, eager to blame
the NRA and call for even more government control.

Suddenly, there has been a shift in whom we is referring to. The next time LaPierre
uses the word, he is referring to the NRA – “we at the NRA are Americans who
continue to mourn and care and work every day at contributing real solutions to this
very real problem” – and no longer to the general population of the United States.
Do we really love our money and our celebrities more than we love our children?
Can we answer that question honestly? Any of us. Can we answer that question
honestly? Knowing that we surround and protect so much with armed security while
we drop our kids off at school that are so-called gun free zones, that are wide open
targets for any crazy mad man bent on evil to come there first?

Here, we is referring to LaPierre himself and those in his audience who support gun
ownership. LaPierre is appealing to the audience members’ parental protectiveness
and hopes to make them see that they are currently not doing everything they could
be doing to keep their children safe from harm. Later on, we refers to the NRA again,
when LaPierre proclaims that “we will provide immediate assistance and we will
also provide it absolutely free to any school in America”. By doing this, he is
presenting the NRA as the solution to the problem, since the “socialists” do not
“believe in America as we know it” – we being the people present.
At the end of the speech, we has reverted back to meaning the NRA – we will speak
out “louder” and “stronger” for the preservation of individual freedoms, and LaPierre
is careful about making it clear that we “are never talking about an armed resistance
against the socialist corruption of our government”. In the last sentence, LaPierre
brings the audience into the definition by stating that we “must immediately harden
our schools”. This is so that the audience realizes that, when something needs to be
41

Ella Nordberg
done, their contribution will be essential. We are the people in the right, whereas
anyone not supporting LaPierre’s views is referred to as they.
LaPierre creates a very clear divide between his side of the argument and those
opposed to it. He makes so many radical claims about those against him that it starts
to sound like a conspiracy theory:
They hate the NRA. They hate the Second Amendment. They hate individual
freedom. In the rush of calls for more government, they also revealed their true
selves. The elites don't care, not one wit about America's school system. And
schoolchildren – if they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them.
For them, it is not a safety issue. It is a political issue. They care more about control
and more of it. Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment and our firearms
freedoms, so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.

He claims that these people “don’t care if their laws work or not”, because
ultimately, all they are after is more control. In contrast, “the NRA does care”.
Absolute control in every corner of our government is their ultimate dream. These
intellectual leads, they think they're smarter than we are. They think they're smarter
than the rest of us. And they think they're better than we are. They truly believe it,
and you know it.

LaPierre is making it clear to the audience that people supporting gun control believe
that gun supporters are stupid. Not only that, he is also telling the audience that they
already know this, too – the “intellectual leads” may think that NRA supporters are
stupid, but the NRA knows that their audience is clever enough to see it. He is
intentionally creating a divide between his listeners and his opposers, no doubt
hoping this will work to his advantage. Gun control activists are not the only ones
that are being painted in an unflattering light, either – according to LaPierre, “those
who have risen to power in this so-called national news media and seized control of
social media to spread their propaganda” are also lying to the American people:
They don’t tell us news, and you all know it, and people know it all over the United
States, they say it to me every day. They don’t tell us news – they tell us what we
need to think. That’s the way it is these days.

These are the same people that LaPierre has referred to as both “political disease”
and “the privileged and the powerful”. “The privileged and the powerful” are
“political disease” that is the enemy of gun owners – excluding himself out of this
group suggests that LaPierre is placing himself in the same group with his audience,

42

Ella Nordberg
and thereby the common man. Since he should be seen as belonging to this group, it
should be easier to believe that he also has their interest at heart.
Meanwhile, they (“you name the group”) are fighting the NRA by turning themselves
into victims and “finding something to be offended by every minute of every day”.
LaPierre also claims that they are responsible for the mass shootings taking place in
the United States through the cracks in the system, “the very cracks that they have
enabled in the system”. He claims that Charles Schumer, United States Senator,
“shook my hand to get all the mental health records into the system” and “did
absolutely nothing”. LaPierre states that they (presumably the “elites”, as he
describes them) “are liars to the core”. Essentially, the NRA is unfairly being
assigned blame for the mass shootings, even when the organization is only trying to
prevent them.
6.4.

Marco Rubio

Marco Rubio spoke about gun laws on the Senate floor one day after the Parkland
shooting. His speech is roughly ten minutes long, and touches upon issues such as
the ineffectiveness of gun laws and the determination of shooters to acquire their
preferred firearms. Rubio also repeatedly states that these issues should not be
interpreted to mean that there is nothing to be done to prevent future attacks.
Similarly to LaPierre, Rubio is also against the banning of firearms, but his reasons
are somewhat different. He claims not to be against the limiting gun purchases “per
se”, but instead claims that laws simply will not solve the problem. He also does not
present the issue as Democrats versus Republicans. Rather, he suggests that there are
better solutions to the problem, however, he fails to mention any concrete actions
that the government could or should take in the future.
The fact that this speech took place in the Senate means that Rubio will have faced
an audience with differing opinions. Some may have agreed with his statements, and
others may not. His delivery of the speech is more careful than that of the three
others, because he cannot assume to be supported. This is why he must be careful
when constructing his arguments, and he also needs to provide explanations for why
his view about the ineffectiveness of gun laws is right and the opposite view is
wrong. The transcript of this speech has been written by me.
43

Ella Nordberg
6.4.1. gun/weapon/firearm/arms
Rubio mentions weapons 16 times in his speech – he uses the word gun ten times,
weapon four times, weaponry once and arms once. These words are often the objects
of a sentence, preceded by a verb such as get, acquire, sneak, use, and buy. The guns
and weapons are subjected to an action, which indicates that guns are neutral tools in
the matter with no agency. This indicates that the person that acts, i.e. uses the gun, is
the one who is to blame for gun violence, not guns in themselves. Therefore, the
efforts made by the gun control community to implement laws that would restrict the
availability of firearms are misplaced – changing the law will not matter, since guns
are not the issue. Three times he refers to creating laws about who gets access to
firearms as “making it hard” to get guns – “hard”, not impossible – which shows his
lack of faith in the agenda.
It is notable that Rubio speaks of guns in this passive sense throughout his speech,
which highlights his stance that guns themselves do not directly cause gun violence.
He also rarely uses adjectives to describe guns – rather, he refers to semiautomatic
weapons as “those things”, “a certain kind”, “those kinds”, “this type” of guns, which
is quite neutral. He seems to avoid connecting any adjectives or attributes to weapons
themselves in a way that might be expected of someone arguing for the continued
right to gun ownership. I believe this is because attributes that make a weapon good
(effectiveness, speed, easy handling) do not create compelling arguments for why
they should still be available to people. However, Rubio does mention that he
supports “the right to bear arms” for protection, allowing the interpretation that,
according to him, owning guns equals safety.
Notably, and quite understandably, Rubio also never explicitly refers to
“semiautomatic” weapons, even though this is what was used in the Parkland
shooting (and also what is meant by “this kind” and “those kinds” of guns) – possibly
to downplay their capacity to cause significant damage. Only once in Rubio’s speech
do the words gun and violence occur together – however, immediately after, Rubio
states that “we also have to focus on the violence part”. This makes it very clear that
he wishes to separate the concept of guns and the concept of violence from one
another, which would seem like a vain effort, considering that the very purpose of
guns is to cause damage.
44

Ella Nordberg
6.4.2. Second Amendment, Constitution
Rubio states that, as he took office, he swore to “uphold the Constitution of the
United States”. His purpose as a Senator is to obey and uphold the Constitution, and
in effect, the Second Amendment – he “agrees with it” and he “supports it”, despite
not having written it himself. He adds that the Second Amendment “is in the
Constitution” – which in itself is not much of an argument, but the point here is to
make it clear that the Constitution is something that ought to be supported for the
intrinsic importance it carries for American society. He highlights the importance of
the Second Amendment by stating it is “so important”, that it is the second
amendment in the Constitution, “right after free speech”. This suggests that the right
to own guns would be almost if not equally as important as free speech, one of the
core values in most western societies. He mentions the ranking of the Second
Amendment twice during his speech. (However, it should be noted that Rubio also
admits to the importance of the Constitution’s preamble, which highlights the
government’s obligation to protect its citizens from both foreign and domestic
threats.)
6.4.3. law/control/regulation/ban/legislation
Laws are mentioned a total of ten times in Rubio’s speech. During his speech, Rubio
makes it very clear how little faith he has in “these laws that have been proposed”
and “those laws”. He claims that the laws “wouldn’t have prevented them [the
attacks]”, and that anyone who has decided to commit mass murder will “figure out a
way to evade those laws, or, quite frankly, to comply with them in order to get
around it”. So laws are not only ineffective in that criminals have no respect for
them, but also allow criminal misuse of the system through compliance with the
laws.
Rubio keeps repeating how laws “could” be passed, but immediately follows these
statements up with a reason for why that would be useless. For instance, he states
that “you could pass a law that makes it hard to get this kind of gun in a new
condition”, but that this would not matter, “because there's so many of them out there
already”. However, he also states that this “doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a law
that makes it harder [to get guns]” – and immediately counters this by saying that “it
isn’t going to stop this from happening”. Instances where he mentions laws are full
45

Ella Nordberg
of negations or mentions about how laws are difficult to implement, as illustrated in
the example below (negations in bold):
And I would add, though, that if we do something, it should be something that
works. And the struggle up to this point has been that most of the proposals that have
been offered would not have prevented, not just yesterday’s tragedy, but any of
those in recent history. And I'm gonna say now what I'm gonna really emphasize at
the end – just because these proposals would not have prevented these, does not
mean that we therefore just raise our hands and say therefore, there's nothing that
we can do. It is a tough issue, because it is part of the reason why it is so hard to
prevent these, is because if someone decides that they're gonna take it upon
themselves to kill people – whether it’s a political assassination of one person or the
mass killing of many – if one person decides to do it and they're committed to that
task, it is a very difficult thing to stop. But that again does not mean that we
should not try to prevent as many of them as we can.

The negative statements make it clear that Rubio does not have any faith in the gun
control agenda, and this tone continues throughout the entire speech. At the end of
the speech, Rubio suggests that there is something that could be done “without laws”
to better the situation – however, he never mentions what this action could be.
6.4.4. America(n)/United States
The word America is used only once in Rubio’s speech, as is the word Americans.
He states that the “Second Amendment gives Americans the right to bear arms and to
protect themselves” and that “somewhere in America right now, some equally
troubled and deranged, violent individual is reading and watching coverage of this
attack and gaining from it, not sorrow, but inspiration”. First, he mentions the
fundamental American right to self-defense. Immediately after this, he creates a
picture of a threat that makes this type of self-defense necessary, namely an unstable
individual in America (not in some foreign country or anywhere else in the world)
who has made the decision that he wants to commit a crime similar to the mass
shooting that is being discussed. Even here, the United States is (perhaps
unintentionally) being associated with frequently occurring mass shootings, which
makes it necessary for people to defend themselves and their families, and therefore
own guns.
The United States is mentioned only once in Rubio’s speech, as he is talking about
“the Constitution of the United States”, and how “every element of it” needs to be
upheld.
46

Ella Nordberg
6.4.5. victims and perpetrator
Rubio refers to the victims of the shooting as children. Like the other speakers, he
wishes to highlight the vulnerable position of the shooting victims, which are
dependent on the protection of their elders. Rubio even highlights his own position as
a father in order to create common ground with his listeners and make the point that
he understands the concerns of the parents in the audience:
And I can only imagine how fearful it would be, when suddenly, those texts are not
being answered, and those calls are not being returned. I thought about that last
night, and what it must feel like to be one of those parents at the hotel, waiting for
word, if you hadn’t heard from your children in hours. Or how painful it must’ve
been to those, whose job it was to go to these parents and inform them, that their
child, who they had sent off to school in the morning, perhaps just weeks away from
graduation, that their life had ended senselessly in an event such as this.

Rubio also points out that schoolchildren are not the only victims of the gun violence
epidemic – he mentions “the murder of children in schools, the murder of
moviegoers, the murder of people at a church, the murder of people at a dance club
on Saturday night” as a way to show that everyone’s lives are in danger. He also
frequently refers to the victims of both the shooting in question and other shootings
as people, which can be seen as a more neutral and less provoking expression than
children. Perhaps this is done to mitigate the outraged response to the shooting – but
most likely it is just a natural choice of words.
He only mentions the shooter Nicolas Cruz once as “yesterday’s killer” and
“assailant” respectively, but mostly refers to shooters in general as someone (9 times)
they (27 times), one person (once) and individual (7 times), and in some instances,
killer (5 times). These descriptions, apart from killer, are quite vague, and especially
the terms one person and individual seem to suggest that these shootings should be
considered isolated incidents that are simply caused by sick people with bad
intentions. The descriptions are also somewhat isolating – the term someone refers to
an unknown or unspecified person, they refers to other people, excluding the speaker
and the group(s) they belong to, one person is a singular person acting on their own
accord, as well as individual. The term killer excludes anyone who is not a killer
themselves. All of these descriptions indicate that the shooters are different from
everyone else, they are outcasts of society – and this is what leads them to commit
violent acts. Nothing is mentioned of the system that enables them to carry firearms,
47

Ella Nordberg
and no solutions are presented as to how firearms could be taken away from people
that are dangerous.
6.4.6. freedom/right(s) and safe(ty)/protect(ion)
Interestingly, Rubio does not mention the word freedom anywhere in his speech
(apart from referring to the United States as “the freest and the most prosperous
nation in all of human history”). Perhaps he feels that the freedom argument has been
overused by Republicans and representatives of the NRA, or perhaps – since he has
previously expressed his parental concern for his daughters in public schools – he
does not want to highlight the stance that guns should be available for just anyone.
It’s cliché-ish to say, but I think it’s important to say that I'm a father of two young
ladies who happen to be in high school. I cannot imagine, but I can only envision
what it would be like, if one day, here, walking through the capital, I get a text or
one of those news alerts that says that there's been a shooting in the high school that
they attend. And I can only imagine how fearful it would be, when suddenly, those
texts are not being answered, and those calls are not being returned. I thought about
that last night, and what it must feel like to be one of those parents at the hotel,
waiting for word, if you hadn’t heard from your children in hours.

However, Rubio does speak about the American right to bear arms, which essentially
carries the same meaning as the freedom argument. He also associates the bearing of
arms with self-defense and defines it as “a right that I strongly support and will
continue to support”.
The word safe is mentioned twice in the speech and protect once. Rubio does seem
to make some concessions in that he recognizes that it is the “obligation of our
government” to keep people safe “from threats both foreign and domestic”. Shooters
are obviously a domestic threat, and he is acknowledging that it is the government’s
responsibility to do something about it. However, despite this, Americans also need
to have the right and be able to “protect themselves”. In other words, their safety
cannot be completely guaranteed by the government, which is why they need to have
the means to take care of themselves.
6.4.7. we/us and they/them
Rubio uses the word we 60 times in his speech. He places himself among the
mourners by using the word we to emphasize that the American people are in this
together.
48

Ella Nordberg
And that’s why we continue to face this, we continue to face these… I think it is a
legitimate thing to say that, even as we mourn, we have an obligation to ask
ourselves: Is there something we could have done, or should do, to ensure that we
don’t see these things happen?

He repeats several times that we “should be able to do something”, however, he
never explicitly states what that “something” is. Instead, Rubio continually claims
that gun laws are ineffective, and that they would have done nothing to prevent the
shooting. He states that “if we do something, it should be something that works”, and
the use of the word “if” leaves it unclear as to whether or not he is actually intending
to take action against the recurring mass shootings.
And so, I hope that we can start to figure it out. I haven’t had the time, frankly, in
less than 18 hours, to bring to the floor a proposal for how we move forward or what
the form would be for this conversation to even begin, but I know that we can no
longer just chalk it up to isolated instances. Because it’s happened too often, and
sadly, I believe, will happen again. So we confront it, try to solve it. And I hope that
we will, and I believe that we can. I believe that we must. For, as I said at the outset,
and I’ll say in conclusion, it goes to the core of why we even exist to begin with:
keeping our people safe – no matter how new, how different, or how unique the
threat may be.

The ending of Rubio’s speech, which appears to be meant as an encouragement to
the people listening, seems to fall rather flat. He frequently uses the word we in order
to make it clear that collective action is needed, but he repeatedly fails to identify
what this action could be – in fact, for most of the speech, Rubio is mainly discussing
why laws do not work. But what else is there for a government to do but implement
new laws? Rubio seems determined to convince the audience about the uselessness
of laws, but in doing so, his message appears rather empty when no alternatives are
offered. It leaves it unclear what the collective we is supposed to fight for, i.e. what
cause it is that is supposed to unite them.
Rubio makes it clear in his speech that he does not believe guns are the issue. Rather,
individuals, identified by Rubio simply as they, are the problem.
They deliberately took steps to get the guns, the weapons, the ammunition that they
needed, in many cases they carefully studied the outline of the target which they
were going to go after. They specifically planned soft targets, there's evidence of that
in this case. And they planned to maximize the loss of life. They acquired the
weapon that they needed, and they used tactics that they needed to kill as many
people as they could. By the way, because of that premeditation and planning, is one
of the reasons why these laws that have been proposed wouldn’t have prevented
49

Ella Nordberg
them. Because when someone is planning and premeditating an attack, they will
figure out a way to evade those laws, or, quite frankly, to comply with them in order
to get around it.

They are the ones who get, acquire and buy weapons to use them in destructive ways
– even guns that have been “outlawed” in a vain effort to reduce gun violence –
whereas guns simply are the things that are needed, gotten, acquired, bought and
used. According to Rubio, if they are determined enough to commit a crime, they will
find a way, regardless of laws. Rubio states that, since guns “last a hundred years”, it
will be a struggle to “keep it [a gun] out” of someone’s hands who has decided to use
it.

7. Findings
People use different nouns, adjectives, attributes, and even prepositions, and the
connotations associated with them, to offer differing points of view about the same
things. This trend can definitely be seen when looking at the four speeches selected
for this analysis, as discussed below.
7.1. Guns
When Gonzalez and Hogg speak about weapons, it is interesting to note that they
speak about them in a rather limited way – Gonzalez talks about guns in a rather
neutral way, and mainly focuses on their easy attainability, which she opposes.
However, she does not explicitly state why guns need to be regulated, nor does she
combine them with unflattering attributes in a way that might be expected. Hogg, on
the other hand, only barely mentions guns in his speech – but when he does, he
makes sure to associate them with the “96 people” whose deaths they cause every
year. Gonzalez speaks about guns in a way that could be expected from someone
who supports gun ownership – as if they were tools that just wound up in the wrong
hands. Hogg’s way to talk about gun is more representative of his stance – he
associates guns with death and violence, and does not consider them to be neutral
tools in the matter, but rather a root cause of the problem.
Similarly to Gonzalez and Hogg, LaPierre and Rubio – despite sharing the same
opinion on gun control – differ drastically in their ways to talk about guns. LaPierre
frequently associates guns with freedom, an important American value, and sees
50

Ella Nordberg
guns as something that gun control activists are trying to take away. In an interesting
shift of blame, LaPierre does combine the word weapon with destructive properties –
however, not while he is speaking about actual weapons, but rather when he talks
about a socialist smear campaign against gun owners, with “character
assassinations”, “targets” and “a growing segment of victims”. All the negative
connotations that are usually combined with guns are suddenly plastered on to those
who do not agree with him. Rubio is more neutral in his presentation and does not
make it obvious that guns need to be protected, but rather speaks about them as
neutral tools without agency, which is why guns in themselves cannot be the cause of
a mass shooting. Guns are things that get “used” by people, who sometimes happen
to have bad intentions, and this is where he and LaPierre agree – guns cannot be
blamed, it is all about the person who shoots. LaPierre associates guns with the
utmost American value, freedom, whereas Rubio sticks to talking about guns as
objects, and avoids combining them with descriptive attributes. Out of the four
speakers, Gonzalez and Rubio seem to have a more objective view on guns, whereas
Hogg has the most negative view and LaPierre the most positive one.
7.2. The Constitution and the Second Amendment
The Constitution and the Second Amendment have always been a large part of the
debate surrounding gun laws, mostly on the side supporting gun ownership. This is
also the case in these four speeches – Gonzalez barely mentions either of these, and
Hogg does not mention them at all. This is understandable when considering their
standpoint, since the existence of the Second Amendment does little to help their
cause. However, since the meaning of the Second Amendment is frequently debated,
they could have included a different interpretation of the amendment into their
speeches. However, it is possible that a full-blown attack on the Second Amendment,
which many Americans consider important, poses a risk of alienating many listeners
and thereby making them reluctant to listen to the message in the speeches.
Therefore it makes sense that Gonzalez and Hogg would focus their attentions
somewhere else.
LaPierre and Rubio both make a point of highlighting the importance of the Second
Amendment for the United States and its people. To LaPierre, the Second
Amendment is something that must be protected at all costs, since it is a symbol and
51

Ella Nordberg
a guarantee of American freedom. There is no valid reason for Democrats to want to
get rid of it – they simply work towards gun control to try and exert their power over
the American people, whom they just love to deny their rights. Stripping people of
their Second Amendment right is, according to LaPierre, just the beginning – once
the “socialists” are done with that, they will work towards removing all the other
freedoms, too. Rubio takes a more subtle approach – he stresses the value of the
Second Amendment by stating that its importance stems from the fact that the
Founding Fathers found it important enough to make it the second of all the
amendments, with only the First Amendment, free speech, preceding it. Due to its
placing in the Constitution, and his role as a senator, Rubio considers it his duty to
protect and support the Second Amendment. The Constitution is given the same
treatment by both LaPierre and Rubio – both see it as a crucial part of American
society and legal system. The Constitution should be protected because it defines the
United States. Threatening to change something in the Constitution should be seen as
a direct threat to American-ness in itself and should therefore not be tolerated.
7.3. Gun control
Gonzalez and Hogg both support gun control, which means that they have a positive
attitude towards laws and regulations concerning weapons. This is also made clear in
the way they speak about laws – Gonzalez speaks about laws as something that need
to change in order to properly reflect modern society, where there is need for them.
She compares the United States to other nations that have implemented gun control,
and paints an unflattering picture of a nation that does not appear to care about the
safety of its citizens. She also criticizes the Trump administration for repealing
already existing regulations that have been designed to limit gun ownership, and
writes this off as “a really dumb idea”. Hogg, on the other hand, does not mention
regulations or laws in his speech at all, probably under the impression that his desire
to implement these changes can be understood well enough from the context from
which he is speaking. Instead, he speaks about a “change” that he and his supporters
will implement in society. Neither of them mentions what would happen to current
gun owners if the desired changes would be implemented, and whether or not their
guns would be taken away from them.

52

When LaPierre speaks about laws, he does it with a vengeance – he presents them as
something created in order to oppress law-abiding American citizens, to strip them of
their rights, and an outright violation of the Constitution. He frequently mentions
how laws have failed to protect American citizens against various ills in society –
drugs, gang violence, illegal immigration – and how they will continue to do so with
mass shootings, because criminals, by definition, do not obey laws. In LaPierre’s
eyes, freedom is the most fundamental American value, and a right that gun control
is meant to infringe upon. LaPierre also goes as far as claiming that gun control in
itself will not be enough to the “socialists” – it is “absolute control” that they are
really after. Rubio, on the other hand, sticks to claiming that laws simply do not
work, and also frequently uses negations to create negative connotations with the
idea of creating new regulations. He also mentions that changes should be made
“without laws”, but fails to mention what kind of changes he is referring to.
7.4. America and the United States
The name of the country had to be included in the analysis in order to explore the
speakers’ values and find out their feelings about the state of their nation. When
Gonzalez speaks about America, it is exclusively with connotations to mass
shootings, i.e. “mass shootings in America” and “the number of gunshot victims in
the United States”. This makes it seem like one of the key elements of the country is
the occurrence of mass shootings. This association is essential to the message, since
Gonzalez is clearly trying to convey the point that shootings are too widespread,
happen too often, and only within the United States. Hogg’s message is different in
that he seems to believe in the future of the nation, and that said future can be
brighter as long as Americans choose to work together. He refuses to divide the
nation into Democrats and Republicans, because, according to him, they are all
“Americans of the same flesh and blood”. Their nationality is what unites them, what
causes them to have a common goal, even if everyone does not realize it. Hogg
makes his patriotism known throughout his speech, but his patriotism is not based on
gun ownership, since that is not what the United States is all about. Instead, his
patriotism is shared on shared ideals and values, in which guns have no part. Hogg
demonstrates that one can be fond of one’s country, even while accepting that it is
not perfect and that some things do need to change.

53

Ella Nordberg
LaPierre, on the other hand, presents those that do not support gun ownership as antiAmerican, and as people who do not share the view and values of so-called real
Americans (of which he, his listeners and the NRA are prime examples). LaPierre
states that America “is the greatest country in the world”, and that individual liberty
is one of the most fundamental values that makes it so. The United States is known
for its freedoms, and those freedoms are currently under threat by gun control
activists – by threatening Americans’ rights to own guns, they are attacking the very
essence of the country itself. Guns are such an essential part of American culture that
LaPierre goes as far as claiming that the right to keep and bear arms is “not bestowed
by man but granted by God to all Americans as our American birthright”. For those
whom the argument of the Constitution does not convince, the argument of God
supporting gun rights should prove persuasive. Rubio follows the same argument as
LaPierre in that Americans do have the right to carry arms and protect themselves in
case of an attack. He also states that the chances are very high that, somewhere in
America, another individual is planning a similar attack as the one being discussed.
The mention of Americans’ right to protect themselves is followed up by the image
of a threat which makes owning guns for self-defense appear necessary, since these
individuals, according to Rubio, cannot be stopped by further gun legislation.
7.5. Victims and perpetrator
One thing that unites all of the four speakers is their way of speaking about the
victims as children, which is reminiscent of Obama’s way of talking about gun
legislation as a parental responsibility, as mentioned earlier. All four speakers make
it clear in their speeches that children need to be protected and that it is the
responsibility of the adults in their lives to guarantee their safety – even if their
opinions on how to achieve this goal differ drastically.
Gonzalez paints the victims of the mass shooting as victims of the Trump
administration’s inaction. She creates a division between “victims” (of mass
shootings) and “our government and President”, whose only action in dealing with
mass shootings has, according to her, been “to send thoughts and prayers”. As she
speaks about the statistics of gun-related deaths in the United States and the sums of
money that the president and his administration have received in donations from the
NRA, she essentially speaks about children who have been sold out and betrayed by
54

Ella Nordberg
a corrupt government. Referring to the victims as children and students highlights
their youth, innocence and vulnerable role in society, which is most likely
intentional. In contrast, she uses the word “adults” to describe those opposing her
message, the implied message being that those adults, who supposedly should be in
charge of her and her friends’ safety, are not fulfilling their responsibility. The
implicit message here is that children should be protected, a value that is shared by
most people and can therefore easily be accepted by the audience. She associates the
students of the school with the consequences that they had to endure because of the
shooting – she refers to them as students that are “dead”, “still in the hospital”,
“suffering from PTSD”, and having panic attacks. While they are stuck with the
consequences of the shooting, they are also forced to take part in debates in schools
about guns and the Second Amendment, and yet, their voices are not being heard in
society. When she speaks about Cruz, she refers to him as the shooter, and
effectively strips him off his name and any other qualities that he may have
possessed. Her mentions of him are kept rather short and she does not speculate too
much on his motivations or personality in general. It is likely that she sees him only
as the symptom of a bigger problem. Gonzalez clearly places blame away from
mental illness and possible exclusion from social circles and towards gun culture and
those supporting and participating in it.
Hogg does not directly refer to the victims in the Parkland shooting, but he does
place a price tag on the podium before beginning his speech. This price tag
represents the sum that, according to Hogg, was received by Senator Marco Rubio
for each life that was lost that day. Hogg is presenting the deaths of those students as
nothing more than a sum of money to the politicians that continue to block attempts
at stricter gun legislations. During the speech, Hogg speaks about children as the
people who suffer most when it comes to mass shootings – they are the future of the
nation, and yet, they are being left without proper protection. He and Gonzalez are
using similar tactics in their way to talk about the victims of mass shootings – as
children, students and young people in general who cannot make important decisions
for themselves despite the fact that their very lives depend on it. Cruz is not
mentioned at all in Hogg’s speech – either because he does not want to give him any
more press and attention than he has already received, or perhaps because he, just
like Gonzalez, considers Cruz to be just a small part of a huge problem.
55

Ella Nordberg
LaPierre also brings out the innocence and helplessness of children by referring to
them as the innocent, schoolchildren, our children, our kids, and innocent child.
However, his solution to the problem differs quite drastically from that of Gonzalez
and Hogg. Instead of getting rid of guns to make sure that children are safe, more
guns should be introduced in order to ward of potential attackers. The protection of
schoolchildren is, according to LaPierre, lacking, since more protection is afforded to
movie stars and politicians (through guns), but not schoolchildren. LaPierre also
abstains from mentioning Cruz directly – instead he speaks about how evil is walking
“among us”, and madmen with guns. As mentioned before, madness and evil are
both difficult to combat through legislation, which seems to indicate that the only
option for protecting oneself and one’s family against such threats is to own firearms.
Rubio also speaks about the victims as children, and highlights his own concern for
the matter through the fact that he, himself, is a parent as well. He also refers to
victims in other ways by using the word people, possibly to avoid emotional
responses from the audience, though it may also be unconscious. He also does not
refer to Cruz by name – and instead calls him “yesterday’s killer” and “assailant” –
and when he speaks about other mass shootings, he uses personal pronouns that
would alienate the listeners from the shooter. He refers to shooters as someone, they,
one person, and individual, and in some instances, killer. Referring to shooters in this
way creates the impression that all shooters are outcasts – someone and they are
words that could refer to mostly anyone apart from the people listening to or
partaking in the conversation, whereas one person and individual create the
impression that the shooters have acted alone and that the incidents are isolated. The
same effect is produced by using the word killer – anyone who is not a killer will not
be able to relate to the shooter. Shooters are to be seen as outcasts and anomalies.
7.6. Freedom vs. safety
Since the entire gun debate hinges upon whether the safety of the many or individual
liberties should take precedence when creating new laws, the way that the speakers
talk about these values needed to be analyzed. Gonzalez does not mention freedom in
her speech at all. She does speak about rights and safety, albeit in different ways.
Rights are mentioned as she is criticizing the NRA and gun supporters in general of
valuing their right to own a gun over students’ right to life. Safety is mentioned in the
56

Ella Nordberg
context of gun safety, which has been implemented in other countries and is,
according to Gonzalez, the solution to the problem of recurring mass shootings. Gun
safety, in this context, should be considered the same thing as gun control. In Hogg’s
speech, neither freedom nor rights are mentioned, since these words are most often
associated with arguments supporting gun ownership. Hogg does, however, talk
about how politicians have, instead of protecting children, chosen to be “protective
of their position, the safety of inaction”. The politicians are thereby more interested
keeping themselves safe than worrying about the safety of the public, which proves
just how corrupted they are.
Freedom, safety and protection all play an important role in LaPierre’s speech.
Individual freedom is under threat from those who “hate” it and want to “eradicate”
all freedoms, and the safety and protection of schoolchildren is being ignored since
using guns to do this is not being considered as an option. Freedoms are very firmly
associated with American values, and a right that is shared by all and cannot be taken
away. The most important freedom, according to LaPierre, is the freedom and the
right to protect oneself – with guns if necessary. The right to own and use weapons is
defined by “the right to survive”, and is even described by LaPierre as an “American
birthright” that has been “granted by God”. Rubio does not place very much
emphasis on freedom in his speech. Instead, he mentions the right of Americans to
bear arms, as he associates it with being able to defend oneself. At the same time,
Rubio acknowledges the safety of the American people to be the responsibility of the
government, which makes his stance on self-defense somewhat contradictory.
7.7. Us vs. them
All of the speakers include their audiences in their usage of the word we. Gonzalez
and Hogg mainly use it as a way to try and inspire their audiences to actively
participate in society in order to make a difference, whereas LaPierre and Rubio
mainly focus on the hardships that all Americans face together due to the repeatedly
occurring mass shootings. LaPierre also uses the word we when referring to himself
and the NRA and how the organization is going to keep fighting for continued gun
rights. However, Rubio, while encouraging collective action, leaves it open what
exactly the collective we is supposed to stand for. No matter who each speaker is

57

Ella Nordberg
referring to, the collective we is always seen as the solution to the existing problem –
even when opinions differ as to what the problem is.
The speakers also differ in who they refer to as they in their speeches. When
Gonzalez and Hogg use the word they, they are referring to the politicians who are in
charge and oppose their message of more gun control. They both believe that the
reason for no gun laws being implemented is the fact that politicians consider their
personal monetary gain more important than the safety of American citizens. Their
point of view in the issue is presented as the only ethical one, since it is implicitly
stating that financial gain cannot by any standards be considered more important than
the personal safety of millions of people. The framing of the issue leaves the
audience no room for disagreement. The politicians are accused of taking bribes in
exchange for children’s lives.
LaPierre and Rubio, on the other hand, have their own ideas about who they, or the
enemy, is – LaPierre uses the word when he is referring to Democrats, “socialists”
and gun control activists in general, whereas Rubio uses the word when he is
referring to the actual shooter(s). The use of this word makes it very clear where each
speaker believes that the core of the problem lies – which also affects what they
consider the best way to handle the problem.
8. Discussion
The four speakers in this analysis represent two differing viewpoints on gun control.
One of the viewpoints supports the implementation of stricter gun control, whereas
the other does not. Gonzalez and Hogg present gun control as something necessary in
order to save lives, whereas LaPierre presents the idea as a ploy by Democrats to
gain more control and Rubio simply points out the futility of gun control. The fact
that there is a problem in American society is accepted by each speaker, but it is
identified differently. Gonzalez and Hogg believe the availability of guns causes the
problem of mass shootings, LaPierre believes that the essential American value,
freedom, is being threatened, and Rubio, while accepting that mass shootings are an
all-too common problem, believes that new gun laws are ineffective and that other
solutions to mass shootings should be considered. In other words, a shared discourse
has given rise to a number of different representations, and these representations
illustrate the values, beliefs and thought processes of their speakers.
58

Ella Nordberg
The issue of guns has been debated for a long time in the United States, and although
the aim of this thesis has been to discover how the selected words, i.e. the choices
that speakers make and the attributes and connotations they use in their definitions
impact their message, and whether the participation of people who actually
experienced the shooting themselves would bring any new insights into the debate, it
turns out that the decades-old debate has changed very little during the years. This
can be seen from the fact that, in describing the gun debate earlier in the thesis,
almost all of the arguments used by each speaker in the aftermath of the Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School shooting could be found to have been used before,
such as the futility argument identified by Henigan (2016), which was used by both
LaPierre and Rubio in their speeches to make the point that gun laws are essentially
useless.
The definition and purpose of guns was one of the things that the speakers
expectedly disagreed on – while Gonzalez and Hogg saw them as threats to society,
LaPierre and Rubio identified them as means to acquire safety and as tools with no
agency and therefore also no part in the blame for the mass shootings they are being
used in. The importance of the Second Amendment was only mentioned by those
supporting gun ownership, and gun control was either presented as something
necessary or as a slippery slope into the complete banning of firearms, and thereby
control of American citizens. The warrant of the dead, or the belief that the fate of
those who have died due to gun violence places certain responsibilities on the living,
was used by both Gonzalez and Hogg – Gonzalez uses it when she speaks about the
students who are dead and had not needed to be, and Hogg uses it when he speaks of
the children that have been, and are being, gunned down. In a predicted move,
LaPierre counters the warrant of the dead in his speech by claiming that “the
opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain”. Even Rubio
mentions the lack of a “mourning period”, which according to him used to be the
norm before policy changes would be discussed. The importance of guns for the
United States and their inclusion in the Constitution were only mentioned by
LaPierre and Rubio. Even though Hogg’s speech was patriotic in its message, guns
were not considered by him to be an important reason for American greatness.
It is not that surprising that all of the speakers would use the same language when
talking about the victims of the shooting – after all, the victims were children, and
59

Ella Nordberg
most people would agree that protecting the young and vulnerable in society is a
social good and frame the issue similarly to Obama as a parental responsibility.
However, I did expect the speakers to use different language when it came to the
shooter. I would have thought that at least one of the speakers might try to minimize
the role of Nicolas Cruz in the tragedy, perhaps calling him a “kid” and thereby
highlighting his youth and thereby his vulnerability to things such as violent media
and video games. However, none of the speakers seemed interested in letting him off
the hook for the crimes he committed – in the selected speeches, he was mentioned
either briefly, indirectly or not at all. This may be due to the fact that the speakers
believe such a standpoint would not resonate with the crowd they are facing, or
perhaps they all just agree that Cruz does carry a lot of the blame. In any case, this
similarity in rhetoric from four different speakers was somewhat surprising.
As mentioned earlier in this thesis, issues that are difficult to incorporate into one’s
own argument are typically left unmentioned, and the selected speeches are no
different in this regard. As van Eemeren and Houtlosser (1999) predicted, each of the
speakers chose to make use of the material that was the most beneficial for them,
while ignoring the parts of the discourse that would have presented challenges for
their agenda. Gonzalez and Hogg both choose not to bring up the meaning of the
Second Amendment in American society, nor the supposed benefits of guns for selfdefense or the question of how to prevent criminals from getting access to guns
already in circulation – issues that are often brought up by gun activists and owners.
They do not mention the word freedom, which is thought to be one of the
fundamental values of American society and frequently found in arguments
supporting gun ownership. There is also no mention of exactly what kinds of
regulations should be implemented on the purchase of firearms. LaPierre and Rubio
make no mention of alternative courses of action if new laws are not an option.
Essentially, the speakers simply choose not to deal with difficult issues so as not to
hurt their own cause. The argument of whether freedom or safety should be
considered the more important social good, remains unresolved.
In order to avoid this pitfall in future research, it would be helpful if the keywords
chosen for analysis would be ones that are previously determined to have been used
by each speaker. This would make the comparison of values, attitudes and persuasive
definitions significantly easier and potentially much more interesting.
60

Ella Nordberg
9. Conclusion
The aim of this thesis has been to find out how people on opposing sides of the gun
debate will make use of the same keywords in different ways to further their
arguments. The hypothesis in the beginning of the thesis was that, even though the
speakers may use the same words, they will present them and ascribe meaning to
them in different ways to make sure that their arguments are supported. This will be
done through methods such as framing, persuasive definitions, appealing to emotions
and responsibilities, and loaded language. A person arguing that guns are dangerous
weapons that should be subjected to harsher regulations will be likely to assign
different attributes to guns than a person arguing that guns should continue to be
available to civilians.
The analysis found that this was, indeed, the case. The four speakers assigned
different definitions and meanings to almost all of the selected keywords, apart from
the victims of the attack and the gunman, which indicated that their opinions about
the innocence of the victims and the guilt of the perpetrator were roughly the same.
Some of the keywords were left out by some of the speakers, and this could often be
attributed to the fact that, even though the keyword appears frequently in most
discussions about guns, this particular keyword could not be used by the speaker in a
way that would support their cause. The speakers would also, apart from having
different definitions of the keywords used, paint the opposing side of the debate in an
unflattering light, and assign attributes to them in a way that would make them seem
as unworthy of support by the audiences the speakers were facing. The gun
advocates were presented by the opposing side as people who were supporting
current gun legislation simply for personal monetary gain, whereas the gun control
advocates were presented by the opposing sides as people who desire control for its
own sake and as supporters of laws that have repeatedly proved to be ineffective.
It does not appear that the debate is going to end any time soon, especially as long as
the arguments that have already been used in the debate for decades continue to be
recycled time and time again. Whether any real progress in the fight against
continued mass shootings is on the horizon, remains to be seen.

Svensk sammanfattning
”Vi har inget vapenproblem, endast ett människoproblem”: nyckelord i den
amerikanska vapendebatten och deras varierande användning
Inledning
Civilpersoners rätt att bära vapen i USA har debatterats i många årtionden, och
debatten pågår än idag. Debatten om huruvida det andra tillägget (Second
Amendment) i landets rättighetsförklaring (Bill of Rights) som skrevs på 1700-talet
fortfarande kan gälla i dagens läge är en omtvistad och väldigt polariserad fråga,
både bland politiker och den allmänna befolkningen. Masskjutningar på allmänna
ställen såsom skolor, konserter och nattklubbar händer alltför ofta, men trots detta är
begränsningarna för ägandet av vapen obefintliga och ingen klar lösning på
problemet har tillsvidare hittats.
I denna avhandling undersöker jag fyra olika tal som följde skjutningen i Marjory
Stoneman Douglas High School i Parkland, Florida den 14 februari 2018. Nicolas
Cruz, en elev i skolan, tog sig in i skolbyggnaden beväpnad och började skjuta. 17
människor miste livet och 17 skadades. Skjutningen ledde till proteströrelsen March
for Our Lives, som organiserades av studerande som överlevt skjutningen. Rörelsens
uppgift var att framföra nödvändigheten av striktare vapenlagar i USA. Rörelsen
hade också sina motståndare, huvudsakligen lobbygruppen National Rifle
Association (NRA), vapenägare och andra som understöder den amerikanska rätten
att bära vapen.
De två första talen hölls av Emma Gonzalez och David Hogg, båda studerande som
överlevde skjutningen och blev välkända för sitt deltagande i March for Our Lives.
De höll sina tal framför stora publiker som hade samlats för att protestera alltför
effektlösa vapenlagar. De två andra talen hölls av den republikanska politikern
Marco Rubio och Wayne LaPierre, vd:n för NRA. Rubio talade inför senaten en dag
efter skjutningen, och LaPierre framförde sina åsikter inför en stor publik av
vapenägare och NRA-medlemmar under Conservative Political Action-konferensen i
februari 2018.
Avhandlingens syfte är att genomföra en diskursanalys av de fyra talen med hjälp av
ett antal förvalda nyckelord. Jag undersöker ordval som kombineras med dessa
62

Ella Nordberg
nyckelord för att identifiera attityder och fördomar bakom argumentationerna.
Nyckelorden innefattar:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Ord som betecknar vapen (gun/firearm/weapon/arms)
Ord som hänvisar till aktuell lag (Second Amendment, Constitution)
Ord som hänvisar till eventuell lag
(law/control/regulation/ban/legislation)
Ord som betecknar USA (America, United States)
Ord som relaterar till frihet och trygghet (freedom/rights och
safety/protection)
Ord som betecknar offren och gärningsmannen
Ord som betecknar den egna och den andra sidan av debatten (we/us,
they/them)

Jag undersöker hur varje talare använder sig av dessa ord och vilka adjektiv och
attribut de kombinerar med dem. Detta borde avslöja även undangömda attityder och
argument som inte nödvändigtvis yttras i sin helhet.
Teori
Framing inom lingvistik handlar om att skapa ett s.k. ramverk inom vilket ett visst
tema kommer att behandlas, och fastställer därmed vad som anses viktigt. När det
gäller masskjutningar kan olika ramverk vara avgörande för vem som anses skyldig
för skjutningen – handlar det om en enskild aktör med eventuella mentala störningar,
eller borde man skylla på våldsamma videospel? Ligger skulden hos vapenhandlare
som garanterar enkel tillgång till vapen? Är vapenproblemet överhuvudtaget ett
vapenproblem, eller är problemet egentligen att människor är onda? Framing är ett
avgörande medel för hur problem presenteras till allmänheten och därmed hur
allmänheten förstår dem.
Utöver detta använder sig talarna av strategisk manövrering – ett argumentationssätt
vars syfte är att hjälpa människor bringa fram de aspekter av en situation som
framhäver deras position och som kan enkelt accepteras av deras publik, såsom t.ex.
argumentet att barn bör vara säkra i skolan. Det är svårt att vara oense om denna
synpunkt, vilket skapar en ideal utgångspunkt för ett antal andra argument, t.ex. att
vapen bör hållas utanför skolor.

63

Ella Nordberg
Analys av talen
De olika utgångspunkterna för dessa tal innebär att talarna kommer att presentera
sina egna tolkningar av nyckelorden och kombinera dem med sina uppfattningar av
vad problemet egentligen utgörs av.

Emma Gonzalez och David Hogg
Gonzalez talar om vapen på ett relativt neutralt sätt. Hon påpekar att de har
förändrats mycket sedan det andra tillägget i rättighetsförklaringen introducerades
och att de är alltför lätta att få tag på. Hon hävdar också att vapen inte kan jämföras
med andra verktyg såsom knivar eftersom de är betydligt farligare i fel händer. Inget
av det Gonzalez säger tyder på att hon anser att vapen skulle vara onda i sig själva,
men det är tydligt att hon vill införa flera begränsningar för människor som vill
skaffa dem. Hogg pratar om vapen på ett sätt som tyder på att de är onda i sig själva,
i och med att han hävdar att vapen orsakar amerikanska dödsfall. Ingendera
inkluderar det andra tillägget i sina argument, vilket tyder på att dess roll inte anses
viktig av dessa talare. Bortlämningen kan också tyda på att Hogg och Gonzalez inte
är säkra på hur de kan använda sig av det andra tillägget utan att skada sitt budskap.
Båda talarna har en positiv inställning till nya lagar, vilket framkommer ur deras sätt
att tala om dem. Gonzalez presenterar lagar som den tydliga lösningen på
vapenproblemet, medan Hogg inte direkt pratar om lagar utan om önskvärd
förändring, vilket i denna situation kan tolkas som införandet av nya lagar. Gonzalez
nämner USA endast i samband med skjutningar, vilket skapar en föga smickrande
bild av situationen i landet. Hogg nämner USA flera gånger i sitt tal, men hans
definition av en ideal version av USA innefattar inte rätten att äga vapen, utan
snarare ett enat folk med samma mål.
Varken Gonzalez eller Hogg nämner frihetsargumentet i sina tal, vilket är förståeligt
med tanke på att deras mål är att skapa flera begränsningar, men också överraskande
i och med att frihet anses vara ett av de främsta amerikanska värderingarna och en av
de viktigaste orsakerna för den fortsatta rätten att äga vapen. Gonzalez hänvisar inte
heller till att människornas säkerhet måste tryggas – vilket är förvånansvärt med
tanke på hennes önskemål – men hävdar att andra länder som tagit itu med sina
64

Ella Nordberg
vapenproblem har infört ”vapentrygghet” (gun safety), vilket har lett till det
minskade antalet masskjutningar i andra länder, ett exempel som hon önskar att USA
skulle följa. Hogg nämner inte heller skolelevers säkerhet i sitt tal, men talar istället
om hur beslutsfattare har beslutat att trygga sin egen säkerhet på befolkningens
bekostnad. Härmed presenteras de som korrupta.
Wayne LaPierre och Marco Rubio
På samma sätt som med Gonzalez och Hogg skiljer sig LaPierres och Rubios sätt att
tala om vapen, trots att de delar samma åsikt gällande vapenlagar. LaPierre
associerar vapen med frihet, och anser att rätten att äga vapen garanterar fortsatt
frihet för den amerikanska befolkningen. Rubios sätt att prata om vapen påminner
om Gonzalez sätt att prata om dem – som objekt. Vapen är enligt Rubio endast
verktyg som används av människor, och människornas användningssätt kan vara
antingen goda eller onda. Vapen kan alltså inte tilldelas skulden av masskjutningar,
eftersom dådet alltid begås av en människa. När det gäller det andra tillägget
presenterar LaPierre det som något som måste beskyddas, eftersom det garanterar
amerikansk frihet. Försöken att avskaffa det andra tillägget anses av LaPierre vara ett
medel som demokraterna vill använda sig av för att stegvis kunna avskaffa allt fler
amerikanska rättigheter och därigenom kunna utöva mer kontroll över befolkningen.
Rubio anser att det andra tillägget är viktigt för amerikansk lag, eftersom USA:s
grundlagsfäder ansåg att tillägget var så viktigt att de bestämde att det skulle bli det
andra tillägget, direkt efter det första tillägget som tryggar yttrandefriheten.
När LaPierre pratar om nya lagar, associerar han dem med mer statlig kontroll över
den amerikanska befolkningen, vilket han ser som en kränkning av deras rättigheter.
Han hävdar att eftersom lagar inte har kunnat skydda amerikaner mot droger, olaglig
immigration och gängvåld kommer de inte heller att skydda dem mot kriminella –
som till skillnad från laglydiga amerikaner kommer att kunna beväpna sig trots
ytterligare vapenlagar, eftersom kriminella inte bryr sig om lagar till att börja med.
Rubio har inte en lika negativ attityd mot nya lagar som LaPierre, men han gör det
klart att han också anser att nya lagar är ineffektiva. Han hävdar att förändring borde
åstadkommas ”utan lagar”, men nämner inte vad detta skulle innebära. När LaPierre
och Rubio talar om USA, presenterar LaPierre människor som stöder nya vapenlagar
som antiamerikanska, eftersom han anser att rätten att äga vapen är en viktig del av
65

Ella Nordberg
amerikansk kultur. Han hävdar till och med att den amerikanska rätten att bära vapen
har kommit från Gud. Rubio anser att den amerikanska rätten att äga vapen direkt
hänger ihop med rätten till självförsvar. Han hävdar också att det är mycket sannolikt
att någon individ i USA redan planerar en liknande attack som masskjutningen i
Parkland. Utöver att hävda att amerikaner har rätten att försvara sig själva med
vapen, skapar Rubio också en hotbild som får lyssnarna att anse att denna rättighet är
av yttersta vikt.
Frihet är definitivt det främsta nyckelordet i LaPierres tal. Han anser att frihet är en
av de viktigaste, om inte den viktigaste amerikanska värderingen, och att den måste
beskyddas. När det gäller trygghet anser LaPierre att mer vapen för med sig trygghet
i och med att beväpnade personer inte är ideala offer för kriminella. Han hävdar att,
eftersom vapen kan skydda så viktiga saker som banker och själva presidenten, är det
ologiskt att hävda att vapen inte för med sig säkerhet – och eftersom vapen kan
skydda välkända och förmögna personer, kan de också användas för att skydda
skolelever. Rubio använder sig inte direkt av frihetsargumentet, men hävdar istället
att människor bör ha rätten att försvara sig själva. Samtidigt hävdar han också att det
är statens skyldighet att skydda befolkningen, vilket verkar en aning motstridigt.

Offren och gärningsmannen behandlas av alla fyra talare på nästan samma sätt, med
några små variationer. Varje talare hänvisar till offren som barn, vars trygghet måste
säkras av beslutsfattare. Åsikterna om hur detta mål ska uppnås varierar betydligt,
men målet är detsamma. Gärningsmannens namn nämns inte en enda gång i något av
de fyra talen, och de gånger som han nämns, händer det oftast på ett sätt som endast
identifierar honom som en skytte utan andra egenskaper.
Alla talare inkluderar sig själva och sina lyssnare i beteckningen vi. Gonzalez och
Hogg använder ordet för att aktivera sina lyssnare och få dem att sträva efter striktare
vapenlagar. LaPierre och Rubio använder ordet för att binda sig samman med
publiken och framhäva att skjutningarna påverkar alla i samhället. LaPierre använder
ordet också för att beteckna sig själv och NRA och hur organisationen kommer att
fortsätta kämpa för den fortsatta rättigheten att bära vapen. Oberoende av vem som
talar, presenteras det kollektiva vi alltid som lösningen på problemet, medan de som
lämnas utanför definitionen presenteras som problemet. När Gonzalez och Hogg

Ella Nordberg
pratar om dem hänvisar de till politiker och andra beslutsfattare som inte aktivt
strävar efter strängare vapenlagar. LaPierres användning av ordet de betecknar
demokrater, socialister och aktivister, medan Rubio använder ordet då han talar om
masskjutningars gärningsmän. De personer som betecknas som problemet påverkar
givetvis hur talarna anser att situationen borde hanteras.
Sammanfattning
De fyra talen som diskuteras i denna avhandling representerar två olika sidor i
vapendebatten – sidan som strävar efter ytterligare vapenlagar, och sidan som inte
gör det. Varje talare verkar acceptera att det finns ett problem, men definitionerna av
problemet varierar.
Analysen av talen visar att varje talare presenterar nyckelorden på ett varierande sätt.
De enda definitionerna som inte innehöll många skillnader var definitionerna av
offren och gärningsmannen. Definitionerna av de andra nyckelorden, varav de flesta
hade att göra med policy, varierade betydligt mer. Trots detta visar analysen att
vapendebatten inte har ändrats betydligt under de tiotals år som vapenägande har
debatterats. En lösning på problemet med masskjutningar verkar inte sannolikare nu
än för femtio år sedan.

Emma Gonzalez
They haven’t already had a moment of silence in the House of Representatives, so I would
like to have another one. Thank you.
Every single person up here today, all these people should be at home grieving. But instead
we are up here standing together because if all our government and President can do is
send thoughts and prayers, then it’s time for victims to be the change that we need to see.
Since the time of the Founding Fathers and since they added the Second Amendment to the
Constitution, our guns have developed at a rate that leaves me dizzy. The guns have
changed, and the laws have not. We certainly do not understand why it should be harder to
make plans with friends on weekends than it is to buy an automatic or semi-automatic
weapon. In Florida, to buy a gun you do not need a permit, you do not need a gun license,
and once you buy it you do not need to register it. You do not need a permit to carry a
concealed rifle or shotgun. You can buy as many guns as you want at one time.
I read something very powerful to me today. It was from the point of view of a teacher. And
I quote: “When adults tell me I have the right to own a gun, all I can hear is ‘my right to own
a gun outweighs your student’s right to live.’ All I can hear is mine, mine, mine, mine.”
Instead of worrying about our AP Gov chapter 16 test, we have to be studying our notes to
make sure that our arguments based on politics and political history are watertight. The
students at this school have been having debates on guns for what feels like our entire
lives. AP Gov had about three debates this year. Some discussions on the subject even
occurred during the shooting while students were hiding in the closets. The people involved
right now, those who were there, those posting, those tweeting, those doing interviews
and talking to people, are being listened to for what feels like the very first time about this
topic that has come up over 1,000 times in the past four years alone.
I found out today, that there’s a website called shootingtracker.com. Nothing in the title
suggests that it is exclusively tracking the USA’s shootings and yet, does it need to address
that? Because Australia had one mass shooting in 1999 in Port Arthur (and after the)
massacre introduced gun safety, and it hasn’t had one since. Japan has never had a mass
shooting. Canada has had three and the UK had one and they both introduced gun control
and yet here we are, with websites dedicated to reporting these tragedies so that they can
be formulated into statistics at your convenience.
I watched an interview this morning and noticed that one of the questions was, “Do you
think your children will have to go through other school shooter drills?” And our response is
that our neighbors will not have to go through other school shooter drills when we have
had our say with the government — and maybe the adults have gotten used to saying “it is
what it is,” but if us students have learned anything, it’s that if you don’t study, you will fail.

71

Ella Nordberg
And in this case, if you actively do nothing, people will continually end up dead, so it’s time
to start doing something.
We are going to be the kids that you read about in textbooks. Not because we’re going to
be another statistic about mass shootings in America, but because, just as David said, we
are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v. Des Moines, we are going to
change the law. That’s going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook and it’s all
going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family
members and most importantly, the students. The students who are dead, the students still
in the hospital, the students who are now suffering from PTSD, the students who had panic
attacks during the vigil because the helicopters who wouldn’t leave us alone, hovering over
the school for 24 hours a day.
There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. “So many signs that the Florida shooter
was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and
classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities
again and again.” We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no
surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how
we should have not ostracized him, you didn’t know this kid! OK, we did. We know that
they are claiming that there are mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we
need to pay attention to the fact that this isn’t just a mental health issue. He wouldn’t have
hurt that many students with a knife!
And how about we stop blaming the victims for something that was the shooter’s fault, the
fault of the people who let him buy the guns in the first place, those at the gun shows, the
people who encouraged him to buy accessories for his guns to make them fully automatic,
the people who didn’t take them away from him when they knew that he expressed
homicidal tendencies, and I am not talking about the FBI. I am talking about the people that
he lived with. I’m talking about the neighbors who saw him outside holding guns!
If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible
tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is
going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from
the National Rifle Association. And hey, you wanna know something? It doesn’t matter
because I already know! Thirty million dollars! And divided by the number of gunshot
victims in the United States in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out
to being $5,800. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don’t do
anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go
up and the number that they are worth will go down! And we will be worthless to you! To
every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you.
If your money was as threatened as us, would your first thought be, “How is this going to
reflect on my campaign? Which should I choose?” Or would you choose us, and if you
answered us, will you act like it for once? You know what would be a good way to act like
it? I have an example of how to not to act like it. In February of 2017, one year ago,
President Trump repealed an Obama-era regulation that would have made it easier to block
the sale of firearms to people with certain mental illnesses.
72

Ella Nordberg
From the interactions that I had had with the shooter before the shooting and the
information that I currently know about him, I don’t really know if he was mentally ill. But
still, I wrote this before I heard what Delaney said. Delaney said that he was diagnosed. I
don’t need a psychologist and I don’t need to be a psychologist to know that repealing that
regulation was a really dumb idea. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa was the sole
sponsor on this bill that stops the FBI from performing background checks on people
adjudicated to be mentally ill and now he’s stating for the record, “Well, it’s a shame the
FBI isn’t doing background checks on these mentally ill people.” Well, duh. You took that
opportunity away last year!
The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem
to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call BS. Companies trying to make
caricatures of the teenagers nowadays, saying that all we are self-involved and trendobsessed, and they hush us into submission, when our message doesn’t reach the ears of
the nation, we are prepared to call BS. Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate
seats funded by the NRA, telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we
call BS. They say that tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say
a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools
like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say that no laws could have been
able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us
kids don’t know what we’re talking about, that we’re too young to understand how the
government works. We call BS.
If you agree, register to vote. Contact your local congresspeople. Give them a piece of your
mind.

David Hogg
First off, I’m gonna start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to
know how much Marco Rubio took for every student’s life in Florida. One dollar and five
cents.
The cold grasp of corruption shackles the District of Columbia. The winter is over. Change is
here. The sun shines on a new day, and the day is ours. First-time voters show up 18
percent of the time at midterm elections. Not anymore. Now, who here is gonna vote in the
2018 election? If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking. They’ve
gotten used to being protective of their position, the safety of inaction. Inaction is no longer
safe. And to that, we say: No more.
Ninety-six people die every day from guns in our country, yet most representatives have no
public stance on guns. And to that, we say: No more. We are going to make this the voting
issue. We are going to take this to every election, to every state, in every city. We are going
to make sure the best people get in our elections to run, not as politicians, but as
Americans. Because this — this is not cutting it. When people try to suppress your vote, and
there are people who stand against you because you’re too young, we say: No more.
When politicians say that your voice doesn’t matter because the NRA owns them, we say:
No more. When politicians send their thoughts and prayers with no action, we say: No
more. And to those politicians supported by the NRA, that allow the continued slaughter of
our children and our future, I say: Get your résumés ready.
Today is the beginning of spring, and tomorrow is the beginning of democracy. Now is the
time to come together, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans. Americans
of the same flesh and blood, that care about one thing and one thing only, and that’s the
future of this country and the children that are going to lead it.
Now, they will try to separate us in demographics. They will try to separate us by religion,
race, congressional district and class. They will fail. We will come together. We will get rid
of these public servants that only serve the gun lobby, and we will save lives. You are those
heroes.
Lastly, let’s put the USA over the NRA. This is the start of the spring and the blossoming of
our democracy. So let’s take this to our local legislators, and let’s take this to midterm
elections, because without the persistence — heat — without the persistence of voters and
Americans everywhere, getting out to every election, democracy will not flourish. But it
can, and it will. So, I say to those politicians that say change will not come, I say: We will not
stop until every man, every woman, every child, and every American can live without fear
of gun violence. And to that, I say: No more.
Thank you, I love you all, God bless all of you, and God bless America. We can, and we will,
change the world.

Ella Nordberg
Wayne LaPierre
Thank you very much. I appreciate this opportunity. We have serious discussions ahead and
serious issues that impact each and every one of us.
Just a week ago, we were all horrified by another terrible tragedy at an American school.
Each and every member of the National Rifle Association mourns the loss of the innocent
and continues to keep their families and that community in our prayers. We share a goal of
safe schools, safe neighborhoods, and a safe country. As usual, the opportunists wasted not
one second to exploit tragedy for political gain. Saul Alinski would have been proud. The
break back speed of calls for more gun control laws and the breathless national media
eager to smear the NRA.
Think about that, in the midst of genuine grief, and a very understandable passion, as
millions of Americans searched for meaningful solutions, what do we find? Chris Murphy,
Nancy Pelosi, and more, cheered on by the national media, eager to blame the NRA and call
for even more government control. They hate the NRA. They hate the Second Amendment.
They hate individual freedom. In the rush of calls for more government, they also revealed
their true selves. The elites don't care, not one wit about America's school system. And
schoolchildren. If they truly cared, what they would do is they would protect them. For
them, it is not a safety issue. It is a political issue. They care more about control and more
of it. Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment and our firearms freedoms, so they
can eradicate all individual freedoms.
What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding. Think about that, their solution is
to make you, all of you less free. They want to sweep right under the carpet the failure of
school security, the failure of family, the failure of America's mental health system, and
even the unbelievable failure of the FBI. They fantasize about more laws, stopping what
other laws failed to stop. The truth is, laws succeed only when people obey them. That's
what the law-abiding majority in this country practices. But once again, so many existing
laws were ignored. Their laws don't stop illegal criminals from crossing our borders every
single day. Their laws don't stop the scourge of gang violence and drug crime that savages
Baltimore, Chicago, and every major American community. Their laws haven't stopped the
plague of opioids, and Chinese fentanyl from Mexico, that floods American streets and kills
victims every single day in this country. No wonder law-abiding Americans, all over this
country, revere their Second Amendment freedom to protect themselves more than ever.
They don't care if their laws work or not. They just want to get more laws, to get more
control over people. But the NRA, the NRA does care. We at the NRA are Americans who
continue to mourn and care and work every day at contributing real solutions to this very
real problem. Real practical action, to truly protect our children. Think about it. It is a
bizarre fact that in this country our jewelry stores, all over this country, are more important
than our children. Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office
buildings, our movie stars, our politicians, they're all more protected than our children at
school. Does that make any sense to anybody? Do we really love our money and our
celebrities more than we love our children? Can we answer that question honestly? Any of
us. Can we answer that question honestly? Knowing that we surround and protect so much
with armed security while we drop our kids off at school that are so-called gun free zones,
that are wide open targets for any crazy mad man bent on evil to come there first.

75

Ella Nordberg
In every community in America, school districts, PTAs, teachers' unions, local law
enforcement, moms and dads, they all must come together to implement the very best
strategy to harden their schools, including effective trained armed security that will
absolutely protect every innocent child in this country. And that has to happen now. Evil
walks among us. And God help us if we don't harden our schools and protect our kids. The
whole idea from some of our opponents that armed security makes us less safe is
completely ridiculous. If that's true, and just think about this, if that's true, armed security
makes us less safe, let's just go ahead and remove it from everywhere. Let's remove it from
the White House, from Capitol Hill, and remove it from all of Hollywood. Any American
school that needs immediate professional consultation and help with organizing and
defining these solutions should call the National Rifle Association school shield program.
And we will provide immediate assistance and we will also provide it absolutely free to any
school in America.
I'll tell you this, that's more than anybody at the Democratic National Committee or NBC
News or the "Washington Post" is offering. The – But you know what, the shameful
politization of tragedy, it is a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous
movement. In my three decades of leading the NRA, I've had the pleasure of working with a
number of Democrats who believe America to be the greatest country in the world,
because of our free market capitalism, and because of our individual liberties. But during
the last decade, the Obama decade, many of those leaders have been forced out as a tidal
wave of new European style socialists seize control of the Democratic Party. Obama
promised a fundamental transformation of our country. And you know what, it began with
his own national party. A party that is now infested with saboteurs who don't believe in
capitalism, don't believe in the Constitution, don't believe in our freedom, and don't believe
in America as we know it. Obama may be gone, but their utopian dream, it marches on.
And President Trump's election, while crucial, can't turn away the wave of these new
European style socialists bearing down upon us. I'm not just talking about Bernie Sanders. I
mean, he's near the end of his career. But how about Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bill
de Blasio, Andrew Como, Cory Booker, Christopher Murphy and Keith Ellison? They are not
Democrats in the mold of John F. Kennedy or Tip O'Neill. They hide behind labels like
Democrat, left wing and progressive to make their socialist agenda more palatable. And
that is terrifying. That should terrify every citizen who values the American ideal in this
country of individual liberty. They politicize the Department of Justice. They weaponize the
internal revenue service. The EPA. Perhaps cripple the FBI. And the Intelligence Community.
And seized an embedded leadership in all of them to advance their agenda. Absolute
control in every corner of our government is their ultimate dream. These intellectual leads,
they think they're smarter than we are. They think they're smarter than the rest of us. And
they think they're better than we are. They truly believe it, and you know it.
The privileged and the powerful, they think they deserve to be in charge of every lever of
power. But you know what, the United States Constitution makes it absolutely clear that
they are not in charge. We, the people, are in charge of this country. But Washington, oh,
my gosh, this city, he likes to ignore that. Our Intelligence Community shrouds everything in
secrecy, driving into darkness every dirty memo and every dirty institutional secret and
memory in the name of national security. But when the leaks come, as so often occurs, in
the light of day, it reveals nothing about the security of our country and it reveals
everything about the corruption of those in power. That's because in a captive society the
76

Ella Nordberg
loss of transparency results in the loss of truth. They also eliminated turnover assistance of
wrongdoing in these great institutions. There is no stronger supporter of our law
enforcement than the National Rifle Association.
My gosh, we're one of the largest law enforcement organizations in the United States if you
look at our membership. And we're proud of that. Everywhere I go I get a police officer
coming up to me, thanking me and saying I'm a member of your organization, keep up what
you're doing. And there are tens of thousands of incredible men and women at the FBI.
These are honorable, decent, hardworking people, and they're dedicated to keeping our
country safe every single day. And we're proud of them and we thank them. But as we have
learned in recent months, even the FBI is not free of its own corruption. And its own
unethical agents. Look, and I know you probably all share this sentiment and I get people
telling me from coast to coast, and they shake their heads when they say it to me. I can
understand a few bad apples in their organization as large as the FBI, but what is hard to
understand is why no one at the FBI stood up and called BS on its rogue leadership. I mean,
really, where was the systemic resistance and repulsion that should protect every powerful
institution that serves us. The lowest ranking marine knows to resist an unlawful order. The
rank and file in every powerful institution must police its own leadership. But still, too much
of today's Washington, no one speaks out. No one challenges authority. Everyone keeps
their mouth closed and their heads down and that's exactly how socialist societies function.
When leaders do whatever they want, when resistance and repercussion disappears, and
when the fundamental concept of moral behavior is expunged, the state rules the day. And
anyone who attempts to resist is smeared right into submission. You know it. Yes, the art of
the smear. We do live in the socialistic age of the art of the smear. Doesn't have to be true.
It just has to stick somewhere. Anywhere. It is designed to degrade, destroy, and it is all
over the national media to serve their agenda. And socialism is a movement that loves a
smear. Racist, misogynist, sexist, xenophobe and more. These are the weapons and vitriol
these character assassinations scream to permanently hang on their targets and create a
growing segment of victims. Because socialism feeds off manipulated victims. You name the
group, and they will find a way to turn them into victims. They keep their movement
growing by finding someone to be offended by something every minute of every day. From
the Occupy movement, to Black Lives Matter, to Antifa, they agitate the offended, promote
uncivil discourse and ignore any sense of due process and fairness to destroy their enemies.
The illumination of due process is the very gold standard of the socialist state.
Imagine this, and this happened, and it is true, imagine telling an elderly couple that
because they sought help to do their taxes, that they could no longer exercise their
fundamental Second Amendment right. That's exactly what Obama did. His administration
proposed that some social security recipient who granted financial authority to a family
member, friend or financial professional was banned from purchasing a firearm. No
questions asked. Just like that. Good, law abiding people were automatically and unjustly
declared mentally incompetent and put on a new government list. And, oh how socialists
love to make lists, especially lists that can be used to deny citizens their basic freedoms.
And now some people are calling for a new list, of anyone, anyone who sought mental
health care to deny them their Second Amendment rights. Look, and this is really
important, and you never hear this on the national media, so I want to say it to all of you
now and I need your help in telling all the Americans, this is the truth. The National Rifle
Association originated the national instant check system, it was our bill. No one on the
77

Ella Nordberg
prohibited persons list should ever have access to a firearm. No killer, no felon, no drug
dealer. And anyone that is adjudicated is mentally incompetent or danger to society should
be added to the check system and prevented from getting their hands on a gun.
*VIDEOTAPE*
Now, here's the real tragedy. Charles Schumer shook my hand to get all the mental health
records into the system and then went back to Capitol Hill and you know what he did,
absolutely nothing. How many lives might have been saved if he had just kept his promise?
They are liars to the core and I'll make this prediction right now. A year from today, many of
those records may still not be in the system. Not if some of these whining for television
politicians and their media enablers have their way.
Instead, what they'll do is they'll keep coming after the NRA and when another monster
slips through the cracks, the very cracks that they have enabled in the system, as the
records of prohibited persons remain out of the database, it will happen again. But here's
something we must be careful of as we go forward. We all have to be careful that this
doesn't become a runaway train. What if all of your medical records, perhaps your
conversations with your doctor, your prescription information, do we really want all that on
a government list and in the government database? Here's another one. A military vet,
comes -- goes to his local VA, comes home, goes to his or her local VA, and tells the doctor
they're having trouble sleeping at night or anyone who shares nightmares, nightmares with
a medical professional, they all become potential triggers that somebody, somewhere
could define as a mental health barrier to owning a firearm.
I even heard a television pundit recently suggesting that people seeking to buy a firearm
should be interviewed first. I mean, interviewed first? Who's going to conduct that
interview? And what will they ask? That's the challenge we as a free society face. How do
we create a step along the way called due process that protects the innocent law-abiding
people of this country from being falsely accused, politically abused and permanently
stigmatized unjustly?
Come on. Socialists oppose all of our most fundamental freedoms enshrined in the bill of
rights. They don't like free speech any more than they like the Second Amendment. They
like only limited speech, controlled speech, controlled by them, through safe speech zones,
where they can shame the outspoken, or riot to shut them up. If you still think we have full
First Amendment freedom in this country, try going right now out to Berkeley and speaking
out in favor of conservative causes or even the Second Amendment.
This growing socialist state dreams of manipulating schoolchildren, to squeeze and squeeze
information about their parents. They'll be asking your kids if mommy and daddy spank
them, or what mommy and daddy feeds them for dinner, they'll want to know what tv
shows you watch, what magazines, newspapers you read, and, oh, yes, do mommy and
daddy own a gun? And all that private information will be entered into that ultimate list
that cloud of data storage that couldn't care less about due process and constitutional
freedom and your privacy as an American citizen. And then it is just a short hop to the
systematic destruction of our most basic freedoms in this country. And you all know what
they are, but let me say them, family, faith, individual responsibility, and self-destiny, a free
market economy, patriotism, respect for our national flag and national anthem, personal
liberty, and justice for all.

Going back a decade or more, these essential freedoms and these essential values have
been increasingly and sadly ridiculed and disrespected and diminished in this country. And
it won't take long if we stay on the path we’re on to raise them completely. That’s the real
consequence of this new socialist wave in America. You know, I hear a lot of quiet in this
room, and I sense your anxiety. And you should be anxious, and you should be frightened. If
they seize power, if these so-called New European Socialists take over the House and the
Senate and God forbid, they get the White House again – our American freedoms could be
lost, and our country will be changed forever. And the first to go will be the Second
Amendment of the United States Constitution.
History proves it. Every time, in every nation in which this political disease rises to power,
its citizens are repressed, their freedoms are destroyed, and their firearms are banned and
confiscated. And it’s all backed in this country by the social engineering, and the billions of
people like George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and more – and gleefully
promoted by those who have risen to power in this so-called national news media and
seized control of social media to spread their propaganda. They don’t tell us news, and you
all know it, and people know it all over the United States, they say it to me every day. They
don’t tell us news – they tell us what we need to think. That’s the way it is these days.
On college campuses, The Communist Manifesto is one of the most frequently assigned
texts. Karl Marx is the most assigned economist. And there are now over 100 chapters of
young democratic socialists of America at many universities and students are even earning
academic credit for promoting socialist causes. In too many classrooms all over the United
States – and I know you think about this when you decide where you're gonna send your
kids to school, and your kids think about it, too – the United States Constitution is ignored,
United States history is perverted, and the Second Amendment freedom in this country is
despised.
You know, some people out there think the NRA should just stick to its Second Amendment
agenda, and not talk about all of our freedoms. But real freedom requires protection of all
of our rights, and the Second Amendment isn’t worth its own words in a country where all
of our other individual freedoms are destroyed. So I promise you this: the NRA will not only
speak out. We will speak out louder, and we will speak out stronger than ever before.
We will do it through NRA TV and our media operations, which we’ll expand to reach a
growing audience of Americans that are looking all over this country for the truth. They're
gonna do it with strong voices, like Dana Loesch, that you’ve just seen, Dan Bongino and
others who are engaging in new programming to make our message just as accessible as
NBC, The New York Times, and the rest of the so-called national news media.
Let’s be clear. We are never talking about an armed resistance against the socialist
corruption of our government. We are always talking about a resistance armed with the
United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights in our country. The genius of those
documents, the brilliance of America, of our country itself, is that all of our freedoms in this
country are for every single citizen. And there is no greater personal individual freedom
than the right to keep and bear arms, the right to protect yourself, and the right to survive.
It’s not bestowed by man but granted by God to all Americans as our American birthright.
So I call right now today on every citizen who loves this country and who treasures this
freedom, to stand and unflinchingly defend the Second Amendment, the one freedom that
protects us all in this country. And I refuse to leave this stage until I say, one more time,
79

Ella Nordberg
that we must immediately harden our schools. Every day. Every day, young children are
being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide-open soft targets for anyone bent on
mass murder. It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a
jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened targets in this
country, and evil must be confronted immediately with all necessary force to protect our
kids.
I said, five years ago, after that horrible tragedy in Newtown, and I wish, oh God, I wish
more had heeded my words. So lean in, listen to me now, and never forget these words: to
stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you.

Marco Rubio
Madam President, I join my colleague, the Senior Senator from Florida here today with a
broken heart – as I do most of the nation – would join us in the events of yesterday. And…
there indeed was a time in the history of our country, where, after an event such as this,
there was a mourning period that followed with a policy debate, but today, that time is
interrelated and intermixed. And I don’t blame them, I'm not upset about it, in fact, I think
there's just been too many of these now. And that’s why we continue to face this, we
continue to face these… I think it is a legitimate thing to say that, even as we mourn, we
have an obligation to ask ourselves: Is there something we could have done, or should do,
to ensure that we don’t see these things happen?
It’s cliché-ish to say, but I think it’s important to say that I'm a father of two young ladies
who happen to be in high school. I cannot imagine, but I can only envision what it would be
like, if one day, here, walking through the capital, I get a text or one of those news alerts
that says that there's been a shooting in the high school that they attend. And I can only
imagine how fearful it would be, when suddenly, those texts are not being answered, and
those calls are not being returned. I thought about that last night, and what it must feel like
to be one of those parents at the hotel, waiting for word, if you hadn’t heard from your
children in hours. Or how painful it must’ve been to those, whose job it was to go to these
parents and inform them, that their child, who they had sent off to school in the morning,
perhaps just weeks away from graduation, that their life had ended senselessly in an event
such as this. And because of what happened yesterday, and because it’s happened so often,
people from across the political spectrum are arguing “there’s gotta be something we can
do, we have to be able to do something”. And I agree with that sentiment, I understand it.
And I would add, though, that if we do something, it should be something that works. And
the struggle up to this point has been that most of the proposals that have been offered
would not have prevented, not just yesterday’s tragedy, but any of those in recent history.
And I'm gonna say now what I'm gonna really emphasize at the end – just because these
proposals would not have prevented these, does not mean that we therefore just raise our
hands and say therefore, there's nothing that we can do. It is a tough issue, because it is
part of the reason why it is so hard to prevent these, is because if someone decides that
they're gonna take it upon themselves to kill people – whether it’s a political assassination
of one person or the mass killing of many – if one person decides to do it and they're
committed to that task, it is a very difficult thing to stop. But that again does not mean that
we should not try to prevent as many of them as we can.
Perhaps the answer in how to prevent them begins by asking ourselves, “What do these
things have in common?”. They have two things in common. The first is that every single
one of them was premeditated and planned. None of these shootings were an act of
passion or someone got up in the morning and was upset and decided to do something out
of rage. They all involved careful planning and premeditation. They deliberately took steps
to get the guns, the weapons, the ammunition that they needed, in many cases they
carefully studied the outline of the target which they were going to go after. They
specifically planned soft targets, there's evidence of that in this case. And they planned to
81

Ella Nordberg
maximize the loss of life. They acquired the weapon that they needed, and they used tactics
that they needed to kill as many people as they could. By the way, because of that
premeditation and planning, is one of the reasons why these laws that have been proposed
wouldn’t have prevented them. Because when someone is planning and premeditating an
attack, they will figure out a way to evade those laws, or, quite frankly, to comply with
them in order to get around it. That may be an argument for new laws of a different kind,
but it’s what makes it hard, though not impossible. The second thing they have in common
is that almost all of these attacks were preceded by clear signs of what was to come. A
cursory review this morning of just a handful of the recent cases points that out.
We’re all familiar with the loss of life of over 20 people at a Texas church not long ago. This
is a case of a killer whose wife said that he tried to kill her, an individual who was arrested
and convicted for domestic violence, which was unfortunately never reported to the
background check system. An individual who escaped a mental health facility, who was
caught sneaking guns onto an air force base while on active duty, who was discharged from
the military for bad conduct, who had social media posts that bragged about buying dogs to
shoot them and… actually expressed admiration for the South Carolina killer in that church
killing a few years ago, an individual who was actually charged with animal mistreatment
just a few years earlier. In Sandy Hook, we know that the killer had a spreadsheet with
details of the previous school shootings. It was also an individual whose mental state was
rapidly deteriorating to the point where they spoke to no one but his mother, who he
ultimately killed before carrying out the horrific massacre. But someone who was isolated
in their room all day, largely playing video games. And the Polz attack, which was
precipitated and inspired by an adherence to a jihadist ideology, as Senator Nelson’s
already pointed out, this individual, not once, but twice, had been on the radar screen of
the FBI and both times, had been cleared. They interviewed him, they asked him questions
– he didn’t meet the standard for staying on the list, and he came off.
We are still learning facts about yesterday’s killer. Unlike these others, we may learn more,
because he was apprehended alive, and authorities will have an opportunity to question
him. And that will continue. But here’s what we know – we know that he was expelled from
school for behavior that the administrators thought was dangerous. We know that, from
press accounts now, both teachers and students did not act surprised that he was the
assailant, in fact, many of them said that there was a running joke – obviously not a joke
anymore – that one day, he would do something like this. We know that the media and
others have discovered social media posts, which are, in hindsight, deeply disturbing, as
they point to glorification of gun violence and murder and… animal cruelty, even,
apparently. We saw reports this morning of a post on YouTube a year ago, where he posted
that he wanted to be a school shooter – this was alerted to the FBI. Who have followed up,
by the way, in an interview with that person who alerted them.
They all have this premeditation in common, and we sit here in hindsight and see all of
these little points and say, “taken together, those are warning signs”. The problem is,
they're not taken together, because the people who might have known about him being
expelled may not have known about the social media posts, and the people who knew
about the social media posts may not have known about what he wrote on YouTube, and
82

Ella Nordberg
the people who knew about the YouTube may not have known about the fact that the
police have been called several times for different reasons, and so forth.
And so, hence the challenge for why it’s so hard to find something that works, and there
are a lot of proposals. And I’ll share the ones – ‘cause I've heard them before and I hear
them today, and I'm not diminishing them. I don’t want this to be taken as “because it
won’t work, I don’t even wanna hear your argument” – I understand, I really do. You read in
the newspaper that they used a certain kind of gun, and therefore, let’s make it harder to
get those kinds of guns. I don’t have some sort of de facto religious objection to that, or
some ideological commitment to that, per se – there's all kinds of guns that are outlawed
and weaponry that’s outlawed and/or special category. The problem is, we did that once,
and it didn’t work for a lot of reasons – one of them is, there's already millions of these in
the street. And those things, they last a hundred years. And so, you could pass a law that
makes it hard to get this kind of gun in a new condition. But you're gonna struggle to keep it
out of the hands of someone who’s decided that’s what they want to use, because there's
so many of them out there already, they would be grandfathered in.
You can do a background check. The truth is, in almost all these cases I cited, the individual
either erroneously passed the background check, or would have passed it, or did. Again,
even if they couldn’t pass the background check, then they could buy them the way MS13
does, and other gangs, and other street elements do: from the black market. Again, not
because we shouldn’t have the background check, I'm just trying to be clear and honest
here – someone’s decided, “I'm going to commit this crime”, they’ll find a way to get the
gun to do it. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a law that makes it harder, it just
means, understand, to be honest, it isn’t going to stop this from happening. You could still
pass the law, per se, but… you're still gonna have these horrible attacks.
And that’s why, I do think, that, in some circles, it isn’t fair or right to create this impression
that, somehow, this attack happened yesterday because there's some law out there that
we could have passed to prevent it. For if there was such a law, that could have prevented
yesterday, I think a lot of people would have supported it. But I also want to be honest to
people who share my point of view on these issues. I think it’s also wrong to say that
there's nothing we can do. And I would admit that perhaps, even I, in the past, in the way
I've addressed this issue or spoken about it, may have come off as dismissive with the
argument that, since none of these laws would have worked, there's just nothing we can do
and we’ll just have to deal with it. Just because I don’t have a quick or easy answer for how
to prevent these, doesn’t mean that we don’t have an obligation to try and find one. And by
finding one, I don’t mean a quick and easy answer. I mean an answer that would work.
When I took office here, I swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Every
element of it. I didn’t write the Constitution, but I agree with it and I support it. The Second
Amendment’s in the Constitution. And you can debate what the outlines of the Second
Amendment are, how far it goes, but it’s in there. And I happen to support it. And I happen
to oftentimes point to the Second Amendment and say, “it’s the second amendment, right
after free speech – that tells you how important it was to those who wrote those words”. I
still believe every bit of that. But I also recognize that, if it’s fair to say that the Second
83

Ella Nordberg
Amendment is so important – and I want to reiterate, it is, because of how high up it is in
the ranking from first to second, it’s the second one – then I have to recognize that there's
a part of the Constitution that was written even before the Second Amendment. And it’s
the preamble. And that preamble lays out why we have a constitution, and ultimately, why
we have a government. And in it, it says that two of the reasons why we have a
government, and therefore two of the reasons why we have a senate, is to ensure domestic
tranquility and to promote the general welfare. And these school shootings and mass
shootings and murders that we are seeing now at an accelerated pace – these things are, by
definition, a threat to our domestic tranquility and a threat to our general welfare.
The murder of children in schools, the murder of moviegoers, the murder of people at a
church, the murder of people at a dance club on Saturday night – these are all places where
we should be enjoying the general welfare and the domestic tranquility. And so, even as we
recognize that the Second Amendment gives Americans the right to bear arms and to
protect themselves – a right that I strongly support and will continue to support – we must
also recognize that the same constitution places upon this government an obligation to
ensure domestic tranquility and promote general welfare. And we must confront the fact,
that over the last 20 years, these attacks have accelerated, and we must recognize the
evidence that they are not isolated from one another, they are building upon one another.
We must recognize the scary reality, that even as a nation mourn and parents grieve, it is a
high probability, if not certainty, that somewhere in America right now, some equally
troubled and deranged, violent individual is reading and watching coverage of this attack
and gaining from it, not sorrow, but inspiration. That even as we speak here now, even as
we stand here in mourning, and even as the days go by, there are probably some people
out there who are going to try to do this because of what happened yesterday. That is a
frightening thought, but it is a reality. And it challenges us to find an answer to a very
difficult issue. How do we take all of these bits and pieces of information out there? How do
we, in this society, confront someone, who does things that, in another era, we would say
“well, they're just a strange person”? “They’re just weird”? “They’re just going through a
phase”? We can’t do it anymore. There is no longer such a thing as just an innocent posting
online that you just look at and say, “well, that’s just them, they're strange, they don’t
mean anything by it, they're harmless”. We cannot assume that anymore. None of us. How
do we create a system where all of these disconnected pieces and bits of data can
somehow be tied together so that, whenever it was that this killer got a hold of these
weapons and proceeded to perform, conducting these attacks, someone would say, “Hold
on a second – this person is the person who got expelled from school who had these social
media posts saying he wanted to be a school shooter, whose mother passed away in
November, who is now living isolated, who has students of all suspected him of being a
person who could one day be violent…” How do you take these bits and pieces of
information and turn them into a usable source of data that perhaps prevents the
acquisition of a weapon or, preferably, intervenes in that person’s life before they carry this
out? If anyone here tells you that they have that one figured out, they're not being honest.
This is hard, but we need to do it. We need to somehow figure it out. Because it goes to the
very core of why exist to begin with. There is no greater obligation of our government than
to keep our people safe – from threats both foreign and domestic. And we must
84

Ella Nordberg
acknowledge that this is a threat, that for whatever reason, we now live in a society where
someone, at 19 years of age, in the freest and the most prosperous nation in all of human
history, has decided to take it upon themselves to take the lives of 17 individuals and
severely injure 14 others, and actually, probably try to kill even more.
What is happening in our country, in our culture, in our society? And if there is something
to be done without laws, we should do that, too. I'm not saying don’t focus on the gun part,
but we also have to focus on the violence part. For to talk about gun violence requires to
talk about both. And the violence part is the one that goes well beyond an easy government
solution and entails all different aspects of modern life that we are still grappling with. And
so, I hope that we can start to figure it out. I haven’t had the time, frankly, in less than 18
hours, to bring to the floor a proposal for how we move forward or what the form would be
for this conversation to even begin, but I know that we can no longer just chalk it up to
isolated instances. Because it’s happened too often, and sadly, I believe, will happen again.
So we confront it, try to solve it. And I hope that we will, and I believe that we can. I believe
that we must. For, as I said at the outset, and I’ll say in conclusion, it goes to the core of
why we even exist to begin with: keeping our people safe – no matter how new, how
different, or how unique the threat may be. Madam President, I yield the floor.
