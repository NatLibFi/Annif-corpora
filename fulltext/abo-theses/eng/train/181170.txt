ABSTRACT
Waste heat is a commonly used term for such heat energy that is not utilized in the
process but dissipates to the environment unused. Waste heat is a by-product which
can be found in various streams exiting the process, and it can be categorized according
to its temperature into three categories: temperature below 50 °C, temperature between
50…100 °C and temperature above 100 °C.
Utilization of waste heat is a means to improve the energy efficiency of a process or a
plant. Actions towards improving energy efficiency are incorporated to strategies and
legislation on the national and international level as actions to increase sustainability
and reduce CO2 and other emissions are crucial in ensuring a functional and viable
society and environment in the future.
The theoretical, technical and economic potentials of waste heat sources must be
evaluated when its utilization is contemplated. Theoretical potential describes the
physical properties of the waste heat source and its possible limitations, technical
potential determines the technologies available for heat recovery, and economic
potential evaluates the investment’s economic feasibility.
The heating and cooling demands as well as minimal utility demands for a process can
systematically be analysed with Pinch Analysis. This analysis data can be utilized to
determine the potentials for heat recovery through process integration as well as to
evaluate the how energy efficiently the process is currently being operated.

II

According to the Laws of Thermodynamics, heat energy is interconvertible and energy
will spontaneously flow between substances from a higher temperature to a lower one.
These principled must be taken into account when the potentials for waste heat
recovery are identified and suitable techniques for heat recovery are contemplated.
Heat transfer between the waste heat source and a heat sink can be carried out in the
same temperature with passive or by increasing the temperature or transforming heat
energy to electric energy with active means. Passive means include heat transfer
through heat exchangers and storage of heat. Active means include, for example, heat
pumps and Organic Rankine Cycle.
A case study for the process of Finnfeeds Finland Co Naantali factory was carried out
in this survey, in order to identify and evaluate the waste heat sources available in their
operation and to contemplate on potentials for waste heat utilization. The process was
analysed with Pinch Analysis and based on this analysis, there is a limited potential
for waste heat recovery without increasing the temperature as the temperature of most
of the identified waste heat sources remains relatively low. Several preliminary
investment proposals were sketched to demonstrate the potentials for waste heat
utilization both internally and externally.

Keywords: energy efficiency, heat exchanger, heat pump, heat storage, heat transfer,
Organic Rankine Cycle, Pinch Analysis, waste heat, waste heat recovery

1 INTRODUCTION
In 2019, the Finnish industry sector used 520 PJ (appr. 144 TWh) worth of energy
(Tilastokeskus, 2020). It has been estimated that inside the industry sector, the
technical potential of energy found in waste heat sources is from 6 to 23 TWh annually,
most of which can be found in the chemistry and metal industry sectors. This is a very
significant amount of heat energy that could be utilized in many applications (Gynther
et al., 2019).
Every time mechanical work is executed with some equipment or in some process, it
is inevitable that the primary energy that is fed into the machine cannot fully be
utilized. This means that energy losses are formed, for example, via radiation of heat
or as convection of heat to a process fluid. Figure 1 illustrates the way energy is utilized
in a process and how the unused energy dissipates from it. Even though it is not the
purpose of the process to create heat losses, these can act as sources for so called waste
heat and contain a very considerable amount of usable heat energy (Brückner et al.,
2015).

Figure 1 Illustration of energy flowing in a process (Bendig et al., 2013).

2

Waste heat is a commonly used term with multiple definitions. Most literature
references and legislative parties review waste heat simply as heat energy that is
dissipated to the surroundings. This definition is solely based on the examination of
energy balances and the first law of thermodynamics (the Law of Conservation of
Energy; “the total energy of a system and its surroundings is preserved” (Perry et al.,
1997a)) and does not take into consideration neither the temperature nor the
possibilities of utilization for this energy source (Bendig et al., 2013).
A distinctive feature in the waste heat sources found in process industry is the fact that
the heat that is bound in these waste streams is generated as a side product, and its
production is dependent on how the process is controlled and in which stage the
process currently is. For example, the process can require a certain temperature to
which the process fluids are heated up into, or the heat energy can be introduced to the
process by exothermal reactions or mechanical work. If this heat energy is not
recovered after processing, the temperature will slowly decrease via dissipation of heat
energy to the environment or it will leave the process bound into some waste stream
(Rämä et al., 2020, Brückner et al., 2015).
Waste heat can be bound into different types of streams leaving the industrial facility,
such as waste waters, cooling waters, exhaust steams, process and flue gases, exhaust
gases from driers or in condensates from mechanical cooling. These waste heat sources
can be categorized according to their temperature levels into the following categories
(Gynther et al., 2019):
-

-

-

Temperature below 50 °C
- for example, cooling waters, condensate from mechanical cooling,
exhaust air flows from processes
Temperature between 50 °C and 100 °C
- for example, cooling waters, relief gases, cooling of oil lubricated
compressors
Temperature above 100 °C
- for example, flue gases, hot exhaust gases from processes

Utilization of these waste heat sources inside the facility in its processes or for heating
up the properties, or by selling the heat energy outside of the facility to external actors

3

is highly beneficial in terms of improving the total energy efficiency of the plant.
According to IEA Scenario 450, over 50% of reduction of CO2 emissions in the
atmosphere is accomplished with actions related to energy efficiency. This topic has
been widely researched, and there is also a great deal of political and economic parties
that are pressurising industries to improve their actions regarding energy efficiency,
which speaks for the importance of energy efficiency in our society and industry
(Bendig et al., 2013).
A means of improving energy efficiency, that is to increase the value of used energy
per unit, is to utilize waste heat energy to produce additional actions (Bendig et al.,
2013). Ensuring energy efficient operation provides good premises for a competitive,
sustainable and environmentally friendly production process, which are all basic
principles for a modern industry. Energy efficiency can be improved by implementing
new energy efficient technologies or equipment, by modifying existing ones and
implementing system integration to reduce waste heat generation, or by implementing
techniques or equipment for recovery and reutilization of waste heat. All of these
means to improve energy efficiency will require effective techniques to be developed
through scientific and technological progress and will naturally require possibly large
capital investments to be carried out before implementation (Semkov et al., 2014).
The energy content in waste streams is, unfortunately, usually not fully available for
utilization and, thus, when planning to utilize heat energy collected from a waste
stream, its technical and economic potential needs to be evaluated in order to determine
how much of the theoretical potential actually could be utilized. The theoretical
potential of waste heat describes the physical properties and limitations of the source:
for efficient utilization, the heat energy should be bound into a medium in a
temperature above ambient temperature. Due to such limitations, the heat energy that
is radiating from hot equipment surfaces to the surroundings is traditionally poorly
available to be utilized, despite its large quantities. The technical potential determines
how well the heat energy can be recovered, what technology should be used in the
recovery and also where the recovered heat energy can be utilized. In addition to the
theoretical and technical potential, an economic potential should also be determined
for each waste heat source in order to evaluate the economic feasibility of the
investment (Brückner et al., 2015).

4

At least the following properties should be studied from each waste heat source when
its utilization is contemplated (Gynther et al., 2019, Motiva, 2014):
-

Temperature level
Power and energy (stability and fluctuation)
Medium of waste heat stream and its state
Chemical properties of the medium
Purity of the medium
Demand of heat energy
How heat recovery will affect the main process

When evaluating the possible ways to utilize waste heat, possible applications can be
evaluated in a recommended order, as demonstrated in Figure 2. Following this
hierarchical order, the first step is to evaluate possible improvements in energy
utilization and efficiency internally, before consideration of distributing the heat
energy to external parties. By decreasing the consumption of primary energy, the
energy costs of the facility naturally decrease, as do the emissions of the plant. In case
waste heat energy is sold to external parties, in addition to additional revenue, new
business opportunities are created (Gynther et al., 2019).

• Improving internal energy use and energy efficiency in order to decrease the need
for primary energy and the production of waste heat

• Utilization of waste heat internally
• Primarily in the same process where the waste heat is produced in
• Secondarily in other processes within the same production line

• Selling waste heat to external parties within the same industrial area

• Utilization of waste heat in district heating

Figure 2 Recommended order to evaluation of waste heat utilization (Gynther et al., 2019).

5

Waste heat energy can be utilized as such by recirculating it as secondary heat energy
to a new utilization point, in heat exchangers to, for example, dry or pre-heat the raw
materials or fuels of processes. It can also be used in heating systems of internal
properties. If waste heat is utilized in district heating, it is often necessary to increase
the temperature of the stream with a heat pump. Increase of waste heat stream
temperature can naturally be a requirement in internal usage as heat source for
processes as well (Motiva, 2014). Some common technologies that are applied to heat
recovery and possible temperature increase of the waste heat are presented in Chapter
2.

1.1 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WASTE HEAT IN LEGISLATION AND POLITICS
All companies will have to comply on national and international legislation; for
example, in Finland, the national legislation is enacted with reference to that of the
European Union. In addition to legislation and directives, these international
stakeholders guide their member countries with strategies and visions. For example,
the United Nations has published an agenda with multiple goals to ensure sustainable
development in 2015, and according to Goal 7.3 in this Agenda, the global rate of
improvement in energy efficiency shall be doubled by 2030 (the United Nations,
2015).
On the legislative side, the EU’s Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and Directive for
Renewable Energy (RED2) regulate the energy efficiency actions and utilization of
renewable energy sources inside the European Union. Contrary to the definition for
waste heat given in the introduction in this thesis, RED2 defines waste heat or waste
cold only as such waste heat that is utilized in a district heating or cooling network.
According to this definition, the industrial plant producing the waste heat has already
executed all possible energy efficiency actions to minimize the production of waste
heat. Additionally, this definition emphasizes the characteristics of waste heat being a
by-product of the process, meaning that it is not a target for the process or plant to
produce waste heat (Rämä et al., 2020).

6

The Energy Efficiency Directive obliges all EU member states to set an indicative
energy efficiency target level based on either the consumption of primary or final
energy, the savings of primary or final energy, or energy intensity. This target level is
reported to the union in a report including additionally the information on the absolute
level of primary and final energy use with its calculation principles and the remaining
cost-effective energy saving potential, GDP development with forecasts, changes in
energy imports and exports, developments in renewable energy sources, nuclear
power, carbon capture and storage, and early actions. EU member states shall increase
their energy efficiency actions annually by 0.8% of final energy consumption
(1.1.2021-31.12.2030) (Directive 2012/27/EU).
Another way for the European Union to guide its member states towards cleaner and
more efficient energy solutions is the European Green Deal strategy. The purpose of
this strategy is to overcome the challenges caused to the world by climate change and
environmental degradation by transforming the EU into a modern economy with
resource efficiency and competitiveness with no net emissions of greenhouse gases
(by 2050), where economic growth would not be dependent on resource use, and where
no persons or places would be left behind. In other words, the European Union is
aiming towards a sustainable economy, and this vision will be achieved with a
multifaceted plan focusing on the necessary investments and available financial tools
for harnessing circular economy principles, restoring biodiversity, and decreasing
pollution. The way to reach the targets set by the Green Deal differs for various sectors
in the economy, but practical examples include decarbonization of the energy sector
and implementing environmentally-friendly technologies to the industry sector (the
European Commission, 2021).
Besides decarbonization of the energy sector, other modifications are additionally
required in order to modify the current energy systems from their linear operation
model towards a circular one, as is illustrated in Figure 3. Utilization of waste heat
energy is one of the three main characteristics of the reform of energy systems into an
Integrated EU Energy System, alongside making it cleaner in terms of fuel and power.
Reduction of currently wasted resources is needed, and this applies also to the resource
of heat energy in the form of waste heat. Primarily, the formation of waste heat energy

7

must be reduced by promoting energy efficiency, and secondly, the reuse of waste heat
utilization in the industry should be encouraged (the European Commission, 2020).

Figure 3 EU Green Deal Energy Integration principles for transforming energy systems into a
more sustainable direction (the European Commission, 2020).

At the national level, these energy efficiency actions are steered to the industrial level
with legislation and through various benefits or constraints. The Finnish Energy
Efficiency Act (1429/2014) contains directions for actions concerning energy
efficiency and for investigating the utilization of waste heat in district heating under
certain circumstances (Energiatehokkuuslaki (1429/2014)), which means that waste
heat is defined similarly in Finnish legislation as in the EU’s RED2.
Taxation is an efficient tool for the government to guide the private sector towards the
government’s goal for a carbon neutral Finland by 2035 (Government
Communications Department, 2020). For example, the taxes on electricity are divided
into two categories, the second one of which is meant for companies in certain
industries, including the manufacturing industry. Mainly companies obliged to pay
electricity taxes are included in the first tax category, and these companies include the
companies who are producing and distributing electricity (Vero, 2021).

8

The tax prices for each tax category are the following, including 24% VAT and
strategic stockpile fee (Caruna, 2021):
-

Tax category 1: 2.79372 c/kWh
Tax category 2: 0.07812 c/kWh

The manufacturing industry will pay the electricity tax according to the second tax
category for all electricity consumption in their production and its support functions,
and also in the cases of internal heat production in an electricity-consuming heating
plant, as long as the heat is consumed internally. If the company is producing
electricity, no taxes or strategic stockpile fee will need to be paid for it, regardless of
whether the electricity is consumed internally or sold to external parties (Vero, 2021).
To encourage the manufacturing industry to invest in technologies which utilize
electricity (from renewable sources) instead of fossil fuels (Government
Communications Department, 2020), the Finnish government has decided to lower the
tax category 2 in steps to the EU’s minimal level of 0.05 c/kWh (Parkkonen et al.,
2020). This decrease in the tax price is conducted in steps as of 2021, and it is also
expected to help improve the competitiveness of Finnish industrial companies among
their EU rivals (Government Communications Department, 2020). In addition to the
decrease of tax category 2, the Government has also decided to move industrial heat
pumps to this tax category as of 2021, but unfortunately, this currently applies only to
such heat pumps that are producing heat for district heating (the European
Commission, 2021).
As energy efficiency and the utilization of waste heat are highly promoted in both
international and national strategies and legislation, there are also ways to apply for
funding to aid companies fulfil their energy efficiency targets with new investments.
For example, Business Finland, the Finnish government’s organization for funding of
innovations (Business Finland, 2021b), is one stakeholder that grants aids for
investments in the form of “Energy Aid” to companies that are carrying out energy
efficiency or energy savings investments, as long as these investments are not executed
because of fulfilling compulsory environmental obligations or they are not compulsory

9

energy audits stated in the Energy Efficiency Act (1429/2014) (Business Finland,
2021a).

1.2 METHODOLOGIES FOR ANALYSING WASTE HEAT UTILIZATION
In order to find the opportunities for improving cost-efficiently the energy efficiency
of a process through the utilization of waste heat, systematic evaluation is required and
the tools or methodologies that can be utilized for this purpose can be, for example,
System Integration, Heat Exchanger Networks (HEN), Pinch Analysis, and Exergy
Analysis (Semkov et al., 2014). Out of these options, Pinch Analysis has been applied
in this thesis for a case study survey.

1.2.1

PINCH ANALYSIS

Regarding engineering of chemical processes, the two types of engineering problems
are unit operation design and total system design. Pinch Analysis is a systematic tool
that can be used to address the total system design problem in order to create and
optimize the process flowsheet and simultaneously minimize energy consumption. It
was created in the 1970’s in the ETH Zurich and Leeds University and has been
developed ever since with rapid development in the early years with combined
operation of ICI company-wide research and application studies. It has been widely
used both in projects designing new plants and in projects modifying existing plant
structures, in traditional chemistry industry such as oil refining or bulk chemical
production, and also outside of these common examples. Pinch Analysis can be used
as a tool for projects tackling problems with heat recovery, process condition changes,
operability improvements, or effective use of utility systems. It is a key contributor to
process development and design overall strategy, or process synthesis, which can be
described with an onion diagram in Figure 4 (Kemp, 2007a).

10

Figure 4 Onion diagram describing the hierarchical nature of process synthesis (Kemp, 2007a).

A design process has to proceed “inside out”, starting from the chemical reaction
occurring, determining how reaction products can be separated and only then is it
possible to determine what kind of heat energy exchange is required in the process.
The studied process entity or unit operation is simplified into a flow scheme focusing
only on what kind of heating or cooling duties are required in the various streams. The
analysis uses the basic principles of thermodynamics in a practical way to study
eventually the whole process operation, while the potentials of energy saving or other
process benefits are uncovered from raw data (Kemp, 2007a).
Pinch Analysis begins by recognizing and choosing all streams in need of temperature
change without a simultaneous composition change, and dividing these into the ones
that require cooling and the ones that require heating. Their initial and final
temperatures are determined, as well as the heat flow or enthalpy (heat content Q [kW])
in each stream as a function of each substance’s specific heat capacity and mass
flowrate. This necessary information can be visualized as a temperature-heat content
diagram, as shown in Figure 6 (Kemp, 2007b).
This diagram visualizes the change in the enthalpy of the stream when temperature
changes from supply temperature Ts to target temperature Tt:
𝑇

𝑄 = ∫𝑇 𝑇 𝑐𝑝 𝑑𝑇 = 𝑐𝑝 (𝑇𝑇 − 𝑇𝑆 ) = ∆𝐻
𝑆

(1)

11

𝑑𝑇
𝑑𝑄

=

𝑐𝑝

,

(2)

where Q = heat flow [kW], cp = specific heat capacity [kJ/kgK], dT = change in
temperature [K], and ΔH = change in enthalpy [kW] (Kemp, 2007b).
As the change in enthalpy is the driving factor in this assessment instead of the absolute
value of enthalpy, each stream can be drawn anywhere on the enthalpy axis as long as
the slope as well as supply and target temperatures remain the same. The potentials for
heat exchange can be interpreted directly from this figure, keeping in mind the fact
that heat energy will be transferred between the streams as long as the difference in
temperatures remains positive (hot stream temperature > cold stream temperature).
This type of visualization can be utilized when simultaneously assessing all relevant
process streams (Kemp, 2007b).
To visualize all hot or cold streams with two separate lines, the heat contents and target
temperatures of all of them must be taken into account. Based on how many of the
streams are viable within a given temperature range, the total heat content in that range
is calculated by adding together all the heat contents of each individual stream. This
procedure is illustrated in Figure 5, where (a) describes each individual hot stream and
its temperature ranges, and (b) illustrates the temperature range of a Composite Curve
and how the enthalpy changes throughout the largest and smallest temperature (Kemp,
2007b).

Figure 5 Illustration of how a Composite Curve is formed (Kemp, 2007b).

12

When the Composite Curves of both hot and cold streams are depicted in the same
temperature-heat content curve, as shown in Figure 6, it is possible to determine a
Pinch point and the potentials for heat exchange between these streams as well as
minimum required amounts of utilities. The overlap of the hot and the cold Composite
Curve illustrates how much heat energy could be recovered from the process, and the
parts of the Composite Curves exceeding or falling under this overlap represent the
minimum amount of required cooling or heating utilities, respectively. To be able to
minimize the utilization of utilities for cooling or heating of process streams, the Pinch
point or ΔTmin between the hot and the cold Composite Curve must be determined so
that the two curves will not overlap and the value for ΔTmin remains positive and larger
than zero at all times. The utility utilization of the process can be optimized to a
minimal level based on the information provided by Pinch Analysis (Kemp, 2007b).

Figure 6 An example of a temperature-heat content diagram for multiple streams. The dotted
line contains the hot streams and the continuous line contains the cold streams. The potentials
for heat recovery as well as minimum utility needs can be read from the figure (Kemp, 2007b).

In order to set energy targets from the Composite Curves, the two curves must be
illustrated in relation to one another with so called shifted temperatures. In all
temperature intervals, the temperatures are modified or shifted ½ΔTmin below or above
the original temperatures, depending on whether the stream is a hot or a cold stream.
This process is illustrated in Figure 7 (Kemp, 2007b).

13

For any temperature interval i, there will be a net surplus or deficit of heat energy based
on the enthalpy balance (Kemp, 2007b):
∆𝐻𝑖 = (𝑆𝑖 − 𝑆𝑖+1 )(∑ 𝐶𝑃𝐻 − ∑ 𝐶𝑃𝐶 )𝑖 ,

(3)

where S = shifted temperature in [°C], and CP = ṁ [kg/s] ∙ cp [kJ/kgK].
After calculating the enthalpy balances for each temperature interval, according to Ian
Kemp in his book “Pinch Analysis and Process Integration” (Kemp, 2007b) it is
assumed that “any heat available in interval i is hot enough to supply any duty in
interval i+1”. If the heat is not utilized in a certain interval, or there is a surplus of heat
from a certain interval, it can be cascaded into the next interval and utilized there. By
studying the enthalpy balances and heat utilization, or how heat cascades through the
system, the minimum heat added by cold and hot utilities can be determined. This
study operation can also be utilized to determine the total amount of heat recovered by
heat exchange by adding together the heat loads for the hot and cold streams and
subtracting the hot and cold utility target heat values from them (Kemp, 2007b).

Figure 7 Modifying a Composite Curve into a Shifted Composite Curve and further into a
Grand Composite Curve. The Grand Composite Curve illustrates the net heat flow in any given
shifted temperature in relation to the Pinch point (Grip et al., 2013).

14

The Composite Curves can be re-plotted with the shifted temperatures to find out a
minimum amount for net heat inflow in any given temperature interval, and this can
be plotted against the shifted temperatures to form the Grand Composite Curves as
shown in Figure 7. The GCC can be utilized to visualize how much heating or cooling
is required at each temperature: in the Pinch point, this net heat load is equal to zero
(Kemp, 2007b).
The Pinch point can be utilized with three main rules, when the required heating and
cooling energies are designed for a system:
-

Heat should not be transferred across the Pinch point
Cold utilities should not be utilized above the Pinch point
Hot utilities should not be utilized below the Pinch point (Kemp, 2007b).

Above the Pinch point, all the streams requiring cooling should be cooled through
process integration with the streams that require heating, and vice versa for the streams
below the Pinch point. If these rules are not followed, it is not possible to accomplish
a heat exchange system with minimal external energy from hot and cold utilities: for
example, when a cold utility is utilized above the Pinch point, this results in utilizing
additional hot utilities also (Kemp, 2007b).

2 THE TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS FOR HEAT RECOVERY
When identifying suitable sinks for waste heat utilization, the first and second laws of
thermodynamics must be kept in mind. The first law of thermodynamics states that the
internal energy of a system is conserved, and that energy in the form of work or heat
are interconvertible. The second law of thermodynamics states that heat will always
flow from hot to cold temperature (Luscombe, 2018). These are the same principles
that are applied with other types of applications or unit operations involved in heat
transfer, and finding pairs of flows with suitable heat flow as well as initial and target
temperatures is the target when examining the potentials of waste heat recovery.

15

The heat flow provided by the waste heat source or required by the heat sink can be
calculated with the equation (Abedin et al., 2011):
𝑄̇ = 𝑚̇𝑐𝑝 ∆𝑇,

(4)

where Q̇ = heat flow [kW], ṁ = mass flow [kg/s], cp = specific heat capacity [kJ/kgK],
and ΔT = change in temperature [K].
There are multiple technologies available for heat recovery of waste heat, and they can
be categorized into passive and active means of heat recovery. Passive technologies
utilize the heat energy in the same or decreased temperature as in the heat source,
whereas active technologies increase the temperature level or convert heat energy into
a different form of energy, such as electrical energy. Figure 8 presents different
commonly used heat recovery technologies, from which by far the most popular
technologies in addition to traditional heat exchangers are different heat pumps and
Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which is used to convert heat energy into electric
energy (Brückner et al., 2015).

al., 2015).

The temperature level and quantity of the waste stream containing the waste heat
energy play an immensely large role when a suitable technique for heat recovery is
chosen. If the waste heat source is in a low temperature level, the quantity of the flow
it is bound into needs to be sufficiently large and the utilization application in which
the heat energy will be utilized, will need to be simultaneously operational, as heat
energy in low temperature is not reasonable to store. The largest benefits and economic
savings are provided by high temperature level waste heat sources, and a broader range
of technologies for heat recovery is applicable with them (Woolnough, 2011).

guideline waste heat source temperatures TS as well as their advantages and
disadvantages.

2.1 PASSIVE MEANS FOR WASTE HEAT ENERGY UTILIZATION
Passive means for waste heat recovery usually require the heat energy to be transferred
directly from the heat source to the heat sink. All of the three means of heat transfer,

18

conduction, convection, and radiation (Perry et al., 1997b) need to be considered when
assessing the possibilities and applications for heat recovery.

2.1.1

HEAT EXCHANGERS

Heat exchangers are vastly utilized in all fields of technology, and their operation
principle complies with the same principles regardless of the heat energy source being
originated from waste heat energy. For example, there is a long tradition in different
power or boiler plants for the utilization of an abundant source of waste heat energy in
the flue gases to heat up water or fuel or pre-heat the combustion air (Jouhara et al.,
2018).
Utilization of waste heat energy as a direct heat energy source with a heat exchanger
requires excellent predictability of the availability of the amount of energy, as this
information is required to size the heat exchanger. The amount and temperature of the
waste heat stream must be known in order to realistically and optimally size the
equipment and enable efficient transition of heat energy from the source to the sink.
The properties of the fluids in both sides of the heat exchanger are also crucial initial
data for heat exchanger design, especially if evaporation or condensation is expected
to occur in the heat transfer process (Nitsche et al., 2016).
Heat recovery from waste heat with heat exchangers can be utilized, for example, for
heating of properties through a central heating system or through process integration,
where the waste heat source is coupled with a heat exchanger directly to another
process flow.

2.1.2

HEAT ENERGY STORAGES

Heat storages are used to temporarily store heat energy either by cooling down or
warming up the storage material. Different kinds of techniques and applications exist,
and the choice of the applicable type of technology to each subject must be chosen
depending on the costs for storage, the temperatures of both the heat energy source

19

and sink, storage capacity, heat losses and available space for storage (Abedin et al.,
2011).
Heat storage technologies can be divided into sensible heat storage or latent heat
storage and, additionally, to thermochemical heat storage. In sensible heat storage, the
heat energy is stored by altering the temperature of the storage material, whereas a
latent heat storage utilizes state change of substance to store the energy, for example,
by freezing down water into ice. Because the state change of a substance requires
significantly larger amounts of energy compared to just increasing the temperature in
the same state of the substance, latent heat storages can be smaller in size than sensible
heat storages. In other words, a latent heat storage is capable of storing a larger amount
of energy into a smaller volume of storage material compared to a sensible heat
storage. The size of a sensible heat storage can be decreased by turning it into a
thermochemical sensible heat storage, which utilizes chemical reactions under the
influence of heat energy. However, this storage type is not yet commercially very well
available (Abedin et al., 2011).
Guideline values can be defined to different types of heat storage technologies to
describe how much energy per volume it is possible to store with a particular
application. Examples of such values for a sensible heat storage with a water tank is
0.2 GJ/m3, for latent heat storage 0.3…0.5 GJ/m3, and for thermochemical storage
0.5…3 GJ/m3 (Abedin et al., 2011).
Sensible heat storage uses the heat energy source to cool down or heat up a solid or
liquid storage material, such as water, oil, stone, concrete, or sand. The stored heat
energy Q [kW] is calculated as a product of storage material mass m [kg], specific heat
capacity cp [kJ/kgK] and temperature change ΔT [K], as shown with the following
equation (Abedin et al., 2011):
𝑄 = 𝑚𝑐𝑝 ∆𝑇

(5)

In a latent heat storage, the state of the storage material is changed in a fixed
temperature, and the heat energy Q [kW] stored by this state change can be determined

20

by the mass m [kg] and latent heat capacity L [kJ/kg] of the storage material (Abedin
et al., 2011):
𝑄 = 𝑚𝐿

(6)

Different materials utilized in a latent heat storage include, for example, water,
paraffins and eutectic salts, and these materials are typically available for operation in
a relatively narrow temperature range. The state changes (evaporation, melting, and
crystallization) are all dependent on the specific heat capacity of each substance, and
the change in enthalpy is extremely large when state change occurs, which enables a
larger amount of energy to be stored in a certain volume by using latent heat storage
rather than a sensible heat storage (Abedin et al., 2011).
In a thermochemical heat storage, the heat energy is stored via chemical decomposition
of storage material and it is released in an opposite reaction, when the decomposition
products are reformed into the original storage material. Thermochemical heat storage
has the largest energy density out of these three types of heat storage technologies,
which means that it is capable of storing the most heat energy into the same storage
volume. Thermochemical heat storage is particularly suitable for long-term heat
storage, as it has almost non-existent heat losses, and the storage is usually operated in
ambient temperature (Abedin et al., 2011).

Figure 9 Storage cycle in a thermochemical heat storage (Abedin et al., 2011).

21

Thermochemical heat storage is based on a three-phased cycle, as illustrated in Figure
9. The first phase is an endothermic reaction which charges up the storage via
absorption of heat energy into storage material causing it to decompose into
decomposition products. These decomposition products are stored separately in the
storage phase with minimal heat losses. The third phase is an exothermic discharging
phase, where the decomposition products are reunited in order to recompose storage
material C for future use in this same cycle. The energy released in this reaction is the
net energy that is obtained from the storage process (Abedin et al., 2011).
C + heat energy ↔ A + B
The states of the substances are not relevant, especially for the decomposition
products, but usually the original storage material C is a solid or a liquid material.
Decomposition product A can, for example, be a hydrate or a carbonate, and the other
decomposition product B water, carbon monoxide or ammonia. When choosing a
suitable storage material, the following properties must be considered: price, reactivity
and durability over multiple cycles, toxicity and other safety issues, corrosiveness,
availability and applicability to each process (Abedin et al., 2011).

2.2 ACTIVE MEANS FOR WASTE HEAT ENERGY UTILIZATION
2.2.1

HEAT PUMPS

Heat pumps are devices that are used to transfer heat energy in the opposite direction
than the Second Law of Thermodynamics commands; the temperature of the heat
source is increased and released into a heat sink. There are multiple types of heat
pumps, as illustrated in Figure 10, and they all require some form of external energy
to operate their heat transfer cycle. Heat pumps are quite common and they have many
advantages, as they typically have very high efficiency, they can be used to produce
heat from an environmentally friendly and renewable source such as air or ground, and
they can be used to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions with their energy
saving potentials. The disadvantages associated with heat pump operation include the
need of external energy such as electricity, potentially high investment costs, and

22

toxicity or flammability of refrigerants (Kiss et al., 2016a). A closer look at a
mechanically driven and a thermally driven heat pump is addressed in the next
sections.

Figure 10 Different types of heat pumps (Kiss et al., 2016b)

2.2.1.1 MECHANICAL HEAT PUMPS
Mechanical heat pumps are very common equipment both in industrial and domestic
use, as they can be used both for heating and cooling. For example, refrigerators and
air-conditioning equipment deploy heat pump technology with even a chance of
switching the operation principle from heating to cooling and vice versa with the same
device. Heat pumps are used to change the temperature level of heat energy QEV, and
a mechanical heat pump spends mechanical energy W to release heat energy QC in
target temperature TC (Dimian et al., 2014):
𝑄𝐶 = 𝑄𝐸𝑉 + 𝑊

(7)

A mechanical heat pump consists of an evaporator, a condenser, a mechanical
compressor, and an expansion valve. A refrigerant fluid is circulating between these
components and the whole operation of this device is dependent on the physical
properties of the refrigerant: its boiling point’s dependency from pressure (Brückner
et al., 2015).

23

The operation cycle of a mechanical heat pump is shown in Figure 11. The energy
flow from a waste heat source will be used to evaporate the refrigerant in the
evaporator even in low temperatures and pressures. The evaporated refrigerant will
travel to the compressor, where it is polytropic compressed into a higher pressure and
temperature. This compression step requires outside energy, usually in the form of
electrical energy, to operate the compressor. This means that when an investment for
a heat pump is under examination, the potentially increasing electricity consumption
will need to be taken into account in operation costs (Brückner et al., 2015, Dimian et
al., 2014).
After compression, the evaporated refrigerant will travel to the condenser and the
refrigerant is condensed into liquid state. The decrease in refrigerant temperature and
its state change will release an energy flow QC into the heat sink, and this is the desired
net energy flow that is obtained from the process. The liquefied refrigerant will be
directed back into the evaporator through an expansion valve, and the decrease in
pressure will create a mixed vapour-liquid phase for the refrigerant before a new cycle
begins with evaporation (Brückner et al., 2015, Dimian et al., 2014).

Figure 11 The operation principle of a mechanical heat pump. Waste heat provides the energy
flow QEV to evaporate the refrigerant and the condenser releases the net energy flow QC in an
elevated temperature (Brückner et al., 2015).

Temperatures of approximately 120…140 °C in the heat sink are reachable by using a
mechanical heat pump, although a more typical maximal temperature level that can be

24

reached in commercial applications is approximately 80 °C. The temperature increase
that is achieved with commercial applications is typically approximately 60 °C, and
the range of how much temperature can be increased in the heat pump is restricted by
the operation of the compressor, in other words, the pressure difference that can be
obtained over the compressor as well as the dependency ratio between the chosen
refrigerant’s temperature and pressure (Brückner et al., 2015).

2.2.1.2 ABSORPTION HEAT PUMPS
Similarly to mechanical heat pumps, the operation principle of absorption heat pumps
is also based on evaporation and condensation of a refrigerant, but instead of a
compressor requiring external (electrical) energy for operation, the circulation is
thermally driven. There are two circulating components, an absorbent and a
refrigerant, and currently there are two commercial alternatives for these closed system
mediums: water / aqueous lithium bromide solution, and ammonia / water. The
circulation loop for the refrigerant flows through all components in the absorption heat
pump, while the absorbent circulates between the generator and absorber, as is
illustrated in Figure 12 (Brückner et al., 2015).
The refrigerant is evaporated in low pressure and temperature with the energy provided
by waste heat, and the gasified refrigerant travels to the absorber, where it is absorbed
to the absorbent. Heat energy is released to a heat sink as the absorption occurs. The
mixture of the absorbent and refrigerant is pumped to the generator, thus increasing its
pressure, where thermal energy is introduced in order to evaporate the refrigerant out
of the absorbent. The thermal energy can be obtained from high-temperature waste
heat or from a utility. The absorbent continues in its own loop back to the absorber
through an expansion valve, while the refrigerant flows to the condenser. The
refrigerant will condense to liquid state in the condenser, releasing heat energy into a
heat sink, and the liquid will flow through an expansion valve to the evaporator in a
lowered pressure (Brückner et al., 2015, Kiss et al., 2016a).

25

Figure 12 Operation principle of an absorption heat pump (Brückner et al., 2015).

The amount of energy released by an absorption heat pump is the sum of energies
released from the absorber and the condenser. The absorption of the refrigerant can be
executed either in one or multiple steps with different types of equipment and
technologies, some of which are presented in Figure 13. The properties of the
refrigerant as well as the capacity the equipment is operated on, affect how the
circulation of the refrigerant is flowing through the equipment (Brückner et al., 2015).

Figure 13 The choice of a suitable absorption heat pump application is dependent on the
temperature levels of low and high temperature heat sources as well as the target temperature
of the rejected heat energy (Brückner et al., 2015).

26

The operation of an absorption heat pump requires relatively large volume flows and
it is more complex compared to a mechanical heat pump. However, the efficiency of
an absorption heat pump is extremely high in well-designed systems and it is not that
dependent on temperature increases. Despite these benefits for an absorption heat
pump, the mechanical heat pumps are significantly more common in commercial
applications with their extremely well-known and optimized technique. This can also
be caused by the larger investment costs of absorption heat pumps (Brückner et al.,
2015).

2.2.1.3 EFFICIENCY RATIOS FOR HEAT PUMPS
Characteristic ratios describing different forms of efficiency can be calculated for both
a mechanical and an absorption heat pump, and these ratios can be utilized when the
heat pump equipment is designed and when an investment decision is being made
(Brückner et al., 2015).
For a mechanical heat pump, a theoretical efficiency or Energy Efficiency Ratio EERth
can be calculated with the temperature difference between the lower temperature T0
[K] and the increased temperature T1 [K] (Brückner et al., 2015):
𝑇

0
𝐸𝐸𝑅𝑡ℎ = 𝑇 −𝑇
1

0

(8)

The Coefficient of Performance (COPth) can be calculated also by using these two
temperatures. The temperatures are in Kelvins (Brückner et al., 2015):
𝑇

1
𝐶𝑂𝑃𝑡ℎ = 𝑇 −𝑇
= 𝐸𝐸𝑅𝑡ℎ + 1
1

0

(9)

The actual efficiency is calculated based on the electrical energy required to operate
the system. In these equations, Q̇0 is the waste heat energy provided to the evaporator
and Q̇1 is the heat energy released from the condenser into the heat sink (Brückner et
al., 2015):

27

𝐶𝑂𝑃𝑒𝑙 =

𝑄̇1

(10)

𝑊𝑒𝑙
𝑄̇

𝐸𝐸𝑅𝑒𝑙 = 𝑊0

(11)

𝑒𝑙

In normal operation, typical values for a mechanical heat pump are COPel = 4 at most,
and EERel = 3. Typical efficiencies for nominal operation (EERth) are approximately
60% for mechanical heat pumps and approximately 70% for absorption heat pumps.
When these characteristic ratios are calculated for an absorption heat pump, the
temperatures in the generator/absorber T2 [K] are also required (Brückner et al., 2015):
𝑇

0
𝐸𝐸𝑅𝑡ℎ = (𝑇 −𝑇

∙
)

0

(𝑇2 −𝑇1 )
𝑇2
(𝑇2 −𝑇0 )
𝑇2

(12)
= 𝐸𝐸𝑅𝑡ℎ + 1 (13)

For absorption heat pumps used as chillers, the actual efficiencies of the application
are calculated analogous to those of a mechanical heat pump, but the values are
typically significantly higher. EERel can be even 20 or higher with well-designed
refrigeration systems, the value typically being approximately 12. These chiller
applications do not require a cooler to release heat energy and the heat released is
approximately 2.5 times the amount of waste heat energy provided to the system, and
the values of COPel can reach 40, even 60 (Brückner et al., 2015).
Heat pumps can be used in various applications and obtain moderate COP values even
with under 10 °C waste heat sources. The stability and sufficiency of the flow of waste
heat energy are emphasized with colder heat energy sources in order to have technical
and economic feasibility for a heat pump investment (Gynther et al., 2019).

2.2.2

ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE

The Organic Rankine Cycle or ORC is a combined heat and power generation process
that can be used for internal small-scale electricity production (Quoilin et al., 2013). It
is a circulation process where instead of water being used as a circulating liquid, an
organic substance is used, and this substance will evaporate and condensate in the

28

different cycle steps based on its substance properties. With suitable circulation
liquids, even 100 °C heat sources can be utilized in small-scale electricity production,
but typically the generation of electricity will be achieved with a better efficiency by
using hotter energy sources up to 350 °C (Maaskola et al., 2014).

Figure 14 Two simplified illustrations of ORC, without a recuperator and with it (Quoilin et
al., 2013).

The main equipment utilized for ORC are a feed pump, a boiler or a heat exchanger to
operate as an evaporator, a turbine, a condenser, and a recuperator, as shown in Figure
14. The feed pump increases the pressure of the circulation liquid up to its boiling
pressure, and then the liquid’s temperature is elevated until it boils in a boiler or in a
heat exchanger evaporator. The function of the turbine is to salvage mechanical energy
which is released when the evaporated circulation liquid expands into a decreased
pressure. This low-pressure steam will then travel into the condenser, where it is
condensed into liquid form (Maaskola et al., 2014). The efficiency of the equipment
can be improved by inserting a recuperator to pre-heat the liquid that is traveling from
the feed pump into the evaporator. Pre-heating can be executed by using the heat
energy provided by the low-pressure superheated steam that is traveling to the
condenser. (Quoilin et al., 2013).

29

A theoretical efficiency for this cycle can be calculated as a Carnot efficiency with
temperatures in Kelvins:
𝑇

𝜂 = 1 − 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛

𝑚𝑎𝑥

(14)

where Tmax is the temperature of the waste heat source and Tmin is the minimum
temperature that is gained in the condenser. In practice, 45% of this theoretical
efficiency can maximally be achieved, but in low temperature processes, the efficiency
for electricity generation remains nevertheless relatively low, under 10%. These
temperatures that are used in determining the efficiency of the cycle also affect the
election of a suitable circulation liquid for each application (Maaskola et al., 2014).
The circulation liquids can be categorized based on their saturation vapour curves to
wet, isentropic and dry liquids. Figure 15 presents the differences between these three
types of fluids. For example, water is a wet fluid, which will demand to be superheated
in order to prevent premature condensation which might damage the turbine blades.
The isentropic and dry fluids do not require to be superheated, making these types of
fluids more suitable for ORC. Isentropic fluids remain as saturated vapour throughout
the turbine (Bao & Zhao, 2013) and a characteristic quality for dry circulation liquids
is that they can be superheated when they are expanding in the turbine (Maaskola et
al., 2014).
A suitable circulation liquid should be chosen for each application in order to ensure
that the evaporation and condensation properties of this substance are optimal
regarding the pressure and temperature utilized in the Rankine process. As most dry
organic circulation liquids utilized in these applications superheat as they expand in
the turbine, traditional erosion problems in the turbine caused by moisture can be
avoided. Compared to water, these organic liquids typically have a significantly larger
molar mass, which contributes to and enhances the transformation of gas expansion
into mechanical work in the turbine with decreased pressures and more simplified
turbine structures. Additionally, the decrease in specific enthalpy is typically lower
than with water, which allows single step turbines to be utilized without compromising
efficiency (Maaskola et al., 2014).

30

Additionally, compared to a traditional water cycle, the organic circulation liquids tend
to wear out mechanical parts less, they lubricate the moving parts or their electrical
properties are such that there are no adverse effects if they are released, for example,
to the generator. Despite these positive properties, organic circulation liquids naturally
also have disadvantages, such as the fact that they are often harmful to the
environment, toxic, or inflammable. As organic substances, they tend to decompose in
high temperatures and they can react chemically if contact with other substances, such
as air or lubricants, is permitted. They are typically also more expensive than water
and less available. Typical organic liquids that are used often in the Organic Rankine
Cycle

are

for

example,

n-pentane,

silicon

oil

(octamethyltrisiloxane,

polyphenylemethyledimethylesiloxane), and toluene (Maaskola et al., 2014).

Figure 15 The saturation vapour curves for different types of circulation fluids, a) wet, b)
isentropic, and c) dry (Bao & Zhao, 2013).

31

Instead of using an organic substance as the circulation liquid, a mixture of water and
ammonia can be used. This also changes the name of the cycle from Rankine to Kalina
cycle, and enables higher efficiencies to be achieved, but more complex and expensive
equipment is required for the process (Maaskola et al., 2014).
The heat can be introduced to the Rankine process with a thermal oil circulation or by
directly heating up the organic cycling substance with the heat source. ORC can utilize
simpler equipment in its circulation than traditional steam cycles, as with once-through
boilers there is no need for water drums and recirculation. (Quoilin et al., 2013). A
traditional turbine technique is typically used with an air-cooled generator and a
lubrication oil system. In ORC, besides acting as the liquid to be circulated in the
system, the organic circulation liquid can simultaneously act as a lubricant and a
refrigerant for the generator, which enables hermetic sealing of the whole equipment
entity, thus, preventing any leakages to the surroundings (Maaskola et al., 2014).
The efficient operation of the turbine and a suitable circulation liquid are crucial for
the total performance of the ORC system (Quoilin et al., 2013). Operating the turbine
with optimal efficiency requires that it is operated with a sufficient gas flow velocity.
If a small equipment is utilized with small impellers, the necessary decrease in
circumferential speed due to the size must be compensated by increasing the rotation
speed. In scenarios such as this, the impellers of the turbine can rotate approximately
30,000 rounds per second, which means that the turbine is operated with a so-called
high velocity technique (Maaskola et al., 2014).
The thermal power obtained with ORC is typically 1 to 50 MWth, and the electrical
efficiency of the turbine is 0.2 to 10 MW with a power to heat ratio of approximately
20% / 80%, leading to the total efficiency being as high as 98%. The condensation step
that releases energy can be executed for example to water or to pre-heat combustion
air, thus, enabling the recovery and utilization of heat energy. When ORC is used to
recover heat energy from low temperature waste heat sources, the electricity
efficiencies typically remain relatively low, under 10%. Additionally, as a sufficiently
large heat energy sink is required where the heat energy can be released from the
process, having a possibility to recover condensation to heat up a stream of water

32

would be ideal, instead of removing the heat energy unused in a waste stream
(Maaskola et al., 2014).
The problem with low temperature heat energy flows is that most of the heat energy
released to the heat sink has such a low temperature that its further utilization is no
longer reasonable. Additionally, especially in low temperature processes, the volume
flows should be large, which also increases the costs caused by the electricity utilized
to enable pumping of the liquid flows, thus, potentially decreasing the overall costefficient profitability for the ORC investment. In order to make use of ORC profitable
for low temperature heat sources, the heat energy provided to the Rankine cycle should
be practically free of charge and it should be readily available in a sufficient amount
so that the peak operation time in the Organic Rankine Cycle operation can be
maximized. The electricity price should also be relatively high in order for the ORC
process to maximize the savings it creates, and also, the distances that liquids are
pumped should not be unreasonably long (Maaskola et al., 2014).

2.3 UTILIZATION OF WASTE HEAT IN REGIONAL OR DISTRICT HEATING
NETWORKS

If there are no possibilities for utilization of recovered heat energy within the plant
itself, either in its processes or to keep the properties heated, its utilization by external
parties can be studied. Waste heat can be sold to external parties in the same industrial
area, possibly to a regional heat network, or to a district heating company to be used
in the district heating network.
All possibilities to join new heat sources to a district heating network requires caseby-case examination. The temperature and pressure levels of the waste heat source
must be harmonized according to the point of the district heating network the waste
heat would be attached to, and additionally, the whole district heating network stability
and equilibrium must be evaluated to consider the changes this new heat source might
cause for it. These evaluations are necessary in order to ensure reliable and effective
operation of the network. The following questions can be used to aid in the design of
a correct attachment point to each source (Sirola et al., 2018):

33

-

What is the value of the heat provided to the network?
What kind of heat energy and how much of its production is displaced by the
new heat energy source?
What is the capacity of the current district heating network and where are its
potential constraints?
What is the point and means of attachment?
What is the temperature provided to the network? Is it controllable?
What is the pressure in the attachment point and is it possible to pump the water
to be fed into the network into this pressure?
What is the reliability of delivery for the waste heat source?
How is the operability and control of the network ensured?
How to ensure the optimization of the operability of the entire district heating
network?
How will the responsibilities be divided between the two parties (purchaser
and supplier) regarding investment, maintenance, and operational costs?

The temperature level of the waste heat source to be attached to a district heating
network will have an effect on the amount of heat transfer available and the technique
to be chosen for heat transfer. The design temperature of a district heating network is
120 °C. The temperature of water in the flow going to the utilization points changes
depending on ambient temperature, which is typically between 75 and 115 °C (or for
low temperature network 65 and 90 °C), and temperature in the flow returning from
the network is typically between 40 and 60 °C. The design pressure is typically 1.6
MPa (1.0 MPa for some district heating networks), and the pressure in the outgoing
pipeline close to the main heat energy production plant is practically close to this
design pressure when the plant is operating at maximal capacity. The pressure
difference between the outgoing and incoming pipelines of the network can be
relatively high near the main production plant, even 1.0 MPa, even though the design
pressure difference between these two flows is typically 0.55...0.6 MPa (Sirola et al.,
2018).
Heat energy is primarily fed into the pipeline outgoing from the main production plant,
because feeding it into the returning pipeline will increase heat losses and decrease the
overall efficiency of the network. Design criteria and values for the pump that is

34

feeding water into the network from a waste heat source are selected upon the
prevailing pressure in the network at the attachment point (Sirola et al., 2018).
The attachment of waste heat to a district heating network is always conducted
indirectly with a heat exchanger separating the network and the waste heat energy. The
possibility and opportunity to utilize waste heat energy to heat up water that is fed into
a district heating network can be improved by increasing its temperature with different
techniques, such as heat pumps or boilers (Sirola et al., 2018).
The amount of heat energy that can be fed into a district heating network is always
restricted by the current consumption in the network, which can be relatively low
especially during summer months. The basic principle for choosing the heat sources
to be utilized among the ones that are currently available in the network is by utilizing
them in the order of affordability. This means, that the intake of heat energy may not
be perpetual, and fluctuation is caused by seasonal change as well as potential failure
or disturbance situations. In these kinds of occurrences, the heat reception capacity
might be weakened or even entirely cut off. The waste heat energy supplies must be
prepared and equipped for these kinds of situations and, when necessary and with
sufficient speed, be able to interrupt waste heat production or route it to some other
destination temporarily (Sirola et al., 2018).
In a situation where a heat pump is connected to a district heating system, it will act as
a boundary between the district heating network and an individual heat source and,
thus, the party that owns, maintains and controls the heat pump should be carefully
considered. Would it be more efficient and profitable, if the district heating company
owns and operates the heat pump, thus, being able to better control the efficiency and
operability of the entire district heating network? When examined from the opposing
viewpoint, the investment, operation, and maintenance costs of a single heat pump
might not outweigh the benefits. When considering this issue, also taxation should be
borne in mind (Rämä et al., 2020). In Finland, since the beginning of 2021, heat pumps
providing heat to a district heating system can be taxed with a lower taxation group
(the European Commission, 2021). This obviously requires the consumption of
electricity used for that given heat pump to be measured and taxed separately if the
company itself belongs to the higher tax category. Lowering the tax group of such heat

35

pumps can increase the interest of industrial companies to seek possibilities for such
co-operation with district heating companies (Rämä et al., 2020).
The waste heat sources provided by industry are typically large and point-like, and
even though the temperature level they provide can have great variations, they are
usually on a higher temperature level when compared to waste heat sources provided
by urban areas or nature. With industrial waste heat sources, one of the most typical
features is the uncertainty about their stable delivery certainty or the level of heat
energy provided at any given time point. These variations and uncertainties may be
caused by planned or unplanned plant shutdowns, and the level of heat energy provided
to the district heating network can alternate in relation to predefined process
parameters and production levels. As waste heat is a by-product, its production levels
are not the driving parameters to how the production plant is operated, and this also
means that a district heating company does not have any controlling possibilities
concerning the amount of heat energy they receive from one source. Typically, the
heat energy provided to the district heating network remains relatively stable, despite
these characteristics, enabling them to be counted on as one of the basic loads provided
to the district heating system. Other alternative heat production capacities are operated
accordingly based on the basic load in the system (Rämä et al., 2020).
According to a study conducted among different Finnish district heating companies
during summer 2020, approximately 88% of these companies are already utilizing
waste heat sources in their networks. The remaining 12% are currently not utilizing
waste heat but are interested in it and are negotiating possibilities for utilization.
Generally speaking, district heating companies are interested in acquiring heat energy
from waste heat when it is technically and economically possible, as this enables them
to decrease their emissions and source cost-effective heat to their customers, thus, also
ensuring that district heating remains a competitive and interesting product (Tiitinen,
2020).
District heating companies are well familiarized with large and high temperature waste
heat sources, but they are also working with locating potential sources to provide a
lower temperature heat, which could be utilized by increasing the temperature with,
for example, a heat pump. It is evaluated that the share of waste heat, geoenergy, and

36

heat pumps will increase from the current 10% to 30% in the next 10 years (Tiitinen,
2020).

3 CASE STUDY FOR IDENTIFICATION AND UTILIZATION OF
EXCESS HEAT
The potentials of utilizing excess heat energy were studied with a case study for
Finnfeeds Finland Co factory in Naantali. This survey was carried out as a part of an
obligatory energy audit, where the energy consumption in the process and facilities
were examined in its entirety. The opportunities to utilize waste energy was chosen for
closer examination in this audit, because the energy efficiency of the plant has been
recognized as an important potential for improvement.
Finnfeeds Finland Co is a part of the American IFF corporation, and it refines sugar
beet molasses into fine chemicals. The main products can be utilized in food, feed,
cosmetic or chemical industry applications. The Naantali plant has a long history, as it
began operation already in the 1950s as a sugar factory. The factory has been in its
current use since the 1990s (Port of Naantali, 2021, DeVeau, 2021).
The refining process of sugar beet molasses is a highly energy-intensive process, as it
includes processing in sufficient temperatures as well as removing a large amount of
water, as the products are primarily in crystal form. The raw materials are heated up
to temperatures of 70…95 °C, and after the pre-treatment steps, such as filtration, the
raw material is separated into different fractions with chromatographic separation. All
fractions are evaporated to remove excess water, and most of the fractions are
evaporated by an external party with an MVR evaporator. By utilizing this external
party, Adven, to evaporate the main fractions, significant reduction in steam usage has
been achieved by the Naantali plant since beginning this cooperation in 2018 (Adven,
2021).
After the separation and evaporation of the fractions, they are further processed into
their final form by first crystallizing them in a crystallization boiler. The solids content
is significantly increased in the crystallization boiler and the crystals are separated

37

from the massequite with centrifugation. Before the product is ready to be stored and
packed, it has to be dried even further with a drier utilizing cold and hot air to remove
any remains of water, producing a dry and solid product crystal.
The major utility systems in Naantali are steam, air, and different water systems such
as hot water, cold water, and cooling water which comes from the sea. Heat transfer is
mainly carried out with either steam or cooling water; only a few heat exchangers
utilize hot water or other process streams as a source for heating or cooling. Besides
these utilities, for example, some chemicals are also utilized in the process or in
cleaning of the equipment. Many of the utility systems also require heating, and also
these heat exchange operations are mainly carried out with steam.
As there are many unit operations where water is evaporated, there is a significant
amount of secondary steam available. Currently this secondary steam is condensed
with surface condensers and the condensate is utilized again in the processes. This
state change is achieved with cooling water, meaning that the large amount of energy
released from the state change is transferred to the cooling water and exits the plant as
the cooling water is returned to sea after use.
The process is a mixture of continuously operating unit operations and batch-wise
operating unit operations, which makes the integration of processes and their energy
requirements more difficult. Currently, there is very little utilization of waste heat
energy anywhere in the Naantali plant, even though some theoretically possible waste
heat sources have been identified.
The premise for this survey was to systematically go through the process and define
an energy balance for it, as well as:
-

identify theoretically, technically and economically available waste heat
sources;
identify theoretically, technically and economically available heat sinks;
carry out a preliminary design for aforementioned potentials for utilization of
waste heat;
carry out preliminary cost estimation calculations as well as evaluate potential
investment payback time and savings in operation costs (utility costs).

38

The principles of waste heat utilization illustrated in Figure 2 in the Introduction
chapter of this thesis were followed in this case study survey, meaning that the primary
focus was to find the available heat sinks for waste heat internally. Despite this, also
the alternative for waste heat utilization in district heating was briefly examined, as
this option was thought to be an interesting one worth of investigating.

3.1 ENERGY BALANCE
Currently, most of the heat exchangers are operated with steam or cooling water, which
is not necessarily particularly energy efficient; only a few heat exchangers are using
hot water or another process stream as a heat transfer medium. Most heat exchangers
have a temperature measurement in the hot side of the stream that is being heated, so
additional measurements were required with a portable surface temperature
measurement device in order to be able to define a change in the temperature over the
heat exchangers. The substantial use of steam as a heat transfer medium provides a
fruitful starting point for decreasing primary energy consumption, if useful alternative
medias for heat exchange are identified.
The survey began with gaining an understanding of the production process and the
energy sinks in it. This phase included multiple interviews with various staff members,
first introducing the operation principles of the process and then deepening this
knowledge with more information about the ways energy is utilized throughout the
plant. The different unit operations of the process were discussed, as were also the
different utility systems that are in operation. After gaining an understanding of how
the process is operating, studying the current state of the process and evaluating the
parts in need of heat transfer were carried out. This was carried out, in addition to the
previously mentioned interviews, by examining the process from PI diagrams,
collecting measurement data for useful process measurements, and executing
additional measurements in situ. In addition, a large number of documents provided
by Finnfeeds Finland were utilized to examine the production and energy consumption
from 2020, as well as production plans and mass balances illustrating how the product
compounds are moving through the operation of the process.

39

The properties of different substances and streams were determined based on mass
balances and universal values. For example, the densities of water, sea water and air
were determined to be 999 kg/m3, 1,026 kg/m3, and 1.006 kg/m3, respectively. The
densities of the process streams range between 970…1,100 kg/m3. For water (and
steam), many of the values needed in the calculations, such as specific enthalpy or
enthalpy of evaporation, are dependable on pressure, so these values in the calculations
were chosen accordingly. The specific enthalpy and specific heat capacity for all gases
(e.g., exhaust air and odour gases) were not known, so reference values for air were
used in calculations. As the specific heat capacities for the process streams (raw
materials, intermediary flows, or products) are not known, the reference values of
either water (4.19 kJ/kgK) or Thermera R (3 kJ/kgK) were utilized.
The energy balance for the process was divided into the different departments
functioning inside the plant, which was also a logical way of division, because only
one of the departments operates continuously, while the other ones are operated
according to production demands in a batch-wise style. The purpose of this energy
balance was to give an overall illustration of the process properties such as flow,
temperature, and solids content, to show the unit operations in the process where
heating or cooling of the process stream is required, and to illustrate estimates on how
much energy is wasted either to cooling water (sea water), effluent water, or in gas
phase into the odour gas treatment system.
Based on average consumptions of heating and cooling utilities, the total value of
consumption can be divided into percentages for different unit operations according to
Figures 16 and 17. Besides presenting the cold utility utilization, Figure 17 presents
other means for heat energy to exit the process, in other words some of the identified
waste heat sources are also considered in this pie chart.

The average total energy consumptions were calculated based on measurement data
from 2020. The average total steam consumption was calculated to be 5.5 MW or
4,000 MWh per month, and 0.1 MW and 40 MWh of condensate was returned from
the factory to the company providing the steam on average per hour or month,
respectively. The heat load transferred from the process to the cooling water system
and returned to the sea was calculated based on average monthly flow rates and a
temperature difference of 10 °C between the incoming and outgoing cooling water.
The average heat load in the cooling water was estimated to be 3.8 MW and 2,400

41

MWh per month. The amount of odour gases was estimated based on the design value
and operational efficiency of the odour gas blower and an average temperature 25 °C.
An illustration of the total energy balance with different waste heat sources is
presented in Chapter 3.3 in Figure 24.

3.2 PINCH ANALYSIS
The energy balance was used as an information source for the Pinch Analysis, which
was carried out with three individual scenarios to best describe the different production
models in the factory. These scenarios considered the continuous and batch-wise unit
operations in the different process departments. In all of these scenarios, the
continuously operating unit processes are addressed similarly, and the scenarios differ
according to alternative products batch processes:
1. Continuous unit operations and batch process for Product 1
2. Continuous unit operations and batch process for Product 2
3. Continuous unit operations and batch process for Product 3
The Pinch Analysis was carried out with Aspen Energy Analyzer V10. A value of 2
°C was used as ΔTmin, as most of the heat exchangers in the Naantali plant are countercurrent plate heat exchangers with possibilities for very efficient heat transfer. The
streams chosen to be included in the Pinch Analysis were such that require regular
heating or cooling. Due to this, all of the different CIP (Cleaning In Place) cleanings
that are carried out regularly or irregularly in the factory were simplified as one CIP
stream in this survey. The initial and target temperatures for each stream were chosen
to represent a stable operation situation for the process, so the results obtained from
this analysis do not consider such situations as start-up or shut-down, where additional
energy could be required.
A Composite Curve and a Grand Composite Curve were plotted for each scenario and
they are presented in the following Figures 18…23.

42

Figure 18 Composite Curve for scenario 1.

As can be seen from the CC, there is a larger demand for heating energy than for
cooling. This can be explained partly with the data that was analysed with Pinch
Analysis, as it also included utility streams that require heating. Additionally, the
difference between these two Composite Curves is explained with the energy that is
now dissipated to the environment, and both of these aspects can be seen also more
substantial in the results of the other two scenarios. All in all, there are only a few
process streams that require cooling but do not include a state change, and also
explains the comparably small hot Composite Curve.

Figure 19 Grand Composite Curve for scenario 1.

43

The Pinch point for scenario 1 was 56 °C, as shown in the GCC. The plant’s heat
exchangers were examined based on the Pinch points obtained from each scenario to
determine whether or not they are operating over the Pinch point. Appendix 1 contains
the list of all heat exchangers and the evaluation for each scenario, and it was
discovered that for scenario 1, there are 16 heat exchangers out of 50 that are operated
over the scenario’s Pinch point. This represents an estimated 37% of the heating and
cooling demands in this scenario.

Figure 20 Composite Curve for scenario 2.

The significant difference in heating and cooling demands was much more emphasized
in the second scenario, as there are less streams that are cooled when Product 2 is in
production. Most of the streams requiring cooling are cooled in order to carry out a
state change, which can be seen in the CC as steep slopes.

44

Figure 21 Grand Composite Curve for scenario 2.

The Pinch point for scenario 2 was 30 °C and according to Appendix 1, there are
currently 9 out of 46 heat exchangers that are operated over the Pinch point, which
stands for 33% of the scenario’s heating and cooling energy demands.

Figure 22 Composite Curve for scenario 3.

Similarly, also scenario 3 contains less streams requiring cooling than scenario 1, and
the form of the cooling CC is heavily impacted of the state changes caused by cooling
of secondary steams. The GCC for scenario 3 presents that the Pinch point for this
scenario is at 45 °C. According to Appendix 1, there are 9 out of 46 heat exchangers

45

that are operated over the Pinch point, which represent approximately 29% of the
heating and cooling energy demands in this scenario.

Figure 23 Grand Composite Curve for scenario 3.

When examining the heat exchangers that are operated over the Pinch points in
different scenarios, it can be noticed that there are seven heat exchangers that are
operated over all of the three Pinch points. Some of these are associated with utilities,
one with heating of raw material, and some are surface condensers.
Despite the differences between these scenarios and their Composite Curves, it can be
concluded that in the current operational models, there is a limited number of
possibilities for process integration due to the scarcity of streams that need to be cooled
down compared to the number of streams that require heating in suitable temperature
levels. This means that most probably there are multiple separate sources for waste
heat, and these are examined further in the following section. As most of the process
streams or utilities are heated up to a relatively high temperature of 70…95 °C, it is
especially difficult to find possibilities for process integration in these higher
temperature levels. Additionally, as most of the streams in need of cooling actually
require to be cooled down in order to carry out a state change which needs to be
executed in a controlled fashion, this also complicates process integration.

46

The minimum energy requirements or energy targets for hot and cold utilities are
obtained from the Pinch Analysis, and they are gathered together with the actual
average hot and cold utility consumptions in Table 2. The actual average consumptions
are based on measurement data from 2020.

As can be seen from the table data, the average consumptions are larger than the energy
targets, especially with cooling utilities. This can at least partly be explained by the
simultaneous operation of batch processes producing different products. In addition,
the scarcity of process integration explains why the average consumption for utilities
is higher than the Energy Targets. As the heating demands are much more emphasized
than the cooling demands, the possibilities of finding suitable process integration pairs
with compatible temperature levels may be challenging.

3.3 WASTE HEAT SOURCES
The biggest sources for waste heat sources such as secondary steam and cooling water
were already identified as waste heat prior to this survey. By utilizing the data obtained
from the energy balances and Pinch Analysis, the different sources for waste heat were
identified. All of these sources are gathered in Tables 13…15 in Appendix 2, and only
the largest individual sources that were identified are illustrated in Figure 24 together
with the average steam consumption in order to illustrate them in as a type of energy
balance. The heat content in each waste heat source was estimated with average mass
flows and specific enthalpies. The amount of condensates’ expansion steam was
estimated based on total steam consumption.

47

Figure 24 The biggest sources of waste heat and their average heat loads.

The waste heat sources include purified exhaust gas and air streams, waste and cooling
waters as well as some final or intermediary products that currently are routed without
any cooling from the process to their storage tanks. There are currently multiple
storage tanks located outside in the Naantali factory, and a part of these tanks contain
liquids that are in relatively high temperatures and there are no heating coils or other
means of maintaining the temperature in the liquid. In such tanks, the temperature of
the liquid is decreasing over time as the heat energy dissipated to the environment.
The tables in Appendix 2 present the theoretical, technical and economic potentials for
each waste heat source. The economic potential was determined either based on the
preliminary investment proposals sketched up in this thesis or by evaluating the
probability of their economic viability. The total theoretical potential was estimated to
be 24 MW, technical potential 23.7 MW and economic potential 22.6 MW. As many
of the identified waste heat sources were such that are now requiring cooling in order
to carry out a state change, the total potential presented in these tables must be
interpreted in such a way that the heat energy can be recovered from one source only,

48

either directly from the individual source replacing the cooling utility, or from the
cooling water system as a part of its total heat load.
As can be seen from the Tables 13…15 and from Figure 24, the temperature of
identified waste heat sources remains relatively low. The heat loads provided by
individual waste heat sources also vary significantly from each other. Despite this large
variance between these sources, there are possibilities of finding utilizations for them
as the process contains a lot of potential heat sinks with different amounts and
temperature demands. Basically, all flows in need of temperature increase are potential
heat sinks, but what might become problematic is the fact that many of them require
heating to a relatively high temperature, which cannot be achieved with waste heat
sources by passive means of heat transfer.
Some preliminary investment proposals were sketched in order to utilize some of these
identified waste heat sources and simultaneously decrease the number of heat
exchangers that are operated over the Pinch point(s).

4 POTENTIALS FOR UTILIZATION OF WASTE HEAT
For the utilization of waste heat found in the process, several preliminary investment
proposals were outlined. All of these proposals include an energy balance to show how
the waste heat energy can be utilized, and these balances are based on certain
production capacities for different products.
An illustration of the energy balance as well as required modifications or additions to
the existing equipment or piping were illustrated on flow sheets in Appendix 3. No
additional details such as pressure gauges or by-pass pipelines are presented in these
flow sheets, the purpose of them is solely to illustrate what is required and what is
achieved temperature-wise with each waste heat source and sink pair.
Investment costs were calculated by utilizing AFRY’s average price database for
equipment and pipelines. The estimation for mechanical works includes materials and
installation work for pipelines, manual valves and all pipe accessories needed for

49

installation of each pipeline. The prices for electrical, automation, and instrumentation
works (EIA) were estimated with appropriate percentages (5…50%) from equipment
and mechanical work prices. The investment costs were also evaluated in comparison
with other investments executed in Naantali to determine how well they are estimated
in relation to known costs, and adjusted when necessary.
Following tax free prices for steam and electricity were utilized to estimate potential
utility savings or costs:
-

Steam 40 €/MWh
Electricity 43 €/MWh

The payback time for these investment proposals was determined without any interest
rate, because a proper interest rate was not yet known in Finnfeeds Finland Co, caused
by the on-going change of company owner.
All of the heat transfer calculations were carried out with the basic formula for heat
transfer:
𝑄̇ = 𝑚̇ ∙ 𝑐𝑝 ∙ ∆𝑇,

(15)

where ṁ = mass flow [kg/s], cp = specific heat capacity [kJ/kgK], and ΔT = temperature
difference [K]. With streams that included state change, cp in this formula is replaced
with specific latent heat capacity L [kJ/kg] and ΔT is not considered the calculation.
As the specific heat capacities for the process streams (raw materials, intermediary
flows, or products) are not known, the reference values of either water (4.19 kJ/kgK)
or Thermera R (3 kJ/kgK) were utilized. The densities of the process streams range
between approximately 970 kg/m3 and 1,100 kg/m3.
For each proposal including a heat pump, the cost for increased electricity utilization
was evaluated. A value for the required amount of electricity was required for this and
these values were calculated as Wel [kW or MW] based on the heat energy Q̇1 [kW or
MW] provided by the heat pump:
𝑊𝑒𝑙 = 0.35 ∙ 𝑄1̇

(16)

50

The size of the pumps was preliminary calculated with assumptions on pressure
differences over the pump.
(17)

𝑑𝑝 = ∑ 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 + 𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 − 𝑝ℎ𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑐 + ∑ 𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 ,

where ploss = pressure losses caused by equipment, piping, etc. [kPa], prequired = required
pressure achieved with the pump [kPa], and phead / phydrostatic = ρ∙g∙h [kPa] with ρ =
density [kg/m3], g = 9.81 m/s2 and h = surface level / pump head [m].
The electricity required for pump operation with 10% additional design was calculated
from
𝑊𝑒𝑙 = 𝑣̇ ∙ 𝑑𝑝 ∙ 1.1,

(18)

where v̇ = volume flow in [m3/s] and dp = pressure difference between suction and
pressure side in [kPa].
A preliminary location for each new equipment was proposed based on space
availabilities in the facility, and the piping routed to each destination were estimated
based on a 3D model and the plant layout.

4.1 INTERNAL UTILIZATION
The following preliminary proposals include multiple identified waste heat sources,
and they were chosen as suitable heat sinks were identified for their utilization. These
waste heat streams include individual product or cooling streams as well as the entire
facility’s cooling utility network, and they were chosen for further investigation
because of their potential temperature level or energy contents. Additionally, the
hygienic risks these waste heat source and sink pairs contain was expected to remain
in a feasible level.
Condensates’ expansion steam contains a relatively large amount of energy in a
considerably high temperature, which would make its utilization highly beneficial.

51

However, no investment proposals were sketched out for its utilization as there are
previously made designs for improvements in the operation and utilization of
condensates and their expansion steams.
The processes produce a varying amount of waste water, but no preliminary
investment proposal was sketched up for its utilization because of the highly varying
nature. The main equipment for waste water treatment and storage are located outside
relatively far away from potential heat sinks, and the temperature dissipates to the
environment from these tanks. There are possibilities to circulate the waste water in
the waste water treatment system with a relatively steady flow, but the temperature of
this source cannot be controlled so this was thought to decrease the efficient utilization
of this source, especially as most likely its utilization would also require an expensive
heat pump investment. Additionally, the operation of a heat pump usually requires a
relatively stable inflow of energy as the efficient operation range is quite narrow, and
this stability is not identified in this waste heat source with the materials that were
studied.

4.1.1

UTILIZATION OF WASTE HEAT FROM PRODUCT STREAM TO RAW MATERIAL
STREAM

A product stream, which is here named as Product 4, is currently flowing in a
temperature of 68 °C from the process into its storage tank without cooling, and the
heat energy dissipates into the atmosphere from the storage tank as the liquid is waiting
to be loaded into trucks. The amount of this flow is relatively small, only 0.7 m3/h, but
as it is a continuous flow, the potentials for waste heat recovery are theoretically and
technically feasible. To maximize this potential, a suitable heat sink with a relatively
continuous heat energy demand and a sufficiently low mass flow and initial
temperature should be found. Such a flow is the intake of Raw Material 1, which is
currently stored in ambient temperature in a tank located outside. The mean
temperature of Raw Material is 10 °C as it comes into the process with a volume flow
of 1.8 m3/h.

52

With following temperature changes dT from supply temperature T0 to goal
temperature T1, approximately 27 kW of waste heat energy can be recovered from
Product 4 and utilized to pre-heat Raw Material 1, as presented in Table 3:

This pre-heating step can be carried out with a new heat exchanger, which can be
located in the vicinity of the current routes of both stream’s pipelines. Instruments such
as temperature gauges and automatic valves are required for easy operation, but all in
all, this investment proposition requires relatively little to be carried out.

To estimate the possible savings from steam usage, the heating of Raw Material 1 must
be studied in its entirety. After the pre-heating of Raw Material 1, the flow will need
to be heated up to 80 °C with the existing heat exchange equipment. Currently there
are five heat exchangers coupled in the same hot water circulation, which is heated up
with a steam heat exchanger. A simple flow scheme of this pre-heating system is
presented in Figure 25 as well as in the flow sheet in Appendix 3. While studying the
potential savings for this proposal it was noticed that currently the third heat exchanger
HE-1211 is cooling the raw material, transferring the heat energy from the raw material
back to the water circulation. This is a remnant of an old operational model, and
currently there is no need to utilize this third heat exchanger for cooling purposes.

53

Figure 25 The basic principle for pre-heating of Raw Material 1, including the proposed waste
heat recovery and bypassing of HE-1211 (in dashed lines). The bypassing of HE-1211 is here
illustrated with a line, even though in reality this can be implemented with automation and
valves and without any new pipelines.

If the heat exchanger HE-1211 is bypassed, steam consumption is expected to slightly
increase in order to replace the energy that was formerly provided to the water
circulation by the heat exchanger. Additionally, as the temperature of Raw Material 1
is higher as it comes to the fourth heat exchanger, the duty for this heat exchanger is
expected to decrease, thus decreasing the total heat energy demand of the hot water
circulation. The flow sheet in Appendix 3 for this investment proposal is sketched
according to heat exchanger duties when HE-1211 is bypassed. Different operational
models for heating up Raw Material 1 are evaluated in Table 4.

HE-1211 is recommended as there is no real reason to utilize this heat exchanger as a
cooler. The payback time of 3.8 years for an investment of this size is slightly long but
remains within economic feasibility nonetheless.

4.1.2

WASTE HEAT RECOVERY FROM DRIER EXHAUST AIR

It is very common for property ventilating units to have heat recovery with a heat pump
between the exhaust air and incoming air channels, and a similar principle could be
applied to driers D1 and D3, as both of them take in air in ambient temperature and
currently utilize steam to heat it up, releasing a warm exhaust air flow. Both driers
utilize cold air as well as hot air, which means that heat recovery between the two
incoming air channels could also be a possibility, if a heat pump would be utilized to
cool down the incoming cool air, and utilize this heat energy in an increased
temperature to warm up the incoming hot air. Despite the excellent theoretical
potential of this option, it is not easily carried out as the cooling demand for cold air is
regulated based on the moisture content in the air, and this varies significantly based
on ambient weather conditions as well as seasonal changes.
Another option for utilization of waste heat from drier’s exhaust air is to circulate a
heat transfer liquid between the exhaust air and incoming (hot) air channel. This
requires heat exchanger units in both air channels, which leads to a decreased
efficiency in total heat transfer. Also, this is a passive means of waste heat utilization,
meaning that the temperature in the exhaust air is a limiting factor for increasing the

55

temperature in the incoming air side, and resulting in continuing utilization of steam
in order to increase the temperature in the required level.

4.1.2.1 DRIER D1
Drier D1 utilizes hot air in 85 °C temperature with a volume flow of 6,500 m3/h, and
the same amount of dried cold air in approximately 30 °C. Both incoming air flows
have individual channels with necessary heat exchangers and other equipment. The
hot air is heated up with two heat exchangers, the first utilizing hot water and the
second increasing the temperature into the desired level with steam. The energy needed
for heating the hot air is approximately 164 kW. When the drier is in operation, there
are no possibilities for sequential operation, resulting in a stable operation of air flow
without taking into account whether there is a process flow to be dried or not. The air
flow exits the drier through a dust removal cyclone, and the calculated temperature of
this exhaust air is calculated to be approximately 50 °C.
If the exhaust air is cooled down from 50 °C to 5 °C, 185 kW of heat energy could be
utilized. The optimal location of waste heat recovery would be from the channel after
the dust removal cyclone, as then the air has been purified of dust particles. The dust
cyclone is in the vicinity of the drier and its incoming air channels, which enables heat
transfer between these two flows with either a heat pump or with a direct heat transfer
liquid circulation. The amount of potentially recoverable heat energy would be enough
to satisfy the heating requirement in total if the temperature would be increased, which
would support the idea for utilizing a heat pump as shown in Table 5. Preliminary
investment proposals were calculated for both of these options for comparison.
OPTION 1 includes a heat pump installed in the same room as the drier and all of its
channels. The evaporator of the heat pump would be installed in the exhaust air
channel and the condenser in the incoming hot air channel. As there are very little
possibilities to route the channels differently compared to current layout because of
space constraints, it would be highly probable that the different parts of the heat pump
would have to be installed apart from each other, which most likely would make it
more difficult to find a suitable heat pump for this application.

The heat pump is expected to provide the heat energy in a temperature of 95 °C, which
would be sufficient to enable hot air to be fed into the drier at 85 °C. The existing airwater heat exchanger would be demolished, but the air-steam heat exchanger would
remain in the channel as an additional or optional heat exchange unit.

The value for COPth is quite moderate and the value for COPel is slightly lower than

so the possibility of finding a heat pump with a desired level of COPel > 3 is realistic.

57

OPTION 2 for D1 would be to carry out heat transfer with a liquid circulation between
the exhaust air and incoming hot air channels. This option has been calculated in a
simplified scheme, where the temperature of the water circulation is always either 10
°C above or below the air temperature on the other side of each heat exchanger. A heat
exchanger would have to installed in the exhaust air channel, but at the incoming air
side, the same heat exchanger that is currently utilized for pre-heating the air with
water could be utilized in this option. A water or other heat transfer liquid circulation
loop with a circulation pump would be routed between these two heat exchangers.
The temperature difference over the current air-water heat exchanger is not known, but
with assumptions for the operation of this option presented in Table 6, a total of
approximately 10,700 € could be saved from steam costs annually. In the current
operation, the water in the air-water heat exchanger is also heated with steam, hence
the savings in steam expenses when this water would be replaced with an internal
circulation containing waste heat energy. The temperature of the incoming air in this
scenario is expected to be 5 °C, and it would be heated up to 30 °C with the water
circulation, and to 85 °C with the existing steam heat exchanger.

circulation. The table shows each streams’ initial temperature T0 and target temperature T1 as

The water circulation temperature would change between 15 °C and 40 °C, and based
on the temperature change and amount of waste heat energy available, the circulation
volume flow would be 5.1 m3/h. With an estimated pressure difference of 300 kPa, the
circulation pump would require a power of 0.5 kW for its operation.

The payback times for both of these options are on an economically feasible level. The
potential savings, heat transfer efficiency and investment costs go hand in hand in these
options so choosing between these options will require a comprehensive evaluation
process.

4.1.2.2 DRIER D3
The amount of air fed into drier D3 varies depending on which product it is drying,
but the temperatures remain the same. D3 utilizes dried cold air in a temperature of
approximately 20 °C and hot air in a temperature of 110 °C. All of the air is taken into
the process with a unified channel and heated up with a dT 5 °C from ambient
temperature, which in this calculation was assumed to be 5 °C. The air is filtrated and
divided into hot and cold air in their individual channels. The hot air is heated up with
steam, and also the pre-heating of the whole air intake utilizes steam in its heat
exchanger. With Product 1, approximately 3,040 m3/h of cold air and 4,000 m3/h of
hot air is required in the drier. For Product 3, these figures are 1,600 m3/h and 1,200
m3/h, respectively. The drier is operated in a sequential mode, which means that when
there is no product to be dried, the air inflow will decrease significantly to
approximately 30 % flows.
The exhaust air from D3 goes through a dust removal cyclone and into a wet scrubber.
The exhaust air exits from the dust cyclone and the temperature is assumed to be
relatively low in this exhaust air because of the steps of dust removal and because of
the relatively long distances between the dust removal equipment and the drier.
Because of the constraints from the temperature and the distance, the waste heat

59

recovery is proposed to be taken from the exhaust air before it is removed from dust.
This is not the optimal location to install a heat exchanger because of potential hygienic
and operational risks caused by the dust particles, so careful evaluation of the risk to
benefit ratio would be required, as well as determining the required cleaning and
inspection equipment for this heat exchanger in order to ensure safe and clean
operation.
The temperature of the dust containing exhaust air from D3 is calculated to be
approximately 60 °C, and if the temperature of the exhaust air from D3 would be
decreased to 10 °C, a total of 111 kW of waste heat energy could be recovered when
Product 1 is dried with this drier. The pre-heating of the total air flow requires 11 kW
and the heating of the hot air flow requires 121 kW, so the waste heat energy is not
sufficient to satisfy all of the energy needed for heating up hot air. Because steam is
required in any case as a hot utility, a heat pump is not thought to be a viable option
for this waste heat recovery and instead a water circulation similar to that of the other
dried D1 is proposed as a means to recover waste heat from the exhaust air and utilize
it to heat up the total air intake as well as heat up the hot air from 10 °C to 40 °C. These
heat exchange unit operations are presented in Table 7.

proposed operational models

Existing heat exchangers could be utilized in both pre-heating of total air intake and
pre-heating of hot air. A new heat exchanger could be installed in the exhaust air
channel in the vicinity of the air intake channels, and a water circulation with a
circulation pump would be routed in between these devices. To estimate the amount

60

of flow in the water circulation, the water temperature is assumed to vary between 15
°C and 50 °C, always remaining 10 °C above or below the air temperature on the other
side of each heat exchanger. Based on these temperatures and the heat load from waste
heat, the amount of flow in the water circulation can be calculated to 2.2 m3/h. With a
pressure difference of 300 kPa, the circulation pump would require 0.2 kW of power
for operation.

The payback time for this investment proposal is calculated based on above-mentioned
preliminary estimations on investment costs and potential savings and the payback
time appears to be relatively short making this proposal economically feasible.
However, as the proposed point of heat recovery from the exhaust air channel is not
ideal, the technical feasibility should be carefully considered when making a decision
about whether to carry on with this investment proposal.

4.1.3

EVAPORATOR

SECONDARY STEAM ENERGY UTILIZATION TO CENTRAL

HEATING OF PROPERTIES

The central heating network to heat up the properties is utilizing steam to heat up the
water circulating in the radiators. Coupled into this network is a heat exchanger HE1237, that used secondary steam from an evaporator instead of steam, but this heat
exchanger is no longer in use as the evaporator it is coupled into is no longer operated.
However, there is another evaporator whose secondary steam could be utilized,
reducing the steam expenses significantly in the central heating.
The amount of secondary steam available from this evaporator is approximately 1,800
kg/h, and an additional flow condensate expansion steam 290 kg/h is also directed into

61

this same pipeline. The temperature of this flow is not known, but according to surface
temperature measurements, it is approximately 70 °C. Currently this flow is condensed
with a surface condenser, thus, creating a vacuum in the evaporator. This phase change
alone releases 1,315 kW of energy.
According to measurements made in February, there is a flow of 67,000 kg/h in the
central heating network, and the heating demands are dependent on outside
temperatures. In this proposal, a temperature difference dT of 10 °C was utilized for
the water flow in the central heating network. 8 °C of this temperature difference
would be satisfied by the energy in the secondary steam, and the remaining 2 °C would
be heated with steam, as shown in Table 8. This dT would not cause the secondary
steam to condense, as it the energy released in this heat exchanger would be smaller
than what is needed for the phase change to occur. In addition, the potential savings
from steam were calculated in such a way that the evaporator would not be used 20%
of the time and steam would be required to satisfy the total heating demand.

The potentials for savings from steam expenses are quite significant; with this
calculation, a total of 152,300 € could be saved annually when this operational model
is in use when the factory is in production. However, this calculation does not take into
consideration the seasonal changes in the central heating demands. This calculation is
based on the heating demand measured during February, so naturally the heating
demand decreases with increased ambient temperatures.
In order to utilize the secondary and expansion steams from the evaporator that is in
operation, the existing secondary steam lines from the old evaporator to heat exchanger
HE-1237 should be demolished and the heat exchanger should be relocated in an
empty location near the pipelines that are carrying the current flow of secondary steam
to the surface condenser. The pipelines would have to be slightly rerouted to the HE-

62

1237, both in the secondary steam side as well as in the central heating water
circulation side. Because of the relatively big pipeline sizes on both sides, the costs for
mechanical works would be quite significant, but on the other hand, no equipment
purchases are necessary. The HE-1237 heat exchanger is expected to be in good
condition, but it should be inspected before commissioning.

The payback time for this investment proposal is very short making this investment

proposal.

4.1.4

HEAT RECOVERY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL COOLING WATER STREAM

There are currently two parallel tanks where Process Stream 18 is cooled down with
an individual Cooling Water stream 1. This cooling is currently carried out with the
plant’s cooling water system, but as this is an individual circulation of water that is
flowing in the mantle of the tanks, it could be possible to recover the heat energy to a
cold process stream. Such a stream is for example the intake of Raw Material 2, which
is taken in to the process in an estimated average temperature of 5 °C.
The cooling water circulation (CWS1) has an estimated flow of 3.5 m3/h and it needs
to be cooled down from 75 °C to approximately 40 °C, resulting in a cooling demand
of 138 kW. The intake of RM2 is divided to two different destinations in the process
with flowrates of 0.4 m3/h and 2.7 m3/h. With a combined flowrate of 3.1 m3/h, the
intake of RM2 could be heated up to approximately 38 °C with heat transfer from
CWS1, as shown in Table 9.

Although this is not enough to replace steam utilization in heating of RM1 in its
entirety, it would be able to decrease it in following process steps. In these following
steps, the RM1 is mixed into other flows before increasing the temperature, so the
benefits from the increased temperature of RM1 will have to be evaluated based on the
increased initial temperature of these combined streams. Table 10 presents the current
situation for these combined streams as well as how the initial temperature would be
increased with this proposed waste heat recovery.

In addition to savings from steam expenses, there is a possibility to obtain savings
from reducing the volume flow in the plant’s cooling water network. If the amount of
water that is pumped from the sea to the cooling water system is reduced, the electricity
the cooling water pump requires for its operation will decrease.

Based on these calculations, the current electricity consumption in approximately

be approximately 12,100 €/a.
This waste heat recovery could be carried out with an additional heat exchanger, which
could be located in the same room as the equipment that are currently cooling down
the process tanks. The pipeline that is used to take in RM2 is also already routed in
that same room, so only a moderate amount of new piping is required to route the
cooling water from the existing circulation to a new heat exchanger, and return it to
the same location. The existing heat exchangers in each tank’s cooling circulation
would remain in operation, as the intake of RM2 is non-continuous and there might be
a need to utilize the existing equipment as a backup or to accomplish additional
cooling.

With a payback time of 3.4 years, this investment proposal appears to still be within

are not taken into consideration, the payback time naturally increases to 4.6 years,
which is close to being economically unfeasible.

4.1.5

WASTE HEAT RECOVERY FROM COOLING WATER WITH A HEAT PUMP

As mentioned before, a relatively low temperature is common to most of the waste
heat sources found in Finnfeeds Finland Naantali processes. These relatively low
temperature sources are tough to utilize as such, as most of the streams requiring
heating must be heated into a relatively high temperature. The waste heat from low
temperature sources can be utilized in these heat sinks with the help of a heat pump,
and in this thesis, the waste heat source is proposed to be the cooling water system,

65

which utilizes sea water and returns it back to the sea in an elevated temperature. Even
though the temperature in this stream is low, approximately 10…20 °C, it contains a
large amount of energy because of its large flow, 350 m3/h on average.
Another option would be to directly recover waste heat by condensing secondary
steams from crystallization or evaporation, as these are the biggest unit processes to
create a large amount of waste heat. All of this energy is now gathered into the cooling
water in a low temperature, but obtaining the energy directly from the secondary steam
would provide for a higher temperature in the recovered waste heat. This could be
executed either directly or with a heat pump, and the waste heat sink should also be a
hot water circulation with a properly dimensioned buffer tank. As all of the
crystallization unit operations are operated batch-wise, this would mean that also the
waste heat source would not be continuous, but the waste heat sink could be operated
continuously if the hot water in it would be stored in a buffer tank. A comparison of
the advantages and disadvantages of these two options are presented in Table 11.

Besides these two options, it could also be possible to gather energy from multiple
sources into a same heat sink, thus, stabilizing the amount of waste heat energy

66

provided to the circulation. However, this would require multiple heat pumps which
would increase both the investment and operational costs.
The amount of waste heat energy recovered from the cooling water returning from the
processes is estimated with an average flow of 350 m3/h and by decreasing the
temperature in it from 15 °C to 7 °C, thus, releasing approximately 3 MW of energy.
This could be recovered with a heat pump and used to heat up a hot water circulation
to a temperature of 90 °C. The hot water circulation would be used in internal heating
demands, and the surplus of energy could be sold to district heating. After all of these
internal and external uses, the temperature in the hot water circulation would have
decreased to 60 °C as it returns to the heat pump. The amount of flow in the hot water
circulation, as well as the amount of hot water provided into the district heating
network, were calculated based on the chosen temperature differences and heat loads.
The basic principle of this proposed waste heat recovery and utilization is illustrated
in Figure 26.

Figure 26 An illustration of the basic principle for the heat pump investment proposal with
internal and external utilization.

Internal uses are listed in Table 12. T0 is the initial temperature of the flow and Ttarget
is the target temperature determined by process requirements. As it is not possible to

67

increase the temperature as high as Ttarget in all of these uses, T1 illustrates the
temperature reached with heat transfer from the hot water circulation.
Approximately half of these flows could utilize their existing heat exchangers if the
hot water circulation would be routed to these locations, replacing steam usage in its
entirety. The other half would require new heat exchangers to be purchased and
installed in the vicinity of the current locations of these flows. A few of these flows
would still require additional heating with steam by their existing heat transfer
equipment.
Some of these flows are continuous, but some are operated occasionally based on what
product is being made in the processes. This leads to the amount of internally used
energy variating according to production demands, but the heat pump could
nevertheless be operated in a stable manner, as the amount of heat energy provided to
district heating could fluctuate. The controllability of a heat pump works on a relatively
narrow range, so adjusting the amount going to district heating according to internal
demands would prevent problems arising from unstable operation of heat pump.

The pipeline for cooling water that returns from the process flows through the facility
floors and the heat pump and its auxiliary equipment should be located in the vicinity
of this existing route. By demolishing an existing old CIP tank and replacing it with
pipelines from another CIP tank, and relocating a pump as well as some pipelines, a

68

clear space could be generated right next the cooling water pipeline. The costs for these
demolitions and replacements are considered in the investment proposal.
The prices for all of the equipment that are proposed to be purchased are calculated
based on AFRY’s price database. The sizes of the pumps are estimated based on
preliminary evaluations for pressure differences. The power of the hot water
circulation pump is estimated to be 20 kW and the power of the district heating pump
is estimated to be either 10 kW or 19 kW depending on the coupling point. In addition
to heat exchangers and pumps, the hot water circulation should have at least a small
expansion tank, even though there would not be a demand for a bigger buffer tank in
the circulation.
Implementing this waste heat recovery would generate significant savings from steam
expenses. The amount of the savings can, in a simplified manner, be calculated directly
from the sum of the internal heat loads listed above in Table 12. However, as all of
these flows and their heat exchangers are not in continuous operation, the estimate for
steam savings should be evaluated by taking into consideration an evaluation on the
annual production plans for each product, which affects directly to the operation of
each heat exchanger. The difference of these two ways to evaluate steam savings is
approximately 20,000 €/a. The savings from steam are estimated based on the
production plan when calculating the payback time for this investment proposal.
There are two alternative options for the location where the water provided to district
heating could be coupled into, and both of these options are taken into consideration
in the investment calculations. Cooperation with a district heating company is
presented further in Chapter 4.2.

As the temperature of the waste heat (cooling water) provided for the heat pump’s
evaporator, and the temperature of the hot water leaving the heat pump’s condenser
differ significantly from each other, COPth remains relatively low:

𝐶𝑂𝑃𝑡ℎ =

𝑇1
273 °C + 90 °C
363 K
=
=
= 4.8
𝑇1 − 𝑇0 (273 °C + 90 °C) − (273 °C + 15 °C) 363 K − 288 K

COPel can be calculated based on the estimated electricity consumption of the heat
pump, and also this value is not as high as it should be:

𝐶𝑂𝑃𝑒𝑙 =

𝑄̇ 1
3 MW
=
= 2.9
𝑊𝑒𝑙 1.1 MW

As these calculations are based on estimations and not calculated for a specific heat
pump or its properties, COPel > 3 should be well within reach for this application.
If there is no interest in cooperating with a district heating company by providing
excess waste heat energy to their district heating system, a smaller heat pump would
suffice for internal use. With similar additions, modifications and estimations, the
principle of this smaller 1 MW heat pump would be as illustrated in Figure 27.

This investment would require a significantly smaller investment, but there would be
no additional income from district heating and the whole waste heat energy potential
in the cooling water would not be utilized.

The payback time for the options including district heating is relatively long and not
necessarily within the traditional limits of economic feasibility. The feasibility of an
energy efficiency investment is not solely reliant on the duration of the payback time,
so this preliminary investment proposal should be considered whether it would be
otherwise viable and there would be willingness for such new cooperation. To improve
its feasibility, more internal utilization should be incorporated to the same hot water
circulation, thus, increasing also the size of the heat pump. The same approach could
also be applied to the option for internal use only, as increasing the utilization of the
energy in the hot water circulation would create more savings from steam consumption
and decrease the investment’s payback time.

71

The internal process streams chosen to be implemented in this investment proposal
were chosen based on their temperature profiles, volume flows, and current location
in the process. More streams that could be coupled into a hot water circulation can be
found from the Naantali plant, so in order of finding the ideal approach for a heat pump
investment, the places where the energy would be utilized would have to be carefully
chosen in order to determine the ideal amount of heat recovery.

4.2 EXTERNAL UTILIZATION AS DISTRICT HEAT
The possibility of delivering waste heat to the district heating system was preliminarily
examined in this case study. The district heating system of the city of Naantali is in the
near proximity of the Finnfeeds Finland Co. plant, and the prerequisites for supplying
heat energy into this network was examined in cooperation with both Turku Energia
Co. and Turun Seudun Energiantuotanto Co. They have a long history with similar
waste heat cooperation with external parties dating back to the 1990s, and were
interested in this possibility of finding a mutually beneficial operational model.
As it has been previously mentioned, the amount of waste heat produced in the
Finnfeeds Finland Naantali plant’s processes are heavily dependable on the production
plans and production phases. Different alternatives of waste heat sources were
discussed with Turku Energia and Turun Seudun Energiantuotanto, including
secondary steam and cooling water.
It was concluded that most probably the most effective and effortless way for this
cooperation would be achieved with an individual water flow provided with an indirect
coupling to the network, and this water flow would be heated to a sufficient
temperature by the waste heat source. This is not necessarily the advisable way to
couple a waste heat source to the district heating network, as the coupling should
always be conducted indirectly in order to avoid potential impurities in the network
water. The equipment (heat pump, heat exchanger, and pump) and piping necessary
for this coupling would be owned, operated and maintained by Finnfeeds Finland.

72

In the preliminary discussions, a couple of alternative coupling points to the network
were identified and the design values for these points were determined. The
temperature of the supplied water is dependable on ambient temperature and the
pressure in both of these points were approximately either 250 kPa or 450 kPa. The
first option would be a point from where district heating goes to the centre of Naantali.
This location is approximately 500 meters from the Finnfeeds Finland plant, it has a
lower pressure in the network and the heat load provided by Finnfeeds Finland would
be utilized relatively quickly so there would not be any significant heat losses caused
by long distances. The other option for a possible coupling point is in the vicinity of
the power plant which is the primary heat source to the district heating. This point is
approximately 1.2 km from the Finnfeeds Finland plant and has a larger pressure in
the network, but the estimated supply temperature of approximately 80 °C would better
dissipate to the network in cold ambient temperatures.
As the amount of heat energy that could be provided to the district heating system by
Finnfeeds Finland is relatively small compared to the total energy in the network,
especially during high demand operation, its varying nature would not cause problems
in the network operation and there would not be a need to operate this district heating
coupling with a strictly steady heat flow. The preliminary estimated temperature of 80
°C was estimated to be sufficient until ambient temperature decreases to a few degrees
Celsius below zero, but a higher supply temperature would be desirable during colder
weather, especially if the coupling point would be located in the first option.
The demand for district heating is heavily dependable on outside temperature, which
means that there are also great seasonal differences. The district heating network
supply temperature must be higher during winter and the demand for the heating is
significantly higher then, and this also reflects to the prices the district heating
company would be willing to pay for waste heat. If sufficient supply temperature is
not met, the price of the waste heat provided to the district heating is lower. The
investment calculations were calculated with average prices taking into account the
seasonal changes.

73

5 CONCLUSIONS
The relatively low temperature of different waste heat sources as well as their
relatively varying production rates complicates the efficient utilization of this heat
energy, especially as there are both continuous and batch-wise unit processes and heat
energy demands in the Finnfeeds Finland Co. Naantali factory.
Heat storage would be necessary to stabilize the supply of waste heat energy to heat
sinks, but the low temperature in the sources causes storage as such to be inefficient
and pointless. The temperature would have to be increased prior to storing in order to
provide the heat energy in a temperature that would be sufficient for multiple
utilizations and that would be able to heat up process streams to a relatively high
temperature. Without a sufficient temperature level, the investment costs are expected
to be too high compared to the profits obtained from this heat recovery.
The relatively low temperature of waste heat sources also prohibits the use of internal
electricity production with Organic Rankine Cycle, as no sufficiently high (both in
terms of temperature and flow) waste heat sources were identified.
The applicable means for heat recovery with these waste heat sources are heat
exchangers and increasing the temperature with a heat pump prior to utilization. The
aforementioned investment proposals were sketched up to provide alternatives for heat
recovery and to reduce the amount of heat exchangers that are operated over the Pinch
point in different scenarios. The investment proposals aimed at reduction of steam
utilization as well as increase of process integration in suitable targets to improve
energy efficiency and waste heat utilization. Scenario 1 included the most of such heat
exchangers (16 out of 50) and out of these heat exchangers, 9 are included in the
investment proposals for waste heat utilization. As 16 out of 50 heat exchangers
represented 37% of the heat energy demands in Scenario 1, these 9 heat exchangers
included in the preliminary investment proposals would be able to change into waste
heat instead of steam as an energy source, this waste heat recovery representing
approximately 9% of the scenarios heating and cooling demands. However, some of
them would still be operated over the Pinch point if these investment proposals would
be implemented, as they would be included in a hot water circulation creating a

74

situation where the heat transfer media would be on the wrong side of the Pinch point
compared to the heat sink. For scenarios 2 and 3, the number of heat exchangers that
are currently operated over the Pinch point and that are included in the investment
proposals are 1 and 3, respectively.
The payback times for the preliminary investment proposals were quite varying, but
the payback time is not the only criteria to evaluate an investment’s feasibility,
especially with energy efficiency investments. Utilization of waste heat provides the
factory means to improve their sustainability with increased energy efficiency. All of
these preliminary proposals should be assessed in relation to one another in order to
determine whether or not they could be implemented and in which order. Especially
the ones with short payback times (such as the waste heat recovery to central heating)
or significant potential (waste heat recovery with a heat pump) are advised to be
prioritized in the potential implementation order. Additionally, any means for process
integration and simultaneous reduction in steam expenses are strongly advised,
especially by implementing heat recovery technologies to the heating of raw material
flows.
While studying the materials and interviewing Finnfeeds Finland personnel it became
clear that there are limited means of monitoring energy consumption, especially in
individual equipment. There are relatively few measurements for flow or temperature
which complicated the compiling of initial data for this survey but also makes it more
difficult or even impossible for operators to monitor and adjust the process according
to energy effectiveness when the process allows it. There is a tradition of thorough and
regular monitoring and reporting of total energy consumption, but that is carried out
from history data. The most effective ways to affect to energy effectivity in the process
is by adjusting it in real time instead of making corrective actions afterwards. Adding
measurements especially in suitable locations especially in the unit operations
requiring significant amount of heating or cooling would be a relatively easy way to
improve both the understanding of where energy is consumed and perhaps even adjust
it if the production process allows it.
As the energy consumption is not that known in detail, neither is the real-time
quantities of waste heat released from the process. There are measurements and means

75

to monitor some sources of waste heat, but these apply mainly to the already identified
largest sources such as cooling water, secondary steam or waste water. Additional
measurements for such waste heat sources which have varying natures in terms of
temperature and flow are recommended prior to making decisions about heat recovery
investments, as these investment proposals in this thesis are based on the initial data
that was available. They are simplifications of the process as the calculations are
carried out with one exemplary situation instead of carrying out simulations to
determine the typical ranges of each proposal.

6 SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
UNDERSÖKNING

AV

SPILLVÄRMEKÄLLOR

OCH

DERAS

ANVÄNDNING

I

PROCESSINDUSTRIN

Varje gång mekaniskt arbete utförs i någon process, är det oundvikligt att den primära
energin som matas in i processen inte kan utnyttjas fullt. Spillvärme är värmeenergi
som inte utnyttjades i processen, och den kan hittas från många olika källor inom
industrin. De flesta litteraturkällor definierar spillvärme som värmeenergin som
förloras för miljön, utan att ta ställning till denna energis temperatur eller om den kan
användas eller inte. Användningen av denna värmeenergi är dock mycket viktig för att
säkerställa en fabriks energieffektiva drift.
Förbättring av energieffektivitet är alltså en viktig del av olika nationella och
internationella strategier, till exempel Europeiska Unionens Green Deal och finska
statens strategi mot för ett klimatneutralt Finland 2035. Industriell produktion regleras
med direktiv och lagar och det är möjligt att få finansiella stöd till investeringar i
energieffektivitet. En ökning av den cirkulära ekonomiprincipen är gemensam för alla
strategierna och den betyder mera användning av spillvärme istället för att låta den gå
till spillo.
Spillvärme kan vara bunden i de olika flöden som lämnar en fabrik och sådana källor
kan kategoriseras enligt deras temperatur:
-

Temperatur under 50 °C
o till exempel kylningsvatten, kondensat från mekanisk kylning,
avgaslufter

-

Temperatur mellan 50 °C och 100 °C
o till exempel kylningsvatten, avlastningsgaser, kylningsolja från smorda
kompressorer

-

Temperatur över 100 °C
o till exempel rökgaser, varma avgaslufter

För att förbättra energieffektivitet i industri, är det viktigt att finna sätt att använda
spillvärme antingen internt eller externt. Teoretisk, teknisk och ekonomisk potential

77

måste definieras för varje spillvärmekälla när en lämplig värmesänka finns för
användningen. Interna sätt skulle vara primära sätt för användning, och först efter att
alla möjliga interna sätt har evaluerats, borde externa sätt studeras. Ett externt sätt att
använda spillvärme är säljning av spillvärme till fjärrvärme, vars genomförande
behöver samarbete med ett fjärrvärmeföretag.
Systematisk undersökning av spillvärmekällor kan utföras med Pinch-analys, som
använder enkla inmatningsdata i analysen. Initialvärden (start- och måltemperatur,
specifik värmekapacitet och massflöde) definieras för varje flöde som behöver värme
eller kyla, och från dessa initialvärden sammanställs en kurva som representerar alla
heta eller alla kalla flöden. De två kurvorna ritas i en graf som uttrycker temperatur
och förändringen i entalpi på sådant sätt att de aldrig överlappar och skiljer med
åtminstone Pinch-punkten (ΔTmin) från varandra. Baserat på analysen kan man
bestämma minimala behovet för heta och kalla bruksnyttigheter, jämföra nuvarande
situationen i fabriken med minimala behovet, och utforma värmeöverföringen så att
Pinch-punkten inte överskrids. Pinch-analysen ger också resultatet för den teoretiska
potentialen för värmeöverföring mellan heta och kalla flöden, vilken kan används att
förbättra energieffektivitet och intern användning av spillvärme.
Sätt för användning av spillvärme kan kategoriseras i passiva och aktiva sätt baserat
om temperaturen hålls på samma nivå eller om den ändras. Interna sätt att använda
spillvärme är till exempel användning som sådan, värmeöverföring med värmeväxlare
eller värmelagring. Värmeöverföring baserar sig på samma principer som med
traditionella källor: enligt termodynamiska lagar kan värmeenergi överföras och
överföring sker alltid från högre till lägre temperatur. Värmelagring kan utföras på
olika sätt, enklast med lagring av energin i vatten i en behållare av lämplig storlek,
men också med användning av värmeenergin för att växla lagringsmaterialens
tillstånd. Värmelagring kan också utföras med termokemisk lagring, var energin lagras
som resultat av en kemisk reaktion i lagringsmaterial.
Aktiva sätt att använda spillvärme ändrar temperaturen eller växlar värmeenergin till
en annan form av energi, till exempel till elektrisk energi. Det mest använda sättet är
ökning av temperatur med en värmepump. Det finns många olika tekniker för
värmepumpning, antingen med öppen eller stängd cykel, eller antingen mekanisk eller

78

termisk drift, vilket betyder att extern energi i form av elektricitet eller till exempel
ånga behövs när värmepumpen används. Användnings-principen för värmepumpar
baserar sig på kylmedlets kokpunkts tryckberoende. Alla värmepumpar är planerade
individuellt för varje användning. För att stödja investeringsbeslut, kan koefficienter
för energieffektivitet (EER) och utförandet (COP) räknas för att bestämma hur
användbar en värmepump är vid en specifik användningsplats.
Organic Rankine Cycle eller ORC är ett sätt att omvandla värmeenergi till elektrisk
energi,

och

det

kan

använda

även

100

°C

spillvärme

till

småskalig

elektricitetsproduktion. ORC använder också ett kylmedel som är evaporerad med
energin från spillvärme innan det förgasade kylmedlet går till turbinen. Turbinen
återhämtar mekanisk energi när den förgasade fluiden expanderas till ett minskat tryck.
Den mekaniska energin omvandlas till elektricitet och kondensation av kylmedlet ger
ut värmeenergin till en lämplig värmesänka.
Målsättningen med det här diplomarbeten var att göra en undersökning av alla olika
spillvärmekällor i processer i Finnfeeds Finland Oy Naantali fabrik, och hitta sätt att
utnyttja denna energi både internt och externt. Undersökningen började med flera
intervjuer och bekantgörande av materialet som beskriver den nuvarande situationen i
fabriken. Massbalanser, produktionsplaner, processdata och mätningar användes för
att utgöra energibalanser till de olika avdelningarna i fabriken. Energibalansen
används för att utföra Pinch-analys med Aspen HYSYS Energy Analyzer för tre olika
produktionsscenarier. Fabrikens nuvarande användning av bruksnyttigheter räknades
med värden från rapporter eller mätningar, och jämförelse med Pinch-analysresultat
upptäcker att fabriken använder mera heta och kalla bruksnyttigheter än vad är
nödvändigt.
Alla fabrikens värmeöverväxlare gicks igenom för att bestämma om de opererar
antingen över Pinch-punkten eller under den. I olika scenarier, överskrider följande
antal av värmeöverväxlare Pinch-punkten: 16 av 50, 9 av 46 och 9 av 46. I alla
scenarierna var området för värmeöverföring mellan heta och kalla flöden ganska
smalt, och det finns mycket mera flöden som behöver upphettning än vad det finns
flöden som behöver kylning. Det betyder att det finns många olika spillvärmekällor i
processen men också att temperaturen av spillvärmen inte nödvändigtvis är tillräckligt

79

hög för användning av spillvärmen som sådan. För mer effektiv användning, måste
temperaturen ökas till exempel med en värmepump.
De större källorna av spillvärme var kylningsvatten, avloppsvatten, och olika
avgaslufter. Alla källor förenas av att de har en relativt låg temperatur och
energiinnehållen varierar beroende av produktion. Mängden av spillvärmeflöden kan
variera kraftigt, särskilt i avloppsvatten.
Fem olika investeringsförslag var skisserade för att använda spillvärme. Alla förslag
ska minska användning av ånga, eftersom de alla använder spillvärme för att hetta upp
råmaterialen. Förslagen innehåller sådana som använder ett processflöde för att hetta
upp ett råmaterial, sådana som använder avgasluft att hetta upp inkommande luft, och
ett större förslag som använder spillvärme från kylningsvatten och kräver en
värmepump för att öka temperaturen. Det här heta flöde används för att hetta upp olika
interna flöden såväl som erbjuda värmeenergi som fjärrvärme. Enkla beräkningar av
värmeöverföringen och flödesscheman gjordes för varje förslag, såväl som enkla
beräkningar av de förändringar som krävs och utrustningen som ska köpas för att
implementera varje investeringsförslag. Baserat på de här beräkningarna och
potentiella besparingar från ångkostnader, räknades återbetalningstider för att evaluera
ekonomisk potential av varje förslag.
