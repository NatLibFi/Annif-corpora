ABSTRAKT
Det finns många existerande verktyg för att beräkna ett företags koldioxidutsläpp.
Tyvärr är de flesta av dessa för komplicerade, alltför förenklade för att vara tillförlitliga
eller finns endast tillgängliga hos konsulter. Detta medför att många företag inte har
tid eller råd att göra utsläppsberäkningar som fler och fler konsumenter efterfrågar.
Syftet med denna studie var att skapa teoretiska formler och riktlinjer för
utsläppsberäkningar som kan användas för att strukturera en giltig greenhouse gasrapport, och som senare kommer användas i utvecklingen av en beräkningsapplikation.
De två områdena som fokuseras på är en produktlivscykel och tjänster så som en
hotellövernattning. Likheter hittades mellan de två områdena nämligen utsläpp som
orsakas av transporter och avfall. En life cycle analysis-databas skapades av redan
existerande data. Life cycle analysis-databasen, formler och stöddokument
konstruerades för att hjälpa användaren att göra en utsläppsberäkning. Med dessa
hjälpmedel kan de flesta utsläppsberäkningar göras på en dag.
Nyckelord: Växthusgaser, LCA, CO2-utsläpp

ABSTRACT
Calculation tools to help a company estimate their product or service emissions exist.
Unfortunately, most of these are complicated, too simplified to be reliable or kept only
for use of consultants. This creates a large group of companies that do not have the
time or the money to create emission reports which more and more consumers are
requesting. This study is done to form the theory behind emission calculations as well
as to serve as an example of showing that simplified formulas and rules can be made
to create a valid GHG report to show to consumers or suppliers, which later can be
used in the development of an emission calculation application. The two focus areas
are products and their life cycle as well as services provided, for example, a night’s
stay at a hotel. Some similarities were found between them, namely in transport, waste,
and vehicle emissions. To achieve this an LCA database was composed from already
publicly available data. With the LCA database, formulas and helping text the emission
calculations can be done in a day.
Key words: Greenhouse gas, LCA, Emissions

INTRODUCTION

The pressure of low carbon emissions increases for each passing day, as Finland
pushes to be carbon neutral by 2035 (Bergman, 2021). The first step to complete is to
calculate emissions to see which parts in a business have the highest emissions and
which parts can have their emissions reduced. This can be achieved with a life cycle
assessment (LCA).
LCA calculations are not an exact science. It includes many different aspects that are
not feasible to be measured or cannot be measured. Estimations must be made to finish
the report. Another part that reduced the precision of the report is that all emissions
that emit less than 1% of the total emissions are considered too small to be considered
in the report (Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 2011). This is acceptable as the LCA
calculations are inherently a way to let producers know which parts that have the
largest emissions and, therefore, can focus their resources.
As a standard, the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol reporting uses GWP and GTP of
100 years in the atmosphere. This shows how large an impact on warming and
temperature increases a certain greenhouse gas has over the period of a 100 years.
The main goal of this thesis was to assess if the reporting standards given from GHG
Protocol, Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard (Greenhouse Gas
Protocol, 2011) could be simplified so anyone could create a report using an app,
while still being credible, within a reasonable timeframe, to allow small and medium
companies to evaluate their products’ entire emission through its lifetime. To further
simplify. The company Black Label Bytes is developing an application and tool to
guide the users through the steps of doing greenhouse gas emission calculations and
then have the tool create a report from given data and calculations. The usage for
such a report is to show customers how much the product they buy affect global
warming, and for producers to see their products emissions, creating reduction goals
or to follow progress. The product is aimed at small to medium companies that
cannot afford to hire consultants to do the calculations nor have the time to try and
do them themselves. This affects several parts in the work performed.

2

The aim of this thesis part in the development of the application is to help the
developers create a reliable product that follows the GHG protocol guidelines without
being too complex for the everyday user. No programing was performed during this
thesis as it is made to create a starting development point for the application. The focus
of this study will be on products and services and not the entire companies’ emissions.
Reasoning for this is that the company can show their customers how much emissions
comes with their choices. As this is requested more and more.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Books, articles, and reports were studied to get a larger understanding of the subject
as well as LCA. Several of these were not directly relevant to this thesis but are
considered good background knowledge. GHG protocol have several well documented
articles and journals that became the starting point for understanding the requirements
needed.
2.1

GHG REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

The list of requirements is long and doubles in length if all optional information is
used. The first points are general information about company name, address etc.
Boundary settings is the following, which covers stage definitions and descriptions,
process maps, time period, and excluded processes. Allocation defines if any processes
apply to other companies and are, therefore, not directly connected to these process
emissions. Inventory results covers the emission results, global warming potential
(GWP) factors and the life cycle stages separately. Hundred year values for GWP and
global temperature potential (GTP) are required to be used in GHG reporting
standards. Additionally, the report needs to include how the data were collected, the
uncertainty with the collected values and assurance statements. Assurance statements
includes if the report was made by first or third party, relevant competencies, and the
level of assurance. There is also additional optional information that can be included
in the report, some data to give higher assurance and others if they are included in the
calculations (Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 2011).
GTP will not directly be used in calculations, as it is only a report requirement that
shows how much certain emissions could potentially raise the global temperature if
not absorbed. GWP will be the resulting unit, after calculations are done, in the form
of 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒.

4
2.2

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

According to Greenhouse Gas Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 2011) there is also
the possibility to exclude processes. If a process is excluded from the GHG report, it
needs to be explained why. Acceptable reasons are if the total emission is lower than
1% of total emissions and the entire Gate-to-Grave part of the inventory can be
excluded, if the company produces a product that is not going to the end user and is
instead used to create another product.
Other pieces of additional information contain sources for the calculation’s values. If
using the given proxy values, the application will provide the sources.
The same goes for emission removals. Emissions that are captured and removed before
released in the atmosphere shall be recorded in amount. Biogenic and non-biogenic
removals shall be reported separately.
2.3

LCA DATABASES

After search for functional LCA databases, two were found that could be used. One
from United Kingdom and the other from United States of America. Both databases
use a system where it calculates emission depending on money spent by the producer.
During further study, it became clear that the database that was calculated in the UK
was from 2011 and support for the document has been dropped, even the webpage
given in the excel file has been rebranded and, therefore, it will not be used. The other
database is from the USA (Ingwersen & Li, 2020) and is the one that will be used at
the start of the applications development, as it is not copyright protected for
commercial use, contains numbers from 2016 which are acceptable and does have
separate values for 𝐶𝑂2, 𝐶𝐻4 , 𝑁2 𝑂 and a column for all lesser greenhouse gases given
as 𝐶𝑂2 𝑒. The splitting of different gases is a good addition, since it improves reliability
in the GHG report, with addition of using newer GWP values for the gases.
Some changes needed to be done to the database before use, namely that it needed to
be adapted to the value of euro in the year 2021 as it is the year of writing, and then
calculate the total emissions in 𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 as that is the grounded unit for these reports.

5

Applying these changes creates, what is referred to as, proxy data. This proxy data is
an estimation that helps several parts of the emission calculation by reducing number
of calculation steps and data collection.
2.4

LCA & GHG DIFFERENCES

LCA and GHG differs slightly in the way that LCA is more inclusive and looks at
smaller details. An LCA can contain particles in the air, its effect on water climate and
health impacts (DANTES project, 2006).
In comparison a GHG report only contains greenhouse gas emissions and its global
temperature impact (World Resource Institute, 2001). GHG reports are mostly used as
a marketing tool and to help businesses take control over their emissions, while LCA
looks at the emissions in their entirety.
2.5

SERVICES

Up to this point, all work has been focused on product life cycles but not on the service
industry, which is estimated to be around 70% in most countries (Gruber, Abosag,
Szmigin, & Reppel, 2011). Services do not have a direct GHG standard for how to
report.
Referencing the Guide to PAS 2050 (Carbon Trust, Defra, BSI, 2008), as it has service
examples in its appendix II, as well as the Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard (World Resource Institute, 2001).
2.6

CARBON STORAGE

Some materials store carbon even after waste handling. The most common is lignin in
wood (Ingerson, 2009) in landfills (Statens offentliga utredningar, 2020). These also
need to be accounted for in the report. Reading up on the subject reveals that only
some wooden products have a lifetime of a hundred years (Leys) and, therefore, no

6
carbon is left stored in the wood using the GWP and GTP 100-year. This, in itself,
means that carbon stored in products needs to be determined by the producer.
The science behind carbon storage is relatively new but can see a rise in coming years
(XPRIZE Foundation, 2021).
2.7

FUNCTIONAL UNIT

A functional unit refers to the unit that will be used as a summary of all emissions. It
will change drastically for different businesses but will almost always have 𝑔𝐶𝑂2 in
one form or the other. This unit might not be as summarizing in an LCA as for an GHG
report because of the waste focus differences of the two.
2.8

UNCERTAINTY

As stated, GHG calculations are merely and estimation and can vary depending on
country, electricity plan and businesses.
The proxy data generated from the LCA database is comparable to the United States
of America’s emissions for different products. These products are not far from
Finland’s product emissions and can therefore be used for testing and starting out.
Modern electricity companies now days offers at least one variety of contract that uses
some form of renewable energy and therefore instantly reduces your energy emissions.
Most energy companies do provide an emission report to their customers making it
simple to get these values.

METHODS

To further ease the calculations there will be use of proxy data that handles the earliest
stages of material acquisition and some non-consumable and consumable products.
This proxy data needs to be translated, as it is currently in 2018 US dollar and the
needed currency is 2021 euro.
Another helpful tool to create LCA calculations is diagrams. A diagram for product
life cycles was drawn and is shown later in this chapter.
To establish formulas for product life cycles and for service emissions there needs to
be comparable data. One calculation was done to create the formulas, while the other
tested the formulas and applied eventual changes. A total of four calculations were
done, two for product life cycles and two for service emissions.
3.1

RECALCULATE EMISSION VALUES

To recalculate value of a 2018 US dollar to 2021 euro two values are needed. Firstly,
the exchange rate is needed and second the inflation value. Thereafter given the values
0.829047 2021 €/2018 USD, at the day of writing. As sources for finding such data,
two open access tools can be used; (Exchange Rates UK, 2018) database and
(inflationtool, 2021) calculator.

𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 2018 − 2021 = 3%
The emission GWP values used in this thesis are taken from Anthropogenic and
Natural Radiative Forcing (Myhre, o.a., 2013) which contains many lesser-known
greenhouse gases as well as the ones needed. The values are from 2013 but are still
precise when compared to newer published data. Having only one table to take from
improves reliability. As mentioned earlier, 100-year values are requested in GHG
reports. As stated, GTP and GWP needs to be reported. The following table shows the
most common greenhouse gases and their GWP and GTP. This table is used to

8
translate the most common occurring greenhouse gases to one combined unit 𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 for
easier understanding. 𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 means carbon dioxide equivalent, meaning that a certain
gas has the same impact as given amount of carbon dioxide.

LIFE CYCLE DIAGRAMS

A helpful tool to make LCA is a life cycle diagram. This will show all different points
that can generate emissions and which parts that should not be included in the report.
A generalized diagram was made for product life cycle (Figure 1). This diagram was
created to help users create their diagrams. A non-generalized product was considered,
and several different approaches were composed to one life cycle. Parts can be added
and removed from the diagram to apply to specific products.

9

Figure 1 Created life cycle diagram

A similar diagram was not drawn for services for two reasons. First, services do
technically not have a start or end of life, it is a continuous cycle. Second, services
vary almost entirely in some cases and, therefore, a life cycle diagram could confuse
users if included.

3.3

PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE CALCULATIONS

Two product life cycle calculations were performed. The first was assumed to be a
pottery that made a cup as one of their products. These calculations were done without
any information or knowledge of how to make LCA calculations. While the second
covered a bakery and their scones using formulas created from the first LCA
calculation.

3.3.1 Ceramic Cup
To achieve a better understanding of what data were needed to complete a variant of
GHG reporting, LCA calculations were needed. Envisioning a small pottery studio
wanted to do an LCA calculation for their ceramic coffee cups. To help create such

10
calculations, calculations found in Appendix III in the PSA2050 Guide (Carbon Trust,
Defra, BSI, 2008) was referenced to see processes and data needed.
The LCA calculations were partly left incomplete, as no Cradle-to-Gate was performed
for the glazing. This is not a necessity, as it would use the similar datapoints and path
as the clay.

3.3.2 Scones
As a follow-up test calculation, calculations for a bakery focusing on their scones
product was made following the established formulas in chapter 3.4.
The proxy data was used for these calculations as well which had a large impact on
the calculation time, as it reduced the Cradle-to-Gate calculations immensely. The
proxy data is using a system that takes the euro spent and transforms this to emissions.
For these calculations, the prices were taken from Finnish stores at the point of writing
for the needed product.
3.4

FORMULAS FOR PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE

Formulas were especially important in this thesis, as the actual programming work will
be done by other people in the company. All formulas were created from scratch with
some help from GHG Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard
(Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 2011) and PSA 2050 Guide (Carbon Trust, Defra, BSI,
2008).
Some calculations can use a unit that contains both weight and distance, for example
transportation, while others depend on what product is produced. For example,
producing a car will produce a unit of emission per one car, while anything that is more
bulk product can have emissions per ton product as a functional unit.
These formulas can and should be used several times for every transportation step or
if the product requires more than a single material to be produced.
The functional unit is one decided by the business making the calculations, and one
that makes sense in the context. For example, 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡, 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / ton

11

product, Or 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / production week.

3.4.1 Production Emissions
To calculate production emissions, the user can either calculate energy usage for each
machine used multiplied by the usage time (formula 1) or, if they only produce one
product, they can use the total energy usage from their electricity provider (formula
2). Both approaches need average emissions coefficient and products produced per
day.
Emission per Day (𝐸𝑑𝑎𝑦 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑑𝑎𝑦] is calculated using formula 1.
𝐸𝑑𝑎𝑦 = 𝐸𝑙𝑀 ∗ 𝑈𝑑 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙

(1)

Were:
Machinery Energy Usage (𝐸𝑙𝑀 ) [kW]
Usage Time per Day (𝑈𝑑 ) [h/day]
Emission Coefficient for Electricity (𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑘𝑊ℎ]
Total Energy Usage (𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 ) [kW] can also be used in some cases.
𝐸𝑑𝑎𝑦 = 𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙

(2)

Translating the unit to a collected unit requires a division of products per day or similar
ending unit (formula 3).
Production Emissions per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒑) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡]
𝑷𝑬𝒑 =

𝐸𝑑𝑎𝑦
𝑃𝐷

(3)

Were:
Products per Day (𝑃𝑑𝑎𝑦 ) [Products/day]

3.4.2 Work machines
Fossil fuel work machines are a large source of emission. Electrical or biogas work
machines are also a source of emission and can have a huge impact depending on the

12
usage time. Formula 4 covers fuel using work machines, either with biogas or fossil
fuels. Formula 5 covers all electrical work machines.
Work Machines Emissions per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒗 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] is calculated using
formula 4.
𝑷𝑬𝒗 = 𝐹 ∗ 𝑈 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝐹

(4)

Were:
Fuel Usage (𝐹) [𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡/ℎ]
Usage Time (U) [h]
Emission Coefficient for Fuel (𝑒𝑓𝐹 ) [h/day]
Work Machines Energy Usage (𝐸𝑙𝑉 ) [kW/h] is needed for electrical vehicles and
results in Work Machines Emissions per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒗 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡].
𝑷𝑬𝒗 = 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙 ∗ 𝐸𝑙𝑣

(5)

3.4.3 Waste Emissions
Garbage truck emissions can contain either both distance and weight (Formula 6) or
only distance (Formula 7). If only distance is used no weight parameters are needed,
which means that inbound will just add to distance travelled. There are also several
different types of waste management trucks, as waste can be liquid or solid.
Waste truck emission inbound may have less of an impact on waste transportation than
other transportation, so it could be ignored without impacting the final emission value
outside accepted ranges.
Waste Truck Emission Inbound (𝐸𝑖𝑛 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is calculating one way journey while
the waste truck is not fully loaded (Formula 6).
𝐸𝑖𝑛 = (𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∗ 𝑊𝑤 ) ∗ 𝐷𝑖𝑛 ∗ 𝐸𝑤𝑡
Were:
Percentage empty on inbound (𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) [%]
Waste Weight (𝑊𝑤 ) [kg]

(6)

13
Inbound Distance (𝐷𝑖𝑛 ) [km]
Waste Truck Emission (𝐸𝑤𝑡 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/km * kg]
Waste Truck Emission Outbound (𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is with full load in the following
formula.
𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸𝑤𝑡 ∗ 𝐷 ∗ 𝑊𝑡

(7)

Were:
Transport Distance (𝐷) [km]
Total Waste Weight (𝑊𝑡 ) [kg]
To get a more accurate result the value from formula 7 needs to be multiplied with the
business waste weight percentage and then normalized to the functional unit by
dividing it with products created per bin emptying (Formula 8).
Waste Transport Emissions per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒘 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] is achieved when
considering the business garbage weight as formula 8.

𝑷𝑬𝒘 =

(

𝑏𝑖𝑛

𝑊𝑡

∗𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 )+𝐸𝑖𝑛

𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑛

(8)

Were:
Garbage Bin Size (bin) [kg]
Products per Bin Emptying (𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑛 ) [products]
Waste can be divided into all three categories depending heavily on waste management
in the country where the calculations are performed. Both landfills and recycled
products can be considered new products and be left out from further reporting.
Leaving only combustion as an emission factor (Formula 9).
Combustion Emission per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒄𝒐𝒎 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] needs to consider the
percentage that is brought to waste incineration facilities (Formula 9).
𝑷𝑬𝒄𝒐𝒎 =

𝑐𝑜𝑚 𝑥 𝑏𝑖𝑛 𝑥 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚

Were:

14

3.4.4 Transport Emissions
Transport vehicle emissions can contain either both distance and weight (Formula 10)
or only distance (Formula 11). If only distance is used no weight parameters are
needed, which means that inbound will just add to distance travelled.
Transport Emissions can be either for material to make the product or for transporting
the product itself.
Transport Vehicle Emission Outbound (𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) [kg𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] with full weight load and
distance (Formula 10).
𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 ∗ 𝐷 ∗ 𝑊𝑡

(10)

Were:
Transport Vehicle Emissions (𝐸𝑡 ) [kg𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/km * kg]
Transport Weight (𝑊𝑡 ) [kg]
Transport Vehicle Emissions Inbound (𝐸𝑖𝑛 ) [kg𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] contains a partial weight load
as shown in formula 11.
𝐸𝑖𝑛 = 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∗ 𝑊𝑡 ∗ 𝐷𝑖𝑛 ∗ 𝐸𝑡

(11)

Were:
Distance Inbound (𝐷𝑖𝑛 ) [km]
Both equation 12a and 12b present an acceptable emission value for transportation,
but 12a should always be used, if possible, as it is more accurate and reliable. Both
equations cover the normalization to the functional unit by dividing with products in
its cargo hold.
Transport Emission per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒕 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] using both weight and
distance has the highest accuracy for transport emissions as shown in 12a.
𝑷𝑬𝒕 =

(𝐸𝑜𝑢𝑡 +𝐸𝑖𝑛 )

Were:

still acceptable, result as shown in formula 12b.

(12b)

3.4.5 Retail Emissions
Retail, similar as transportation, can be either for the product itself or the material to
create the product. If it stores material, the unit needs to be transformed into emission
per product stored (Formula 13).
Product Stored (𝑆) [product] is needed for the Emission per Material/Product Stored
(𝑷𝑬𝒔 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] conversion later.

(13)

Were:
Material per Product (M) [material/product]
Material Stored (𝑆𝑚 ) [material]
Using a given value for electricity used per area of floor space and the area used for
the product it shows the number of emissions produced per hour per area. Multiplying
this with storage time (Formula 14) gives the total storage emissions in functional units
as the product was already included from formula 13.
Emission per Material/Product Stored (𝑷𝑬𝒔 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] gives retail
emissions from area and Product Stored (𝑆) [product] (Formula 14).
𝑷𝑬𝒔 = 𝑡𝑠 ∗ 𝐴 ∗ 𝐸𝑙𝑓𝑠 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙 ∗ 𝑆

Were:

3.4.6 Material, Material Processing Emission & Non-consumables
An emission table that returns emission per € spent covers both processing and raw
material acquisition and simplifies calculations for the user and can, therefore, ignore
the following three formulas.
Formula 15 is for raw material processing. If the product the user produces is from raw
material, this part will give zero emissions.
Material Emission per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒎 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] gives material or product
emissions using proxy data (Formula 15).

Formula 16 covers the acquisition of the raw material and packaging while formula 17

Calculated in a similar fashion are the non-consumable emissions. Products, for

17
example vehicles, machinery, and furniture, also have emissions but they need to be
spread out over their full lifetime (formula 18).

Some products use energy and are, therefore, required in the emission calculations
(Formula 19).
Product Emissions During Lifetime (𝑷𝑬𝒍 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] is only needed if the
product requires heating, fuel or uses energy in other ways.
𝑷𝑬𝒍 = 𝑡𝑙 ∗ 𝑡𝑢 ∗ 𝐸𝑙𝑝 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙

(19)

Were:
Product Lifetime (𝑡𝑙 ) [days]
Average Product Usage per Day (𝑡𝑢 ) [h]
Product Energy Usage (𝐸𝑙𝑝 ) [days]
Several additional things can be included in the consumer emissions, for example, fuel
usage and exhaust emissions if it is a vehicle or cold storage if frozen products. The
only ones covered here are for electrical appliances and heating of food products, as
further inclusion would make this part long and complex.

3.4.8 Total Product Emissions
Adding together all emission per product results in total product emission. Some of

18
these product emissions might have more than one value that needs to be added
together (Formula 20).
Total Emissions per Product (𝑷𝑬𝒕𝒐𝒕 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡] is all earlier calculated
emissions summarized with the functional unit (Formula 20).
𝑷𝑬𝒕𝒐𝒕 = 𝑃𝐸𝑙 + 𝑃𝐸𝑟𝑚 + 𝑃𝐸𝑚 + 𝑃𝐸𝑠 + 𝑃𝐸𝑡 + 𝑃𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 + 𝑃𝐸𝑤 + 𝑃𝐸𝑣 + 𝑃𝐸𝑝

SERVICE CALCULATIONS

Both service calculations were made without fully established formulas. Some
formulas were the same and could simply be re-used, while some new ones needed to
be made as well.
For service calculations, a focus on smaller emissions are needed since in most cases
one process does not contain a large part of the total emissions.

3.5.1 Hotel
The emissions were calculated over one night’s stay at the hotel. Included in these
calculations were cleaning, energy usage for different devices, common areas energy
usage, waste emissions and product emissions.
The absolute largest emission was shown to be air conditioning, both for cooling and
heating. The reason for this could be wrongly calculated idle times or an inefficient
cooling/heating system.

3.5.2 Storage
Storage or retail emissions followed the same simplified rules as hotel calculations,
meaning that each device, consumable and non-consumable product, vehicle, and
waste has their own emissions.
The diverging part is the unit used. For the report and calculations to make sense it
needs to show how a stored element translates into emissions. This is most easily done
by calculating storage space and dividing total emissions by the area. This forms the

19
unit 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑚2 that is easy to understand.
The value can then be multiplied by the number of days stored, as well as the amount
of area that the product takes up to acquire total emission from a single stored product.
3.6

FORMULAS FOR SERVICES

The formulas are generalized as far as they can be and can therefore be repeated several
times, if needed, for each service emission calculation.
The functional unit is one decided by the business making the calculations, and one
that makes sense in the context. For example, 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / night stay, 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / 𝑚2 , Or
𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 / load weight.

3.6.1 Device Energy Usage
Devices include any device that uses energy to run. Most of these are lightbulbs and
computers. Formula 21 also includes a term for number of devices which is useful
when calculating lightbulb emissions. This term can be removed if emission
calculations for only one device is made.
Service Device Emissions (𝑺𝑬𝒅 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is for a single device or a collection of
similar devices used during the same period of time (Formula 21).
𝑺𝑬𝒅 = 𝐸𝑙𝑑 ∗ 𝑈 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙 ∗ 𝑛

(21)

Were:
Device Energy Usage (𝐸𝑙𝐷 ) [kW]
Usage Time (𝑈) [h]
Emission Coefficient for electricity (𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑙 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑘𝑊ℎ]
Number of Devices (𝑛) [amount]
In some rare cases, the total energy usage for the company can be used. This is doable
for companies that only produce a single service and the service is not split into
different compartments, for example, a hotel service.

20

3.6.2 Water Usage
This is a large part for cleaning services, but all companies use water to some degree.
Formula 22 can be used for individual water usage, for example floor cleaning or for
the total water used, but that is again a rare circumstance.
Service Water Emission (𝑺𝑬𝑯𝟐𝑶 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is acquired from formula 22.
𝑺𝑬𝑯𝟐𝑶 = 𝑤 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑤

(22)

Were:
Water Usage (𝑤) [Litres]
Emission Coefficient for Water (𝑒𝑓𝑤 ) [𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑒]
Formulas 23 and 24 calculate the same thing but with different approaches. Formula
23 uses weight of what will be cleaned to calculate amount of water used, while
formula 24 calculates water used based on how many loads are cleaned.
Service Machine Cleaning Emission (𝑺𝑬𝒎𝒄 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] can be acquired in two
different formulas, depending on the task or machine, formula 23 or 24.
𝑺𝑬𝒎𝒄 = 𝐿 ∗ 𝑤𝑘𝑔 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑤

(23)

Or:
𝑺𝑬𝒎𝒄 = 𝑤𝑙 ∗ 𝑛𝑙 ∗ 𝑒𝑓𝑤

(24)

Were:
Load Size (𝐿) [kg]
Water Usage per kg (𝑤𝑘𝑔 ) [𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑟𝑒/𝑘𝑔]
Water Usage per Load (𝑤𝑙 ) [Litres]
Number of Loads (𝑛𝑙 ) [amount]

3.6.3 Product Emissions
Products consist of all consumable and non-consumable objects that are used in the
service.
Formula 25 is limited to consumable products. Emissions for non-consumable
products needs to be divided by its lifetime (Formula 26).

21

Service Product Emissions (𝑺𝑬𝒑) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is for both consumable and nonconsumable products. Formula 25 covers consumable products.
𝑺𝑬𝒑 = 𝐶 ∗ 𝑒𝑓€

(25)

Were:
Product Cost (𝐶) [€]
Emissions Coefficient per € spent (𝑒𝑓€ ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/€]

Product Lifetime (𝑡𝑝 ) [days] is required when calculating emissions of nonconsumable products as shown in formula 26.
𝑺𝑬𝒑 =

𝐶∗𝑒𝑓€
𝑡𝑝

(26)

3.6.4 Waste Emissions
Service waste emissions use the same formulas as product life cycle waste emissions,
formulas 6-9. Designating 𝑺𝑬𝒘 for collected service waste emissions.

3.6.5 Transportation Emissions
Service transport emissions use the same formulas as product life cycle transport
emissions, formulas 10-12b. Designating 𝑺𝑬𝒕 for collected service transport
emissions.

3.6.6 Work machines
Work machines transport emissions use the same formulas as product life cycle
transport emissions, formulas 4 and 5. Designating 𝑺𝑬𝒗 for collected service work
machine emissions.

3.6.7 Refrigeration
Refrigeration is a point included in the wizard that informs the users that if their
refrigerator needs to have its coolant refilled, they need to switch or repair it, as it has
potential of large GHG emissions. Refrigeration units are made not to leak, which
would otherwise lead to emission formulas being obsolete.

22

3.6.8 Total Service Emissions
Adding together all emissions per product results in total service emission. Several of
these have multiple service emission values for different parts that need to be added
together.
Formula 27 covers most service industry’s needs, except retail. Retail or storage
services need to know how much emission each 𝑚2 of storage space has.
Total Service Emissions (𝑺𝑬𝒕𝒐𝒕 ) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒] is the collected service emissions with the
functional unit (Formula 27).
𝑺𝑬𝒕𝒐𝒕 = 𝑆𝐸𝑣 + 𝑆𝐸𝑡 + 𝑆𝐸𝑤 + 𝑆𝐸𝑝 + 𝑆𝐸𝑚𝑐 + 𝑆𝐸𝐻2𝑂 + 𝑆𝐸𝑑

(27)

Service Emissions per Area (𝑺𝑬𝑨) [𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒/𝑚2 ] is used if the service is to store
products or material and is acquired from formula 28.
𝑺𝑬𝑨 =

𝑆𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡

RESULTS

The four cases calculated were ceramic cup production, scones production, one night’s
hotel stay service and storage service. From these four, scones production and one
night’s hotel stay service were compressed into easily viewable data for easier result
presentation.
The scone’s data includes a deviating emission, color coded in table 2, from baking
powder transportation since it uses the less accurate formula (Formula 12b). It also
shows that a large part of product life cycle emissions originates from waste
combustion as well as refrigeration and heating at consumer end. Transportation
emissions using formula 12a shows that the amount of load-% that the user has results
in higher emissions than distance.

In the calculations for scones (see Appendix II), three different transportation
calculations were tested of which the third one gave the most accurate result. The three
methods were:
1. Only distance and vehicle emissions
2. Distance, total weight, and the producer’s part of that weight.
3. An addition of inbound and outbound journey to method 2.

Figure 2 Transportation methods 1,2 and 3, and their total impact on emissions

The calculations are compressed to the most important data by using a similar structure
to table 2 and table 3. These results show the scone’s data and one night at a hotel data
respectively. These two shows how the formulas work, proxy data, as well as the
difference between product life cycle and service life cycle.
Most of a one night’s stay at a hotel’s emission originates from the air conditioner. It
reinforces that waste incineration is a high emission process. Commodities and public
areas have a noticeable emission percentage. Cleaning up after the guest is within
report included barriers, larger than 1%, and showing that cleaning and water usage

influences emission result.

DISCUSSION

Trough four life cycle cases this study established formulas to simplify the creation
of more life cycle cases. These formulas should be easy to apply as logic in the
development of applications, or as tools to calculate life cycle emissions. It is worth
noting that the formulas can be changed or reworked to better function or fit the tool
it will be used for.
The LCA proxy data table multiplies the monetary value spent by a given emission
value in 𝑘𝑔𝐶𝑂2 𝑒 to acquire and estimate. It is a very simplified method that can
heavily fluctuate if a cheap supplier is found. Even so, it is still an acceptable fault at
this point in development, as the need is for a simple and fast way to estimate
emission values for everyday products without every company that provides material
or products having to do their own GHG emission calculations. In the future, most
companies might have done them, and can thereafter update the database with more
accurate values for products or services.
Another potential large part missing from these calculations is LCU. Deforested
areas cannot capture 𝐶𝑂2 and are, therefore, a climate impact for example a quarry
where clay is dug. The reason for this was that the impact was tiny enough to be
discarded and no easy way of calculating LCU exists.
It is also worth noting that some special cases can exist that cannot do a complete
GHG report with the given formulas. These cases have not arisen, as no testing has
been done.
The three transportation calculation methods formed were:
1. Only distance and vehicle emissions
2. Distance, total weight, and the producer’s part of that weight.
3. An addition of inbound and outbound journey to method 2.
From these methods, 2 and 3 where close to each other but did give a lower more
accurate value with method 3. Method 1 results in this calculation making up most of
the product emissions on its own, making it almost invalid as a method of
calculation.

27
The water emission base stat is an old source and the emission per liter calculation
was done by someone else and could therefore be updated to hopefully show less
emission on water usage in the Hotel calculations.
In the same hotel data, the air conditioner has the largest emissions by far. This can
either be caused by an inefficient ac unit or overestimation on usage time. Changing
temperature uses large amounts of energy making its energy usage believable.
Comparing these calculations to others is not a fair comparison, as most other LCA
calculations are closer to an entire study long and made more in detail (DANTES
project, 2006).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The main goal of this thesis was to see if formulas and other tools could help create an
emission calculation tool. This goal is achieved, and the tool can be made using the
following formulas and result. Table 2 and 3 can already be shown to customers how
much emissions your product or service emits as well as a starting point to develop a
valid GHG report.
Two placeholder wizards were made parallel with this thesis work to help development
as well as included assurance statement and links to where information was gathered
for the project. These were not mentioned, as they include development notes that
should not be public and are outside the scope of this thesis. The wizards are also made
to help two IT students with their final thesis, as their part is the programing and pilot
testing.
In the coming months, further development will be done using this theory as a base.
The full value of this study is not shown before pilot testing has been concluded. The
company is committed to reworking formulas, if needed, as this was done entirely
theoretically.
Looking only at the amount of work between the ceramic cup calculations and the
scones calculations, 36 hours and 4 hours respectively, the method is already
simplified. Several hours can be disregarded as learning experience but the difference
is still striking.
Service calculations showed a similar time reduction; even without any set formulas,
both calculations took no longer than four hours to complete. This shows that the
methods used for the product life cycle calculations work, even if they are not directly
applied to the system as well as experience plays a large part in doing these
calculations.
Transportation emission calculation method 1 should be allowed to be used but refer
away from this method as it gives the most inaccurate result of all three methods.

29
The LCA database that was composed makes it possible to make these calculations
fast and without needing access to every supplier’s emission data.
The data made is enough to start development and pilot test and has, therefore,
achieved the set goal for this study.
A large part of this work would have been simplified if access to a good LCA database
had been available. Greenhouse Gas Protocol has several on its website with other
calculation tools, each one with its own limitation. The limiting factors for this project
were accessibility and copyright, as the database needed to be free for commercial use
and a budget was not given for the project.
A factor that was mentioned in this report was LCA databases and the lack of free ones
that fulfill the needs of this thesis. A study on LCA databases that works well in the
Nordic countries could be done as, currently, the only ones that are available and fulfill
the needs are set in the US or UK and are up to five years old. An option that could
work is the Ecoinvent database. It was not used in this study for capital and copyright
reasons.
Another study that could be conducted is focused on LCU. Similar formulas to those
done in this report would simplify the way to calculate LCU emissions.

SVENSK SAMMANFATTNING
GHG-rapportering av tjänster och produkter
Målet med studien är att ge en grund för att utveckla en applikation för beräkning av
utsläpp. Studien begränsas till att omfatta små och medelstora företag som inte har råd
att hyra konsulter eller tid att göra beräkningarna själva. För att uppnå detta behövs en
standard som kan följas i utsläppsberäkningarna. För detta ändamål valdes GHGriktlinjer som beskrivs i Greenhouse Gas Protocol, publicerat av World Resource
Institute 2011. Arbetet fokuserar inte på hela företagets utsläpp utan på dess produkter
och tjänster. Orsaken till detta är att företagen ska kunna visa sina kunder hur mycket
utsläpp dessa produkter och tjänster har, samtidigt som det blir allt mer efterfrågat.
Studien i sig själv är helt teoretisk och kommer att utvecklas efter studiens gång.
De två huvudsakliga referenserna för att skapa formlerna som behövs är GHG
Protocol, Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard (Greenhouse Gas
Protocol, 2011) och Guide to PAS 2050 (Carbon Trust, Defra, BSI, 2008). Den första
referensen handlar enbart om produktlivscykeln och den andra har bra exempel för
serviceindustrin.
En produktlivscykel består av moduler som kallas Cradle-to-Gate, Gate-to-Gate och
Gate-to-Grave. Dessa tre motsvarar hela produktens livscykel från råmaterial till
återvinning eller avfallsförbränning. Cradle-to-Gate är modulen innan råmaterialet
kommer till fabriken, Gate-to-Gate består av alla utsläpp som tillverkningen av
produkten medför i producentens fabrik och Gate-to-Grave är tredje partens förvaring,
slutanvändning och avfallshantering. Gate-to-Grave kan ignoreras ifall företaget
producerar produkter som går till andra företag och vidareutvecklas. En modul är ett
beskrivande ord för en del av produktens livscykel, alltså en samling med utsläpp vid
ett visst stadium av produktens liv.
Ett generellt livscykeldiagram skapades för att vägleda användaren. Detta diagram
hjälper användaren att se vilka processer som finns och med att skapa ett eget diagram

31
för företaget. Formlerna som skapades motsvarar specifikt produktionens egna
utsläpp, arbetsmaskiner använda inom produktionen, avfallshanteringsutsläpp,
transportutsläpp, tredje partens förvaringsutsläpp, råmaterial och andra produkters
utsläpp och slutanvändarens utsläpp.
Utsläpp från tjänster saknar en liknande uppställning i moduler som en
produktlivscykel och därför är det svårare att uppdela utsläppen när allt måste läggas
i större eller ännu mindre kategorier. Sättet som det gjorts i detta arbete är att dela upp
alla olika utsläpp och sedan gruppera dem i följande kategorier: elförbrukande enheter,
vattenanvändning, material och produkter, avfall, transport och fordon. Avfall,
transport, material och produkter kan alla uppskattas med liknande formler från en
produktlivscykel.
För att skapa dessa formler behövdes beräkningar att hänvisa till. Först gjordes en
beräkning för ett litet företag som tillverkade keramiska kaffekoppar (Se bilaga I).
Tidsmässigt tog denna beräkning längst eftersom det var den första livscykelanalysen
(LCA) och kunskapen att göra dessa beräkningar saknades.
Den andra en produktlivscykelberäkning som gjordes var för ett större bageri som
tillverkade scones (Se bilaga II). I denna beräkning testades formlerna som skapades i
den första beräkningen. Det visade sig underlätta arbetet och beräkningen kunde
snabbt sammanfattas. Under beräkningens gång testades också tre olika varianter av
transportutsläppsberäkningar. En metod använde endast distans, en annan distans och
vikt och den tredje beräknade också hur tomt transportfordonet var då produkter
hämtades. Av dessa tre ger den tredje metoden bäst resultat medan den första ger ett
starkt avvikande resultat från de andra två metoderna, men kan fortfarande godkännas
som en uppskattning.
Två beräkningar gjordes även för utsläppberäkningar för tjänster och dessa gjordes
innan formlerna var fullt bearbetade. Orsaken till detta var att se hur olika tjänster
avvek från varandra.

32
Den första tjänsteutsläppberäkningen baserades på en natt spenderad på hotell (Se
bilaga III). Några formler kunde tas direkt från produktlivscykelsformlerna och då
återstod beräkningar för städning, incheckning och belysning samt allmänna områden
som gym och bar. Dessa delades upp i elanvändande enheter och vattenkonsumerande
processer som sedan kunde tillämpas på andra tjänster.
Den sista beräkningen som gjordes baseras på ett lagerutrymme (Se bilaga IV). Tillägg
utöver hotellberäkningarna var fordonsberäkningar för att flytta tunga lagrade
produkter. Både el- och bränsledrivna fordon behövdes beaktas. Med dessa
beräkningar kunde tjänsteutsläppsformlerna skapas.
De formler som visas i denna studie, beskrivande text och en egen skräddarsydd LCAdatabas för att uppskatta utsläppen av råmaterial och produkter baserat på euro
spenderad (se Ingversen & Li 2020) gör att beräkningarna kan färdigställas på en dag,
vilket i sig själv visar att formlerna och en liten mängd kunskap är tillräckligt för att
applikationen ska kunna användas.

inte av föreliggande studie.
Studien fungerar som en bas men resultaten kommer säkerligen att genomgå
förändringar i framtiden. Detta är redan beräknat men utvecklingen kan ta år och
detaljer kan inte omfattas av denna studie.
Flera forskningsområden saknade uppdaterade studier eller ett standardiserat sätt att
tillämpa beräkningar. En studie på LCA-databaser kunde göras samt studier inom hur
utvinningen av råmaterial för produkter förändrar landskap och miljöer (LCU, Land
Use Change).
LCU beräknar effekten av markförändringar på klimatet. Om skog huggs ner kan den
inte fånga 𝐶𝑂2 och det påverkar i sin tur utsläppen. Inga enkla sätt att tillämpa LCU

33
på utsläppsberäkningar finns, men de beräkningar som fanns visade att de flesta LCUutsläppen är under 1 % och kan därför uteslutas.
Kollagring är fortfarande ett så nytt forskningsområde att det ännu inte finns på en
utbredd marknad. Idén med kollagring är att lagra kol i till exempel tegelstenar till hus
istället för att släppa ut det i atmosfären. Nya sätt att producera olika produkter är på
snabbt intåg när t.o.m. tävlingar (XPRIZE Foundation, 2021) för att ta fram produkter
som kan lagra kol hålls.
