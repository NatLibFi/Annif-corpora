Title: The effect of business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure
and profitability: An empirical analysis of Finnish listed firms
Supervisor: Thomas Carrington
Abstract:
This thesis examines the effect of business failure risk on the relationship between
capital structure and profitability. It exploits the principal-agent theory and assumes
the firm’s risk of business failure to lead to different business environments, based on
which, it is hypothesized that the effect of a firm’s debt ratio on its profitability depends
on its level of business failure risk. By utilizing multiple regression analyses,
accounting data of Finnish listed firms during the years 2015-2019 are analyzed.
The results indicate the effect of business failure risk on the relationship between
capital structure and profitability to be observable but statistically insignificant. In
firms with low risk of business failure, a higher debt ratio seems to negatively affect
profitability, while in firms with high risk of business failure, the effect is observed to
be opposite. In addition, the results of this thesis support the assumption that the firm’s
risk of business failure affects its business environment.
This thesis offers both similar as well as differing results compared to previous
research. However, as the results of this thesis are statistically insignificant, the
previously achieved results cannot be confirmed and the contribution to existing
research is limited. In conclusion, rather than offering definitive answers regarding the
effect of business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure and
profitability, this thesis offers multiple opportunities for future research to increase the
knowledge about the research topic in question.

1 INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the research topic will be presented. First, background information of the
topic will be provided, which is be followed by a problem discussion that will further
clarify the research problem. Second, the purpose of the study as well as the limitations
of study are be presented. Finally, the structure of the thesis will be presented.

1.1 Background
Profitability is one of the main elements when determining a firm’s success in the
business world and its role has only increased in today’s internationalized and extremely
competitive business environment. Due to the fact that new firms with new business ideas
are being founded continuously, whereas the older actors are trying to keep their footholds
in the markets, the importance of a firm’s ability to generate profits has increased. This
has led to a situation where profitability has become one of the most important factors for
firms and, consequently, the interest towards the factors affecting profitability has
increased as well.
However, the topic is already known to previous research since a great number of studies
have examined factors affecting a firm’s profitability. For example, factors such as a
firm’s size (Gschwandtner, 2005) and age (Claver, Molina & Tari, 2002) as well as
macroeconomic conditions (Egbunike & Okerekeoti, 2018) have been found to affect a
firm’s profitability. On the contrary, previous research has also found factors that suffer
from a lack of consensus regarding their effect on profitability. Capital structure, usually
defined as the combination of financing sources used by firms to finance investments, has
been a highly examined area of research during the last few decades and, especially, the
debate about its influences on firms’ success has been ongoing. Whereas a set of studies
have suggested a firm’s capital structure to affect its success and profitability as well (e.g.,
Jensen, 1986; Cassar & Holmes, 2003), a great number of studies has found the opposite
results (e.g., Soumadi & Hayajneh, 2012; Abor, 2005).
Since the results of previous research regarding the relationship between capital structure
and firm success remain mixed, it has been examined by focusing on additional factors.
For example, a firm’s age and size (Lappalainen & Niskanen, 2012), innovativeness (Lööf
1

& Heshmati, 2006) and asset turnover (Pervan & Višić, 2012) have been observed to
affect the relationship. Moreover, a firm’s risk of business failure has been suggested to
be an influential factor of that type as well. Li, Niskanen and Niskanen (2019) found that
the relationship between capital structure and financial performance was moderated by a
firm’s credit risk in small and medium-sized companies. More specifically, they found
that in low-risk firms, a more debt-weighted capital structure was negatively related to
firms’ financial performance and, conversely, in high-risk firms, the effect was opposite.

1.2 Problem discussion
Although the relationship between capital structure and profitability has been examined
to a considerable extent, Li et al. (2019) were the first ones to study the effect of the firm
related risk on the relationship. Their study offered an interesting opening to the
discussion, but, at the same time, certain questions still remain unanswered. Firstly, Li et
al. (2019) considered the relationship between capital structure and financial
performance. As financial performance is seen as a more broadened view of firm success
compared to profitability, the focus on profitability may offer further insights of the
relationship and, simultaneously, offer knowledge about tools that help firms to survive
in today’s highly competitive business environment. Secondly, Li et al. (2019) focused
on the risk of business failure from a credit risk perspective, meaning that the risk measure
used in the study concentrates to the solvency of a firm. As solvency represents only a
part of business failure risk, a broadened measure may offer alternative results. Thirdly,
Li et al. (2019) focused on small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) omitting large
companies that, in general, have a totally different business environment. Consequently,
the focus on larger companies may offer further insights of the research topic.
Today markets are highly competitive around the globe and the importance of
profitability for a firm is indisputable. Without an ability to generate profit, a firm will
struggle to survive and, in the worst case, go bankrupt. In fact, as the competition in the
markets has increased, firms face difficulties to meet the required level of profitably,
which increases the importance of studying factors that affect a firm’s profitability in
today’s business environment (Yazdanfar, 2013). However, previous research regarding
the relationship between capital structure and firm success has mainly focused on
examining the relationship between capital structure and financial performance (e.g.,
2

Jensen, 1986; Soumadi & Hayajneh, 2012). Consequently, profitability as a separate
concept has received less attention, even though its importance for firm success has been
proven by prior research (e.g., Yafdanfar, 2013).
Likewise, prior research has so far only examined the effect of business failure risk on
the relationship in question from credit risk perspective. However, business failure risk
can be viewed from several perspectives and, consequently, also the variety of methods
to measure it is extensive, broadening the possibilities to examine the effects of business
failure risk as well. Traditionally, accounting-based measures have dominated the field,
perhaps as a consequence of their long history, but certain methods have perceived to suit
better in measuring particular risk related to business failure. As accounting data have
been observed to reflect several aspects of the business failure risk, previous research has
suggested the measures based on accounting data to be good predictors of overall business
failure risk (Beaver, Kettler & Scholes, 1970; Farrelly, Ferris & Reichenstein, 1985;
Beaver, McNichols & Rhie, 2005). More recently, measures based on accounting data
have been started to complement with qualitative data in order to improve the prediction
accuracy of the measures. For example, good results have been achieved with data from
audit reports (Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009; Muñoz‐Izquierdo, Laitinen, Camacho‐Miñano
and Pascual‐Ezama, 2020).
Noticeably, accounting-based measures rely strongly on accounting data, which means
that the amount and quality of accounting data have an important role in measuring
business failure risk and, consequently, can affect the results of the study. Whereas Li et
al. (2019) concentrated on SMEs, the data of listed firms ensure the amount and quality
of the accounting data, since regulation (Wulandari & Rahman, 2004) and markets (Ball
& Shivakumar, 2005) set a demand for more extensive accounting reports for listed firms.
Moreover, as mentioned before, the data of listed firms enables to examine the effect of
business failure risk in totally different business environment. The different business
environment of listed firms is mainly explained with the economies of scale (Pervan &
Višić, 2012, 214) but also with their better access to financing. Whereas SMEs face
limited financing possibilities based on, for example, the lack of financing alternatives
(Jõeveer, 2013), the situation is different for listed firms that have more financing
alternatives available via public capital markets and better access to debt financing relying
on reduced information asymmetry (Vermoesen, Deloof & Laveren, 2012, 436). Thereby,
long-term debt should solely be a financing alternative among others for listed firms.
3

However, the situation is not as unambiguous as usually assumed. For example, large
firms are found to have a potential to employ more debt (Ojah & Manrique, 2005) and
rely more on debt financing compared to smaller firms (Daskalakis & Psillaki, 2007).
Furthermore, for example, a country’s legal environment is found to affect capital
structure decisions in firms (Bancel & Mittoo, 2004). Additionally, development of bond
and stock markets is found to be an influential factor to capital structure, suggesting that
a more developed bond market pursue debt financing, whereas a developed stock market
has the opposite effect (Jong, Kabir & Nguyen, 2008). In this context, Finland offers an
interesting environment to examine business failure risk as a moderating factor in
relationship between capital structure and profitability in listed firms. Previously the
Finnish capital market has been highly restricted (Nyberg & Vaihekoski, 2013), and
although a strong financial deregulation has occured, the Finnish capital markets are still
bank-centralized (Niskanen & Niskanen, 2006), which means that the importance of debt
financing is unquestionable among Finnish listed firms.

1.3 Purpose of the study
This study aims to contribute to the prior research in two ways. Firstly, by examining the
effect of business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure and
profitability, the knowledge of the relationship between capital structure and firm success
can be broadened. Secondly, by using data of Finnish listed firms, the effect of firm
related risk on the relationship can be examined in a different environment, in which,
additionally, surprisingly little research of capital structure, profitability, and business
failure risk have been conducted. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to examine if the
relationship between capital structure and profitability is driven by the risk of business
failure among Finnish listed firms.

1.4 Limitations of the study
In order to examine the purpose of the study as properly as possible, certain limitations
are made concerning the research design of the study. Firstly, the sample is limited to
Finnish firms listed at Helsinki Stock Exchange in order to examine the aim of the study

4

with data of publicly listed firms in Finnish business environment. Secondly, only the
effect of business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure and
profitability is examined in this study, meaning that other affecting variables and the
possible side effects are not considered and, consequently, excluded from the study.
Thirdly, the research period is limited to years 2015-2019, mainly as a consequence of
data availability reasons but also in order to capture the effect of business failure risk on
the relationship in the multi-year period.

1.5 Structure of the thesis
Chapter one presented the research topic and background related to it, followed by the
purpose of the study as well as the limitations of the study. Chapter two will present the
relevant theories as well as the definitions of the concepts related to the research topic. In
chapter three, an overview of previous research regarding the research topic will be
provided. The fourth chapter will present the research method and data for this thesis as
well as discuss the reliability and validity of the study. Chapter five will present the
analysis results which is followed by chapter six that will provide a discussion of them.
Chapter seven will offer conclusions of this thesis and, lastly, chapter eight includes a
summary of this thesis in Swedish.

2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
This chapter will present the concepts as well as the basic theories related to the research
subject. Firstly, the definitions and theories about profitability, capital structure, and
business failure will be presented. Secondly, business failure prediction models will be
shortly overviewed, and lastly, the study’s empirical context will be discussed.

2.1 Profitability
Profitability is one of the key factors in a firm’s survival in the business world. Without
an ability to achieve profits, a firm will struggle to survive in today’s highly competitive
business environment. In general, profitability is seen as a capability to generate profits
with a firm’s resources, hence, for example, Dioha, Mohammed, and Okpanachi (2018)
describes it as a measurement of a firm’s ability to utilize its assets to generate income.
Consequently, profitability also reflects a firm's overall financial health and firm growth
(Dioha et al., 2018) as well as its management’s effectiveness (Yafdanfar, 2013).
In general, both internal and external firm characteristics affect the profitability of a firm.
The internal characteristics are management controllable factors that mainly explain the
differences in profitability between firms, whereas the external characteristics are
uncontrollable factors that affect a firm’s decision-making, but which the firm
management has no control over (Dioha et al., 2018). Furthermore, these internal and
external characteristics can be divided into firm‐specific characteristics, industry
variables, and market‐related variables (Yafdanfar, 2013). However, usually profitability
leads to firm success, because profitable firms can access a set of resources that they use
effectively and, thus, reach competitive advantages (Yafdanfar, 2013).
As mentioned above, the profitability of a firm is dependent on the firm’s ability to exploit
its resources (Dioha et al., 2018; Yazdanfar, 2013). Thereby, as in a firm the range of
assets is wide, the variety of methods to achieve profits is also extensive. Even though
the main idea is to generate profits from pure business, profits can also be achieved, for
example, with investments. Different sources for profitability raise the interest to evaluate
it from various perspectives. For example, shareholder’s profitability is traditionally
distinguished from the overall firm profitability (Nissim & Penman, 2003).

6

2.1.1 Difference between profitability and financial performance
Previous research has distinguished financial performance and profitability as separate
concepts. Whereas financial performance is defined as an ability to achieve planned
financial results (Egbunike & Okerekeoti, 2018), profitability is seen as an ability to
generate profits (Dioha et al., 2018). Even though the definitions of the concepts differ,
they are connected to each other. For example, Egbunike and Okerekeoti (2018) divided
financial performance into three dimensions: productivity, profitability, and market
premium, which means that a firm’s profitability affects its success possibilities. In
conclusion, profitability is seen as an important part of firm performance.
As the definitions of financial performance and profitability differ, so do the measures of
concepts. While financial performance is measured usually with overall performance
measures, for example, pre-tax profit (e.g., Li et al., 2017), profitability is measured with
more specific profit measures, for example, profit margin, return on investments or return
on equity (Fairfield & Yohn, 2012; Rajan, Reichelstein & Soliman, 2007; Trujillo-Ponce,
2012). However, the measurement of concepts overlaps to some extent, which, on the
contrary, provides the connection between them (Otley, 2007, 28-29). For example,
Egbunike and Okerekeoti (2018) argue for the use of profit measures, such as return on
equity, return on assets, and return on capital, as the measures for financial performance.

2.1.2 Measures for profitability
In general, profitability ratios measure a firm’s ability to use its assets to generate the
necessary rate of return (Egbunike & Okerekeoti, 2018). However, a firm can achieve
profits by exploiting a set of assets, which are financed either with the firm’s earnings or
with the stakeholders’ assistance. Consequently, profitability can also be evaluated from
either perspective, which has pursued a need of various measures, as internal and external
parties are, in essence, interested in their own investments. Therefore, several measures
for profitability have been introduced in theory.
Previous research has utilized the extensive set of profitability measures to a considerable
extent. For example, such measures as operating income (Bennett & Donnelly, 1993),
profit margin (Fairfield & Yohn, 2012), return on investments (Rajan, Reichelstein &
Soliman, 2007), return on assets (Lipunga, 2014) and return on equity (Trujillo-Ponce,
7

2012) have been used as proxies for profitability, either separately or together.
Additionally, certain measures represent a specific perspective of profitability, which has
also been examined by previous research. For example, return on equity is widely used
as a proxy for shareholder profitability (Nissim & Penman, 2003), while return on assets
is commonly seen as a proxy for internal profitability (Kadim, Sunardi & Husain, 2020).
Moreover, certain external parties have their own suggestions for appropriate profitability
measures. For example, economists suggest the use of internal rate of return for measuring
profitability in a firm (Chen & Lee, 1995), while such measures as earnings/price and
book-to-market ratios combine accounting and market data (Joos & Lang, 1994) and are
therefore preferred by analysts as their interest lies in the markets’ valuation of a firm.

2.2 Capital structure theories
The term capital structure refers to different alternatives to finance a firm’s business
resources. In general, a firm can be financed with an equity or a debt or a combination of
them. Whereas debt refers to the money loaned mainly from financial institutions, with
equity is meant the money that investors have invested in the firm. Furthermore, in prior
research the relationship between debt and equity is commonly measured by a ratio called
leverage. As different alternatives to finance a firm exist, capital structure theories seek
to provide the most appropriate alternatives to finance a firm and, furthermore, provide
the relationship between capital structure and firm’s ability to generate profits, because
profitability is acknowledged as an important part of a firm’s success.
In general, capital structure is based on four basic theories: the Modigliani-Miller
theorem, the principal-agent theory, the pecking-order theory, and the trade-off theory.
The Modigliani-Miller theorem argues the irrelevance of capital structure in relation to a
firm’s ability to generate profits, whereas the principal-agent theory, the pecking-order
theory, and the trade-off theory argue the opposite by highlighting the relationship.
Furthermore, the principal-agent theory and the trade-off theory suggest a positive
relationship, while the pecking-order theory proposes the opposite.

8

2.2.1 The Modigliani-Miller theorem
The Modigliani-Miller theorem refers to Modigliani and Miller’s (1958) pioneering
article about the irrelevance of capital structure in perfect market conditions. Modigliani
and Miller (1958) proposed that a firm’s value is calculated as the present value of its
future earnings as well as underlying assets, and it is independent of the firm’s capital
structure. As mentioned, a firm can be financed either with debt and equity, and both of
these alternatives have costs in practice. However, the Modigliani-Miller theorem is
based on the assumption that financing costs and taxes do not exist, which makes a firm’s
financing source irrelevant, since none of the financing alternatives is less or more
profitable.
However, it is generally known that the perfect market conditions exist only in theory,
which has been proven in several studies examining the effect of capital structure on a
firm’s financial performance and profitability (e.g., Jensen, 1986; Cassar & Holmes,
2003). In fact, Modigliani and Miller (1963) realized this same problem and republished
their capital structure model with corrections of corporate income taxes and the cost of
capital. They suggested that the firm value is affected by taxes and financing costs, since
they found that the cost of equity affects a firm’s leverage level, and the tax-deductible
interest payments make the value of a levered firm higher than the value of an unlevered
firm.

2.2.2 The principal-agent theory
Jensen and Meckling (1976) suggested that a firm’s capital structure is affected by the
costs resulting from the principal-agent problem. With the principal-agent problem they
meant a situation, where two different parties have different priorities and act according
to them, resulting in so-called agency costs. Jensen and Meckling (1976) suggested that
in a firm, two types of principal-agent problems exist: first, between managers and
shareholders, and second, between debt and equity holders. They argued that the optional
capital structure is determined by the agency cost resulting from the separation between
managers and owners. Additionally, Jensen (1986) found that a firm’s choice of debt
financing decreases the available cash flow and, thereby, reduces the agency costs of a
free cash flow.
9

Moreover, Stulz (1990) found that the agency costs prevail, when managers know more
about an investment opportunity than shareholders, which affects a firm’s capital
structure. Furthermore, he argued that debt as a financing alternative affects a firm’s
efficiency by preventing managers from financing unprofitable projects, but he also stated
that it can simultaneously hinder profitable investment opportunities. In addition, the
findings of Hart and Moore (1995) strengthened the idea of the role of debt financing to
a firm’s efficiency, since they found that it reduces the agency costs between managers
and shareholders.

2.2.3 The pecking-order theory
The pecking-order theory states that a firm has an order to its financing choices based on
the cost of a financing alternative. The cost of a financing alternative increases as the risk
of the financing alternative increases and, furthermore, the risk increases as the level of
asymmetric information increases (Myers & Majluf, 1984). With asymmetric information
is referred to situation in which firm managers, also known as insiders, know more about
the situation in firm than other stakeholders, also known as outsiders. Due to the
asymmetric information, the risk of mispricing is higher with external financing
compared to internal financing, since outsiders have less information about the firm
(Myers & Majluf, 1984). Thereby, even the cost of external financing is higher.
Consequently, according to the pecking-order theory, a firm chooses to use internal
financing via retained earnings as the first alternative, debt financing as the second
alternative, and external equity as the third alternative for financing a firm. Since debt
and external equity are seen as riskier and, thus, more expensive alternatives, a firm’s
potential performance and development capability can suffer from using debt or external
equity as a financing alternative. This indicates that a more profitable firm would avoid a
more leveraged capital structure based on its riskier nature. Thereby, the pecking-order
theory suggests that a higher leverage affects firm performance negatively (Çekrezi,
2013).

10

2.2.4 The trade-off theory
Kraus and Litzenberger’s (1973) trade-off theory emphasizes the balance between debt
and equity financing by highlighting the costs and benefits related to debt financing. The
trade-off theory suggests that the debt financing has both, i.e. benefits in form of tax
savings, and costs in form of financial distress, which means that a firm should balance
the trade-off between these two. With debt financing, tax savings can be achieved as the
interest payments are tax-deductible, but financial distress costs are also more likely since
the debt financing increases the possibility of bankruptcy.
Consequently, the trade-off theory seeks an optimum capital structure. The value of a
firm increases, as the level of debt increases, until a certain level of debt, when financial
distress costs exceed the achieved tax savings (Kraus & Litzenberger, 1973). Therefore,
the trade-off theory suggests that the higher leverage a firm has, the more it should gain
tax savings and the better its performance should be (Li et al., 2019, 3). but, on the
contrary, the level of debt cannot exceed the level when financial distress costs exceed
the achieved tax savings. Regardless, this indicates a positive relationship between capital
structure and profitability.

2.3 The risk of business failure
In general, the term business failure refers to a situation when a firm discontinue its
business operations because of its inability to make enough profit (Ahn, Cho & Kim,
2000). Admittedly, several possible sources for a business failure exist, thus the sources
to it can be divided into several risk dimensions. For example, risks can be divided into
financial, operational, and business risk dimensions (Nikkinen & Sahlström, 2005). More
closely, a business failure can happen as a result of more practical reasons, e.g., poor
management skills, insufficient marketing, or a lack of competitiveness (Wu, 2010), but
also as a result of factors that are related to a firm’s business characteristics, e.g., size
(Watson & Everett, 1996) or industry (Watson & Everett, 1999). Furthermore, it can
happen as a result of a domino effect when a business failure of a supplier or customer
leads to the business failure of a firm (Wu, 2010). Undoubtedly, a business failure is
unpleasant for the owners to face, but it has also side effects. For example, development
of economy and society suffers, but also several stakeholders of the firm, such as
11

shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and financial institutions, lose their
benefits (Wu, 2010).
As several parties suffer when a business failure occurs, it can be defined from multiple
perspectives. In theory, business failure is usually defined as bankruptcy, discontinuance
of ownership or a combination of them (Watson and Everett, 1999). In practice, on the
other hand, it is often defined from the information user’s perspective. For example,
lenders define business failure as an insolvency or an inability to repay debt (Wu, 2010),
whereas from auditors’ perspective it is seen as an inability to going concern (Kuruppu,
Laswad & Oyelere, 2003). Consequently, this means that the definition of the business
failure is strongly dependent on the perspective.
Previous research has approached the definition of business failure from different
perspectives. As Laitinen (2009) argues, several definitions exist, and these definitions
describe different stages of business failure. He remarks that, for example, a payment
default is used as a definition of a business failure even though it is more common, and a
milder form of business failure compared to, for instance, bankruptcy. Nevertheless, he
continues that it can still be seen as an early warning sign of upcoming bankruptcy, if the
firm omits its impaired financial condition. Consequently, these early warning signs may
help to estimate a firm’s risk of business failure. Thereby, for example, declined cash
flow and profitability have been used as early warning signs of bankruptcy in business
failure prediction (e.g., Charitou et al., 2004).
However, a business failure is seldom dependent on one or two factors, rather it is a result
of a combination of several ones (Fitzpatrick, 1934, 339). In conclusion, as many risk
categories as possible should be considered when evaluating a firm’s risk of business
failure. As it is time-consuming to measure all risk categories separately, so-called
business failure prediction models offer a useful working tool. Business failure prediction
models have been developed to estimate a firm’s risk of business failure, and these models
have a tendency to measure several risk factors together. The measures offer an easy way
to estimate business failure risk, as business failure can be defined based on the scale that
a measure produce. Since business failure prediction models have been perceived as
useful working tools, a specific model of this type has been exploited in this study as well.
Business failure prediction models are discussed more extensively in the following
section.

2.4 Business failure prediction
The risk of business failure has been examined to a considerable extent and, especially,
the methods to predict business failure have been studied remarkably. After Beaver’s
(1966) pioneering article about the business failure prediction based on accounting ratios,
the development of different prediction methods has been substantial. The early
prediction models were only based on accounting ratios (e.g., Beaver, 1966; Altman,
1968; Ohlson, 1980) but, subsequently, prediction models based on, for example, market
data (e.g., Du, Huang & Jain, 2019) and artificial intelligence (Charitou et al., 2004) have
been developed. Particularly, different prediction methods have been observed to predict
certain risk related to a business failure. For example, market-based measures have been
perceived to outperform in the credit risk prediction (e.g., Hillegeist et al., 2004;
Gharghori et al., 2006), whereas accounting data and, thereby, accounting-based
measures have been observed to predict well the overall risk in a firm (Beaver et al., 1970;
Farrelly et al., 1985). Since the interest of this study is on overall business failure risk, a
measure based on accounting data is utilized, and consequently, the focus of following
chapters is on to the accounting-based measures.

2.4.1 Accounting-based measures
Traditionally, business failure prediction is based on financial information, as suggested
by previous research (e.g., Jones, 1987; Laitinen & Kankaanpää, 1999; Jones & Hensher,
2004). The accounting data has been argued to reflect several aspects of business failure
risk (Beaver et al., 1970; Farrelly et al., 1985; Beaver et al., 2005), which can be seen as
a cause for the dominance of accounting-based measures in the overall business failure
prediction. The first accounting-based risk measure was constructed by Beaver (1966)
and ever since accounting-based measures have been widely used. Their dominance is
mainly explained with the feasibility and easiness of the measures. Since the accounting
data is usually publicly available, at least, for listed firms, accounting-based measures are
easily accessible and, furthermore, relatively effortless to use considering that only the
accounting data is needed, and calculations are based on quite simple formulas.
Furthermore, as only accounting data is needed, the measures are feasible for all types of
companies that produce accounting reports (Altman et al., 2017), making the scale of

13

predictable firms broader compared to, for example, market-based measures that require
stock data to predict the risk of business failure.
However, the accounting-based measures also have drawbacks. In general, the meaning
of measuring business failure risk, is to predict the probability of business failure in
future. Since the accounting data is historical, its ability to reflect information about future
can be questioned. In addition, financial statements follow the going concern-principle,
and the valuation of assets is rarely based on market values limiting the performance of
accounting-based measures. Furthermore, accounting-based measures omit certain data
sources related to business failure prediction. For example, asset volatility that is closely
related to a firm’s ability to repay its debt is an omitted variable in the measures.
(Hillegeist et al., 2004)

2.4.4 Techniques for business failure prediction
Previous research of business failure prediction has been extensive resulting in several
techniques to predict a business failure. The fist technique, developed by Beaver (1966),
was strongly relying on accounting data in form of financial ratios and utilized univariate
analysis. As Balcaen and Ooghe (2006) revised, Beaver used a dichotomous classification
test to select financial ratios that best predict business failure in a firm. However, the
model is referred as an extremely simple and, consequently, it has received considerably
criticism.
Few years after Beaver’s (1966) pioneering model, Altman (1968) presented his
contribution to business failure prediction. So-called Altman Z-score model exploited
statistical multiple analysis technique resulting in a multiple discriminant analysis that
classified an observation into one of several hypothesized groups dependent on the
observation’s characteristics. Based on observations, a linear combination of the
characteristics that were most suitable to discriminate differences between failing and
non-failing firms was formed (Altman, 1968, 592). This technique allowed to produce a
score for a firm based on its risk of business failure. Even though Altman Z-score was
developed over 50 years ago, it has remained as one of the most popular methods to
predict risk of business failure in research and practice (Altman et al., 2016). However,
the multivariate discriminant analysis has also faced criticism regarding to its relatively
14

poor prediction power in the long-term and its requirement of normal distributed data.
The model Altman (1968) developed has been observed to have a good prediction power
one or two years before a business failure but, for example, in five years’ time horizon,
the prediction power drops radically. Also, the multivariate discriminant analysis requires
data to be normally distributed, which financial data is rarely in practice, affecting the
reliability of the model (Barnes, 1982).
Afterwards, conditional probability models have captured foothold in the field of business
failure prediction. This broader category consists of logit analysis, probit analysis and
linear probability modelling all of which seek a combination of variables that successfully
distinguish between failing and non-failing firms (Balcaen & Ooghe, 2006). These
models exploit non-linear maximum likelihood method to estimate firm characteristics
that are likely for failing firms. Overall, all the mentioned methods have been widely used
in business failure prediction since the prediction accuracy of the measures is found
relatively good. As an example, Kamath and He (2006) highlighted that existing
predictions methods achieve collectively an average prediction accuracy of more than
85%. However, as none of the measures have reached 100% prediction accuracy yet, the
development of the measures has continued. Instead of developing totally new measures,
complementing existing measures has been observed as an efficient solution to improve
the prediction accuracy. For example, by combining artificial intelligence techniques and
traditional accounting-based measures a higher prediction accuracy can be reached
(Andrikopoulos & Khorasgani, 2018).
Furthermore, by complementing traditional measures with non-financial data, good
results have been achieved. For example, Back (2005) found that non-financial variables
classified firms better than a model based only on financial ratios. He even found the
combination of financial and non-financial variables to outperform in the business failure
prediction. Since the non-financial variables have been observed to improve the
prediction accuracy, traditional measures have been mixed with several non-financial
variables. For example, by combining financial measures with tax-related information
(Noga & Schnader, 2013) or the legal form, payment behavior, and management structure
of a firm (Laitinen, 1991) an improved prediction accuracy has been reached. More
recently, audit reports have been observed to offer an appropriate complement for
traditional measures. As Hopwood, McKeown, and Mutchler (1989) interpreted,
information in them, such as going concern modifications, include important additional
15

information regarding the first year before a business failure, which helps the
classification of firms to failing and non-failing firms. Thereby, the most recent studies
(e.g., Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009; Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al., 2020) have tested prediction
models that complement accounting-based measures with information in audit reports
and have achieved higher prediction accuracies than the accounting-based measures
alone.

2.4.5 Business failure prediction using auditing data
As mentioned, audit reports include valuable information regarding a firm’s risk of
business failure. According to Mutchler (1984), audit reports should advise investors and
other users about any potential signals of business failure, which means that audit reports
expose important information of a firm’s financial situation. Relying on this, the potential
of audit reports to predict a business failure has been tested. Already Keasey and Watson
(1987) examined the usefulness of audit reports in prediction models by adding variables
specifically related to them in their model. However, the results indicated that the data of
audit opinion and the change of auditor only marginally improved the prediction power.
Afterwards, the usefulness of audit reports in business failure prediction has been tested
more widely. For example, Hopwood et al., (1989) tested audit qualifications in the
prediction models, and more recently, Laitinen and Laitinen (2009) suggested the
information of audit reports to assist in the prediction process. Since audit reports have
been recognized as useful tools, more recent studies have focused on improving the
already existing measures with audit data. One example is Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al. (2020)
who examined the impact of audit data to the prediction power of Altman’s (1968) Zscore model. They found that audit data significantly improved the prediction accuracy
of the Altman Z-score model, as their combined model reached a prediction accuracy of
about 87% while the original model alone reached a prediction accuracy of 77%.

2.4.6 Selection of the measure for business failure
Business failure risk as a whole is dependent on several aspects. Thereby, measures that
can reflect multiple risk dimensions in a firm are seen as most suitable in the business
16

failure prediction. Previous research has argued accounting data to reflect several aspects
of firm related risk (Beaver et al., 1970; Farrelly et al., 1985; Beaver et al., 2005), which
supports the use of accounting-based measures in the business failure prediction. In
practice, one of the most widely used accounting-based measure is Altman Z-score that
has gained popularity, for example, as a help tool in going concern evaluation by auditors,
as suggested by previous research (Altman & McGough, 1974; Koh & Brown, 1991). Its
popularity is mainly explained with its recognizability but also with its relatively good
prediction power (Altman, Iwanicz-Drozdowska, Laitinen and Suvas, 2017). In addition,
it has been observed to perform well in business failure prediction in the Finnish markets
(Laitinen & Laitinen, 1998; Altman et al., 2017).
Even though Altman Z-score has a relatively good business failure prediction power, it
has been improved with several additional factors. For example, by assessing market data
or non-financial data its accuracy has been improved further (Altman, Iwanicz‐
Drozdowska, Laitinen & Suvas, 2015). Recently, studies in the accounting field have used
qualitative accounting variables to improve the accuracy of Altman Z-score. For example,
Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al. (2020) found the information included in audit reports to improve
its accuracy. Especially, they found the number of audit disclosures, a firm's going
concern status, firms’ assets, and firms’ recognition of revenues and expenses to
contribute the prediction accuracy. Based on the above discussion, Altman Z-score
complemented with audit data has been chosen as a measure for business failure risk in
this study.

2.5 Audit reporting
Audit reporting is a part of a firm’s annual accounting process, whose purpose is to verify
the reliability of its financial statements. An audit report itself is a report of a completed
auditing process and it is published simultaneously with a firm’s annual report. According
to O'Reilly, Leitch, and Tuttle (2006), a firm has three main reasons for the audit
reporting: “to signal to outsiders about the prospects of the firm; to provide a potential
source of loss recovery for investors (insurance); and to reduce agency costs”. As a
conclusion, an audit report is an important link between a firm and its external
stakeholders, since it announces important information regarding a firm’s situation from

17

an objective perspective. More closely, an audit report is the principal information source
between auditors and external users (Libby, 1979; Blay, Geiger & North, 2011).
In general, international accounting standards and national accounting laws regulate audit
reporting, which is also the case in Finland. According to the Finnish association of
auditors (2020), audit reports in Finland follow the Finnish accounting law and the
standards set by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. In Finland,
the auditing process covers the auditing of the accounting records, the report of the Board
of Directors, the financial statements as well as the governance report of a company. An
auditor’s duty is to give an assurance about whether the report of the Board of Directors
and the financial statements are free of material misstatements, and to check whether the
members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director have complied with the
rules of the Companies Act. (Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009)
According to the international practice, an auditor’s report can be unqualified, unqualified
with modified wording, or qualified (Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009). In Finland, the
international practice is followed, and the qualifications of audit reports are divided
similarly. Furthermore, an auditor has a possibility to abstain from publishing an audit
statement or leave a remark in the audit report. If an auditor has a doubt that a firm has
an inability to going concern during the upcoming 12 months, the auditor must include a
remark of it in the audit report (Amin, Krishnan & Yang, 2014, 1). Although the remark
is no guarantee of upcoming business failure, it can be seen as an early warning for
outsiders (Geiger & Raghunandan, 2002). In conclusion, an audit report gives outsiders
highly valuable information, as any comment or remark in the audit report may include
relevant signals regarding to the firm’s future (Bauer, 2015). Moreover, as the evaluation
of a firm’s ability to going concern pertains to upcoming 12 months, an audit report
reveals important information regarding the firm’s possibilities in future as well. Thereby,
audit reports are valuable information sources in the business failure prediction, as the
previous research has indicated (Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009; Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al.,
2020).

2.6 The Finnish business environment and regulation
As discussed earlier in section 1.2, Finland offers an interesting environment to perform
the study. Finland is a little country in the border of Europe that has European influences
in its economy, but still holds on to its own special characteristics. In the global scale,
Finland is an extremely small actor that has almost a negligible impact to the world’s
economy. Consequently, the Finnish economy rather follows the movements in the
world’s economy than creates its own. Especially, in today’s highly internationalized and
digitalized world, the economies around the globe seem to be linked to each other, as the
incidents on the other side of the globe have an impact to the home country’s economy
as well. Thereby, the tendency of the Finnish economy to follow movements in the world
economy is quite unexceptional.
However, the situation has not always been the same. Until 1980’s the Finnish economy
was quite closed as a result of the strict legislation that regulated the economy and
markets. For example, the foreign direct investments to and from Finland were unusual.
(Pirinen, 2005, 219) Since then, a strong deregulation has occurred, but still Finland is
seen as a code law country where exists a relative strong legal system (Karjalainen, 2011,
90-91), which even regulates the business environment in Finland. As the focus of this
study is on capital structure, profitability, and business failure risk, the Finnish legal
system regarding to them is discussed in following sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2.

2.6.1 The Finnish capital markets
The Finnish economy has its own special characteristics that affect the business
environment as well as capital markets in Finland. In general, the Finnish economy is
defined as a keiretsu-type economy, which means that institutional owners have an
important role in financing firms (Niskanen & Keloharju, 2000, 460-461). According to
Niskanen and Keloharju (2000, 461), large institutional owners are usually long-term
investors, as they are unwilling to sell their large stakes due to strategic reasons.
Furthermore, Finland is defined as bank-dominated code law country where trade credit,
loans from banks and other financial institutions are the most common source for external
financing (Karjalainen, 2011, 91). Consequently, the ownership structure of Finnish firms
is more concentrated compared to common law countries, which decreases the available
19

financing alternatives. Moreover, as institutional owners and financial institutions have
an important role in financing firms, they also have a notable impact on firms’ decision
making (Kasanen, Kinnunen & Niskanen, 1996, 285-286).
These structural characteristics of the Finnish capital markets can be seen as
consequences of the little size of the market. As Kasanen et al. (1996, 285) emphasize,
the Finnish capital market is thin, meaning that the lack of liquidity and the likelihood of
an adverse price reaction are actual problems in the market. As these side effects rarely
increase the attractiveness of a market, the interest towards the Finnish capital market has
been quite modest. In conclusion, the number of potential investors on the Finnish capital
markets have been confined, which decreases the number of possible financers for Finnish
firms even more.
However, Finland has a strong legal system that even steers the capital markets. Even
though the market is little in Finland, diminishing of certain side effects of the little
market has been possible by regulating firms and, partly, even the markets. For example,
due to strict standards regarding the Finnish firms’ risk disclosures, the quality of firms’
governance is concerned to be top-class in Finland (Miihkinen, 2013, 313). According to
Miihkinen (2013, 313) the highly regulated risk disclosure environment lowers the
information asymmetry in the Finnish market, which, furthermore, reduces the riskiness
of this little market. Furthermore, although Kasanen et al., (1996, 285) argue the Finnish
capital market to be thin, the situation has improved lately. As a strong deregulation has
occurred and the digitalization has taken giant leaps, possibilities for foreign investors to
invest their money in the Finnish market have increased. In addition, Miihkinen (2013,
314) points out that small markets are interesting for foreign investors, as they can provide
diversification benefits, especially if co-movements between them and global markets are
modest.

2.6.2 Accounting regulation in Finland
Two main differences exist between Finnish and international accounting practices
(Niskanen & Keloharju, 2000, 445). Firstly, the accounting law in Finland is liberal
allowing, for example, to form untaxed reserves and to use a free depreciation schedule
for tax purposes. Secondly, reported earnings are closely linked to corporate income
20

taxation, which enables income smoothing, precisely, by exploiting untaxed reserves and
the free depreciation schedule. According to Niskanen and Keloharju (2000, 445), these
practices stem from extremely high corporate tax level that existed in Finland until 1992.
However, even though accounting practices have been harmonized recently, certain
income smoothing possibilities still exist in Finland, especially, for smaller firms.
Along with the accounting practices, laws and standards regulate accounting in Finland.
In general, an accounting obligation exists, meaning that all registered limited companies
are required to compose a financial statement in the end of an accounting period. The
regulation regarding the extent of financial statements is dependent on the size of a firm:
small firms are required to compose only an income statement and a balance sheet,
whereas, for example, public listed firms are required to compose an income statement, a
balance sheet, a cash flow statement, and an annual report (Accounting Act 1336/1997,
3:1). Furthermore, the size of a firm determines that along which standards financial
statements should be composed. Unlisted firms are supposed to follow the Finnish
accounting standards, while public listed firms have to follow international IFRSstandards.
However, as the Finnish accounting practices are defined as strongly tax-related, the
effect of income smoothing possibilities to reported profitability can be discussed. Finnish
firms have had a motivation for managing their earnings downwards, as the income tax
rate has been relatively high (Niskanen and Keloharju, 2000, 444-445). For example,
Kasanen et al. (1996) argued that Finnish listed firms’ profits would have been three times
higher during 1970s and 1980s, if the profits had been calculated with International
Accounting Standards. Consequently, earnings reported in actual financial statements
may be misleading. Nevertheless, income tax rate has been decreased since 1990s and the
harmonization has changed the accounting standards in Finland. For example, as public
listed firms are forced to compose financial statements along with IFRS-standards,
income smoothing in the same extent, as under the Finnish accounting standards, is
impossible. Consequently, as Jarva and Lantto (2013) stated, adoption of IFRS-standards
has increased reported earnings among listed firms in Finland, which can be seen as a
proof of diminished income smoothing.

3 LITERATURE REVIEW
In this chapter, previous research regarding the research topic will be presented. Firstly,
the relationship between capital structure and profitability is discussed, which is followed
by a discussion of the effects of business failure risk on the relationship. Lastly, the
hypothesis of the study will be presented.

3.1 The relationship between capital structure and profitability
Since the capital structure theories have different views about the relationship between
capital structure and profitability, a large number of studies have examined the
relationship empirically. Some of the studies have focused more on testing the capital
structure theories (e.g., Lemmon & Zender, 2010), whereas other studies have examined
the relationship between capital structure, measured as leverage, and profitability in
different conditions. For example, the effect of firm-specific (Jõeveer, 2013), industryspecific (Abor, 2007), and country-specific (Daskalakis & Psillaki, 2008) determinants to
leverage and, thereby, a firm’s ability to generate profits have been examined remarkably.
While these studies have focused on the factors affecting leverage, in other words the
determinants of leverage, a set of studies have examined the consequences of leverage.
For example, the focus has been on the impact of financing on financial performance and
profitability (e.g., Jensen, 1986). However, previous research suggests that the
relationship between capital structure and profitability exist, but the empirical results of
the effect of leverage to profitability are mixed.
Several studies have found a positive relationship between leverage and a firm’s ability
to generate profits (e.g., Jensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990; Cassar & Holmes, 2003). One of the
pioneering studies was Wippern (1966) that examined the relationship in several
industries and found a positive relationship between leverage and financial performance.
Later on, for example, Grossman and Hart (1982) followed by Jensen (1986) suggested
that higher leverage enhances financial performance and profitability. These results are
based on the principal-agent-problem, defined by Jensen and Meckling (1976), meaning
that the higher leverage motivates firm managers to lead the firm in a way, which
generates more cash flow, in order to offset firm’s debt. Consequently, financial
performance and profitability enhances as the cash flow has to be increased.
22

In comparison, some studies have found a negative relationship between leverage and a
firm’s ability to generate profits (e.g., Abor, 2005; Soumadi & Hayajneh, 2012; Jõeveer,
2013). These studies suggested that the more debt a firm has, the higher interest payments
it has to pay, which reduces the firm’s available cash. Furthermore, the reduced amount
of available cash deteriorates investing possibilities and, thus, affects a firm’s ability to
generate profits. Additionally, Abor (2005) highlighted that short-term and long-term
debt can have different effect on profitability, since he found that the short-term debt was
positively related to profitability, whereas the long-term debt was negatively related to
profitability in Ghanaian listed firms.

3.2 The effect of business failure risk to capital structure and
profitability
Previous research indicates that the relationship between capital structure and profitability
is contradictory, as evidence against and for the relationship exist. Since previous research
has been performed in different conditions and the results have been mixed, the effect of
additional factors to the relationship can be discussed. A set of studies have found, for
example, a firm’s age and size (Lappalainen & Niskanen, 2012), innovativeness (Lööf &

Heshmati, 2006) and asset turnover (Pervan & Višić, 2012) to be influential factors of
that type. However, surprisingly little research has been done focusing on a firm’s risk
level as an additional factor, even though the importance of a firm’s riskiness to, for
example, a firm’s financing possibilities has been highlighted by previous research (e.g.,
Pissarides, 1999; Cassar & Holmes, 2003). In fact, the study by Li et al. (2019) was, in a
way, pioneering, since they were the first ones, who examined a firm’s risk level as a
moderating factor in the relationship between capital structure and financial performance.
Li et al. (2019) based their hypothesis of firm’s risk level as moderating factor on the
principal-agent-problem. As noted before, the principal-agent-problem, proposed by
Jensen and Meckling (1976), means a situation, where two different parties have different
priorities and act according to them, resulting in so called agency costs. In general, in a
firm exists two types of agency conflicts. Firstly, between managers and shareholders as
a result of the separation of ownership and control and, secondly, between debt holders
and equity holders as a result of increased outside debt financing. However, previous
research has argued the impact of leverage to the principal-agent problem, especially, as
23

in a firm exist two types of agency conflicts. Whereas a set of studies suggest that a higher
leverage can reduce the agency conflict between managers and shareholders (e.g., Ang,
Cole & Lin, 2000), a number of studies suggest that by decreasing the leverage the agency
cost between debt holders and equity holders can be reduced (e.g., Niu, 2008). As can be
observed, a contradiction exists and, consequently, whether a firm increases or decreases
its leverage, at least one type of agency cost seems to exist. Furthermore, this leads to the
question whether higher leverage increases or decreases the agency costs.
In general, the implicit assumption is that, in the imperfect market conditions, the value
of a firm decreases if the agency costs are likely to be realized (Florackis, 2008).
Therefore, the agency costs should have a negative relationship with profitability, as if
the agency cost are realized, profitability and, consequently, the firm value, will drop. As
previous research suggests that higher leverage simultaneously increases and decreases
agency costs, affecting profitability, in this study’s context should be considered how
much the profitability is increased with decreased agency costs between managers and
shareholders as well as how much the profitability is decreased with increased agency
costs between debt and equity holders.
However, as higher leverage has been indicated to simultaneously increase and decrease
agency costs, it can be argued if the effect of agency cost on profitability is always similar
and independent of the firm’s risk of business failure. Li et al. (2019) approached this
problem by arguing the value of monitoring firms for borrowers with different business
failure risk levels. This objective was more suitable in their study, as the focus was on
SMEs, for which outside debt has been observed to be the main financing method and,
additionally, the ownership is usually more concentrated reducing the agency cost
between managers and shareholders. Nevertheless, since the focus of the study is on listed
companies, the dilemma is approached from shareholders’ perspective, as they have an
important role in financing listed firms and, in addition, the agency cost between
managers and shareholders are assumed to be more actual, due to the separation of
ownership.
The shareholders’ monitoring can be done with several mechanisms and despite of the
chosen one, the purpose is to achieve profitability (Agrawal & Knoeber, 1996). However,
firms with low risk of business failure are seen as more transparent with a better ability
to control their environment (Li et al., 2019), which means that monitoring of these firms

24

is not giving an extra value for shareholders. Furthermore, firms with low risk of business
failure have been observed to have a better ability to generate profits (e.g., Altman, 1968,
591), hence the impact of monitoring on profitability and the interest of shareholders to
monitor these firms is assumed to be lower. Therefore, although firms with low risk of
business failure have high leverage, the monitoring of these firms is not assumed to give
an extra value for shareholders, as the profitability of the firms will not increase
remarkably.
However, if these firms have higher leverage, according to Jensen (1986), they suffer
from reduced free cash flows due to increased debt payments that limit their daily
operating activities. Consequently, similarly as Li et al. (2019) argued, when a low-risk
firm has a high leverage, the increase in profitability achieved by shareholders’
monitoring should be lower than the decrease in profitability caused by reduced free cash
flows. More closely, an increase in profitability achieved by reduced agency costs
between managers and shareholders should be weaker than a decrease in profitability
caused by the agency costs between debt holders and equity holders.
On the contrary, the effect can be argued to be opposite in firms with high risk of business
failure. Since high-risk firms have usually a higher likelihood to suffer from managerial
problems as well as to have weaker control systems (Li et al., 2019), potential benefits
can be reached by shareholders’ monitoring. Furthermore, in firms with high risk of
business failure the ability to generate profits have been observed to be weaker (Altman,
1968,), hence the effect of monitoring on profitability and, additionally, the interest of
shareholders towards the monitoring is assumed to be stronger. Therefore, when a high
leverage occurs in firms with high risk of business failure, potential benefits can be
reached by shareholders’ monitoring. Likewise, the effect of reduced free cash flows on
daily operating activities as a result of the higher leverage may be less important if the
effects on profitability achieved by the monitoring are remarkable enough.
Thus, for a high-risk firm with a high leverage, the increase in profitability achieved by
shareholders’ monitoring is assumed to be greater than the decrease in profitability caused
by reduced free cash flows. In conclusion, an increase in profitability achieved by
reduced agency costs between managers and shareholders should be stronger than a
decrease in profitability caused by the agency cost between debt holders and equity
holders. Thereby, according to the discussion above, the following hypothesis is formed:

25

H1: A firm’s level of business failure risk affects the direction of the relationship
between the firm’s capital structure and profitability

Furthermore, as the focus of this study is on Finnish listed companies, it brings another
aspect to discussion. Finnish firms have been argued to be primarily privately held
(Karjalainen, 2011) or owned by large institutional owners (Kasanen et al., 1996, 285286). Consequently, the ownership is more concentrated reducing the agency costs
between managers and shareholders. Additionally, as discussed before, Finnish firms are
already greatly leveraged due to bank-dominated financial markets (Niskanen &
Niskanen, 2006). Consequently, the effect of an additional increase in agency cost
between debt holders and equity holders on profitability may be weaker, as the free cash
flows are already greatly limited with existing debt payments. Moreover, due to strict
standards regarding the Finnish firms’ risk disclosures, the quality of firms’ governance
is concerned to be top-class in Finland (Miihkinen, 2013, 313), hence the stakeholders
should be well informed about the financial situation in the firms, reducing both types of
agency costs. As a result, the above hypothesized effects of business failure risk on the
relationship between capital structure and profitability may be weaker, as the agency costs
are assumed to be lower in the Finnish markets.

4 METHODOLOGY
In this chapter, the research method, research design, and data for this thesis will be
presented. Furthermore, the theoretical background regarding the research techniques will
be overviewed as well as the variables chosen for the study will be introduced. Finally,
reliability and validity of the study will be discussed.

4.1 Research methodology
This study follows the positivist research approach. According to Slevitch (2011) the
positivist research approach lies on the belief of the ultimate truth that can be examined
objectively, without a possibility that researcher influences the research object or is
influenced by it. She continues that the aim of positivist research is to find the truth that
can be generalized by relying on already existing theories. Furthermore, a traditional
positivist research is defined as a rational and deductive process (Laughlin, 1995, 73), as
the conclusions are usually reached as a result of logical process, but a positivist research
may also have an inductive approach.
As the positivist research approach is followed in this study, the purpose of the study is
examined objectively without affecting or to be affected by it. Furthermore, a deductive
research approach is used by utilizing existing theories, previous research, and empirical
observations in developing the hypothesis and conclusions. Moreover, the purpose of the
study can be defined as explanatory since this study seeks to find a relationship between
the risk of business failure and the effect of capital structure to profitability. According
to Bryman and Bell (2011), a research purpose may also be exploratory or descriptive if
the study focuses more on these research possibilities.

4.2 Research design
As the purpose of the study is explanatory, seeking to confirm the effect of business
failure risk on the relationship between capital structure on profitability, a hypothesis is
developed based on existing theories, previous research, and empirical observations. The
hypothesis suggests that a firm’s level of business failure risk affects the direction of the
27

relationship between capital structure and profitability. More closely, the hypothesis is
based on the assumption that in firms with low risk of business failure financial leverage
is negatively related to profitability, while in firms with high risk of business failure
financial leverage is positively related to profitability.
To test the hypothesis in the empirical context, a regression analysis is conducted. A
regression analysis is chosen as a research technique in this study since previous research
extensively has used regression analysis to examine a relationship between variables. For
example, Li et al. (2019), a study similar to this study, used regression analysis to examine
the effect of credit risk on the relationship between capital structure and firm
performance. In general, a regression analysis measures how a dependent variable is
affected by changes in independent variable (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019, 443), which in
context of this study means that profitability is used as a dependent variable and capital
structure as an independent variable. The risk of business failure is used as a control
variable in order to see if it has an effect on the relationship, and, furthermore, a set of
additional control variables are used in order to control variables that have been proven
to affect the relationship. This research design enables to examine if the proposed
hypothesis is true in this study’s empirical context and, furthermore, it enables to make
further conclusions of achieved results. However, a more comprehensive review of
research process will be presented in section 4.4.

4.3 Data
The purpose of the study is to contribute the existing research by examining the research
topic in a different environment compared to prior research, hence listed firms are chosen
as a research object in this study. Furthermore, Finnish listed firms are chosen as the
object of the study since Finland offers an interesting environment to examine the aim of
the study, due to its bank-oriented financing system and the little size of the capital
markets. Thereby, the data consists of firms listed at the Helsinki Stock Exchange
(OMXH). The selected research period for the study is fiscal years 2015-2019, in order
to capture the effect of business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure
and profitability as extensively as possible. However, the research period is limited to
fiscal years 2015-2019, partly as a consequence of data availability reasons, but also to
keep the research design cross-sectional and to minimize possible longitudinal
28

characteristics in the sample. To improve the quality of data by removing outliers and
checking possible biases, Microsoft Excel is utilized, while the actual analyzing of the
data is conducted with IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).

4.3.1 Data collection process
This study relies mainly on accounting data, but as previous research has suggested the
use of auditing data in the business failure prediction (e.g., Laitinen & Laitinen, 2009;
Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al., 2020), data of firms’ audit reports were also gathered. The main
source for the data collection was the Amadeus Database of Bureau van Dijk, which
includes financial data and business information of European firms. The Voitto+-software
was used as a complement data source because data availability reasons limited the use
of the Amadeus Database to some extent. The Voitto+-software includes financial
information and data of audit reports of Finnish firms, broadening the amount of available
data.
The initial sample consisted of 155 firms. However, this sample included, for example,
certain already delisted firms and firms that had merged or changed their names, causing
duplicates in the sample. The delisted firms were excluded from the sample, as the
possibility to gather data of them was restricted. Furthermore, the merged firms and the
firms that had changed their names were controlled in order to count the actual number
of firms. Also, previous research has suggested the exclusion of financial firms (e.g., Li
et al., 2019) due to their different business environment that may cause biased results.
These firms were already excluded from the initial sample, as the Amadeus Database has
no data of firms in the financial sector.
Additionally, the number of firms listed at the Helsinki Stock Exchange has varied during
the research period, which affects the sample size in form of firm-year observations. As
discussed above, the delisted firms were excluded from the sample due to the data
restrictions, but the initial sample included certain firms that had been listed to the stock
exchange during the research period. As the interest of this study is on the listed firms,
only fiscal years when a firm had been listed were considered in this study. As a result,
firm-year observations from the period before listing were excluded from the sample.
Moreover, as unlisted firms in Finland are allowed to compose a financial statement
29

without publishing it, firms that had been listed during the research period often missed
financial statements of the fiscal years before listing, which could have caused biased
results.
Furthermore, certain firms missed data for no specific reason, potentially, due to the lack
of data in the databases. However, the missing values seemed to occur randomly, which
is why they were merely excluded from the sample reducing the number of firm-year
observations. If the missing values had occurred, for example, in a particular branch or a
particular year, possible reasons for that would have been searched and, likely, the biased
branches or years would have been excluded from the sample. After controlling for the
missing values, the sample size was 560 firm-year observations consisting of 130 firms.

4.3.2 Data treatment
After the data were collected, the data set was controlled in case of biases and outliers.
As the Finnish markets are small, the possibility of biased data is relatively high compared
to, for example, the US markets. This was seen as a possible problem in this study as well,
as only 129 firms were listed at the Helsinki Stock Exchange at the time of conducting
the study. A multi-year research period reduced the problems related to the small sample
to some extent, but the fact that the same firms were presentative each year still existed.
As a result, the data was skewed and had abnormal kurtosis, including certain extreme
values that violated the normality of data. Since regression analysis requires the data set
to follow normal distribution (John, 1995), possible biases in the data set were analyzed
and certain statistical techniques were used to improve the normality of data.
Firstly, possible biases in the sample were considered. As discussed before, the possible
bias of missing values raised interest at first, but as the missing values seemed to occur
randomly in the study’s sample, this possible bias was omitted in the study. Likewise, a
possibility for the survivorship bias was observed in the sample. As the listed firms
recorded in the Amadeus Database consisted only of firms that were listed in the Helsinki
Stock Exchange at time of conducting the study, the firms that have been delisted in the
Helsinki Stock Exchange during the research period were excluded from the study. This
resulted in a possible bias in the sample, as the firms that have gone bankrupt during the
research period are consequently absent. In conclusion, this could result in skewness, as
30

only firms that have surviewed throughout the whole research period were present in the
sample, which was the case in this study also. Furthermore, this may affect the results of
the study since bankrupt firms usually have a high risk of business failure few years before
the bankruptcy. Thereby, the number of firms with a high risk of business failure was
assumed to be smaller in this study compared to actual situation.
Secondly, the ultimate extreme values were excluded from the sample, as these were
observed to violate the normality of data set. According to John (1995), these so-called
outliers are observations that differ from the same model as the rest of data and may
remarkably affect the linear regression. Regardless, outliers should be removed carefully,
as they can include valuable data regarding the study. Therefore, the aim of controlling
outliers is to remove as few outliers as possible to improve the normality of data, without
violating the external validity of the study’s results. This may lead into a trade-off
situation, in which the extra value of an outlier and the negative effect of an outlier to the
functionality of regression model are considered.
In general, several methods for removing the outliers from the sample exist, but
according to John (1995), two of them are most widely used by statisticians:
accommodation and identification/rejection. In the accommodation method, an objective
function is used in order to decline the effect of outliers. This means that an objective
function decreases the effect of outliers in the sample, but it still allows them to influence
the regression line. In comparison, in the identification/rejection method, outliers are
identified in the sample and are removed directly, preventing the outliers to affect the
regression line. In this study, the identification/rejection method was used, since it was
considered a most suitable method for the sample. As the sample was relatively small,
certain outliers had a strong impact to the fit of the regression line reducing the validity
of the study. Therefore, removing of outliers was observed as more effective method to
improve the fit of the regression line than diminishing of the effects of outliers.
Furthermore, the identification/rejection method allowed to analyze each outlier case-bycase, which is important with small sample, as certain outlier may contain valuable data
regarding the study.
To support the identification and removing of outliers the Interquartile Range Method
was applied in the study. This method utilizes the interquartile range (IQR) of
standardized data to determine upper and lower boundaries for values that are considered

31

as outliers. According to Barbato, Barini, Genta, and Levi (2011) the IQR of data is
defined as the range of standardized data between the lower 25% (Q1) and upper 75%
(Q3) of the sample, covering the central 50% of data. Based on the IQR, upper and lower
boundaries for outliers per continuous variable are defined, meaning that observations
that fall outside of these boundaries are defined as outliers. According to Barbato et al.
(2011) the boundaries for outliers can be calculated as following:
𝐼𝑄𝑅 = 𝑄3 − 𝑄1
𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 = 𝑄3 + (1,5 × 𝐼𝑄𝑅)
𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 = 𝑄1 − (1,5 × 𝐼𝑄𝑅)
The IQR method offers a purely objective technique to identify and remove outliers.
According to Barbato et al. (2011) the popularity of the method is based on its simplicity
and low sensitivity to distortion, hence it was applied in this study as well. However, as
all methods, the IQR method has also its drawbacks. Whereas the IQR method is purely
objective, it is relatively crude method to identify outliers. As Barbato et al. (2011)
remark, it omits, for example, the sample size as well as the specific conditions regarding
the study, which may affect the results of the study. On the contrary, by using the IQR
method the fit of the data can be bettered, which will result in more reliable results when
applying the linear regression model.
After identification of the boundaries for extreme values per continuous variables, the
values that were identified as outliers were rejected from the sample. As a result, the
sample size was reduced into 452 firm year observations. The IQR boundaries for the
variables can be found in Appendix 1.

4.4 Research method
A regression analysis is conducted in order to confirm the truthfulness of the proposed
hypothesis. A regression analysis is widely used technique in positivist research tradition
to examine a relationship between two variables, particularly, how a dependent variable
is affected by changes in independent variable (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019, 443). In the
simplest form of regression analysis, called the simple linear regression model, the effect
of changes in one independent variable to a dependent variable is examined. The simple
32

linear regression model supposes a straight-line relationship between the mean value of
the dependent variable and the value of the independent variable forming a following
equation (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019):
Ŷ = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑋 + 𝜀
In the equation, Ŷ is defined as the predicted value of the dependent variable, α as the
intercept or constant coefficient, X as the independent variable, β as the coefficient for the
effect of X to Y, and ε as the error term. The error term is defined as the difference between
the real value of Y and predicted value Ŷ, and it catches the changes of Y that are
unexplainable with the selected independent variable(s). The error term is also called as
a residual. Residuals are exploited in the OLS-regression that is one of the most widely
used method in the regression analysis. The ordinary least square (OLS) method is built
on an assumption that the coefficients α and β are estimated in such a way that the sum
of the squares of the residuals is the smallest possible, forming a linear line between
observations. (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019)
However, rarely in practice a phenomenon happens as a result of one variable affecting
to the dependent variable. Rather several variables exist that may explain the changes in
the dependent variable, which is often the case in the modern positivist research as well.
Thereby, a model that confirms a relationship between a dependent variable and several
explanatory variables is needed. So-called multiple linear regression analysis enables to
examine this particular dilemma by forming a linear regression line between a
dependent variable and several explanatory variables (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019). The
equation takes the following form:
Ŷ = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑋1 + 𝛽2 𝑋2 + 𝛽3 𝑋3 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑛 𝑋𝑛 + 𝜀
As well as in the simple linear regression model, Ŷ is defined as the predicted value of the
dependent variable, α as the intercept or constant coefficient and ε as the error term.
However, the multiple linear regression model includes several explanatory variables
(𝑋1 , 𝑋2 … 𝑋𝑛 ) in the model which effect on the dependent variable, Y, is described with
the coefficients 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 … 𝛽𝑛 (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019).

Nevertheless, often in the

positivist research the focus is on a certain relationship, meaning that the effect of one of
the explanatory variables on the dependent variable is set as a target of the research.
Hence, the explanatory variable under the research is called as an independent variable

33

and the other explanatory variables as control variables since they have to be controlled
in order to confirm the particular relationship.
In order to ensure that unbiased results can be achieved with a regression model, certain
assumptions have to be fulfilled when conducting the study. Fávero and Belfiore (2019,
480, 488) define these assumptions as following: residuals follow normal distribution, no
high correlation occurs between variables, residuals are random and independent, and
residuals are uncorrelated with the independent variables, i.e., equal variance between
error term and independent variables exist. All assumptions except the last one must hold
in order to achieve unbiased estimates with the model. If the last assumption, also known
as homoskedasticity, does not hold, it rather affects the efficiency of the estimate than the
estimator bias. Therefore, due to the limited possibilities of this study, a possible
heteroskedasticity is not considered. However, to improve the quality of the results,
controls for the normality of residuals and the high correlation between variables are
conducted in form of the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Pearson’s correlation matrix. On the
contrary, the randomness and the independency of residuals is seen as a possible problem,
as the used dataset is cross-sectional. However, the problem is sought to diminish, for
example, by limiting the research period.

4.4.1 Dependent variable
Profitability is used as a dependent variable since the interest of this study is in how
changes in capital structure affects profitability in firms with different business failure
risk levels. Referring to the discussion in section 2.1, profitability can be measured in
several ways and from different standpoints resulting in a wide scale of profitability
measures. However, as this study is interested in the effects on overall profitability in
firms, a measure for profitability that supports this perspective is chosen as a proxy for
profitability. To capture the changes in overall profitability, previous research has
exploited mainly a set of profitability ratios (e.g., Trujillo-Ponce, 2012). However, as the
research setting of this study is wanted to be kept as simple as possible, only one measure
that best captures the overall effect on profitability is chosen as a proxy for profitability.
Since profitability is defined as an ability to generate profits with firm’s resources, ratio
that capture this effect as comprehensively as possible is seen as the most suitable ratio
34

for measuring profitability in this study. In general, accounting literature has suggested
to use of such ratios as return on assets (ROA) and profit margin in profitability analysis,
as ROA measures the firm’s ability to generate profits with its assets and profit margin
announces the ability to control cost incurred to generate the profits (Fairfield & Yohn,
2012, 371-372). These aspects are seen as most important factors for a firm’s profitability,
but since this study is more interested in the firm’s ability to generate profits with its
resources, ROA is chosen as a proxy for profitability. Noticeably, previous research has
argued against the ability of these measures to forecast future profitability (e.g., Fairfield
& Yohn, 2012), but this perspective is omitted in this study, as the aim of the study is
only to note the effects on profitability.
As profitability is the dependent variable in this study, the proxy for profitability, ROA,
is defined as the variable Y and calculated with following equation that is widely used by
previous research:
𝑌=

𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

4.4.2 Independent variables
As the effect of changes in capital structure in firms with different level of business
failure risk is examined in this study, capital structure is defined as one of the
independent variables. The term capital structure refers to possibilities for a firm to
finance its resources. In general, financing can be done either with equity or debt, hence
a ratio of them is used widely to measure the capital structure. The ratio is called as
leverage and is used as a primary proxy for capital structure by previous research.
However, different variations to calculate leverage exist, especially, as accounting
regulation varies to some extent between countries. Thereby, following, for example, Li
et al. (2019) and Chen (2004) leverage is defined as the book-debt ratio and calculated
with the following equation:
𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 =

𝐿𝑜𝑛𝑔 − 𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

35

In the equation, only long-term debt is included as the interest is in the firm’s long-term
financing. Furthermore, only the book value of the total assets is considered in the
equation.
The second independent variable used in the study is the risk of business failure.
Following Li et al. (2019) business failure risk is defined as an indicator variable, meaning
that it equals 1 if the firm has a high risk of business failure and 0 otherwise. As presented
in section 2.4, previous research has introduced a comprehensive selection of different
measures for risk of business failure. However, the business failure prediction models that
combine traditional measures based on accounting data with non-financial data have been
observed to have a better prediction accuracy than either of components alone.
Particularly, promising results have been achieved by combining traditional measures
with audit data, as it includes valuable information regarding a firm’s risk of business
failure. Thereby, a measure combining accounting data with audit data is used as a proxy
for the risk of business failure in this study.
The measure chosen to predict the risk of business failure in this study is similar with the
measure used in the study by Muñoz‐Izquierdo et al. (2020). They complemented the
Altman Z-score model with the information of audit reports and achieved approximately
87% business failure prediction accuracy among Spanish firms. The information they
used to complement the Altman Z-score model was the audit opinion, the number of
disclosures included, and the content of those disclosures. However, due to the data
availability and temporal reasons, only auditors’ statements are concerned in this study
as they were available in the Voitto+-database.
The procedure to determine firms’ risk of business failure starts with the calculation of
the Altman Z-score for the firms included in the sample. Following Altman (1968) the Zscore for firms is calculated with following equation:

36

𝑍 = 1,2𝑋1 + 1,4𝑋2 + 3,3𝑋3 + 0,6𝑋4 + 𝑋5
where
𝑋1 = 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙⁄𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑋2 = 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠⁄𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑋3 = 𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡𝑎𝑥 (𝐸𝐵𝐼𝑇)⁄𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑋4 = 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦⁄𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠
𝑋5 = 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠⁄𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

According to Altman (1968), if a firm’s Z-score is equal or lower than 1.8, it is likely that
the firm will face a business failure during upcoming years. Likewise, if a firm has Zscore higher than 1.8, business failure is seen unlikely for the firm. Thereby, if a firm’s
Z-score is equal or lower than 1.8, the firm will be classified as a high-risk firm directly.
Moreover, the Z-score is complemented with auditor’s statement. If a firm has the Z-score
higher than 1.8, but it has a remark or remarks left in the audit report, the firm will be
classified as a high-risk firm. However, this should be most unlikely as audit reports
should advise stakeholders about any potential signals of business failure (Mutchler,
1984) and financial statements should reflect the firm’s financial situation. To summarize,
a firm is classified as a high-risk firm if it has Altman Z-score equal or lower than 1.8
and/or its auditor’s statement has a remark or remarks. Similarly, if a firm’s Altman Zscore is greater than 1.8 and its auditor’s statement is clear of remarks, a firm is defined
as a low-risk firm in this study.

4.4.4 Control variables
In order to specifically examine the effect of firm’s business failure risk on the
relationship between capital structure and profitability, a set of control variables is applied
in the study. As profitability is a sum of actions and resources that lead to success in
business, capital structure is only a piece in the puzzle. Therefore, the other characteristics
that previous research has proven to affect profitability are included in the regression
model as control variables. This allows to reduce the unexplained variation (measured
37

with error term) in regression model and, consequently, the model can interpret more
precise results.

Firm size
The first control variable is firm size. Whereas larger firms have been argued to have a
totally different business environment as they have a more comprehensive set of
possibilities to improve profitability due to economies of scale (Pervan & Višić, 2012,
214), for smaller firms these possibilities seem to be limited. Previous research has
explained this phenomenon with financial, organizational, and technical reasons. For
example, relying on reduced information asymmetry, larger firms have better possibilities
to finance their resources (Vermoesen et al., 2012, 436) and, furthermore, have more
potential to employ debt (Ojah & Manrique, 2005) resulting in multiple possibilities and
resources to improve profitability compared to smaller firms. Therefore, firm size is seen
as an affecting factor to profitability and is included in the regression model as a control
variable. Following numerous studies (e.g., Li et al., 2019; Lappalainen & Niskanen,
2012) firm size is defined as following:
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 = ln(𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠)

Firm age
The second control variable is firm age. According to Lappalainen and Niskanen (2012)
firm age is one of the most widely examined independent variables to affect firm
performance and profitability. Certain studies suggest a positive relationship between
firm age and profitability, as more mature firms have been argued to have the cuttingedge in markets relying on gained routines and the organizational determination (Coad,
Holm, Krafft, & Quatraro, 2018), but also the opposite results have been introduced. For
example, Roper (1999) found firm age to negatively affect profitability. However, despite
the type of the effect on profitability, firm age has been proven to affect profitability,
hence it is included in the regression model as a control variable. Following, for example,
Li et al. (2019) and Lappalainen and Niskanen (2012) firm age is defined with the
following equation:
𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑚 𝑎𝑔𝑒 = ln(1 + 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)
38

An additional year is included in the calculation as its impact diminishes when the firm
gets older (Lappalainen & Niskanen, 2012) and, thereby, the possible problem of age
equal to 0 can be avoided.

Patents and trademarks
The third control variable is patents and the fourth trademarks. These two variables are
related to a firm’s innovativeness that has been observed to affect profitability. For
example, Lööf and Heshmati (2006) found innovative firms, defined as firms with
investments to R&D-activities and with recently released products, to have better firm
performance and profitability compared to non-innovative firms. The results can be
interpreted with an assumption that firms with an ability to create, for example, new
products or ways to make business, can usually achieve a competitive advantage in the
market and, thereby, gain profits relying on it. Therefore, innovativeness should be
considered in the regression model as it has been proven to affect profitability.
Since innovativeness is only a control variable in this study, gathering data of R&Dinvestments for each firm during the whole research period is seen time-consuming.
Consequently, following Li et al. (2019) innovativeness is divided into two control
variables: patents and trademarks. As the data of both these variables are easily available
in the Amadeus Database, inclusion of these two separates variables is seen most suitable
for the research setting of this study. Furthermore, by including two separate variables of
innovativeness, the effect of innovativeness can be controlled more precisely. In fact,
larger firms are more likely to earn patents and trademarks compared to smaller firms,
consequently combining of these two variables could result in a sample in which almost
each firm would be classified as innovative. This would make innovativeness as a
negligible control variable, hence dividing innovativeness into two control variables is
seen reasonable.
Following Li et al. (2019) both patents and trademarks are defined as indicator variables,
meaning that if a firm has earned at least one patent/trademark in the year, the variable
equals 1, otherwise it equals 0. These control variables can be impressed also with
following equations:

39

𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑠𝑗 = [1𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑘𝑠=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑠 ≠𝑗 ]
𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑗 = [1𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 ≠𝑗 ]

Asset turnover
The fifth control variable is asset turnover. According to Pervan and Višić (2012) asset
turnover allows to measure a company’s asset productivity, namely, how efficiently the
company use its assets to generate sales. As the ability to generate sales is associated with
the ability of generate profits, previous research has argued asset turnover to affect
profitability. Therefore, it is included in the regression model. Following, for example,
Pervan and Višić (2012) and Li et al. (2019) asset turnover is defined as:
𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 =

𝑂𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠

In the equation, the net assets is defined as following:
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 − 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠

Industry dummy
To see the potential differences between industries, a dummy variable, describing the
industry, is included in the regression model. As the firms listed at the Helsinki Stock
Exchange operate in different industries, the industry dummy variable can offer an
interesting information about the variation of results between industries and, additionally,
accounts for possible industry specific bias that might disturb the regression model and,
consequently, affect the results of the study. The industry dummy variable is an indicator
variable that equals 1 if the firm operates in the branch in the question and 0 otherwise.
The variable is based on 1-digit Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC) codes and the
industry classifications can be found in Appendix 2.
𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑗 = [1𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 ≠𝑗 ]

4.4.5 Interaction variable
A multiple regression analysis examines the relationship between a dependent and several
independent variables. However, the regression model itself omits to measure how a
particular independent variable affects the relationship between another independent
variable and the dependent variable. As the aim of this study is to examine the effect of
business failure risk on the relationship between capital structure and profitability, a
separate variable is needed in order to account this effect in the regression model.
In a regression model, a situation when two or more variables interact among each other
in the determination of a dependent variable is called interaction (Allison, 1977). More
closely, interaction means a situation where the effect of an independent variable on a
dependent variable depends on the level of another independent variable. In order to
specifically examine this effect, a control variable of the product of two independent
variables that interact, has to be included in the regression model (Allison, 1977). In this
study’s context, interaction is assumed to occur between leverage and risk of business
failure as it is hypothesized that the risk of business failure determines the effect of capital
structure on profitability. Therefore, an interaction variable is created in order to account
the effects of possible interaction between them. Following Li et al. (2019) the interaction
variable is determined as following:
𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 × 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘
As an interaction variable is a product of two independent variables, inclusion of an
interaction variable in a regression model changes interpretation of these two independent
variables as well. In general, inclusion changes the coefficients for the independent
variables used as terms in the interaction variable, thus the coefficient for the interaction
variable has to be summed up with the coefficient of the independent variable when the
wanted condition is met. In this study’s context, the interaction variable is a product of a
continuous (leverage) and a categorial (risk) variable. As the categorial variable, namely
risk variable, can only take values equal to 0 or 1, the interaction effect is only present
when risk variable equals one. Consequently, when the risk variable equals one, the effect
of leverage on profitability is sum of the coefficients for leverage and interaction.

4.4.6 Regression models
Based on the variable descriptions, the regression models can be now specified. The
regression models are based on the theory as well as variable descriptions above and used
as tools to either validate or reject the research hypotheses presented in chapter 3.2. To
test the hypotheses of this study, following regression models are estimated from the
sample:
Model 1:
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽4 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖 +
𝛽5 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽6 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽7 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝛽8 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

Model 2:
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖 × 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘𝑖 +
𝛽4 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽5 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖 + 𝛽6 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽7 𝑃𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 + 𝛽7 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖
+ 𝛽8 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑦 𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

As can be observed, the models are similar apart from the interaction variable in the model
2. The interaction variable is included in the model 2 in order to account the possible
effect of interaction between leverage and risk of business failure and, consequently, to
examine if business failure risk affects the relationship between capital structure and
profitability.

4.4.7 Univariate comparisons tests
In addition to the regression analysis, univariate comparison tests are performed in order
to compare firms’ business environments. As firms are classified into groups of high and
low risk of business failure, it enables to evaluate possible differences between the groups.
The evaluation of possible differences between firms offers knowledge of the research
area that is valuable itself but, additionally, it may offer supportive results for the
regression analysis. Since the hypothesis of the study is based on the assumption of
42

differences in business environments between high and low-risk firms, verifying the
differences in firm characteristics may offer further support for the hypothesis.
To test possible differences in firm characteristics with respect to the level of business
failure risk, univariate tests are conducted for all the variables used in the regression
analysis except the risk variable. As the variables used in the regression analysis consist
of, both continuous and discrete variables, two types of univariate comparisons tests are
needed. Of the univariate comparison tests the Mann-Whitney U-test is used for the
continuous variables, while Pearson’s Chi-Square is used for the discrete variables. These
tests are chosen to be conducted due to their popularity and appropriateness for the sample
of the study.
According to Fávero and Belfiore (2019, 281) the Mann-Whitney U-test is seen as a nonparametric version of the t-test. Compared to the t-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test verifies
the equality of the medians of two independent populations, which means that normally
distributed data is not required. In conclusion, the null hypothesis assumes the medians
of both populations, measured as ranks, to be equal. Following Fávero and Belfiore (2019,
281) the Mann-Whitney U-test is defined as:
𝑈𝑐𝑎𝑙 = min (𝑈1 , 𝑈2 )
where
𝑈1 = 𝑁1 × 𝑁2 +

𝑁1 × (𝑁1 + 1)
− 𝑅1
2

𝑈2 = 𝑁1 × 𝑁2 +

𝑁2 × (𝑁2 + 1)
− 𝑅2
2

and N1 is the sample size with the smallest number of observations, N2 is the sample size
with the largest number of observations, and R1,2 is the sum of the ranks for the respective
samples.
In contrast, according to Fávero and Belfiore (2019, 276), Pearson’s Chi-square test
compares the frequencies observed in the sample to the expected frequencies. If a
significant difference between observed and expected frequencies exists, the null
hypothesis can be rejected. Following Fávero and Belfiore (2019, 276) Pearson’s Chisquare test is defined as:

43

𝐼

𝐽

(𝑂𝑖𝑗 − 𝐸𝑖𝑗 )2
𝜒 = ∑∑
𝐸𝑖𝑗
2

𝑖=1 𝑗=1

where Oij is number of observations in the category i of variable X and the category j of
variable Y, Eij is expected frequency of observations in the same categories, and I is the
number of categories of variable X, while J is the number of categories of variable Y.

4.4.7 Secondary regression analysis
In order to verify the results achieved with the primary regression analysis, a secondary
regression analysis is conducted as well. As the measure of profitability can suffer from
measurement errors and, additionally, the results can be sensitive to presuppositions
related to OLS regression analysis (Li et al, 2019, 586), a binary logistic regression
analysis utilizing a dummy variable of profitability is conducted. According to Fávero
and Belfiore (2019, 540) with a binary logistic regression model a probability for the
occurrence of an event defined by Y can be examined based on the movements of
explanatory variables. However, they continue that this requires the Y to be in dichotomic
form as an event can either occur or not occur and, thus, by defining a vector of
explanatory variables, a binary logistic regression model can be defined as following:
𝑍𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑋1𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑋2𝑖 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘𝑖
As can be observed, the binary logistic regression model follows the OLS-regression to
large extent, hence a detailed explanation of the model is seen as unnecessary. However,
the term Yi is replaced with the term Zi in a binary logistic regression model and it is
defined as a natural logarithm of the chance for the occurrence of an event. Furthermore,
following Li et al. (2019) the dummy variable of profitability is created by comparing a
firm’s ROA to an industry median. If the firm’s ROA is greater than the industry median,
it takes value of 1 and 0 otherwise. In conclusion, the dummy variable of ROA can be
defined as following:
𝑅𝑂𝐴_𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦𝑗 = [1𝑅𝑂𝐴_𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦=𝑗 𝑜𝑟 0𝑅𝑂𝐴_𝑑𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑦 ≠𝑗 ]

44

4.5 Reliability and validity of the study
As the positivist research methodology strives for finding the truth, strict requirements
have been developed as a measure for the trustworthiness of a positivist study (Slevicth,
2012). These requirements cover the methods applied to examine the aim of the study as
well as the data used in the study. In general, the requirements regarding the research
methodology applied in the academic research are divided into reliability and validity of
the study, which will be discussed in following two sections.

4.5.1 Reliability
In general, with reliability is referred to the consistency of a study, in other words, the
possibilities of a study to be repeated in different circumstances offering similar results
(Roberts & Priest, 2006). Additionally, the results should be accurate, and the number of
hazardous results should be minimized (Heikkilä, 2014). Reliability can be defined with
three concepts: internal consistency, test-retest, and interrater (Roberts & Priest, 2006).
The internal consistency refers to the relationship between all the results achieved from a
single test, the test-retest the repeatability of the results in same circumstances, and the
interrater the independence of the research tool. These concepts can be measured with
certain tests, which is particularly important with research tools, such as, surveys in which
the results can be dependent on the questions designed by the researcher.
As can be observed above, reliability mainly refers to the repeatability of a study in the
positivist research. It is important that same method and models can be used by anybody
as well as that the study can be repeated in different circumstances. The research tool used
in this study is the regression analysis that is widely used in the positivist research
methodology to examine relationship between variables. Additionally, the regression
analysis has levered reliable results over the years, hence the reliability of the research
method is assumed to be on the sufficient level. Furthermore, to some extent this study
follows the study by Li et al. (2019) that has achieved reliable results, which strengthens
the reliability of the study.
However, as the data in the study consist only Finnish listed firms, the possibilities to
repeat the study are limited. By focusing on, for example, a different research period, the
study could be repeated with data of Finnish listed firms, but if the study was repeated in
45

other country or with data of firms in a different size class, modifications to the research
design and the regression models would be needed. According to Heikkilä (2014), the
reliability of a positivist study can be improved by ensuring that the sample in the study
is large and representative enough and that the data collection is done carefully. As the
focus of this study is on the Finnish listed firms, the condition of large enough sample
can be questioned, but the representativeness of the sample can be seen sufficient, as all
publicly listed firms are included. Furthermore, the data collection is done and presented
carefully in this study, facilitating the repeating of the study and, consequently, improving
the reliability of the study.

4.5.2 Validity
With validity is referred the accurate measurement of a concept in a positivist research
(Heale & Twycross, 2015). By that is meant that the concept should really measure what
it claims to measure, rather than, for example, certain side effects that may occur
simultaneously. In general, validity can be divided into internal and external validity. The
external validity refers to generalization of the findings of the study in different context,
whereas the internal validity highlights the reasons for the outcomes of the study (Roberts
& Priest, 2006). Both the internal and external validity can be evaluated with specified
concepts.
As the internal validity highlights the reasons for the outcomes of the study, it is focused
mainly on the variables in the study and the relationship between them. The internal
validity can be evaluated from three perspectives, namely, the perspectives of content
validity, construct validity, and criterion validity (Roberts & Priest, 2006). The content
validity refers to an ability of a research tool to comprehensively measure all aspects of
the desired concept or domain. In other words, it evaluates to which extent the instrument
catches the entire domain of a variable. Additionally, the construct validity refers to a
more specified measurement accuracy, i.e., how accurately the research tool measures the
desired concept itself. Lastly, the criterion validity evaluates how the research tool is
correlated with other tools that measure the same variables. To ensure the internal validity
of this study, previous research as well as prior literature regarding the focus of the study
has been reviewed. The development of the hypothesis as well as the choice of the
research tool and the variables are based on well-known theories and results achieved by
46

previous research. Even though thoroughly reviewing and following of previous research
usually improves the validity of a study, the validity of this study can be argued.
The criterion validity of the chosen research tool, namely, the regression analysis, is hard
to evaluate, as the ability of other research tools to examine relationship between variables
is lacking. However, the criterion validity of study can be evaluated by comparing the
results of the study to other similar studies. The construct validity of this study depends
most likely on the construct validity of previous research as this study follows widely
previous research in the choice of variables as well as measures for them. However, the
construct validity of previous research is not argued, hence the construct validity of this
study is assumed to be on sufficient level. In comparison, the content validity of this study
can be questioned. Whereas the regression analysis is observed to outperform in
examination of a specific relationship, the examination of all aspects of a domain with a
regression analysis is usually insufficient. Even though the choice of variables to the
regression model is based on previous research, incorporation of all affecting variables is
impossible and, furthermore, undesirable as the adding of variables to a regression model
reduces its explanation power.
On the contrary, the external validity offers a more broadened view to the validity. As
finding the truth and, thereby, generalization of results is main focus in the positivist
research tradition, the validity of a study is strongly related to these aspects. According
to Roberts and Priest (2006), in order to generalize the founded results or truth, three
conditions have to be fulfilled. Firstly, the conditions under which the study is performed
should be representative of the conditions to which the results will be applied. Secondly,
the sample of the study should represent the currently existing population. Thirdly, the
sample should consider the relevant variables in the study, representing all groups
occurring in the population. Even though a high internal validity usually also improves
the external validity, the external validity of the study can be argued.
As the focus of this study is on Finnish listed firms the generalization of the results and,
thereby, even the validity of the study is contradictory. Finnish markets offer an
interesting environment to perform the study, but referencing to section 2.7, it has its own
specialties. Therefore, the implementing of the results of the study in other countries
should be done carefully, as the business conditions may differ greatly. Furthermore, even
though the representativeness of the sample is concerned to be good for the Finnish listed

47

firms as it covers all firms listed at Helsinki Stock Exchange except few exclusions, the
results should be interpreted only by focusing on the Finnish listed firms due to reasons
mentioned above. Consequently, generalization of the study’s results can be done in
Finland or countries with a similar business environment. However, in the big picture
generalization of the study’s results is challenging, hence the value of the study is highest
for the Finnish enterprises.

5 ANALYSIS
This chapter will present the analysis results. First, descriptive statistics and correlations
between variables will be presented. Second, the results from the univariate comparison
tests will be introduced. Lastly, the results from the primary and secondary regression
analyses will be presented.

5.1 Descriptive statistics and normality of data
In the table 1 descriptive statistics and normality tests for the continuous variables are
presented. On the left side of the table 1 the number of observations, mean values,
standard deviations, minimum and maximum values as well as the values of skewness
and kurtosis for the variables are presented. Furthermore, on the right side of the table 1
the results of normality test, namely, Shapiro-Wilk test are presented.

In the table, number of observations, average values, standard deviations, minimum and
maximum values as well as the skewness and kurtosis for the variables are presented.
Additionally, the results from the Shapiro-Wilk test are presented.

As can be observed, ROA is 4,314 which indicates that on average profitability of Finnish
listed firms has been positive and, additionally, on a relatively high level between the
years 2015 and 2019. Leverage is 0,116 on average and the values appear between 0,000
and 0,426 which may indicate that Finnish listed firms are not so leveraged as predicted
based on discussion in section 2.6. Additionally, the variable of age is on average 3,405
and the variable of size 12,693 which means that, when reverted back to original values,
on average the age of Finnish listed firms is approximately 30 years and size measured as
total assets 325 462 thousand euros.
The values that especially raise interest in the table 1 are skewness and kurtosis, as by
exploring these values the normality of data can be evaluated. Both of these values
49

describe the shape of the data set: the skewness focuses to measure the asymmetry of the
data compared to normal distribution, whereas the kurtosis refers to the flatness level of
the data compared to normal distribution (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019, 61, 65). A value of
skewness close to zero implicates the symmetry of the data to be close to the normal
distribution, while a value of kurtosis close to three implicates the flatness level of the
data to be close to the normal distribution. However, the technique of calculating kurtosis
should be considered when interpreting the results. Statistical packages, like the SPSS or
Excel, subtract this pivotal value of three when measuring kurtosis, resulting in so-called
exceed kurtosis. Therefore, if results achieved with the SPSS show both the skewness and
kurtosis of the data to be close to zero, the data is assumed to be normally distributed.
However, as can be observed, the values of skewness and excess kurtosis are constantly
higher or lower than zero among variables. Only the variable of ROA shows the values
of skewness and excess kurtosis quite close to zero, hence it can be assumed to be closest
to a normally distributed data set of the continuous variables. The values of skewness
differing from zero indicate the data sets to be skewed either left or right: a positive
skewness indicates the data to be skewed on the left side, while a negative skewness
indicates the data to be skewed on the right side. Of the continuous variables leverage,
size and net turnover are skewed to the left, while age is skewed to the right and, as
interpreted earlier, ROA is closest to the normally distributed data set.
In comparison, the values of excess kurtosis differing from the zero indicate the data to
be flatter or taller compared to a normal distributed data set. A positive excess kurtosis,
also known as leptokurtosis, indicates a flatter data set, whereas a negative excess
kurtosis, also known as platykurtosis, indicates a taller data set compared to normally
distributed data set. Of the continuous variables size, age, and net turnover are
platykurtotic, whereas leverage is leptokurtotic and ROA is closest to a normally
distributed data set.
On the right side of the table 1 the results of the normality test, namely, the Shapiro-Wilk
test are presented. The Shapiro-Wilk test has as the null hypothesis that data is normally
distributed. The results show that the null hypothesis is rejected for all the continuous
variables, hence none of them is normally distributed. These results support the analysis
of skewness and kurtosis for the variables. Furthermore, as predicted, the variable of ROA
is closest to rejection of null hypothesis, hence it can be assumed to be closest to a normal

50

distributed data set. However, as none of the variables is normally distributed on a
statistically significant level, one of the basic assumptions for regression analysis is
violated, thus it has to be considered when interpreting the results.

5.2 Test of correlation
The table 2 presents the Pearson’s correlation matrix of the variables used in the
regression models. In general, a correlation refers to a variable’s reaction to the change
of another variable (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019), which is important to examine when
interpreting results of a regression analysis. Firstly, the correlation matrix announces
information about the expected relationships between variables, hence the motives behind
chosen variables can be evaluated. Secondly, the correlation matrix can reveal existing
multicollinearity between variables that may significantly affect the results of the
regression analysis as discussed earlier. The correlation coefficient obtains values
between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates identical changes between two variables and -1 the
opposite. A correlation coefficient equal to zero indicates no correlation between
variables.

In the table, correlations between variables are presented in form of the Pearson’s correlation
matrix.

In the second column of the table 2 the correlations between dependent and independent
variables are presented. The variables of leverage, risk, size, patents, and interaction
correlate with profitability on a statistically significant level, which indicates that the
ability of these variables to predict changes in profitability is relatively good. In contrast,
the correlations between profitability and the variables of age, trademarks, asset turnover,
51

and industry are statistically insignificant, which may indicate that the ability of these
variables to predict changes in profitability can be questioned. However, the statistically
significant negative correlation between the variables of risk and profitability was quite
expected based on the discussion in section 3.2. As a firm’s business failure risk is
expected to affect the firm’s business possibilities, it can be also assumed to affect the
firm’s profitability. The statistically significant positive correlations between profitability
and patents as well as size are also explainable due to competitive advantages achieved
with patents and economies of scale, as discussed in section 4.4.4. The insignificant
correlations between profitability and the variables of trademarks and asset turnover are
slightly unexpected as these variables are expected to affect profitability positively
relying on previous research. Furthermore, the correlations between profitability and
leverage as well as between profitability and age offer interesting results which contribute
to the existing research. Since previous research has achieved contradictory results, the
results of this thesis may offer valuable information about the effect of leverage and age
on profitability among Finnish listed firms.
Overall, the interaction variable shows the highest correlations among the variables. It
seems to correlate strongly with the variables of leverage and risk, which was quite
expected since the interaction variable consist of these two variables. The second highest
correlation can be found between the variables of risk and asset turnover. The high
negative correlation between the variables can be explained with high-risk firms’ reduced
business possibilities which is reflected in asset turnover as well. Additionally, the
correlations between profitability and risk as well as between size and patents are among
the highest which can be explained with high-risk firm’s reduced business possibilities
and larger firms’ greater possibilities to gain patents due to economies of scale.
However, none of the variables show particularly high correlation with another variable,
hence multicollinearity seems not to cause problems in this thesis. The correlations
between the interaction variable and the variables of risk and leverage are relatively high
compared to correlations between other variables, but as long as the correlation is on
sufficient level, multicollinearity is not considered as a problem. Furthermore, in the table
3 additional evidence against multicollinearity are presented. The table 3 presents
collinearity diagnostics of variables, namely, variance inflation factors (VIF) and
condition indexes. Both measures have critical values and if these critical values are
exceeded, a strong multicollinearity is indicated. With VIF the critical value is 10 and
52

with condition index 30. However, as can be observed, none of the variables exceed these
critical values, hence the regression models are assumed to be free of multicollinearity
problems.

5.3 Univariate comparison tests
In order to see potential differences between firms with high and low risk of business
failure, Pearson’s Chi-square tests and the Mann-Whitney U-test are performed. For the
discrete variables, the differences are examined with Pearson’s Chi-square test, while the
Mann-Whitney U-test is used for the continuous variables. The table 4 below presents
univariate comparisons within groups as well as the results of the Mann-Whitney U-test
for the continuous variables.

In the table, statistics of univariate comparisons within groups are presented in
form of medians and mean ranks. Additionally, the results from the Mann-Whitney
U-tests are presented.

53

As can be observed, differences between firms with high and low risk of business failure
exist and, importantly, according to the results of the Mann-Whitney U-test, all the
differences are statistically significant. The mean ranks of profitability and asset turnover
are greater for firms with low risk of business failure, which indicates that these firms
have higher profitability as well as higher asset turnover. In comparison, the ranks of
leverage are on average higher for the firms with high risk of business failure, which
indicates that high-risk firms have more leveraged capital structure compared to low-risk
firms. These results are supported with the median values and are in line with previous
research. However, also results that conflict previous research are found. The results show
the mean ranks of size and age to be slightly greater for the firms with a high risk of
business failure, which indicates the high-risk firms to be larger and older compared to
low-risk ones. These findings are interesting, as previous research has reached the
opposite results. Consequently, the results may offer valuable knowledge of Finnish listed
firms.

In the table, statistics of univariate comparisons within groups are presented in
form of differences in relative frequencies. Also, the results from the Pearson’s
Chi-square tests are presented.

The table 5 above presents relative frequencies of the discrete variables within groups as
well as the results of the Pearson’s Chi-square tests. Based on the calculations of business
failure risk, in total, 280 firms are defined as low-risk firms and 172 as high-risk firms.
Of the low-risk firms 38,57% have gained patents during the research period, while the
corresponding rate for the high-risk firms is 28,49%. The difference indicates that lowrisk firms have gained more patents compared to high-risk firms during the research
period and significancy of the difference is confirmed with the results of the Pearson’s
Chi-square test. In comparison, similar differences between groups are not observed in
the case of trademarks. As 8,57% of the low-risk firms and 8,14% of the high-risk firms
54

have gained trademarks during the research period, the difference between high and lowrisk firms is almost negligible. This is supported with the results of the Pearson’s Chisquare test. Additionally, the rate for gaining trademarks is relatively low compared to
the rate for gaining patents among both high and low-risk firms, which may expose
important information regarding the characteristics of these variables.

5.4 Regression analysis
In table 6 the results of the primary regression analysis, namely, OLS regression analysis
is presented. The results with both model 1 and model 2 are presented in the table 6. As
explained in the section 4.4.6, the model 1 reflects the relationship between profitability
and leverage as a whole, while model 2 accounts the possible effect of business failure
risk to the relationship between profitability and leverage.

In the table, coefficients for independent variables, the number of
observations, R-square values, and F-values are presented.

As can be observed, the coefficients are almost equal for variables in both models except
for the coefficients for leverage and risk. These coefficients are affected by the interaction
term in model 2 and will be analyzed later on. Both models suggest age and asset turnover
55

to affect profitability negatively, whereas size, patents, and trademarks seem to affect
profitability positively. The positive effect of size, patents, and trademarks on profitability
was quite predictable, but the negative effect of age and asset turnover on profitability
conflicts against previous research. Of the variables included in the regression models
only risk, size, and asset turnover are statistically significant on the 5% level, which
indicates the ability of these variables to predict changes in profitability to be better
compared to the other included variables. Furthermore, the results show the R-square
value of both models to be 0,203. In general, the R-square indicates how observation
points fit a regression line reflecting the ability of a model to predict changes in a
dependent variable (Fávero & Belfiore, 2019). The R-square is expressed as a percent,
which in this study’s context means that both model 1 and model 2 can predict 20,3% of
changes in profitability. Additionally, the F-values of the models are significant on the
1% level, which further provides the ability of independent variables to explain the
variation in profitability.
However, the most interesting results in the table 6 are coefficients for the variables of
leverage, risk, and interaction as these coefficients reveal the results regarding the aim of
the study. As can be observed, in model 1 leverage has a strong positive effect on
profitability. This means that higher leverage increases profitability in a firm, but as
model 1 accounts only the overall effect of leverage on profitability, a possible interaction
effect caused by risk of business failure is omitted. In comparison, when the interaction
effect of business failure risk is considered, leverage seems to be negatively related with
profitability as can be interpreted of the results achieved with model 2. These results
indicate that the interaction variable affects the coefficient of leverage, in other words,
the risk of business failure seems to affect the relationship between profitability and
leverage. Noticeably, the interaction variable is statistically insignificant in model 2 as
well as the R-square of model 2 is equal with the R-square of model 1. This indicates that
adding the interaction variable in the model does not improve the fit of the model
significantly. Consequently, the importance of interaction variable for the regression
model as well as the existence of interaction between leverage and risk can be questioned.

In the table, the effects of the independent variables on profitability
are presented considering the level of business failure risk.

Table 7 above is based on model 2 and presents the effects of the variables on profitability
considering the level of business failure risk. As the variable risk can either take a value
of zero, which indicates the firm to have low risk of business failure, or one, which
indicates the firm to have high risk of business failure, both outcomes are presented in the
table 6. As can be observed, when the variable of risk is equal to zero, the effect of
leverage on profitability is negative, while when the variable of risk is equal to 1, the
effect of leverage on profitability is positive. This is in line with the hypothesized effect
but as the results are statistically insignificant, the observed effect of business failure risk
is seen as random. Consequently, no further conclusions of the effect can be done.

5.5 Secondary regression analysis
In table 8 the results from the secondary regression analysis, namely, the binary logistic
regression analysis, are presented. The table 8 presents the results for both model 1 and
model 2. As discussed in section 4.4.7, the binary logistic regression analysis is used to
verify the results achieved with the primary regression analysis.
As can be observed from the table 8, the results achieved with the binary logistic
regression model partly support the results achieved with the OLS regression analysis,
but they also differ to some extent. The main objective of the study, i.e., the effect of
business failure risk seems to be similar with both techniques as the interaction variable
has a strong positive coefficient in the binary logistic regression model as well.
57

Furthermore, the coefficient for interaction is statistically insignificant in the secondary
regression analysis as well, which is also consistent with the results achieved with the
primary analysis.

In the table coefficients for the independent variables, the
number of observations, and R-square values are presented.

However, the coefficient for leverage is greater compared to the results achieved with the
primary regression analysis and, thus, the coefficient for interaction is not great enough
to change the coefficient for leverage positive, when risk of business failure equals 1.
Consequently, this means that high leverage affects profitability in high-risk firms less
negatively, but the relationship is still positive, which conflicts with the hypothesis of the
study. Moreover, certain other similarities and differences exist between results from the
primary and the secondary regression analysis. For example, the effect of variables
leverage, size, age, and asset turnover differ in direction between models, while the effect
of variables risk and patents seems to be similar. Furthermore, the R-square measured
with the Cox-Snell R-square is slightly weaker in the secondary regression analysis.

6 DISCUSSION
In this chapter, the results of the study will be discussed, and implications of the findings
will be presented. The results will be discussed by reflecting on previous research as well
as the used theories. Furthermore, an outlook for future studies and the limitations of this
thesis will be presented. The discussion will mainly focus on the results achieved with
the primary regression analysis, since the secondary analysis had only a verifying
purpose, but certain implications of the results from the secondary analysis will be
presented as well.

6.1 Discussion of the results
The results of the regression analyses indicated the inclusion of the interaction variable
to affect the coefficient for leverage, hence risk of business failure seemed to affect the
relationship between profitability and capital structure. The strength of the effect differed
to some extent between primary and secondary analysis, but the effect was still
observable. However, the effect of the interaction variable was statistically insignificant,
which indicated the interaction variable to be an unimportant variable in the regression
models and, consequently, the role of business failure risk as an affecting factor in the
relationship between capital structure and profitability can be questioned. Despite of the
statistical insignificancy of the results in the regression analyses, differences in the
relationship between capital structure and profitability were observable considering the
level of business failure risk in the firms.
Nonetheless, statistically significant results were achieved when firms with high and low
risk of business failure were compared. For example, firms with low risk of business
failure had significantly higher profitability and asset turnover as well as their capital
structure was less debt-weighted. These findings support the hypothesis of the study,
since the hypothesis development was based on the assumption of different business
environments depending on the firm’s risk of business failure. For example, firms with
low risk of business failure were assumed to have better ability to generate profits, which
is supported by the results of univariate tests.
To summarize, some support for the hypothesis of the study was found, even though the
null hypothesis could not be statistically rejected and the results from secondary analysis
59

differed compared to primary analysis. As the purpose of the study was to examine
whether the relationship between capital structure and profitability is driven by the risk
of business failure among Finnish listed firms, support for risk of business failure as an
affecting factor in the relationship was found, but the effect of business failure risk was
statistically insignificant. In conclusion, risk of business failure can be observed to affect
the relationship between capital structure and profitability among Finnish listed firms, but
this observation can not be statistically confirmed.

6.2 Discussion of the results in the study’s empirical context
Before making any conclusions of the results, interpreting them in the empirical context
of the study is worthwhile. Especially, as the results were statistically insignificant,
finding possible reasons for that can offer further aspects for future research. Firstly, the
sample size is relatively small, which may have affected the results. As discussed in
section 2.7, Finland is a little market that has quite strict legislation and suffers from a
lack of investors (Kasanen et al., 1996, 285). Consequently, the number of firms listed in
Helsinki Stock Exchange is quite modest, which has affected the sample size in this study
as well. Furthermore, the sample in form of firm-year observations consist mainly of same
firms, which means that one firm’s percentage of the sample is relatively high. These
factors are likely to explain the abnormality of the data as well as they may explain
statistical insignificancy of the results.
Secondly, the Finnish capital markets have certain special characteristics that may have
had an impact onto the results of the study. As discussed in section 2.7, bank-dominance,
large institutional owners, and high quality of firms’ governance are typical for the
Finnish capital markets (Karjalainen, 2011, 91; Niskanen & Keloharju, 2000, 460-461;
Miihkinen, 2013, 313). In practice, these characteristics often lead to the debt-dominated
external financing, a concentrated ownership structure, and reduced agency costs. Based
on the discussion in section 3.2, these characteristics were expected to overall decrease
agency costs between shareholders and managers as well as between debt and equity
holders, hence the effect of business failure risk on the relationship was assumed to be
weaker. Therefore, these characteristics may offer explanations why the effect of business
failure risk were observable but statistically insignificant.

60

Although, the characteristics of the Finnish capital markets can be seen as a possible
consequence for statistical insignificancy of the results, the results can also be seen as an
evidence for the specialty of the Finnish markets. As the agency costs were assumed to
be lower among Finnish listed firms and, consequently, the effect of business failure risk
on the relationship was assumed to be weaker, the results of this thesis offer potential
evidence for the presumption. Since the effect was observable but statistically
insignificant, this may indicate about reduced agency costs among Finnish listed firms.
However, this is only one of the multiple possible explanations for the statistical
insignificancy of the results and the results of this thesis will verify none of them.
Consequently, the reduced agency costs among Finnish listed firms can not be confirmed
with the results of this thesis, thus further research is needed.
The discussion above implicates that the achieved results are precisely specified for the
Finnish listed firms. If the sample is changed to, for example, to consist of firms operating
in a totally different business environment, I suppose that the results would be different.
Similar result could be achieved in similar bank-dominated and well-functioning markets,
but differences could be found as well. Consequently, this highlights the importance of
interpreting results in the study’s empirical context. The results of this study offer
valuable information of the effect of business failure risk on the relationship between
capital structure and profitability for Finnish listed firms but severing of the results from
their context may be detrimental.

6.3 Evaluation of the results
In this chapter, the value of the results will be evaluated by reflecting the findings on the
previous research and the used theories. Also, certain theoretical and practical
implications of the results as well as outlook for future studies will be presented, while
simultaneously the limitations of the study will be highlighted.

6.3.1 Linking the results to used theories
As discussed above, the results of the study indicate the effect of business failure risk on
the relationship between capital structure and profitability to be observable but
61

statistically insignificant. However, these results are suggested to be influenced by the
special characteristics of the Finnish capital markets, hence a possible explanation for the
statistical insignificancy can be found. Although, the results of primary analysis were
statistically insignificant and, therefore, the validity of the results can be questioned,
certain support for the used theories can be found.
The hypothesis of the study relies on the theory of the principal-agent problem, proposed
by Jensen and Meckling (1976), which highlights the agency costs that occur between
different stakeholders in a firm. The assumption for the hypothesis is that in firms with
high risk of business failure the reduction of the agency costs by monitoring is more
profitable compared to low-risk firms due to high-risk firms’ more vulnerable business
environment that limits, for example, their ability to generate profits. Some support for
this theory is found as the results suggested the difference in the effect of business failure
risk on the relationship to be observable. The effect of business failure risk was
statistically insignificant, but statistically significant results were found when the
differences between firms with high and low risk of business failure were analyzed. For
example, the high-risk firms had on average significantly lower profitability and higher
leverage that limit their business possibilities and, furthermore, support the theory of
different business environments between firms with high and low risk of business failure.
Furthermore, the theories about Finnish capital markets were used to hypothesize the
effect of study’s empirical context to the functionality of the agency cost theory. As
discussed in section 3.2, the Finnish capital markets have their own characteristics that
were assumed to influence the results of the study by diminishing the agency costs among
Finnish listed firms. Since the results showed the effect of business failure risk to be
observable but statistically insignificant, the lower agency costs among Finnish listed
firms can be seen as a possible consequence for insignificancy and, consequently, the
theories highlighting the special characteristics of the Finnish capital markets are
supported. However, it should be considered that the characteristics of Finnish capital
markets are only one of the multiple possible explanations for statistical insignificancy,
hence the specialty of Finnish markets cannot be verified with the results of the study.

62

6.3.2 Linking the results to previous research
The relationship between capital structure and profitability has been examined thoroughly
in different empirical contexts during the last few decades. Both positive and negative
relationships have been found and, obviously, the results from model 1 support the
positive relationship following such studies as Wippern (1966), Grossman and Hart
(1982) and Jensen (1986). Furthermore, the positive relationship between capital structure
and profitability is in line with the principal-agent problem, as high leverage is assumed
to motive firm managers to lead the firm in a way, which generates more cash flow in
order to repay the debt. However, the main objective of the study was to examine the
effect of business failure risk on the relationship in question. Previous research has
examined different factors that may affect the relationship, but the risk of business failure
has been disregarded by previous research so far. The study by Li et al. (2019) examined
the effect of credit risk on the relationship between capital structure and firm performance
and can be seen as the nearest counterpart for this study. The results achieved by Li et al.
(2019) were relatively similar with the results of this thesis. They found statistically
significant support for the effect of credit risk on the relationship, but the hypothesized
positive effect of credit risk on the relationship in firms with high credit risk was only
partly supported.
In fact, the comparison of the results of this thesis and the study by Li et al. (2019) can
be divided in two aspects: the results that are parallel and the results that differ. Similarly
to the results of this thesis, Li et al. (2019) observed a firm’s risk level to affect the
relationship between capital structure and firm success. Additionally, they also found the
effect of high leverage to be negative in firms with low risk level. In contrast to results of
this thesis, Li et al. (2019) found the effect of firms’ risk level to be statistically
significant, but the coefficient for this effect was not high enough to show a positive
relationship between high leverage and firm success in high-risk firms. Two main
implications can be drawn from these findings. Firstly, as both results indicated firms’
risk levels to affect the relationship, the risk level of a firm seems to play a role when
capital structure and firm success is considered. Secondly, as the results also differ to
some extent, the effect of risk level on the relationship seems to be dependent on other
factors as well.

63

The other factors that logically can support the differences in the results are, for example,
differences in samples, research periods, or ways to define and measure firm related risk
as well as firm success. These are factors that are related to the studies’ research settings,
but also an unresearched factor that has been omitted in the studies so far may affect the
results. In this thesis, in order to account for the effect of business failure risk on the
relationship between capital structure and profitability as specifically as possible, a set of
control variables were applied in the regression models. Obviously, it is impossible to
account all possible affecting factors in a regression model, hence a sort of trade off has
to be done when choosing control variables. However, in this thesis the prediction power
of the models is 20.3%, which indicates that the models can be improved. As by adding,
changing, and/or removing a variable(s), the prediction power of the models can be
improved, a critical evaluation of variables used in the study may offer important
knowledge for future research. Furthermore, the corresponding prediction power of the
models used by Li et al. (2019) was 9.3%, which indicates that the problem may be
common in studies related to this research area. Consequently, valuable knowledge can
be reached by examining the variables used in the studies as well as possible additional
variables that may improve the regression models.
Moreover, a possibly omitted factor could even explain the certain unsuccessfulness of
the used theories. Both, this thesis, as well as the study by Li et al. (2019) relied on the
principal-agent theory in hypothesizing the effect of risk on the relationship between
capital structure and firm success, but none of them achieved completely hypothesized
effects. Obviously, only few theories completely hold in practice, especially, when the
empirical context is closer to imperfect market conditions than perfect market conditions,
but still the principal-agent theory has been widely used by previous research with
successful results. Therefore, a critical evaluation of the theories used as well as
examining of possible omitted factors that may affect the functionality of used theories
could be valuable to consider in the future.

6.3.3 Contribution to existing research
Even though the results of the study offer similar as well as differing results, the
contribution to existing research is limited. As the findings of the study are mainly
statistically insignificant, the previous achieved results cannot be confirmed. Rather the
64

results reveal the need for further research as they differed from previous research to some
extent. As discussed, the differences may stem from differences in samples, research
periods or concept definitions, but the differences may also indicate about an excluded
factor that affects the results. However, despite of which the possible cause for the
differences in the results is, it highlights the importance of further research and, again,
argues for the importance of examining this subject.

6.3.4 Outlook for future studies
As the differences in the achieved results exist compared to previous research, the need
for further research is indisputable. The differences between results can stem from the
differences in the factors related to research settings, for example, the differences in the
sample, the research period, or the definition of firm risk or success, but as well the
differences can be dependent on an excluded factor. As the cause for the differences can
not be verified with the results of this study, the focus of future research on these
differences may offer valuable insights of this thesis’s results as well.
A solely replicate of this study is assumed to offer only scarce support for previous
research, hence a more comprehensive study focusing on, for example, the different
research settings may offer more valuable results. For instance, the change of a sample, a
research period, or a definition of firm risk or success, can offer valuable results of the
effect of firm related risk on the relationship between capital structure and firm success.
The change of a research setting can reveal, for example, if the effect of firm risk on the
relationship is dependent on factors such as geography, a research period, or a definition
of risk or success, which is valuable concerning the results of this thesis as well.
Furthermore, examining a possible additional variable that may affect the effect of firm
risk on the relationship between capital structure and firm success may be valuable.
Especially, if the effect of firm risk seemed to be independent of the factors related to the
research settings, a study considering to additional affecting factors would offer possible
further aspects into discussion. Moreover, the possibility of an additional factor to affect
the used theories in this thesis was discussed earlier. As neither this thesis nor the study
by Li et al. (2019) has achieved completely the hypothesized results, the functionality of
the used theories in this context as well as the possibility for that an omitted variable
65

affects the functionality of the theories shall be considered. As a result, valuable
knowledge regarding the effect of firm risk can be reached.

6.3.5 Limitations of the study
As already discussed, certain limitations have affected the results of the study as well as
the study itself. The sample of the thesis was limited to Finnish listed firms, which made
the sample size relatively small and, consequently, with a high likelihood, has affected
the validity of the study as well. Additionally, due to the specific characteristics of the
Finnish capital markets, the achieved results are specified to the study’s sample and
generalization to a larger population may be misleading. Also, the research period was
limited to the years between 2015 and 2019. Despite of the multi-year research period,
this thesis sought to be cross-sectional, but the possible longitudinal effect of the multiyear research period should also be considered since it may have had an effect on the
results. However, the longitudinal characteristics were sought to diminish by choosing as
coherent period as possible and by limiting the duration of the research period as short as
possible.
Additionally, this thesis is mainly based on accounting data and measures derived from
it, which limits the study in two ways. Firstly, as the study relies strongly on the measures
used as proxies for the variables, the study is dependent on how the proxies are measured.
Consequently, alternative ways to measure the variables can offer differing results. For
example, the measure used for risk of business failure is only one variant of the several
business failure risk measures, hence an alternative measure could classify firms
differently. Secondly, as the study relies mainly on accounting data, which is quantitative
by its nature, the study focuses on the research topic only from one perspective. For
example, a qualitative perspective could offer additional aspects of the topic and,
therefore, lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between capital structure and
profitability.
Even though this thesis approaches the research topic only from one perspective, the study
itself can be valuable in its own class. As the research technique used in the study is
quantitative by its nature, the value of the study should be evaluated by examining the
successfulness of the quantitative models used in the study. The results achieved with the
66

study’s regression models were statistically insignificant and, additionally, the
explanation power of the models was relatively low, even though on a sufficient level.
Consequently, the models can be seen slightly unsuccessful. However, the base of the
models is still seen solid as previous research has exploited similar models as well. In
fact, these results offer valuable knowledge for further research when, for example,
developing the regression models.

67

7 CONCLUSIONS
As previous research has shown a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between
capital structure and profitability, the purpose of this thesis was to examine if an
additional factor, namely risk of business failure, has an effect on the relationship. By
relying on the agency theory as well as the differences in business environments between
firms depending on their level of business failure risk, it was hypothesized that the
direction of the relationship between capital structure and profitability was dependent on
a firm’s risk of business failure.
The analysis was conducted by using data of Finnish listed firms, and the results showed
the effect of business failure risk on the relationship to be observable but statistically
insignificant. This was in line with the hypothesized effects, but the null hypothesis could
not be rejected due to the statistically insignificancy of the results. Additionally, the
differences in firm characteristics depending on a firm’s risk of business failure was
observable and statistically significant, which supported the idea of business failure risk
as an affecting factor. The achieved results were mainly similar with previous research
but offered differing findings as well. However, the contribution to existing research is
quite limited as the achieved results were statistically insignificant. In fact, the results
mainly only revealed the need for further research.
As this study differed from prior research in the research setting, the findings offer
multiple possibilities for further research to broad the understanding of the research topic.
By changing, for example, the sample, the research period, or the definition of firm risk
or success, a valuable knowledge of the research topic can be reached. Additionally, a
development of the regression models and a different approach of the research topic can
be valuable to consider in future as they can offer new perspectives of the research topic
and, thus, offer valuable knowledge.

8 SUMMARY IN SWEDISH
Påverkan av konkursrisk på sambandet mellan kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet: Empirisk
analys av finska börslistade bolag
Lönsamhet är ett av de viktigaste målen för företag och dess roll har blivit alltmer viktig
i dagens internationella och högkonkurrerande affärsvärld. Till följd av detta har
verktygen, som gynnar lönsamhet i företag, också blivit alltmer viktig. Under en längre
period har tidigare forskning debatterat om kapitalstrukturens betydelse för företagets
lönsamhet. Medan en del föreslår att ett samband mellan kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet
finns (Jensen, 1986; Cassar & Holmes, 2003), har andra hittat motsatta resultat (Soumadi
& Hayajneh, 2012; Abor, 2005). Eftersom det tycks fattas en konsensus om sambandet
mellan kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet, har de senaste studierna börjat att undersöka
möjliga andra faktorer som kan påverka sambandet.
Tidigare forskning har föreslagit att företagets risknivå är en av de möjliga faktorerna
som kan påverka sambandet. Till exempel Li, Niskanen och Niskanen (2019) fann att
påverkan av kapitalstruktur på företagets prestanda var beroende av företagets
kreditrisknivå. Ändå erbjuder uppnådda resultat tillsvidare bara svaga bevis på påverkan
av företagets risknivå på sambandet. Dessutom baserar uppnådda bevis sig främst på
enstaka synvinklar, vilket betonar betydelsen av vidare forskning. Således är målet för
denna avhandling att utöka förståelsen om ämnet genom att undersöka om företagets
konkursrisk påverkar sambandet mellan dess kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet i finska
börslistade företag.
För att öka förståelsen av ämnet samt tydliggöra avhandlingens syfte, definierar jag de
viktigaste begreppen och presenterar de viktigaste måtten som hör till ämnet. För det
första definieras lönsamhet som företagets förmåga att generera inkomster med dess
tillgångar (Dioha, Mohammed, and Okpanachi, 2018) och den kommer jag mäta med
nyckeltalet ROA (Return on Assets) i avhandlingen. För det andra betecknar tidigare
forskning kapitalstruktur som de olika valmöjligheterna i företaget gällande dess
finansiering och den kommer jag mäta med nyckeltalet skulder per totala tillgångar. För
det tredje uppfattas konkursrisk som en möjlighet att ett företag lägger ned sin
affärsverksamhet på grund av sin bristande förmåga att göra tillräcklig avkastning (Ahn,
Cho & Kim, 2000) och denna risk kommer jag mäta med ett mått som heter Altman Z-

69

score. Jag kompletterar Altman Z-score med data om revisionsutlåtanden för att
noggrannare kunna klassificera företagen baserad på deras konkursrisknivå.
Denna avhandling baserar sig på principal-agentteorin. Enligt teorin finns det flera aktörer
med olika prioriteter inom och runt omkring företag. Till exempel företagsledningen,
aktieägare och långivare driver främst sina egna intressen, vilket orsakar kostnader i
företaget. Företagsledningen kan minska dessa kostnader genom övervakning men
effekten av övervakningen anses vara beroende av företagets affärsverksamhet och
följaktligen även dess risknivå. Till exempel Li et al. (2019) har föreslagit att
övervakningen är mer lönsammare för företag som har hög risknivå, eftersom deras
affärsverksamhet oftast är mer sårbar och de har troligen naturlig brist på egna
kontrollsystemen. Baserat på denna diskussion har jag formulerat en hypotes:
H1: Företagets konkursrisknivå påverkar riktningen av sambandet mellan företagets
kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet.
Avhandlingens sampel består av bolag listade på Helsingforsbörsen (OMXH), och
tidsperioden är begränsad till åren mellan 2015 och 2019. Data är samlade från
databaserna Amadeus och Voitto+. Amadeus använde jag som primär datakälla, vilket
innebär att till exempel all finansiella data är hämtade därifrån. Emellertid saknar
Amadeus till exempel data om revisionsutlåtanden, varför jag använde Voitto+ som en
kompletterande datakälla. Det ursprungliga samplet bestod av 155 företag men på grund
av luckorna i data minskade samplet till 130 företag och 560 observationer. Dessutom
innehöll samplet relativt många uteliggande observationer, möjligtvis på grund av
storleken av samplet, varför jag använde IQR-metoden för att identifiera och därefter
eliminera de uteliggande observationerna. Efter kontrollering av de uteliggande
observationerna bestod det slutliga samplet av 452 observationer.
För att uppfylla studiens syfte, kommer jag bygga upp två regressionsmodeller. Båda
modellerna består av den beroende variabeln lönsamhet, den oberoende variabeln
kapitalstruktur, kontrollvariablerna konkursrisk, storlek, ålder, varumärken, patenten och
omsättning av tillgångar samt dummyvariabeln bransch. Dessutom har den andra
modellen en så kallad interaktionsvariabel som speglar effekten av företagets konkursrisk
på sambandet mellan kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet. För att testa regressionsmodellerna
använder jag huvudsakligen OLS-metoden men jag genomför tester även med 2SLSmetoden och logistisk regression för att verifiera resultatet. För övrigt använder jag
70

Mann-Whitney U-test och Pearson’s Chi-square för att testa skillnader mellan företag
med hög och låg konkursrisk.
Resultaten av regressionsanalyserna uppvisar att interaktionsvariabeln, som speglar
påverkan av konkursrisk på sambandet mellan kapitalstruktur och lönsamhet, påverkar
koefficienten för kapitalstruktur, men att själva interaktionsvariabeln inte är statistiskt
signifikant. Detta indikerar att man kan observera effekten av konkursrisk på sambandet
men att effekten inte är statistiskt signifikant. Resultaten av Mann-Whitney U-test och
Pearson’s Chi-square stödjer uppbyggandet av hypotesen, eftersom resultaten uppvisar
att statistisk signifikanta skillnader finns mellan företag med hög och låg konkursrisk,
vilket indikerar att skillnaderna i affärsverksamheten finns hos företag med olika
konkursrisknivå. Dock behöver man uppmärksamma att nollhypotesen inte kan förkastas
på grund av statistiskt osignifikanta resultaten i regressionsanalysen.
Även om resultaten inte erbjuder ett definitivt svar på avhandlingens forskningsfråga, är
uppnådda resultaten ändå värdefulla. Eftersom skillnader mellan resultaten i denna
avhandling och den tidigare forskningen finns, betonar det vikten av vidare forskning.
Troligtvis

beror

dessa

skillnader

på

till

exempel

skillnaderna

i

samplet,

undersökningsperioderna eller definitionerna av begreppen men de kan också bero på en
eller flera utelämnade faktorer. Således ser jag att resultaten av denna avhandling ger en
anledning till vidare forskning och även erbjuder en möjlighet för framtida forskning att
öka förståelsen om ämnet.
